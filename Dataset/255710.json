            "review_text": "In 2013, after 10 years of waiting, the Sim City community of modders, fans, and aficionados rushed out to purchase the fifth installment of Sim City. Ten years is a long time to wait for a game, but people had a lot of faith in Maxis when they announced the title. Long story short, it was a massive dissapointment. Maxis and EA crippled Sim City 5 with DRM, Always On APM, tiny maps, forced origin installation, lacking mod support, no steam support, and a forced multiplayer aspect. I decided to not purchase the title, so it may have been a decent game, but 2 years later a team of 12 people created a game that does everything maxis insisted was utterly and totaly impossible.   Everything the mod community did that kept Sim City 4 on the shelves in Wallmarts across America for an entire decade was ignored. Maxis (and to a lesser extent EA) ignored the fans, and gave the people who had kept them in business for twenty years a crippled subpar game. And for that Maxis is now out of business. They will never make another game, and it is no one's fault but theirs.  Now pretend none of that happened. It's 2013 again, and here it is people: Sim City 5.   The game balance is a bit on the easy side for veterans of the genre, but the potential map size is ENOURMOUS and customizing your city could fill up years of gameplay time. The game runs so smoothly with so much going on, it really shows how lazy Maxis was with their approach. The glass in buildings reflects the sun and the buildings near it, there are dynamic shadows, zoning is back, and it is not 'dumbed down'. A single tile in this game is twice the size of the alloted map in Sim City, and you can purchase dozens of additional tiles to expand. The map editor is awesome, the community is thriving, there are mods to do anything you want, and this is the city building game we've all been waiting for. I can not possibly reccomend this more.",

            "review_text": "Cities: Skylines is a City Builder/Simulation game, and it’s fantastic. Cities: Skylines absolutely destroys EA and Maxis’ 2013 effort, Sim City, in every conceivable way. Where Maxis managed to somehow fail in a genre they pretty much invented, Colossal Games and Paradox Interactive have treated Maxis’ effort as a treatise on what not to do.  This is, without a doubt, the game Sim City 2013 should have been.  First up, the graphics. Skylines is very well optimized, with large detailed cities bustling along with no hiccups, and some nice options in the settings to fiddle with if you do experience any problems. The game looks great, with lots of detail. Buildings grow and “level up” as you watch, changing their value and appearance and attracting different types of people and businesses. You can easily identify different areas and specialties, as well as transport, power and sewerage systems by colour using the (mostly) intuitive UI. Clicking on people, houses and buildings will give you more details, and identifying problems (or successes) is made very easy.  The gameplay is where Skylines shines, however. You’ll be juggling residents needs and wants by ensuring access to clean water, power, efficient transportation, entertainment and medicine, to name just a few. You’ll have to control pollution, both physical and noise, crime and disease. There are a variety of ways to do this, how you go about it is up to you.  You’ll start by placing roads. Then zone areas off the roads into a category: Residential, Industrial, Retail and Office. Then set up a functioning power grid and clean water/waste water sewerage system. After that, it’s all about placing public services to attract more people, and expanding your city across the map. And what a map! You initially start on each map with a 2 square kilometre parcel of land in which to build, but can expand out over 8 such parcels out of 25 available per map. That said, it is trivial to mod out the limitation, and if your computer can handle it, you absolutely can build on the entire map. As a bonus, if you don’t like any of the premade maps the game ships with, you can easily use the in-game map editor to create (or recreate!) your own map to play on. There is even an asset editor too, so you can create and modify the in game assets to your preferences.  The game systems make sense, and work how you’d expect them to. This is a simulation game, after all! After you’ve finished zoning your city, you can then create districts, which allow you to apply policies city wide or just to select areas. Make the CBD have compulsory smoke detectors and free public transport, while giving the poor and destitute section of town a rebate on green energy. Ban heavy vehicles from residential areas to lower noise and decongest traffic!  Industries will make you money, but require careful planning. Take advantage of natural oil reserves, mine ore, farm, cut down your forests or simply go for “Generic”, where you’ll be making random stuff. The finance and taxation system is easily understood and superb.   The game models traffic behaviour very well and in fact figuring out a way to manage high density traffic is one of the hardest aspects of playing Skylines. To that end, you’re given plenty of options, such as numerous road types, public transport, cargo ships, trains and aeroplanes.  Surprisingly, the game has an incredibly effective water simulation too; Dams will burst and water flows realistically throughout the map, and pollution will be carried downstream with currents.  The icing on the cake for Cities: Skylines is the fact that Skylines is 100% mod friendly, with integrated Steam Workshop support. People have already uploaded thousands of custom maps and assets to the workshop, as well as gameplay tweaks and it’s pretty safe to say that if you find something wrong with the game that you think could be better, there is a very good chance that there is already a mod for it on the workshop.  Now you’ve heard me gush over how great this game is, what are the cons?  The game doesn’t auto-save! This is a real pain if you mess up. But, there is a mod for that.  There is no day/night cycle, which would have been nice. But, there is a mod for that.  The camera doesn’t let me go low enough to get a good look of my city streets up close. But, there is a mod for that. There is another one that enables a First Person View from and person you click on in the street!  Not a lot of maps to choose to play on. But, the workshop has hundreds available, downloaded and added to the available maps with a single click.  There is even a mod that allows you and a friend to explore your cities in First Person online, using the in game people as avatars. Why? Who knows! But it’s possible!   In conclusion, if you like city builders or simulation games, you cannot go wrong with Cities: Skylines. It is everything you could want out of this genre.  Sim City, eat your heart out.",

            "review_text": " Q: What I think of this game?   A: Best city builder game I played... ever... period   Q: What I don’t like about it?   A: Traffic does need to be fine tuned, and I feel mods are necessary to balance the game, but it's very tedious...   Q: What about user generated content?   A: Workshop community has been very impressive, adding so many cool things to the game.   I am at a point where I feel I am missing out on amazing mods and content, because there are so many to choose from, and I can't invest the time to try them all.   But how can you really complain from having too much choice, so forget I just said that...   Q: Does it worth the price?   A: Price might seem a bit steep to some, but for any fan of city builder games, you'll get your money's worth in the first week... and probably lose a bit of grasp on reality at the same time.   Bottom line, you will get a lot more then what you pay for, so why wait?   Q: What I would love to see added to the game?   A: I would like to see some scenarios of some kind being added.   Milestones are great, and sandbox opens so many possibilities... yet still, I would like to have the option of being guided or limited to specific objectives.  It would help me understand some parts of the game better, and bring my game to another level.   Q: What are my advices when playing the game?   A: The game expects you to be a pro at this; you'll have to make a lot of mistakes before you find your way.  It's easy to 'cheat' the game, but it will not make it more fun.   - Watch tutorials to get some ideas  - Use mods with caution, they can improve the game, but can also break it...  - Help rating user generated content, rating takes 5 seconds and creators should get recognition for their work - Make suggestions, Colossal Order and Paradox are listening to the feedback and are not wasting any time   Q: What would I like to say to Paradox and Colossal Order’s team?   A: You have given me what I was waiting for! THANK YOU!   But you have also stolen 100 hours of my life already... Are you proud? I am sure you are ;)   You’ve set new standards in the way a game should be delivered to the community and updated based on user feedback, and all gamers will benefit from your work.   Kudos to everyone!!!   Q: Where am I going?   A: Sorry, I have a city to build... goodbye!",

            "review_text": "This is the game awaited by the city building community for 12 years, a proper, full 3D successor to SimCity 4. It is incredibly fun, insanely addictive and somewhat challenging, although it has some minor drawbacks.  Pros: + It is so addictive I spent 36 hours playing it in the first three days after I got it + Transportation system is very detailed, and agent-based simulation works very nicely with it + Zoning works very nicely with free-form roads + The available territory is quite big - up to 36 square kilometers in base game (9 tiles), up to 100 square kilometers with a simple mod (25 tiles) and whopping 324 (!) square kilometers with the less stable 81 tile enabler + Unique and fully working fluid dynamics system + Districts and policies allow for fine control over your city + Globally unlocked buildings help to vary playstyle in different cities - from building an eco-friendly utopia with lots of parks and low taxes to an industrial hellhole full of illness and crime + Modding is quite encouraged - the community is very active and the tools are easy to use; by now there are hundreds of great mods and assets avalable on the Workshop + Dev team keeps in touch with the community and pays a lot of attention to the feedback + Free patches significantly improve the game, introducing great features like tunnels, European themed buildings, day-night cycle, in-game terraforming, canals and quays, increased object limits and improved mod tools  Cons: - It's not very challenging past the first 10k - the biggest hurdles left are traffic and congestion (there are numerous mods rebalancing the game to be harder more realistic, but I can't vouch for their quality) - The amount of assets included in the base game is relatively small (but bigger than on release), so you'll see a lot of repetition (although it is remedied by mods and community-created assets, you have to keep an eye on RAM and VRAM consumption) - Day/night cycle doesn't really make much of a difference in vanilla gameplay (again, there's an excellent mod which overhauls the mechanic - Rush Hour)  All in all, Cities: Skylines is an amazing game that's certainly worth a purchase, especially with its low price. But you may not enjoy it as much if you are not a fan of the genre.",

            "review_text": "Do you like creation, or city building? If yes to either, give this game a long look. The two primary ways (soon to be three with the release of scenarios as part of the free update for the Disasters DLC) you'll probably play this game will be either sandboxing with infinite money, or more vanilla which won't use mods.   What I love: Scale - The maps are massive. Even in vanilla in which you have access to 9 tiles out of a possible 81, you have a massive space to develop, decorate and grow. As a point of reference, Sim City 2013 maximum city space is equal to 1 square in Cities: Skylines. As a bonus, there are thousands of player created maps in the steam workshop, some of which provide fantastic settings to grow an empire or a small rural city.   Living Cities - The people and the traffic all have a life, a destination; they're not simply arbitrary numbers detailing their supposed existence. You will be tasked to provide the infrastructure they need to live and will be critical to succeed as mayor, civil engineer, and accountant of your city.   Cities: Traffic Wars - Some love it, some hate it. I love traffic wars. I love the problem solving, the beautification designing of interchanges; it's a very rewarding feeling when you solve traffic problems successfully. Nothing wrong with that. Yes, there is quirky behavior, but it doesn't detract massively from the experience. I have a couple tips: Leave space for traffic to filter and minimize weaving. That goes a long way. There are player guides that tackle how to solve typical traffic issues such as How to Traffic and even guides that look at traffic flow theory and how it applies to this game.   Workshop - Mod support and a massive amount of player content means there are enormous number of ways to build a city. Mods provide powerful options to take control, and build with massive freedom. Download responsibly and there will be minimal issues. You aren't limited to zoning and plopping, you can create beautiful, planned cities. The only limitation is your imagination.  Not so great: DLC - A bit pricey for what you get, excluding After Dark. That dlc is excluded, and I would definitely take no issue paying full price on. Very feature rich. Unfortunately, the same level of praise is not really warranted for Snowfall. Trams and snow maps are nice, but I would not buy it full price.   Vanilla gameplay - As a first time experience to get achievements, it's fine in its own right, but in comparison to what you can do with the player content regarding the mods (you can use building assets, props, etc. in vanilla), the gameplay is limited and quality of life for the player tends to be lower with the lack of performance mods.  Difficulty - This is a double edged sword. Lack of difficulty is beneficial to those that simply want to build, grow and show off their skills with infrastructure building, and city painting. This is a negative for anyone that wants a challenging economy in vanilla. This will hold particularly true if you like that kind of gameplay in Simcity. Fortunately, for the challenge inclined, you can make it much harder on yourself with mods, and Scenarios are coming out soon, which will provide win and lose condition scenarios as part of the Disasters dlc. It will be free.  TLDR: Love building, traffic wars, the almost endless beautification options, and I can be a major creep as I roleplay God with my topdown world view as I stalk a handsome young man coming home from work as he goes home to sleep at night (he actually does live in that house). Glorious. Would I recommend to anyone that remotely likes city builders? Absolutely.",

            "review_text": "Oh boy, this ♥♥♥♥ing game.  Cities: Skylines is Sim City. No need to call it a spiritual successor or anything, this game apes Sim City in every way as far as I can tell. I recall faint memories of attempting to play Sim City 2000 back when I was a little kid but the interface and gameplay was far too complex for me. I had more fun loading up the pre-set savegames of a sprawling metropolis and destroying it with robots or aliens and whatnot. I don't even really have any experience with any city simulators. However, this game does a modern Sim City better than any other game has done in recent memory.  I don't have much experience with any city simulators. Now, I'm certifiably addicted to this game. The interface is stellar, the music charming. The sound effects are invigorating. The little dings as buildings level up fill my heart with happiness. The way your tiny ant-like populace pours out of your metro system after arrival is satisfying, as you know they're not using congestion-inducing personal vehicles. The ability to 'paint' different zones, whether residential, commerical, or industrial is so delightful it's difficult to describe. Watching little buildings pop up, filling with residents populating the area is incredible to behold. You can even name every single object in the game, whether it be a building, a citizen, or even some random cougar roaming in the countryside. I took it upon myself to name every High School I built after any American presidents i can think of.  I never thought this would happen, but as of 3/16/15 Cities: Skylines is my GOTY of 2015. It's been quite some time when a video game can suck away my time as well as this one. There's always more land to develop, more resources to export, more ways to attempt to fix your horribly congested traffic ♥♥♥♥ups. While the game doesn't do a perfect simulation, as the AI drivers refuse to take up multiple lanes in some instances, the amount of detail is incredible. Everyone wants to go somewhere, and all the cars are traveling with a purpose. It is important to make sure all the needs of your city are met, whether it be water, waste, dead people, sick people, schooling, fires, it really becomes overwhelming really quick. In fact, most of your first attempts at this game will create perpetual hellholes of civilization, tall gloomy buildings stuffed with stinking dead bodies and backed up sewage. However, in my opinion this does only galvanizes you to make your city better, by redirecting traffic and building public transports to lessen the load on commuter roads. Who knew city planning could be so fun?  Cities: Skylines isn't perfect, as evidenced by the traffic stingy AI and sometimes confusing circumstances where pressing criteria around the city aren't clear. There aren't any disasters that can hurt your city (other than accidental flooding from a Hydroelectric Dam). However, as seen by the ridiculous amount of mods that have hit the steam workshop a mere few days after release, this may be remedied. You can even create your own landscape using the map editors, and I dread to see what messing around with that will do my free time in the future.  If you have any interest in city simulations at all, you need to get this game now. Probably the best one to come out in a long, long time.",

            "review_text": "I had actually started to believe that we were never going to see another great city simulator and then Paradox sprung this on us. Cities: Skylines went back to the simulators that were fun, pulled the best parts of them, and upgraded them to today's standards. It's fun without being overly punishing but still provides a challenge for those of us who want it. Sure it isn't perfect, but there are few games that even scratch that lofty goal.  Probably the biggest issue is the lifespan of the citizens. All citizens lead a perfect and full life. This means if you have 2000 people move into your city all at once, they all die at the same time. It's really frustrating until you realize what's happening at the simulation. But there's a mod that changes that, giving citizens variable length lives.  But that's the only  real  problem with this game. There can be some other gripes made about performance of 100k+ cities and traffic management nightmares, but I've never met a modern simulator that doesn't have those issues. Simply put, if you want a city simulator that's worth the money, you can't go wrong with Cities: Skylines.",

Each starting city part is already bigger than tiny SimCity maps and you can buy adjacent lands to make it x9 times bigger still.  - Smarter traffic controls. Though there are some issues with cars disappearing or turning in the middle of the road or going through each other - at least routing works. You don't have to wait hours for an ambulance or fire truck to reach its point, garbage gets collected, resources get sold.  - Paint and fill tools for zoning (finally!).  - Road connections can be edited. You are not restricted to just one entry point.  - Pipes and power lines are back.  - Can move buildings to another spot for a fee.  - Fluid mechanics when placing an electric dam.  - Overall better UI, city info panels and responsiveness (no fudged data like in SimCity - the number of workers and residents adds up).  Cons:  - Plopping/building snapping. Unfortunately they added the same damn thing as in SimCity and restricted placing buildings only near roads. This results in a lot of wasted space between road connections and in small spaces. It cannot be switched off either.  - No tutorial whatsoever and the hint system doesn't cover everything. Took me a while to realize that my elderly population doesn't work and i have to constantly build new houses like in Banished.  - No landscaping tools.  - Not enough parks. Most of them are huge so there is really no way to make beautiful city centres unless you are building in squares.  - Weather and time of day do not change.  - Zoning and placing roads is often a chore since they rarely snap at proper angles... again unless you build in squares.  - Annoying sounds and twitteresque replacement of the 'news ticker' from SimCity.  - Biased approach to power plants - they are basically forcing you to be eco friendly since wind turbines are cheaper and more efficient than everything else. This is very unrealistic and unfair in my opinion.  - Can't view overlays and build at the same time. Huge oversight since you need to know where to zone industrial for ore and farm placement.  - All of the public transportation lines look the same, got same colour (all of the bus lines are the same colour and all of the metro lines too) and are generally hard to create and distinguish.  - Lack of building upgrades. This probably was the only good idea from SimCity that should've been copied here.  Overall there are quite a few annoyances and issues at the moment but all of them are compensated by the fact that this game is actually fun and doesn't feel like a couped up tiny sandbox like SimCity.  Its definitely better than CitiesXL as well, since it performs and runs smoother, uses more than 1 core, does not appear to have memory leaks and feels generally better made. The only issue i've encountered so far is some sound stuttering.  So i can recommend this if you like city building games and were disappointed by every other game in the last few years.",

(DLC, DRM) It does takes quite a bit aspects from SimCity 2013 though (honestly a scary amount) but thankfully leaves all of the bad ones out.   With regards to how it compares to SimCity 4 though, I'd say SC4 is still superior but just barely. Cities: Skylines offers a more simpler and easier yet less balanced economic system than SC4 did, which isn't necessarily a good thing. SC4 also had better information screens, the ability to modify landscape in-game, and doesn't have this questionable building unlocking progression. Also, I need to mention the lack of 'God' controls and commands such as disasters that SimCity 4 did have.  But thankfully, the game has just been released and the dev team will continue to make updates for months maybe years to come and the modding community for this game is already phenomenal.

The game allows you to build insansly large cities, and the modding community is already pushing out some really cool stuff, especialy with the asset and map editor being a thing.   It does not have the same kind of quarkyness that simcity has, and wont have the same kind of random events, but it is satisfying to watch the city grow.  My only real problem with the game is that it does not tailor it's self way to new players. If you are new to the city building genre then be prepared to fail a lot, as this game will punish you for the smallest of mistakes.

            "review_text": "A fantastic citybuilder, my favourite since SimCity 4.  Since the most likely points of comparison here are SimCity 2015 and Cities XL, I'll break it down into quick points:   Compared to SimCity 2015:  -Game's fully offline. The only online aspect is the integration with Steam Workshop. -Deep modding. Game include's both a map editor and an asset editor. Workshop is already bursting at the seams with stuff. -Giantic room for constructing cities. You start with a single 2x2 km square, and you can eventually purchase 8 more squares. There's already mods allowing to purchase all 25 squares a map has (that's 100 sq km). -Cims (Skylines' version of Sims) are fully simulated and actually make sense. -Traffic simulation is incredibly deep (though there's still some issues with cars accumulating in a single lane sometimes). -No building upgrade. -Specialization is not as deep as in SimCity, but the District system allows you to essentially create individual cities within the same map, with their own laws, taxes, and industrial focuses. -Several info overlays are almost copied from SimCity, even in their presentation. -Skylines is less colourful than SimCity, but also a bit more realistic. -Music isn't bad in Skylines, but SimCity's better.   Compared to Cities XL  -Map are just a little bit smaller (Cities XL has 110 sq km, Skylines has 100 sq km with mods, 36 sq km without). -Zoning is much, more comfortable, particularly with curved roads. -No lag (although large cities can be taxing depending on your computer). Brisk road building even for huge tracks. -Graphics are somewhat similar. -Interface is far more user-friendly. -Traffic simulation is orders of magnitude more interesting. -Road variety is more or less the same (just in terms of types. Skylines' free-form roadbuilding allows for pretty much unlimited road-building methods). -So far, I've encountered not a single memory leak or similarly wrecking bug.  Overall, the game is great. It is true it is in some aspects less deep than SimCity 4 and it does have some usability nuances (such as zoning not always looking exactly the way you want, though this is the price we pay for free-form orientation, I suppose), but it does so much stuff so great that you quickly let that pass. Traffic itself is so well done that it becomes a game unto itself (which is no wonder, considering the game was developed by the same people behind Cities in Motion).  Modding support is also excellent. Though the base game comes with a somewhat limited variety of buildings, ten minutes in the Workshop will land you with several dozen new structures that will seamless integrate into your cities, and new stuff is being made faster than we can check it.  Some of the missing stuff, such as tunnels, is already being considered as free DLCs in the near future.  10/10 game. This is both the citibuilder we wanted and the citibuilder we deserved.",

            "review_text": "Really love this game. It's what Sim City 2013 should have been.   Plenty of teething problems that need patching though. Poor multi-lane traffic behaviour for one. Vehicles tend not to pass eachother and clump up when merging regardless of the number of lanes. Highway ramps are waay too good. They are one direction, single lane but vehicles go full highway speed on them, regardless of what you're joining to, making them a panacea for traffic troubles. Jam at a junction? throw down some ramps! kinda fun though.  Sweet water physics in this game but don't bother building a hydro dam. The resevoir becomes static and you get no energy out after a while, at which point you may as well mercilessly delete it and wipe out your newly zoned industrial district because what the hell you made a save point just before. Also the flood plains don't become any more fertile, and space is plentiful in this game, so what's the point? Huge tankers can (as is a rule in city-sims) turn on a dime at 180 degrees a second in shallow waters, but harbors still need to be placed in direct line of sight to sea... what? Why can't they navigate a simple estuary? Helmsman is wasted potential.  I had a major problem with garbage. You can't simply remove dumps without emptying them first. When you empty, say to an incinerator, ALL the dumps trucks are used to empty it, and still takes forever, making the city suffer... if you don't notice thats whats happening. Also dead people (if they die in residences) are not dealt with by ambulences. You need hearses to come pick them up. Not only that, but like dumps, cemetaries become full, so with a click of a button the church is digging up the bodies, throwing them back in the hearse and driving them to the crematorium. ♥♥♥♥ing brilliant.  Districts and policies are a great feature. Combined with the sheer map sizes, they make it feel like a real city. You can have a high density downtown with a rent thats too damn high, an industrial district with reduced safety laws, more accidents and huge profits, some farms, a woodland reserve, a Beverly Hills with ridiculous taxes and high land value, all while forgetting about Jim who lives next to the dump and is dying from air, water and noise polution (yes, noise does hospitalise people in this game. ♥♥♥♥ing genius.)  Despite all the extra challenges, its still very easy to make a huge income. Partially because a lot of the expensive services pay toward themselves, you have loads of space to work with (See achievement 'SIMulated City: Have an area the size of nine map tiles' - shots fired) but mainly because freight harbors are OP as ♥♥♥♥. Shame there isn't too much of an end-game as Sim City, as that had Godzilla, zombie outbreaks and Great Works... Definitely missing out on these features. I mean come on, you need cemetaries to hold the dead... it logically follows that when it maxes capacity there should be zombie incidents. Someone make this happen with mods, please?  TL;DR: Solves the problems of Sim City, creates a couple of its own.

This game also earns a plus on a near flawless release(when compared to its competition), and I have confidence that it become more than what Sim City 4 had became, in less amount of time(Sim City 4 does have a decade+ of development).  My only complaint, and it's merely opinion oriented, is I wish this game used a darker saturation for the color of its buildings and vehicles. I personally wish they would have used a similar color scheme as Cities in Motion 2(for realism). However, with the mod community, you are able to change this.

The game is fairly easy so far, and I've expanded my city fast, but it's still only about an eighth it's full potential size.  Some things are missing. No modular buildings, no day/night cycle, and the graphics are *slightly* less impressive than Sim City.

Cities: Skylines doesn't try to do any fancy new tricks like multiplayer or city connections. Instead it's an oldschool city builder game that we all love and it looks great.   The game is already great as it is, but with any future DLC or expansion it will become even better. While I'm usually not a huge one of DLC's, I really like the way Paradox releases them. Every DLC seems worth the money as there a good amount of new content and they often include some of the stuff in free patch also. So while the game in my opinion is already the best city builder game to day, there's is so much more potential to it.   Paradox is also known for their great support for modding and Cities: Skylines is not an expectation. If something is not in the game you can always make it yourself and there's a good change that someone has already done it. With the great modding support the game has nearly endless amount of potential so it will only get better as the time goes by. Just like SimCity 4 did back in the days.  So if you are into the city building games, but you were disappointed with the crappy SimCity or/and the scam Cities XXL, then this is the game for you. I can highly recommend the game for anyone who's interested of the games of this genre. It's by far the best one and will only get better.",

Not anymore, you can change absolutely everything to suit your preferences and gameplay style. Once you get taken into your citizen’s messages via chirper it is unbelievably easy to lose time whilst playing this game. I cannot tell you how much time I’ve spent re-routing traffic in order to get it working smoothly, so don’t be surprised if a quick fix for heavy traffic areas become a grand plan that takes more than the quick couple of minutes you had anticipated before starting.

Following what SimCity 2013 brought of issues, terrible choices and problems, this game was released with a lot of similar ideas, but making pretty much all of them better. It is really fun building your city and placing your public services to offer power, police, education, and others. It is a great challenge to manage space for all of it. And for this I recommend playing this game without placing service buildings and roads over residences, commerce or industries. It makes a much better challenge that got me to enjoy the challenge much more.   While really fun to build and plan your city, the variety of buildings makes me feel like there is slightly too few options and no modifications or customization to the buildings, but I really don't think this takes anything away from the game, it is more like something I'd like than something that is missing from the game. And when you know that a group of 13 people made all of this, it feels like it's not really missing anything. On the other side, the lack of expansible service buildings help you make better use of space if compared to EA's SimCity 2013.  The best part of the game is probably the traffic management. Following the Cities in Motion games, that the focus was to manage traffic, many amazing ideas and features come from it. The way that you can manually build roads, railways and metro lines is amazing, giving space for a lot of different ideas and customization, you can build it the way you want it to be. I spent a lot of hours building and rebuilding roads, planning bus lines, bringing railways from far away to transport people and cargo from and to the city, and planning how my metro lines and stations would be placed.  The traffic is not without it's flaws. Sometimes you can place a 6 lane road and for some reason all the vehicles will be using only one of them and making a huge line instead of spreading around and allowing the traffic to flow. In some cases it's possible to fix this situation, but not everytime.  And one other thing that I really missed is any kind of negotiations with neighbor cities. I'm not talking about the multiplayer ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t from SimCity 2013, but something like how it was on Sim City 3000, that is a great game that had a nice feature that you could make agreements with neighbor towns, it was really nice.  My final verdict is very positive, I think this game is great and if you're into city building, or even have a slight interest in it, you should buy this game. It is at a reasonable price, and offers a lot, it will probably take away dozens of hours of your time, but you will enjoy these hours.  I'm really looking forward for what can be made better in this game and in a possible sequel, but am also afraid of the strategy from Paradox of selling 10 thousand DLC's per game. Hope it's not the case for this game, that the DLC's offer really good content for a acceptable price.",

            "review_text": "This is hands-down one of the finest city building games I have ever played.  I've enjoyed games throughout the entire Simcity series (from 3000 on and excluding the newest) and on to smaller-scale management games such as the Anno series. Although these are good games, few have been as utterly absorbing as Cities: Skylines.  The game is reasonably 'easy' in the sense that you won't encounter a steep difficulty curve from the economic side of the simulation. That is, you're probably not going to run out of money, and before long your coffers will be so full you'll have more money than spending options.  However, the real difficulty comes from the optimization, and it's baked into the game's design so organically that it makes you wonder why it hasn't been done before. If you want a large city with skyscrapers, you will have to get your services in your neighborhoods 'just so' to get them to appear. You will hit population resistance points where you simply cannot grow unless you've optimized your layout, traffic, services, and so on.  The traffic system can be a game unto itself, I found myself spending 45 minutes designing a complex 'spaghetti bowl' traffic structure in the heart of my city, then watching and fine tuning it for the next hour or two by adding lanes, changing distances, or rerouting traffic to prevent jams. You can even watch the composition of traffic to get hints (lots of trucks means the industrial area is contributing too much traffic, etc.)  You'll spend a lot of time looking, and then making small adjustments, but you won't mind thanks to the gorgeous diorama-style graphics.  Simcity made it easy to get overzealous, and as your city grew you often found yourself 'putting out fires' (sometimes literally) to keep it running, the larger the city, the more new wrinkles would show up that you would be constantly addressing. Cities: Skylines takes on a different style, moment-to-moment management of your city is reasonably relaxed, but if you want it to become a powerhouse metropolis, you'll have to master a number of systems and make it as efficient as possible. And then the traffic jams start...  I can't recommend it highly enough for anyone looking for a relaxed city builder with enough depth there to chew on if you want it. It's a masterwork of game design and should be experienced by anyone with even a slight interest in city builders, and the Steam Workshop is well-integrated with loads of additional content available.",

            "review_text": "This is a great game. Sim City 4 will still always hold a special place in my heart but this one comes very close, if not with the flaws of Sim City 4 balanced out with this game, it's the same.  The game is fluid. I've had a city with almost 100k residents and no lag moving around the city and taking care of things. the game is a bit more challenging though...don't have the right balance of services and your city and you'll crap out.   the flaws of this game: * As mentioned, if you don't have the right balance of things your city will fail, and fast. While laying new subway lines for my CBD my population went from around 15k to around 5k. Turns out that portion of my city randomly died, and fast. I then discovered that I had a minor traffic jam in which ambulances were waiting for a red light! One of the major flaws of the game: The emergancy services don't ignore the traffic lights when they're responding to calls - this makes major problems if you have a minor traffic jam, your ambulences are stuck waiting in it and your citizens die. * More onto the above point, if you have a well established public transportation system, 90% of the vehicles on your roadway are AMBULENCES! This is SO annoying. If you need to get precise, no matter where you zoom, you hear the sirens! EVERYONE in your city will call 911 if they have a bloody nose it seems! THIS IS SO ANNOYING. * The landfills have to be placed in the midst of your city, you can't just shove them off in one corner and have your garbage trucks carry the garbage all that way. This is a major problem as the landfills cause ground pollution. Probably not that badly as an incinerator, but with ground pollution near to your residents they'll get sick. * The onramps/offramps look a bit weird and are hard to manage, same with the curves of the roads. Not a game breaker though.  All in all, I definitely recommend you get this game. It's fantastic, and with a HUGE modding community already going, it'll only get better.",

I've only played 18 Hours of it so far and in that time I've roamed around Los Santos from GTA 5, Venice, France, UK and Gotham. I've ruined two worlds by accidentally polluting the water and putting thousands of people in hospital running up my debt and now finally after those 18 hours I've finally got the hang of the game and I'm now safely running a 30k pop world and rising.   PROs - Higher learning curve required over SM - In-depth tax, resource management, budget system - Mods - Large Landscape - Custom Maps  CONs - No autosave feature - Mods disable achievements - Manual Bulldozer  Possible future patches could include the cons listed. An autosave feature would be a godsend, every so often my PC decides to randomly cut off for no reason and if I haven't sayed for quite some time, that's a huge chunk of my time wasted as I'll have to do it all over again. Some mods actually benefit the game without deteriorating from the experience (unlimited cash) such as a the autosave mod. Having to manually click each indivual road or house item can over time become tedious, automating this like the Bulldozer in SM would be beneficial",

            "review_text": "Alright, after 11 hours in this game I'm still only scraping the surface really but so far, in my opinion this game is everything SimCity should have been.  The gameplay is fun, if you like city builders of course, and figuring out what method works best to lure in those citizens is making the game into a sort of crack to me. It's one of those games you can't put down once you start playing, while Civilization has it's 'Just one more turn' this game has 'Just 5 more minutes' or 'I'll quit, I just have to get this road straight... what, it's an hour later now?'  The fact that it's also Steam Workshop enabled promises that there'll always be fun new things to build in your city.  I'm not sure how big the area you can build on eventually will become but so far I can buy 8+ new areas, just as big as the one you start with, which I think is bigger than the full area you have in SimCity.  My only complaint is that it's a bit hard to get the traffic to flow properly. It seems no matter what I do I just push the issue further down the road. Roundabouts help a lot, but the two you have access to are waaaay to big. A single one lane roundabout to keep the traffic flowing rather than getting stuck at traffic lights would be great, then again, there might be one available sooner or later thanks to Steam workshop.  Scores for those that desperately need them:  Graphics: 6/10 - The game could use some more varying buildings so you don't end up with the same three or four buildings repeated over and over. Sound: 7/10 - Music is nice and adds some ambience, which is all that is needed in a game like this. Gameplay: 9/10 - Like crack. Only legal and slightly less harmful to your health and social life. Overall: 7/10 - A really fun game so far with the potential to become even better.",

            "review_text": "A real return to city building greatness.   I approached Cites:Skylines with a small amount of trepidation, I have already been burnt by the disappointment that was the most recent Sim City.   However Cities:Skylines is no Sim City clone. Rather it takes a lot of the best elements of the Sim City franchise, and puts them into a very a slick, playable and user friendly package. The game is friendly to a new user, introducing new elements and features over time in a gated sense, but don't be mistaken it isn't impossible to fail, on my very first city I managed to bankrupt myself before I had proper infrastructure or even a few buildings because of my complex and excessively ambitious waste management and water system. From the get go there is a lot to do providing an engaging experience, but not so much as to overwhelm. There is enough detail and content to introduce the newer player gradually whilst simultaneously allowing players with more experience new ways to improve and experiment.   You start off small, with a few roads and your very most basic amenities and infrastructure for water and electricity. You attract a few hundred people, build a school, and start expanding your commercial center. Before you know it you are the mayor of a town of 50,000, rebuilding motorways, managing 6 lane roundabouts and trying to build a spaghetti roller-coaster of a highway junction to alleviate excessive congestion as traffic pours into your Metropolis to visit your colossal skyscrapers. It is a very satisfying experience, through your own strategy and planning you have turned a small dull field with a few small houses into a buzzing, noisy city with a real character of your own choosing.   Despite how enjoyable the game has been so far in the short term, my most considerable worry going into the future is the potential lack of replay value. You build your infrastructure , you grow your city, you put amenities and services. The play pattern every game is pretty much identical, and there are very few randomly generated elements to change this. Combined with the lack of multiplayer capability really begs the question what will keep players coming back for more. However this is certainly somewhat alleviated by the games innate modability and interaction with the steam workshop, which seems to add a lot of capability and even quality of life fixes to the game.   This game has such a low price-tag that you could easily get your value for money in a few play throughs, and even if you do get burnt out there is not much to lose. The game also has all of the appropriate attributes to evolve and grow with the release of DLC and steam workshop content, making it a really appealing prospect to come back to when you feel like a spending your time building a city.  The game is fairly slow tempo by design, this shouldn't be a surprise it's being a city builder not Call of Duty. If slower simulation games (Civilization, city management games, Rome Total War etc) are not to you preference then I can't really suggest this will do much to change that. It's a great game for relaxing, and thinking, but its not high tempo competitive nor challenging game. Though that does not mean it isn't engaging, there is always something to do and things ever changing as you grow your city, it always keeps the player considering of ways to improve/diversify or grow the city.  The lack of multiplayer is a missed opportunity. Had the game had similar multiplayer functionality to the most recent Sim City, such as if there was some way of building concurrent cities that would evolve and change depending on a friend''s decisions in real time would have made for an even more complete experience. At the very least better functionality in terms of sharing cities and visiting cities created by friends would add a lot discussion and interaction, but I imagine these features are possibilities for the future, the game itself is a great platform which could be easily extended to a mutliplayer experience which I feel would round off the experience and add significant longevity.

The Natural Disasters DLC is the right direction, but it costs too much and should be part of the base game in my opinion.  I think multiplayer of a limited type should be considered as well, such as having neighbor cities that your roads/airports/trains are connected. That would add a challenge, because your neighbors may be farmers, office workers, etc. and you'd have to plan imports/exports accordingly. Being able to view and chat with neighbors would make the game social as well, because right now it can be a bit boring after 50 hours in your city all alone. :)",

Collossal Order is still developing DLC for the game with the intent of making the main mechanics free downloads and the paid DLC big extensions. There are tons of mods available (and I mean tons) to plug the gaps that CO left for us to build on (nice way of saying missed).  The maps are huge, this is the way Sim City should have been. If you even have a slight leaning towards city simulation games, stop thinking, reward yourself and buy this game.  Besides CO are Finnish, and Finnish are nice humble people, and boy do they know their subject matter. Its nice to know that there are ethical developers out there still and I like to reward developers like that who make a game the way gamers want it.  UPDATE: While the DLC has been rather ho hum, with such great mods, you can't half blame the developers if they have difficulty finding new things to add. That said, I think they have plenty of space to go, such as being able to edit lanes on a road? Huh CO? Please?  BTW the game is still excellent. Still pouring hours into this thing, especially with the awesome new mods that come out everyday.",

This does make things a bit trickier, but overall that is much more fun. Similarly, the mechanics of district zoning is something I hadn't expected, but turns out to be really useful. Things do tend to get a bit hectic when you end up with a large population [&gt;100,000], but that may just be due to my own lack of experience.  The audio graphical design to this game are really good. It makes it a joy to just sink in to playing for hours. From a wide angle view of the environment, right down to the models of buildings and vehicles it all looks and sounds great. The interface isn't overly complex or cluttered, and it is easy to learn.   The modding community to this game is amazing as well, with loads of great content. The devs are even taking hints from various popular mods and integrating relevant additions into the game itself, which is always nice to see. That, and the few gripes I do have about the game [like no tree brushes] can easily be fixed by a mod. They install easily, and I haven't had any game breakages from them.

It also has a 'districting' feature that helps name neighbourhoods and set special rules for different parts of town, which is a nice touch.  Zonable land is indicated next to access streets, and since it still has to be broken into squares for the game engine, it gets a bit wonky on hills, curves, and acute intersections.

Conceptually, the game is a bliss. Most things are inherently understood by the player or well summarized by their popup explanations. Still, an advanced in-game tutorial for certain things would have been appreciated (albeit you can see the wiki from the main menu). Most importantly, none of the BS from the more recent iteration of Sim City is to be found. Example: instead of paid DLC for nicer looking structures (and feeling as if you were shortchanged with an incomplete game to start with), they come free of charge. And if you ever felt there weren't enough models, you can either make them yourself or find some on the Workshop. It also looks like tons of people like to share their models on Workshop.   Despite certain shortcomings (the Tweeter feed isn't always very useful, the soundtrack could be expanded somewhat, rivers and water in general is somewhat lackluster), this game made me believe in the city sim genre once again.

This game has an unbelievable potential for creativity and making each and every city unique. Road customization is, by far, the greatest achievement of this game's developers.

Transportation options and variability is what makes or break a city sim game and this game does not let down at all.   I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys sim games.

This does make things a bit trickier, but overall that is much more fun. Similarly, the mechanics of district zoning is something I hadn't expected, but turns out to be really useful. Things do tend to get a bit hectic when you end up with a large population [&gt;100,000], but that may just be due to my own lack of experience.  The audio graphical design to this game are really good. It makes it a joy to just sink in to playing for hours. From a wide angle view of the environment, right down to the models of buildings and vehicles it all looks and sounds great. The interface isn't overly complex or cluttered, and it is easy to learn.   The modding community to this game is amazing as well, with loads of great content. The devs are even taking hints from various popular mods and integrating relevant additions into the game itself, which is always nice to see. That, and the few gripes I do have about the game [like no tree brushes] can easily be fixed by a mod. They install easily, and I haven't had any game breakages from them.

FX6300 @ 3.5 Ghz GTX 760 2GB OC'd 8 GB RAM  Hopefully they will improve performance in the future, but it's perfectly playable on my computer, and dropping it down to low-medium keeps it at a solid 60 fps.  Update (10/26/2015): It seems like there has been some performance improvment, as I can now keep it above 30 fps on a city of 100,000 on max settings while before it was dropping below 20 if I did not reduce graphical settings. A city of 20,000 now stays close to 60, even on max settings.",

I Love my city builders ever since simcity 4, then simcity 2013 got released and i was let down big time. then came cities xl wow !!! what a mess of a game that was, i was truly losing faith in city builders since focus home interactive were obviously run by wild monkeys who should just stop now and give up in the gaming industry.   But then the day came when cities: Skylines was released and yes i did have my doubts since i have been burnt before. but after purchasing and downloading it, i pressed play and something magical happened it didnt crash, in excitement i quickly drew out roads and placed resedentials and commercials and industrials and laid down power and water and to my amazement my city was coming to life smoothly, beautifully and with ease.  Graphics Are Great, NO LAG !! NO LAG WOOHOO,  Game Is Amazingly Put Together. The is so much to do and its filled with pure gameplay !!

It's a strategic balance of managing residential, industrial and commercial sectors whilst ensuring power and water is provided to all of your citizens. On top of this you need to ensure traffic is well managed, utilising taxi services and bus routes. You unlock greater upgrades to your public services as your population increases and certain buildings provide bonuses to the residences around them, making them upgrade and thus improving the quality of your city.   It's fun to merely marvel at what you've created, from hamlet to bustling metropolis, it's always interesting to see your city expand in accordance with your design. Whether this design is efficient or problematic will be entirely up to how every individual decision was made. Aesthetically the game is simple, yet pleasing and I've yet to see any performance issues. It's especially shocking to see a game made in unity completely trump a triple A production like SimCity. If you're into city management sims, you can't really do better than Cities Skylines. The only issue I have with Cities Skylines is the same issue I have with other city simulators, and that's the fact that eventually the gameplay does grow rather repetitive, with you constantly balancing the aforementioned residential, industrial and commercial sectors. Each time you meet the demand for one sector, the others will grow in demand, meaning it comes down to managing these three sectors whilst ensuring they are hooked up with power and water. That's a minor complaint though, as it's pretty much the standard for any city sim and more of a personal gripe.",

This game is a blast. I'm not a person who ever really enjoys the city-building genre but this one is drawing me into it. The game sort of has a 'one more turn' mentality like in Civilizations 5. There's always expansion to do, things to build in the city, and constant improving. This game has quite a bit of depth that will keep you preoccupied. It's fun to watch your suburbs grow as you add more to it; and eventually see your Downtown commercial district upgrade itself from good services and happiness. Then finally be able to add skyscrapers.  Traffic management is a large part of the game. Roads don't have simple little animations. They're actual individual people who have a place to go to, and place to come back to. Such as the trucks that are always importing things to your factories and exporting. It's sort of like watching your city's economy come to life. If cargo trucks are unable to supply your commercial stores and factories, well they won't make money and will probably go out of business. Then you will have an abandoned building that will lower the land value of the area around it. Until it is reclaimed or you manually demolish it.  I enjoy watching cars using the highway system I've created. Then later on I find out I should make a few tweaks and it becomes so much the better.  The only gripe I would have is the bus system, for the current version 1.06b . In my city I probably should cut down on the amount of bus lines, since the game spawns dozens upon dozens of them and it clogs traffic quite a bit. Laying down bus stops and lines itself seems a bit messy and it can be hard to tell how effective it will be.  ",

They gave us the city building game that Sim City 2013 should have been... but better.  It's sleek, it's beautiful, it's full of life, it's fully moddable, it's BIG, and last but definitely NOT the least you don't have to be logged into some server to even play the game.

Its a solid take a a city simulator though if youre after achievements expect to spend money for dlc. no fun with friends, but is kids safe  So some tips: Take your time. Take space on the map for road upgrades; mind where you put city services or parks so they dont affect road upgrades &amp; dont cluster intersections. You always want some unemployment, to do so always have your green residential demand low, keep blue commercial and orange industrial never full but never empty, but more demand the better.  Residential areas need parks for happiness and industrial needs firestations. To see how traffic is in the city, choose a road type and on the keyboard pg down like you would for a tunnel to see the density or congestion.",

This leads to a dangerous,amazingly fun,beast of a game,dangerous because it is so addictive that you can lose hours of your life at a time without really ever noticing,this is definetly a game that is worth the price you pay.Although for your own sake try and use some self resraint in the amount of time you pour into this game,but that's just some friendly advice,and in the end I am sure I will end up with hundreds of hours into this game.

That being said, this city building game is probably one of the simplest complex games i've ever played. Granted that I have yet to play it to an advanced stage, I find the overall gameplay to be quite simple. Literally the only thing you need to worry about for a large portion of the start is laying down some roads and zoning areas next to the roads. The game does the rest. It might as well be called urban planning simulator, but I suppose you can't have urban planning without a city.   Just get this game, draw some roads and zone some areas. It is a delight to see the city come to life before your eyes. The good thing about this game is that it will get you thinking about good urban layouts. Soon you will be questioning certain design choices in your very own real live city. Maybe even take inpiration from the city in which you live to the city you are building in Cities Skylines.",

You play as the mayor of your very own city, which you can build and shape to your will, trying to keep up with your citizens demands for water, power, facilities, space, etc. whilst also trying to turn a profit.  When stuff goes wrong, you're in debt, your citizens are unhappy and moaning about the fact that there are power cuts and too much traffic, it's pretty infuriating. I found myself shouting at my monitor 'SHUT UP ABOUT THE F**KING CRIME RATE' a fair few times. But when everything's going good, your citizens are happy, people are moving in and you're turning a profit, it's a great feeling. Knowing that you're doing something right, that you're building something good from scratch, is marvellous.  Visually, it's stunning. Zooming right in to see all the little people running around, the cars whizzing around the streets, lights turning on and off as the days go by, is pretty nice. The musical score is fantasic, too, lots of music that really makes you feel like you're the one in charge and you're the one running the show.  And the mod support? Oh, the mod support! It's so great to be able to want a feature in the game, head to the Steam Workshop, and click Add. The modding community is amazing, there are so many resources to be had so easily.  So, conclusion time. Should you buy Cities Skylines? Yes, you probably should. If you want an easy game that'll reward you for doing basically nothing, look elsewhere. But if you want a fun challenge that will reward you massively for your patience and ability to plan ahead, look no further. It's not exciting in the CSGO-last-person-on-my-team-must-defuse-the-bomb sense, but it's exhilerating in it's own, unique way. It's the best city building sim out there, and a damn good game to boot.",

It is better than Sim City and solves a lot of its problems but at the same time it has its own issues.

Cons: Some buildings are way overweight positive benefits some way too low.(example cremation with 7 vehichles way to puny and really guys a 160 MW solar powerplant the size of two highshools..what kind of treehugging world do we live in here) No multiplayer/Leaderboards so no competiviness. At $30 slightly overpriced. Would consider this a mid 20 to 20 dollar game. Small irks (abandoned buildings, resource spottiness, no futuristic buildings to unlock late game)  Overall this game is very much a step in the right direction of how a city simulation game should be. Still by far not a trend setting game as its hyped to be. More of a repolished version of simcity 3000. Would love to see more inovative ideas in the game future tech, new transport, just new stuff in general. Developers by all means keep the stuff that we love in the game, DON'T YOU DARE TOUCH IT, but stop being so scared to add new stuff at the sake of angering fans. Give us new stuff to love. ",

            "review_text": "Cities: Skylines Review:  I wrote down what my reaction was to each day I had the game up until the release date (March 10).  Day 1(March 4th)(I received the game at about 9:00 PM EST, but failed to check my email, I checked my email at about 11:00 PM EST and immediately downloaded the game)  As I opened the game it completely lost me in its blue color. I immediately started playing, I couldn't wait another second. I started my first city. As I look at the roads I notice that the only road I have unlocked is a 2way road. That made me confused. Why would I place a road just to delete it? What I mean is that I placed it on the highway ramps to come into/leave the city. As I place the 1 way 2 lane roads I think, 'Where do I start'? As I start to plan my city, my friend home rings, it is right next to me, completely ignore it. I could not move away. I played for about an hour before realizing I need to go to bed.  Day 2(March 5th) I wake up at about 5:30 to 6:00 AM EST. I hurry to get myself ready, I'm about 25 minutes early than I usually am. What did I do? What do you think I did? I hopped back on Cities: Skylines. I played for about 20 minutes only to realize that I had to part from my computer. Once I came home I played for about 3:00 PM EST to 1:00 AM EST(10 hours) before going to bed.  Day 3(March 6th) Played from about 7:00 AM EST to 1:00 AM EST. I could not stop playing! Built my city up and thought that I should start a new one. Started 'Stockholm'.   Day 4(March 7th) I didn't get much playing time in, only about an hour total.   Day 5(March 8th) Played about 10:00 AM EST to 11:00 AM EST and about 5:30 PM EST to 1:00 AM EST  Day 6(March 9th) Played a little. Maybe about 2 hours.   As of this writing, I have played this game for 35.1 hours. So almost 1.5 days in 6 days. Wow. This game is great.  Pros: The detail. The fact you can see 'poop water' floating away is great. The water dynamics are really really good. The fact that you can run a small farm town instead of building up to a huge city is really really cool. Running a small farm town is great.  Cons: Game doesn't run great on laptops, especially huge cities. Traffic is a little too congested on the graphs. What I mean is if you use the traffic info view traffic on a road/intersection is weighed to heavily towards the red. Traffic is a huge issue.  Rank: 8/10  Side effects of playing: Addiction Have an extremely fun time creating the city of your dreams",

            "review_text": "I want to start off by firstly saying if you are expecting a 'OMFG BEST CITY BUILDA GAME EVA!!!!!!!' post, then you'll be disappointed. Don't get me wrong, Skylines is a great game, but I would not call it the best city builder ever.  To be able to do that, we would have to compare how Skylines is against its two main rivals, SimCity 2013 (EA) and Cities XXL (FHI). It is my opinion that all three games are good games that stand on their own feet. Okay, SimCity 2013 only has one foot, and a severely disabled one at that, but it does bring some good to the genre.  Take for instance, modular service buildings in SC2013. These were pretty ace! Expand a service building over time as the neighborhood grew and required more/additional services. SC2013 also carried over the fantastic Rush Hour concept from SC4. This allowed the game to really stretch your transport networks to the limits during a simulated city rush hour.  In another corner, Cities XXL brought huge lifelike maps to the genre, the ability to not just create a single city but an entire region in one encompassing map. This took SimCity 4's region view to the next level. And probably because of the regional map, XXL's rural possibilities, including rural towns and farming, are far and away the highlight of a game beset with numerous issues.  Skylines on the other hand doesn't appear to include these 3 game concepts (yet, maybe future dlc?). But Skylines brings other concepts to the genre. Districts is nothing short of a brilliant addition to the genre. Now you can specify separate districts (call them suburbs if you want) and specify city policies to specialise each district. Now you can have a timber district, oil district, heavy industry district, upper class residential district all with their own city and transport policies. The use of the Unity engine for Skylines opens up an entire plethora of modding potential in the game. Already on day 1 we can see full map unlock mods, Chirpy killer mods and many others. The potential of what modders can add to the game is nearly limitless.  But like SC2013's severely handicapped map sizes, and XXL's defunct game engine, Skylines has it's own share of issues. Chirpy has become the most hated item of the game. There is no way to turn it off without the use of a mod (which stops achievements being gained). The 9 map tile limit (out of 25) is a purely insane decision by the developers. People have already proven that due to the map not impacting CPU usage (CPU usage is impacted by population) that the story of 'oh we limited map tiles due to hardware limits' is total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. It's this person's opinion that a 25 tile unlock dlc was in the pipeline to be fed to us all for $5. But now we'll never know. That of course brings me to my next point. Paradox is famous for dlc's. Now whether you agree with the way PDX does dlc or not is irrelevant to me. Just know that Crusader Kings 2 (PDX has already openly stated that the dlc model for Skylines is the same as CK2) has 53 dlc for a cost of $185 USD. With the base game costing $40 USD still it means to get a complete CK2 you're up for $225 USD. Don't argue with me on the point, but try to justify how the 53 dlc for CK2 is the equivalent of 9 old-style $20 expansion packs.  So I suppose the bottom line is this. Cities Skylines is a good game. But I would not call it the best city builder ever. Understand that SimCity 2013, Cities XXL and Cities Skylines all have their own positives and negatives. Where one lacks, another picks up. Do I recommend you pick up Cities Skylines? Sure, but don't expect it to be the perfect game. I don't see that happening until 3 years and 50 dlc down the track.",

It's alot less complex than simcity games, and as far as traffic is concerned, much more detailed. It's the only city builder I've played where there is very little consequence for destroying huge areas of businesses or houses so you can make room for a new highway and a few dozen ramps, or whipe out half your business district so you can put in a nice train depot. It seems like new businesses will just pop right up and it doesn't cost a penalty. The biggest expense would be the roads in the above case. Want to move a $20k firehouse? There's move buttons for almost all special buildings so it only costs about 10% to scoot it over a block, or out of the way of an elevator walk-path. The day/night cycle, and now rain, gives it some nice ambience.  There are several good mods out there and tons of assets that you can subscribe to on the workshop. And though it's encouraged to do this, it will slow your computer with tons of assets, and the mods will prevent achievements from being earned, which is very annoying.  And though it feels complete, it also feels like it falls short for some reason. I think it's from a lack of real challenges. The hard mode simply raises prices 10%, but after playing a while you basically have unlimited money. And aside from population, there's no real goals in this game. There is no reason to have a huge manufacturing town or farming community. There's no tornados, riots, or even upset people for that matter. Happiness is almost always high unless you forget to give them water, or electricity. Overall I would rate this in between a thumbs up and down, but leaning towards up. 3 out of 5 star.",

Intuitive and easy to grasp. Mods give it an outstanding replay value.  Cons: Chirpie brings nothing to the game. Could use more standard buildings although mods fix that. Traffic is very hard to manage. Could use more ways to 'go green'.  Overall i really recommend this game.

The vanilla game is expansive with multiple public transport options, many different building styles, themes, cars and people. THE PEOPLE. Everyone and i mean EVERYONE has a random name, random job and random place they live in. You can follow one person to wherever they go. It makes it feel like a real city. Everyone has their own objective and place to be. Every car and pedestrian has a story.  There is so much replayablity due to the fact of ENDLESS maps on the Steam Workshop that make every city look completely different from your last. The sheer scale of everything from highways and skyscrapers makes this such an immersive experience. The only problem i have with the game is the traffic. Constant line ups of cars who REFUSE to go into multiple lanes on a highway or road gets really annoying. I am yet to find a proper solution.

Many great features, including very well done mod support, speaking of which, mods, like with Skyrim, really help the game shine where it has a deficit.  Advanced traffic management techniques are usually required especially in the late game if you don't want dead people piling up in one part of the city amongst other problems. My only real gripe is the limits with the Unity engine (From what I've read) in that my city has grown enough such that I get the 'Cannot create anymore objects of this type' so it's not possible to expand my city beyond a certain limit.   Other than that, it's a well made game that I would highly recommend to anyone who has ever played and enjoyed games akin to that of Sim City 4",

This game meets or excedes the amount of hype that was built up about it. One might even argue that due to it being exactly what it was advertised to be that it was not hype at all, but them just advertising their product honestly and plainly.   This game is a rare example of what be achieved with a bit of love for what you are doing.  Cities: Skylines is definitely not without its flaws though. In most cases those flaws could be modded out of the game and the remainder of the problems could potentially be overlooked. The game is good enough that the flaws it does have just don't really seem to be too much of a problem. That is a lot coming from someone who happens to be very critical and I am very critical of products that are up for purchase consideration.  The price is excelent for this game too. I am not one to shy away from pirating software but this game, due to its price and the amount of satisfaction I get while playing it, it is worth every penny, no doubt. No buyers remorse nor guilt. Just a good product for a good price.  Thanks to Colossal Order, today is a very good day to be a fan of the city simulation genre.  This game is truly amazing.",

            "review_text": "Cities: Skylines is a very good city builder game for anyone that doesn't want to buy DRM-city (Simcity)  Cities: Skylines is one of the best city builders I've played in a long time. To be fair, most of them were free to play and relied heavily on microtransations and timers. Recently, I've purchased this game and also the lastest Simcity game (2013). I purchased Simcity on origin and regret it to this day.  This particular game gives you alot of freedom when you compare to the disaster that was Simcity (2013). One of the main things is that you don't have to play exclusivly online which makes sense since City-Builders are singleplayer games and the multiplayer elements in Simcity weren't even that useful.  The main market for Cities:Skylines seems to be the ability to mod as you are able to create your city exactly how you want, you are able to get different design schemes for buildings or entirely new building adding new mechanics to the game.  Cities is able to run decently on most computers however, older computers will struggle when numerous entities are on the screen such as car, people, trains, etc. This is something to consider when picking up this game.  A bad thing about game is how overpriced the DLC is for the little amount of content in it. Another thing I find a bit stupid in this game is the mechanics for waterpipes and powerlines, in this right, I would say Simcity was better at this than Cities is. In simcity, the pipes are built into the road and power travels through the road. The only time you would need power lines or piping is if you have an area of town that was not connected to the main roads for some reason. This is just nitpicking though.  However in cities, you have endless possiblities and customization options with mods and level editors that should be able to fix some of these problem for you.  Overall, I would recommend this game to any who whats to build a city.  10/10",

When you get bored of the land your building you city on you can always pick a new one since there is 9 maps or you can make your own map using the map editor thingy, you can make a map where its all flat or you can make a map where there is moutains all around the map, and you can go onto the steam workshop and subscribe maps that other people made and use them, and also there is the asset editor which is a tool where you can customize buildings and more, and you can use 3D modling tools or whatever their called to make your own buildings, people have made little restruants like McDonalds and made landmarks, and you can subscribe to mods and use them to flood your city or to customize the game.

When you have a big city, all you can do is speed up the game so you have enough money to buy monuments. And that's it.  The lack of secretaries (like SimCity 4) also makes the game a bit too artificial.  But, it is still very fun, and i don't think my money was wasted because it was on sale. And, if it is on sale, and you want a new experience with a city simulator, Cities Skylines is not a bad option. But don't get fooled: It isn't the game everyone says it is. It is a fun simulator that gets boring too quickly, and that's it.  I wasn't sure if i would upvote the game or not, but, for the sake of honesty, i recommend it, if you buy it on sale. I will probably play it every now and then, but, after the initial hype, i doubt i will spend hours and hours building another city.",

I mean, I can but not the way it is sensible for a road to be split - three lanes are pushed towards each other and three lanes deviate - in real life the leftmost three lanes just continue straight ahead and the 3 lanes to the right deviate - unfortunately not in Cities Skylines. Ramps off highway are at ridiculous high angle and even if you use the sharp angle mod it is still too much. Now, that might not be a problem for a lot of players but it is just disastrous to me as the same company made CIM2 where roads are built in a lot more realistic manner. Why?! Why did you change that? :( Game for me is ruined because of this. Everything else is top 10 out of 10, really. But this nonsense, given the fact CIM2 has the perfect road system a game can have... I know, it is probably not as annoying to other players as it is to me so that is why I still recommend the game.",

The only issue I have is that I cannot seem to switch back to the American base theme which I started with instead of the European base theme. I like it, but the game is called cities: skylines, and none of the regular zoned buildings even come close to the sky in the European based theme. So that is my only complaint, but DEFINITELY buy this game. It's worth it.",

            "review_text": "This game stil has a lot of potential. While it's already a great game there are a few things that may anoy you or are just bad design choices. Basically SimCity 2.0 but a little less 'polished', and a lot of features that you wished were in it in the first place. I've only played it at the time of this reveiw for a couple of hours and can say that I do really enjoy this game.    Pros  - Runs silky smooth. Even if I unlock all 25 build squares I'm at a constant 60+FPS, will need to update this in future when I make some large cities. - Steam workshop support - 9, 2x2km^2 tiles, moddable up to 25 or 100km^2!!! - Import your own heightmaps and create your own worlds - Pretty to look at. - Takes ideas from SimCity and makes them better!   Cons  Longer list but don't worry, they're only minor issues that are easily work-roundable - User Interface Needs some serious work. Chirpy is the most anoyying AF thing by far. But it could be less anoyying and more useful if they moved it to one of the two big empty spaces in the bottom UI bar. Icons need updating. Some are slightly bland, and some are just too random to understand what they are. In-game icons or warnings above houses are very very difficult to understand or make out at times unless you click the building to find out what the problem is. A simple mouse over display would be nicer. Tutorial dialog is awful, it places dialogs infront of buttons that you need to click to access certain things. I hate having to close every single one each time. - Traffic Who knows how traffic works? Road placement is nice, but It only shows you a help grid once you start placing a road down. - Sounds In-game sounds are not the greatest. I turned my music off and set the SFX to low. Personal preference - Tutorial Not much of a tutorial, you're left to figure out a lot of stuff on your own.  There should be a tutorial world. Every time you start a new city you have to complete the set tutorial and unlock everything the same way each time. After I've done it once or twice I know what I have to do. - Limited video options Would like some better AA options.",

            "review_text": "This game was clearly designed to be the better Sim City 2013 as it has been pointed out many times before. Suffice to say that Colossal Order have succeeded in doing so. But they have gone one step beyond that and put some thought and possibly years of experience as city building gamers themselves into their product. The ability to name city districts and issue separate policies being just my favorite little thing they added.  Cities: Skylines comes with in-house mod support and integrated Steam Workshop. Only a few days after the release Steam Workshop was filling and my guess is, that this game will spawn a thriving mod scene. Publisher Paradox Interactive has shown in the past that they are quite able in maintaining their titles. Not only their (now former) flagship Europa Universalis IV receives regular updates and the occasional free DLC. My hope is that Colossal Order will follow their lead in that.  There are a few negative points though: The game suffers a bit of a lack of variation. In the early game you have very little variety in leisure building. I would like to see a bit more than parks, plazas and playgrounds. At least a early game sports park or swimming pool would have been nice. Also there is not really much of an alternative to building forestry or farming industry if you decide to go clean. While you can build offices which count as industry it would have been nice to have something like a High Tech Industry which needs highly educated workers, still produces goods and is cleaner than generic industry. Now I know that these things can – and will be, I can assure you that! – easily be fixed by a mod or two but it would have been nice to see them in the vanilla game nonetheless.  To summarize: The overwhelming amount of positive reviews here on steam alone should tell you that this games resonates with a lot of players. If you are a fan of the Sim City franchise this game is a must have.  tl;dr: Go buy this game. You will receive good value for your money.",

I avoided the new SimCity like the plague for the DRM stance and I have a really bad internet connection. Then I tried Cities in Motion and Cities XL and subsequently XXL (Big mistake) and they just didn't really feel very good to play and more to the point they weren't fun. I felt no sense of achievement as I progressed. They were overloaded with issues which I won't go into, but most importantly to me they were NOT fun. So I always had to go back to SimCity 4+Rush Hour.  Now this game I have to say is extremely easy and simple to pick up. It is extremely easy to learn and it is extremely easy to play. That does not mean though that it isn't a fully fledged meat filled City Simulator with much depth. It is all that and more. I bought it last night, downloaded it which took a good amount of time and fired it up tonight. I fully expected it to have issues and not be particularly fun as that is the experience I've come to expect from games. Boy was I wrong. It's not buggy, I haven't really encountered any issues and it is amazingly fun. It isn't even filled with the annoying SimCity issue where pretty much right off the bat once you start building your city you have to start fiddling with the budget just to get a positive cashflow. The game play is solid, extremely solid. The fact that you go through it and you actually feel a sense of progression and it isn't really that hard while still providing you with the depth and fun that I find rare in these genre's is refreshing. Ironically the only issues I've had with this game are that it crashes when I close the game, which isn't really an issue because it doesn't matter if it crashes when I've exited. Second that there isn't a proper DRM-free version of the game. I would buy this game 5 times over for a proper DRM-free (non-steam) version of this game.  If you like any sort of Simulation, (City/Economic/Sandbox/etc) then definitely pick this one up. While I haven't played the new SimCity, everything I've read and watched about it tells me that this title... is what SimCity should have been. This is SimCity done right. Minus the brand, but imo this brand should overtake Maxis/SimCity in the city building department. It is THAT good.",

It's an unfortunate truth of games today that many times, you can not launch a game for several hours due to server DRM measures. With this game, you just download it, and launch it, and maybe add a few mods. This me without a negative impression of the game right off the bat, and allowed me to get straight into the meat of this game.  The game graphically is good, but not impressive. From zoomed out, the cities seem fine, but as you zoom in, textures become less impressive. This is one of the only bad things I have to say, and considering that this game was created by a small development team, its more of a minor annoyance. Hopefully the developers or the modding community comes up with a high resolution texture pack in the next few months.  The music of the game is okay. It's not memorable, but it isn't blaring in your ears for hours to the point of annoyance. It's really just there to add some minor ambiance.  Gameplay is fun. I feel like I'm managing a city, and I have to micromanage every intersection in order to avoid crippling traffic jams. I can build my city the way I want to and not be too constrained by a small box for my city. I am a little perturbed by the way roads work when snapping together, and will often spend a lot of time working on a highway exit.  Overall, the experience has been enjoyable so far, and I look forward to many more hours of playing this game (which there will be plenty of, unlike a certain competitor that came out 2 years ago).

            "review_text": "--Initial review at 19.1 hours--  Cities: Skylines has given me a great experience so far. Simply put, it's like Sim City if a bunch of corporate wigs didn't tell the developers 'This is what people want in a city sim, and this is how we're telling you to make it'  It's well thought out, there is attention to detail, and is a welcome new addition to the city sim genre.  That being said, it isn't perfect.  Pros:  -Well thought out game mechanics -The ability to draw out districts and enact policies in both specific districts and overall city policy. -Nice attention to detail with emergency services. As a person involved in the fire service, it's nice seeing that a firetruck in game doesn't just pull up and start shooting water at the building. One or two will show up, a few firemen get out of each and either run into the building or stand near the trucks and get hoses set up, and then the water will start flowing. It's not really important overall, but it's an appreciated detail. -Diverse power grid options ranging from coal and oil to solar, two kinds of wind, and hydroelectric. The only addition to that list that I'd like to see is some form of hydrogen power source. -Makes fun of Sim City in many ways, including achievement names, base city size, and other things. -Zoning is easy and has a layer of customization to it.  Cons: -There appears to be a self-zoning bug of some sort. I have tried to dezone an area between two roads but it keeps rezoning itself to low-density commercial. -The game doesn't always provide clear feedback to what an issue is and how to resolve it. Some issues are fairly simple to trouble shoot, but currently my city is having an issue with a lack of buyers of products from my industrial buildings, but there is no industrial, commercial, or residential demand. -The game takes a bit of patience to learn. It took me five or six tries before I created a successful city. -Some of the requirements for the unique buildings are counter-productive. Some ask you to have an obsurd number of abandoned buildings present in your city or to have a certain number of sick citizens. Compared to the other requirements like having three filled cemetaries, doing well in this sector, that sector, et cetera, those requirements are backwards and the negative concequences outway the good of unlocking the unique building. It's counter intuitive. -No day-night cycle.  Suggestions: -It would be nice to see a few more types of unique buildings or a rework of the requirements to unlocking the existing ones. -After a certain amount of time has passed for you to get your city up and running, it would be nice to see the introduction of emergencies, disasters, and other events occur that you must deal with. Perhaps things from hurricanes, snowstorms, riots, to water pipes bursting and such, et cetera. It would also allow for new polcies to be added such as putting your city into a state of emergency, curfews, gun control, citizens must shovel their portion of sidewalk during snow storms (Save money, decrease happiness), and more. -Perhaps a new utility being created for the road department. Street sweepers can help reduce ground polution, roads can degrade and you'll have to spend money to keep them maintained from pot holes and such, if snowstorms are added then snowplows would be important. -Adding the homeless could be interesting. Increased crime rates in areas they squat. You could combat that by building shelters, soup kitchens, or outlawing homelessness if you're feeling particularly evil. -It would be nice if parks didn't have to be placed right along a road, so you could put a playground in the middle of a bunch of high rises and have walking paths leading to them. -Perhaps adding a mayor's office that could be upgraded to allow for certain buffs or allow citizens to come to you with city propositions, requests, and complaints.  At this point in time, I'd give this game an 8/10. It's very well made, but there's a lot of room for improvement. After a decent amount of time, there's not much residential, industrial, or commercial demand and the challenge wears off.  If you have the money to spare, I'd say that you should buy this game at it's full price or wait for a sale. ",

I saw the hype online, the 30 dollar price tag, the day one modding support, and the way the dev and publisher conducted themselves online, and it convinced me to take the plunge. I'm glad I did. The hours have melted by this sunday, and I hardly believe I just sank 8 hours in one sitting with ease. This is like discovering Simcity all over again. Its full of color, micro management, and zoning. Its all so simple, yet very complex under the surface, giving you plenty to work towards.   This is a game with difficulty as well, which I'm very happy about. I managed to kill off two cities before getting the swing of things. There are a few things I have issues with though: I'd like to see a route checking tool similar to Simcity 4's. It allowed you to see what routes your sims took to work, or shopping or what ever. It gave information on what mode of transport they took, and congestion and volume data. Cities has congestion data, but you don't get as much information as I'm used too. I guess that's my major issue, not enough data. I have no doubt that the devs will include plenty of updates and expansions in the future, many of which they have said will be free. Now that's value. I whole heartly recommend this game.",

You start out with 1 Tile of land, you must then populate that tile and once you reach certain milestones you will be able to expand to other tiles.  Each tile is unique, each tile has its own resources such as forests, agricultural land, ore, oil, water its then up to you to take use of these resources and 'specialize' the industry.   You will also have to maintain a network of water pipes, and make sure they function properly. There's also a interesting power grid that you will have to make sure is functioning properly. Next to that, you will have to maintain the infrastructure of your city which plays an enourmous role later in the game. So think twice before placing that one way road!   The graphics are extremely well for the game aswell, when you zoom in you can see a lot of the detail. There's even a first person mod, where you can walk amongst your citizens in eye-height.

I get the feeling that the developers of this game played a lot of Cities XL and Simcity 2013 and then sat down in a big group and said 'You know those really annoying and silly things those games do? Let's NOT do those.'  It's not perfect, there's some things that can be irritating, but not unbearable, and they are so vastly outweighed by the positive aspects that they don't really matter anyway. The gameplay is well balanced, with income in the early game making it a challenge to inexperienced players, but once you get the hang of designing areas and supplying them with requirements, your town will level up and you get a new set of requirements, which keeps pushing the game forward well.  The opportunity to buy new land means the Cities can reach massive sizes, though I haven't got to that sort of stage yet and can't tell you how well the game plays there, but I've had no issues with performance of the game up to this point.  All in all, a fun, engaging City-Builder with a lot of character, some nice new ideas to help you manage your city and keep your citizens happy, plenty of content and exceptional mod support that keeps that content growing.",

This kind of 'Think Tank' arrogance drove Maxis to it's grave. In the end, EA didn't get the last word. I don't know what their agenda was but let the lesson be learnt.   Colossal Order took Simcity 2013, cleaned it of it's debilitating afflictions, perfectionned it and re-released it under a new identity.  There is not much that have not been already said about the game. It's well optimized, the traffic simulation is excellent, you can make pretty big cities, there are Metros, Busses, Trains and Highways. There are districts that you can draw the limits to and add specific policies to. There is also a dynamic water simulation that is rather cool but not that impressive. The game feels like a finished and well balanced product for the price. The end product is a very decent City builder with a lot of potential. For now, I can't think of any other City builder that is as advanced or as good.  And that leads to the shortcommings.  As good as it is, it falls short on more than a few level. First of all, regarding the zoning and policies. I really like the idea of districts, but the list of policies and city rules that you can pass is very short. There is so much potential here. Why not let me ban bars in a district to reduce crime, or promote art galleries or small workshops. You can ban Hi-rise buildings but why not choose a particular architectural style? Or build commercial pedestrian only roads.   Regarding transportation, I would have loved to see Bicycle lanes. Being able to set a public biking service.  Why is there no aspect in the game regarding homelessness? And maybe adopt district policies to drive homeless people out, or to shelter them and so on. Something to give personnality to your city.  Lastly, why isn't there 'mixed' zoning? As in, comercial on the first floor, residential on the upper floors. You know, like in every big cities.   Well I guess these are my main complaints, but i'm just happy that the game is what it is right now. I completely recommend it. Let's hope some updates will bring new interesting features.   The steam page also states 'Extensive modding support' so let's see what interesting thing can be done by the community.",

One thing I think was particularly well done is the pacing of the unlocks. Everything seems to become available just as you need it, usually anyway. Little things like that show just how much playtesting was done prior to release.   Also, if you didn't already know, Paradox sent copies to a multitude of streamers before release, so they could show the game off. Really goes to show how confident they are in their game, and why they're one of the best lesser-known publishers.  Long story short, if you like city builders, god games, whatever genre label you affix to the descendants of the original Simcity - you will not be disappointed in this game.",

At a distance you can see every car, moving and parked. As you zoom in you can see each individual person. Even animals.  Click on just about anything and a box pops up with loads of information. A person will show their name, where they are headed, where they live, where they work. Vehicles tell you where they are headed, where they are from. Even animals tell what they are doing. My very first game I zoomed in and a seagull flew into my view. And I clicked on it. And it told me its name was seagull and that it was flying.  EVERYTHING IS SIMULATED. Seriously everything. I don't have quite the greatest computer (3.6ghz dual core processor, 1GB GDDR5 graphics card) but it ran perfectly all the way up to a city size of around 19,000 or so... and even then I hardly noticed the lag, only when I moved my view.  The road building is incredible. Completely free-form if you want, or more control if that's your style. One minor complaint: you can't build intersections very close together. It has a hard time putting two intersections within one section of road. (But then again that's probably for the best)  Traffic Simulation is great. As more and more roads are built and changed, the traffic changes patterns to find the fastest/best route. In my latest game I built a roundabout at the end of the highway. Trucks from the industrial area were clogging the intersection so i made an on/off ramp that bypasses the roundabout. The moment I finished building the ramps, trucks were already using it.  Two words: Water. Physics. Rivers actually flow. Build a dam and watch the water level in front of it slowly rise the entire length of the river.  All of the building tools are extremely easy to use. UI is intuitive. Sometimes lags when you try to click the bulldozer so you end up upgrading the road you wanted to demolish... but otherwise good.  Other cons I found: -Sometimes building angled or curved roads near existing buildings will change the zoning squares, deleting said buildings. -Sometimes traffic doesn't use all available lanes (But that happens in real life I suppose) -Also check out other reviews for things that don't bother me  Suggestions for devs: It would be nice if water and electricity funding showed production and usage values (rather than switching to each build panel to see if a 5% or so boost was enough)  Overall: Great Graphics Runs well even on lower level computers Simulates literally everything Water Physics If you like the genre: its a definite buy.",

With loads of different building types, zones, policies, industries, and transport avenues, there's a ton to micromanage and develope. This game will defintly keep you busy for hours.  The only drawback I found was that cities max out around 200,000 population, which isn't all that hard to reach if you plan your roads accordingly (without implementing mods). I also found it to be rather easy at times, but perhaps that's just because I think of myself as a Domestic King, but that's more of an innnerself issue I need to figure out.

They are slowly diminishing, but it was quite something to watch, even if it did require me to rebuild my highway and industry....  Building roads in this is also a dream (and possibly a nightmare if, like me, you accidentally start the game with the traffic driving one the *wrong* side of the road, thus confusing the hell out of me). You can end up with some seriously cool looking junctions and highway slip roads.   The assest editor is an added bonus. You can practice making your fancy junctions without fear you are neglecting your city. You can also build your own parks, buildings and more, that you can then use in game.   As for the game play itself? It constently keeps you wanting to play more. You aim for population levels which give you bonuses and the chance to expand, whilst juggling residential, commercial and industrial needs, building public transport and planning for future expansion, all whilst ensuring power and water are connected properly, and noise pollution is not too high. There is so much to do, and it is so engrossing, that I warn you only get it if you have the time to spare.

Now that I have well over seventy hours of game time accumulated, I'm convinced that this is one game that I'll be playing for years to come.  It has been said many times in many ways, but this really is what  SimCity 2013  should have been.  Cities  manages to capture a lot of the magic from the fantastic  SimCity 4 . I'm really enjoying the building process and am enjoying expanding with transit and larger areas. The 'district' feature is promising and the game looks great; it also runs well on my older PC. There are no doubt things that can be tweaked and improved over time, and new features to add, but this game was in great shape right from launch. I'm really impressed with how quickly and effortlessly the modding community has embraced the game and the vast array of tweaks and tricks that have been developed already.   Cities: Skylines  is definitely well worth the purchase, and it is no surprise that the game has already sold over one million copies. Just buy it!  EDIT: Two months, 100+ hours on the game, still loving it. There's a new update today. one word: TUNNELS! (Oh yes, Euro-style buildings, bug fixes, great dev support - did I mention the tunnels?)",

It's very easy to start up a city and to start understanding the basics, and I've suffered the 'Civilization' effect several times, thinking I'd been playing an hour when I'd actually been staring at the screen, following traffic patterns for 3 hours.   The Steam Workshop support really elevates this to a higher level. You can find everything from McDonalds to the Better Call Saul billboard to the freaking Death Star in there, and add it to your game in a click. There are also numerous mods that can change everything. The Workshop support alone makes this one worth playing if you're a fan of the genre.   HOWEVER, as fun as it is, this one's extremely traffic dependant. You have to really work to make sure your traffic flows properly. And as I said above....garbage. My god, my cities and their garbage. Your trucks won't go where you want them. The landfill will be full before you realize it's even close to being so. Emptying the landfill takes hours of real-life time, and you can only do so if you have another garbage facility to move it to. It's almost like a statement about the wastefulness of our species or something, and while I appreciate the 'sim' side of the game, the garbage mechanic does detract from the fun somewhat. There are mods that can help with it, but they block acheivements. Once I master garbage, I'll master the game. I'm sure of it.   If you ever played Simcity, Simcity 2000, Simcity 3000, or Simcity 4 and want something to bring back that magic...pick this one up. It's worth every penny.",

Cities Skylines is the best cities sim game i have ever played, of course there are some issues but the pros far outweigh the cons.  Some things that stand out to me: - First the zoning is such a great tool, paint along the roads and the building type get built, its quick, easy, and a huge time saver. - Each sim you see has his own path, his own job, house, car, and you can click on him and watch him go through the city. - The unique buildings. - The way they set up the traffic so you will get traffic jams but they will only get so out of hand as to not gridlock the entire city.  A few things that could be changed: -There is no night cycles so the traffic is always steady. It would be nice to have rush hours and slow times. - The budgeting is good but it would be nice to be able to budget each building seperately. - Mass transit is a little confusing when you get more than 3 seperate lines. - The building skins repeat ALOT. - Some of the messages from buildings ie: To few services, are to vague.  If you havent bought this game, what are you waiting for?  Fantastic game!  Now back for another 12 hours!   ",

At this point, I am well into the game and its myriad of mods and features. The obvious point of comparison remains the (somewhat failed) reboot of the SimCity, for better or for worse.  Both games remain focused on the RCI indicator, a series of bars indicating the rise and fall of demand for development of Residiential, Commercial, and Industrial zones. However, Cities: Skylines is at heart a traffic simulator, unsurprising when one considers the history of the software company. I believe that the original SimCity that came out when I was a kid was simularly a traffic simulator, in much the same way that another Maxis gem, SimTower, was an elevator simulator. However, players will notice that much more attention has been paid to the traffic simulation than to other areas of the game.  Where SimCity focused on a sense of 'progress' and 'rewards,' while always dangling the carrot of a destructive God-Mode, Cities: Skylines is much more laidback. If you want to destroy your city, you'll have more success taking the route of the insane mayor than the path of some prehistoric demon-lord. Cities:Skylines offers no insta-volcanoes, robot-attacks, or click-and-drag tornadoes -- instead, you could remove the sewage treatment from your city. Or remove the roads connecting your town with the outside world. Or destroy the power plant.  The effectiveness of such mundane 'disasters' showcases the strength of Cities: Skylines -- interconnectedness. The game is about the tiny changes that constantly occur, with or without your input. Whatever you did to fix that last problem will lie dormant for a week, or a month, or a year. But that quick-fix is going to come back, in a big way. For example: because you needed to increase the traffic capacity for your industrial zones, you built a hastily surveyed hiway connecting your city borders to your job-creators. Some years later, that well-meaning traffic fix is creating all kinds of havoc, keeping your trucks from using the lovely rail/super-hiway ring-system around your city.  And that's a problem more easily solved than most!",

The gameplay is well balanced, with income in the early game making it a challenge to inexperienced players, but once you get the hang of designing areas and supplying them with requirements, your town will level up and you get a new set of requirements, which keeps pushing the game forward well.  The opportunity to buy new land means the Cities can reach massive sizes, though I haven't got to that sort of stage yet and can't tell you how well the game plays there, but I've had no issues with performance of the game up to this point.  All in all, a fun, engaging City-Builder with a lot of character, some nice new ideas to help you manage your city and keep your citizens happy, plenty of content and exceptional mod support that keeps that content growing.",

            "review_text": "Edit : After playing over 30 hours now, I've discovered a flaw that eventually breaks the game. 'Death waves' as they are apparently known, are a problem as soon as you get over about 30k people, but when you get nearer to 100k, they can cause massive drops in population, that aren't recovered before the next one hits, inevitably crushing your economy. I had one earlier today (10/10 2015) that resulted in a population drop of over 40k in about 30 minutes. It was rediculous, and its ruining the fun of the game. Currently there are no mods that seem to actually solve the problem. This game was a 10/10 for me. But after dealing with repeated, city crippling death waves, I would rate this game a 7/10. Still a great game, but this is a terrible design flaw.  /// End edit ///   This is the game I've been waiting for since SimCity 4. SimCity 4 has served me very well for many years, but finally, I think I can put it to rest and move forward to a new city builder. It's not perfect by any means, no game ever is. But this game is essentially everything I wanted Simcity (2013) to be. Everything it should have been.  I've put 15 hours in it so far, in a very short time. And if I wasn't so tired right now, I'd be putting even more into it. Many of the road building options are things I longed for in Simcity, like being able to custimize interchanges (down to making one exit and over pass and the other a tunnel) make roads into tunnels where ever I want.   Earlier I had a death wave, which nearly crushed my economy, and it really shook things up for a bit while I tried to stabilize everything. And with the ability to do almost what ever I want with the highways and roads, left me spending around an hour just trying to figure out a bypass/on/offramp system to free traffic up in an area I'd devoloped too heavily. I wound up with 2 off ramps to different roads, and 2 tunnels bypassing the whole area. And I had a blast doing it.  Obviously, compared to simcity 4 with 10 years worth of mods, its a little light on content. but what it does have is excellent and enjoyable. So if you've burnt out on SC4, but don't want to build tiny 'cities' on SC(2013), this is the game for you.  It also has a huge amount of mods already out there, so I don't think it will be behind SC4 in that department for long.",

            "review_text": "I am,  by no means , a veteran of city-building games.  My cities are messy. My citizens are undoubtedly confused. I slap down zones and buildings based on wants, not needs. My compulsion to draw symmetrically is a handicap. I cannot get those accursed hydro plants to work. My mind cannot comprehend the criteria for unlocking certain buildings.  I am,  by all means , enthralled by Cities: Skylines.  =-= =-= =-= =-= =-= =-=  It is a rare ocassion when a game will allow even the most clueless of players to succeed. I suspect that it would be safe to assume that most of Skylines' current players have at least some background with other city-builders, whether it be with the classic SimCity titles, the not-so-classic SimCity 2013 or more modern examples like Cities X(X)L.  My own glancing knowledge of SimCity 2000, 3000 and 2013 will have certainly helped with the transition into Skylines, but it still felt like an entirely new experience. However, the game does extremely well in explaining its mechanics and guiding an unskilled hand, providing tutorial messages and prompts only when relevant.  Cities: Skylines assumes nothing of you, short of some common sense and logical thinking. Put yourself in the shoes of your citiy's citizens. Where do they need to go? How can they get there? What do they need to live comfortably (or uncomfortably, as it may be)? Whatever your solution, it's likely that the game will allow you to execute it. With that said, the core mechanics are not particularly difficult to understand.  Skylines, for the most part, follows the formula established by SimCity 3000 and onwards. Build roads, place zones, construct utilities, and you're pretty much good to go. As your city grows, throw in education, police, firefighters and dealing with land values to develop further. Soon after, you're dealing with public transportation, taxes, extra policies and perhaps working towards the lofty goal of building a wonder-like monument.  All of this may sound slightly intimidating to newcomers, but Skylines never forces you to approach the game with all of these things in mind. It allows you to do whatever you want, provided you have the funds to do to (there is a built-in money cheat you can use if you want). Certainly, the game will prod you with brief messages to bring matters to your attention, but you're under no obligation to do anything that it tells you to in order to build a working city.  My time with this game, a paltry eight hours as of writing, is exponentially less than other reviewers, but I can safely tell you that Cities: Skylines is not something that you will regret playing, assuming you have any interest at all in the genre. There are still numerous aspects that I am yet to discover and play with, but that really only adds to the desire to keep going.  =-= =-= =-= =-= =-= =-=  Note: Skylines is famous for its modding support, but I am yet to explore the possibilities. Therefore, it has not factored into my opinion.",

You're able to freely select different areas of your choosing, and set them as districts. With each district, you can control their own policies and laws. Ever wanted to legalize recreational drug use? You can totally do that. if that's not your thing, maybe you wish to provide free smoke detectors? Each policy comes with it's own benefits and maybe even some slight drawbacks. A great addition that keeps your city running exactly how you want it.   A very wonderful feature of Skylines is the support of mods. The game's Steam Workshop already has a slew of custom things for download. Buildings, parks, roads...you name it, and the workshop likely has it. Expect a whole bunch more user-created content as days go by! It doesn't stop as just physical items, either. Mods like camera controls with more freedom, better tree placement tools, getting rid of the Twitter-esque ticker known as 'Chirpy', auto-save, color filters...the list goes on. Tweak your game like crazy!  Still not sure? Not interested in actually managing expenses and unlocking content as you play? Colossal Order has you covered. The game comes pre-equipped with a few mods made by the devs. Two of them letting you play as a full sandbox mode, being 'Unlimited Money' and 'All Unlocks.' But perhaps you're more of a go-getter, and desire challenge. They have a 'Hard Mode' mod as well! Everything is more expensive, so keep your finances strong!   There's just so much more I'd love to say and continue to gush, but I'm getting the itch to go back and play more! For $30, you're getting way more than your money's worth. With outstanding mod support, the replayability is unlimited. Oh, did I mention there's also a map editor for making your own regions, too? Because there totally is. Go make a city based on your a real city, or around a (inactive) volcano!   Bottom line, this game seriously rocks. Why are you still here? Go click the 'Add to Cart' button, already.    ",

The base game is ok but the real winner is the modding community. Bloody Fantastic is an understatement. Every asset and mod you could ever need or think of is there. This game has great support and a well designed base platform. The game can sometimes get a bit repetitive and boring once your city is like 400+ thousand of people. Then all you mostly do is keep everything balanced especially the traffic problems. Still though this game could even trump the mighty Simcity 4000 and is mightely superior over the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ simcity 5 (2013) . Overall a fantastic game. 10/10",

When you first start if you don't know what you're doing it can be dificult, the tutorial messages didn't do much to help either. When you first start, definetly lower the spending on water and electricity in economy otherwise you will quickly go bankrupt. Also on another starting note, you can connect your waste and water pipes... I may be stupid, but I couldn't figure that out...  When I first started playing I noticed I didn't have much space to build in and that worried me. However as I played on further I found out you will be able to buy A LOT more space. Scroll the map out as far as you can at the beginning, for the most part if you can see it you will be able to buy it. NOw I don't think I need to explain how a city builder works, so I'll just quickly list off some key features. Their are multiple types of industry that you can use, multiple energy options, several different mode of stranportation, the ability to set and tax specific zones, cemetaries and creamatoriums (basic I know, but I found that cool), free range to edit your budget on everything specificaly, special building and monuments, and probably a lot more I'm forgeting. This game is well worth the $30 price tag if you love city managment sims and if its on sale, well you just got your self a great deal.",

I have never played a Sims game so I can't compare Cities to that series. However, I did grow up playing the Roller Coaster Tycoon series and to me this game is very reminiscent of that.  The steam workshop in this game really helps with the longevity of the game. It keeps things fresh and really allows you to personalize your city.  The only issues that I have ever had are:   1. The game can be confusing to new players, the lack of instruction is almost as if CO expects you to have played the first Cities game.  However, guides can very easily be found on Youtube as well as right here on Steam.  2. The extremely long load times when your city starts to get up in the 80,000+ range in terms of population.  However, it's expected since the city at that point is fairly large, and whatever you have placed in the world from the workshop only makes the load times longer.   3. Corrupt maps when you delete some buildings/monuments from your world that you have downloaded from the workshop.  This is less of a problem for me now, when the game first came out it was a big issue and I have recently found myself being able to go back to my corrupt maps and begin rebuilding! Huge ++  4. The frame drop in larger cities is almost unbearable.  Again, this is expected since it can be very crowded in some places. It's a personal issue for me since I have a habit of building metropoleis full of workshop skyscrapers. I'm sure the problem would be at least a little less noticeable in cities that are more spread out.  All in all, I think this game is well worth whatever price you happen to find it at. I haven't purchased the After Dark DLC yet, but I do plan to do so now that I am getting back into this game with my old cities functioning properly again!",

            "review_text": "GREAT city-cuilder. They nailed it.  In this game full of rich landscape visuals and charming music, you get to build the cities of your dreams. Really, there is so much freedom in this game, you can do almost anything you can imagine, reasonably speaking. The in-game toolset is very easy to learn. The interface is a bit tricky. They put some buttons right on the edge of the screen, and it is difficult to click them without edge-scrolling away from where you are working. If you are on a mac and have hotspots setup, its even worse. The people are quite easy to keep happy and the money is not difficult to make. I would probably say 9/10 of the challenge in this game is in planning your city infrastructure. You may get a city setup and get 10k people moving it and think you've done a good job, and then you get traffic jams, and businesses start abandoning the city because nobody is getting to work, and garbage piles up because the children are not getting to school, and then everyon gets sick, and the hospitals get over-crowded, and crime goes up because nobody has a job, and your whole world falls apart, all because you didn't plan ahead when you build that intersection in the middle of town. It may sound frustrating, but actually even failures are quite fun.  The default maps are mostly really lame, but the game includes a fully featured map editor so you can build your own, or play on a map made by someone else on the workshop. The map editor is a bit anoying because of how the volume and behavior of the water is simulated. Rivers are kind of a big deal in this game and to make one, you can't just cut a trench in the ground and fill it with water and decide which direction it should flow, you have to actually create an inlet where the water will come from, and wait for the simulation to push all the water around so that the river actually moves. I let the simulation run for about 1.5 hours on a map I made (while I worked on other parts of the map) and it still wasn't completely hammered out. But, if you make your rivers/water areas first, you can let the simulation run them while you finish up everything else.   In addition to maps, the game includes asset editors for making custom buildings, vehichles, intersection designs, etc. I couldn't figure out the building editor, but designing intersection presets is way more fun than I would have expected. The roads can be tricky to work with because of how they try to snap to everything nearby, but when done carefully, you can do some really cool stuff with it.  If you are familiar with SimCity4, you may recall having to set the budget for a facility to avoid wasting money on under-used services. One thing you will quickly notice in this game is that you set a budget for a service category rather than each facility. It can be annoying because your elementary school is over-funded while your highschool is under-funded and you only get one budget for all education services. But, it gives you more of a challenge to place facilities strategically so that they all balance out as much as possible.  There is no sort of selection-tool in the game. When you have no service category active, you can examine the status of any building by clicking on it, but when editing roads you can only make them and demolish them. There is no way to plan them out ahead of time and then let it all happen. So if you do it wrong, you just have to accept that the money you spent on that project is gone and you'll have to try again. It incentivises care and forethought, but I definately think the game would be improved with more selection-oriented controls and a way to plan construction before having the spend all your money on it.  The game has a lot of special, unlockable buildings to embelesh your city with. Some of them are neat, but some of them are silly. For example, a solar array that makes noise pollution. As if solar panels could possibly sit in the sun any quieter. Not to mention the space elevator! I suppose every city and every map must be on the earth's equator. Surely the game designers realize you can't just build a space elevator anywhere you want. But, you could look at it as things to RP with I guess. Maybe an equatorial space elevator city is what you want? Best of all though, the one thing this game does not seem to have which many others do, is frikin chruches! I finally get to build a city where the game doesn't throw some religious crap in my face every once in a while. That alone makes it that much more special.  I know this may look like a rather negative review, but it really is a good game. It is not without its hangups and I want to be fair and mention them, but I recommend it for anyone who likes city-builders and stuff like that. If you've never played a city builder and are wondering if it's worth giving it a try, this might be the perfect game to get your toes wet.",

It's nice, it's awesome, it's heavily inspired and influenced by the famous SimCity but there are still rooms for improvement. Based on the core game:  Pros: - Huge map size.  - Can play without Internet connection. - Lots of mods since day 1. - Built-in Assets and Maps Editor.  Cons (hopefully CO will fix them through future updates): - Gravel road SHOULD be the 1st to have instead of being an 'unlockable' tool.  - Base game color is a bit dull, and buildings can be very repetitive IF without mod contents. - Traffic AI is as bad as in SC2013. Cims will line up on a single lane on a multi-lane road/highway even though their next exit is 100KM away. Cims are polite drivers and no queue jumpers...and this including emergency service vehicles...lol! - No modular buildings. I personally think that SC2013 has way better building features. Think of its University building. Damn I love that! - Lack of specialized industries. It only has Oil, Ore, Forest, and Farm in general. However, while Oil and Ore are not renewable but they deplete way too fast. Who wants to setup an oil digger for only couple months worth of resources?  - Lack of detailed info on Income/Expenses. It would be great if we can know the profit and loss from goods export and tourism. - Lack of micromanagement game play.   Overall, although the base game play can be lacked of depth, it's still fun to play, it's quite relax, you don't have to really worry about money except in the very beginning, and it definitely fits your bill if all you want is to fill up a big map. The best part, mods are available since day 1, and it just keeps growing. Hopefully we will get more DLCs in the future. More specialized industries? Tourism? Casino? BIG modular theme park?   SC2013 was great when it comes to in game contents as well as its game music. My wish? SC2013 contents + Cities Skylines. That, will be perfect.",

This made me restart my city a few times.  2. Raise your tax to 11%. I know it sounds like a lot lol but this is the highest you can go without the cims complaining.  3. Lower your budget a bit. You can lower every budget panel to 75% exept power and electricity. You can keep that at 100%.  4. Do not use districts untill a much higher level or not use them at all. Using districts cost a ton of money so if you ask me, dont use them.  5. Make a lot of garbage dumps. But do not place them next to residential areas. Make them somewhat spread around your city.

They picked themselves up and produced Cities: Skylines.   This is without a doubt the new champion of city builders, and I don't think I am being too dramatic when I say they have saved the genre.

Also, it took me until I went into First Person View to relize the depth the developers put into the game. Traffics a big part, of course, the flow of traffic. But the devs went above and beyond to fine detail the suspension of vehicles going around corners. Another sweet attention to detail is the fire fighters. Yes, they show up jump out of their truck and start spraying the building.. But, the fire fighters that enter the building have on resperators and oxygen tanks.. I mean, holy ♥♥♥♥..

CitiesXL, CitiesXXL, and SimCity must be quivering in their boots (I don't think I said that right). It is absolutely amazing, and with DLC and updates frequent, You have alot to look foward to!   Now, on to the DLC.   At the time of this writing, there are 2 major DLCs, 'After Dark' and 'Snowfall'   After Dark in my oppinion is the best one. As well as an obvious day/night cycle, it adds a variaty of beauty to the game, aswell as some new features, such as leisure specialization and new unique buildings.   Snowfall could have many things improved. #1, Seasons. At the moment, there is only 2 options, you get rain, or you get snow. Even in boreal/temperate biomes there is no seasons. #2, Eternal Winter. This kinda goes with #1, but if you decide to play in a winter map, it is permanent. There is no summer. It's kinda like playing on a game where your building a city from Disney's 'Frozen.' #3, Heating. So already there is a busy network under your city. Metros, Trains, Tunnels, and Water. So who wants to spend another 5 hours putting in a city-wide heating system? But at least there are trams...   In conclusion, Cities: Skylines is still awesome and my favorite computer game! I highly reccomend this to any person who likes city simulations!

I'm not going to waste your time by talking about it is the savior we need in an era of SimCity (A game thats good enough despite the hate it gets) and Cities XXL (an outright scam, and not even that fun of a game). It is better than all those games.   It has a lot in common with SimCity, but also adopts a lot from its Cities in Motion heritage, such as districts and road design. The larger cities and greater freedom you have already make it better than SC2013, but the zoning design really exceeded my expectations. I was expecting something similar to CitiesXL, but the zoning methodology works really well, especially with non-perpendicular road designs.   One of my favorite features in the game are pathways and trails, which act as roads for pedestrians. They work really well and reduce traffic at pedestrian crossings - they also look really cool and work exactly as they are intended to.   While the game is far from perfect, I look forward to seeing the mods that others can make to improve the game, and the future updates to the game. I really enjoyed my first few hours with the game and look forward to what the game will do in the future.  As a loyal CO customer, I can tell you from firsthand experience that there will probably be ~$40 worth of $1-5 dollar DLC which add individual buildings, gameplay features, or map features. They don't really do large expansion packs, but expect a bunch of these smaller ones. Many of these may offer a gameplay advantage, but it doesn't really matter too much on single player. Additionally, they have been known to make free DLCs for the other two games, so expect some free updates in the future too.  ",

That said, this game is amazing. It's beautiful, the non-traffic mechanics are solid and easy to understand. The interface is clear and never obstructive. The tools for creating new assets are great. It can be difficult to create interesting and unique road intersections while keeping them functional, but a little practice with the road tools and it comes as easily to me as it could be. The addition of water simulation is really cool, but it only comes into practice with laying down hydroelectric dams.  The developers put in a ton of mod support (enough that someone could create a mod that maliciously affects your computer, so watch out) and they're in constant contact with the community. They're also adding new features as time goes by, so I'm really looking forward to that.  Features currently missing from the game that you might consider 'standard' include disasters, tunnels, day/night cycles, and weather. As of this review, tunnels are being added soon and disasters will probably show up eventually as well, if not modded in by someone cool before then.

Impressions A deep game, with a huge potential and a great gameplay... is that all? Not really. It's the first time since ages that I felt that little spark that brought me memories of the thousand of hours 'invested' playing on my old 386.

Don't let these minor problems deter you from getting this tho im very pleased with it still and hope many updates come to it soon.",

Same issue with the 'Chirper'. I wish it would tweet more about what city improvements are desired, and less joke tweets (which only seem to be a small handful that are frequently repeated).  Like I said, very minor quibbles. The core structure of the game and the gameplay itself are PERFECT for old SimCity fans. Traffic actually works (if you plan your infrastructure right). The UI is very user friendly. The visuals are beautiful. The 'Sims' themselves actually have real, consistent jobs and homes, rather than going to random jobs and returning to random homes.  I can't even imagine the logistical nightmare it must has been to code all of these algorithms for traffic, sim residency and job placement, combined with education levels, and a whole host of other factors.  But they did it.  Also, of course - NO ONLINE-ONLY REQUIREMENTS, NO DRACONIAN DRM, and ACTUAL LARGE CITY SIZES. Plus so much more.  Fair warning: my city has only reached about 5,500 population, so some of the issues I've described might change as the game progresses. But from what I've read, the game doesn't suddenly collapes into anarchy at higher levels.

            "review_text": "Cities: Skylines is a city building sim in the style of Sim City. For the last years, city building sims have been in a bit of decline. Monte Cristo entered into the market with their Cities series of games, which pushed the genre forwards, allowing bendy roads, non-circular radii for building effects and dynamically zoned areas. They pushed the genre forwards, but being as innovative as they are, they went bankrupt and didn't quite do it right.  Maxis, the undisputed rulers of this genre, came out with the latest SimCity which tried to respond to these developments. The result was a game that was interesting, had potential, but was seriously bugged and couldn't handle city sizes of any decent size. In doing so, Maxis undoubtedly shot themselves in the foot.  Along come Colossal Order, who don't have any experience in the genre, but did make Cities in Motion 1 and 2. Having played the second one, it's obvious that the engine they created for the CiM series is actually pretty damn good, something that could be adapted to make a proper city simulation game. Hence the, I was going to say hype, but it's more expectation. People were saying that, should they do an even passable job of adapting their engine, the game should be really good.  I've been playing it and... I can say it's truly amazing. I've managed to grow a city from nothing to 80,000 inhabitants and the games attention to detail is truly stunning. Where the game excels is the road modelling and transport. Place junctions too close to each other, fail to design a highway interchange correctly and everything comes to a grinding halt. Once that happens, city services, which use the roads, start to clog up and undertakers can't collect corpses, garbage stops being collected. Industry can't deliver, police cars can't get to crime scenes and ambulances can't get to medical emergencies. In short, everything goes very badly to hell.  Zoning is based around the roads. By placing roads, little squares show up next to them, in which it's possible to paint zones in any way you want. So, if you want a mainly residential block with corner shops, that's eminently doable. Or office areas with small commercial units tucked into them so that your office drones can grab their morning coffee, that's doable too.  Electricity is spread naturally from adjacent building to adjacent building, but power lines make a comeback. If a gap between powered areas is too wide, no electricity gets to them. The game cares about things like windspeed too, so placing green turbines is a real art form now, with areas being better or worse for wind. The whole level of detail recalls Sim City 4.  The water system is similarly filled with detail. You have water pumps that pump water from the river and sewage pipes that put waste water back in. Put your sewage pipes upriver of your water pumps and... bad things happen. The game cares about water flow and water direction and even has a water model, so when you build that hydro-electric dam across your river, more bad things can happen. Underground pipes spread water and remove sewage from neighbourhoods, which you have to draw.  Public transport is also fun but, bizarrely for a game that descends from one that was designed exclusively about this, it isn't as satisfying as it could be. The rail system is excellent and ports work amazingly. I created a port-side industrial zone and gave it a rail connection and the industrial zone around it went into a mass fit of productivity and investment, which is the first time in any city building game that's happened. The number of times I've tried to zone proper port districts and failed beggars belief. However, the bus system, although simplified, can be a bit hard to use and place lines, while metro systems remain totally below ground and you can't cross paths by having one line go below another. The platforms on the stations are awkward to place and the system could do with a bit of a tweak, which serves to make an excellent system merely good.  Cities: Skyline also passes one amazingly important test, which is hard to adequately quantify. It's that of building a city based on how you know your local city or town to work and having the game actually pick up on that and work with you. Cities: Skylines passes this test superbly. I could replicate structures and road patterns I actually see and have them work or not work with effects that match what I see in real life. It creates a game with a great feel. For example, the success of my port district then overloaded the local highway interchange. Trying to fix that was an exercise in the harsh realities of traffic planning and exactly what should happen with a port district and trying to fix it an education in building large through-flow traffic junctions, like I see near airports in London.  Having played it for a while, there are a couple of bugbears I'd like to pick up. The park system is one of them. Parks are rectangular, which makes for awkwardness and difficulty placing them. In the Cities franchise, parks could be made to fit left over area, looking fantastic. I wish this could be done here, to fill in bits and bob left over from non-grid road patterns. Also, something to use dead space in the middle of roads would be good. It would be nice to put parks behind buildings, or create communal gardens. The system also made the Cities franchise farming system work a lot better than it does in Skyline. farms could be dynamically assigned over area between mud track roads.  The second bugbear is that there is no tunnelling. In CiM, roads could be elevated or tunnelled with ease. Here, only elevation works, although the elevation hsystem has been overhauled to be more realistic (no, the pylon supporting your highway can't sprout from the middle of a road). Tunnelling would be such a useful addition and would give some more complication to laying water pipes, which at the moment is a bit simplistic. Both of these are the two biggest shatterers of the almost realistic quality of the simulation.  Cities: Skyline is the most innovative game of the city building genre to come along in a very long time. It's attention to detail is refreshing and wonderful. I can't recommend it enough.",

No, but what game is? The one thing that Simcity 2013 had that I'd enjoy an introduction to in Cities: Skyline is modular buildings like hospital and universities that allowed you to design sprawling complexes seen at real universities and hospitals.

            "review_text": "Having played longer I feel like updating my review. The game is really great in principle and I still happily recommend it. The good points are all over the 'net and the core gameplay is very enjoyable. However there are issues that become very evident at higher population levels and other than designing your city entirely to work around the game's design mechanics or using mods, the player isn't given tools to combat these issues. This is very unfortunate as it makes building large, realistic-feeling yet functional cities seemingly impossible without 'gaming' the game. I'll be focusing on the negatives here, hopefully they'll get fixed eventually. Polished large-scale city gameplay combined with the game's ridiculously good modding support would probably make me play this game happily for the next 10 years.  The main problem is how the traffic works. Traffic in the game can be roughly divided into commuters, deliveries, services and industry import/export. The industry, delivery and service traffic function in a fairly intuitive manner and there's nothing specifically wrong with how they operate. However the more general traffic issues outlined below causes huge industry traffic blockages and completely negates services as the service vehicles can never get where they're supposed to, with ultimately citizens moving out because bodies and trash never get collected. Similarly commercial deliveries can take such a long time that businesses start shutting down.  The game is very happy with placing traffic lights but doesn't have green waves. AI drivers don't use multiple lanes efficiently and they don't take current amount of traffic on their route into consideration, thus completely saturating any chokepoints instead of taking alternative routes that are completely open. Buses actually make the situation worse in high-traffic situations because there are no bus lanes, and a bus stopping to pick up passengers entirely blocks the traffic behind it. The game seems to decide the number of buses on a given route very arbitrarily and the buses aren't spaced out temporally so they tend to form massive bus queues that others cannot bypass.  Service and delivery vehicles cause a similar blocking problem because while they're doing their thing they can't be bypassed either, which leads the traffic degrading into stop-start-stop-start pattern on busy roads. Green waves, more control over traffic lights (and smarter automatic placement, as they definitely are useful at times) and bus/service lanes would mitigate these issues greatly.  Commuters barely ever seems to use trains, even though they're potentially the fastest transport for long routes. The number of tourists coming in, either by train, car or boat, is so minimal there isn't any point in building transport for them. The train AI also occasionally seems to deadlock, possibly because of the large number of trains the system spawns. In-city cargo trains from industrial areas getting sent to depots in areas that are completely gridlocked also just makes the traffic worse, even though generally the cargo train depots are a great way of controlling where the industrial goods traffic flows. The game could monitor how efficiently goods are being distributed all the way to their destinations from any given depot at a given time and prefer better working depots, thus giving depots in oversaturated areas time to breathe.  The player can't really find out what the root causes of their traffic issues are at any given time, which compounds all the specific issues with how traffic works. The tools and data just aren't there, or they're really well hidden. Spying on random cars isn't the solution, neither is trying a bunch of random changes to the road network. Giving the player tools to see the overall traffic flows, instead of just 'high traffic here', would allow for actually fixing the problematic areas' core issues, instead of just trying a bunch of random stop-gap measures.  Another valuable aid would be a mechanism that'd allow the player to see how large percentage of people in a given area are using public transport and what their main reasons are for not using it. Currently if one transport route has 20% efficiency and another one 180%, the player can't really find out where the difference comes from. In a similar vein, it'd be really useful to be able to see what the reasons were for any given commuter for choosing the mode of transport they're in. These tools would go a long way to developing actually useful public transport routes.  As for non-traffic issues, unique buildings are almost useless because most of them seem to be worse at improving the environment than plazas, parks etc that are multiple times cheaper and smaller. Since they don't even seem to attract more tourists to your city there's no point in building them. Monuments feel like cheating, for example once you've gotten to a point where you have a well working education system in your city, you're given a building that completely makes all that work redundant. The other monuments are the same, and I never place them in my cities. I don't have all of them unlocked though because of the unlock requirements that require you to actively play the game badly.  The land value system doesn't really make sense because if there are scenic or environmental factors in the calculation, they're unnoticeable. For example green zones, low density high class residential areas or any non-polluted waterfront areas are pointless. Instead you just end up spamming the most effective recreational object everywhere where land value is low. The decoration system is, perhaps, along with the unique buildings and monuments, the game's most lacking aspec. It could do with a complete rehaul, perhaps replacing decorative buildings with recreational zoning that'd level up like RCI zones do and (if in good condition) improve the land value around it.  Wow, that was a long review. I guess it's because I really love the game despite its faults, and as patches and expansions come along I hope I can just erase the entire review paragraph by paragraph.",

Now in the interest of full disclosure - I never played Sim City 5. I hate games that force me to be online all the time. I also hate EA being too pigheaded to release games on Steam. However I did follow the gaming disaster that is Sim City 5 in all the news articles and I did belly laugh hard when EA/Maxis's chickens came home to roost like I predicted they would.  Anyway back to C:S - What do I love about it? What do I hate? (short answer: there's nothing really to hate about it, but there is plenty to love).  Pros: + Easy to learn + Cities look great and feel teeming with life + You can rename anything and there doesn't appear to be a character limit + Roads and districts are fun to place + Massive cities!  Cons: - A little too easy (I'm on my first city and it's been no challenge building a fully renewable powered city right from the go) - AA jaggies a bit of a distraction - The max size of zones from road needs to be bigger IMO (the gaps between streets are too small) - Buildings are a bit generic, but DLC and mods are on the way for this - Dams are broken (I've got 2 dams blocking off a river that branches and they're both producing 0 MW yet the arrows show water flowing into one of those dams)  Overall this is a damn (pun intended!) good city builder and anyone who says otherwise needs a frontal lobotomy.",

I would love to see vehicles use alternate routes if the shortest one has heavy traffic.  The game provides little guidance on what you're doing wrong. We could use more alerts that our utilities are nearing capacity or suggestions on how to alleviate traffic, or design efficient mass transit.  The game is extremely forgiving and encourages iterating. Move special buildings a big help. Bulldoze large neighbourhoods to build that highway. Highway roundabout? Sure thing!

You can manage a lot of things; -You can manage the budget of power water education sanity etc. -You have to deal with trafic and dat's the key point of this game you need a fluid traffic if u don't have this ur city is cursed is going to fail very hard why ?  Because if you have ♥♥♥♥ traffic ur citizens won't have acces to services and dat mean bodys and trash piling up sick citizen's bad police and firefighters won't arrive to fight your citizens fire's .... -You can micromanage your city really hard with districs you can raise taxes power industry or your big buissnes or the little buissnes you can deny heavy traffic in certain zones. -You can allow them to smoke weed power education power recycling etc etc also this things will have a positive thing and a bad one also you can give citizens hig tech housing and they will be happyer and dat bring us to another point ur citizens must be happy because if they are happy they upgrade theyr houses dat's mean more citizens in less space and better industry etc etc You can build public transport dat means bus metro harbours trains and airport and this stuff will reduce ur city traffic and bring tourist to your city, To make tourist come to ur city you must build monuments so they have something to visit. Also you can build cargo harbours and trains to bring raw materials to your industry. And dat's all abaout the gameplay of this review.  And yeah you can make sinks to flood your citizens or make them eat theyr ♥♥♥♥♥ed watter .  And 1 think I wanna point out is performance it runs quite well but I have one big problem there if I lower graphics settings the fps still the same and witout having a big big city +100k citizens I had bad fps  Also this game lacks of anny coop or multiplayer to trade with other cityes and cooperate but they put effort to do other things so u don't lack a really crucial thing there. To end this review I am going to say is the best sim city builder and it has a good price 30€ and tons of mods.",

I did however, run into some stipulations...FYI: Spoiler alerts... 4 major issues come to mind. Read on if you wish, but overall I DO recommend this game for you urban planners out there.  Issue 1. City Stagnation: You can have a perfectly well-ordered city, with all the amenities needed for a perfect life, but if your city does not grow or change zoning placement... It dies. Meaning, if you do not continuously attend your RCI, and try to let your well-optimized city run for a decade or two, people simply leave and it causes a cascade of issues. So either you grow the town, or re-arrange it every few years. Otherwise, it seems like the citizens get bored and move on, or just die and forget to reproduce.  Issue 2. Total anticlimax with the Space Elevator. Seriously. One would assume it goes up and up and up, right? It does not. It is merely a high-tech building that attracts tourists. Don't worry I will get over it, but it is nothing that I imagined a space elevator to look like. Looks more like a Starcraft Terran building, with rotating radar dishes and all, minus the SCVs.  Issue 3. Ridiculous requirements for some locked buildings. Like the Observatory... This completely bothered me so I am going to get harsh here. You literally have to have 1000 abandoned buildings in order to unlock an observatory. I am pretty sure a lot of ancient civilizations unlocked their Observatories simply by looking up, and deciding 'Hey, this is a nice spot.' Somehow, in 'today's world', if you wish to unlock the secret of the heavens, one must first locate a once-occupied urban district, now entirely abandoned, rather than a nice open, high-elevated desert. Makes sense to me!  Issue 4. No Civic Buildings? Yes I know there are fire departments and police departments... But no Town Hall. I really am wondering who runs my city every time I play. I figure it's either the commercial or the office zone people. Or gawd. *Shrug*  Other than that. Great game. Very addictive. Sucked me in and did not let go for the entire weekend. Had a blast. I am sure mods and updates will polish it off. If Simcity 2013 (Other than the tiny city size and no underground, I liked that game) were mixed with this game (Mega Towers and what-not), I would have my mind blown and never be able to play another city-builder again. Paradox games rock, and this hit my top 10. I could discuss the Pros but I think everyone else has covered that. Too many to list.",

There are already tons of extra content available via workshop and almost anything I could think of as a feature that was missing has already been modded into the game.  Gameplay is what I guess you should expect from a city builder. You start off with the basics and work your way up.

The Workshop is there, filled with tons of intersections you can choose from. Sick of seeing the same Police Cars/Firetrucks all the time. Search for new models on the Workshop, same with houses.

This, however, I can get sucked into for hours on end. There's just something so... magical about watching your city grow from a tiny town into a huge metropolis. Watching people move in, go about their daily lives. It's just so magical and I love it. Admittedly, I'm not the best city planner out there, but watching my cities grow makes me want to try harder, as if I'm actually the mayor of the city and those models representing people are my constituents. I want to keep them happy, even though I know that in reality they're just virtual.  The mechanics are very in-depth. Don't educate your people well enough and businesses that need educated workers will shut down, but if you require everyone to get an education your businesses might not have enough workers to operate and shut down. Will you build a residential zone in this area you just built, or will you build industry there? What about power; will you have enough? Should you use coal power or wind power? I love things like this, they really make me think about what to do before I act and in the end it's very rewarding.  Oh yeah, you can district different parts of your city, and enforce different policies per district. As in, you want your industry to recycle as well as having smoke detectors, while another part of town just enforces smoke detectors and somewhere you don't want people to have pets (such as an apartment complex), you can ban pets, all without any policies overlapping one another. How cool is that?  However, it's not without its faults. Police are overpowered while the fire department is underpowered, traffic management in the base game is poor and criminal justice (again, in the base game) is very barebones. Also, you don't unlock some very environment-protecting assets until your city reaches a population of 16000; in my opinion, some of them, such as waste treatment plants, should be unlocked sooner. Chirper, the in-game version of Twitter, is also a mixed bag; it tends to give you useful information about how your citizens feel, but they also tend to overuse #hashtags and it gets really annoying to find out that your #cat was saved by a #smokedetector for the 15 billionth time. It's also full of jokes and pop culture references. Take that last one as you will.  So, overall, do I recommend Cities: Skylines? YES! Especially if you're big on simulation games. If not, it's still worth checking out; you might be pleasantly surprised, as was I.",

When I see a quintessential city builder, I think it should follow that sme basic pattern of feeling like god. You are placed in this third person role of creating something bigger than yourself and hoping that you can make the best, most beautiful city you've ever seen. To guide or crush your subjects as you see fit. Does Skylines achieve this feeling? Yes, yes and more yes. This game is classic iteration on an amazing concept introduced long ago. Do you feel like god? Hell yes. Can you build something great? Yes! Not just great but unique and beautiful that's all your own. Can you create some dystopian hell hole? Yes! Pollution and crime can run amok as you scour your terrain looking for a good place to build industry and power plants to choke your people who have no education or even way to dispose of the many bodies you are creating.   This game is the city builder which future builders should be compared against. This is the new 'gold standard.'   Purchase this game because I am sure you will have it in your back pocket for rainy days years to come. Enjoy it. Get lost in the scenic vistas. Get lost in the zen enjoyment of creation.   &lt;b&gt;The cons:&lt;/b&gt;  When I attempted to use the terrain builder to make a map it felt very cumbersome and was not enjoyable and easy to use as it could be. I did't find it enjoyable at all to create maps, it felt like work. I am sure I will come back to it but I think it should be easier to use.   &lt;b&gt;Rating:&lt;/b&gt;  Rating 10/10 because I didn't even expect to be able to make maps in game, despite the cumbersome interface it was an unexpected surprise to have this ability in the first place.  As for the game I purchased: the city builder. It's perfect. Keep making great things devs, and know that you have really hit the nail on the head.",

I cannot recommend this game highly enough for those of you who like me have been waiting for a good city builder game. The graphics are awesome, the citizens actually do have homes and jobs and little virtual lives that you can view. The entire game has a high level of polish and the UI is very well done.  The game isn't hard - you don't have to worry about losing. Instead it focuses on setting your own goals and giving you a giant sandbox in which to accomplish them. The scale of the cities you can build is pretty huge (and there are mods to make it even huger). Your biggest problem is traffic, adding a pseudo puzzle quality to the game. I'm constantly on the lookout for ways to make my cities transportation network more efficient so I can wedge in a few more people. Fortunately, the toolset for managing traffic is very deep. You can just slap down roads and let the citizens fend for themselves, or you can dive in and spend days tweaking intersections, crosswalks, one-/two-way streets, street light positions, etc.  I love this game, and I can recommend it with no reservations.",

The game has very fluid controlls and plenty of boxes that will help explain tools without needing to look things up on youtube. What the game lacks in detail, there are so many mods that add to this game. The amount of modding that Cities allows for is also a huge plus. It will keep the game alive so much longer than any other City simulation game (to this point in time).   I love this game. It appeals to the casual gamer and to the more strategic city builder.

I got the expansion pack with the added buildings, bike lanes and transit options, I say it's well worth the money they're asking.

I felt like because of it building became more repetitive after a while, but maybe that's just me.   I got frustrated because I forgot to complete all the achievements while building the city, for example there is achievements like 'have 90% of your city be sick' or something and those are near impossible to do in end game when you already got a big city. These achievements are also required to build wonders (or to 'complete' the game) so watch out for them if you are going to buy this game.

I give this game a solid 8.5/10  I'd give it a 9/10, but there is very VERY few hints given when you need them most, esp as a newer player (a few months back). Maybe add in a tutorial save and make new players play this, and let them choose to skip to a fresh save.

An all-encompassing experience of zoning and sewage, for less than average price.

That's a lot of entertainment and well worth the money.  (There's a TL;DR of sorts at the bottom)  It deliciously picks up the city simulation genre and is almost all I wanted a modern Sim City to be. Almost. There are some things that slowly started to... nag. Some things feel like they're lacking, like events. Any events. Other than buildings being abandoned or burning down.  Say, for example, some political alignments in your Cims. Strikes if you don't handle industry well for the workers, or business moving elsewhere if the industry executives feel disappointed with you. Maybe even riots, with things going South, if you don't handle the strikes. More... citizen dynamics. You still have happiness but over time it kind of feels mostly like it's enough to place a couple of parks and service buildings nearby an area and everyone's happy. Not really a challenge.  Traffic is a challenge, and I love it. But the 'only' real problem with traffic is congestion (and route length I guess). If people or delivery trucks won't reach their destinations fast enough, it can hurt the economy quite a bit. However, there are no such things as accidents, which would've been kind of cool to deal with somehow. Not only to plan roads that allow for good flow, but that keeps the risk of accidents low.  I won't really mention the bugs too much. There are bugs, like dead bodies not being picked up sometimes even though the cemetary is across the street, but it's merely a small nuisance and not overly game-breaking. Then there's the kind of dull limitation when building things on slopes. It feels like it says 'Slope too steep' a little too often, and I would love to be able to build more wavy towns.  I'm no expert by any means but I don't aspire to be one either. I play this kind of game to be immersed in a believable city simulation where I actually feel I care for the people in the town. I don't like it when I start seeing only numbers and stats, which it feels like I've drifted towards doing lately. I'll keep playing it because I still enjoy it, and maybe I'll understand things about it that makes me appreciate it even more.  Personally, I would love more varied and relevant Chirper (the in-game virtual twitter thing) messages, or a news paper like in Sim City 2000, or maybe gifts and favors from happy citizens, or random festivals. Business proposals from other cities or whatever. Events to shake things up, where you either try to deal with what's suddenly happening or can make interesting choices. 'Hey, NASA wants to build a launch base. It'll take a lot of room, but you'll get tons of money!' More control of the range and funding of separate service buildings.  The bottom line for me I think is that I would love more life. Sure, there's visually tons of life in the city. Thousands of people and cars and bikes and dogs. They're probably very important and 'real' for the simulation, too. But there's something lacking in the 'personal' connection between me and them. The Chirper gets way too repetitive to work as such a connection for longer than an hour or two, in my opinion. I want to see them angry, sad and happy. Stressed and relaxed... etc.  Also, more management. More control, especially over city services. Let me pick a priority area for trash collection, for example, or maybe order a certain police station to focus patrols on a certain area, or tell a hospital to focus on an area. Maybe let me lower or increase funding to a specific service building (now there's only an ON and OFF for a building).  Of course, there are mods for the game that adds complexity, which is really great and I respect the game developers for adding that ability (managing mods is a breeze) and the modding community for producing such advanced stuff. Hoping that we'll see the API getting broader and that we get more DLC that officially flesh out more parts of the game. After Dark was a nice little bit of candy, but it still feels like there's a lot that can be added to really make the package feel complete.  An attempt at a TL;DR... It's a great game. Looks great, sounds great, plays great. Even runs pretty great on Linux (Mint). Great modding support, and great tools for making your own assets and even custom buildings from within the game. You'll spend a lot of hours of lovingly growing and taking care of your city, and there's plenty of visual variation. Traffic planning is a really fun challenge. I'm hoping that more depth and control is added to city services, and that the citizens can be made to feel more real and 'human' and less like stats. I'd like interesting and relevant events to happen. A pinch of politics would be nice.",

I knocked off another point because of the lack of tutorials. There are tooltips, but they seem to change whenever they feel like it. Other than that, this game is well worth the $30.",

A majority of the population couldn't graduate from high school and the kids really didn't like going so I stopped funding those too.

Pros: - Great simulation of agents. Unlike Simcity, Cities: Skylines tracks where your citizens live and work, as well as their level of education, whether or not they own a car, and their age. If you want to actually follow people around on their day to day lives, this game makes that possible. - Very flexible road and highway tools. - Easy modding integration with Steam means that there is a ton of user made content to play with. - Map and asset editor in game. - Massive maps that can be modded to be even larger if you'd like. - User friendly interface that makes this game great for people new to the genre. - An upbeat soundtrack. - Well optimized. Loads quickly and runs smoothly. - $30 on release is a very fair price for what you get.  Cons: - No day / night cycle, weather, or seasons. - Limited structure assets. Lots of repeated buildings around cities. - Complicated traffic structures are tough to pull off in game (though can be made, slowly, in the asset editor). - Almost every aspect of the game (even data menus) has to be unlocked by population. This can be disabled with a built in mod, but some buildings and features feel like they should be unlocked. - Unique buildings are locked out with a mini achievement-like system that feels arbitarily. This can also be disabled with a built in mod, but it seems like they should instead have a different method of unlocking. - The game's 'chirps' are a mix between helpful messages and spam.  All in all, the pros outweight the cons tremendously, and if you like city building games, then you shouldn't miss this one for any reason.",

Traffic is fun to work out and problem solve. wither you're making sprawling suburbs or bustling urban landscapes, you'll love it. The day night cycle from this games first DLC is simply stunning to see the lights of your city light up the areas it occupies. The game is easy to learn once you start to understand the basics of road system design. There are things that could have been improved or changed with this game, things like traffic AI, and lack of subtle change between the buildings with the only 2 options for density.

It takes the great benefits of the new Simcity, and makes everythings that Simcity done wrong in a great way. No more region with different part (altough you need to buy land plots).    The graphic is good enough.    The traffic system is extremly challenging.    This game is only limited by your own creativity.

'no' it not same, C:S have bigger map (with mod u can unlock 25 tiles), advanced road system (u can make beautiful intersection with C;S road system, don't believe me? just go to C;S workshop and look for intersection, there is many modders share their beautiful intersection), advanced public transport, Tons of assets enhancement (if u feel bored with assets variety from main C:S file, just go to Workshop, so many variety assets that will make ur city more live)  so if u love city builder games with good community inside, just grab C:S. totally worth to buy :)",

I have never played a Sims game so I can't compare Cities to that series. However, I did grow up playing the Roller Coaster Tycoon series and to me this game is very reminiscent of that.  The steam workshop in this game really helps with the longevity of the game. It keeps things fresh and really allows you to personalize your city.  The only issues that I have ever had are:   1. The game can be confusing to new players, the lack of instruction is almost as if CO expects you to have played the first Cities game.  However, guides can very easily be found on Youtube as well as right here on Steam.  2. The extremely long load times when your city starts to get up in the 80,000+ range in terms of population.  However, it's expected since the city at that point is fairly large, and whatever you have placed in the world from the workshop only makes the load times longer.   3. Corrupt maps when you delete some buildings/monuments from your world that you have downloaded from the workshop.  This is less of a problem for me now, when the game first came out it was a big issue and I have recently found myself being able to go back to my corrupt maps and begin rebuilding! Huge ++  4. The frame drop in larger cities is almost unbearable.  Again, this is expected since it can be very crowded in some places. It's a personal issue for me since I have a habit of building metropoleis full of workshop skyscrapers. I'm sure the problem would be at least a little less noticeable in cities that are more spread out.  All in all, I think this game is well worth whatever price you happen to find it at. I haven't purchased the After Dark DLC yet, but I do plan to do so now that I am getting back into this game with my old cities functioning properly again!",

The most bothersome quality about this game is the numerous visual layers (water, electric, pollution, traffic, etc.), which though wonderful in and of themselves, are pretty much the only way you can navigate the game at night. The map gets incredibly dark, and does nothing to assist you with building or modifying your city until sunrise, forcing you to awkwardly hop through view layers to actually see what you're doing, since these effectively disable night until escaped out of.  Edit: In addition, the longer one goes in playing this game, the more frustrating one tends to find some of the more obvious limitations. One is terraforming. Super obvious, and no good reason why it isn't build into the game. Relying on community mods is an option, but points towards laziness from the developers.",

Here are a few tips to help get you started:  1. Make use of all of the land possible. This means you can zone all of the land inside of the square or rectange of road. Maintaining roads cost a lot. This made me restart my city a few times.  2. Raise your tax to 11%. I know it sounds like a lot lol but this is the highest you can go without the cims complaining.  3. Lower your budget a bit. You can lower every budget panel to 75% exept power and electricity. You can keep that at 100%.  4. Do not use districts untill a much higher level or not use them at all. Using districts cost a ton of money so if you ask me, dont use them.  5. Make a lot of garbage dumps. But do not place them next to residential areas. Make them somewhat spread around your city.  Hope this guide helped you start your first city! This game is really fun so I want to make sure you get the most out of this game!!",

No need to manage nonsense trade and commuters between City plots since it is one city. Steam Workshop!  UI is very nice for getting the information you need. Visually, not the same level of polish as Sim City, so that is 1 con.  As a city builder it is great, as a city management simulation its a bit dry. I personally felt detached from the citizens.  Overall I give it a 8.5/10 and would recommend!",

I like the way it is easier to use then sim city games, (and i love the sim city games)   Pros It is simple to use, if you take the time to. zooming in and out different options for roads.  okay could i just say everything  Cons- I don't know if there is a bad thing really.

The game itself is in its basics quite typical for a City Management Game, you build roads, provide water and electricity and define zones where your sims will build up houses, industie and commerce. Contrary to most other games though, they actually go as far as to simulate every single sim living in your city. That means that Mr. Simons, working at the Pawn Shop downtown, will actually get up in the morning and try to get to work. So depending on your cities public transport he will either use the bus , tram, underground or the car. Of course he will then in the evening return home, go shopping or anything else he might think of. As the city grows it will become more and more challenging to provide a working traffic management.  Manageing traffic however is just one of the many cogs that the player will need to manipulate in order to keep his or her city healthy. Education, Trash, Health and Safety are also things to consider. You also have a plentitude of edicts you can give out to change things in your city.   I really liked the micromanagement part and spent hours and hours working on my city. I think i trashed the first four cities because I learned later that I could have done several things a lot smoother and deceided to start again. This didnt really lessen the fun of the game though. I strongly recommend this game for people who want to take their time playing a game. If you look for a quick session once in a while you might not be happy with City Skylines because it always takes a lot of time to get back into the flow when not remembering what in your city was to be done next.

            "review_text": "==Personal Thoughts== For me (and evidently for many others), Cities: Skylines fills in the hole that was left behind when SimCity flopped, and does so remarkably well. This is a good game. It's also not that expensive, so if you're looking for a modern city simulator, buy it.  ==The Good== + People used to other city builder games will adapt to this one very quickly. + Cloud syncing! I have my SimCity 4 data synced to my Dropbox. It's nice to have this kind of feature baked into the game. + Far better than SimCity at handling elevated/underground transportation, and offers curved roads on top of that. + Per-district policies. + Lots of mods and other third-party content. + User-friendly interface. + It runs on Linux and Mac.  ==The Bad== + Doesn't really have a tutorial built in, so new players are immediately thrown into the deep end. + Game engine is fairly demanding. The GPU isn't too important; my desktop's 750 Ti is more than enough, and if I run it on near-minimum settings, I can even get it to run on my laptop's HD Graphics 3000. However, running large cities at speed requires a LOT of CPU power, and my aging computers can't keep up. Cities: Skylines is designed to try and avoid FPS drops, so the actual gameplay remains smooth, but once the city reaches a substantial size, the flow of time slows down quite badly. I imagine that a modern Core i5 would handle it fine.  ==Other Thoughts== + More so than with SimCity 4, and especially more so than with older SimCity installments (e.g. 3000 and 2000), Cities: Skylines requires that you be somewhat clever with your city layout. Commercial zones need very reliable connections to industrial zones, or they won't have any goods to sell and will close. Industrial zones need good outside connections so they can import the raw materials they need to create goods. Fossil fuel power plants will shut down if they can't get the resources they need, so it's more optimal to place them near structures such as highways and rails. You'll ESPECIALLY have to pay attention to your transportation grid, as Cities: Skylines is much fussier about transportation than SimCity. Put some thought into your roads before building then, or you'll end up desperately and hilariously hacking more and more stuff into the grid in vain hopes that eventually, SOMETHING will improve. Fused grid layouts and roundabouts generally produce good results.  ==Some differences from SimCity== + City boundaries can be expanded. + Unlike in SimCity 4, and as with earlier SimCity titles, you control only a single city, not a whole region. + Sewage processing is a requirement and not having it will cause sewage to back up into people's houses. For obvious reasons, sewage drains should be located downstream from pumping stations. + Some means of processing dead people is required (e.g. cemetaries or crematoriums). + No medium-density zones. + Mass transit lines must be manually drawn; in SimCity, they are automatically calculated. + Per-district policies and ordinances. + More control over industrial zones (e.g. you can specify oil industry, forestry, etc.) + No elevated subways or monorails. However, elevated train tracks are present as mentioned in the pros, so that offsets the loss. + Utilities don't break down after a preset amount of time. + No natural gas power plants. + Offshore wind turbines are a thing. + Hydroelectric dams exist and will cause flooding if built. + The fusion power plant, if you unlock it, is enough to singlehandedly power the entire city at maximum size. This isn't different from SimCity 4, but it's definitely different from SimCity 3000. + Highways are one-directional, so you have to lay them in both directions. + Has four- and six-lane roads as opposed to SimCity's avenues. One wonders why you'd ever use four-lane roads, and the answer is that they produce less noise from traffic. + No recycling centers. Recycling is instead handled as a policy. + Neighbor deals are nonexistent, but transportation in and out of the city is still relevant and must be handled adequately.",

I have not gotten to a larger sized cities yet, and I will update the review after more hours into the game.  I am looking forward to future projects from this studio and if any studio is going to release quality DLCs I believe they will be it.  EDIT: After a bit longer on the release I have to say the game has been disappointing. At a certain point, the game become an aggrivating experience in fixing one traffic problem after another.",

Select item, right click and drag to rotate, easy to do once you know.    the inability to undo.......but at least you get a refund for destruction.     difficulty in making bus routes go where you want them. My solution make more stops to limit possible paths.    workshop add-on to show angles of curves and snap points great for precise control of road curves, and shapes, should be part of the game.  The workshop and editor make a good product, great!  Short of adding different visuals, I cant think of anything significant to make this a better product.  Suggestions:    Possibly the ability to control timing of traffic lights, users could create a traffic light object and save the timing.    Parking lots, or control of parking on the side of road, effectively making it wider for heavy traffic.    Use of GPS to determine the fastest route based on traffic flow, and policies.    Creation of traffic monitoring object for a limited area to work with GPS.    Accidents    Mountainous terrain limiting traffic, resources and development ruining enviroment and tourism.    Cities split by national boundaries (build a wall) and nations with different labour, infrastructure and tax issues.  Very well done, as far as city builders go 9.6 out of 10! ;-)  ",

        {
            "review_text": "TL;DR: I would recommend it, though it is not as good as Sim City 4.  Long version:  Cities: Skylines was the answer of a joke called Sim City (2013), which maybe has been the worst city-building-game in history. C:S took a loot of things from SC13 and made it better. You still have zoning and you start in a small area, but since you start your game by 0 with only a few dollarinos, it's part of your own development as a mayor to expand your borders, claim new building spaces and expand your city or instead build several small villages. You can look up on Youtube for really good cities which have been created with this game; and if you take your time to build your city slowly, you can experience a nice time while watching your city growing by getting bigger and becoming more educated and richer.   But there are still some flaws within the game which really made me upset.  1) All your buildings need a street connection. You cannot place a park in the middle of a block, no, they NEED a connection. This results, if you have big blocks with a non-building-space in the middle, in a green void filled by a few trees and pedestrian streets.  2) the good thing is: You have several industrial zones: farming, metal works, forest industry and the common industry. The bad thing is: You have to unlock everything except the common industry. So when you finally can place farms (very small ones I want to add) you already have several districts with high polluting industry buildings. Remember in SC4, when you could build small farm villages from the start on, with a farmer's market and big ♥♥♥ field? Not gonna happen in C:S.  3) You even have to unlock streets. This isn's a bad thing. The bad thing is, that in the beginning you have to high way lanes ending in your territory, marking the outside connection for your city. The very first street you have to build must connect with this street-limbs, or else nobody will be able to move to your town. You are forced to connect 2-lane-road to each of the endings (each highway lane is a one direction road, why the ♥♥♥♥ ever, I'm not familiar with the highway design in the US). This looks ♥♥♥♥♥♥ as ♥♥♥♥, since every two-lane-road has also a sidewalk, even if it's in the middle of nowhere. Also the transition from highway to normal street looks not good. 4) The AI is ♥♥♥♥ing awful. Imagine this: You have a three lane highway, every lane leads into the same direction. Somewhere in the distance there is a freeway exit to your industrial district. And a few hundred meters after that, there is another exit for your city. Now every. ♥♥♥♥ing. vehicle is taking the right lane, no matter if the other lanes are completly unused. There will be a huge traffic jam, because a lot of vehicles try to take the first exist to a normal street, where also many cars are waiting in front of a traffic light [red]. The ones who want to drive to your city just stay in the traffic jam until they can move on, still on the right lane. It's ridiculous it can really upset you, trust me, 'cause the traffic statistics tell you that there is a huge traffic overload and you can't do ♥♥♥♥ to prevent it.  5) flat ♥♥♥ maps. Remember Sim City, when you can start next to a big ♥♥♥ mountain? Well, the maps of C:S are all as flat as Paris Hilton and look as empty as her eyes.   Of course there are mods out there. And there are many awesome mods which provides you more depth in your statistics and stuff. Also there is a huge, HUGE amount of additional buildings for every zone you can place on your map. Mods can fix everything of the said problems, except the driving AI. But if you use mods, you can't get your achievements. I guess this game is like Skyrim. It becomes really good if you mod the ♥♥♥♥ out of it. I'm one of the few players who like vanilla games aswell and finish everything in vanilla before modding it. And the vanilla game itself is pretty weak. Remember in Sim City 4, when the first skyscraper plopped up? It was like defeating Smough and Ornstein solo for the first time. When the first skyscrapers appeared in C:S, I didn't feel anything. I guess I'm dead from the inside. Or maybe this game doesn't have as much heart and soul in it as I expected it to have. Or maybe both.   But: It still is the best modern city-building-game out there. If you like to creat small comfy villages: This game is not designed to provide you this stuff, it's build to create big cities. It still cannot beat Sim City 4. The soundtrack is also not as good. Nothing can beat the SC4-Soundtrack.  EDIT: The game makes much more fun with the day-and-night-cycle.",

Game rewards you for planning ahead and making clever mass transit choices. Disappointing graphics, unless you're able to run it at 4k resolution. Needs a lot of mods, and a potent gaming PC to get the most out of it. A great game, although for me feels a little sterile at times.  Pros:-  *Vanilla version provides a solid, albeit basic city building experience, with a minimum of 36 sq. km of space to build on without mods. As expansions were released game shipped with day/night cycle, and weather as part of the game. *Scope of maps, and buildable area up to 324 sq. km with mods. *Very strong modding community. *The biggest strength of this game is in the transportation model. While basic in vanilla, without mods, does reward you for good planning and execution. *By far the best city builder out at the moment, with the devs regularly updating and making improvements.  Cons:-  *You need a lot of mods to get the most out of this game - the basic game experience is good, but with mods it makes it a whole lot better/flexible. *While some will disagree, you do need a pretty potent gaming rig to run this well. But to be fair, anything over 20fps while fully zoomed in is more than playable. *At 1080p, for me the graphics are disappointing, even at max detail. Big issue is quality of AA in game engine. But, in defense of the devs, the scope of this game goes a long way to make up for it. *Game can feel a little sterile at times. At the risk of being really unfair, sometimes this game doesn't feel as fun as SimCity 2013 did for me (flaws of that game and all).",

So when the sale price for Skylines grabbed my attention the first thing I went off and searched about t'interweb was 'Sim City 4 vs Cities: Skylines'. The results you will find are pretty much unanimously that it is the natural successor starting where SC4 is now with all its mod base... so I bit the bullet - and I am VERY pleased I did. Move over SC4 - your crown has well and truely been usurped. Skylines is FANTASTIC. It provides the full 3D experience of your city in stunning quality and variety from which ever angle you desire with the same game play area of its more successful predecessor. And when it starts to get stale or you want a feature from a mod in SC4 just go look on the workshop - there are a country load of quality mods - and if not you can build your own. So I am going to agree with all the reviews I saw and shout from the tallest rooftop I can build that Cities: Skylines is well worth its title. Its aiming high and not far off being there.  Definately a recommended game from a long term fan of Sim City 4 - SC4 is dead - long live Sim City 4 - Cities: Skylines now rules the roost on this PC...",

I waited for several years for a new and decent city builder to get released and when EA didn't step up with Simcity, I was glad that someone else did. Cities: Skylines has its strong points, and some definite weakpoints, but it's a fun game to play. There is a lot of content in the base game, it is a solid experience even without the DLC, and the community has introduced some wonderful mods that take things even further. You can make it more challenging for yourself, or less challenging so you can just build to your hears content and see what comes of it.   With that said, some of the building tools can be quite irritating when they don't want to do what they should, and some of the managment and zoning elements aren't the greatest. On top of that, I sometimes joke that this is a traffic simulator more than a city building simulator once you reach a certain point in a towns' development.   I am also not a fan of paid DLC that doesn't bring considerable content to the base game, and from what I have seen, their DLC is hit and miss on whether the hefty 15 dollar introductory price they charge is worth it (especially for disasters, which is standard city builder stuff). But even if you don't want to buy the DLC or you want to wait for the price to come down, the base game will definitely keep you entertained for some time.",

The good side should be that there is a huge workshop support for the game and tons of mods to balance the lack of content from the vanilla game.However these mods usualy buggy and make your game lagg,not to mention that 90% of the workshop content is abandon(not updated with the game version)so will not work or make your game crash or some other trubles.So good luck searching for a pin in the forest and try to find usefull,working content for your game in the workshop. If you have tons of free time,and don't mind search in the workshop for mods that work for 3x4x5x... times more then what you actually play in-game then this is the game for you. Like I said,I'm more of a casual player who like click and play,so for 30bucks I would not recommend to purchase.For 10bucks I would say ok,since you can mustard out some fun time for a few hours from this game at the begining.

Cities: Skyline unfortunately does not reflects a working city simulation, for example the cims do not need to reach work place, and the will stay happy and the industry will still be working, cims also teleport to another places with no need of road connection like university or school, those things make the game not challenging and put me off, cause I know if I start to plan my city in proper way as in real life I will not make it better, working simulation is a backbone for any city building game, and cities:skyline just did not do it right. I held my negative review for long time just to see if the developers will do something about it, but no, they released after dark DLC and the problem persist, and I do not think they inted to change anything regarding the simulation.  Other small things in the game that put me off: unnecessary building of water pipes and electric lines, just wasting time in my opinion, small farms, no air pollution and no disasters.  I know many people enjoying this game and that is good for them, but if you are looking for realistic city building with challenges please stay away. However, if you like to just build a nice looking huge city and look at it and take screenshots, this game for you.  To conclude, cities: skyline is very nice toy and really enjoyable one, but it is not a game with challenges or even reflect a city building simulation by any mean.

            "review_text": "The killer for me: The traffic simulation is some of the worst I've seen. Roads are difficult at best to get to connect correctly and many of the tools to control them are cumbersome and illogical at times. The sims love to form city wide single file lines that cause massive jams. This would be meh if the actual cars on the road didn;t actually represent a real jam that would disrupt actual other elements. Dump trucks, hearses, fire trucks, etc, will all get stuck in massive lines of traffic. sometimes only a single car wide on an otherwise empty 6 car roadway. There's nothing wrong with this type of mechanic, but you have to have a good AI behind how the cars move through the city. Many just go in endless loops all day long, never going anywhere. You always have to assume every citizen is in their car driving around 24/7. Coupled with the inability to transition between some road types and for a lack of true intersection control without complex modding, trying to figure out the roadways is a nightmare. Unless you really like to figure out bad AI systems and try to find ways to game them into working properly, this is not your game. Making simple highway to roadway interchanges is an exercise in frustration and working long hours for a goal that will either look awesome and like a logical city layout OR work perfectly with the crippled traffic AI.... but never both. The only real way to avoid the logjam is to create lightless cities that are nothing but one way streets and roundabouts. Even one traffic light or stop sign out of place (that you won;t have control over anyways) will eventually lead to a paralyzed city, even with low populations. This breaks so much of the other mechanics of the game that without cheats and mods galore, it's tough to enjoy it.   On to the DLC:  Honestly wait till it comes with the completed game or something. Many of the features only work on some maps and even though you would think there would be simple seasons, there is not. There is perpetual summer or a slog through what is a rough estimation of Alaska on a few maps. Many of the other features given are meh and become annoying at best most of the time. Night is so dark you have to turn it to day to actually work anyways, rain makes it impossible to see even a few feet so you turn it off anyways even if you don't have other DLC.  Limitations:  Cities are tiny and very limited. You can build a much larger city within the confines of a large regional grid square in SC4 than you can with what they let you unlock for areas int he vanilla game. There isn;t much point, though as the building cap severely limits your cities to what will nearly always have to become a tight cluster of sky scrapers to support a large population. Granted it takes a while to get to the building cap, it's only a fraction of the space you can actually unlock and once you hit it... that's it. nothing will grow and the game is immediadely stalemated. You can tweak and cajole but you will never get it any bigger. Also, even if you wanted to create multiple cities on separate maps and trade between them like you could in the flop Cities XL (which was an awesome concept, just poorly executed), or in a regional sharing of demand like in SC4, no. Everything is one big city per map (districts helps slightly), and there is no way of linking multiple city maps together.  Any good at all?  Like so many games in this genre, there is an awful lot of good stuff. The buildings are awesome and even though the AI sucks, the representation of traffic using cars that actually have to obey some rudimentary traffic laws and congestion is a great concept. The map squares, pollution, and other sub-systems are some of the best and most logical I have seen. All over the place there are awesome things I've never seen in a city simulator, and improvements to many things I have seen. The poor execution of the traffic, though, and the overall lack of sprawling multi-city gameplay, or even large city gameplay kill everything I love about the game very quickly.  Should you buy it?:  If you like great detail, great visuals, and are willing to spend ALOT of time working around complex tools and engine limitations, sure. Check youtube, it IS possible to make some great cities in this game. The learning curve and number of work arounds to do so is obnoxious at best and rage quit worthy at worst.   If you want a city simulator with robust tools, smart AI, Large scale gameplay, and intelligent design options... they haven't made one yet. Maybe Cities Skylines 2, or Sim City 6, maybe Cities XXXXXXXL will pull it off, I dunno. For now I'm a firm believer that the right company could make the holy grail of city sims, it's just not this company.   If you can get it and all it's DLC for less than $15USD... give it a whirl. I got frustrated with the road placements and traffic debauchary within 16 hours... maybe you'll last longer. It's not a bad game, it's just not polished and smartly designed.  ",

You nearly have absolut no realy task to do, only wait and wait and wait... when you have money build something (it's nearly impossible to get low on money) and then wait and wait again.  the only realy positv point on this game is the mod support and the fact that it has the missing SC4 elements in it, which were searched in SC5.

When Maxis moved from Sim City 4 to 'SimCity' they did a number of things I strongly disliked. One of the biggest was downsizing the map. Another was, for lack of a better term, 'cartoonizing' the graphics and the way things are done; like how roads are laid. I again preface this by saying I can't speak for anyone else, but for me, this game has everything I hated about SimCity, and nothing I liked from Sim City 4.   Add to that these restrictions on doing stuff based on population size. I spent my entire playtime wondering what the heck was going on. 'Why can't I access my taxes. Why do I have income if I have no taxes. What is my city doing?'. I was also shocked by the lack of options for many things, and the strange language used to describe things in the menu. Perhaps for ESL folks (English as a Second Language) 'Edge Scrolling Sensitivity' means the speed, but for me, I, at first, assumed it was the size around the edge where scrolling would begin. I was also never able to figure out how to slow down the speed at which I scrolled around the map using the keys.   Add to that the fact that this game runs poorly on lower-end computers. I meet all the requirements, but this game is as smooth as sandpaper. I've had some serious issues before with Colossal Order games and what I felt were their misleading 'requirements', and at the time the only reason I did not demand a full refund was my respect for Paradox, the publisher.   Well that has it's limits. The moment I'm done writing this (and posting a copy of it to the Paradox forum) I will be looking into how to get a refund for a steam product. I've never done it before and likely will never do it again; and even if it turns out I can't get a refund (I bought the game on sale) I won't be broken up about it; but to have a game that I honestly feel is WORSE than 'SimCity' - which, I note is a game so bad that when I moved, I literally left the install CD in the otherwise empty Garbage Can. I was going to leave it on the table for the next resident, but then I realized that would be cruel - to have a game WORSE than that, is just an embarrassment to myself and my ability to judge a good game prior to purchase.",

I have stopped reading the reccomended specs for games I buy since my machine's pretty powerful and I've never had problems (especially when it comes to graphics). I was soooo excited about Cities: Skylines. I bought it with no hesitation. But to my distress, even with the lowest graphics settings it lagged like no tomorrow. I checked the specs to make sure I didn't make some sort of mistake. And there it is;  Graphics: nVIDIA GeForce GTX 660, 2 GB or AMD Radeon HD 7870, 2 GB (Does not support Intel Integrated Graphics Cards)  Hopefully the devs make it compatible with Intel intergrated graphics cards. And I know that I should have read up before spending money. I just didn't expect it. At least offer a warning beforehand, that would be real nice. I'm super ♥♥♥♥♥♥.",

It's very difficult to 'fail' at a city, unless you've never played a SimCity game before and have no idea what you're doing. I've maxed out my budgets, plonked down all available monuments and just expanded and expanded and expanded... And money just keeps rolling in.  And that's roughly the point at which you realise that's all you're doing. There are no significant disasters that pop up to give you cause to alter your strategy or deal with adverse situations. Even using 'green power' has no real disadvantages so why would you build anything else?  It has an annoying 'Twitter-esque' notification which tries to convey what your population seems to be thinking, but it repeats nonsense so often that you eventually beg for a way to disable it and its annoying sound.  Your cities feel largely lifeless (since that Twitter notice seems to be as 'in touch' as you get with your people), you'll be plopping down safety services every other street because, apparently, they don't know how to drive further than a few blocks and generally... it just stops being 'fun' after its predictability becomes apparent (give it an hour or two, max).  If only Maxis and Colossal Order joined forces to make SimCity--it could've been wonderful. Each would complement the other. A pity though, that both simply fall horribly short of a genuinely *fun* experience.  If you're looking for a fun 'city sim' of sorts mixed with Settlers of old, give Banished a look. It's a bit tricky to get the hang of but the experience is infinitely more rewarding than this mindless game of plonk roads, zone 'em, plonk some more, don't forget to keep the utilities in order, plonk and zone some more, yawn...",

No town hall upgrades or achievement popups? Besides the animation, zoom detail, placing trees, and road building, this game brought nothing outstanding, instead took steps backwards (I have to pipe my entire sewage and run power lines? Ok why? Talk about micro management) I bought this hoping that it would crush the things that I hated about Simcity, but instead I found that it created dozens of it's own new problems.

Do Skyliners die at the age of 5 on a regular basis? Are all the cops in town at the donutsville donut shop not patrolling the streets of my town hence why I need a station in each of the four corners of my town?  With so many services you'd think I'd be running a deficit but I'm not. I don't know if that is even possible. No matter what I've done, I've always made money. Coverage is an issue. Even with all the services I've plopped the entirety of the town (according to the green highlighted streets) is not fully covered.   What makes this a last-gen game is laying water pipes, electric lines, the osmosis of water and electic of nearby buildings to others, multiple service buildings of the same sector having to be plopped all over the city (how many elementary schools does a town of 7,000 need?) to name a few. The lack of the little touches such as day/night intervals is also an issue (most of the world doesn't live in Norway and enjoys regular day/night cycles).  The one thing it seems to have going for it is the purchasable adjacent lands. This is what people who enjoy such simulations were crying about and so CO delivered. It does not improve upon the quality, balance or personality of the game yet this *one thing* has satisfied the hoi poloi.  I would recommend this game if it were polished, balanced, up-to-date with the decade we live in, and being finished. It falls short of 1st class city simulator but it has a large map.  ",
