            "review_text": "I didn't experience much motion sickness just a little disorientation - you are not going nearly as fast as vr rollar coasters and focusing on the enemies helps somehow. The graphics and gameplay are dope. The Ikaruga inspired ice and fire weapons are very ideal for two motion controllers in VR. I think the main problem is they need a lot more content (5 levels one enemy one boss?) and that doesn't look like it's going to happen seeing as it's fully released.. I'd gladly pay 3-5$ for an experience like this bt $10 is just too high. Recommend getting on sale. Despite my complaints it's too cool to not recommend.",

            "review_text": "DEXED has a lot going for it, awesome art direction and the gameplay is quite fun. You basically have two 'guns', ice and fire and have to target enemies according to the elements. Fire beats ice mobs, ice beats fire mobs. I cannot stress enough how nice the art is in this game, the environments are breathtaking and easy on the mind and not motion sickness inducing.  As with a lot of VR games the game is rather short, but this game has a lot of replayability and the pricing is fair and half that of many other games that are more tech demos over this polished product.  I do recommend this game because it does not entirely focus on the novelty of VR but offers an interesting take on gameplay and what the Vive controllers can do.",
