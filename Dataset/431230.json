The game is broken in a few ways, most notably that the game won't progress sometimes and you get completely stuck with no way to complete levels.   sucky.",

            "review_text": "Mobile port and plays like it. Its supposed to be like some sort of TD game, although it has no powers. There's no mazing, no pathing etc. Instead you spawn guys aorund a person you can't control and they fight guys along the set path he travels. Thats the whole game. Every level feels super similar. There are different guys you can summon, but they don't behave much differently and even their powers are uninteresting. The worst part is the clear mobile controls. You can't click on units and then click to move them. You have to drag them, for some reason. Also you can't click and drag to select multiple units. This is especially annoying because when you want to select 1 guy or another and they are close to each other it will select 1 but you can never move the other guy. You can't target or click on enemies to attack them. It's super stupid how you can't control the main guy, as he usually stands right in the middle of everything and just takes damage. Levels can be long, and if you die you restart all over again, no checkpoints. Early on you unlock every unit, and the only way to get more is by completing specific challenges or challenge levels, which is a stupid way to increase play time and block off stronger units. The terrible controls come to fruition during boss fights. They will show an AOE area or a specific place to attack where a guy/group is standing. But since you can't easily move them and you only have a few seconds and they rapid target multiple spots, you're screwed. Not being able to select many also doesn't help with trying to stand in the area of the group heal.   In the end the terrible mobile controls, the bad game mechanic design, lack of variation, and stupid decisions about block of stronger units with challenge missions makes this game more annoying than fun.   3.5/10.",
