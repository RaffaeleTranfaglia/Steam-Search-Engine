You've been warned] Welcome to the world of Cloudberry Kingdom, or what I like to call Death Valley. You play as a hero as he has to go though hundreds of levels of pain and suffering to save the kingdom. You will encounter many hard enemies that will try to stop you. This game is endless, it's randomly generated levels could make your experience fun or hard. It's a good way in killing time when you run out of ideas to do. You could do acrade mode and try to make it past each level. Free play allows a player to choose the skill level, the size of the map, and what hero mode you wanna do. If you call yourself a hardcore gamer this is the game for you! Enjoy this insane but great game.",

Lots of players call this one a sadistic platformer, and later levels certainly are, but the platforming mechanics are solid from level to level and it's rewarding finding successful paths through the stages.  At full price I'd recommend this game, but I think any hardcore platforming enthusiast could find this entertaining and should definitely grab it next time it's on sale.",

            "review_text": "6/10  While this game might look like an insurmountable challenge from the pictures and videos, it really isn’t. It’s fun but eventually wears on you as all you really have to do to pass any level is just run and time your jumps accordingly. There is really no challenge to be had other than memorizing a particular levels jump patterns. As for the randomly generated levels, unlike a game like Rogue Legacy, the randomization hurts the overall experience. If it were designed with a more careful hand the game would have been much better as each level could have presented something unique. As you advance further you will continually see the same type of level over and over again. I would recommend only for the hardcore platformer crowd and even then I would say wait for the inevitable sale price.",
