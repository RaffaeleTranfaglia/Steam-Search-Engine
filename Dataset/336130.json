Not as hard as some of the previous ones, the second half of the game took me much less time to complete than the first, but the story is great, the puzzles feel natural, if you're a fan of WadJet or just point and click in general, get it.",

I felt like most of the puzzles in this game were too easy and I just didn't feel as connected to the characters in this story as much as I did in Gemini Rue, Technobabylon, and Primordia. But it's a fun game and is worth the money. There aren't many new good point and click adventure games out there but WJE has turned out some consistently good adventure games.",

            "review_text": "Another great point and click adventure from Wadjet Eye Games. Shardlight really excels in its setting, which places our hero in an apocalyptic world where a deadly disease ravages the non-elites. The voice cast is huge, and the backgrounds are just stellar to look at, while still retaining their old-school pixel look.  For what it's worth, I probably show up as a Key Activation for this game since I bought it through the developer during their preorder process.",

            "review_text": "Twenty years after a cataclysmic disaster leveled the city, Amy Wellard catches Green Lung and is in desperate need of a vaccine. The vaccine is rationed by a government that favours the wealthy. The poor are asked to complete dangerous jobs to earn lottery tickets and a chance to win a vaccine. You are thrown into the middle of a struggle between the Aristocracy and the Rebellion.  Wadjet Eye Games release another point and click gem. Fans of Gemini Rue and Primordia should enjoy this one. Like other Wadjet Eye titles, it's not overly difficult, but the narration, themes, characters and setting are all excellent. The post apocalyptic setting is not as impressive as Primordia, but I was still impressed with a few of the locations I had to visit. Puzzles could have been a bit more complex, though thankfully there aren't really any strange puzzles that have you clicking absolutely everything on screen in a desperate bid to progress.  I would have liked there to be some choices throughout the game, especially when the early story seems to suggest that this will be the case. Though I can understand why this didn't happen for the sake of the story the writers wanted to tell. I still think the political themes and serious tone work well though and I did play through more than once. Highly recommended for any point and click fan. If it's your first Wadjet Eye title then you may want to try out the Blackwell series first.",

The story line is top of the class, voice acting is one of the best I have ever encountered, graphics make me stop at every new screen simply to admire every single object.  I remember the evolution of Adventure gaming since the time when Leisure Suit Larry 1 was a jaw-dropping novelty, and it looks like the Wadjet Eye Games somehow managed to grasp all the diamonds and leave all the rough.",

I've described this game as if Dishonored and Fallout had a baby that happened to be a point and click adventure, with a dash of Loom and crazed death cults (played moslty for laughs) thrown in as well. Good voice acting, great art, atmospheric music, and very good game design. Very few gripes with the game, but it does stop short of being a truly amazing game. Definitely recommend for an adventure game fan.",

(Even though I'm a big fan of this kind of leisurely, point-and-click gaming.) The story doesn't exactly grab you immediately, but rather gets you gradually more involved. You start to like the lead character, Amy, more and more. By the time I found out the secret hideout and was enlisted on a 'secret mission' by the rebel leader Danton, I realized that I was really enjoying watching things unfold.  Look, I'm not saying it's absolute best game I've ever played, but it is ultimately worth it, particularly for fans of this genre.  ...  By the way, there is a *stupidly* unfair and flippant review of this game from 'Slant' floating around out there. Pretty annoying how some people are allowed to review point and click games when they clearly have a preformed bias against them.",
