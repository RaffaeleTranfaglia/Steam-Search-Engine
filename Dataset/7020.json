            "review_text": "When the chips are down and your Blue Man Group buddies are dying all around you, what do you do? Take a knife, dig it into their necks and rip out a computer chip with their brains backed up on it. Duh. Then you stick that chip into whatever piece of equipment you have handy and, hey presto, a talking gun. And backpack. And hat.  Then you put the hat on a computer and it can hack it. Your backpack can make lots of grenades and things for you. Your gun shoots stuff. Wait, no, it already did that. Now it shoots stuff while quipping one-liners. It's an action movie hero gun.  If you're not already swimming in a sea of imagined joy at the thought of all that yet, let me add a little excitement by saying that Rogue Trooper also is an excellent romp through a war-torn planet. It's definitely a console port, but a great console port, one made when developers had mastered the last generation of consoles and had reached the pinnacle of the design possibilities the tech provided for.",

            "review_text": "A 3rd person shooter with the ability to take cover and even though it might be a bit buggy sometimes, it still remains fun. And the best part about the combat is that even though you are mostly alone, the parts which you are not, the AI acutally do kill the enemy but are a bit stupid so if you don't support them they will die and even though i dose not matter, it feels more fun with allies.  The story is very intressting, you are part of a gene-modifed infatry battalion (the G.Is) which is a part of the Shouth faction and you fight the North faction but i don't want to spoil more than that you and your buddies are going to shoot alot of Northerners.  Great game if you don't care for graphics but do care for gampelay and story.",

I really expected a fun third person shooter here, but I guess we'll never know for sure.  [Rating: --/100]",
