            "review_text": "I'm usually not that much of a platformer person, but I liked the artstyle and music so much that I thought I'd give it a go. And well, the levels are very diverse in what they offer, and I'm having a blast so far. Especially the portal levels are great fun. Getting gold times is quite hard, and the game can be quite difficult as well, but if you're up for a challenge it can be very a rewarding experience :).",
