            "review_text": " An Octave Higher  is a visual novel that takes place in the fictional world of Overture where magic exists and a person's place in society depends on if/how they can use magic as well as that person's financial wealth. Imagine that the setting of this game is similar to the US in the 19th century Industral Revolution except that magic actually exists and you'll get the idea of the premise here. Basically, you play as three different characters-Frederic, Franz, and Elise-and they are rotated accordingly in the story. As this is a visual novel, choices do matter. Depending on the choices you make, you can find yourself aligned with certain characters. For example, if you play as Franz, you can make decisions that align him closer to Elise or to Aretha, Franz's friend. Also, decisions regarding whether Franz and Frederic get along determine whether more of the story becomes revealed (and thus, the true path gets told) or it ends. Although the first half of the story reveals this, the second half reveals it even more-that there is huge class disparity between the aristocracy/bourgeoisie and the proletariat-and magic plays a role in this class division. That's basically all I will say without revealing more although I will say that the true path is the most tragic so be warned.  There are a total of 6 different endings although one of those endings doesn't show up as a Steam achievement. The art is beautiful and I especially love the music in this game. I'm a huge fan of music from the classical and Romanticism eras and the selected pieces fit really well at certain moments. Of course, there is original music as well and it was equally enjoyable.   Overall, I would highly recommend this game if you're a fan of visual novels and love a good story. There isn't really any romance in this game but the story is so good that it isn't necessary. After all, all visual novels don't need to have romance to make them enjoyable. Also, I'd recommend getting the soundtracks (in DLC format), as I found the music tracks very enjoyable and soothing to listen to. I'm certainly looking forward to the prequel- One Small Fire at a Time -and hope to be able to play it in the near future. ^^",

            "review_text": "An Octave Higher is a very refreshing, different kind of visual novel. it looks pretty typical with its steampunk-fantasy setting and magical battle elements, but it doesn't end there at all. It also isn't very romance-focused, despite looking like it will be that way at first. Still, it's neat to see something with a steampunk setting that actually deals with the social and political conflicts of the time. Its handling of the topics is really high-school-level 'intro to communism,' but that still gives it stronger themes than most visual novels. Plus, it has some really engaging, well-written characters. If you can deal with it getting a little soapbox-y and the sometimes-cheesy overuse of music references, it's a lot of fun.",

A refreshing change from the usual anime style visual novels and has different endings. The art style is pretty unique since it doesn't look anime like and the music is nice, some are collection of classical music.  p.s. the mention of some of my county's traditional dishes are a funny bonus for me since some of the devs are Indonesian XD",

I was disappointed every time the narrative moved from one plotline to the next, which is a good sign. The minor characters were just as evocative and fun and distinctly voiced as the major characters.  I can imagine someone objecting to loads and loads of exposition before ever making a single choice, and then loads more before making your second choice. But the storytelling, and blend of tragic and comic, made that no objection at all to me. I would recommend this to anyone who loves great storytelling. ",

            "review_text": "Quite good music, good background art, pretty good character art. The setting is interesting and the writing is intelligent and occasionally quite witty. The story is curious - it starts off being about an unorthodox student project to fix a piano magically, then takes a left turn into bigger things going on in the world, especially in the story routes where one of the protagonists   loses his hands and casting ability with them, then organizes the proletariat to rise up and seize the magical means of production.   So uh, that escalated a bit, but it's a fun ride.  More details on the writing: It's witty. There are some innuendos and a brothel features as a story location, but no real explicit content or fanservice. There are long stretches without player choice, but there  are  meaningful choices with direct or indirect consequences. For a few minutes after the intro there's a sequence that summarizes the setting's magic system, and you do need to at least halfheartedly pay attention to it. It's not that bad.  For a negative, the devs seem to have made their own VN engine, and the controls are unorthodox and take some getting used to. Also sometimes you have to hit 'advance' three times because there are three lines of nothing but ellipses, which is a minor annoyance but not an infrequent one.",

One of those games you buy on sale and realise you would be more than happy to pay full price.

An Octave Higher is a fun little visual novel in which the choices you make determine the ending you get. Some are good, others bad, but the real ending you gotta work for it.   The music is piano set pieces, a few are from well known artists, and the hand-drawn backgrounds look beautiful and provide an atmosphere to the game. Though I wish they altered them a bit to show the passage of time. The characters might seem two-dimensional at first, but subsequent playthroughs reveal more about them than what meets the eye.  If you want a fun little visual novel to enjoy, I recommend it, especially to people who love the piano.",
