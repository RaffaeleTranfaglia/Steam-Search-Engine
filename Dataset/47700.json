I tried this game for awhile, and finagled myself into a CPU only match but it was a big hassle and the gameplay is not as satisfying as the previous titles. I do not recommend this to fans of the series. I would only buy this game if you are also a hormone fuled 12 year old looking to embarass other kids online.",

This may well be the worst game I have ever had the misfortune to play. I paid under £5 for this and it was still too much. I feel like EA should be paying us to play this. The 'always-online' that EA has a big hard-on for lately is a nightmare. The only reason I bought this was to concluce the CnC tiberium storyline and even that was terrible. Did you know there's no more tiberium in this game? Literally, it's pretty much all gone. No base building, no harvesting resources. You can train units without any cost but only up to a very, very limited unit cap. I'm talking REAL limited. Like you can only train enough units to have a decent attack force or a decent defense force. Not both. I expect that kind of limit on a console RTs but not PC.  DO NOT BUY",

They failed the developers who had built an moderately interesting fast-paced RTS game that really had nothing to do with C&amp;C and slapped the brand name on it, hoping it might sell to some hardcore C&amp;C fans. The game itself never got the chance it might have deserved, because it could never be judged on its own merits but always as 'The Conclusion to the Tiberium Saga'. They failed the fans of the previous games, because they delivered something that did not understand the value of the gameplay of all the previous titles and threw out time-honored traditions just for the sake of cleaning house. They even managed to fail the brand itself. If EA has to send out an email that ensures 'fans' that they have brought back resource harvesting, removed unit caps and similar basic fundamantals, then it is very clear that the brand itself have lost tremendous value and C&amp;C4 almost solely bears that whole responsibility. Overall this game fails, not because of what it is, but for what it sets out to be.",

The fun in C&amp;C games, because they seem not to have understood it, is to be able to build strong defenses and large bases, outposts and a solid economy ?!? With the machanics of this version, it is absolutly IMPOSSIBLE to accomplish, at all!!! This thing with the crystals to gain access to slight advantages absolutly sucks. You need to play many hours before gaining access to 50% of the units available using only boring to play and weak mech_infantry units. From my point of view, they would rather keep the unit layouts and apply the game mechanics of the provious version... At least it would be playable. What a rubbish!!! DO NOT BUY THAT, unless 1-2$, very frustrating game!!!",
