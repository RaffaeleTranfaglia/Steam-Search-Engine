            "review_text": "Written in December 2014, the game is in contant development and I expect it to be geting only better. *Year after this was written, I'm adding some comments to keep it up to date*  I wanted to start by saying it's unpolished gem, but it's not. It's a highly polished gem, fitted into cheap mass produced jevelry and wrapped in gift bag bough on discount last January. If you want realistic flying experience, don't miss it. If you want to treat yourself seriously as a simmer, you may find out-of-cockpit parts of game not dignified enough *Still mostly true, although quality of jewelry is much better*.  The good: The sim part (simulating planes and their enviroment) is very good - the game is great stick and rudder experience, the planes have mass and inertia, when flying them on the edge of flight envelope you feel them sliding from course, rather than being pushed to the side along set vector with randomized shaking added. The AI planes use the same physics as player, so they don't take breaks from reality and pretend they are jets when pressed to hard. Par the course, some people find flight models unrealistic or simply not what they expected. There are no clickable cockpits like in CloD or DCS, but after automated engine start you get to control most of plane systems (IMHO the biggest missing part is no manual fuel tank selection). To me it has the best feeling of 'being there' of all WW2 planes, but I'm stick and rudder fetishist, not clickable cockpit fetishist. There are no stability problems, unfinished plane systems of weird flight behaviour.  The bad: There are ten flyable plane types in the game (*Battle of Moscow will bring ten more, five already done, that BoS owners can meet in air even without owning BoM*). More are in the works, but because of sim part being detailed like I said above, making new planes is slow process. Do not expect to see tens of flyables soon, or variants of the same model (like all Bf-109F variants) made by small modifications of existing plane. There are *no* AI-only planes (one *has been made since review was written*) because, as they use realistic flight physics, they are not easy to make, either. You won't see tens upon tens of computer-controled planes in misisons, either, they are to CPU-hungry for that. The number of players in MP missions is limited (*much less now than year ago*) , devs still work on optimising support of more players in mission as I write. The single player part, or campaign, is something in between proper career from IL-2:1946 and mission generator - you pick stage of the battle, airfield you take off from, plane, mission type (intercept, escort, ground attack, bombing, close air support) and off you go. Missions are generated randomly with variety of weathers and targets, but they aren't as immersive as real career missions - maybe because you get no background on what your target is and why it's important beyond 'go and bomb that bridge'. There are difficulty settings in game, but in campaign you can use only two presets, normal (icons and automated engine management) and expert (realistic). Instead of adjusting realism settings before mission, you disable unrealistic aids in flight by key command (say, I bound a key that turns all engine helpers off and hit it at start of each mission, to fly with manual engine management but icons on). *The third party PWCG, a full blown career generator, is coming and already playable*.The mission editor is quite complicated so there isn't flood of user-made content and multiplayer servers - but what community made so far was of very good quality.   The ugly: The most hated part, which caused many people to give up the game as arcade: the plane modifications (bombs for fighters, bigger cannons, armoured windscreens etc) are unlockable - you get them by flying the plane in question in single player campaign. Most of these mods are non-standard, experimantal, or one-off modifications, but few are standard-issue systems that you can't accss from the start. *Owners of Premium edition - all 10 planes - can now disable the dreaded unlocks with one mouse click*. Also, the campaign includes game elements like experience and player 'level' (the higher it is, the more dangerous becomes opposition and flak fire in campaign. I suppose it is meant to make game easy for new sim players and progress as they succeed and learn). Then, you can start the mission in the air, half way towards the target, and abort it on reaxching 'exit' waypoint - takeoff and landing are optional - and on lower player levels thare is little action outside target area. So the first impression is that missions consist of going to action point, doing your job, going back. It's not the case, but you have to bother playing through simpler missions to make things more interesting. These are pointless additions to otherwise purebreed sim, and many people can't get past it - some play multiplayer only and don't want to play campaign at all, some call it pointless grinding, some are so experienced they want difficult missions from the start and give campign up as to easy before they rise their pilot level and get to difficult stuff. Make no mistake, once you sit in the cockpit you get a proper sim experience, and once you get your unlocks and rise level to get interesting missions you just have a good mission generator to play with forever, no limits - but the awards that are supposed to motivate players to play are something out of console game.  There are smaller bad decisions, like locking most of graphics options to four preset settings - you don't get to set manually drawing distance for objects or super sampling, you choose high, low, medium, ultra setting and that's it. You have manual control of resolution and antialiasing, though. It made some sense in development, but is pointless now * and has been made more workable with more options to customise your settings some time after review was written*.  All these are *were* pointless design decisions that nobody i know likes, but the developers stay by them *until they fixed them*. This stubborness earned them lot of enemity and made many people abandon the game *still true*, but I have to say dev team is very cooperative with community in most other respects, adding elements requested by players and listening to suggestions of flight model changes. There was some rush to release the game on deadline, so maybe they will replace it with something better once team catches they breath *they did*. Or not. *Or they add option to drive tanks*.",

I am seriously loving this game and with Ciffs of dover, DCS, and rise of flight all on my computer can just not tear myself away from how much I enjoy the feeling of flying and fighting with these planes.  Game's future is dependent upon the support of the community, so please think twice before shooting us all in the foot by slamming this game, as what the game lacks now it will very possibly have in the future, as long as the devs are not in the meantime driven out of business by all the negative reviews.

It's truly everything a flight sim should be. I highly recommend a HOTAS and possibly an extra control quadrant for engine controls and such.

I got the Moscow pre-release planes too - $160 within two days. Could it possibly be worth that much? What, ten or twelve bucks per flyable plane? Having spent probably something near that total figure on 777's other brilliant sim, Rise of Flight and owning all those WWI aircraft and many paid plane mods, and knowing I'd do it all again, yes, it is worth that much to an old flight simmer like me. I'll pay good money for a unique and excellent product. It's probably the closest thing so far to flying the real things, though of course that is a guess. I've never actually flown a LAG 3 but the sim just feels right. This game makes me feel very immersed and I am really enjoying it. I am doing campaigns now - great fun. I've already got half the paint schemes unlocked on three planes. Very challenging flight models, gunnery, landings, etc. Looks great - graphics are top notch. Seemingly for serious simmers, but everyone should give it a try if you love these old aircraft and the period history. Buy a decent joystick - keyboard and mouse won't do. I got the premium packages because I couldn't wait to fly all the birds. Get this game and get ready to practice your stick and rudder, as well as shooting skills. Thank you very much, 777 Studios. Flight simmers can count on you to keep the fire burning !!!",

            "review_text": "pros: fun game for flying ww2 planes flown by the luftwaffe and soviet air force in 1942-43 good campaign great graphics  very realistic very good damage model and physics can control almost everything on the plane can fly various classes of airplanes,like fighters,ground attack aircraft,bombers and i believe they will add more fun multiplayer big enough maps to fly in, honestly even taking off and flying around the map is fun in this game has various fun missions can fly around in various weather conditions and times of the day, can make a custom mission where you decide everything expert mode for even more realism where you have to manually do a lot of stuff to get the plane ready to take off developers seem to be concerned about improving the game consistently and seem to be objective (i.e not soviet fanboys) unlike some other developers. no op planes in my opinion  cons: having a good enough joystick is a must, need to spend more money just to play an already expensive game if you are not into flight simulators, more of a simulator than an arcade game(ok some people would prefer a simulator so maybe this is not a con) so it takes a long time to even learn to take off,land and fly properly(still havent perfected landing) and a long time to master and learn everything. of course it will be easier if you have something to do with aviation in real life, some of my friends are able to grasp concepts of the game much more easily because they are into aviation expensive has dlc planes that are also too expensive(seriously, cant be 30 dollars for just 1 plane) you may be better off buying il-2 cliffs of dover,looks nice enough and has as much content if you have a laptop with a dedicated and an integrated graphics card the game somehow runs with integrated graphics even though its very demanding, can manually switch that to dedicated gpu to fix it though(this may have been fixed)",

Even so, it offers the best atmosphere and realism possible in an approachable package for a reasonable amount of money. The complexity of flying is scalable, so one can just have fun shooting at other airplanes rather than spending hours upon hours learning why a BF-109 hasn't got elevator trim but a FW-190 does. However, if you do like that sort of thing, IL-2's latest iteration includes a sophisticated flight model and systems complexity nearly on par with DCS (I said NEARLY; lay off, DCS fanboys/fangirls). Since you get a whole simulator, campaign mode, and a variety of aircraft for the price of one DCS aircraft, that seems like a good deal to me.  TL;DR: pretty, pedantic, promising, pre-release.

            "review_text": "Alot of the reviews for this game state that its 'not what I had hoped for ' or 'dissapointing'. I was really worried when purchasing this but Im really glad I did. I played Il2 Cliffs of Dover casually as the game was a bit of a strain for me (the cockpits were so well detailed it actually hurt my eyes, framerate was generally not great, UI was awful) even so I expected a great deal of detail and polish in Il2 Battle of Stalingrad and it definitely has it.   In my opinion one of the most important parts of an immersive simulator are the sound effects and this game has it spot on, the engines and various other effects sound great and authentic. The graphics are quite good as well (especially the aircraft). The game itself plays very well with aircraft responding realistically to stalling and rough maneuvering. The game while not great as far as optimization goes still runs better than Cliffs of Dover and even when low in framrate still runs strangely smooth. The damage models are very detailed with basically any part of the aircraft being able to come off (I must've spent 3 hours plowing aircraft into the ground watching the wings flex and break). The UI is well designed and a staggering improvement from the one seen in Cliffs of Dover.  But there are also a few low point in the game like the lack of clickable cockpits. One of my favorite point of Cliffs of Dover was having the completely manual control of aircraft and while Battle of Stalingrad does support it with keyboard binding available I much rather have the option of clickable cockpits. The game can also get repedetive as far as the campaign goes with you generally having the same objectives dependent on which mission type you select. But even with that in consideration I still come back to Il2 daily.  I got Il2 BoS for $30 over a sale and at that price its a good deal, but at $50 im not sure I can recommend it. So wait for a sale and definitely pick it up if you have even a moderate fondness for aircraft simulators (like I do).",

Multiplayer is a blast and it takes less than 30 seconds from the time you launch the game to the time you are flying on a server. It is also deep but accessible. You can play on Normal servers with radar, tagging of planes, a HUD, and autopilot or you can play on Expert servers with none of these assists.   So why all the bad reviews? Here is a summary of the most common:  'I can't get it to work!' Read the install instructions and register online. You only have to do it once and it is the least invasive DRM on Steam.  'DLC and unlocks have no place in an unfinished flight sim.' I can't disagree, especially since the German FW190 is only available as DLC. This was the second most iconic German fighter of the war and should have been made available to all from the start. The Russian La-5 was seldom flown so that is understandable as DLC but the German offering should have been one of the two variations of the 109 Messerschmitt already in the game.   Even if you do not take part in the DLC or unlocks, IL-2 BOS has the most enjoyable online dogfights out there and is a worthwhile purchase for anyone interested in a combat flight sim.",

It's really frustrating in the beginning, so be prepared to practice these things again and again. Then there's combat. By Gum there's stone cold air aces out there, and they will flame you more than you like until you learn the rudiments of combat. I recommend trying against the AIs for a bit, till you get a bit more comfy with combat, including the fact that these aircraft can be very unforgiving on you if you abuse them. Spins will be common, and half the fun is learning how to get out of them. I find Cliffs of Dover to be a better sim in many ways, but this one is no slouch.

            "review_text": "Let me start this off by saying the game is technically finished, but still is adding and completing the game.  After signing up on IL2's website, and starting up the game I was immediately hit with a few tiny problems. One was that I have to reset the game for fullscreen to take affect, and then have to restart it again after the screen resolution was really wack. Once that was sorted I jumped into a quick mission and was thrown into the good ol' fashioned IL2 experience that veterans love and newbies will be able to grasp like their own genitalia.   First thing you'll notice menu wise is that they're very sleek, and easy to use. Unlike their usual menu's that are rather strange, buggy or just plain dull, this one is a very nice change of pace. The options are clear, the writing is slick and the essential options are big and easy to see, aswell as functional unlike the previous installment (Cliffs of Dover) where loadouts wouldnt even be selectable for some strange and unknown reason, the game has a lock beside all the modifications letting you know theyre unlockables, and not just given to you.  Gameplay wise the game has a ton of options, allowing for an easy 'Normal' or 'Expert' difficulties to be picked making it easy to start the game up for a quick match for those who just want to play, or just to differentiate where begginers and veterans should be starting off at. Most noteably out of all the gameplay options is the campaign, this is (to my knowledge) the only real flight sim that starts players off with a quick, helpful tutorial that shows players how to work the campaign mission selector and standardized mission plans. The campaign has a lot of unique features such as stats that can be viewed from the web, and a 'Full Mission' or 'Quick Mission' options that let players choose if they want to start in the air ready to go, or have to take off and land. Combat is as standard as simulators come, detailed models, realistic flight mechanics, bullet drop, all the basic stuff. The only complaints I have is that they removed click cockpit and gave us only four planes per faction (five if you wanna dish out some extra coin) that dont offer us the same depth that the planes in Cliffs of Dover did,  Visually the game is stunning, beautiful vast open landscapes that are nicely brought to life. The game really captures the battle as it was fought in the air, and on the ground. All flight sims are visually stunning in the air, focusing on cloud effects and sun effects ETC.... But Battle of Stalingrad makes an attempt to make you have a bit more of a reason to look down other than trying to bomb the crap out of the place, adding some unique smoke effects that billow out from the town which drew my attention during my long stretches back to base and actually impressed me. However, the onlu problem I have with the graphics is that there is no way to make custom graphics settings, its just four options; Ultra, High, Balanced, and Low.  Overall, the game is definitely worth a buy if you're a veteran of flight sims looking for a new one to add to your library. I do also recommend that if people are looking at getting into flight sims this is one game that can be easy to start off with, I do HIGHLY RECOMMEND that if you're getting this as your first flight sim that you buy a joystick, or you'll be key mapping for hours. For veterans I also recommend a Track IR system, it makes the game way more immersive and gives you a tactical edge when in multiplayer.  Frankly, the people who dislike this game are people who have played War Thunder and bought this on impulse. The usual complaints are that the game is not user friendly or that it has not enough playability or plane diversity. I agree that the dev's made a stupid decision to make DLC planes that are as famous as the FW190 and LA5 so expensive and DLC at all, but the planes we are given all have unique play styles and need lots of practice to even come close to mastering them, and the game is meant to be grueling and difficult as its supposed to be simulating. The planes we have are all very nice and fun to use and although there arent as many as we would probably like, its a quality over quantity type deal. ",

I found this so much easier to get into compared to Cliffs of Dover and Rise of Flight (both of which are stunning in their own way, but which seem more unforgiving). I've enjoyed the progression through the missions as it has helped me get to grips with the planes. You can really feel the love and hours that have gone into this simulation. Well done, developers.   10/10 would be shot down again",

I ran a squadron for 8 years on the old Ubi lobbies through the whole series. I bought Cliffs of dover, and never before had i felt so saddened at how unfinished it seemed to be. I really felt for the developers because it always showed in the past how committed and helpful to the IL2 players they were. IL2 Clod was so disjointed that i put off buying IL2 BoS for a long time. But let me tell you this. I beleive IL2 is now the Sim that Oleg was dreaming of. Its great in this release, and i really feel like, theres no way i could go back to 1946 after having a go of this. I thought i had seen this series die, however now it has been resurrected. Sure i understand some peoples comments about lack of aircraft, however, the detail and damage modelling is tremendous compared to 1946 which i will say, does seem very arcade like in comparison. It would be beutiful to have all theaters, Pacific carrier landings and everything you had in 1946, yes that will be missed. Maybe one day Oleg will add all this in DLC, that would be the next dream. Its a great engine this time. Smooth, and polished way beyond what Clod was. The immersion in this sim on full real settings is superb.",

It feels more like a grind to unlock future missions and equipment. But by far my biggest complaint is the fact that I cant change the difficulty settings in the campain mode besides normal and expert presets. This basically makes the campaign worthless to me becasue of my old joystick and lack of formal pilot training. Please, team at 1C, tell me why you only make games for a niche audience when all you need to do to open it up to a wider audience is to unlock the stupid settings that are already in the game for the quick missions? I understand that this was done for some unknown reason due to multiplayer, but everything I've read tells me the multi crowd hates this as much as I do, albeit for different reasons.   So, bottom line, dont buy this game unless you have a state of the art joystick and are REALLY REALLY into flight sims, oh and you have a pilots license, because otherwise it's just not fun AT ALL!!!",

Do they really think that guys play simultator for unlocks? Who ever decide this needs to be out of job ASAP - in plane writing is in russian, at least for russian planes, and some may consider this to be realistic, but let me remind you that even on captured planes or planes used by other nations, pilots would have stickers with labels, so they should add that also . - some say the fly models are good but in fact it is so much worse then IL2-CoD... in fact fly models are really close to the WT, you don't have the feeling that you produce drag when you manuver like you have in IL2-CoD, EoF or DCS. Who ever tells you that FM are good, clearly never played a good fly sim.   On the good side, - there is good graphics, - sounds are good, not sure if CoD lv or not, but good - some hidden lv editor that is not visible in the main menu/submenus, I guess we should be thankfull for that at least.

Now, I didn't go into a flight simulator expecting to be an ace pilot on day one, but I did expect some kind of help or instructional tutorial to help me get off the ground and find my way around the game comfortably. The problem is; I didn't get that. What I got instead was an admittedly beautiful simulator but with comically hillarious levels of poor design from the developers in term of greeting new players.   Also, before you direct me to the Youtube guides, I say this: Why are such tutorials not built into the game? Hm? Why have the developers who have created a bloody FLIGHT SIMULATOR not given instructions for new players? Am I expected to keep tabbing out to check a video mid-game just to have a basic understanding on how to take off? I'll pass on that, thank you.  I think as a rule of thumb now that I'll be instantly refunding games that lack sufficient effort in the area of assisting new players into the controls, gameplay, environment, etc. It's just ridiculous. You make a game with so much complexity but then skimp out on the instructional aspects? Hell, even a game with thousands of key-bindings like ARMA has tutorials! What's your excuse, IL-2?   If I stick to it then yes, maybe I could be comfortable at some point in time playing this game. My point however, is that any game worth it's salt should assist new players in doing this. If not, then your playerbase is going to die off or at the very least, be tiny in size. This was actually somewhat evident, since online for this game is pretty barren (Or seemed that way when I was on).  So, no. I don't recommend buying this game. Maybe, MAYBE if it's on sale. At full price though? Given the frustration aspect and giant learning curve with no assistance? No. I'm refunding this instantly.",
