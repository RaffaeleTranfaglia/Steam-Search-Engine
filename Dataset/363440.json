            "review_text": "I wish Steam had 'mixed reccomendation' option, if they had one I would use it for this review. I got this game because I would like to play Mega Man on the PC. This game includes MM 1-6, tons of media, Challenge mode (its basicaly a bunch of time trials) and music from the games. The games are also in 1080p.  All the games are EXACTLY the same as they were on the NES. The good thing about that is: the Pause glitch in the Yellow Devil boss is still there. The bad thing about that is: has the same slowdowns the NES had to deal with. You don't have the option to turn if off either. This makes Mega Man 3 harder than it needs to be.  The deal you are seeing here isn't bad, the Mega Man Aniversary Collection was $40 when it came out. This collection has less content but is $15. So comparing what you'll get in each this ain't a terrible idea (by the way, they don't even market MM: Aniversary Colection anymore. EDIT: The Aniversary Collection was only released in America and Japan got an alternative; countries like Europe never recived a Mega Man collection of the classic series, so I'm guessing they are happy getting this). The fact that you don't get 7-10 can be considered a downer.   Other issues I had with this game is that the game may be a bit unresponsive; or maybe that was just me. Anyways for a game like Mega Man you are constantly jumping, moving and shooting; this makes the game harder than it used to be (although I have heard of possible fixes for that). I have had only 1 crash so far, it happened while I was looking at the leaderboards. The last issue I has with this game is that you only get 1 save per game, not a huge issue but it would be nice to have extras if you mess up on the only save slot you got.  Now if you have never played Mega Man before or you are a die hard fan of Mega Man, who would like or wouldn't mind the best representation of the classics, I would reccomend this game to you. If you are neither of those ignore this game completely and get one of the Mega Man alternatives on steam (NOTE: Would recommend 20XX, not MN9).",

            "review_text": "First things first. I LOVE MEGA MAN. But I will come out and say right off the bat, that if you are not a die hard Mega Man fan, do not purchase this game.   My experience with this game has been very mixed. The games themselves play like they have for years with no differences. The 'remixes', however, are a hot mess. You will find yourself doing the same task over and over again and get pretty bored pretty quick. (I'm looking at you hovering thingies on Guts Man's stage.) There are too many other flaws in the new features that I can only explain as 'Capcom being lazy.'  My final thoughts: Our blue bomber deserves better than this collection.  ***EDIT*** I recently found out that this game was created by only a handful of people at Digital Eclipse. For only a handful of developers this game FAR exceeds my expectations. I am very happy to see that there are some at Capcom who still believe in Mega Man. I would love to support them by purchasing this collection on every platform.",

            "review_text": "A nice little addition to any Megaman fan's library. I'll get the one nitpick out of the way first: There seems to be a very bad crashing problem when viewing the Leaderboards after accessing them straight away from completing a challenge. Encountered a crashing problem while starting up the game, but was remedied by restarting Steam.   Onto the actual gameplay: As far as I can tell, the controls are the exact same and behave the same as the cartridges I have sitting here right next to me. Most of the input lag that people are experiencing may be first-timers or people who have seemed to forget that there are little silly control mechanics embedded in these games. Like in Megaman 4, while in water you cannot jump out of a slide. In Megaman 6, you cannot jump out of a slide at all. Megaman 3 has awful lag issues, but it's always had that, It can also eat you jump/megabuster if you press the button slightly before picking up a weapon energy or life capsule. Say in Shadowman's stage, when you have to cross the ravine with the parachute bots coming from above, if you jump at the same time you kill them (say with Magnet Missle) and they drop a weapon energy that you then run into, it will eat your jump input and you will fall into the death pit.   It's just small things that some of us tend to forget after 20+ years of not playing these games.  I have played around with challenge modes for a few hours, and they're an enjoyable little addition. Great to hone in on your platforming skills. I have also completed all 6 games start to finish and I cannot distinguish any greatly disparaging differences from the original titles. They play 99% the same.  I do not think the $15 price point is steep at all, considering the original games can cost you anywhere from the $15 itself, to upwards of $60 depending on where you look.  Pick it up, and fight for everlasting peace!",

I would encourage newcomers to start out with Megaman 2, as that game is a little easier than the others. BUT most people consider that game their favorite.  My favorite is Megaman 3. It's the longest one in the series, and it's the one that is filled with the most surprises. The bosses and music in MM3 are also my favorite.  An added bonus are the 'challenges' that they've added to the game. I haven't tried them yet, but I see that there are about 50 new challenges.   Can't go wrong with this purchase.",

I bought it without question and immediately thought of my friend. I love the Challenge Mode and found myself gaining more and more familiarity with beloved stages and gaining some for levels I had yet to play. As of today, I beat Mega Man 2 and then Mega Man and have not yet lost entheusiasm for playing this collection. Honestly, I was never really That good at Mega Man. I have only ever (until now) beaten Mega Man X (SNES) and Mega Man 2 (GB). Most of my experience had been just watching. Even though the screen glitches when too much junk is on it, I was brought back to the old NES days, and somehow became more than a watcher. The Challenges made me step up my game and it paid off for actual games in the collection. I am prepared to recommend this at the slightest suggestion of Mega Man, NES, the color blue, robots, power pellets or weapons. Buy this. Play this. Share this.  As far as the actual game goes, it's a collection of old NES Mega Man games. The graphics are the same, the playstyle is the same, the memories are the same. If you've played any of the older games, you'll know what you're in for. The biggest addition has to be Challenge Mode...which I mentioned way too much already. If you don't want to plug in your Nintendo to play Mega Man, or use an emulator, this is a great package of the first 6 Mega Man games for you to play any time you want on your PC. The games aren't easy now, but they weren't back then either.",

First off, it contains all the Mega Man games released on NES 1-6, this isn't as big a selection as say the anniversary collection which had 1 through 8, but the thing is... The emulation here is absolutely perfect, it's spot on, 1:1.  Most Mega Man ports up until now have had rather shoddy emulation with issues like inconsistant slowdown as well as eating up inputs. This port has none of that, it all works just as it did on NES, slowdown, sprite-flickering and all. Although this shows how amazing the eclispe engine is, it would be great if slowdown and sprite-flickering could be turned on and off like in Mega Man 9, this is a very small gripe though.  The challenge mode is also a great bonus for this collection, it adds fresh, challenging gameplay for veterans while giving new players even more content than what's already here. It would have been nice though if some of it was more original, say with original level design akin to Mega Man: the Wily Wars, speaking of which, the Wily Tower would have been an amazing addition to this collection, or even a mode like the Wily Tower, allowing use of power-ups throughout all the Mega Man games to challenge newly made levels especially for this collection. As this is only a collection though, it's highly understandable why this isn't part of this.  Overall this is a fantastic collection for both new and old fans alike, the emulation here is perfect and the challenge mode offers a new experience. I highly recommend this collection to anyone who loves Mega Man or wants to try it out, it's definitely worth the full price.  I give this collection a 9/10.

I was really hoping something among the lines of the original double trilogy being remade in the mm9/10 engines, but since when did capcom care about megaman eh?  -The menus are a mess to work with, and the 3DS releases are mutch easier to load and save states on, not to mention portability of the titles and (in my opinion) better controls than the default ones. Without a proper controller I find megaman games to be a bit harder.  -The added challenges are neat, as well as the scoreboards, but they didn't even do it in Powered up or Wily wars style by taking assets from the games to make a whole new stage, they just make you replay parts of the same game that were challenging. Very lazy indeed.   In my opinion, either get the 3DS releases (portability, easy savestating, but more expensive if you plan to take all the titles) or anniversary collection (a bit harder to come by, requires gamecube but muuuuutch more filled with content and games).

Any time you lose its your fault, but everything is designed so that it takes a bit of player learning in order to GET GUD. This is an excellent collection of fantastic classic games with lots of neat bonus content, with the challenge mode in particular being my favorite thanks to the leaderboards. Besides that, this collection has a section where you can just listen to each game's soundtrack, which is pretty great since this has some of the best 8bit music on the NES. Besides that, you can look at character profiles and old artwork for the games. Great collection. Great port with lots of bonus content. I highly recommend it.",

The games are brutally difficult, as they've always been, but they're still pretty fun. You don't get a purer run-n-gun game than Mega Man. They were good in their hayday, and they're good now. Plus the added challenges and bonus content make the $15 price tag a bit more palatable.  That being said, buyer beware.  Every single one of these games (and every other Mega Man game, for that matter), is avaible for free through piracy and ROMs. Not that I support that kind of thing. That's why I bought this, actually. I've always said that if a game is more than 10 years old and hasn't been released to Steam, the developers clearly don't want my money and I'll... find other ways to play it. That being said, Capcom DOES want my money, as they actually ported their old games to steam, which is something I love. I'd eat my liver if I didn't stick to my own sayings. But enough about that.  Just know these two things; this is not the only (though it is the easiest) way to get these games, and the emulation is buggy. I mean, seriously. They're basically the exact same as they were in 19XX. More than three entities on a screen? Better slow the ♥♥♥♥ down. Is it bad? Yes. Is it playable? Also yes. Although I do find it unacceptable that these games still run slow on today's machines, they play exactly as they did way back when (okay, I lied; I have played Mega Man before), which isn't necessarily a bad thing. But it isn't good either.  To make a long story short, it's Mega Man. Not much else needs to be said. The games are top notch, always have been, always will be. It's the port you need to beware of. Maybe buy it on sale.",

This is the kind of retro collection I like: The games are faithfully represented, and the controls are nice and tight (I'm using a PS4 controller via DS4 Windows). The HD upgrade has the games lookin nice and crisp, and the bevy of extras is a nice touch (soundtracks in a jukebox-type mode, art gallery and various other extras, visual filters [e.g. CRT scanlines], aspect stretching, border displays, and more).

However this collection does a good job of recreating the games from the NES with some nice features, such as the challanges and official art galleries... but here are the things that I didn't like about it.   Upon installing the game I was blasted in my headset with the loud menu music, and upn entering the game, I found no audio options at all. You need to use windows to turn down the game... Why did they not include this? Who knows.  You have the ability to save a game at any point and load a save at any time, similar to the save states in emulators or the game save on the 3DS versions of the megaman games. There is also an auto fire button that simulates those old turbo controllers. I find that while it makes the games easier, and you don't need to use them. I found myself using them anyways. I find that they make the game very easy, especially the auto fire button.  While I realize these are fairly minor annoyances and complaints, I know some people will want to know about these before buying this. The games themselves are just as you remember them, and with some extra options, you can replicate that old TV you have in your parent's basement on your computer with a filter! I don't know why these old remakes feel the need to add that in to be honest... but reguardless. The jump n' and shoot n' are still there.   To sum it all up... It's Megaman... again.

My reasoning for purchasing this however is i wish to show support to hopefully get some more of the blue bombers games on steam most notably the legends series.
