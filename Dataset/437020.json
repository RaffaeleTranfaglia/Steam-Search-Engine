The simple yet beautiful artstyle, music, many interesting weapon power-ups (you can try many crazy combinations), bosses and well-drawn characters really makes it unique!  In short, great shmup for newcomers since it is very pleasant to the eyes, but challenging enough for veterans too thanks to its many difficulty levels!",
