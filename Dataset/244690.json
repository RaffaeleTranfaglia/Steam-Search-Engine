            "review_text": "Face Noir is a old school point anc click game done right. The theme and scenario as you can guess is a Noir Detective placed in the New York from the 1930s. Decent lenght, nice story, lots of backgrounds the low points from this are the mainly for me the lip sinc animations that are uncanny awkward, and a personnal nitpick are some of the puzzles are too ''Myst'' like, rearrange puzzles that you have almost no clues for its complition. Regardless these, I have to say that I enjoyed very much playing this game. The main protagonist is vey likeable and the whole plot work just fine. Face Noir alongeside many other are prrof that point and click were never dead.",

The puzzles are logical and entertaining, and they are not frustratingly difficult. I would really recommend this game for fans of puzzle/pnc games and PI stories.  Story 9/10 Atmosphere 10/10 Humor 9/10 Music 10/10 Voice Acting 9/10 Graphics 8/10 (it looks surpisingly good. though the screen resolution is limited and lip synch is non-existent)  Overall: I would say a solid 9 out of 10. I really look forward to the sequel.",

            "review_text": "'Dannazionne!' this is one fantastic game!  Mind you, this is more of a sci-fi noir game, there will be a few twists towards the middle that will have you doing a double-take. But trust me, the game is pretty good for what it is.  It's a little slow to start and it's difficult to grasp the story at times since there are so many characters and side stories to keep track of and there are intervals throughout the game that calls for 'rewinds' and 'fast forwards' in time to portray other perspectives.  However, what sets this game apart from other noir-themed games, is that this is a point &amp; click game - which means it's going to be story heavy and less on the action side, which I personally enjoyed; also, you will be able to pick locks and solve puzzles (some of which can be maddening at times, but they're a delightful addition).  You do get to interview various characters and while there aren't necessarily any consequences for your choices, you might miss out on some details of the story if you don't ask the questions in a certain way or if you're too rough.   My outlook on the game is mostly positive but I do have a few complaints.  There are a few plot holes, things that aren't explained; and, there's a cliffhanger at the end that leaves room for a supposed sequel - and I do hope that it is completed and released soon because I want to know more about the story!  And, it's a bit frustrating that you have the option to skip lock-picking if it's too challenging, but you can't skip puzzles - I felt that option should've been balanced.  If you're like me and craving the noir genre, I do recommend this game.",

Ultimately, the poorly thought out 'cliffhanger' ending makes this at best a 3/5 for me.",
