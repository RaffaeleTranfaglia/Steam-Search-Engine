            "review_text": "Once you get all the achievements, you pretty much have to write a review, am I right? I mean, I want to be a good mans to the developer, who totally rocked it with this one.  Anyway, Dungeonmans is a great roguelike with a good sense of humor that I found quite charming. The name of the game is used as a point of humor throughout, so basically any phrase that would end in 'man' or 'men' becomes 'mans' instead   (Mans-at-Arms, Lizardmans, Necromanser, Lady Dungeonmans, etc). Also on the subject of humor, one of the pictures on the store page shows the 'Beeholder' enemy, which fights like a D&amp;D Beholder but spawns bee-type enemies to fight you when it dies.    If there's one thing I can't stop thinking about this game, it's that it feels like a really well-designed experience. Some people may say it feels simplified, but this is definitely a 'less is more' type of thing. I've played ToME and DCSS, and those are fun, but this game has a much tighter scope in my opinion. The graphics certainly don't hurt, either.  It's got a good system of turn-based movement and combat, pretty standard stuff in that regard. I felt like there was a good mix of single-target and AOE abilities that kept me using different skills almost constantly. A lot of games in this genre can fall apart once you find that one ability that trumps everything.  Also, it's fairly reasonable to think that if you play your mans well, you'll get at least decent gear and be able to really kick some butt. In all the hours I played, I never once felt like I got screwed because I needed a new weapon that just wouldn't drop, or had an enemy show up that my character wasn't at least capable of dealing with   (I know, I shouldn't have gotten arrogant and bump-fought that scrolled monster party...)    For anyone put off by the mechanic where you can pass along boosts to later generations (it actually can get extremely overpowered if you plan ahead), I would like to state that there's an achievement for clearing the game with a single mans, so that's a good challenge for those looking for the traditional roguelike one-life-to-live experience. That was my first clear of the game, which is probably why I had so many hours logged before it happened.   TL;DR:",

I'm not personally a fan of the silly style of humour, but it's not obnoxious and a few of the jokes are worth a smile at least. I'd certainly recommend it to beginners as a 'first roguelike' over something like, eg, Dungeons of Dredmor, which is graphically nicer but has a less streamlined interface.",

            "review_text": "SUMMARY: A humorous, sprawling, fun, .complex, and deep roguelike game with a persistent world , plenty of player customization, and great replayability/continuing play. Dungeonmans is a must-buy for fans of RPGs, Roguelikes, and fantasy.   I've played this game through from Early Access (ver 1.5.1 to be precise) to Full Release (ver 1.02), so I can comment both on the game and it's evolution. The short form is 'it's great and a lot of fun and you should buy it,' but to really appreciate Dungeonmans, you have to go into the details - because there's so much to it, and all the elements come together to make something truly special.  Dungeonmans is a mix of Roguelike, mild setting building, character improvement, and humor that's quite enjoyable and good-natured, while taking some real planning and tactics.  Start an academy, go forth as a Dungeonmans (the term is gender-neutral) of a given class. Find loot, bring back artifacts, improve the academy, die horribly, come back as someone else, and venture on. Much like Rogue Legacy and similar games as you adventure you find things that improve things for future characters - in this case the academy, your starting character's equipment and knowledge. Books improve the library, equipment improves the alchemy lab, knowledge improves the museum, leftover equipment lets the blacksmith make new things, and so on. Sure your character may die, but their legacy lives on (and dies on as you burn through characters). High-level characters that die can come back as teaching ghosts and characters can retire to teach or do other things.  Character building presents you with plenty of choices. You can start with a premade class or customize from the start with a general Dungeonmans class. Pick the skills you want to learn and build, and develop your own playstyle. My personal favorite is a kind of arcane archer, but maybe you'll favor a heavily armored necromancer, a dual-wileding trickster who creates duplicates, or a warrior armed with magical banners. There's plenty of fun strategies you can come up with depending on playstyle.  Improving the academy and towns, finding resources, and more enhances the chance of current and future Dungeonmans to live longer, venture further, and perhaps unlock the mystery of the game. Strategic choices, management, and thoughts of the next student really weigh on your mind. Take a special weapon knowing it may end up collecting dust with your corpse - or that it may let you survive. Melt down enough gear to build upgrades or sell it for cash (and knowing a future Dungeonmans can buy it later)? Options once chosen affect the game later.  There's enchanting of items as well - though unless you spend the resources to do it specifically with Upgrade Hammers (that can break overpowered items), it's random. Still, with a few scrolls and luck (or blowing a lot of resources recovered from old weapons) you can craft some enjoyably insane stuff. Want a sword that freezes people in place and sets them on fire? A suit of armor that resists, well, everything? Go ahead and make it - or use a Solvent scroll to start over. You can even find blueprints to make special items if you have the resources.  Adventuring starts out as pretty straightforward adventure-battle-loot. Over time it evolves as you face more and more powerful enemies, make decisions about using artifacts and crafting items, or figure which towns to upgrade. The game never becomes too complicated, but it does ramp up in complexity over time.  Finally, there's a lot of depth to the game. Right when you think the dungeons look alike, you discover something else. A random boss gives you a chance at improvement. or death A new monster surprises you. An item you find is enjoyably bizarre and useful. Modified towns have new inventory. Character's that have passed may leave surprising legacies. Dungeonmans is packed with things to discover.  Best of all, as of this writing, the developers are actively bugfixing and improving the game. That's the kind of commitment to quality that not only makes it more fun and gives me more confidence, but speaks to the level of commitment to making a good game. As of this writing I'm on my third playthrough, which should give you an idea of just how fun the game is and how much is in it.  An enjoyable game with a sense of humor that delivers adventure, challenge, and surprises - all with a sense of sheer, good-natured fun. Well worth the purchase.  Also worth playing through twice. At least.",

Lots of content to explore, close calls.. nice combat effects and good humour and friendly fire!..found out the hard way when I accidently selected my own character and obliterated myself..at level 7 ..oh the pain.  Few beginner Tips (learnt the hard way) -  Make sure you stack up on healing / lesser champion potions at the towns. Take note of the difficulty of the area in the overworld your exploring (top of the map) trivial - mundane - dangerous, you dont want to be exploring the overworld and have a random dangerous battle appear that you cant avoid. Apply enchantments to your armour and weapons from scrolls you attain (that are not enchanted already). Dont forget to hand in all your legendary artifcats / books and battle skills to the headmaster and then spend you skill points. Use scrolls to escape dangerous situations or spikes to block doors to run away (especially from them white rabbits) Enemy champions are highlighted by a glowing red. Until your powerful enough dont take on hall of champions, monster party portals that will randomly appear, portal of hives however, is a great boost if you have the money.  There are many more I could offer but just go purchase the game and find out for yourself, definitely recommend this especially when on sale!. ",

The Academy, a persistent base for your heroes built on previous characters blood and sweat, is a clever idea to lend depth to world and new heroes. It adds the extra dimension of trying to set up a solid legacy with a new hero while still playing as your old character. Will Fredrick the Rangermans surpass the great level 12 Wizardman, Fizban? Or will he die at level two because you weren't watching your stamina and couldn't jump away?  Beginning a fresh game can be tough when you have no legacy. Its part of the game to overcome this, stick with it! That being said, the game is quite simple to pick up and play, and skills are not convoluted with text.   The main thing that will get you killed is your ambition to go one more floor of a dungeon rather than turn around and go home. It won't be until you open that next door that you'll realize you are in over your head.",

Great roguelike for people who want a roguish experience but also want a decent interface and a sense of progress. There's a surprising amount of character progression within its simple skill tree setup - you'll find new uses for most skills as you experiment with them, making it pretty replayable. Being able to retire level 10+ dungeonmans as a teacher to build up your academy is a great method of progression that makes previous runs really matter.  As of this review (1/14/16), its main downfall is the bugs. I put in an absurd amount of time trying to put together the perfect academy - but you can't always trust that your investments will stick. Retired teachers may randomly choose a subject that's already being taught at your academy (which means they're completely useless). My retired tavern owner disappeared without a trace.  If you give the game a try, I recommend retiring 3 or so dungeonmans, and then putting together a strong dungeonman to end the game with - instead of investing too much time trying to make the ideal academy like I did.",

You spend most of your time having no problem killing individual spawns but then suddenly a champion with about 6-8 other enemies spawns, pulls you towards it, the other block you in and you're ******. They really need to fix the balence to either make it so that the spawn behavior is more stable, not ages of easy spawns then a sudden impossible one, or they need to remove the enemy's ability to pull you towards them so at least you can flee when that happens and come back later.  The game also desperately needs to make it easier for you to exit the dungeons without having to travel between the various stairwells. Even in the first release of Diablo they realized to make town portal scrolls as common as muck, how come this lesson escaped the creators of this game? Travel is borrrrringgggg!!!!  Unfortunately the 2 problem amplify one another since the risk of overpowered swarms means that you need a proper way to offload the loot, without this you lose a lot more progress when your character gets ganked.  I'd suggest giving Rogue Legacy a try instead, similar concept albeit a platformer/dungeon crawler instead of top-down dungeon crawler. it has a more stable difficulty within individual areas though the luck element to finding new blueprints to improve your character can get frustrating.",
