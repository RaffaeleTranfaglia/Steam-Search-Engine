            "review_text": "Brainpipe came across as a first person Rez kind of game (which I love). But it's not. You don't shoot things. There's no sounds coming from objects. You just navigate through tunnels, avoiding objects and collecting glyphs. Each level has 10 to collect, but they're not mandatory to proceed to the next level. It just adds to your highscore in the end. I like the psychedelic graphics, they're done in a cool way, but that's about it. It's easy to play, but there's no real incentive to play this. There's nothing to do really, even beating other highscores isn't all that fun. Do with this what you will (which means; don't buy it).  [Rating: 53/100]",

I like it the plot line is confusning and non existant but, playing this game I don't think it really needs one I enjoy the weird colors and patterns and what-not and the sound altho they don't really match the colours its fun and weird to listen to and I like the TARDIS noise that it makes some times",

            "review_text": "Wow. That word sums up the feeling, the experience, the game...and though it may not be for everyone, I have the feeling of 'where have you been all my life', when enjoying Brainpipe. The premise is simple enough...go through ths first-person-perpective obstacle course, avoid all objects other than these heiroglyph symbols...yet it is challenging, and each playthrough feels different. The thing, though, is the visuals and the audio, as it is almost psychotropic, and even when you screw up you can feel the huge grin on your face, because the experience itself is like nothing I've seen(or heard, for that matter). I generally like runners or casual obstacle games, like 'The Collider' which is newer than this, or the runners like Race the Sun, TEC 3001 or FOTONICA, which are also newer. and all of those have somewhat 'trippy' visuals to add to the visceral feel in the games, but this has to be the king of trippy...sights and sounds dazzle you as you try to get through level 10 here and grab that heiroglyph if you can...and it certainly works for me. It probably is the kind of game to play in short spurts, as it can overwhelm the senses after a while, yet I find myself craving this game on occasion, and would caution against epileptics or folks seizure-prone playing this game. If ever there's a Brainpipe 2, however, count me in...and for two bucks you can find more potential thrills, huge grins and giddy laughter from the sensation, and reasons to play again, than for many top-dollar titles out there.",

Your character is nothing more then a circle on the screen that you move around avoiding all the diffrent obstacles and collecting the glyphs in each level to increase your score. You can activate a short slow-mo ability for those tricky parts when you need to dodge a tough series of obstacles or get a gplyh. Its a unique experience with a surreal soundtrack and audio effects to accompany it simple but oddly engaing gameplay experience.",

The game does get fairly challenging on the later levels, but there's really no mechanical depth to the game. How well you do will be determined by your twitch reflexes, or maybe your memory if you care enough about getting to the end.  Brainpipe didn't hold my attention for long, for good reason. Paying $10 for this would be a complete waste. I've played many free games that were far better, so I can't recommend this one for any amount of money.",

The speed gets faster on each level, but you can slow time for a while to avoid colisions or to get 'the illuminated glyphs'. The sound is something like a mix of our everyday sounds on different ocasions. I think it´s a very interesting game.  You can train some mechanical reflex while having fun. :) It is a bit short though.",
