            "review_text": "Metro 2033 Redux isn't just a HD re-release or a sad cash grab by the new publisher. They totally rebuilt the original metro 2033 and vastly improved everything. The game is much more optimised and runs smoother, so if your PC could run the original you'll be able to run this without any problems despite the vastly improved graphics. The game looks and feels better, 4A games have taken full advantage of the new metro last light engine to make metro 2033 look like a 2014 release, adding improved lighting and weather effects. And also rebuilding the game technically by putting in the metro last light combat system, weapon customisation, sound effects and AI, as well as adding immersive features like wiping your gas mask to get rid of dirt or blood. the developers have also added new content such as extra levels, weapons and secret areas. One thing thet bothered me about the original is that they reused alot of the same character models, even on the main characters, this is now fixed in the redux version. character models now look more individual and unique and you are unlikely to run into the same looking character twice. overall I would recommend the upgrade. this totally feels like a new game.",

Furthermore, the game achieves it so well it becomes one of the very rare occasions  when the adaptation not only is very good but it also enhances the reading experience.  I recommend reading the book by the way, since it contains several parts not added in the videogames. Metro 2034 novel not so much, sadly.  Mature and immersive second to none.   Redux Version :  Impressive light effects, and I mean really impressive all the way along.  Same goes for the textures  And performance is hugely improved.  Movement is sometimes a bit clumsy, and that is the only flaw I find in this game.  Whereas most conversations are incredibly mature,  others are a bit 'hello-hero-of-the-game'. I find a bit of unbalance between the quality of some conversations and others. And a bit of laziness here and there regarding the conversations:  When you arrive to Polis, Yasha the kid...  Don't take this as a complaint, I think it's me getting older.  The whole journey is an unforgettable experience.",

            "review_text": "If we don't end war, war will end us. -H. G. Wells There isn't much I can say to express my feeling after I achieve the good ending. I rarely spent more than 30 hours for a single-player game. But when I do that, not only does it mean that I fully enjoy this game by its gameplay style, but also I do get attracted by some factors like plots, environment design or atmosphere etc. Metro 2033 is a game talking about what happened after nuclear war between USA and Russia. Unlike fallout series, the game focuses on telling a straight-forward story about how main character Artyom leaves home and tries to seek for help from the center of Metro and the judgments upon him or response to him from different sides while standing as innocent individual. Listening to conversation between different people is encouraged and, sometimes, will reward you some moral points. The information from those conversations would make you, a beginner like Artyom who has no idea about outer world and other people, begin to get a full picture about what’s happening around from different aspects. As a game developing plot after nuclear war, Metro 2033 does a great job create atmosphere by having different kinds of detailed environments built in each chapter, not only making you fully feel the destruction caused by the war but also preventing you from feeling repetitive as you goes through each chapter. Nothing ever beats the realistic feeling of wearing a gas mask, checking the timer from time to time and crawling your way out of stinky sewers or shifted streets, worrying about whether demons or Nazis would find you at the last moment. This game also has military-grade ammo as its currency. You collect them by searching every corner and use them while staying at a station with merchants. It’s not really that useful most of the time but it does provide few options to improve your weapon or switch to others. The difficulty is something I want to talk about. I love ranger hardcore mode so bad because it really brings a realistic feeling of survival with HUDS being removed under this difficulty. However, since it’s the hardest difficulty with survival mode, I actually feel it’s not that challenging at all especially considering that you can sneak through some chapters without shooting a bullet.(by saying that, I actually shot my way through the whole game when I did my first try under Sparta ranger hardcore and I ran out of ammo few times in different chapters.) This isn’t a complaint or showoff, but my first try which went really smooth without any stealth just made me feel like I’m not playing the hardest difficulty but the suitable difficulty for this game. Overall, Metro 2033 is really a good game to try if you’re looking for a solid single-player game with good atmosphere and realistic gameplay experience. The plot is developed well and as Artyom, you will love this short journey with those unforgettable friends who helped you through. And my friend, always remember this quote. “You reap what you sow, Artyom. Force answers force, war breeds war, and death only brings death. To break this vicious circle one must do more than just act without any thought or doubt” -Khan (Metro 2033)",

I don't even know where to begin. The art direction, the intense gameplay, the survival elements, the post-apocaliptic weaponry, level design... Metro 2033 is just barely short of a masterpiece. Except for a few minor setbacks such as weak sound design and a lack of story direction, Metro does almost everything right.   For me this is the quintessential post-apocaliptic Russia survival game. The gameplay can be extremely challenging, and the ideas behind all the the game elements were developed with great care. When I play it, it really feels like I'm deep underground trying to fight for my life against the monsters lurking in the Metro. When Artyom begins to asphixiate as his gas mask is cracked, or the filter is running out, the panic begins to set in. I can't tell you how many times my heart was filled with fear as I tried to reload while these monsters swiped at me.   You're missing out if you haven't played this game. End of story.",

This is a linear game, with a really good story and a special survival mechanic that makes you feel like everything matters.  Millitary rounds left behind by WW3 work as currency,so you should choose the guns you like from the beginning,so you can upgrade those or just keep some bullets handy to get some refitted filters for your mask, because well, you will see face to face the horrors of nuclear winter; I felt so sad when I saw a violet sun being covered by the dust on the air.  I was running away from some beasts in a tunnel, no makeshift ammo available just my precious military rounds, I was dumb enough to save my life using those, later on I almost died beacuse I didn't have anything to sale or bullets to spend on some filters.  Met a Nazi patrol in some raided station, I killed every ♥♥♥♥er just throwing knives , they thought the spirits were after them, sig hiel my ♥♥♥.  I love this game...

The game looks beautiful and it runs great, I had zero problems with it in these aspects. The game's story is linear but it has two ending which you can dictate by your actions throughout the entire game by earning 'morale points'. The atmosphere of the game is what makes it unique. This games pulls you in to this harsh world underground, and really shows you how hard of a life it is. (I played on hardcore ranger my first time.) This is especially noticable on the surface where you can only store 15 minutes of oxygen in your filters and you have to either be quick about it for scavange for more while your up there. I almost didn't finish the game as I was on the very last stretch, literally 1 minute from game end and I had less than 1 filter left. I managed but it was intense. This game is intense, that is why it is so good. It pulls you into the game, into the story and you become hooked. I would highly recommend this game if it sounds interesting. Pick this game up whenever it goes on sale if your interested you won't be let down.",

            "review_text": "Metro 2033 was an ugly game, full of bugs and game breaking glitches, but that added to its low budget charm. It was tense, gritty and immersive and had a whole lot of character. Redux makes the game beautiful, fixes those bugs and I haven't ran into a single game breaking glitch.  As someone who's beaten the original 2033 multiple times, I can say Redux is worth a shot if it's on sale. It's the same as the first game at its core but it does have numerous changes. The best changes being that the textures don't look so muddy and awful, the character models are much better and there are more than five of them this time around. Extra weapons and attachments which were in Last Light have also been added to the game, along with more songs for the soundtrack. The biggest flaw Redux has which the original does not is the stealth however. 2033 was incredibly broken when it came to stealth, enemies could spot you on the other side of a corridor if you so much as stepped an inch out of the shadows; they'd sometimes detect you when you haven't even done anything and immediately everyone within a 10 mile radius would be pumping lead into you. It was unforgiving, frustrating but it made beating every stealth section even better. To Redux's credit it tries to fix this by copying the stealth of Last Light, which has the opposite problem in that it's far too easy. You can walk right up to enemies, even bump into them, and they won't notice you until you fire, walk infront of them or are in the radius of a light source. There isn't a whole lot of challenge to being stealthy with one or two exceptions.  The difficulty is still high in every other aspect however. Gunfights on Ranger mode may as well have a leaderboard to see who can last the longest when not behind cover because it's essentially instakill. Like in the original 2033, this works wonderfully for encounters with human enemies but the game becomes unbareable when you're fighting 7 or 8 Nosalises at once, or having to deal with a bunch of Watchers where they essentially teleport to you and swipe attack. This was most noticeable in Hole Station when fighting Lurkers who have a graphical glitch where they merge into uneven floors, making it impossible to time a counter to their jump attacks. Not ashamed to admit I couldn't deal with it and dropped to a lower difficulty for the sake of my sanity.  The best part of the game remains entirely intact however. It's one of the most atmospheric games I've ever played. The Great Library is an incredibly tense and horrifying setting, if a game was made based entirely on the Depository level then it would easily rival the likes of Alien: Isolation. Librarians are one of the most terrifying enemies to deal with, and in Redux they are completely revamped aesthetically and it adds to their impact so much that it makes going back to Hole station on Ranger mode not seem so bad. The story stays quite true to the book also, of course you couldn't adapt the book entirely but it does a great job.",

My Thoughts:- nice improvement from the original metro 2033, graphics are much better although I have come across more than a few texture errors and glitches like Lurkers running half in the ground at you enemies half covered by the ground as if the floor is lower than the texture for it. The story is still awesome for this game.  Graphics:- AWESOME graphics if your PC can handle it some parts there are some graphic errors but not much to put you off the game.  Controls:- Easy and simple if your used to play FPS games although I did play this on ranger hardcore so took me a while to figure out how to use the bombs and knifes XD  Achievements:- 49 of 49 (100%) achievements earned  What Could Be Added:- A few things like voice audio setting as well as a Ranger Hardcore Achievement.

As a man of Russian decent, as a fan of good storytelling and memorable characters, as a fan of games with amazing atmosphere, beautiful locations, awe inspiring musical scores and deep rooted philisophical debates over man's fear of the unknown, the future, and the paranormal, this game is almost perfection. So many times did this game give me chills, good scares, goosebumps, and even make me tear up from time to time that I couldn't even begin to recount them all. This is game that really changes your outlook on things if you understand all that is happening.   Play this game with Russian voiceovers and English subtitles for the full effect of a post apocalyptic Russian Metro, on the Ranger Easy or Hardcore difficultes, while wearing headphones, and playing in the dark. Find the notes hidden in the game to get entries in Artyom (the protagonists') diary to get his thoughts and extra background info on the universe of Metro and to fully understand the world at large here. Scavenge and scrounge through the dark subterranean tunnels and on the murky, nuclear winter grounds of the Surface, and cherish every bullet you find. You'll feel like a survivor in the apocalypse, you'll feel like a Ranger, and you'll also uncover a story filled with mystery and intrigue, with heartfelt and some pretty effective moral dillemas along the way. Some subtle things and decisions can mean the difference between destroying an enemy or annihilating a people who only wish to come in peace.   The only negatives I associate with this game are nitpicks, and even then it's only really one which is the sometimes incorrect grammar and spelling both in subtitles and notes. The only other complaint is that your decisions don't hold any weight in the sequel, but that's more of an issue with Last Light than anything. Overall this is an amazing game, and well deserving of a 10/10 from me. I've been playing this since the original dropped in 2009, and I will continue to play it for years to come.",

            "review_text": "As a player of the orginial version of the game and a fan of the books, i have to say this version became fantastic.  The atmosphere is great and very 'book-like', so that bought me instantly. As far as horrors go i can't find a game very scary when the player is able to use guns, and as a veteran horror game player all the jumpscares were predictable to me. However just a plain sight of your surrondings (dead explorers, skeletons, lots of blood, monster coprses, spiders, ghost, mutants, demons, nazis, soviets etc.) and the fact that the story might become a possible future reality (not sure about the monsters of course) made it a prettyary game.  The game has 2 possible ways to play, first is survivor, the second is spartan. In survivor mode you depend on stealth and troughout exploration for ammo and other supplies because there aren't too many. The spartan modes provides a lot of ammo and a more classical FPS-shooter experience. Besides that there are 4 difficulty levels (normal, hardcore, ranger, ranger hardcore), so everyone should find a suitable one. I recommend ranger mode, because it gives a new, even more horrifying experience (no HUD, no hints, more damage for both sides, even less ammo), but only on second playthrough. As far as shooters go, you can choose from a wide vareity of weapons, and and all of them can be customized somehow (no visual upgrades only in effectiveness). You can carry 3 of them at the same time so you can be prepared for every occasion. Also you can have 3 types of grenades, throwing knives and a classical melee one. For the assault rifles you can choose from 2 types of weapons, standard and military grade. However the latter should be used very mindfully, because it also serves as money, you can buy new weapons, upgrades from it, but also could save you in difficult situations.  The AI is not the best. The human enemies sometimes forget to get in cover, have trouble seeing you upclose when youre in the dark, and don't try to flank you which makes your job easier. The monsters very often will treat you like the chosen one, and they only try to attack you even when you're a part of a big group, which caused me a lot of deaths, and also my teammates wasn't so eager to defend me.  The sound and the music fits well into the atmosphere, however the voiceacting is terrible. The characters have a frustrating, unnatural, farfetched russian accent in the english version which kinda murders the whole setup. Fortunately the game comes with a russian voiceover, which made the game more realistic, and a lot better. Although the russian voiceacting (with english subtitles!!) doesn't sound very good either. I don't speak russian, but still i had a much better experience like that.  Artyom, the hero.  Well unfortunately they made Artyom a silent hero, he never speaks in game, you can only hear his thoughts at loading screens, or read them via collectibles. This silence makes a lot of cutscene stupid, and unenjoyable. In my opinon the developers could've make him a talkin character, because,they had every information about him from the books, he had a fix personality. At least they put 51 collectable diary pages in the game (this is new in Redux version) which shines more light about Artyom and story. The story is great in general, but if you haven't read the book, you might not understand everything. That, the poster and the book copies in the game suggets you to buy it. This is a little forced advertisment, but it's only natural in a book based game, and well both of the books are great, so i suggest you to do the same.  The game is fairly long, and can be played over and over again, since it provides the mentioned two game modes, has a lot of achivements, and in the Redux version they made some more new areas that could be explored and some safes that could be opened if you find the proper keys, and of course the diary pages, they all worth to collect and read.  It's important to note that the game is not a sandbox, it leads you through in a big tunnel, but the great atmosphere, the events, and the action makes you almost forget that. However, i think they should've made the visitable stations bigger and more exploreable, because they feel packed and unlife-like (given the current situation).  The graphics became great, and more creepy than before, the developers seems to fixed all the game breaking and frustrating bugs. Most of the achievements are easy to complete based on killing different types and number of enemies with different guns or methods, but there are some challenging ones also, even mission based. They can be completed to 100% in 2 playthroughs and some additional chapter selectin, but to achieve that you have to be extremly mindful for everything becasue of the 'Enlightned' achievement, which is based on finding and triggering every flashbacks of Artyom's past, and additionaly making generous decisions all game long.   All in all it's a great game and recommended for everyone who is intrested in some horror based fps action with great story. Still enjoyable for those who haven't read the books. The redux version also provides a lot of new experience for players who only played the original game.",

            "review_text": "If you have not played any of the Metro games, now is the time. THIS IS A MUST PLAY! The Creepy, immersive, haunting and unsettling atmosphere is what really makes Metro shine. You take control of Artyom, a young ranger that is given a quest to go through the horrors of the Moscow metro system to Polis to warn the people of a danger that could mean the extintion of the remaining human race.   The game does an amazing job at setting the tone, feel and atmosphere of nuclear post-apocalyptic Russia and fully immersing the player in it enviorments backed up with some of the best visuals to date, powered by the 4A engine. Metro 2033 is best played on hardcore ranger mode (hardest difficulty) in the dark with a good pair of headphones to get the full experience.   Having played the original Metro 2033, the Redux is a serious upgrade to enhance the Metro expeirence with a few minor hiccups which I hope with be fixed with updates and later installments. Metro 2033 Redux is the same game as the original but remade in Last Lights engine. Most notable changes are the controls and how you as the player take control of Artyom. The controls in the original were clunky and somewhat frustrating but now are fluid and responisive. Another notable change are the visuals which are a mix of highs and lows (mostly highs). The graphical videlity of the enviorments and character models are some of the best I have ever seen in a video game, though compared to the original, some enviroments look too clean to be in a post-apocalytic setting and can be a little distracting at times.   Metro also does a great job of making the player feel vunerable not just from the mutant enemies and fascist regimes, but also from the enviroment itsef, almost making you feel handicapped at times. And also giving you some legitimate scares through out the game, or at the very least getting under your skin and creeping you out.   The Russian voice acting is some of the best and REALLY makes you feel that you are in post-apocalyptic Russia, how ever the english voice acting isn't nearly as good but still holds up to its own.   A must play any kind of gamer, especially for those who likes horror, post-apocalyptic or first person shooters. 9.6/10",

But it feels like there is more to it. It does feel like an old game, it has some bad enemy AI when it comes to stealth and some animations dont look that great. If you can get past that then  you should be fine.

            "review_text": "This redux edition of the quintessential original game that got me into my favourite genre of post-apocalyptic, survival horror and adventure combination with FPS elements is an absolute masterpiece. Metro 2033 redux follows the story of humanity's survival, in 2033 through the eyes of an overnight turned hero, but brilliant individual Artyom. After his home station is attacked by 'dark ones', mutants unknown and misunderstood by the remnants of humanity, he sets out on a quest to save his station from the coming doom, initially told to do so after an elite Spetsnaz remnant named 'The Rangers', one of whom, the best of the order Hunter sets out to fight this threat does not return, Artyom is abruptly spruced into action. An overwhelmingly graphic, tinge and cringe worthy and at times I, a man of the military discipline cried. It touched my very soul and what it means to be human, why we exist the way we do, and why we are our own worst enemy, not the mutants, not the world, not our weapons, but OURSELVES, we destroyed everything we built, in the name of greed, righteousness and the victor. Amazingly done levels, with action sequences, spooky lone adventures and the ultimate feeling of success, however not in the light you always see it so.   9.5/10  Redux edition adds Last Light mechanics Additional graphics options that are optimized for PC Additional playthrough modes, Spartan, Ranger and Survival etc Tuned and additional weapons and game trinkets such as safe lockboxes and caches.  Would buy for full cost, and even more so on discount sales. An all round game that is one of my top 3 of all time, others being Fallout series and Metro:Last Light.",

            "review_text": "Game has a nice flow to it. A good single player experience to get lost in for a little while, if you can find it for $10-$15 I would say jump on it. I got it on sale bundled with Last Light for like $7 a piece.  Its gun play isn't bad compared to even more modern games. But we are getting to be a bit spoiled there. The graphics are pretty good, it runs decent enough, but prolly not for low-end rigs.  The story is pretty good. The weapons are decent enough, though I feel could have had a better selection. The enemies are kinda cool, the monsters are alright.  The thing that really shines in this game is the atmosphere. The use of setting, music, mood. They did a good job in that department. I really liked traversing in this game. It doesn't hold your hand to tell you where to go all the time, and there is a decent amount of hidden goodies all over the place. I find it refreshing that it doesn't have some neon blinking arrow pointing at the objective or where you need to go all the time. (or some alternative of that most games now-a-days have in abundance)  There isn't a ton of repetition in level design, but you can see it every now and then. I think there are moral moments in the game that you choose to do something, or not, but I am not sure what it really effects. Unless the game has multiple endings. Which I am not sure if it does.  The music is pretty good to. I have had my girlfriend, and my best friend both tell me that they like hearing the music coming out of my room when I play this game. The game does some things just right. Kinda like 'Singularity' did. It isn't the best, but its atleast worth giving a shot.  I played it on hard difficulty, and that is what I would recommend as well. It's pretty challenging, but not ridiculous. Ammo can become scarce if you don't search for it, and conserve. I was running into Air issues for my gasmask (I like to explore) but I made it through the game relatively well considering.   One thing that I think this game could use that it had no shred of is boss fights. A game like this could have 3, maybe 4 mini bosses, and 1 final boss. No such thing in this game.   I would recommend having some what of a decent rig if you decide to play it. The length isn't all that long, but it isn't all that short either, its a decent middle length, it could of went longer if it included the boss fights that I mentioned above.  I will be playing the second game Last Light. I hear it was good too.   Some complaints on the game is It is sometimes hard to make out what the other characters in the game are saying. Mainly when you, and they are wearing gas masks, plus the accents. Which I have to point out that you can clearly hear that the accents for some of the people in the game were horrible to the point of being kinda funny. Namely the Nazi/germans. That was funny. Another complaint is the nightvision goggles in the game aren't calibrated enough, most of the dark places have a few lights in them that make the NVGs almost useless. (they could have adjusted the filters better on it so it doesn't flare as bad constantly) The Night Vision Scope (IR scope as they call it) doesn't suffer from this issue. It also crashes kinda easily. There a few areas where picking up a set of Air tanks for gas masks, and medipack off of a table in the later half of the game crashed the game for me every time I tried it.",

This game is basically meant for those with High End PCs (Yes, I mean EXTREMELY high end). There is nothing different with the story or anything besides the voice change (Which I believe the original Artyom voice was so much better than this one and Last Light's) and everything that is basically listed in the product details.

            "review_text": "Discount purchase review!  I bought this in the bundle with Metro : LL Redux for $25 thanks to a great steam sale.  I'm about half way through the game (I think) right now. I'm just after 'Defend/Child'.  Short bullets :  REALISM :   - Gas/Nightvison goggles will be damaged (comprimised vison) if you wear them in combat  - No automatic ammo pickups or reloads  - You actually might need your flashlight in this, unlike other shooters  GAMEPLAY (Good):   - Definatly not your traditional 'Run-N-Gun' game but far from boring. Two playable modes which can switch the game from it's classic 'Scavenege for bullets' and stealth preffered feel, or make it more forgiving on ammo count with 'Spartan' mode.  - Heavy scavenging aspect, good if you're into looting every enemy you kill and searching for ammo ect.  - Many different ways to stealth through enemy blockades, or just attempt to gun every enemy down if you have enough bullets  BAD :   - Weak human A.I , Monsters are ok but they generally just swarm you anyways  - Not so good level progession when it requires you to perform a specific action but you receive no instruction or hint from the game on what to do (Read below)  - Forced Night Vision Goggles mode (bug? Read below)  Upon entering that game, I noticed it was FAR different from any other shooter I've played. It does have some focus on realism. Putting on a Gas mask to avoid radiation, a game where you actually need your flashlight, No automatic reload, wiping blood off of said gas mask, no automatic ammo pickups, ect. It has a pretty high scavenging and looting feel to it, if you like searching every body, and looting safes you'll like the scavenging aspect to this. The graphics are super intense I was suprised to find out that I actually couldn't run it at 'Very High' setting because it was too much for my graphics card, but It looks amazing in that mode if you have strong enough specs.  This is definatly not a run-n-gun game, but fear not, it's far from boring. You CAN run-n-gun if you choose to play in the new 'Spartan' mode, which makes ammo pretty common. But from what I hear in the normal mode ammo is more scarce and stealth is preffered. Speaking of the stealth system, it's pretty nice. Stay in the shadows, don't walk on any broken glass and avoid tripwire traps ect. You can stealthily take out enemies, or blow out the candles and sneak past them. However there is a downfall, the A.I are increadibly horrible at detecting you while you're not shooting at them. I crouched behind one Nazi gaurd and attempted to knock him out only to realize too late that he had full body armor on and I wouldn't be able to. He turned around with his flash light right in my face and shouted 'Who goes there?!' I froze, I was practically kissing him but he didn't 'notice' me. After a tense staring contest he soon mumbled somthing about seeing shadows and casually pushed me (no really, the game phsyically pushed me out of his way) and continued to walk past me. Now yes, this was in 'Spartan/Normal' mode (Easy) but I mean come on, he should have detected me.  Another thing I don't like is how the game just completetly leaves you to figure almost everything out on your own. I (like many others) had NO IDEA what to do when first following Khan and arriving in the train car full of impassable cobwebs. He just stood there and didn't tell me what to do. I thought that the game bugged and failed to load a script and rebooted it several times until finally watching a walkthrough on Youtube and finding out that you had to press M and take out your lighter and burn the cobwebs. The reason this is confusing is because you walk through TONS of other cobwebs throughout the game without needing to burn them, then suddently arrive at some that you MUST burn to pass but receiving no instruction or hint to do so. Litterally, Khan doesn't say ANYTHING when you get to this part. He just stands there and stares through the webs.  Finally, I don't even know if this is a bug or not but, there are times when after you collect the night vision goggles you'll be FORCED to wear them durring some parts of the game. And no, not parts where they're usefull, infact quite the opposite. This is the whole reason I decided to write this review. This is absolutly rediculous. At some specific parts of the game, your character will put his NVG's on and you won't be able to take them off. I first encounted this durring the 'Trolly Fight' level in which you use an turret on a moving rail car and shoot at enemies. The NVGs got forced on me and I couldn't take them off for the whole level. Since the level isn't particually dark it was EXTREAMLY hard to aim at enemies because all I could see was big white blobs everywhere (fires, enemy flashlights, explosions, ect.) The NVGs are definatly NOT NEEDED in this level but the game forces you to wear them. I don't know if this is a bug or not, but I later encountered this when entering a 'town/outpost'. It once again forces me to wear the NVGs in a well lit environment making it hard to navigate. shop, ect.  All in all, I do enjoy the game for providing me with a different kind of shooter experiance sperate from Call of Duty styled shooters. ....But that NVG thing is really starting to get on my nerves!  I reccomend this game ONLY to people who do research and find out that this is not a Call of Duty type shooter. If you buy this game and expect Call of Duty action, prepare to be dissapointed. If you're looking for a shooter that isn't all about multiplayer and is a focused single player shooter with scavenging and atmosphere, try this out.",

From fighting dozens of people during an immense blizzard to fighting creatures in the depths of the Metro tunnels... the intensity is balanced nicely, giving this game an amazing vibe. When Metro begins to calm, you're thrown back into action. The best experience is when you first step outside and witness the streams of sunlight and snow resting on the chaos and destruction. Of course there are some downsides... the length was too short for my standards and the game didn't feel fully completed by the end.

            "review_text": "Metro 2033 Redux. What is this game? Why should you buy it? Read on to find out.  Based on a best selling novel of the same name, Metro 2033 'Redux' is a first-person shooter set in the ruins of post apocalyptic Moscow. You play as a young man named Artyom who, (after an unexpected event), is thrusted into a race against time to save not only his home; but the rest of Moscow as well.    The story.   The story of Metro 2033 Redux is a familiar one for those of us who've read the novel. If you have heard of this book but have not read it yet, then I suggest you do so before you play this game. Because while the story in Metro 2033 Redux is good, it's not nearly as in-depth as the source material. With that said however, you will find the story to be an excellent motivator to push you forward in your journey through the dark, decrepit, metro systems. One example is how it's told from the perspective of various characters and the environment itself. The former will mention to you how that hideous dog-like creature you just killed is just the usual 'tunnel-trash', while the former beckons you to explore it's dark, ominous interior to discover what happened here many years ago. Suffice to say, the story in this game will keep you entertained from start to finish. More so if you take it slow and don't try to rush through the game.   The gameplay    As previously mentioned, Metro 2033 Redux is a FPS (First-Person-Shooter). The 'gunplay' in this game is decent most of the time. For example, I once tried sniping an armored bandit in the head and the game registered it as a 'body-shot'. While not a common occurrence, the gameplay is the weakest point of this game. Often joked about as the love-child between the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. and F.E.A.R. franchises, Metro 2033 Redux is linear in nature. There are often only two 'paths' to take in each level: One is direct and requires you to kill most, if not all, foes around you; while the other path allows you to sneak by most of the enemies. To further solidify this, the game has two separate game-modes to choose from before you start a new game. One is called 'survival mode' where the emphasis of gameplay is stealth. While the other one is called 'spartan mode'... or as I like to call it: 'shoot anything that moves' mode. Regardless of the mode you choose, the levels will stay the same.  Unlike most FPS games however, you need to buy (or loot) the guns you want to use in this game. The interesting thing about this is the game's currency: Military bullets. You get them as you progress the story and by unlocking hidden miniature vaults scattered throughout the game. Sometimes you can also loot a small amount from enemies as well. While they are used as currency, you can also use them yourself with some of your guns. But be aware of the fact that while they can be used to kill most foes in this game very quickly, you only have so much. There are other items and tools you can buy and use in this game, but the game itself explains this well enough early on; so i'm not going to cover the rest.   Side note: For most gamers, Metro 2033 Redux will last about nine hours if you just follow the story and choose not to do anything else. At most, you're looking at about twenty-four hours worth of gameplay.   The graphics   I have to be honest here. If you're hoping to find a detailed report of how many 'frames-per-second' on the highest graphical settings that I'm able to get with this game, then i'm sorry to disappoint you. You're going to have to read another review to find out that information. What I CAN tell you is how the game looks from an aesthetic viewpoint though. From the depths of a ruined metro system, to the beautifully disturbing ruins of post apocalyptic Moscow, Metro 2033 redux is a sight to behold. Much like the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games, this game feels as though it's alive and will continue to live on long after you've completed this game. Don't get me wrong: this is no Skyrim. But I would be lying to you if I were to say that this game was lacking in the graphics department -- which it is not.   Final thoughts   This game is fun. While it isn't as good as it could have been in my opinion, Metro 2033 Redux is still greater than the sum of its parts. For the price, you're getting an exciting, memorable, albeit short experience. Of the many hours I have spent in this game, none of it felt wasted. So what are you waiting for? Go buy this game and have fun. And always remember: If It's hostile, you kill It.",

            "review_text": "Metro 2033. This was originally a book written by Russian author Dmitry Glukhovsky about the aftermath of a nuclear war that resulted in Russia being struck with numerous nuclear weapons, obliterating the surface and all life on it, leaving only the people who had fleed to the Metro stations alive. It was a neat idea, and from what I hear since I haven't read it, an excellent book. So excellent in fact, Ukrainian based developers 4A Games asked and collaborated with Glukhovsky to make a video game about it, which was released in 2010 and spawned a sequel that was released in 2013 called Metro Last Light. Both games were recently released to port them to the XB1 and PS4, however they also released it to the PC because... why not? I'll review Last Light Redux when I get around to it, but I'll review this first. So what did I think? Let's take a look.  STORY: The story follows a man named Artyom, the usual silent protagonist, excluding the loading screens where he monologues about what goes on. After his home station Exhibition is attacked by a mysterious group of mutants known only as Dark Ones, a group of vaguely humanoid shadow creatures who manipulate peoples minds, Artyom is sent by the higher ups of Exhibition to Polis Station to get assistance against the Dark Ones. The game chronicles his adventure to Polis Station and the mission against the Dark Ones. What you do during that journey will affect the ending; there is a karma system that is not mentioned in the game that will decide what ending you'll get, so watch what you do, though Last Light goes with one of the endings and not the other as canon for the game, so make sure to remember that. It's an interesting journey, I didn't get bored during it at all, which is all I can ask really. One thing I wish this game went into would be the lore behind the WW3 in this universe, I hear they go into it a bit in the book, but for the gamer who is just getting into it from the game and want to know more about the universe like me, we want to know more about it. Otherwise, it's a good story.  GAMEPLAY: Shooting is nice, though if you want to get far, shooting might not be the best idea. I'd recommend stealth for the game, lethal or nonlethal doesn't particularly matter necessarily if you dont care about karma. The reason I recommend this is because ammo is pretty rare and it's best saved for when you go up against some of the mutant animals. There are also segments where you go up onto the surface, where you'll need a gas mask and air filters to be able to move around without suffocating. Air filters are a bit rare as well, in fact along with normal ammo, I ran out near the end and I had to sprint around like a madman in order to find another. High quality military rounds also double as money in this world, so if you use them you literally shoot money, but they're also more efficient in killing. Overall, it's pretty good.  GRAPHICS AND PERFORMANCE: The game looks a heck of a lot better than it did back in the original version. The surface world is breathtaking in how it looks. The metros look pretty nice as well, they got the feeling of a claustraphobic refugee camp-esque setup in some areas while others look properly abandoned and gloomy. The game plays at a decent framerate for me, though if you have a better rig than me you will be fine.  CHARACTERS AND VOICE ACTING: Artyom is voiced well enough, though you only hear him in the loading screen, which makes things kind of awkward when they ask him anything in-game and he doesn't reply. The voice acting is good enough, they actually get Russian actors instead of awkwardly throwing in actors of any other nationality, which was necessary for this game.  OVERALL THOUGHTS: The best way I can sum up this game is this: Imagine Fallout if it was more of a traditional shooter. Yeah, that's a good way to sum it up. 9/10, it's a pretty good game and I say get it if you get the chance.     If it's hostile, you kill it.   ",

            "review_text": "Metro 2033 Redux is fascinating as both a solid FPS game and a world to explore. Based on a book of the same name (which you will see at least a dozen times in a single playthrough) it feels very well fleshed out in comparison to other post-apocalyptic games that simply seem to copy all the muted colors and dismal lighting without really capturing the atmosphere of a broken sad world void of hope.   You play the silent protagonist Artyom. The voice acting, atmosphere, graphics, movement and mechanics of the game are all very well done. Your choices affect which ending you may have and they are very subtle which is nice. Irradiated zones abound so a gas mask is required and it is one of the mechanics in the game that I initially thought was neat but then later on grew to love. Imagine a bunch of monsters are running towards you and a companion and you need to reload your weapon, while reloading you take damage so you also need to apply a med kit while struggling to avoid blows THEN once you are finally good to shoot the creatures in the face with say a modded out shotgun with laser sights, four barrels and a reload reducing stock the alarm to indicate you need to put a new filter on your gas mask (which by this time the visor is probably covered in blood) sounds and you are wise to switch it out immediately. All of this adds to a sense of chaotic and tense combat which I found way more fun than your typical shooter.   The monsters in Metro are probably the biggest letdown followed closely by sound effects for the weapons and the occasional frame rate drops. The monsters are variations of different sized mutants ranging from dog to ape sizes and are largely forgettable and annoying to kill due to high and unpredictable movement speed. the late game offers a bit of monster variation but its too little too late. Sound effects for the guns make them sound very weak which combined with the aforementioned monsters makes combat annoying at times. Lastly a couple spots in the game involving water or lots of particles effects, especially in the late game induces horrendous frame drop issues.   The good far outweighs the bad here. If you enjoy FPS's as well as story rich fleshed out worlds do not hesitate to buy (with money not ammo) this game.",

            "review_text": "One thing I love, is shooting games. FPS in particular. I like shooters even if it isn't very plot heavy. I just love to shoot things. However, this FPS action-adventure-survival taught me how to truly love and respect those people who can make shooters that, despite their many counterparts, can bring something new to the party. As of the date of this review, those people who brought this thing to the party of gaming, have officialy earned themeselves the title of making what is now my favorite game.  Developer and Developer History: You can read who the developer and publisher was on the steam page. So I will not bore you with something that can easily be looked up. However, it needs to be known that this game was originally adapted from a book series also called Metro by Dmitri Glukovsky. Not only that, but he actually took part in the development of the Metro game series which is cool because the man. the maker, the magnificent, has given the game version his stamp of approval unlike some other games and their authors (I'm looking at you, Witcher). Also, during development, 4A has never made any other games and this game was not incredibly known at the time of its release and did not receive much hype at the time. SO for a studio's first game to be a big hit and spark a huge cult following, is pretty impressive.  Plot: One thing that I sometimes hate about games, is their attempt to add too much depth to the plot to where it becomes too confusing (eg. finding out you were fighting for the bad guys, deux ex machina moments with rediculous explanations, etc). However, this game kept it simple. You are fighting for the good guys, and trying to defeat the bad and restore order and peace despite your calm life before your involvment with the different Metros. Also, I love how explicit important parts of the story were made. In many games, any piece of information is usually implicitly stated and 'represents' something. That is not a bad thing, but making details so ambiguous can cause hard-headed and naive people like me to have important details slip over their heads. So when this game reiterates an important piece of information via mission intro or diary entry in an obvious manner, it refreshes me on what has happened and what our goal is without confusing me. (As a side note, I personally love the addition of supernatural entities to add horror and supernatural elements to the mix as I have an interest in the Paranormal).  Characters: The variety of characters in this game, whew. You do not just fight mutants. You fight humans, your inner demons, ghosts. You do not just get along with humans, you get along with mutants and any mutant or person can become your worst enemy or your best friend in the blink of an eye. SO do, not, fully, trust, ANYONE. Eat or be eaten, kill or be killed.  Playability: I will admit, this was one of the downsides of the game. You cannot change computer volume in game so you have to use the volume slider built in the game. Also, if you're like me and change your controls often, you might want to leave defaults because certain combinations can make some aspects of the game unplayable (eg. Reloading BB gun air wont work without defaults). However, these aspects of the game can easily get used to within the first hour of playing.  Difficulty: One think I love about this game is it can satisfy those who love horror and survival games and who scavenge often, while also allowing the option to satisfy those who like to go all out Call of Duty style. These options are given in the Spartan and Survival options provided at the beginning of the game to make ammo more plentiful, equipment more abundant, etc. Also, after selecting your play style, you are then given the option to choose your difficulty which I see to be pretty balanced.  Mechanics: For the time that the game was made, these mechanics were not seen often amongst shooters. The gas masks, the guns, the movement, the agility, the endurance, the health systen, the guns' mechanisms, and how they performed were very new for its time and very unique which made me enjoy it even more when I shot somebody...or something. But you are also allowed to spare people's and mutants' lives from time to time aswell so there is that. However, one aspect I didn't like too much was the moral points system. Now I'm not saying that since on both games I was apparently a huge enough ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to not be given the opportunity to pick any good ending but because I do not think your actions early on in the game should justify what actions you take in the ending of both games because to me, what ending I choose or want at the end of the game, does not and, imo, should not coincide with my actions earlier in the game.  Graphics: To put it simply, the graphics were quite stunning for being made in 2010 when compared to other games like Left 4 Dead 2 and CS GO and other FPS shooters. However, choosing your graphics settings are quite difficult to get used to in Metro because I have a Nvidia GTX 980 with a 144hz G-Sync monitor and I had to have SS off and graphics on medium for it to even run at 60fps. I don't know about you but I never had to do that with any other game.  Immersiveness: This is, without a doubt, the most immersive first person shooter I have ever played. I usually play campaigns in intervals. After about 30 minutes I get bored and have to take a break. However, I found myself playing Metro for 3 hours and not even 1/4 way through the campaign. This is by far the most immersive FPS i have played and I never felt more significant than I have in this game and never have I hated or loved a bunch of people made of binary code or notepad more than I have in this game.  Entertainment: Immersiveness is differnet to entertainment. Immersivness deeply involves and appeals to one's senses. Entertainment refers to how amusing something is when observed. This game, at first can be hard to get into as you are not quite sure what you are supposed to be doing in this game. However, the longer you play, the more the pieces to the puzzle start to come together and the more entertaining it becomes. So, this game is as entertaining as can be to me. Not in the sense of stimulating, but in the sense of appealing to your emotions and by the game almost asking you 'how would you deal with this situation, how would you react?, how much do you want to live?' I found the atmosphere, the missions, the people you fight with and alongside, and just the moments looking back on what happened to your homeland more entertaining sometimes than the actual shooting of mutants and people. I found this game more entertaining in a movie sense more than a game sense as I loved just looking around and thinking about all that has happened to my character and what made me want to fight for the people of the Metro, and why this, in the matter of two days playing this game, made it my favorite game as of today!",

There are some iffy design choices, such as the like 6 hours in the early-mid game during which you aren't able to upgrade guns. If I hadn't gotten a silencer for my AK I would've never finished the game and this review would be a lot more negative. The Library also has some dodgy AI bits, such as Librarians just gunning straight for you and smashing your face in.

And let me also add that the fact that I even bothered to write this review, and make it so positive, just goes to show that this game is definitey worth a buy, just like its sequel, Metro: Last Light, which I am yet to play but will soon review too, if it impresses me as much as this game does",

            "review_text": "Metro 2033 Redux is a mostly linear shooter with a dark and gritty atmosphere in post-apocalyptic Moscow. Sometimes, especially during the stealth parts of the game, the game let's you choose from different paths. This game is inspired by a book written by Dmitri Alexejewitsch Gluchowski. It gets a lot of praise in the gaming community so it was a no-brainer for me to try it out sometime. They weren't wrong. It's clearly a classic.  + Nice gameplay + Immersive atmosphere + Many weapons to choose from and you can upgrade them as well. + It runs well and looks very nice on high settings. + Stealth mechanics could be better, but do their job in the end. + Memorable enemies and scenes  - I wanted to hear Russian voices, but it's not fully subbed. - I hoped to see more interaction with people that could have deepened the atmosphere even more. Also, there could be missions inside of the human colonies, too. I felt a bit disappointed by the human colonies and found myself craving for more. - I don't want to spoil anything, but there is a hidden moral point system I don't agree with because some parts of it don't make sense.   I got punished for killing bad guys.   - The FOV is rather small. Although there is no FOV slider in the settings, I have heard it's possible to change it manually in the ini file. You might want to check this out.  If you like singeplayer games with dark atmospere and some survival elements then this game is for you. I recommend buying the bundle with the sequel Metro: Last Light redux.  Replay value: Average Rating: 9/10 Recommendation: Yes",

            "review_text": "Metro 2033 is one of these wonderful creepy shoddy video games from Eastern Europe. It captures some of the ghost town existentialism that STALKER made popular, but it had quite a few problems. The stealth system, for example, was crap on toast. It didn't run very well. The way the game felt and moved had a few problems, it felt a bit like running a lap underwater. Despite all this, it had ambience and character and terror crawling out of every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ pore of its being!  So I'm happy to say Metro 2033 Redux is mostly an improvement. Well, mostly.  First of all, I'd like to lodge a complaint: The development team ignored processing instructions for older AMD and Intel CPUs, and I would like to say that is not cool at all. I've had a AMD Phenom II quad-core processor for some time now, and while it isn't the amazing powerhouse that is whatever's at the top of Tom's Hardware's CPU charts, it can still kick ♥♥♥ and take names. Developing for the PC to work with a wide, wide range of specs and hardware configurations is a pain in the ♥♥♥,  but that's still no excuse for leaving older PCs out in the cold like that!!!  Thankfully, those instructions were patched in and I finally got to play the game two days later after launch.  Second complaint: I had to replace one of the intro movies in the game directory with a blank file because it was crashing my game when I was actually able to get it running. I had to do this to a game released in 2014 to get it to run.  After those two I finally got to play it. It looked very good. It feels very nice to play - character reponses are fluid and there isn't a bunch of slowdown I experienced from the last game. FOV's stuck at something below 90, so take what you will from that.   It implements a lot of the improvements made by the sequel to this game (Metro: Last Light) and implements them into this game, which means stealth works and I was able to run it at nearly max settings! A new feature allows you to play it as a survival horror kind of shooter (the proper Metro 2033 experience) or as a straight-up on rails shooter (the equivalent of having chocolate-flavored vodka instead of drinking it straight up LIKE A REAL METRO DWELLER DOES), so there's that.  If you're playing this for the first time, don't skimp and get the original Metro 2033. The Redux version is a far more refined experience. You could argue that going for the remake loses some of the original shoddiness, and in that case, do whatever you like. But if you're dipping your toe into this strange flavor of Eastern Europe first person shooters for the first time, get the Redux.",

            "review_text": "Metro 2033 Redux takes everything great about the original game and turns it up to 11. It's one of my favorite FPS stories ever. If you've played the original and loved it, you owe it to yourself to play the Redux version. If you haven't played the original, what the hell is wrong with you? Go play it...now...I'll wait on you..........see, wasn't that worth it?   If you love FPS games with a story, this game is for you. It has a nice mix between action/horror/stealth and you can play many levels in various ways to better fit your play style. Wanna run and gun? You can. Wanna sneak your way through? You can do that in some levels too. Wanna streak through naked? Well, no, you can't do that, but seriously, the ability to play through several levels however you want is a welcome change, even if you can't stealth your way through the entire game (that or my stealthiness sucks).   Pros     Great graphics (improved on the already beautiful original).    Great gameplay (again improved).    Great story.    The ability to upgrade weapons.   Some voices seem to have been redone...most are improvements, some...not so much.   The ability to knock out guards.   The dedicated melee button instead of having to select your knife, which was tedious in the middle of a fight.   Did I mention they made an already gorgeous game even more so?   A shining example of how you do a remake.    Cons    A few of the voices I've noticed have been redone...specifically, the voices of children seem...umm, not so childlike compared to the original.   A few bugs I ran into that required several reloads. All were crashes to desktop and all were eventually playable without anything more than restarting several times.   Manning the turrets with a controller during the on-rails section is a bit convoluted. Instead of using one stick to aim, you must use one stick to aim left/right, the other stick aims up/down. It felt nowhere near intuitive to me and should've been mapped to one stick.   Having to sit through the opening legal screens each time you start a game.    Seriously, WTF?    How come once I break stealth, I can't hide again very easy? Seems that once I'm spotted, I have a large neon 'shoot me' sign flashing over my head.   Not to beat a dead horse, but seriously, what kind of hormone treatment do the kids get? They sound like they're on some HGH or such.   Where the hell does Artyom put that guidance system? I mean, obviously his pockets are full since you have limited ammo you can carry...so I'm scared to know the answer to how this thing is carried about...  ",

This game is very linear (which isnt necessarily a bad thing as i like many linear games) but this game makes you feel like you have no choice on where to go (your not meant to in linear games but other games design it so you feel like you do which makes it very immersive).  Pros -Guns are very fun to use and feel realistic. -Guns have modifications which make the game more interesting  Cons -While the guns are fun to use alot of enemies are boring to kill (To put into perspective one enemy is a sort of dog hound, You get zero satisfaction from killing it.)

Metro is a great game with lots of action (in every sense of the word), and a decent story. Regardless of which path you choose, you have to save a monkey who ultimately saves the human race.

The voice actors often have clearly audible American accents under their half-hearted imitation of Russian. The sounds are wrong, the speech patterns are often wrong, and many of these 'Russians' end up sounding Spanish, or even Texan, as a result.  I'm not sure if I'm supposed to be playing a game or watching a movie. For the amount of walking around and listening to unimportant NPCs, having the story narrated to me, or just plain losing control of my character, there doesn't seem to be much actual game-play. I've had less intrusion from JRPG cut-scenes. If the developers had wanted to make a movie, they should have made a movie. I'm here to play a game.  Why does everyone treat you like you're the Second Coming or something? Like, you struggle to survive through the first little bit and it's still the tutorial so you're shooting walls and your allies and just generally still learning the gameplay and then everyone's all like, 'Oh that Artyom! He's a deadeye shot!' and I'm like, really? And then you do one stage further and barely survive an attack and don't really manage to help or to save/protect anyone, and they drink to you three times in a row back at the bar! Honestly I'd prefer some idiot asking whether someone had stolen my sweet roll. Your character is worshipped so much and the game does so much ego stroking that it's just embarrassing.  Also the posters telling me to go to  metro.com  or whatever are totally immersion breaking and there are a few poorly integrated product placements and advertisements like that. Like, I'm already playing your game, why do you have to put all this stuff that doesn't match the rest of the scenery in and remind me that this is a video game?  Also the tutorial is awful. Doesn't teach you how to melee attack, just generally leaves a lot of gaps.  ALSO, this is supposed to be survival horror? I'm just not really scared. I don't know if I'm not invested in these characters or if the bad accents and immersion-breaking ads are taking me 'out of the world' or what, but I'm pretty easily scared by games and this one is not doing it for me.  Overall I'd say the Bioshock series does all of this stuff much better. I'm unsatisfied enough that I won't continue playing this game. Not worth the money.",

That function is not in the game's engine, so let's say you like Far Cry 2 and onwards at least, then Metro 2033 is nothing like it. They simply have no idea how to make this first person shooter feel real. You cant do two things at the same time basically. Its an either or throughout the game.  -----STEALTH: When you stealth, if you get caught (levels are btw usually not put in place for it to be possible to pull off cool stealth things), so uh if you get caught, everyone will immediately know where you are. If one person saw you there, the others who are somewhere completely different, will know instantly. The mechanics of all AI in this game is quite dumb.  -----RAILS: You are on rails in different carts in this game quite a lot. Do you remember sitting in the back of a lorry in Call of Duty (the first game, the good game that had actual content) and you used bazookas to kill trucks following you? How great that was. In THIS game, you see a bunch of dumb monsters jump around your cart underground and scream etc. Everything is predetermined at that point, and you're not able to shoot any of these, because to save money and programming skills, the engine in this game is so bad, that it can't produce anything but different stages and modes. Let me explain:  If a monster is running around your cart, it is in 'Fixed animation mode' where it wont actually be a moving thing, it will just be an animated thing which cant interact with the world, and the world cant interact with it. It just looks the same as the things about to interact with you. What you'd think really, is when you see a monster running around like this is 'OMG SHOOT IT!' but actually you cant, because it's not actually there yet. It will then make itself look like its jumping onto your cart, and then change its mode to 'Stuck to your cart and you can interact with it-mode', where it will scream at you and attack you, which means you can actually shoot this thing which now has landed at a predetermined moment on your cart. It was not of its will, it was just programmed to do exactly as it was told, and that goes for every AI throughout the game. I hope my explanation was.. OK.   -----GASMASKS (and finding your way): Oh lord -.- The most advanced and lively aspect of this game, is the realism the gas mask brings you.  First of all: You need one now and then to breathe. It then gets a bunch of blood on it which you have to clean away, and while you're running around, your guy will start breathing heavier and heavier because the filter needs to be swapped quite often. This means you have to stock up on filters when you can, which means you have another thing to spend money on which in my money is just like.. 'we didn't have any better ideas dude, so we put this in'.  This also means you'll hear a heavy, annoying breathing noise. It will also cover with droplets, making your screen covered with this blood now and then and these droplets. Ugh...  Now to finding your way. You know when you see that area over there where there's basically nothing, so it's probably barred off with something so you're supposed to go somewhere else? That's quite often where you're supposed to go, and you'll be stuck running around wasting precious gas mask time which you previously stocked up on, to look for where to go. Then you may ask yourself: 'Where should I move?' and the answer to that is: 'On'. That is all. 'Move on! And then when you have reached a boring cutscene of fake russian accents, stop, stock up, and move on some more in this extremely dull and boring world.'  There is no objective to follow, you can't ask the journal for help or anything. It just happens that whatever road is open to you, is EXACTLY where you're supposed to go, even though the story has a predetermined set point of where you're going. If you're lazy, you'll be googling quite a lot to find your way before your gas mask filters are all gone. This puts a stopper to the whole gameplay experience.  -----THE GAMEPLAY EXPERIENCE:  is quite sucky anyway. If you've ever seen videos of this game thinking 'This game looks like another dull FPS with no real content but to move from A to B to C and kill people as you go' then you were completely spot on correct. I bought this game because everyone bragged their asses off at it, but I should seriously have trusted my instincts, and so should you!  -----THE STORY It sucks so far. You meet people now and then, and then they die so that you can meet a new person somewhere else. Mostly you meet them when they come in at the last second to save you. So you are a survivor, saved by those you meet, but everyone you meet who had a really good first impression, will die.  -----MISC They say it's a game based on a book, and the book I bet is great. The game is there to milk the book for money as cheaply as it possibly can. I'll add here that the graphics and other mechanics are also pretty bad. Voice acting is also bad.   You can save a little boy. I really wish I hadnt. He was just annoying. While carrying him, the mechanics of the movement and aiming has as slight delay because you are.. carrying a boy. Later, you will give this boy to his mother. A music will play, which means you now have 2 soundtracks playing at once. At this point, without the kid, the kid is still on your back on your shadow, and youre running with your hands as if holding a gun, without holding a gun.  Small mutant dogs or whatever come at you from wherever they want, holes here and there, which then attacks you once and runs away. While running around finding your way, this becomes extremely annoying.  The game is outdated in most aspects. For both its initial release, and the 2014 Redux update.  Weapons have mods, but these are few and boring.  You're usually doing the same thing over and over again in this game, not a lot of new stuff.  The weapons are very few btw, and only 2 weapons are actually stealthy. A melee knife which you stab at people or cut their throats which both look very weird, and throwing knives, which are clunky to throw, or even find. Google how to do it, and you'll have both Xbox players and PC players ask for this. The thing is to clunkily hold tab, drag with mouse to specific thrown item (no, you cant quickly swap, are you mad?) and then hit the throw key. Which reminds me: Throwing a grenade from darkness into unsuspecting enemies means they will see you the moment you throw it, scream 'there he is' in fake russian, and everyone in the area will shoot at you immediately like that.      -----CONCLUSION---------&gt; VERY disappointing game which I dont understand why people have been bragging about.",

Ingredients: 1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 2. 1/2 cup white sugar 3. 1/2 cup brown sugar 4. 1/4 cup water 5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon 6. 1 pinch salt 7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced 8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie   Directions: 1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing. ",

This makes aiming with a mouse extremely annoying and takes all the fun out of playing the game.  This is not just a problem for me. The Steam forums and other Metro forums are filled with threads complaining about this issue. From what I've seen, the developer Deep Silver has not even acknowledged the problem.

My entire playthrough was filled to the brim with an atmospheric aura of dread, tense struggles for survival, and literally choking as my mind went into a frenzy trying to decide my best course of action to locate one last dreg of O2 to subsist on.  For the first time in what seems an eon, I actually forgot I was playing a game, and instead became one with the world and resided within the soul and mind of this character. When I wiped my visor, it was a desperate measure to keep what little sense of advantage I felt I had over my situation. With a smoggy and vapor-filled vision, I could easily be taken out by the very next enemy. Without a wary watch on the ammo count for each of my weapons, I could possibly run out of the type necessary for my very next encounter. Even the on-rails segments never felt fully guaranteed, as in most shooters.  Yes, this title has a few negatives. Some examples being poor checkpoint placements in certain areas, some silly voiceovers for the English-inclined (especially the obnoxious sounding children), and crucial immersion-building side conversations which are overtaken by one another, leaving you helpless to just barely make out a single one.  But such failings were quickly remedied on every occasion by my very next forays into the somber warzone that is Metro 2033. I even appreciate my actual life a little more because of my time spent in this world. Get this game, play it on at least hardcore-survival mode, and enjoy an experience you won't soon forget. ",

I'm sure if looked into one could find another handful of bugs.   As of writing this review I'm struggling to finish the game as the nightvision bug keeps coming up and it makes me want to vomit.  Edit (Encountered 30 minutes after the original review): Other bugs and annoyances: The ability to skip ahead of the game and launch 'early' gauntlet waves causing you to go through two or three waves as the NPCs catch up to the trigger point. Nasty on the ammo. Multiple 'active cutscenes' where you would reasonably assume you're in combat, but your bullets are ineffective regardless of the hit markers --another drain on ammo. As I read other reviews I see this does not get better from where I am at in the story. I may give up on this game.   Think I can safely say that I hate this game. Not even a mild dislike. I've grown to hate the damnable thing.  Edit: I really did try to finish this game, but after another 10 minutes of nightvision cutscenes (one finally long enough to fully drain my battery and toggle the NV off), and four hardcrashes I'm done.

Only in chapter 5 I learned how the damn crossbow reload system worked; - Grenades are useless. They take forever to explode, and creatures are too fast.

The same glitches as before, when you turn on AA it drops your frames drastically, then you can set AA to X0,5 which actually highers your frame but makes the egdes so much more pixeld, as if you turn of minus AA. NPCs and interactive objects are still partially unresponsive... I could go on. Basicly the only thing that was slightly increased is the graphics and they switched to the newer engine, that runs the 2nd part.   About the game itself: The NPCs are held minimal, you can only interact with very few, causing them to say a boring oneliner. Inside save zones all you hear is npcs saying the same lines over and over and over and over again. The levels are of complete linear design, basicly you're just runninng through the story and nothing more. In total I would give that game a 4/10.

As for gameplay, the addition of the metro Last light stealth system means that stealth is actually possible in this version of the game and combat feels even more satisfying, allowing players to duck back into the shadows and reposition. The levels have also been given additional paths and hidden secrets which enourage exploration (you can actually find some very important gear quite early if you explore each level and listen to people's dialogue) Overall, I would say that this is a worthy addition to anyone who enjoyed the original Metro 2033 or was unable to play it but would like to.",

Metro tells the story of Artyom travelling through the Russian metro system battling with different factions (Nazis, communists) and mutant creatures as well as a new threat called the Dark Ones.  If you haven’t played originally on release, the Redux version absolutely worth buying, and even for veterans it still worth the prize. It enhances the original with better game engine, performance and a few assets like the wrist watch and HUD elements from Last Light. It also eliminates armor and puts Ranger mode into the game for 100% immersion.  The Graphics is amazing and really detailed so with every step you take there are little things you will stop just to look around. Facial and character animations works great, giving the base tone for the game. The Sound design is immersive and gives you the creeps in some places, but that’s why it’s so good.  For me the combination of Story and The World design which makes this game one of my favorites where you truly care for these desperate people of the Metro. Probably the only concern I could say is the total lack of multiplayer, which could have been additional fun.  I can truly recommend for this game for new and old players alike.

I will say that if you enjoy carefully picking through levels and finding loot or really taking a close look at the detail in the world, listening to NPC dialogue, reading signs, studying the environment, etc. It is more of an adventure game. The plot was decent and kept me going. You fight both Survivalist Bandits and Irradiated Creatures, and somehow they don't really go well together. The monster parts were dull and overly difficult. The Bandit combat was actually quite excellent, I with there was more of that. So, as an adventure game with a linear plot, great job.

Metro is level design and a testament when developers get their ♥♥♥♥ right, great game is made. It's achievement hunting at its finest. It's has darkness and it also has... spiders.  You play as Artyom, a young man just turned 20 and was tasked a critical mission by an unknown ranger from a far away land. You rebel against your father and look what it does to you. That's right, ♥♥♥♥ing Librarian.  I personally have not beaten the game but am very close to. I might change my opinion on this game as I progress but so far it's captivating. Have not played the OG Metro 2033 but I can say that the Redux version brings a very memorable gameplay. It looks pretty too. I mean you can't go wrong with a remastered version, can you?  Have not experienced any lags or bugs, fps drops are scarce and it plays smoothly. Looking for a post-apocalyptic game with a different twist, a bit linear and has a good ♥♥♥ story then this is for you.  Get this! (on or off sale)",

The enemies are very interesting, and at times can be very scary. Especially the sounds they make and how the sound travels through the tunnels creates a very intimidating atmosphere. It doesn't have many jumpscares, so if you're looking for that, I wouldn't buy this game.  All in all this is a great looking and performing game. It has very interesting weapons and enemies. The story is very well written in my opinion, so if you're looking for an atmospheric post-apocalyptic shooter, I definitely recommend this game.

            "review_text": "So people who don't know what the Metro series is all about and are want to know. Let me just quickly summarise it for you. Both Metro 2033 and Metro last light are built on the books by Dmitri Gloukhovski, were Metro last light doesn't follow it all the way through like Metro 2033 does.  The game is set in a post-apocalypse world where the third world war has taken place. The surface is now uninhabitable by humans, and is now infested with strange creatures called the black ones (No racism). The games genre is quite mixed, it's a story driven 'horror' fps with some survival elements. The 'horror' in the franchise is based on the fact that you are screwed if you  1. Don't have any ammo  2. You let an enemy sneak up on you.   So on to the actual game than?  Story: 7/10 The story is not the best element in the game, it's quite boring most of the time, it's like this. Go to point A than point B and so on, there is some explorations involved but that's quite limited. The settings where the game is represented in are really cool, I will never forget my feelings of going out to the dead city for the first time.   Gameplay: 8/10 The gameplay is good, it feels nice most of the time. I find it quite hard to move around at sometimes, like when you are attacked by a group of monsters, they will rush you most of the time even do you have a person with you (Which is not often). It feels really good to shot a enemy and actually killing them.  Graphic: 10/10 Simply said this game is beautiful, the amount of detail in this game is amazing. The surface is a really cool place to visit with all the mist that they have added to the game. Guns look really cool and corpses as well. The blood effect can be quite of sometimes, like F.E.A.R off.   Score:  8/10 Play if if you want a good time in a post-apocalyptic world, where you are the prey.",

The plot is the thing i really like of this game, because it's really strong, sometimes when you walk outside in the city of moscow you can see visions of the people who lived in, plus the graphic image of the destroyed city and the dangers of it.  After i played this game a years ago with torrent download i bought it recently (thanks steam sales) because it's really worth too support the people who made it. Resuming the game with it's pro and cons i can say.. Pro's - good gameplay  - great history, its very similar to the book (but the book is better) - Nice graphics and ambientation. - Nice stealth fighting modes. - Diverse languages you can hear (putting the game in russian feels more reallistic even if i don't understand anything) - Finally something happens not in a place in USA or some 3rd world country. Con's - Some sounds of the main character i really don't like. like when you stab or fall from some places, it sounds like an a old quake or doom game lol). - Maybe the fighting with the creatures it's a little simple and boring, but its a minor thing  Finally its a game i recommend if you are bored of COD or BF franchises, its really worth playing it, even if it doesn't got a multiplayer gameplay (which i prefer not).",

The graphics are definitely top notch and gorgeous for something supposedly so dark and derelict, and I could not ask for more from a post-apocalyptic world graphic-wise.   The mutants are unique and provide a very nice challenge and a different taste from what I'm used to.   As said, the only issue with the game that I have is the fact that unless you're looking at the prson talking, you have to rely on subtitles, It's not much of an actual issue, just a annoyance that I myself have.",

The problems are the survival and linear level approach. Combined this means youll be running out of filters, ammo and kit forcing you to restart the level or even go back to the previous one (or futher... ) to reset your mistakes.  Monsters come in droves and will eat ammo and health. You can stealth it - but this is an 'FPS'.... And theres ranger mode - probably the best way to play it. But outside of trading i had no idea how much ammo i had left. And how much health do I have? In real life i can feel the pain or see the damage. In a game i can only rely on a red flashing screen. Realism or silly...????  Its not all bad, i enjoyed the combat against humanoids and the story is imo ideal for a FPS. Its Doom style, your an aimless hero blundering on cluelessly.  But i played it through refering to a game guide. even then there are some annoying checkpoint saves that get tedious if triggered at the wrong point. But atleast i wasnt running out of filters and new what to buy from where.   Ultimatly id give the game 6/10. Its worth playing with a guide at the deal prices, but its to frustrating otherwise. Its like stalker with less bugs and less freedom. More polished but not half the game.

I highly recommand everyone to play this on at least survival ranger difficulty for the best experience.  I normally don't like horror games. Most of them don't scare me, but if they really scare me, I would normally be so disturbed that I can't continue to play. Metro is a rare game that I feel scared at some part but can't stop playing.  I never read the novel. To me the story and character motivation is sometimes not very clear or well developed, but still understandable. The atmosphere in this game is truely amazing. The lighting, the sound, the levels, the realistic designs, the creatures.. Just amazing. There are very few game could make me panic as if my real life is under threat, this game is one of them.  If you are on ranger mod, don't expect a COD style FPS, most of the time stealth is the best option. And sometimes, not kill the enemy is actually better. Just few complains: Firstly, if you play on labtop, sometimes you may experience constant FPS drops, especially on your first run. Secondly, the control menu in the game doesn't show how to use the charger and your lighter. But as long as you have internet, it's fine. Thirdly, the monsters are much stronger than humen enemy. Which makes a lot of sense. But most of time all the benefit for kill monster is wasting your bullets. Some of them, like the libarian and the devil are extremely hard to kill and highly dangerous. Overall, I will give this game a 8/10. If you like post-apocalypse genre, you must play this. I regret I didn't buy this earlier.",

You spend nearly the same amount of time fighting humans as you do irradiated beasts.

            "review_text": "One of my favourite games ever!  This game is the adaptation of the Metro 2033 book (Dmitri Glukhovsky), which I also strongly recommend. To make it short, you are Artyom, a young Moscovite man, who has lived in the metro system of Moscow for the past 20 years, since a nuclear war wiped out all life on the surface (or has it?). Some weird stuff is happening in the tunnels near your home station, and you have to report about it to the 'police' force of the subway, forcing your way through nazis, comunists, opportunists, bandits, mutant creatures and other scary stuff. (If it's still not clear for you : this is an allegory of post-comunist Russia).  The graphics are beautiful, the sound is gorgeous, the story is convincing and enthralling, the gameplay on point. I love the shooting mechanics, the customization of your weapons, the choice of weapons, the variety of enemies.  Regarding the game itself, there are a few jumpscares here and there, but not too much, it's mostly a sort of psychological horror (apart from sheer blood and violence when fighting) that creeps on you. There are several game modes, which lead you to various playstyles. You can play it in the easy difficulties, where there's ammo everywhere, and you just plow your way through everything (or try to sneak, fail, and then have to shoot everyone). Or you can play in harder difficulties, where you are forced to stealth your way simply because there's no bullets to shoot anymore.   The only downsides of this game are the limited possibility of replaying (since it is fairly linear) and the impossibility to play in highest difficulty on the first time. Explanation : in highest difficulty mode, you have no UI, and no clues of what key to press to interact with objects, or how to select your different weapons. Meaning that you'll be stuck. So you have to play it once with the hints, telling you how to choose knife/mines/grenades, and then play it in harder, once you understand how it works.  Overall, a great game with a good scenario!",

This and the Dead Island series turned me on to Deep Silver, they really have made some great games.   I would recommend this game to anyone and everyone, I would say that you will almost certainly know if you like or dislike the game within two hours of playing so if you haven't gone through this series before you're missing out on a really cool experience and if you don't enjoy it, just grab a refund.

The scarcity of ammo was another thing. You couldn't just spray away or else you'd be left with nothing but a knife, or you could decide to essentially start shooting money, which was the only way to purchase necessary equipment.  Now we have the Redux version. Which has less to no bugs (I haven't encountered any yet), the optimisation has improved drastically and stealth is now not only viable, but often the best way. The game levels are also a lot more interactive. It's great to shut off all the lights, stick on my NVGs and get away with no one aware of my presence. Apart from the lack of an FOV slider (seriously? I thought this was guaranteed) the game is now more or less flawless in my eyes. I've been lucky enough, as I've said, not to run into any bugs.

I haven't yet played Spartan, but I will say that Survivalist is a great way to start the game for your first time. The game last about only 6-8 hours depending on your difficulty and skill but it is, at least for me, very replayable with different styles to play like silent and close range, silent and long range, loud and close range, or loud and far range. All ways have proven to be fun and awesome. My only kind of complaint about this is sometimes the lips of NPC's are really wierd and the mind trips are also very confusing and its hard to figure out what you're supposed to do.

It seemed unbalanced in difficulty while playing on normal with FPS experience opted.  Graphically, it is decent, but it is finicky. I had to disable NVIDIA's AP option to get the game to run for more than a few moments. I couldn't max it out with my system, which must mean it is poorly optimized.  i7-5930k, EVGA GeForce GTX 980 Ti x2 in SLI, 32GB DDR4 Crucial Sport, ASUS ROG Rampage Extreme 2011-v3, and EVGA SuperNova 1600W G2. With nearly $3,000 in hardware, running this maxed in 4K should have been zero issue, but I had to play through in 2K just to get playable framrates.  But that is all coding and insignificant in regards to the quality of this game.  I highly recommend you play through this whether you are a fan of this genre or not.

The Game designs are great every level no matter how hard there is a chance to win even if u hav 1. Zero ammo for your guns when you arrive at a level.the levels always hav ammo and different gun on the level so u cant say that it didnt give u any chances.   2. Gasmask at almost zero i discovered a trick at a level where there were almost no gas filter and i kept losing at that level becuz i dont hav enough time to survive the radiation an event so wht i did was take off my mask n put it back on between a few seconds .Which was not really realistic but hey i do wht to survive.  3. Stealth is hard but not impossible without silenced guns jus need good timing and knife throwing accuracy(i had no cursor on my difficulty so i failed a lot of times)  4. there are like meds eveywhere.The amount of time i used them n the amount of time i used them is about the same so dont waste ur bullets on those meds.  this game really needed me to focus on conserving ammo so all and all a good game",

I'm glad I finally caved and picked it up during the black friday sale of 2015.  The story was not the strongest I've seen but the game made up with it through gameplay, immersion, and atmosphere. It didn't freak me out as much as Amnesia: TDD did but certain levels had me on edge and others outright creeped me out which is to me, a very good thing.  The game allows you to play stealthy or guns blazing and even offers two actual gameplay settings (Survivor and Spartan). I found that a stealth run through with the survivor setting gave the best experience and I was glad that I could choose between knocking out an opponent from stealth or killing them. There were a few chapters which took me a hell of a long time to finish stealthily but was incredibly rewarding when I did.  Bottom line, I had fun. Now, time to play Last Light.",

            "review_text": "Woa... don't know where to start.  Given that Steam doesn't allow rating games, or that there's no 'it's okay' option pressed in between the 'yes' and 'no' option, I'm forced to choose NO. This is not a bad game and wow, it does have it moments. But there's so much here that I felt was missing. I'll address all the good/bad points:  Firstly, the story isn't very rich. It's just the usual go to this station, then go there, and then oh wait a minute just take a detour and do this. Video games are like that, yes, but there's a bit of a story that drives the plot too, that makes you feel important and useful about what you are doing. At one point, I did not even care to collect all the Artyom notes. So if you just want to enjoy a very pretty looking game and with nothing but combat, go ahead.  Secondly, like I said, it's a damn pretty game. Amazing detail to everything. Fog, lighting, water droplets. Amazing at atmosphere. Even the sound work was excellent, the whole of Moscow and it's metro felt alive and had to look behind me so many times because of the monster sounds. Although, the music didn't seem to suit the atmosphere (you can mute it if you want) and the voice acting is downright terrible. Russian's trying to speak English and at the same time trying to make their Russian accents heavier? What a joke! Why not just let them speak in Russian and provide us with English subtitles? That'll have added so wonderfully to the atmosphere! Oh well...  Moving on... Thirdly, the AI is brilliant in combat. They hide, take cover, and try to circle us. Even on Normal difficulty, I had problems plenty of time but it was fun. The stealth is one of the best I've ever seen. There are literally places where can go on without being seen and there are multiple hidden ways. You can friggin' switch of light sources to stay hidden. I loved this and it was fun evading the enemies. You get both human and mutant enemies (the mutant enemies always bring an element of surprise as you progress through). But personally, I loved combatting the humans more.  There's another ugly spot here: the AI is stupid when they are not looking. Like at this one point I killed a guy and suddenly his friend came out of nowhere. I got chance to hide. But when he saw his dead friend, he's reaction was like 'Argh, musta been a rat, never mind'. Dude, your friend's dead! And there was this point where I hid behind a crate and an enemy surprised me. But he didn't even seem to see me! What a joke. And this happened so many times.  Lastly, the combat system is good. You get a variety of weapons and the game really forces the player to be different in gameplay (and makes him/her scavange for supplies a lot) as we get newer enemies. But one frustrating, I mean really really really frustrating thing is that it never gives any tutorials on using most of the weapons. Half of the game I had to figure out how to throw the grenades or use the melee weapon! Or even how to recharge your flashlight or your weapon (some weapons need recharching). Due to the fact that my walking speed is a little low, it dragged down the game even more. Just because of this, I felt cramped and uncomfortable in an already claustrophobic game. This is a huge drawback but I guess a hack can improve it.  Metro 2033 (Redux) has a lot of potential and has it's moments (I'm willing to re-play many of it's levels) but it's a messy game with a poor, very uninteresting story that goes for forced profoundity but just comes out laughable (there's not much of story here either). Here's hoping Last Light is much better and much richer. And that there's more stealth in it!",

When I began the game back in 2010, I assumed it would follow the stereotype of a heavily scripted, first-person shooter where you could always shoot your way out of trouble if all else failed. Soon after beginning the game, I reached a section I simply could. not. beat. I tried for what seemed like days, but ended up throwing in the towel in favor of some other flavor of FPS. Coming back six years later, I now realize that Metro 2033 is a game which, although scripted, forces the player to use his/her head just as much as his/her gun. There are chapters, such as the one I could not beat when I first began the game, which simply cannot be beaten with brute force. Sometimes you have to think your way out of situations, sometimes you have to sneak, and some times you have to run flat out until you think you will collapse. Having now completed the game, I appreciate that the beauty of Metro 2033 is in the diversity of play styles it presents to the player, which keeps the gameplay fresh and ensures you'll have to get creative when you realize you only have 4 rounds left...and you're not alone in the dark.",

Survival in the missions are challenging in Metro 2033 unlike Last Light. I waited awhile to get this because they upgraded the graphics which does take in some part of how much I like a game and it is pretty compariable to the Last Light non redux. Metro 2033 has alot more to explore than the linear line design of last light. Overall if you come from Last Light you do have to force yourself into 2033 until the pace of missions gets interesting. My point where I enjoyed the game was when the Reds and the Nazis were having a battle in the tunnes and you were able to find Night Vision goggles, so cool and you cant find Night Vision Goggles in Last Light for sure.",

Hence, you'll have to keep playing if you're a perfectionist and feel the need to unlock all achievements.  Some people might've reviewed the game negatively about the controls and movement but it felt just fine to me. Game didn't crash but I did encounter an odd issue. The game triggered the lights on my Alienware, causing them to flash on and off. It wasn't a big deal, happened only once.  To fix it I turned the lights off on the laptop. Started the game the next day and it was fine, lights were all normal. Looked it up on Google and some players were writing about how certain games can cause that issue; Battlefield, Metro, some others.  If you're interested in Metro, I would suggest buying the package deal which has Metro 2033 Redux and Metro Last Light Redux. It's a lot cheaper and you're basically purchasing Metro #1 (2033) and #2 (Last Light) at a discount.  Cheers. o/",

I liked most of the gameplay changes. However it is still mostly the same linear level, thus replayability is not very good.

When you start a new game it gives you the option of playing it as a survival horror (Ranger Mode) or as a more or less run and gun FPS (Spartan Mode). I picked Spartan mode so I'll focus on that until I get a chance to play Ranger mode. Spartan mode has more plentiful ammo and pickups (medkits, gas mask filters) so you don't have to do much resource management but you still need to be careful with your ammo, I ran out completely a couple of times. And I never got below 3 medkits. The combat has good mechanics, you can't hide behind cover for long as it will deteriorate under enemy fire. You have to develop different strategies against mutants and humans in what I thought was a good balance between the two. The real high point in the game is the story, which in my opinion, is on par with the Bioshock games. My only gripe is the length. It's kind of short but it is definitely re-playable, even more so if you consider the two different modes which essentially make it two games in one. Do yourself a favor and get it already, you won't be disappointed.  Bottom Line: Graphics: 9/10 Story: 10/10 Combat: 10/10 Length: 6/10  10/10",

I was so happy when I finally made the switch to PC gaming and they went over this game and gave it a face lift not that I wouldn't have bought it even if they didn't. I still re-install and play through it once in awhile, just like Half-Life, I find myself coming back for this same feeling I got the first time I played it. Awesome game IF you have not played it, buy it and play through it you will love it. Ranger Mode All The WAY!!",

The storyline is full with hard unconscious decisions that will eventually change the game´s ending. Survival is one of the thoughest i have seen but also highly entretaining. First person shooting dinamics are solid and well structured and weapons constumizable. The only aspect they should improve is the shadowing. They dont work to good on mac. Highly recommended if you like a post-apocaliptic scenario full of mistery and terror.",

Years later I finally got to play and finish the redux versions and I have to say this is a severely underrated game. A perfect blend of impressive atmosphere, tight gun combat and a story that suck you into the world and characters, especially the main character Artyom.  There are a few gripes though minor like the NPCs share the same voices and the melee attack is slow and unreliable.  Other than that, Metro 2033 Redux is one of the best post-apocalyptic shooters out there that could rival that of Half-Life 2.",

I do not really wanna spoil, so that's enough of what im gonna say about the story. When you first start the game up you get to choose between only two difficulties, survival or spartan. Each of these playstyles are unique. Survival leans heavily on, well.. survival. Which means that there is not that much ammo and filters are scarce, this is the ultimate Metro 2033 experience. Spartan is the ''easy'' mode and more action oriented. Which means that ammo and filters and gadgets are plentiful. All i can say is that you should buy this game immediately!. One of the most underrated games of all time.  Also this game is a little bit craving, so you might need a good GPU.  +Good story +Awesome gameplay +Beatiful level designs +Good character development  -bugs  ",
