            "review_text": "Fun! The gun's angle are way too high though. I acutally got this to help train for other FPS (onward for example).  And It will of course work on reflex and target finding. But the angle means that musle memory wont be right.  This asside, Its a fun game! I am only at the second statge of challenges (spent all my time on the first trying to get the highest ranking possible) but I can already see this being addictive!   Great excercise too!",

            "review_text": "Ok - so I'm one of those people that wasn't sure if I would like this game. Would it be just another pretty dull shooter? Would it have replayability? Would it be difficult yet realistic?  The answer to all of the above? YES, YES, YES!  This is a pretty damn fine shooter and makes it feel really like you are a recruit on basic training.   I love the 'special guns' and the varying levels of success. I got 'Lethal status on only two of my first run throughs and I'm heading back to beat me scores on the others.   I've got a 2.2 x 2.2m play space and honestly - I could do with a little more for some of the areas but mostly this is a faultless game thats a lot of fun.   Solid buy especially at this price.",

            "review_text": "Excellent fun and a good learning curve. I'm no good with the knife throwing yet but the CQB training is bang on. It's immensely satisfying seeing the points rack up following a double tap to the head of your target. Even better when you do it while dual wielding.  I've not finished all the rounds yet but plenty of longevity to this title. Always coming back to beat that last score.",

            "review_text": "Great game! Fully finished, very well optimized and pollished and lots of fun to play! You get a very fine training 'simulator' for different weapons like pistol, smg, knife and throwing star and play in various locations so 'training' does not get boring in the 30 exercises. There is even some sort of humor to be found in the bonus round ;)",

            "review_text": "Recommended with a caveat.  This game was fun. I have always enjoyed arcade style shooting games, and this one brings back memories of the 'Police Trainer' arcade game I dumped many a quarter into as a kid (though, it falls quite a bit short of that and I would LOVE it if someone came up with a version of it for VR).  The good: Nice mix of levels, the 360 degrees of shooting is well done, the guns point and shoot rather well compared to the real thing, and enough different 'games' to keep you interested. Also quite polished, with darn good graphics and no bugs whatsoever that I could see.   The bad: The guns and knives are just comically large in your hands...like you're a baby holding a gun. The game is also exceedingly easy to get a lethal rating on just about every category (got lethal in almost every one on the very first go around. Knife throwing also needs a little work, as it just doesn't work all that naturally (and this is coming from someone who is actually proficient in throwing real knives/tomahawks). The levels aren't random, if you replay a level it's exactly the same as the last time you played it with targets appearing/moving in the same place or direction. Finally, you can beat the entire game in less than 60 minutes without even trying.   So long story short, was it fun? Yes. Could it have been longer and maybe have some greater difficulty levels thrown in? Definitely. While I'm not upset at paying $15 for it, as I'm happy to support any VR based design company at the moment that releases a decent game (if only to move forward the industry) I would have hoped for a little bit more content/replay ability.",
