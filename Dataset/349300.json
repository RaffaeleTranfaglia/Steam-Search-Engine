            "review_text": "You want a visual novel that has a ton of lore? Do you like a visual novel that has gameplay elements? Do you like that gameplay to be technical and complicated, yet managable and still enjoyable? You've found the right one.   Take a story that revolves around magical learning and slice-of-life fantasy, then blend it with some time-management and an intriguing dice-rolling mechanic, and you get Littlewitch Romanesque. And is it ever astoundingly good! Nearly every scene between lessons contains lore, and there is enough depth to the worldbuilding within the story to give you a lot for your imagination to explore.   The plot, despite being an eroge (with adult scenes removed on Steam), is actually surprisingly not that perverted. If gratuitous sex is a turn-off in other visual novels, you'll be delighted by how focused the plot is on revealing its world and developing its huge amount of characters. Sure, there's some fan-service (as one will always expect due to the genre), but it's almost always either comedic or sentimental, and rarely feels out of place.   And don't even get me started on the artwork. HOLY CRAP, is this some absolutely stunning art. You can see the love and detail in every single scene.   If you're looking for something story-rich, with fantastic artwork, just the right amount of challenge, and a little less perversion than the status quo, Littlewitch is the VN for you.",

Everytime i load my save i have a smile. Do not ask me why, i have no idea :) Maybe it's the voices ? The good musics ? The lovely graphics ? Or all of this maybe !   I have not finished it yet. I read i need to play it more than one time to get everything unlocked and see all the possible endings.   Editio Regia is the censored version for Steam ",

            "review_text": "This is an extremely addictive raising sim/visual novel. Be warned that by purchasing this on Steam you will not be getting the adult content that is present in this game. You will want to buy this game from jastusa (be sure to switch to the 18+ version of the site) if you want to see that content.  The actual game consists of 150+ weeks (turns) where you may attempt a lesson (which is where the actual dice-rolling gameplay occurs), learn a spell, or go on a quest. Each week also includes a story scene at the beginning and end of the week. Each learned spell and quest completed also yields a story scene, so if you do either of those things (and you usually will), you will have 3 story sequences in a week. Going through these turns and trying to learn spells needed for quests is quite addictive, and even though this game could be considered a visual novel, I sometimes wanted to just skip all the story sections to get back to my objectives. That, for me was the most frustrating aspect of this game; it sometimes feels like it takes forever to accomplish something because of all the exposition I had to get through in order to do so! It seems like this may have been even more the case in the adult version where even more scenes can come up.  What mainly sold me on this game is the art and gameplay. The art is fantastic and maintains excellent quality the whole way through. Even the ordinary character portraits never get old and everything, including backgrounds was done with utmost care. The music is also nice and the ending theme especially is excellent.   It is impossible to do everything in this game in a single playthrough. It took me a little over 10 hours to get through my first playthrough, and on subsequent playthroughs, you can use previously learned spells during the dice rolling lessons, which really increases your potential to learn magic. Because many scenes will have already been read, and can be skipped, new playthroughs have a really good pace and it's fun to try to do events (quests and spells) you chose not to focus on originally. Overall this game is very addictive and excellent value.  One thing to note is that even though explicit content was removed for this version of the game, there are still panty shots and other segments that sexualize the students, who look and act like early junior high students. If you are uncomfortable with that, be aware before you buy.",
