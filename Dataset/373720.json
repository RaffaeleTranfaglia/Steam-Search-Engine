They have mentioned this more than once I believe...   Reminds me a little of Morrowind. Graphics are great! like a fairytale world come to life. Lots of crafting.",

            "review_text": "Ignore my played time please. I have played this game on and off for many years. The Saga of Ryzom....I guess they dropped the Saga part now and just call it Ryzom, is a very unique world. It is a living world where the npc animals interact wiith each other and you. Often while sitting digging up resources a curious animal will wander up and stare at you...and sometimes pee on you. Carnivores eat herbivores and you...herbivores won't attack you. .I'm glad it has come to Steam as it could use an infusion of players that this offers, just in the few minutes I logged in I saw loads of new players in the tutorial area. I'll get to the point...or points. Here goes.  Pros:  - Living world that interacts with itself and the player.  -One of the best Craft systems any MMO has to offer....on par with Star Wars Galaxies (may it rest in peace). Each ingredient has a level, quality, and color that all affect the final product. As well as stats for various things like hardness and flexibility depending on what you are crafting. You don't want a flexible sword....  - 'Craft' your own skills and spells. When you learn a skill you get a set of parts that make up the skill. Want it to do more damage? Ok...but you may need to make it cost more mana. Want to find 3 harvest nodes instead of 1...sure but you will need to balance it out with something. You can use the premade ones...or tailor them to your play style.  - A classless and leveless system. Gain exp in what you are doing. Make your character the way you want. Mix and match skills at will.  - Two different...'religious' type sets that affect the players in interesting ways.  - Four races that are not elves and dwarves....each race has it's own craft style.   - Colorful and interesting world to explore with unique monsters. No rats or bears here.  Cons  - It is an aging game so the graphics are a little out dated, but not that bad.  - Once off the tutorial island....the player density drops....I am hoping that with the Steam boost it will change.  - The UI is a little...wierd. You can move stuff around and such to make it more on par with what you like.  - More like a free trial than free to play, although you can go fairly far without paying into it and have a good time. If you manage to make out your skills on the free account...you probably want to buy it anyway.  - The classless/leveless skill system is great....but it has always felt a little flat to me. There is no reason to pick one race or another, no advantage other thank looks. I feel it would be more...individual...if you were limited to how many skills you could learn. Then there would be some thought into the process. But as it stands everyone can get every skill to either 125 for free or 250 for paid. This is probably more something that bothers me and most won't care.  Overall well worth downloading and trying it out. At least run through the tutorial Island and missions for the various skill sets and see how interesting the world is. It has many unique features that we still don't see in other games. If I had to pick a game that it is most similar too....I would say Star Wars Galaxies for it's crafting system, harvesting and skill system (before they ruined and killed SWG that is).  ",

            "review_text": "I played Ryzom for a while back in the days, and play it again since it's available on Steam reminds me all the things that make me love this game. So I wanted to share my experience.  First of all, the universe is so compelling! The graphics may look a bit oldish, but the artistic direction is just stunning. The different feelings you may experience when traveling these unique landscapes can really move you. It is full of life, from the fauna to the weather and to the seasons.  Next, comes its community. For sure, Ryzom deserves to be called an MMORPG. Here, you will always find someone to help you, to hunt, to travel, to find something you are looking for, and so on. This is not a nowadays so-called MMO where you can just play solo. The force of Ryzom comes from the fact that you need the others players to progress, and that makes it a deep social experience. May you be shy at first, no worries, someone will propose its help soon, and friendships will come. Another important point about the community is the roleplay. A lot of events are organized, by both players and event teams. This engages you so much.  Now, let's talk about the gameplay.  On one hand, I have to admit, the fighting system is a common one. But still, it's pleasant to play with. On the other hand, there are a lot of gameplay features making this game very deep and challenging to master. First of all, the class-less design: this allows you to experiment with whatever you want. Want to be a master fighter? There are tens of weapon types, with their own skill trees. And not to mention, ending only one skill tree is already a challenge in itself. Want to mix some range weapon skills with healing skills? Do it, nothing will stop you combining the talents you have. What keeps it balanced is the equipment you wear. Don't think about doing magic with a heavy armor and a sword in your hands. You will have to put your light cloths on and your magic amplifiers to be efficient.  And about the peaceful activities: again, the harvesting and the crafting systems are very deep. Harvesting won't consist in picking up some resources spawning here and there each 2 hours or so. Instead, there are dedicated skill trees which will allow you to gather rare resources. Also, you will need to learn where to harvest, at which time, and how to harvest efficiently. And every harvester has its very secret receipe that they may share with you. Next comes the craft system, one that I never saw anywhere else. Here, the possibilities are endless. Creating the perfect sword will take you 'ages' of research to find the receipe. The statistics of an object all depends on the statistics of the materials you use and their genuine combinations.  With all these activities, you will see that, everyone needs each other. You need a better axe? You will need a good crafter that knows the ingredients. You will need a harvester that will find that rare wood bark. You will need a team of high level fighter to kill that rare beast that will drop those very sharp claws. You need to harvest some rare materials that only appear once each winter at mid-night, deep under ground in the prime roots? You will need a team to protect you against the fierce kitins or against other player that want it too.  There is so much more to say, but I hope this review will make you want to come by on Atys.  Best regards.",

            "review_text": "  The game itself hasn't changed since I last played, hopefully with a steam release they'll get the players they need to start making the game great again (see what I did?). Ryzom is an AMAZING MMORPG, and I have no issue with the ART STYLE at all. The graphics may not be the most high end, however the game looks amazing because of the art style they chose to go with it. And the non-high end graphics also mean even very old PCs/macs/linux users can almost certainly still play Ryzom on. This actually is very smart as far as gaming goes, because it allows far more players into the game.  Animals interact with you, each other and even the world. On mainland, when it rains, animals go for shelter under the trees. On silan (the starting/tutorial island), you'll first notice Yubos examining you, looking up at you with their cute faces or a herd of animals migrating depending on the day. Animals (some of them) migrate depending on the season, or even the weather. There are herbivores and carnivores, and the carnivores will attack the herbivores and the herbivores will group together to take down the carnivore (or sometimes the carnivore gets away). You never see that kind of VERY advanced AI in even singleplayer RPGs, and Ryzom came out years ago.  And crafting. If you played SWG (star wars galaxies) pre-cu...and loved the crafting there. You'll love this just as much. Different resources give different stats/bonuses to each crafted item, and there is quality to think of to. There are hundreds of thousands or even more, of items of different qualities, stats and bonuses you can craft. Its very much like SWG in that regard.  Harvesting (digging) however is pretty unique in Ryzom. But they didn't have much funding for art of each resource. So it feels pretty meh, when all I do is harvest the same thing and get different items out of it. As far as I have seen, each resource looks exactly the same. A green cluster of blobs. No blue blob, no yellow blob, not even different shapes. They just re-used the art of one harvest 'node' and copy/pasted it to each and every single one. So even if you are harvesting shells or whatever, its just a boring green blob of resources. Feels like they didn't have funding for an artstyle for each type of resource. They probably put in a lore reason (I'm sure there is) for that to hide the fact they couldn't afford it, but...well... still feels like they couldn't afford more art for different resources. Or even different colors of it. Of course, that is just the 'looks'. But it does make it feel meh to me.  When digging, you can interact with said resource. You can 'gently' harvest, where you probably won't get as much out of it, but you won't take damage if it 'explodes' in gas (that happens and you CAN die when digging). And then there is 'harmful' digging of said resource, where you get more quality overall, and the potential to get 2 (or more) of that resource. However, you'll have a bigger chance of a gas cloud, and a higher chance of destroying the resource.  Of course, there is a lot more to harvesting. Different types of resources appear in different seasons (some only appear in winter for example), only in day, or only in night. Its quite involved. And like I said, can even die when harvesting.  There WAS a severe lack of content update...not just for months and months...but for YEARS. I looked on the forums for any significant content update and saw none. Last big one was being able to create your own dungeon or something with Ryzom Ring, but it was abandoned (lack of funds?) and it also didn't give out any rewards or anything at all, so pretty much most lost interest quick. So like the harvesting artwork (whether there is 'lore' reason for the lack of it or not), they haven't had much funding for big updates. With that said, there have been other MMOs (free to play) on Steam that were in the same shape Ryzom is/was in, and then benefited so much that the developers were able to start putting out significant updates to them.  According to wiki's (google search 'define free to play') definition of what free to play.  'Free-to-play (F2P) refers to video games which give players access to a significant portion of their content without paying. There are several kinds of free-to-play games, but the most common is based on the freemium software model.'  As for the 'free to play' negative reviews. That definition is exactly Ryzom's free to play model. There is no wrong advertisement or cheating of words that Ryzom is using. It is literally free to play as defined by wiki and google.  I highly recommend Ryzom, despite a lot of negative reviews, I'd say try it for yourself :) Especially if you like harder MMOs or SWG. Might end up liking it :) Or might not, its very different and very challenging, so won't be for everyone.",
