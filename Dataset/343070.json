            "review_text": "The game is better than I expected it to be. I've run the full round trip once, and I also made another trip from Times Square to Queens. As somebody who rides the 7 from Times Square to 33rd Street everyday, my standards were pretty high. In terms of scenery, they did very good. They placed railroad tracks where appropriate, they put buildings appropriate to the route, and did good with the stations. They even put in specific buildings, such as Aviation High School between 33rd and 40th streets. The train is nowhere near as good as the scenery. The cab is okay. The T/O and C/R indicators are both present, but do not work. The sounds aren't terrible, but the motor sounds are not very good. The physics are pretty off from where they should be, making the train kind of tough to operate at times. Also, the story line is not very good. I didn't want a story, just to simulate train operation. It seems that you'll be fine not participating in the whole story line thing after the first time you play, but I'm not sure. The story line doesn't seem how it should be considering how things work at the MTA. I also want to point out that the game has a few minor bugs, as it is a new release. The last thing I want to say upsets me is that there are no timers present throughout the route, but it is still playable without them. I haven't used the conductor mode yet, so I'll edit this once I have done so.",

            "review_text": "So far so good a few bugs but not to bad a range of 8 missions and different shifts. i like it although the lack of ai traffic red signals during rush hour confuses me. I like being a conductor although it'd be nice just to be that for a route or 2.  Other than that going through tunnels at 40mph and braking as you hit the platform to stop and not the miss the station gives you the ultimate pressure  AGGRO MODE well thats a excellent addition used it a couple of times and think it could be improved aswell as the ai traffic :)  so yes i recomend this if your into simulators (although its still not as good wos3 its a good edition to have especially if you enjoy driving through tunnels and trying not to derail at 35-40mph)",

            "review_text": "The graphics are IN NEED OF UPDATING. The AI people in the depot who share their stories are diverse in missions. Platform people seem to be having trouble entering train. Game playing seems sharp on some curves that even at 19mph it’s too fast. Realistic feeling is good, having to control doors, lights and others from keyboard is a learning curve. Using a gaming laptop without numeric keyboard was a challenge until I just change controls to keys not already in use. No joy stick control available in this game “yet-hint hint”.   I know this route; I grew up in NYC and rode the #7 train many times. It brought back many memories. Cab and other views are nice and since I’m using a laptop I had to test graphics setting to suit my playing experience. There was some “stuttering” but I un-ticked the AA box and it ran much smoother for me. The game is, as others have mentioned frame rate intensive. You can set the conductor’s AI if you don’t feel like switching back and forth from drivers to conductors cab. If doing so you have to line up train at platform for doors to open automatically.   I have had the game freeze, only to restart by power off/on button. Again, just lowered a setting in graphics. No crash report box appeared then. I did have two other crash issues in which a dialog box popped up where you can add your experience before the crash. Very convenient. Weather is another issue; rain and snow. Snow looks like driving through fog with snowflakes.   When things settled down after install, game ran well. I like the interaction. There is room for improvement and I hope they are listening.  ",

Is there any way of requesting a refund seriously? Because this is the worse money I've ever spent on a game. It offers nothing in terms of simulating the experience of driving a train and just offers a dull lifeless experience. The depot element is a complete joke, populated by what appears to be walking dead androids. I could ignore that if the train driving simulation was interesting but it’s not. One example of many is the braking; it’s so flawed the initial brake steps does nothing then increasing the braking the train stops as if it hit a brick wall, totally ridiculous. The London simulator WOS3 really had some atmosphere of the area and the line but seriously this comes nowhere near WOS3, it really is shockingly bad. Steam give me an option to return a game for a refund you should not allow loyal customers to pay for awful games like this without the option for return.",
