            "review_text": "A short, fantastic 2D puzzle game where you play the protaganist P.B Winterbottom who is trying to eat all the pies he can find while chasing after the giant mystical pie of his dreams. With beautifully done artwork and a wonderful story expressed through poetry, this game is definitely worth playing! I thoroughly enjoyed the puzzles which use various time-based mechanics. The puzzles are of easy-medium difficulty with also some time and recording challenges, making it enjoyable for everyone.  Pros: + Fun storyline told through poetry + Beautiful hand-drawn artwork + interesting puzzles that use time-based mechanics + Bonus shorts add extra time and recording challenges + Controller support + Achievements  Cons: - Quite a short game - Would definitely have benefitted from workshop support for user made levels  My Score: 7/10",

This game also utilizes time control like Braid. Here you can create clones of yourself that you can use to help solve puzzles. I wouldn't say essential, but pretty fun and taxing game.",

Using time travel and clones to solve puzzles? My money's on it! But when I got the actual game, I was given the time travel and the clones but the puzzles were just so difficult. Here's some pros and cons:  Pros: - Ok controls - Great idea - Nice looking graphics - Good story  Cons: - Very difficult puzzles (Once you get to the second chapter, you really need very quick reflexes.)  Overall, the game is just too difficult to complete. Hell, I can't even complete the second chapter. While the idea is original, they just had to screw it up. Don't waste your money on this, just buy other puzzle platformers like Battleblock Theater.  Score: 3/10",

            "review_text": "I had this game gathering dust on my Steam library for months, until I finally decided to actually play it start-to-finish for once. It begins slowly; with a gradual introduction to the world, the character and the mechanics, a process reminiscent of a classic tutorial (as it should be), and then after this thrust into the world it leaves you to solve increasingly convoluted puzzles.  The protagonist is a suprisingly lovable one-dimensional character that has but one drive: The urge to eat all the pies he can find. The story, which is not as superficial and 'ad hoc' as it will first seem, is presented in the form of ingenious rhyming silent-film slides, one at the beginning of every level; the art is pure eye-candy and though sometimes the monochromatic nature of the game may feel monotonous, the whole design (especially the oft animated level backgrounds) makes it worth it; and the music can be described in just one word: Superb.  This game is an acquired taste: The more you play it, the more you'll like it. Once you've finished it, if you're thirsty for more, you have quite a few extra bonus levels available which you can attempt to solve as quick as possible or with as few clones as possible to get medals, respectively. This tidbit of information will come in handy, especially if you intend to unlock all the game's achievements.",
