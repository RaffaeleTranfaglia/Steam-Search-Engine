I'd give this game a 10/10 because of the great graphics and the one-of-a-kind characters! With our main hero bumbledore you can expect a great time. The way this game plays so smoothly can make a grown man cry. To conclude, I give bumbledore a 10/10 and I'd say that even though CoD took it's ideas it's still WAY better...",
