    "description": "In This War Of Mine you do not play as an elite soldier, rather a group of civilians trying to survive in a besieged city; struggling with lack of food, medicine and constant danger from snipers and hostile scavengers. The game provides an experience of war seen from an entirely new angle.",

            "review_text": "This game is so heart-wrenchingly surreal that it gets my physical heart to beat at key moments. Here's a little taste:  Day 17. I'm desperately low on food and the survivors are starving. I decide to raid a nearby house in the hopes of stockpiling food. Uponarriving, I find the jouse inhabited by two brothers and their elder parents. I sneak in through the back unnoticed. One of the brothers is about to walk through the door so I ascend to the second. Through the keyhole, I see an old woman come down from the attic and approach the door. I ready my knife and pray that she doesn't come any closer to the door. I don't want to kill her. She stops, idles for a moment in self pity, and then turns back around and enters a different room. I enter and scavenge for supplies when the same brother enters, causing me to hide. He finds the place suspicious and approaches my hiding place. I panic and lunge at him from hiding. He dies noisily, and his brother hears. He runs to apprehend me, but he is unarmed. I dispatch him quickly. The old mother hears and comes down. She sees one of her dead sons and weeps above him. I pause before her as I realize what I've done to them. She cries as she says their names. In one final act of pity, I kill her where she kneels. I loot the rest of the house and escape to my shelter, food in tow. The father, out of earshot to it all and asleep, I've left to awaken to the massacre.  This game touches me so deeply that these actions of mine caused me to ask myself, 'what if this was a choice that I couldn't just hit the resatrt button to?' Then I realized: that question is the game.",

            "review_text": " tl;dr -&gt; This War of Mine has been specifically designed to make you feel like the most hopeless, utter piece of ♥♥♥♥, tugging at your emotions at every opportunity. It will try to take you to the breaking point where you finally begin to consider robbing/killing your helpful neighbor for a few cans of food. This is good, because it makes the game a fantastic war simulator.   Despite my massive backlog, I had decided to pick up This War of Mine because the premise really, really intrigued me - I absolutely love survival games. To emphasize this, I had purchased The Long Dark, then Eternal Winter, then This War of Mine. Although the first two games were a lot of fun, they were still fairly barebones due to early-access status.  I played This War of Mine for 7 hours straight when I first tried it - 3 playthroughs. I love this game so much that I will be adding  immersion-stories to the comments of this review, as well as in my steam group . As an avid reviewer, I play A LOT of games in a short amount of time, and this is easily one of my favorite ones.  If you like grim survival gameplay in a war-torn country, deep immersion potential, testing the limits of your emotions, dark atmospheric themes, and elements from the rogue-like genres, then you will thoroughly enjoy this wonderful, macabre game. I was extremely impressed that an indie game was able to capture the essence of the brutalities and ugliness of war on such an artistic scale.  The aesthetics are fantastic! If you've played the atmospheric platformer Deadlight, you will notice some similarities in the side-scrolling environments. The level of detail in the areas and character models are great, however, I wish there was an option of changing your characters' clothing and appearance (not a big deal). A pencil-shading effect (similar to grain-filter effect seen in games like Mass Effect) adds a very nice touch to the dark and sombre atmosphere - you can adjust this to be soft or more obvious. The music and sounds are great and suit the theme of the game very well. You can also build a radio and leave one of two stations on - one classical and the other more of a general music genre. There is no voice-acting, which I found to flow well with the playstyle.  The game is point-and-click based, so the controls are fairly easy to familiarize yourself with. The learning curve is moderate to difficult, your experience with survival games and how to plan your actions will really affect how successful you may be - keep in mind that the game strongly encourages a pacifist (excluding self-defence) approach. When you start the game, there is no tutorial - you are immediately thrown right into your safehouse. You start off with (usually) 3 survivors randomly chosen from the grand survivor pool - each with a specific skill and weakness (or vice). For example, Arica has a much higher stealth rating and likes to smoke to calm down. You also start in a random season (usually NOT winter). The loot is randomized in each area, however, the layout of each location you can visit remains static.   The game operates on a day/night cycle (you can fast forward to night) - during the day, you will be in your safehouse and do things like build structures, eat, sleep, etc. During the night, you will give your group members different orders: have some sleep, guard, or scavenge (only one may visit an area per night). The areas you can visit are randomized each playthrough, and will sometimes be inaccessible if the civil war leaks over into certain areas. Something I just found out today was that, after    the militia pushes the government's army out of the city, some areas may show signs of war. For example, the church will be devastated and have construction ladders around the outside of it, with armed looters present. This impressed me immensely. (I read up on this, and apparently some areas have more than 1 possible layout, randomized each time you play through)      As you progress through the game, traders and recruit-able survivors will periodically visit your safehouse (limited to one event per day). Various neighbours will also come and ask for your help -    assisting them usually yields immediate or future rewards; and also boosts morale.     Each character needs to eat and sleep - being deprived of either for too long may result in their death or desertion. When you kill, or if a group member is injured/killed, remaining group members will usually experience a blow to morale. Morale falls from 'sad' -&gt; 'depressed' -&gt; 'broken.' When a character is broken (and sometimes depressed), they will be unresponsive to your commands - you will have to have other characters deliver food and medication to them. They will also be unusable as scavengers. To combat this, you can have any of your group members talk to the broken character - you can also try having two characters drink together to alleviate some stress.   Building and crafting is a major element of this game, and you will really have to plan out your build and scavenge routes to maximize your time. Trying to simply rush to the highest craft tier will most likely result in your quick death. On the city map, each visit-able location will have a list of items available to scavenge. Items do not respawn or restock in the different areas, and it is generally a bad idea to rely on randomness if you are in dire need of a specific item, like medicine for example. There are many areas where you can trade/steal from others, however, be advised that (at least early) violent/aggressive playstyles make the game exceedingly difficult if you are unprepared. Killing even one person damages group morale significantly, and it is very easy to find yourself with a group of mostly depressed/broken individuals.  The game adds amazing immersion in the character cards - the different members will record their opinions on what's happening. For example: if the group is starving, but Pavle has eaten, then he will have a comment saying something like: I must find my friends food since I am not hungry. The reactions when someone has committed murder or died are very interesting to see as well.  Overall, This War of Mine paints what I would expect an accurate, emotion-driven picture of what life would be like for unfortunate individuals caught in a war, and the tribulations they have to face to simply survive. If you are interested in war simulation and/or survival elements at all, then I implore you to try this game. You will not come out feeling good after playing it (more of an anti-catharsis), but you will not be disappointed.  ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND!   Cheers, DJSF  @DJSF's Rogue Reviews ",

Will you help the weak out of kindness? Or will you rob everyone blind in the sheer desire to survive? Sure, you can say 'it's just a game', but it's impossible to avoid the feeling that your actions here might well mirror your true inclinations. So what's more important, survival or your humanity? Or can you preserve both? There are moments of both incredible kindness and cruelty to be found within, and they stir something in the human soul that I've rarely seen in games. From running a gauntlet of sniper fire to help a wounded father reunite with his infant son to murdering an elderly couple for their meager goods, it's impossible to play this game without thinking, 'Could that be me? Would I do that? Could I rise that high, sink that low?' And that is the brilliance, the poetry, of this game. ",

            "review_text": "This War of Mine  You start with three (3) people in your hideout in a middle of a war and you have to survive!  You usually have a runner, a cook and a scavenger (sometime you could start with a female character instead of the scavenger, but she is good in trading).   During the day, you build equipments, tools and others. During the night you go scavenging to collect items like foods, wood, weapons or other materials.   Visually, it is well done and you get the atmosphere of being in a war zone. To be honest, at first it remind me of Deadlight (how it looks) but without the Zombies.  You really need to look after you people in this one to be able to go to the next day. Making the wrong choice or not getting food can get you characters depressed or even broken.   I only played 3 hours and will definitely play it again.  Positive:  • Good concept (War zone) / No zombies • Visually polished and run smoothly • Plenty things to do  Negative:  • A bit repetitive  Overall, I enjoyed it.

            "review_text": "When   This War of Mine   starts, the game delivers unto you three lost souls who've banded together to try and survive the Eastern European civil war that surrounds them. They're civilians—not survival-trained, battle-hardened soldiers—and ill-equipped to suddenly live without running water, heat or readily available food. During the daytime, you manage their actions inside a cracked, multilevel structure. It's barely livable at the onset, with holes in the walls and piles of rubble obstructing part of the building. Command them to dig through rubble and you'll open up more space and start finding organic and scrap materials that will help them scrape by day to day.  Your initial trio of survivors start off hungry, tired or wounded and, no matter how much scavenging, bartering or crafting as you do, those states of being are never too far away. Just to make your shelter moderately livable, you'll have to have them patch walls, build beds, grow vegetables, filter rainwater, bait and catch small animals for food.  The game is hard and sometimes disturbing because it makes you feel the grief of war. Make life-and-death decisions driven by your conscience. Try to protect everybody from your shelter or sacrifice some of them for longer-term survival.  Key Features:  - Inspired by real-life events - Control your survivors and manage your shelter - Craft weapons, alcohol, beds or stoves – anything that helps you survive - Make decisions - an often unforgiving and emotionally difficult experience - Randomized world and characters every time you start a new game - Charcoal-stylized aesthetics to complement the game's theme    THE GOOD   - Distinct, dismal pencil art style - Powerful examination of civilian life in wartime - Complicated &amp; challenging morality    THE BAD   - Becomes monotonous after a time - Autosaves only - Some systems are a bit too easily exploited  DISASTER | BAD | MEDIOCRE | OKAY | GOOD |   GREAT   | AMAZING | MASTERPIECE",

You don't judge the person right away (even though first impressions leave a big impact!), so you stick around, treat them nice, hope they treat you well in return. Basically, this game has been a wonderful date. We even had discussions of marriage, briefly. The only problem is, she called me overly emotional and attached. Though I liked to work through all our problems together well, she has continuously made me cry and feel depressed. So we are on a break.   In reality, this game is a slice of that. It hits home hard where the heart is. If you play this game without exhibiting any empathy/sympathy for these characters in the game you grow attached to, then you are either a sociopath or you have a painful past that requires therapy and not this game.  You try so hard to be a hero, the leader. Making decisions. Who goes, who stays. Who can eat today. Who needs the medicine more. Do we need a bed or grow tobacco for trading goods? Every decision matters. Every death matters. Every consequence is dire and prolongs the torment of being dragged away from the light at the end of the tunnel--only to find out the light at the end of that tunnel is inevitably more pain and death. If this game was in 1st person (full immersion), I would probably kill myself from the pain.   I love these developers, I love the animation, I love the gameplay and style and the somber music.   I have trouble with the controls sometimes when ya want them to do an action or go somewhere especially in a moment of danger and necessity, but it is forgivable because you die anyway.   Get now.",

Those stuff, are the 3 examples of the situations you're going to see in this game. You need to choose a very tough decission. You may use your instinct to do that, but you'll regret it later. If you killed a guy, it will give your survivor(s) a morale hit. If the situations are worsen, they might commit suicide and the game ends.   The game provides an experience of war seen from an entirely new angle. There aren´t just soldiers fighting for their lives, there are groups of civilians too, fighting for their own life. Struggling with lack of food, medicine and constant danger from snipers and hostile scavengers. You can't change the way the world works, but the world will push you to change the way you live. This game will show who you truly are. In the end of the day, as long as you live on this planet, you will realise, you are not as nice as you thought.  TL;DR : Whatever decission i chose in the game, it gives my men and I a morale hit and makes me think what i have done to my life.

The choices only get harder as time moves forward, and sometimes the lines between right and wrong become blurred when it comes to surviving. Are you a good? Are you bad? It really comes down to if you're going to see another day.  The first time of deciding should I bring home some scraps to build an upgraded stove, or the extra herbs to make some medicine for a member of my group who was wounded in a raid alone was a hard choice to make in the longevity of my groups survival.

Many games use this as a goal, however This War of Mine brilliantly and impressively conveys the realism whilst having very simple gameplay.

Very fun and compelling, it's definitely got that 'one more turn' feel that great games have and couples it with some choices you won't make in other games like 'these cigarettes I just rolled... do I let my group smoke them all or do I take them over to the bombed out hotel to trade them for rat meat?' I can see how parts of it might get repetitive after a while, but most games do. I'm finding it highly entertaining if a little bit depressing. I definitely recommend it.  Edit/Addition 16 hours in: I've been asked if it's fun. It's 'fun' like Schindler's List was fun. Ok... not exactly like that but it's dark, it's depressing, and sometimes your game ends by having your last surviving character reach a point where she just can't take it any more and slits her wrists. Is that 'fun?' I don't know. But it's making me think like few games ever have, and for me that's an amazing experience.",

Every day you're faced with moral choices - those are the realities of war.  If you've played 'Rebuild' on iOS - an almost similar game set in a zombie infested world. There you're tasks to survive, rebuild your camp, while fighting zombies. If you love that, you'll probably love this too.",

Full of atmosphere, tugs at your emotional heart strings, and I found myself craving for the next night time mission, but when it came, I was scared to go because I knew how important the success of the mission would be. Until you play, you won't understand.  Staying detached from ones characters is near impossible, and when they die it feels like your own survival is coming to an end, but a new character turns up, and spirits are lifted. But during the night you get raided, someone gets killed and your supplies are stolen! There are not many high points in this game, but its addictive as hell, and if you suffer from depression, don't play this game!",

            "review_text": "This game is without question, one of the hardest games I have ever played in my life. Not due to difficulty spikes though the game does have its fair share of those but rather its one of the hardest games I've ever played due to the overall soul crushing tone this game has. More than multiple times I had to stop playing as I felt my willpower and strength drain away watching my survivors slowly dying as joy and hope turned to ruin much like their own surroundings.  You play as 3 survivors in a half destroyed building during a fictional war somewhere most likely in Europe for a good 4 to 6 weeks trying to survive. Each survivor has their own unique use to the player such as better cooking, trading skills, to playing the guitar, or in one survior's case being good with children which isnt all that useful. This works well for realism of this game as not everyone you come across is going to be helpful to you much like in real life and really sinks in the fact that at the end of the day these are normal people who are not really prepared for the brutality of war.  After you start your game with your 3 survivors there are no tutorials for what you are to do which would be a negative save for the icons for all your actions are rather easy to figure out. You start breaking down rubble and locks on your doors to get to cabinets and dressers which may have useful materials,parts, food, medicine, or ammo all of which are nessessary to survive.   The real challenge in the game is proper management of resources. Do you burn a book for fuel for a heater? Do you build a patch in the wall now or save your supplies for an useful upgrade? Do you trade your last bandages for some food so you dont starve? Not every choice is gonna have a clear answer and what may pay off in the short term can and will mess you up down the line.  Another challenge is nighttime the second part of the game where one survivor must venture out to the bombed out city and scavenge for supplies. The very beginning areas are generous but eventually you're gonna have to go to hostile areas and attack bandits, soldiers, and rebels. It is best to avoid all combat when you can not because of the combat mechanics they are simple and work fine. It's more so most of your survivors are not soldiers they are civilians fighting more than one person at a time will more than likely end in your death especially if they have guns.  The final challenge is morality as this game will test everything you believe in and push them to its limits. I was astonished at how quickly my willpower faded within the first few weeks of playing. Within one week I had debated robbing an old couples house, killing everyone in the church, killed a vicious psychopath, gave away life saving medicine to a bunch of kids, prevented a soldier from ♥♥♥♥♥♥ a woman, and nearly died raiding a sniper junction.   This game is going to hurt you if you are the kind of person who gets emotional playing video games. You have to go in knowing full well everyone you are playing as is more than likely going to die and that all of your best efforts are going to be for nothing. There is no quick save either so no restarting if you didn't like how recent events turned out. The game benefits from this though as a quick save would've ruined all immersion with the game. This is one of those 'Live and learn' games where you'll have to learn from previous mistakes as it is unlikely to be able to a complete playthrough on the first try.   However there is a beauty in this game, its art direction looks serene with pencil drawn monochromatic color scheme fitting the tone well and simple music in the background adding to the overall atmosphere. Your survivors have their own backstories and even multiple endings depending on if they survive, overall happiness, or if they died either by the winter, lack of food, or if they take their own life.  Ultimately i only have one issue with the game and that is taking only one survivor to scavenge at night. Everything else is close to perfection. I give the game 4.5 out of 5 and recommend this to everyone interested in the intial premise. If you can handle the depressing tone and heavy consequences This War Of Mine offers then it deserves a spot in your library.",

            "review_text": "This game is one of the best I’ve seen this year. Challenging, interesting, and heartbreaking, This War of Mine puts you in the battlefield, as a civilian struggling to stay alive. I have many stories I could share but I dont want to spoil much about the layout of the game so after you read this review, buy it, and play it so you can see for yourself.  Graphics- 9/10. Love the 2.5 d graphics with a pencil shade to them. It looks like the trailer (one with soldiers running) when you zoom in close with maxed settings.   Controls- 8/10. Point-and-Click, I’ll explain why only 8 in a bit.  Handling- 9/10. Sometimes when clicking on a character to move him/her you move a previously selected character to their position… A little annoying but not the worst thing ever. Still, otherwise the looting system works fenomonomly.   Story- 7/10. Simple with background stories, but I wish there was more. I don’t know why. There is a radio with news on the war, interactive characters, and backstories but I wish there was like a cutscene or two of the arrival and departure of your shelter...  Gameplay- 8/10. 60% of game is looting/running around, 25% crafting/building, 5% trading… And then theres combat, the last crappy 10% that makes some people leave this game alone forever because they are trigger happy. Ok, let me explain fact from fiction;     Facts: -Combat is (or so it seems) a 50/50 chance when not a sneak attack. -When you go to hit someone (not sneak) they most likely will hit you first because you are running at them (people don’t understand this) -Sneak attacks when hiding behind something (symbol with guy peeking around a corner) and using a knife/axe/shovel/ is a silent insta kill. -In cover you are still able to get hit and can be seen. -If you fall down you should run because the opponent will be able to get a few hits in on you with his weapon and vise versa. -Shooting with guns is accurate and you can only shoot/hit people. -When right in front of someone with a gun they won't shoot you but they will hit you and vise versa. -Character sometimes will run up to the person you are attacking and do nothing (melee only).   Fiction: -Sneaking does not work. Only one character is silent. At a close range people will otherwise hear you and if you can see them they can see you.  Ok now I want to talk about looting;  You can only bring one person to loot because if you could bring more then when you encounter hostels you would have to switch between both characters and that would be frustrating. After clearing an area, just go back and loot the crap out of it every night, but be careful because sometimes other people might take shelter there. I don’t know why people criticize the looting system because it is easy and fun in my opinion.  Creativity- 10/10. I’ve never seen a Call of Duty or any other war game with people playing as a civilian and having to look for food/necessities.  Price-10/10. Worth the price and the money supports the war child fund.  Hype-9/10. Above what I thought it would be but the combat is a serious downer.   Overall- 8.5/10. Without the combat issues or a future update this game could get the first 9/10 I’ve ever given!  I think know why [some] people don’t like this game. The combat, BUT these people are choosing to fight while they could trade and loot and create items to survive. People say you need to kill to survive in this game but thats not true. It just is easier that way. You will steal a few times but will be mostly from bandits and robbers. DONT TURN AWAY BECAUSE OF THIS FLAW!!! Like I said, about a 50/50 shot unless you have patience which i’m sure these down raters don't have… Anyway feel free to ask me questions about the game in the comments. Do note that I finished the game before posting this review. Good luck and have fun!!!",

This game features an amazing amount of replayability. I was skeptical at first. And of course, many elements of this game are scripted. However the AI responses, random events, and random attacks generate hours upon hours of gameplay. This game will do some damage to your social life; so be ready for that.  The characters have some interesting biographies and personalities, both of which show despite the lack of any voiceovers. Despite being a side scrolling game the environments are very nice and immersive. The locations are logical and the feels are frequent. Such feels.  Combat is a bit difficult to understand and predict, at some points it can be very frustrating; and it's best simply to choose a stealthish dirty fighting approach, letting the enemies give chase and then hiding and waiting for them to catch up so you can jump out and beat them to death.  HOWEVER; there is a very steep learning curve, you are basically thrown into the game without any guidelines besides characters whining.  9.5/10  + Good writing + Immersive Environments + Good barter system + Base building is fun and crucial  - No tutorial - Lack of direct controls may get your characters injured/killed",

I've played 6 times and I've beaten the game twice; once with Pavle, Marko, and Bruno where I took in Boris. And once with Pavle and Marlin where I took in the Child Lover (Yvelta or something?) starting in Winter. People say the combat is clunky but I haven't had a problem with it you're killed very easily unless you have either the element of surprise, or an easily defencible position such as on top of a ladder. Finding parts to upgrade your shelter is difficult, and being raided is a huge danger, and unless you fortify your shelter and find a gun you'll almost always lose a few items. After playing about 13 hours the game has seemed to get repetetive and this is the only negative aspect i've found in it.   This game is a challenge and requires strategy to beat it. You won't always be able to help the children who come to the door asking for medicine, the starving people you meet while scavenging, or be able to help your neighbors out of a tough situation. And your characters will get sad very sad. But i'd recommend it because it is an interesting experience that accuretely depicts a survival situation where you need to make tough choices in order to survive.",

            "review_text": "With how bleak the game is I got the feeling the game wasn't supposed to be fun but an exploration of the horror of war for civilians, so I ended up feeling kinda guilty when I actually enjoyed it a lot  You take control of a group of 4 civilian survivors in an eastern european city. The city has been taken over by some kind of rebel army and the military is beseiging the city to reclaim it. The objective is to keep the survivors alive for about 6 weeks til the war ends.  During the day it plays like The Sims. You build furniture and tools, cook, eat, sleep, and sometimes conduct trade with wandering traders or make choices as to whether to aid visitors who come for help  At night you pick a survivor to travel to one of a number of locations and loot as much as he/she can carry to aid you during the day or future raids before dawn  You will need to find materials to build furniture and defenses or to use as fuel for heating during the winter, food to not die from not eating, water to cook, medicine in case of illness or inury, weapons and ammo to defend during the night or utilise in raids, and trade goods like tobacco or alcohol to trade with wandering traders  Players can craft items and weapons such as a shiv for combat, a crowbar for forcing locks loudly, lockpick for picking them silently once, spade for clearing rubble, saw for sawing through barricades doors etc. Often an area will have locked doors or collapsed passages and players must plan ahead for future raids to ensure they can clear the obstacles they couldnt pass earlier  When raiding you may encounter hostile people. Some of them are thugs and bandits who are fair game. Others are innocent survivors who may fight to defend themselves or their property, and there are soldiers who are usualyl lethally dangerous and best avoided. Combat is random and depends on the skills the survivor started with and their equipment and the strenght of their foe, and whether or not you or your opponent is injured already and who got the drop on who. As combat is dangerous and injuries take many days to heal and expensive bandages, combat is best avoided. Not all survivors are hostile and some will trade or assist the player. Others must be avoided carefully or killed if the situation is desperate as the player searches for the most valuable items for their inventory space in the time available  Death is permanent so the player must weigh up the risks and benefits of each action. Do you attempt to sneak past the thugs for the food you need not to starve? Do you steal medicine from an old couple to save your sick friend? Do you try to save a woman from a battle hardened well equipped ♥♥♥♥♥♥ soldier who will almost certainly kill you? Do you pick through the looted carcass of a supermarkt for those last scraps of materials or risk your life sneaking into the rich but bandit infested warehouse district?  Really I loved this game.

            "review_text": "To start off, let's talk about the artwork of the game. For being a sidescrolling click and point, it does have a sense of dark, somber beauty. Much like Limbo, the game has a bit of a darker visual aspect, leading to the automatic connection of absolute despair. Character models are fairly well developed and the environments are put together in a way that feels war-torn. While you won't see every brick your survivors are moving, visually, it does a fantastic job of setting the scene.  The soundtrack for this game is one of the few players might not automatically turn off. The music score to this little gem is outstanding and again, definitely helps set the tone for the world they'll find themselves exploring. The general sound effects are also nicely done, players are never long forgetting that the reality is that of mortars, snipers, and machine guns.  As stated above, it is a point and click survival game, ran in real time. Players will have a certain amount of hours (roughly 10 minutes of actual time, I believe) for survivors to build, cook, eat, catch up on extra sleep, etc. At night, players will have to send someone out for supplies, while maintaining a defense and resting up extra survivors. Sleep deprivation is an extremely dangerous reality and can affect numerous things from speed, to combat capability.  This is where the moral issues arise, when players find themselves desperate for food or materials to simply light a fire. Yes, they could attempt to break into that military base that has a fully stocked kitchen and extra niceties scattered about, but is it worth the danger? On the other hand, perhaps that group of well armed thugs needs to shuffle the mortal coil, as it were. Then again, maybe players find themselves outside the homes of couples and survivors that simply want to try to make the best of things - surely you couldn't steal from the sick, elderly, or infirm, right?  Those are the choices 'This War of Mine' puts players in, every time you go out to find resources, you'll be denying them to someone else. Very few areas of the world are abandoned, there will be no shortage of military or rebel forces, as well as local militias and bandits. Of course, there are those that wish to trade for your goods as well, if you've got what they need.  But that's where I found a few flaws with the game, or maybe a few flaws with myself. The game gives you no options, there's no choice, it's steal/kill or die. Even in my attempts to quickly set up an industry of sorts, to become self-sufficient in at least one aspect to lighten the load, I found myself always at odds with my resources. That's a very good thing, however (and this is the big one for me) the game inherently believes characters to be of 'good' nature.  If you find yourself in a situation of fight or flight, the combat system is fairly simplistic but you'll likely find it easier to ambush your targets. But be warned!, each 'innocent' you kill leads your whole group into depression - every 'innocent' you steal from affects morale as well. Oh, and speaking of stealing, there's only two ways to handle NPCs. Either leave them alone (and if you're a 'bandit', they'll flee) or kill them. There's no option for stickups, you /have/ to murder. But again, even if you were simply defending yourself, if they weren't a brigand or military, your characters will suffer.  That's where I have my biggest concern with the game. I understand that the game wants players to be 'good' but when every choice you make is generally 'the best of the worst' and your characters are constantly falling into depression (or broken) status, it puts a spin on the game that just isn't, in my opinion, totally necessary. Yes, the death(s) maybe should hang on the character that performed the deed, but it /is/ war. War is ugly, and 'This War of Mine' pulls no punches in reminding us of that.   Overall 9/10 This game really wants me to like it, and I do absolutely like it and highly recommend it to others. I just have issues with it's moral areas - But then again, maybe that's something with me, not the game.",

            "review_text": "Joined together by fate, three victims of war decided upon a torn down building as their new shelter for the post apocalyptic tragedy they must endure. Time is of the essence as they brought down piles of junk to scavenge as much as they could. Collecting scraps of wood, left over first aid kits and dried meat; anything that helped them survive another day would be an uplifting gift in this terrible place they used to call home. After rallying together of what they could, one of the members has decided that a local abandoned home should have the necessities for them to begin their survival. Confused, distraught and still struggling of what to do in this new world of hopelessness. Pavle began his first steps up towards a heavily-shelled home across the street. He peered through every door that was ajar, only to find the single creature inhabiting this home was a rat that looked starved as he was. Taking what he could, Pavle gathered wood and scraps of leftover food as he headed back towards shelter. He realized that this would become his new job, and prayed that the military would someday save him.  Greeted by the echoes of his footsteps, Pavle sets aside the new-found materials for Bruno to make use of. Pavle knew he wasn’t smart, nor did he have the social aspects to ever fit in with his colleagues. As his facial features often confused people that he was always angry. However he always deemed himself an optimistic character, with a lean and fit physique that allowed him to compete in sporting competitions.  Unfortunately Bruno was the complete opposite. Smart, overweight, unhealthy smoker, unsympathetic, but nevertheless a chiseled chef. An intensive scholar in the culinary arts, Bruno believes this was his time to show his skills for the purpose of survival. Katia remained upstairs in one of the bedrooms as she fell ill during the war. Thankfully Pavle was able to come back with fever medications on the way back from the scavenge. With no medical supplies going through the borders due to war conflicts, she was left with a fever that eventually developed into many days of sleepless nights and exhaustion. Katia broke down in tears, relieved and outraged that a solution to her pain was only few houses away. But with the paranoia of being shot by militia, there was no chance she would try to wander alone. Bruno would have left her to die, but her plea for help wasn’t a plea. It was a bargain, never has Bruno ever seen someone with nothing but a thin strand supporting their life-line; can convince him to help such a person. He was convinced to help this woman, as he found her characteristics one day could be useful against merchants. Weeks have passed as scavenging, falling ill, and single meals a day were a tireless struggle for survival. Often there was not enough food for two people, and a decision was made that the person off night-guard was the one who skipped a meal for a deal of 6 hours of sleep that night.  Not too long ago, a young man in his 20’s requested shelter in their home named Roman. Roman was a former militia but Bruno wasn’t willing to let out personal details of his past to the others. Bruno, being the conniving chef that he was, set Roman off to raid the home that was just on the outskirts of war. He told them that the occupants of the house were corrupted soldiers and that opening fire through the front door would guarantee for bullets to catch most of them.  Roman performed what he was told. Roman didn’t know what lied behind those doors except knowing there were soldiers ready to kill. Roman opened fire until the voices behind were silent. He heard nothing but ringing in his ears. Finally opening the door, he realized what he had done. Gathering what was left of the home, he came back with two days of food, and supplies that would guarantee a new contraption that would help on the fight for survival.  Greeted by the warm light what now was home, Roman felt nothing of it. He simply took his rewarded dinner and headed upstairs. Katia despite her business approach to every situation, felt there was more to Roman’s scavenge that night than just a raid. She was expecting Roman to stay behind closed doors for a while, but to her surprise. He did not. He told her everything.  Katia couldn’t believe it. She didn’t want any of this. She hoped that the military wouldn’t find out or they would be executed on the spot.  Roman is now found guilty for slaughtering an elderly couple. They died being ripped to shreds by bullets as they sat next to the fireplace.  This was too much for her and felt this needed to be discussed with everyone else.  Pavle wasn’t able to comprehend the situation, he turned his head and pretended it never happened. Bruno had no words to say.  The next morning, Roman was found kicking and beating Bruno down the steps of the house. Half his life bar remained as Katia tried to restrain Roman from continuing any further. Words were still being thrown at Bruno as he Bruno tried escaping from his wrath. Roman felt hopeless.  As Katia left to be chosen for the nightly scavenge, Roman hung himself that night.  Everyone was devastated except Bruno. He simply felt sad that there were no cigarettes left in the cabinet. Katia was found upstairs again having a mental breakdown. Pavle refused to get out from bed as well. Low on food, Bruno knew he had to do the scavenging tonight.  Although as Bruno walked up the door, a stranger on the other side knocked.

You can trade with people that come over to your hide out or send your own during nights to trade with others, if you cant trade and supplys are running low you feel desperation as you dont have any guns to fight the thugs so your actions might lead to raid elderly familys from their supplys and foods and leave them to die insted.   Crafting the right tools for the right time and careful planing a head will lead you far yet make the wrong choise and waste your resources and you will be in grave danger.  Note:if you have food i suggest dont let it hang for too long because if you get raided the raiders will aim for it! so feed your men when you can!  you can help people or you can turn your back to them, and it puts you through the testing your self what would you do in harsh world like this.   definatly give this game 10/10 .",

It is also a refreshing change from other games where you have an entire armoury at your disposal and you run around shooting.

            "review_text": "This game is by far one of my fav games of 2014. This War of Mine well take your soul down a road that well show what kind of person you really are. To explain this i would like to tell you a story about my first game play exp. It started off with three civi survivors of a brutal war, Two males and a female. I decided to take my female to the church my first night and see if I can recieve any help and get a feel for the game. I arrived at the church to find a priest, where I proceeded to speak to him where he informed me he cant help because he was robbed earlier. I decided to take a look around the church not steeling anything just looking around, when I opened a door into their kitchen i was approached by the priest and his 'crew' where they then proceeded to beat my character until she was dead. I woke up on day two with only two characters left who are now depressed because of thier loss. Now knowing what I know I decided to take the approach I wanted to take in the first place, I'm going to look out for number one and number one only. I speant the next two days stealing supplys from every where i could to keep my remaining two characters alive. on day 4 I found a super market, inside I found food, water, matts, and two people talking, a male soldier and a female civi. The civi was looking for food and asked the soldier for help. He said he would help but he wants something in return, and that something is sex. she said no and he then proceeded to hit her and drag her out back to take what he wanted. not wanting to lose my supplies I left her to to the will of that soldier and his perverse ways. On day 5 I sent out to look for more supplies in some houses because my other character I left back at the shelter was becoming sick and needed meds but i was caught and they shot my character in back while trying to escape.. I woke up on day 6 with one character left who is now getting really sick. There where some houses with low threat and lots of food and meds so i decided to head there in a last ditch attepmt to stay alive. When I arived I found two very old folks a man and his very sick wife living there. He came up to me and asked what I needed and if I could leave him and his sick wife alone. They where just robbed and didnt have much left he said, but needing meds i decided to rob this old man and his wife blind stealing everything they had, he begged and begged me not to take the meds so his wife would live but i stole them any ways. When I got home back to the shelter my character became very depressed, disqusted with his actions of robbing that old couple. Day 7 would become my last day. Completely disqusted with his actions, his loses, and the way the world is, my last character hung him self and commited suicide ending the game. Because of all that I realized I have dark cold heart because after that hole ordeal if I was that last guy that hole ordeal would not have ♥♥♥♥ed me up that bad haha but to each his own. Great game, Great Story, Good Graphics, and hours upon hours of fun 10/10",

At first, I was kinda skeptical paying $25 (at the time) for this game, but I thought 'Hey, why not?' And I have absolutely no regrets. The gritty survival aspects, sick survivors, injured people on the roads, other survivors needing your help. It took me a while to get used to the controls and mechanics, but when I did I was completely engrossed in the game. The characters feeling so relateable and immersive, I feel like I'm actually there; often finding myself trying to console them, even knowing they are unable to hear me.  The characters just feel so real, you know? Like you're actually there.  At one point, I needed food. I decided to raid a small cottage. The old couple were there, begging me not to hurt them nor steal from them. I just wanted them to be quiet. I didn't mean to kill him. I just wanted to make him quiet. I killed him. His wife slouched over his body in dismay, I immediately ran. I actually felt my eyes well up as she ran over to him. Marco just... drunk. And drunk. And drunk. A bunch of pencilesque pixels on the screen had never had any emotional effect on me until I played this game.  My only regret, if any, would not be being able to buy this game and the War Child DLC more than once.",

            "review_text": "Graphics: 2D setup that combines the detail of Shadow Complex and the art style of Limbo. Everything is dark and brooding, which really sets the overall tone. Their lighting system is a thing of beauty as well: rays of light shine through broken walls and windows, fire barrels give a nice ominous glow in the night.  Audio: Somber acoustic guitar soundscapes reminiscent of The Last Of Us play during the day, and the night scavenging missions feature very tense, suspenseful string and synth arrangements. Environmental sound effects like artillery shells landing and the crack of sniper fire constantly remind you that you're never really safe.  Controls: Point and click adventure style. You navigate around the environment by clicking where you want to go, objects you can interact with in the environment have their own separate icon. While in the safehouse, you control each character independently by selecting their character photo then giving them their own commands. Navigating the menu system is simple and straightforward.  Gameplay: Everything is randomly generated at the start, so no play through is the same. The safehouse sequences are fairly routine. Build this, repair that, eat, rest. The game really comes alive when night falls and you have to decide what to do with your survivors. Sickness, hunger, and injury are very serious threats to your group, and losing anyone significantly increases your risk of having the whole thing come crashing down on you. Managing your survivors is key to getting through the siege. There's also significant danger when it comes to the overall scavenging: rolling over those weaker than you and taking everything they have makes you a target for vigilantes and decreases morale, and some of the more well-stocked areas tend to be heavily guarded by hostile military forces and other survivor groups who have no compunctions about killing anyone who sets foot on their turf.  My one major complaint is the lack of a tutorial or tool hints on the environmental icons. It doesn't take too long to figure stuff out, but the initial learning curve can lead to some restarts. There are very few bugs, which is always a plus.  Overall Score: 9/10",

            "review_text": "You could go the easy route and describe This War of Mine as 'The Sims, but set in Hell.' And you'd be right.  The game can be better described as an 'entropy simulator': There's plenty of things to pick up initially. Just through initial walks through the area you can find a bunch of resources you can use for initial improvements to make for your war hovel. But eventually, that stuff will start to run out, and you will not be able to play it safe anymore. If you're smart, you'll have someone who is good at bartering and items to supply the demands of rich survivors with, and you might be able to get through the war without blood on your hands.  If you're no longer able to play it safe, that is where the real This War of Mine begins.  It is easy to lose control of your circumstances concerning what your group needs. If you have to keep pushing your wounded and your sick, they will get worse. But there's points where you just can't, because you need to keep a tight budget on what little resources you have. Raiders will come by, you will get a small winter, and your group members will get hideously depressed from having to hide from the war in a cold, destroyed house. All of these things will add up, and not having what you need to keep them sane and healthy will eventually destroy your chances of seeing the end of the game.   You'll have to be a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to get what you need, and the mental tax that your actions will cause will be heavy. Sure, you can poke your scavenging survivor to stab an armed thug in the back, but he will hate himself for it the next day. You can brandish your pistol at the elderly couple hiding out in their nice home to take their supplies. You can carefully sneak through homes and take things that survivors not unlike yourself have been hoarding for a rainy day, putting them in poverty to get what your group needs. And, of course, you can sneak through shadows and stab people in the back, trying to ignore their frightened pleads as you put the blade in to keep others from noticing all for the sake of some things you could have, in better days, gotten from a supermarket for five dollars.  This game is one of those games where it can make you feel like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for trying to survive, and the more desperate you have to get to feed your group, the more it works. It's a horrible ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ feeling generator when the game is at it's toughest.",

Obstacles include: managing starvation due to limited food supply, moral choices between killing and letting survive, helping NPC neighbors by giving resources or turning them down, and battling injuries and disease. The game also features crafting as an important part of the game. It's important because it reduces resources needed, enhances weapons and tools, helps with defense of your home from raids at night, and helps fight fatigue and hunger.

Do you use the wood for fuel to stave off the cold, or do you board up your walls to protect against bandits? Can we really spare the last of our meds on an old man who will probably die anyway? Combat is messy, often unexpected, and traumatizing.   You will not encounter very many fail-states in this game, as that would be contrary to the theme of desperate survival.

If you play correctly though you can manage to keep all of your people alive throughout the war and generally feel good about yourself afterwards, or you can have all your people either kill themselves or be killed and feel incredibly bad about yourself later, your choice. 10/10 story and gameplay.",

            "review_text": "This War of Mine tries, and arguably does a good job, to create a realistic take on what life is like for those that have to survive the war instead of 'merely' fighting in it.  The game puts the player in the role of one or more civilians stuck in a besieged city in which they're forced to survive until a peacekeeping force can intervene and break the blockade. Sounds easy right?  WRONG  You're not playing as some legendary war hero posse capable of breaking sieges, nor are you immune to the wear and tear of daily life. Hunger will kill you as surely as a kitchen knife in the ribs, and you won't miraculously shrug off shotgun fire after ducking behind a door for a couple of seconds.  No. You're playing as a rather diverse group of civilians, each with their own skills, moral code, beliefs and strengths and weaknesses. Some can carry a lot, others not so much. Some people will gladly knife some fool for a can of meat, others will sink into depression after stealing a bottle of water. And to top it off there's no easy 'reload last save' button to bail you out of terrible choices. Go forward or start again.  Now, this might all sound well and good, but what does this game truly offer you might ask?  This War of Mine, boiled to its essence, is a survival simulator on a day/night cycled basis that focuses on resource management and moral choices. Each day you're stuck in your shelter doing daily tasks like building furniture, crafting tools, making meals or alcoholic beverages, handling visitors and the likes. At night comes the true test: do you venture out into the city proper and try and scavenge what you need to survive? Locations offer a whole variety of loot, events and choices. You might find a trader. or bandits without qualms about filling you full of lead. Maybe it's just an abandoned house full of stuff ripe for the taking instead?   For those that rather have bullet points about what might attract you or turn you off instead:  The Good: -&gt; Decisions carry weight. Killing, stealing, getting sick/wounded, helping people all have their good and bad results and oftentimes they feel meaningful, even if it's way down the line. That girl you saved from a collapsed building might show up a week later to reward you for your actions, or that stuff you stole from an aid drop might attract investigating soldiers...  -&gt; Lots of choices to be made across the game. Raid every night? Live as looters? Be self-sufficient? Start a cigarette trading setup? Be the local booze dealer? You can succeed in many ways indeed.  -&gt; Plenty of events, locations to scavenge and people to meet(Or murder). Many locations also offer multiple scenarios, so no playthrough is ever the same.  -&gt; While kind of bugged right now, the game features workshop/mod support and can be customised to a reasonable degree at the moment.  -&gt; It's easy to start caring for what your survivors do and get immersed in their plight.  The Love/Hate parts:  -&gt; No save/load. Some applaud it(I do in this case) but it might turn you off. It does make your choices feel more rewarding/punishing though!  -&gt; While there's a lot of replayability, once you've got the 'minmax super build order' memorized the game starts losing its challenge very fast, but if you start doing (self imposed or premade) challenges things might spike up again.  -&gt; The combat/scavenging will be a love or hate relationship. Some feel it's good enough while others think it's way too gamey. AI standing before a hidey-hole wondering why you went up in smoke might get old fast.   The 'Maybe skip on this' part:  -&gt; Bugs. The game is buggy, and while the devs try/tried(Unsure if they're still actively trying to fix everything) to fix bugs there are still some pretty annoying ones left. E.G. if you're in Hotel-Bandit version, the game thinks you're in the Hotel-Friendlies version and believes you're stealing(Same with e.g. the Church and Apartments).   -&gt; Exploits are in the game. Sure, you can opt not to use them, but be forewarned. Katia approves of giving her two bottles of pills and a medkit for her two bottles of pills!  -&gt; AI can be pretty terrible at times, failing to use doors, taking long routes around or occasionally getting x-ray sight.  -&gt; Steep learning curve that once mastered makes the default game a cakewalk.  -&gt; Game has lots of options but little variety. E.G. While the Construction Site has two versions that can trigger, those versions will ALWAYS have the same amount of enemies, the same events, etc.   In summary: A glowing recommendation if you like immersive survival war-themed games with a bit of management sprinkled over it. A cautious recommendation if you're a fan of just survival, just war-themed games or just immersive games. A Big NO if you can't handle a tough start, bugs, a lack of save/load options, thinking ahead, handling consequences or human emotions. ",

            "review_text": "This War of Mine involves a group of civilians who take shelter in a damaged and war-torn building in an attempt to survive the horrors of a besieged city in war-time. You control the group of survivors who are struggling to survive and it is your duty to ensure that they do, no matter what it takes.  Pros: + Beautiful graphics: illustrates war to perfection through visual themes.  + Realistic gameplay: Decisions made WILL impact the group and affect them in different ways.  + Each survivor has their own 'ability' and 'trait': For example, Bruno is a good cook and will use less supplies to cook meals. But, he is also a smoker, so he enjoys cigarettes and can rely on them to restore bad moods. Thus, meaning that you will be tempted to gather cigarettes when scavenging.  + Trading: Different civilians in the city will value supplies differently, depending on their needs. Very realistic.  + Emotive: This War of Mine does a fantastic job in making you feel guilty if you make an evil decision to gain supplies.  + Random events: Some days, people will come to your front door requesting assistance. This adds another realistic aspect and requires some decision making about whether or not to help them. These also happen during scavenging, as you can sometimes find people being attacked by military at some locations and you can decide whether or not to help them. There are consequences to every action you make.  + Risks: Mostly, everything is a risk. From scavanging at night and potentially being killed, from sending out a group member to help someone. You either reap the rewards or regret accepting the mission.  + Mood effects: Your surviviors can become depressed if you do too many evil acts, such as stealing or not helping people. An example of this would be killing someone for supplies, the group will learn of this act and have different opinions on it, such as not caring at all or feeling responsible. The killer is also impacted, as they can even commit suicide through guilt if you're not careful. Some survivors can even steal from you and leave the shelter if they become unhappy. However, making good decisions like helping civilians will boost your survivors morale and ensure they stay at the shelter.  + Night: The night is done to perfection. You can only send one survivor out to scavenge to ruins of the city while the rest can either sleep or stay on guard. There is also a chance of people raiding your shelter and stealing supplies or even killing/wounding your survivors, depending on how well you have fortified your shelter. This adds a great deal of tension to the following mornings after scavenging as you may be left without any supplies.  + Construction: There is a vast array of many different things to construct in the game, such as vegetable gardens, rainwater collectors and alarm systems. You will always be making decisions about which thing you need to construct the most and will utilise the night scavenging and traders to gather the exact supplies you need and could end up ignoring food and medicine for these parts.  + Replay value: The game does a good job in encouraging you to replay the game with different survivors and see how you fare. Want a challenge? Start in winter.  + Implementation of seasons: In winter, you use a lot more resources in keeping your survivors warm. If you do not, your survivors can freeze to death the following morning or become terminally ill from disease spreading.  + Perfect attention to detail: Simple aspects such as having ill survivors sleeping next to healthy survivors WILL increase the chance of them becoming ill, which I think is a great touch by the developers to add into This War of Mine. Furthermore, adding things like your survivors running slower or becoming depressed if they are wounded/ill is a brilliant touch and is often overlooked.  + Shelter layout: The shelter is completely under your control other than the workbench and fridge and YOU decide where everything is built. This can be utilised well or not at all, depending on the player.  + Large amounts of locations: Night scavenging opens up a variety of different locations for the player to explore, such as hospitals (with doctors working there who can heal you) ruined schools and even military outposts.  + Soundtrack: The game's soundtrack suits the game really well, as it tends to be quite eerie music most of the time: especially at night and has one of the best main menu soundtracks of the games I have played in terms of genre.  + Bugs: There are next to no bugs I encountered whilst playing this game and all the bugs that were found are quickly patched.  + Price: The game is also fairly cheap to buy at around £15 when not on sale, compared to most games nowadays costing around £30-£40.  Cons: - No statistics: This could've been added to make the game almost perfect, as a lot of people (including myself) like to have stats in games telling them, for example, how many overall days they've survived, how many people they've killed etc.  - Late game: Near the end of the game, it does become tedious when you have built everything and are skipping days just to get to the ending.  - Achievements: The achievements do not tell you how to aquire them and require a lot of trial and error to obtain. Some people may like this, however pefectionists may find it to be frustrating at times.  - No difficulty settings: The entire game is based on one difficulty (unless using custom maps). This does limit the game as people can find it to be quite easy and would prefer it to be more difficult, like less supplies to scavenge.  Overall, This War of Mine is a fantastic survival-based game which will thrill you into playing it to death (no pun intended). It utilises the concepts of war and how devastating it can be to engage the player at all times. I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys survival-based games or emotive games that will affect the player's mood, which is uncommon in most games today.",

And this game feels real you feel like a civil war just broke out and your there with your friends. And in some situations you have to make tough choices like you would in one of these situations.   For instence one of the first scavenging location is called 'Quiet House' and when you enter you see and old couple. A man talking to his wife who appears to has alzheimer's and she also appears to be sick and the place is filled with good stuff such as life saving medicine bandages and food. altho theres one problem your robing them beacause the most depressing thing is that the husband follows you around. but not just that when ever you take medical supplies like herbal meds or something like that he begs you not to take that beacause thats his wifes meds.    The most depressing fact is that he doesent do anything but beg he begs you not to take there stuff. Other then that he just watches you walk out the door. And thats not the only time you will be faced with a desicion like that. Its intense beyond all and an emotional rollercoaster.    And thats why i give this game a 10/10 It reflects what happens when a war breaks out in a city theres barely any civilazation any more its just chaos and people doing what they can you survive its just amazing.

            "review_text": "In this review I'll be covering the story, objectives and tone of this great game.    Story   You emerge as a citizen, trapped inside an abandoned home that you now know as safety, along with two or three other people; you've been stuck between war zones where survival and horror cross fade. You are not a soldier and therefore just a survivor. Searching ruble left behind by shelling finding few scraps of food and items. You find cloth to bandage your friends wounds in and antibiotics to help your sickness. You find little useful materials and components to build with, but is enough for a simple hotplate and a makeshift bed to rest bloodied limbs on. You know you can't survive with what you have, you know you need more supplies, but you also know you can't just walk outside with snipers lurking. You wait for night, where you'll travel for supplies in an effort for not just yourself, but the survival of your comrades as well. Risking everything you know you'll have to choose between life or death, starvation or robbery and kindness or murder. There is no choices, only decisions.    Objectives   You play as one or more survivors at once, controlling their separate thoughts and decisions. ' This War of Mine ' plays like ' The Sims ' in a dark horrible way. In order to eat out of your fridge, you must either scavenge for food, steal for it or kill for it. Sometimes you have a choice, others you don't. This game is all about choosing between ultimately life or death. During the day you play as all the characters working towards fixing, improving your safety and health. You need to eat, drink (is automatic), sleep, heal and improvise along with catering to character specific needs such as smoking or drinking coffee. Sometimes you have people during the day that try to trade with you, where you can use your found items to trade with theirs for things you need. Other times you have people whom seek help, medical or physical; good or bad. Once nightfall reaches you have two choices, to stay, or scavenge; by choosing what each persons role for the night is. After this, it's your time to shine, you can scavenge, steal or kill for things such as food, materials, supplies and items. The games pace is repetitive, but the shear pain and suffering to see your characters go through is what compels you to continue, to see hope or a light. Once you come home you can talk to others about your findings, reassure them that you'll survive, offer them food or medical attention. Once you have your resources, it is yours to use it wisely. Just remember, that you're not alone, your death is likely likewise having your own safety attacked and looted from. This game is all about survival, and it shows just that in all the most brutal ways possible during war...    Tone and Emotions   You as the player, will feel the pain and suffering your characters go through. Murdering people feels bad and so does robbing people of their supplies. When your characters feel bad whether its from woundings or from being depressed. You'll feel it with them. ' This War of Mine ] is a harsh game in all ways, and there is no running from it. When a character leaves due to how they feel, or when a character dies because you couldn't do enough; you feel the weight on your shoulders, the sadness and emotions of the other occupants you still have to survive for. This games takes your point of view about war into a whole new perspective, and it is harsh.    Pros and Cons   Overall I think that this is a genuinly great game, it has been a long time where just the gameplay makes me sad or that I feel bad stealing or killing others. Certainly deserves a close look. This concludes my review, I may visit this again if I have things to add.      Pros   Cons          Immersive experience    Brutally honest war    Character emotions are in depth    Scavenging and robbing is great    Stealth is spot on    Inventory system is great    Building and upgrading system is spectacular    Character management is beautiful    Storyline is great    Mechanics overall are pleasing    Music and ambiance is nicely fitting    Graphics are really nice        Wish there were sidescroller controls such as WSAD or arrow keys    Having muti-people scavenging isn't implemented where honestly I would love it    There is no Co-op which would fit really nice with this game    Is repetitive but nice if you understand the story well    Not too many things to build, wish there were things like pool tables or having tables to eat at. Just more objects and items to build in general. (Hint hint developers, bunk beds would be awesome!)      ",

Save a life at the risk of doing something moraly wrong to survive or do u prioritise personal survivial over the lives of others. Be wary though as if you take on too many mouths to feed it may start to fall apart quicker than you think.  A interesting new take on a subject matter that effects many people on a day to day basis, as well as being a rewarding game to play. Challenge yourself to save as many lives as u can and hold out till the war can eventually end? Also contains an neat little crafting system so gather resources to make your hideout more comfortable and heated for the cold winters and stop despair from setting in by fending off other looters.  I would recommend this title simply because its a little bit different and each playthru will be different due to randomly generated items and scenarios meaning some of the more predictable elements in other games are not necessarily found in this one.",

You will get depressed and even be a completely broken person that just can't do anything else. Your mind just crack out of depression and leading you to maybe even worse... This is a point an click game where you'll have to survive in any possible way for an unkown time. You never know when the war will end and it will feel like forever. The combat is really simple wich does not means by anyway that you will succeed on your engagements, on the contrary. You might have to steal, maybe even threaten innocent people or watch hopelessly while a soldier forces a mother to do him a 'service'. Being a nice guy all the time will have it's consequences, so you'll have to really ponder if you really can afford being nice.

Having to kill a old couples 30 year old son and then watching them watch there son... Drop to the floor. Having to steal medical supplies from severely injured people, just to help your group. It does hit you hard in the feelz, doesn't it.  Summary  Pros Character combination choosing 2 different spawn locations Good/Unique Characters Great visualisation Very very VERY hard Repitativity Hard to stop playing Okay trading system  Cons No button to continue after beating game Not enough scavenging locations (3-5 more would be perfect) Horrific fighting system Can only trade Ciggarettes/Moonshine (For narcotics) no Drugs... A little more crafting variations?  This game would be a 10/10 if you could continue after beating the game or possibly fixing the fighting... It's just scary how bad the fighting is....

You don't want to let your group starve, do you? Well let's go scavenge a nearby building for food and supplies. You sneak into the structure, gathering food and building materials to just try and get you buy. You aren't taking everything, heck, you can't even carry that much.   As you're searching through the cabinets for the canned goods and medicine you need, a hostile opens the door to your right and attempts to unload a magazine of ammunition at you. Through quick thinking, you descend down the stairs and wait for him in the dark corner so you can achieve the element of surprise on your well armed oppenent. He rounds the corner, and you stab him until he collapses onto the floor with a gurgling thud. You begin looting his ammunition when you hear more footsteps descending down the stairs. You ready yourself for the second onslaught, but it passes you by an collapses on your former opponents corpse into a sobbing heap. When the red haze of bloodlust clears, you realize that it was an elderly man and his wife. She moans uncontrollably and laments the fact that her love is now gone. He wasn't a hostile looter, he was an elderly man in a secluded building trying to make sure no one stole his sick wifes medication.   You then have an epiphany. You realize that he wasn't an evil doer bent on ending your life. You realize that you, in fact, are the bandit.

Helped everyone who asked for it, took in every survivor (good thing too, because I ended up loosing a lot of them), tried fighting against bandits, was a bad idea. But enough with the debrief, now to the actual review:   My overall feeling about this game is very positive. The theme is unique and the feeling of despair sustains though out the game. At some point during the game the atmosphere got so intensely sad and desperate I had to take a break from it, I consider this to be an amazing achievement from a game.  I suffered 3 bugs during the game that really had an affect on the atmosphere and broke the immersion, but considering that it's an relatively new game from a indie studio it's understandable. Also the bugs didn't break the game and I was able to continue after them, I just hope they get fixed sooner rather than later. :)  The game could have more variety to it, definitely, but again: New game and a indie game, the game itself is a remarkable achievement! An true survivor game and perhaps first of its kind in being a 'war-survivor' game.  The music was good and conveyed the feeling of the game very well, a more variance to the music would have been better though. Especially the radio music got boring quick.  For me the trailer expressed a bit more event rich and intense game than it was, which is more of an rule than exception, but like I said: overall feeling is very positive. This was perhaps one of the best games I've played, but yes it could have been even better. :-)   Played this on apple platform on Christmas holiday, when I get back from the holidays to my PC, I wonder will the save games and achievements be transferable to my PC? We will see.  This War of Mine is a true survivor game with intense atmosphere.",

I find myself skipping entire days just so I can send my one guy with 12 bag spaces back to the same house over and over to collect all the wood (that only piles in stacks of 2) that was available. It's realistic, I guess, but given that it takes a lot of wood to create each item, you'd think they'd be a bit more generous on the stacks.  Overall, I have to say I really enjoy this game.

Addictive for awhile until you learn how to manage your inventory supply, then after 30 days (in game, not realy life, obviously...) when you get the hang of it, it just sort of drags on and becomes repetitive because the story doesn't really go anywhere. If they threw in some scripted missions that you were forced to complete instead of choosing random locations to loot I think that would keep people a lot more interested to continue. I did an 80 day story and I probably would have stopped after about 50 days if I wasn't curious about how the game ends, which to me felt arbitrary and sudden.  To sum up... PROS: Great gameplay mechanics, amazing atmosphere/vibe, decent backstory, good visuals CONS: Choices are irrelevant as long as 1 survivor makes it to the end, would have been nice to send groups to scavenge instead of 1 person, during winter survivors are a bunch of babies who get sick way too easy in none-freezing temps, story ends abruptly, little to no replay value  Overall I'd give a solid 4/5 stars.

            "review_text": "As you can probably guess, This War of Mine is not a fun game. It’s not a game you turn on to relax or clear your mind. But it is a very good game. Part of the appeal of video games is that they can take us to places we’ve never been and that includes places we would never want to be.  You play the game as a number of different civilians who have banded together in an abandoned house to try to wait out the war. You need to find food, medicines in case anyone gets sick or hurt, and fuel to keep warm. There’s also a crafting system that lets you build things that will help you to survive. Everything from beds and stoves, to weapons and ammo, to contraptions that can help you create your own materials – animal traps, rain water collectors, herb gardens. You can also build a radio which gives not only the comfort of music but also news which can help you be prepared for what’s coming next, whether it be cold weather or roving thieves.  The gameplay is fairly simple, but involves a lot of decision-making. During the day your characters can craft items, eat, use medicines, catch up on sleep, or do activities that will relax them, if available. There’s also a chance you’ll have visitors, whether it be people looking to trade or people asking for help. Night time is when scavenging is done. One character can be sent out to look for resources, while the rest stay at the house to either sleep or guard it from hostiles.  There are about a dozen playable characters. At the beginning you choose a group to start with and they’re the ones you need to try to keep alive for the game. Each character has their own habits and skills. Marin, for example is a handyman, so he is able to craft items with fewer materials. A very useful skill. Katia is good at bargaining, so she’s the best character to use for trading. Some characters can carry a lot of items or are very stealthy, making them good scavengers. The characters’ mental states are something that need to be managed throughout the game as well. Some characters are smokers, who can be relaxed by a cigarette. Some are sensitive – they become depressed very quickly if you need to steal from or kill other civilians, while others have an “it’s us or them” attitude. Make too many decisions that negatively impact a character’s mental state and they can become broken, effectively removing them from gameplay  11 Bit Studios have taken both war games and resource management to a new place were the challenge doesn’t come only from the mechanics, but also from the kinds of decisions you need to make. Will you steal from your elderly neighbors who have plentiful supplies and won’t defend themselves? Or will you risk venturing out further to avoid stealing from good people to get what you need? If you steal from your neighbors you will be responsible for shortening their lives. If you go to a more risky area then you could be hurt or killed yourself.  This War of Mine is a very challenging game, especially at the beginning. During my first couple tries, I quickly got my characters killed. After a bit I was able to get the hang of it and successfully completed a game. I was able to finish the game without fighting or killing anyone, and I appreciated that this was a possibility. I did steal, I did get shot at a few times, but I was always able to run away. The game does throw curveballs at you. As you get to a “comfortable” state where you have enough supplies, suddenly the weather will change and you’ll need much more fuel to keep warm. Or your go-to places for scavenging will dry up or become unreachable due to enemy attacks.  The game does have a few mechanical annoyances. It’s really easy to have the wrong character selected when you give a command. It’s not a huge deal to correct, but it happens so often. Combat is also quite awkward. Now, I think this is somewhat intentional. Given the setting combat should not be fun or easy, however I think it could be a bit more smooth. I also found the game lasted too long. In my first play, the war ended after 45 days. My second game lasted 25 days which I found a much better length. Again, given the setting, there’s merit to design choices which make the player uncomfortable, but there needs to be a balance between message and mechanics.  There is a decent amount of replay value in the game. There’s a lot of randomness, whether it be the house and supplies you start with, the locations you have access to, or the season the game starts in. Playing with different groups of characters can also change the experience. It also has the “just one more turn” addictiveness of something like Civ or XCOM.  Verdict – Highly recommended. This War of Mine is an achievement which combines a fresh take on war with challenging resource management and compelling gameplay. It forces you to make hard choices and has real emotional impact. While there are some mechanical annoyances, I highly recommend the experience.",

            "review_text": "This game is okay.   Not a whole lot to do other than try to survive. During the day you work on your homebase. Build a workbench so you can build tools and weapons. Upgrade that workbench so you can build a gun and upgrade it some more so you can create bullets. You can find ingredients and resources at night when you go snooping around like a racoon, or a good ol fashioned cat-burglar.   During the day you can sleep and build and every other day a trader will stop by your pad and you can trade for food with all the crap you collect at night. Eventually you can start making your own booze and medicines, which can also be used to trade for food. Food is top priority. You can't drink water, you need food.  Night time ain't so bad. Some of the locations of interest have bad guys. Some are just regular people trying to survive like you. If you steal from or kill anyone who's not a bad guy, your character will get sad, and if you continue down that path your character will become, 'broken.' When that happens they sit around all day, not moving, and there's no saving them from it. You will be forced to end the day and sleep in bed at night, leaving you open to other cat-burglars that kill you in your paralyzed state. If you didn't die or become mortally wounded or deathly sick, then eventually you snap out of it and are able to venture out at night with instinct as your guide. Also, killling bad guys is a good thing. Sometimes they will say something like, 'that priest sure went down easy,' or, 'let's hit another humanitarian aid again,' and this is your cue to kill them. When you get back home, no one will care that you killed a bad guy. No one will congratulate you either, though. Try not to kill or steal from innocents. But if you must steal, don't get caught or they will kill you.   Fighting is random chance. Roll the dice. Sometimes you can sneak up from behind and club them in the head, then shoot em up real good, other times, your character loses the dice roll and you pay with your life. Your best bet is hide and one-hit-kill them with a knife.   So for the most part, do this until the war ends. Or whenever the days counter is up. I lasted 40 days once and the war didn't end. I lasted 25 days in another game and won. War ended.   Eventually you learn what you need to create booze, to create meds, to trade for food.   There's no saving your game, so don't worry about that. It saves every start of day. And if you do a bunch of stuff during the day, like upragde a workshop and board up a window, and feed everyone and trade for good stuff and have everyone sleep and not be tired for night - then night comes and instead of playing anymore you quit game - it will not save. In fact, when you reload your last save, it will be before you upgraded anything, before you fed everyone and before you traded. Quite annoying to say the least.  The game is like a 5-6/10. I honestly only bought it because it was on sale for eight bucks.",

The two tried to make it through, but the loss of their friend hit them  hard .  But then, another survivor came along, wanting to join the group, which the two welcomed. Yet her presence did not strengthen their resolve, as they slowly got even more depressed by the day, especially when their rations were running out.  One night, as one of the original survivor tried to scavenge for food, he ended up coming across a group of bandits, and was shot down as he tried to run away.  Even with that, the last two (again) tried their hardest to get more food, even by trading all they could in the park. But their shelter were constantly ransacked, eventually crippling their supplies, the both of them both heavily wounded.  The woman woke up to find out the last of the original survivor had left during the night, leaving her alone. That man didn't even survive, as word came around that he was also shot as he looked for his brother.   Sadly, not having the energy to do anything, she spent her last few days on her own death bed.  One of the most depressing games I've ever played in quite a while. (almost as much as MGS 4.)  Great game. Expectations: 7/10 from the concept alone.

Felt so bad for letting him die, and the others became sad :(  This game is amazing and special cause in most War games you play as a Solider, in this one you play a group of Civilians who are desperately trying to survive in a city which is the center of a war zone.

Up to that point, my guerrilla buddy Roman was kicking serious ♥♥♥, even surviving a nearly fatal wound and being on bed rest for two weeks. That bed rest almost bankrupted my group, because nobody could risk going out to scavenge while people were trying to attack us so frequently, and we were down a person. Then, a rather unfortunate scuffle at a military outpost happened immediately after Roman made a full recovery.  My almost as awesome sneaky lady Arica took his place in scavenging, and slaughtered the soldiers who gunned him down with an axe to the back. After nearly losing all my survivors in the middle of winter while trying to nurse Roman back to health, I suddenly had a crazy surplus of supplies.  Day 41: Arica is finishing up looting the military outpost and goes back to the house.  Day 42: Arica comes back to the house. Bruno and Cveta have frozen to death, out of ♥♥♥♥ing NOWHERE. EVERYONE had been walking around on guard that night with rifles, but I guess they couldn't be bothered to just throw some fuel into the furnace to keep warm. Two survivors left, I say ♥♥♥♥ it and end the day, and stay in so just the two of them can survive.  Day 43: War's over.  10/10 would rage at silly mechanics again.  So, This War of Mine is a very, very good resource management/survival game. It is also tense, unbelievably tense, and lots of fun to play. It can get repetitive at times, but unless you have a very well-established base and are mostly self sufficient, you are playing a constant game of keeping up with resource needs. It took me roughly 3/4 of the way into my playthrough to really be well-off. The things you find yourself doing to stay alive can range from understandable to downright horrific, but the game doesn't force you into doing something awful and then dangle it in your face (*cough*, Spec Ops: The Line, *cough*). You are entirely in control of what you do to stay alive. I found myself targeting only bandit and soldier encampments, the latter of which I actually felt kinda bad about. I only got into the military outpost I spoke about above by slaughtering the soldiers who were willing to trade with me. The bandits can go ♥♥♥♥ themselves though.  That being said, the game is not without its flaws. They are mostly very minor, though. For example, the silly mechanic that you completely lose all control of your survivors at home when you go out scavenging, and if you haven't forced them to do something before night time comes, they won't be able to do it until the morning. Is a person starving but you just managed to get something cooked at 7:50 and now they don't have enough time to get to the stove to eat it? Too bad, they will stay up all night and not touch the food, which would only take them 5 minutes to eat. And speaking of the stove, winter can be obnoxious in this game if you only have one stove. When winter comes, you have to boil readily available snow on your stove with a filter to get clean water, but if you have cooked a meal on the stove, the stove interaction is replaced with eating the meal, and you can no longer use the stove to create fuel (it's the only item in the game that I know of that could create fuel from other items, not counting the hatchet to break furniture down) until you eat the rest of the food. Did you make extra food and now nobody is hungry? Too bad, nobody will be able to use it to make fuel now, and people will probably freeze to death without it. And speaking of freezing like my two group members did, that is probably the one thing that infuriates me about this game; if you have resources available for someone to prevent death or expedite healing or what have you, they just will not give a ♥♥♥♥ and they will not use them at night. When my two group members froze to death, we were sitting on a very healthy supply of fuel, but I guess they were just so watchful for bandits that they couldn't throw a couple ♥♥♥♥ing logs in the furnace. Best part? No bandits showed up that night.  All in all, the game is very enjoyable, despite its flaws. I do very much so recommend this game, especially considering it's on sale as of me writing this.  Overall score: 8.5/10  Pros:  *Very good story and atmosphere *Tense, emotionally charged gameplay *Very unique in many ways *Randomly generated experience each time  Cons: *Not being able to control your whole group at night *Your group not having any self-preservation when they could prevent their deaths *Minor issues with mechanics of certain pieces of furniture, particularly the oven  Great game, good developer. Buy the DLC to support charity too!",

This War of Mine is a magnifecent, if not groundbreaking, new style to the genre. I really can't put into words how to describe it other than a visceral escape into a war-ravaged city. Everything you do has consequences, and you won't be prepared for anything. Not only do I find myself feeling emotions about the actual game, I find myself contemplating about the entire aspect of life for those trapped in cities such as the one in This War of Mine. Kudo's to the dev's, especially for the fact there's donations to people surviving in war zones.  If I could offer any feedback, it would be that I would very much like to see this game in the futre become a 1st person survival game, something along the lines of the fallout series. The turn-based 'Night' &amp; 'Day' atmosphere kind of left me hungry to explore more and delve deeper into the atmosphere. Although, I'm pretty sure this all adds to the actual dark, gritty, uncertain forboding fog of war it gives players a taste of, the concept is remarkable and original.  I'm so glad I played this. Being a Marine Corps veteran myself and having met many people in Afghanistan displaced by war - it often leaves me sad for many reasons, and it certainly hit home.

I am more than satisfied of the fluent (all most realistic) ways the characters are doing chores or any activity to be honest, from fighting to looting and idle stances.  3. The game is difficult and it can be really frustrating at times. Losing a survivor because some small stupid decision or not enough caution; living with the uncertainty that the place you choose to loot or to trade won’t give you the necessary items to deal with a certain crisis back in your shelter; or never having enough food, meds or parts to do the necessary upgrades; these are things that made me restart the game all over again several times, but nonetheless it kept me going for hours until I found an optimum way to manage resources and visit the appropriate places for loot.  4. I love the combat system. You can go guns blazing but the most efficient way is stealth and tactics. You need to lure the enemy by making noise or simply just sneak at their backs and knock them down.   Overall it’s an amazing game.

I would suggest you get it if you're interested in learning about survival and food/time management, but it's not for everyone. If you try to take others out, you have to choose which ones who are actually hurting the other innocents or your people will be depressed. Also, you cannot just go guns blazing (limited bullets). You have to go really stealthy or have a lot of cover because it's not going to work out with just a knife or pistol with one bullet. No heatshots, Call of Duty Fans.

Will you steal from the elderly couple down the road and ultimately condemn them to death just to feed yourself?

This game should be part of the National Curriculum.  Just get it.",

            "review_text": "By far one of the biggest surprises of this year. I have bought plenty of games this year but This War of Mine just shines so bright through pile of ♥♥♥♥ that i had to put up with from recent releases. This War of Mine places you in the aftermath of a warzone that is still being ravaged by the army and the rebels. You control 3 characters which consists of a cook, a scavanger and a barter though it might be different for others since its randomly generated.   Since the city is being plagued by snipers during the day, your characters take shelter in an empty crippled building which can be upgraded by finding the right amount of materials. You can craft items such as stove to cook raw food for your survivors as they must eat in order to keep going. You can also craft workshop to build picklocks and other tools. Theres a wide varity of items and upgrades but all of that comes with the price of finding the items. That's where the fun begins with the game. At night you will be able to send one of your survivors on a scavange hunt for supplies. You must decide who goes and who stays. There will be multiple locations to go to, each with a description giving you info about what kind of supplies it has and whether it is safe or not. Then you have to decide whether you wanna hunt for materials or food or a little bit of both. Depending on your situation, you will have to choose what you want since your characters can carry only so much. Theres a time limit during the day and during the night so you must do what you can with the amount of time you are given.  But that's not the end of it. On your journey, you will come across different npc's, some harmless and some ruthless. You will come across folks just trying to survive. But what if you are barely surviving and they got stuff that you need and you dont have anything to trade? You could steal from them sure but what if you arent able to? Are you willing to kill a guy who is trying to find medicine for his father just for his supplies? or would you try your luck somehwere else where bandits are just waiting for you to make the wrong move? and that's the beauty i found in this game, it made me do bad things because there was no other way my team would survive if i hadnt kill those folks who would not lend me their stuff and i couldnt take my chance taking on bandits who were so close to each other to pick em off one by one. At the begging of the game, i had no idea the game would throw me such a moral choice. I thought it would be easy to survive, that i wouldnt kill innocent people, i wanted to be the good guy but instead i just wanted my team to survive no matter what. Kill or be killed, and thats how my first playthrough consisted of.   That being said, the gameplay can be repetitive for some folks. I can totally understand but when you play it you get so immersed in this ♥♥♥♥ed up situation that you dont realize you have been playing for several hours.",

            "review_text": "This is one the the greatest single player survival games I've ever played.   The story: There's a war, ♥♥♥♥'s ♥♥♥♥ed, you need to survive.   The gameplay: Smooth and strategic as you try to use your survivor's advantages to your own use while trying to not only improve living conditions, but survive as well. Scavenging is probably one of the most exciting (and infuriating) things you will ever do in gamin, not to mention you'll feel like an ♥♥♥ afterwards. Combat is strange but exciting and nerve wrenching, when you lose a character or anything ♥♥♥♥ happens, hell even if your characters have a stubbed toe they communicate and complain, which suprisingly is more human than annoying. There is also sight during scavenging to make it useful to have wits about yourself. Also you can loot and decorate your house to fit the needs of your survivors as well.  Graphics: It's sorta weird, but in a intresting and educated way, the UI is very new guy friendly along with being great for new players. the pictures and art is surreal and beautiful (in a dark and greiving way) to where you feel like you are controlling living breathin people. Not to mention all animation is top notch.  Sound: Great fitting soundtrack with a bandwagon full of sounds and ambience. The characters tend not to speak but have text boxes, which i think suits the game really.   Overall this is the best survival game i've played and i'm impressed, keep updating and great work guys!

Before i bought it i watched a few minutes on a 'let´s play' on youtube by which the game was presented as a 'survival game without zombies'. Laughed about this comment as it really says alot about the current gaming industry. There is tons and tons and tons of 'procedurally generated open world sandbox zombie holocaust survival games ' blah, blah, blah. The industry seems to be all out of ideas. This War of Mine is different. Mainly, the setting of the game is more plaussible than other survival games. It emulates events that actually happens when civilians suffers from war. In game where you kill heaps of zombies with a shovel, you as a player really don´t feel affected by it: It´s a faceless monster going after your brains, it´s not a person or even an animal. But when you play a regular person that kills an old man in sheer desperation for food, now that´s something that really gets to you. It´s this that makes This War of Mine great. You are constantly faced with really though ethical decisions. You only have food for two and there is four of you. Who should eat? The hungry, sick old man or the starving young woman? Should we give medicne to that sick old man and hopefully save his life or should we save it to possibly barter for food for everyone? Where should we go to find supplies? Should we send someone to the hotel eventhough we know it´s very dangerous? Or should we go to a safer location but possibly end up with nothing and starve? How far are we prepared to go for food? Would we steal from the helpless? Would we murder for it? And the desperation rises...  Overall i think this is a great game. Restarted it a few times and it´s always slightly different. Only few cons i can think of is that eventhough it´s slightly different every restart, the replay value isn´t so high that you feel that you would have as fun with it as the first time you finished it. Yet there´s always some 'what if´s' left when you finish the game. The character biographies isn´t all that developed and sometimes you lose track of their personal stories. Their stories are mainly about things from the past and doesn´t relate so much to their current situation. If the relations between the characters where more developed, with dialoges and events based on their internal relations, this game would be something you would play over and over and over... This plus some minor tweaks and it would be a total 10 out of 10.  And if they launched a sequel i would be all over it!",

            "review_text": "'This War of Mine' is a deeply captivating War-Survival game. In 'This War of Mine', you're not a trained super-soldier mowing down hordes of brown people. Here, you're in the middle of a civil war as one of the many innocent civilians who are now trapped within the besieged city 'Pogoren'.  The Military and the Rebel faction called the 'Vysenti' are fighting eachother over the city. This means that supplies are scarce, travel during the day will lead to a certain death, either by the constant shelling or the bloodthirsty snipers that hide in the tall buildings of Pogoren. At night, the people must scavenge or pillage for supplies. The setting is extremely depressing. Bombed buildings, injured and sick innocent civilians, hungry children and people in need. It's the setting that makes 'This War of Mine' stand out amongst the other survival games. You will find yourself compelled to survive, to keep your survivors alive.  The survivors you will lead through the civil war have their own skills and disablities. You will get different survivors each time you start a new game. The skills and disablities are simple, yet they work extremely well. An example: Bruno used to be TV-chef before the war broke out. Bruno can cook food for less materials. But, Bruno is also a Smoker. This means that you have to make sure you have an ample supply of cigarettes for Bruno so he can feed his addiction. If you don't, he can get sad and even have a harder time overcoming grief.  Gameplay is relatively simple. Combat is an extremely dangerous task, as you are simple civilians who are not trained in combat. This means that the combat is deliberately simple. With guns you just hover your mouse over the one you wish to harm, and click. Same goes for melee, except you have to be closer, ofcourse. During the day, you will have time to eat, dress wounds, consume medicine, build upgrades for your shelter such as a workshop where you can make tools and much more...  Ultimately, 'This War of Mine' moved me in a way no other game has. It displayed a side of war that is sadly overshadowed by the Hollywood-style shooters such as 'Call of Duty' and 'Battlefield'. Rather than 'Press F to feel!' you are affected by what YOU have done. Killed another survivor for their stuff? Your survivors will become sad, maybe even depressed, and committing more in-humane actions, may break your survivors mentally which can push them to suicide if they are not cheered up. The actions of one survivor can affect your entire group. Some survivors are affected more negatively to certain actions than others, while others are affected less from negative actions. All survivors are unique.   Gameplay: 8/10 - It's very simple. Combat especially. Yet, it still works perfectly by not making it the main emphasis of the game. Story: 9/10 - You, essentially, write your own story by your actions. Not by picking from a choice of 3 dialogue options, but by what you decide to do. Art/Graphics - 10/10. Once again, it fits the enviroment you are in. Shadows have a beautiful pencil-effect to them, boosting the dark and gruesome feel the game gives out. Music: 10/10 - It fits the gameplay flawlessly. Well composed acoustic guitar-tracks and other kinds of tracks multiplies the feelings you will experience.  'This War of Mine' gets a 9.5/10 from me - Not a game for everyone, certainly. But if you enjoy a compelling game that tells a dark story that doesn't have to be fun to be enjoyable, 'This War of Mine' is for you.",

            "review_text": "This game, as several reviews state, is unlike any other.   It's a dark, horrible environment that you play in, with tough decisions to be made. Some will save your group but make them depressed, others will use precious resources but cheer your group up, and some may get you killed.  I will state now that I haven't made it past day 14, I usually get to that stage (with various group lineups) and decide to take a chance at a 'dangerous' scavenge and always find myself dead fairly quick. I know I should delay the 'dangerouss until I have better gear and resources but I always start to panic at 2 weeks heh.  What it does show me is that this isn't a game you can rush. Everything is slow and careful, some nights (later in the game) with no scavenging but scouting instead (if you have the right group set up). You need to plan in advance your resources, both food and workshop.  The graphics are very atmospheric, adding to the darkness and grittiness of the game. It's black, white and grey, No other colours, so don't expect a pretty game.  You start off with a few set group choices, and often in the game other characters will appear asking to join you. There are plenty of guides on Steam that explain each characters pros and cons, and I really recommend reading them. Some you will want to be cruel and turn away.  And that leads to, in my mind, the one bad thing about the game. The characters and their skills. Some skills are still unknown, others aren't obvious, some are just generally useless. All of which leads to a set 4-5 chars you want in your group. Every guide states the same. I've tried it my own way and found that yup, the longest I've lasted is with at least 2 of those 4-5. It's the same chars over and over again, which gets dull and boring. It would be nice to mix it up, perhaps chars with 2 main skills each, allowing cross-over and use of the other 'useless' chars in the game.   Please note, by useless I mean long-term use. Each has a skill which could be useful if the game was easier and you could support 6-8 chars easily. You can't. The most you can generally support AND survive the 40 days is 4 chars. So you have to be brutal and choose only the most useful out of all 12 chars. It just so happens it's the same 4-5 chars every time :-(  However, if you ignore that one con, the rest of the game is amazing and addictive. Hours pass by without you realising it, as you concentrate on your group so much, and what you need next, then it's just one more scavenge so I can make item xxx then I'll log out, but you make xxx then realise you need to make item yyy so it's just another quick scavenge...  When you get to approx day 10-11, it opens up new group set-ups on the main menu.  This War of Mine is one of the few games that I actually read the 'bunff', in this case the character's and their stories. I read each and look forward to learning more about them. Each story seems dark (as with everything in the game) and sad, and gives a terrible perspective about what it is really like to survive in such a situation. I have yet to finish them, but there are guides on Steam that tell every character's story. Personally, I want to wait until I've earnt it.  However, I do recommend reading some of the guides on how to survive. Don't just read one, but several, as each gives different advice, some work for some people and some for others. After trying and testing, I've found I do bits from all of them. I did try doing it without reading the guides to start with and never made it past day 5. After reading the guides, I found out where I was going wrong and it made a huge difference.  So to end. This game is definately worth the money. It seems to be well supported by its developer. It's a dark, gritty and brutal game, and that works.",

Choices like this are everywhere. You also don't know who's friendly and who isn't. There were cases I was suprised i was not shot on sight. I've gotten very lucky by being allowed to leave, but the flip side is there are Npcs who will shoot you to take your one can of food.

            "review_text": "Overall this is a very good game for the artistic representation of the oppression of war, however, as a game it has flaws as well.  Pros:  + The atmosphere is very good. + The personalization of the story to a few people who vary different plays is well-designed. + The 'feel' of the game is very sad and effective for the topic - and I really like the art. + All of this adds up to a strong experience.  Not plusses:  - Like any game of the type, it has to invent some ways making it a 'game', and those aren't always enjoyable - do you have enough food, heat, morale, etc.  - That gaming side tends to take you out of the game a bit learning ways to 'game the system' - how best to do what the game wants more than relating to the situation depicted.  But that last point isn't as bad as it sounds. The game does well mostly at those gameplay elements, despicting issues and other people in the game, and providing options for different playstyles.  It's not a game I really feel warm and fuzzy about returning to, and I don't really look forward to parts like the combat side. But I think it's a great experience worth trying.",

The way it keeps you anticipated and makes you a nervous wreck is saying something. With other survivors around you and you possibly having to steal or kill them just to get along is alot. You may be thinking I don't care anout other survivors... Thats what I thought but you know, they don't all get angry and pull out machine guns and spray you down. For example I may or may not have battered a woman for no reason other than the fact that my man for some reason randomly ran into the house and got her attention. But she did try to fight me off and when realised she was losing ran to her companion upstairs, (most likely her bf due to she was female and he male) he then came down with her and for a walked around the house together. Then he told her to wait inside and he just went to check outside, I took my chance to finish her off and it made me feel kind off like laughing (hope I'm not a physco) but also sad because before she died she whispered 'please no.' This made it obvious she was just a survivor as she said this in our first encounter, when I broke into the house, so I kind of felt like I was robbing relatives almost or a friend I knew, but in this war ridden town you have to do what you have to do, right?   Obviously since I can say so much about one encounter I've had shows it's a emotional game, that does not meen it's some love fantasy game or any of that crap. It's a serious game with a depressing edge to it. I find the best comparison is real life, you always have happy moments in wars but it's also a very unhappy place and most likely dangerous if you're in the centre of it. It's like stalingrad, destroyed and not much supplies to go around (In WWII obviously.) I feel like I bought this game 5 mins ago and I'm looking at how long I've played it for: 4.2 hrs last two weeks / 4.2 hrs on record. I only just bought this game and I've fell in love with it. If you like the sound of this game please check it out on youtube or other reviews don't just take my word for it. But please give this game a chance because it obviously hasn't got the same publicity as other games but I feel it really, really deserves it. Great game.

            "review_text": "I played this game before and I'm still playing but I play in offline mod generally so do not consider my hours on record. Basically this is fantastic game. Seriously you have to think about so many things and you have to figure out how you can make everything good until the end of war while considering ethical and moral things.   For example, once I just killed every people to get their foods and medicines. However then all the players started becoming depressed and that was really hard to control or I tried to play 'nice man' but then I died because I gave all the important things to someone else when they asked. Those children want really much !! Or in the Quite House I did not want to kill those older couple but after 10-15 days when we out of everything I had to kill them.   Basic tips: - Without Marko surviving is really difficult because when you go to scavenge, you have to come back as much as possible. - If you are making your story, for the supermarket choose the soldier section because easily you can have a rifle and also because you save that woman everyone will feel nice. - When you start the game make a metal workshop and then a shovel. - After that make at least one bed immediately and be sure in a while you need to have beds for every person. - Upgrade your metal workshop, oven and workshop as soon as possible.  - Do not give food everyday. I think best way is food per 2 days.  To make this game better: - When someone comes to you and says 'we need this could you give me.' Sometimes you do not have what needed and you have to say no. There should be an option like 'I'm sorry we do not have what you want.' You can use it both way. I mean in truth manner or lie manner. Sometimes even you have you can say ohh sorry we do not have and it makes the players depressed. - Definitely we have to be able to double scavenge because even you have Marko, 15 slots is not enough.

            "review_text": "As most other reviews will tell you, This War of Mine (TWOM) offers a gaming experience from a perspective rarely seen in urban warfare environments - that of the civilians. This game charts the progress of a group of mismatched individuals who find themselves trapped within a wartorn city that is under siege by the military trying to wrest control of it back from rebel forces. There is no infrastructure, no power or running water. The city is crumbling, withering on the vine, and the group you control are right in the middle of the rotting heart.  Your survivors begin the game in a relatively large abode they have chosen as their base camp. To call it a home or even a house is laughable - the walls are falling down, there is debris everywhere and the fridge is empty. The primary method of control is point and click - you click on one of your civilians to select them, then click on the action you wish them to take. Actions are context-sensitive - if there is a locked door and you have a lockpick, an appropriate icon can be found next to the door. If there is salvageable debris on the floor, clicking on the hand icon above will direct your civilian to search it. The simplicity of this system helps negate the confusion that can arise from playing the game for the first time and being suddenly presented with dozens of different icons around the abode.  Your survivors spend their days inside their abode, as it is too dangerous to venture outside due to snipers. This is the resource management/crafting section of the game. During this time you can build additional facilities such as stoves, workbenches and rain collectors (assuming you have the resources to build them), you can let your civilians rest/eat, and possibly barter with a passing trader. There are a comprehensive number of different structures that can be built around the place, and many of them can then be upgraded further to either access new items, or make it easier to create existing ones. It is also the part of the game where you will maintain your group's wellbeing, including feeding them, tending to their wounds, and sending them to bed to help them get over their misery.  When night draws in, choices must be made. At this point in the game you can send a single soul out to different locations around the city to scavenge for goodies, be they food, medical supplies, weapons or something else desperately needed by your camp. Once a location is selected, the game becomes a point and click stealth sim, akin to Mark of the Ninja or Deadlight. You have a cone of vision, and other NPCs in the location, if you can't see them, may make themselves known to you by their sound, which will appear as a pulsating red circle.  Night scavenging is a diabolically tense affair. When approaching the door to an unknown property, you will have a vague idea what to expect based on the brief synopsis of the area the game gives beforehand. You look through the keyhole and, seeing nothing of note, you open the door and stalk your way into the lounge. Searching a cupboard you find a few blocks of wood and some vegetables. Suddenly, you see it (or rather, hear it). A pulsing red circle, on the ceiling above you. Someone (or something) is here in the house with you. Do they live here? Are they friendly?  Are they alone?  And so the decisions of TWOM assault you, not through binary text choices or sterile morality wheels, but through pure choice.  Do you leave immediately, unwilling to incur the wrath of the inhabitant but knowing you will return empty handed? Do you try to sneak around the ground floor, searching for what little you can, knowing there may be more upstairs? Do you charge upstairs before whatever it is can prepare itself, and ready your crowbar for a fight? Do you draw your pistol, carefully counting the three bullets you have left?  TWOM is not a game you win. It is a game where you try to stay alive as long as you can, doing whatever is necessary to survive. And as the days drag by and the food supplies dwindle and the cold laps at your fingers and Pavle starts getting sicker and the looters get bolder, you will be called upon to answer the question - are you willing to diminish?  Are you willing to steal medicine from a desperate hospital, or let Pavle die from infection? Are you willing to rob a man and his sick father at gunpoint for the food you traded them two days ago, or let Katia starve for another day? Are you willing to murder a vicar in case he has something you can use?  The presentation of TWOM is well considered, using a pencil-sketch art style with 2.5D environments. The game brilliantly conveys a sense of devastation and disrepair within the locales you investigate with little effort. The macabre atmosphere is enhanced by a haunting, albeit not very varied soundtrack containing reverb-drenched guitars, sombre strings and oscillating, industrial percussion. The gameplay, despite using essentially the same mechanics throughout. manages to achieve two very different, almost schizophrenic styles in the contrast between night and day. Days are quiet, slow, reflective encounters, while nights out scavenging are stressful, deadly and panic driven.  The game is not perfect. Combat can be clunky and confusing affair, although this is possibly part of the game intent, demonstrating that violence should be an absolute last resort. However, this does not prevent the immense frustration that I felt when (for the second time) I sneaked up on an armed guard with my shotgun, only to get TOO close at which point my civilian decided that rather than fire a round of buckshot through the guard's back, he would instead try to melee him to death with the butt of the gun. Needless to say, my game ended there. The roguelike element of TWOM means that you will never become 'good' at combat, although that's probably the point. As mentioned before, the music could do with a few more tracks, and does get repetitive (though this does help contribute to the relentless, monochrome tone of the game overall).  I recommend TWOM on the basis that it has the potential to invoke the same ambivalence of mind that can come from, say, the decisions you make in the Walking Dead series, or Dragon Age, but through gameplay rather than specific story choices.  One last thing to mention. After you have started your first game, two options appear on the title screen - Continue, and Another Try. Not 'New Game'. Another Try.  And who knows? Maybe this time you won't die like a dog for no good reason.  War is Hell.",

            "review_text": "'The War is Over.' That's the phrase that pops up when you survive the war, and frankly after playing this game that's all the satisfaction you will ever need.   This game is indie. It's not funny, it's not known for its fighting mechanics, but it sends a message that can be summed up in three words 'war is bad.' But of course we already know that right? 9 out of 10 people you ask will probably say that war is bad. They might say support our troops, let the conflict in the middle east end, or hold a moment of silence as a sign of respect. But talk is cheap, actions are what define a person.   By actions are what define a person I am not suggesting a call to action that every single one of us quit our dayjobs or schooling to go rally and achieve world peace. What I am asking is that you experience a very accurate simulation of what war is truly like, because after this game trust me, you will have a whole new understanding of what war is. Playing this game won't suddenly make you relate to the horrors that the REAL victims of war have seen. But it will make you feel like a human being and if you do it right, you will get some strong emotions in the mix too.  If you do get this game, I suggest you try to play it as realistically as possible and as humanly as possible. What I mean by that is that you keep in your mind that these are real people you are controlling, because eventually there will come a point in the game where you will simply forget that. Everytime your character helps someone, you will feel happy. Everytime you turn away a neighbor asking for help you will feel bad. You will see things in the game that you are powerless to stop. Your morals will be questioned all the way until you either survive or perish. Will you steal from an elderly couple? Will you stand up from those who are being abused even if it means putting yourself in danger? Will you barter with the very people who are responsible for ♥♥♥♥♥♥, looting, and taking advantage of ordinary citizens like you? You won't know who you really are until you play this game, until you realize that the game is sad for a reason, until you realize that all of the things that happen in this game could and have happened to other people in real life.  You know war is bad. Now experience it for yourself.  TL:DR I was feeling inspired and emotional. War is bad. Get this game if you have a heart and want to learn at the same time that you have some fun. :)",

            "review_text": "It took me 3 tries and 18 hours to reach the end of the war with the easiest settings. Once I got the hang of it I didn't find it to be too hard, although since I did have it on settings that were about as easy as it can get so I could learn the game that's really no surprise. It's a really great game, but I probably won't be playing much more. If you're considering buying it, keep in mind that it isn't a game that you'll be throwing countless hours into; you'll play it for a few, and it'll be fun for those few, but after that you'll of had your fill.  I really enjoyed the 18 hours that I've played so far, however I'm not sure how much more I will be playing. While having the honor of saying I beat it on the hardest difficulty would be nice, this game doesn't have a whole lot of replayability. If I did go for another playthrough, I don't think it would be near as enjoyable. I would be going to the same buildings as before, getting the same supplies as before, and making the same things as before, meanwhile dealing with the same problems such as lack of food, medical supplies, supplies in general, and obstacles in the way of gathering supplies. This game is very enjoyable once, but I really have no interest in going again.  Another problem I had besides there being little replay interest was that often I found myself just sitting there bored on many days while I waited for someone to finish sleeping, just to have them go and craft something that will take them 3 hours, meaning more sitting and waiting. I really wish there was some way to fast forward through this other than the end day button, which is really only useful when you have done everything that you wanted to do for that day.   Those are my biggest issues with the game. That being said, I still recommend this game. Other than those, the game is very enjoyable. There's a lot to think about when you play, and messing one thing up could completely screw you over. I'd say overall, the biggest part of this game is resource and moral management, so if you enjoy management games then chances are you would enjoy this one as well. You constantly have to make choices such as do you take more wood or more food? Do you make a better stove or a better heater? Do you give a homeless man some food in the hopes of getting something valuable or play it safe and trade with someone rather than risk not getting anything in return for the food you donated? Do you steal from an elderly couple and doom them to death along with make the characters depressed or do you risk a character's life by stealing from an armed group that's hoarding supplies? Every decision can make an impact, which is important to keep in mind.   Despite there not being a whole lot of replayability for me and times when you just have to sit and wait, overall there is a lot to the game and I recommend it to anyone who thinks they would enjoy it.",

My take away lessons for newbies: Don't get attached to your characters, take small steps when exploring new sites, don't get greedy, don't go on a 'revange missions' if you lose a member of your team, sneak in and out of each sites (snipers can be leathal), make sure you take care of them wounds and sickness ASAP, plan ahead for the winter: fortify your home base, build a vaggie garden and traps for food, make as much stuff as you can to trade later on (You will need it). Use the right character for the right action/mission.  The possibilities are endless, the replayability of the game is more than exellent. (Random maps, items, encounters, game lenght... AWESOME)  I love the dark, pencil-style graphic, 2 mode play system (day/night).. Oh and check out ALL the stations on the radio... Some cool tunes hidden in there!  Overall I give this title a 10/10 for story/concept, 9/10 for interface/gameplay (had issues with the combat system)  Personal notes: Combat/defence interface could be improved and the fact that I was still getting raided over and over even after i upgraded the reinforced security door and patched all the holes was kind frustrating, specilally with 2 shotguns and a pistol in my inventory.

There wasn't a soldier and a woman, but a different woman in the entryway of the supermarket. She asked me, 'did you hear about what happened here? That poor woman... Someone could have saved her.'

            "review_text": "This game is amazing. It took me a few play throughs to really be hit by it but this last one shook me. Let me explain my story without spoiling anything.   The first several days were going well. The three of us, Arica, Roman, and Bruno, were scavenging supplies, defending, and resting while upgrading the base. We were lucky enough to have friendly neighbors that would bring over supplies. When tragedy struck them, we were more than happy to help.   After sometime, a lonely man, Marko, came to our home begging to join us. Since our home was well established, we welcomed him in. Right about the time our newest member was starting to fit it, tragedy struck and Marko was ripped from our lives. At the same time, supplies were getting harder to come by and we resulted to actions we never thought possible. While it shook us, we were still surviving.   Everything was going fairly well until winter came. The first couple of days were fine, but how were we to know the toll winter would have on us? We even relucantly welcomed, Cveta, to our band of survivors. Out of desperation, supplies were being gathered at whatever cost. This is how we lost Roman. We didn't even have time to mourn Roman when Arica failed to come back.  What was once a solid group of survivors was boiled down to two, Bruno and Cveta. Unfortunately, do to the weather, recent tragedies, and lack of supplies, Cveta became gravely ill. Our neighbors were also struck by tragedy but we were unable to offer them assistance this time. Desperately, we hung to the radio listening for when the winter would end and possibly even the war. Nothing useful was ever heard.   For days, the cycle continued. No news on the war or winter, Cveta crept closer to death, while Bruno tried desperately to find supplies that were only to be stolen the next night. We even traded away all of our valuables to limp on another day. What's the point of having a gun with no bullets? How long could we go on like this? How have we even survived the last few days in this death cycle?   Finally, finally, a reprieve; winter has ended. Bruno had found some medicine and was slowly nursing Cveta back from near death. We were going to make it! All that was needed was for this war to end. It has been so long, how can it possibly continue? Haven't enough died? What was gained? Still, the radio mocked us by providing no useful information.  This hit Bruno hardest of all, he became paralyzed by depression. To the point that Cveta, while still seriously ill, went out for supplies just to keep us going. What other choice did she have? We were still sick, wounded and slowly starving to death.   Cveta came home late, her injuries made the scavenging very challenging and lengthy. Overall, the haul was ok, but we still needed so much. Out of all the times I thought we wouldn't make it, this day was the start of a new hope that was squashed before it began. Bruno was gone. The brutality of this hell was too much for Bruno and he gave into the thoughts we tried desperately to suppress. Cveta was devastated. Not only had she risked everything so we could survive, but her sickness had worsened. Reluctantly, Cveta stayed home for the night and never woke up in the morning.",

This game is one of the best i have played and to be honest i only have found one minor bug that you can fix with getting out of your game and get back in. Or you ignore it and continue with a night and what until the next day. That is up to you. What is the bug? The buttons disapear. Its rare but it happened.  Now to the main game. This game is new to most apocalypse survival games. No Zombies. Only Humans. And it all depends on you how it ends. Similar to my 'Long live the queen' it is roguelike. You start with nothing and have to search for everything. The first item you get is a shovel but even that is a thing you have to craft. And after that everything is on you. You search through the different buildings, trade with a trader that comes to you sometimes. Sometimes people from other shelters ask for your help or even give you things.  One time when i played the game i went into a school building and read in the description that these people probably wont be as friendly as they look like. I went in with the thought of bandits and started to kill the first guy. After he was dead another came in and i murdered him directly. But then other people came and instead of attacking me they ran away and tried to look for help. In this case it wasnt them. It was me. I was the bandit that just brutaly murdered two innocent people. The game made me feel so bad about it that i didnt play for a little while.  It is your decision how this game ends. You can be stealthy or run in gunz blazin. But keep in mind that not everyone that carries a weapon or even a firearm is bad. Sometimes they just look for help or do not even want to hurt you and look for some stuff just as well as you do.",

Desperatly needs base attacks etc., combat is nice but it gets to easy once you realize how insane stealthkills are Needs more items and build-options, 'It's a desperate war: Hardly any resources, food or clean water... LETS BUILD A GODAMN DISTILLERY DJYEEAAAAAH'. Water is literally the most important commodity in war, with clean water paramount since dirreah/stomach sickness can be lethal when nutrition is scarce. Yet most water is spent on alcohol or godamn plants; Why do plants need filtered water?! Needs boobytraps etc.  Still, overall I am pleased and I'm usually a critical, cynical, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.",

All of those things combined get you to make decisions in this game that are painful to make.

I survived only one game so far (you win by surviving the war) while losing several people over the course of the other games.   I have only found/fixed/crafted a gun once in those games I have played. So they are kind of rare, but luck plays a role here, too. Food is expensive and meds are very expensive. Expect to trade nearly half your belongings for a couple bandages or pills. But that's probably how it would be in war. Necessities would be expensive.   It is depressing but addicting, Without spoilering it for you, play it. You wil get depressed and frustrated but that's the reason to play again. I would love to see Steam Workshop support for mods.

You play as a collection of civilians trapped in a city torn apart by war. This is the only game I've ever played that has you controlling civilians. Your goal is to lead these people to safety, by staying alive in a city full of bandits and cruelty. Everybody has a unique story to tell, but you can only hear it by keeping them alive. This is no easy task. This city is full of bandits and profiteers, who will not hesitate to kill and rob to save their own skins. But for every two villains, there is a hero. That person across the street might save your life by giving you food, out of the kindness of their hearts. The man who begged you to help save his friend might give you medicine or some valuable trading commodities. But are you willing to risk it? Will you risk your life by attacking a fully armed soldier carrying an assault rifle, just to save a stranger from a fate worse than death? Will you give food to the starving man, knowing full well that you will get nothing in return? Or will you take a different path? Are you desperate enough to rob an elderly couple just for a can of tuna? Will you steal from those kids on the verge of death, in order to get the medicine that you need? You will face these kinds of questions every day. You don't know when this war will end. You don't know if these people are good or bad. You just want to survive another day. But the question remains, how far will you go to survive?  The Good: +Great art style +Thought provoking and emotional choices +Gameplay centered on scavenging and stealth +Pulse pounding combat  The Bad: -Can be very difficult for some people -While combat is intense, it's still basic  Final Score: 9/10  I was VERY tempted to give a full 10/10, but the combat could use some improvement.

The graphics, sound design, crafting systems, combat mechanics are all optimized and are an extension of each other in every direction you could possibly connect the nodes. I haven't had the experience of playing so much on a single game time and time again since 2004's Half-Life 2 and Far Cry.  Naturally feeling the torn down environment and the grimy atmosphere, TwoM puts you in the skin of the civilians instead of the usual soldier and teaches you how to survive as well as displaying some of the harsh realities that are faced every day in war. I'm sure no close at all to know just how difficult it is, but This War Of Mine brought me as close to that feeling as possible and that's an experience I will never forget.  All your decision matter which is the ultimate climax of all its elements and is also the drive that keeps you going in the game for houres on end.  The developers earn the amazing review for their hard work and quite frankly I haven't seen an indie game as good as this one in 2014. Please buy the game and support them for future games, as that's all I want to see from them!  My score is a first and well-deserved 10/10 in the GamingReviews series and hopefully I'll be able to review even more, equally amazing games from 11 Bit Studios in the future.

I love how its not just another survival game with undead or something like that. Its just standard human vs human where even the NPC will kos. So from a Rust and Dayz player my heart wont erupt again like it usualy does in one of those games. The graphics with the stencil like drawing is extramly good, the point and click makes controls a little bit easier when it comes to sneaking around and learning yoru surroundings in a split second. But at times it messes you up and costs a survivors life. Also the infamous emotional feel in this game, yea it is well written enough to even make me feel sad for killing people. (and I was one of those former DayZ ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bandits who didint give a ♥♥♥♥ and just killed you) And finially the story its very not there, you actually gotta look for it and wait and see. Like sneaking up on a rebel band and listening to what they say instead of killing them like most would think to do. So overall 9/10 for me, it would be ten but the controlls at times ♥♥♥♥s you over big time.",

A confronting reality check showing you that a post apocalyptic setting is not about being the hero, it's about scraping by trying not to die and hoping for the best.  The gameplay: it's very strategic and reading a 'what to build first' post is nothing to be ashamed of. Combat is very difficult and risky (emphasizing that it should be avoided). You'll probably want to have a piece of paper on hand to write down the amount of resources you need before you go out scavenging to avoid missing that one part you need to upgrade your hideout.  The one thing that bugged me about the game was that you can only have one save at a time, not that I'd want to quicksave all the time, I just want to be able to have separate stories going at the same time without having to rename the save file in the game folders.",

This War of Mine is an amazing execution of the roguelike genre that uses that overused theme of War that most of our games now a days seem to have grown fond of using, however, they delve into things we generally do not think about, the civilian aspect of war. What happens to those who are not soldiers.   This game is one of the few games that have made me stop for a second and consider the moral implications of my actions. Do I starve to death, or do I kill to survive? That is a question that made me stop playing the first time I played this game.   It doesn't demonizes the enemy, hell, it humanizes it. They are other scavengers, survivors trying to hold out in the worst time of their live. It reminds us that war is more than just 'Terrorists and Counter-terrorists', it's those caught inbetween the fight, unable to escape.  It's one of the best thought, best designed games I've seen in a while, with a sound track that will get into you.  This is a game you simply MUST play at least once in your life.",

But it's not the kind of defeat that has you frustrated that makes you want to quit this game.  No.  It's the kind of frustration the festers when you know you made a mistake. I shouldn't have robbed those people, because my survivor is broken and now I can't go out and scavenge for food. I shouldn't have tried to take on those armed thugs because now someone has died. I should have boarded up my house sooner because I thought I could push my greed and make some animal traps and survive the night with just an axe.  That's the kind of frustration that we love. That lingering sense of victory behind the shroud of misfortune that this game keeps pulling you into.  You've read all the reviews before you, you know it's features. You know about the sense of immersion that game has, so how about replayability?  TWOM's replayability is limited ONLY by your imagination. That's right. Play the game after you have danced with your 25 raw food, your armory of 10 Assault Rifles and 8 Shotguns and make it harder for yourself. Challenge yourself: 'Can I beat this game without killing a SINGLE person?' Then you have something refreshing. Can you defeat winter... with no furnace? 'But that's impossible!' Shh-... It is possible, once you pick apart this game and find that it's real gem is you.  This game brings out all your colors. Your mechanical decision making-side that rushes animal traps so you can float raw food. The emotional shade that tugs on your heart when you kill Emil leaving the widow there to cry.

As an American I can feel safe when my country fights because the wars are thousands of miles from me. I'm glad that this game gave me a tiniest of glimpse of what it's like to be in those wars but not as a soldier.   While after my third or fourth play through I started seeing it more as a game there are still moments when I'm jolted out of the gamer mindset. Like when after running past several times I stopped and read the note in the hospital and found that almost all of the patients in the children's ward had died. It was a jaring moment and I felt a real wave of guilt that I hadn't brought any medicine for the doctors.  I treasure games that don't shine war in a light of pure glory, where the player character can triaumph over everything because that's not what war is.",

This War of Mine is an amazing execution of the roguelike genre that uses that overused theme of War that most of our games now a days seem to have grown fond of using, however, they delve into things we generally do not think about, the civilian aspect of war. What happens to those who are not soldiers.   This game is one of the few games that have made me stop for a second and consider the moral implications of my actions. Do I starve to death, or do I kill to survive? That is a question that made me stop playing the first time I played this game.   It doesn't demonizes the enemy, hell, it humanizes it. They are other scavengers, survivors trying to hold out in the worst time of their live. It reminds us that war is more than just 'Terrorists and Counter-terrorists', it's those caught inbetween the fight, unable to escape.  It's one of the best thought, best designed games I've seen in a while, with a sound track that will get into you.  This is a game you simply MUST play at least once in your life.",

            "review_text": "POSTED: 12 APRIL The War of 1812 was a military conflict that lasted from June 18, 1812 to February 18, 1815, fought by the United States of America against Great Britain, its North American colonies, and its North American Indian allies. Historians in the United States and Canada see it as a war in its own right, but Europeans sometimes see it as a minor theatre of the Napoleonic Wars, as it was caused by issues related to that war (especially the Continental System). By the war's end in early 1815 the key issues had been resolved and peace came with no boundary changes.  The United States declared war for several reasons, including trade restrictions brought about by the British war with France, the impressment of as many as 10,000 American merchant sailors into the Royal Navy,[5] British support for Native American tribes fighting American settlers on the frontier, outrage over insults to national honor during the Chesapeake–Leopard Affair, and possible American interest in annexing British territory.[6] The primary British war goal was to defend their North American colonies, although they also hoped to set up a neutral Indian buffer state in the Midwest.  The war was fought in three theatres. First, at sea, warships and privateers of each side attacked the other's merchant ships, while the British blockaded the Atlantic coast of the United States and mounted large raids in the later stages of the war. Second, land and naval battles were fought on the U.S.–Canadian frontier. Third, large-scale battles were fought in the Southern United States and Gulf Coast. At the end of the war, both sides signed and ratified the Treaty of Ghent and, in accordance with the treaty, returned occupied land, prisoners of war and captured ships (though neither side returned the other's warships due to frequent re-commissioning upon capture) to its pre-war owner and resumed friendly trade relations without restriction.  With the majority of its land and naval forces tied down in Europe fighting the Napoleonic Wars, the British used a predominantly defensive strategy in the Provinces of Upper and Lower Canada. Early victories over poorly-led U.S. armies, such as in the Battle of Queenston Heights, demonstrated that the conquest of the Canadas would prove more difficult than anticipated. Despite this, the U.S. was able to inflict serious defeats on Britain's Native American allies, ending the prospect of an Indian confederacy and an independent Native American state in the Midwest under British sponsorship. U.S. forces were also able to make several gains and score victories on the Canadian frontier; taking control of Lake Erie in 1813, seizing western parts of Upper Canada. However, a large-scale U.S. attempt to capture Montreal was repulsed in November 1813. Despite the major U.S. victory at Chippawa on July 5, 1814, serious U.S. attempts to fully conquer Upper Canada were ultimately abandoned following the bloody Battle of Lundy's Lane on July 25, 1814. The U.S. then fell back roughly 30 km (19 mi) from Lundy's Lane to Fort Erie, where they withstood a siege for several months. The British eventually withdrew, but as winter set in, the Americans demolished the fort and fell back across the Niagara.  In April 1814, with the defeat of Napoleon, the British adopted a more aggressive strategy, sending larger invasion armies and tightening their naval blockade. However, with the end of the Napoleonic Wars in Europe, both governments were eager for a return to normality and peace negotiations began in Ghent in August 1814. In the Deep South, General Andrew Jackson destroyed the military strength of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend. In September 1814, the British won the Battle of Hampden, allowing them to occupy eastern Maine, and the British victory at the Battle of Bladensburg in August 1814 allowed them to capture and burn Washington, D.C. They were repulsed, however, in an attempt to take Baltimore and Fort Bowyer, and during their assault at Fayal. An American victory in September 1814 at the Battle of Plattsburgh repulsed the British invasions of New York, which, along with pressure from merchants on the British government, prompted British diplomats to drop their demands at Ghent for an independent native buffer state and territorial claims that London previously sought. Given that it took six weeks for ships to cross the Atlantic, news of the peace treaty did not arrive before the British suffered a major defeat at New Orleans in January 1815.[7]  In the United States, late victories over invading British armies at the battles of Plattsburg, Baltimore (inspiring the United States national anthem, 'The Star-Spangled Banner') and New Orleans produced a sense of euphoria over a 'second war of independence' against Britain.[8][9] The war ended on a high note for Americans, winning the final engagements of the war and bringing an 'Era of Good Feelings' in which partisan animosity nearly vanished in the face of strengthened American nationalism. The war was also a major turning point in the development of the U.S. military. The poor performance of several U.S. militia units, particularly during the 1812–13 invasions of Canada and the 1814 defence of Washington, convinced the U.S. government of the need to move away from its Revolutionary-era reliance on militia and focus on creating a more professional regular force. Spain was involved in fighting in Florida but was not an official belligerent; some Spanish forces fought alongside the British during the Occupation of Pensacola. The U.S. took permanent ownership of Spain's Mobile District.  In Upper and Lower Canada, British and local Canadian militia victories over invading U.S. armies became iconic and promoted the development of a distinct Canadian identity, which included strong loyalty to Britain. Today, particularly in Ontario, memory of the war retains its significance, because the defeat of the invasions ensured that the Canadas would remain part of the British Empire, rather than be annexed by the United States. In Canada, numerous ceremonies took place in 2012 to commemorate the war, offer historical lessons and celebrate 200 years of peace across the border.[10] The conflict has not been commemorated on nearly the same level in the modern-day United States, though it is still taught as an important part of early American history,[11] and Dolley Madison's and Andrew Jackson's respective roles in the war are especially emphasized.[12][13] The war is scarcely remembered in Britain, being heavily overshadowed by the much larger Napoleonic Wars occurring in Europe.

My first 4 hours into the game should be learning how to play it, not learning how the mechanics of the game work (and, in the case of fighting, how they don't work.) I shouldn't feel like I have to have trial and error just to play, in other words. Because 4 hours of trail and error is pretty tedious.  I give this game a 7/10.

            "review_text": "Introduction: ========= This War of Mine definitely delivers!  A game where rather than playing as someone on either side of the war (the military or the rebels), you play as a simple group of survivors trying to survive. A fun, difficult at times, new experience on life during the war. Each character has a unique story, which fits well within the game, and if you survive long enough to make it to the end of the war, you get to find out what happens to each character... But is it positive?  Brief Review: ========== I have made two runs of the game, and made it through both.  Pros: ------- -Difficulty Increases; Survivor group dependent. -Originality; Each playthrough is slightly different. (Locations change, Scenarios change, Seasons change) -Melee Combat; Number generated, more likely to win if your character is well fed and content -Graphics; Simple, gritty, and beautiful -Resonably priced  Cons: ------- -Easy base raids; You will rarely lose a raid with guns for each of your survivors and 10+ ammo -Scavenge Combat; If your scavenger is fully equipped, you are pretty much unstoppable -Sneaking; Sometimes you will be found even though you're making no noise whatsoever.  Thoroughly enjoyed This War of Mine, there is so much potential to replay! Change character group, try different locations for scavenging, and survive many, many a war.  Rating: 8/10    In Depth Review: ============= After playing the game through a second time, I can safely say I have grown more in love with the game.  My first playthrough the war last a very long time. My base become fully secure, I had 5 survivors, and 10 days before the war ended, I had enough medicine, bandages, food, weapons, and armour that my survivors were well fed and content. We never lost raids, and no one could oppose me while scavenging.  My second playthrough the war was very short, lasting half the time of my first playthrough. However, this playthrough had me getting very angry every night. The war started in winter, for almost half of the war, everyone was sick and wounded, and there was very little I could do about it. I could never gather enough resources. The raids started very early, and got very aggressive even earlier, that is what frustrated me the most. Just as I was finally getting a nice stockpile of resources, they would disappear. However, the difficulty increase was refreshing and unexpected and made me strive to beat the game!  Both playthroughs had me in different bases, different seasons and some different starting locations. This was perfect, as it created originality in a sense. First I had to replan my base, as this one was completely new to me. The starting locations were different but familiar. However, even though they were familiar, they had changed ever so slightly. Instead of starting on the left side of a location, I started on the right side of some of them. Scenarios changed, I went to the supermarket and my first playthrough was the 'drunken military officer' scenario, the second was a 'band of thugs'. This through me off, as I only expected one scenario, so I set up for that particular scenario, however I had to retreat and be left with a very unproductive night of scavenging.  On my first play through I didn't really need the alcohol distiller, so I didn't bother seeing what it did and learning what I needed for it. However, on my second play through, making pure alcohol to make bandages and herbal meds, really was a must.  I will update this section with each playthrough, rewriting things that need rewriting and updating new things.",

It shows the probability of what would happen if a war broke out IRL, but if a war did break out in IRL, it'd probably be a nuclear war and everyone dies because that's how stupid people are. ANYWAYS.  TWoM is a very fun game, showing how 3 people band togeather and survive or die. Survive long enough, you will meet other survivors on the way, and get a bigger team. The bigger, the harder. Pavle, Katia, and Bruno survived...well, not very long. On day 1, Bruno was already sick, but we found enough supplies in our shelter to make a bed for Bruno to sleep on. We also made a radio, so we could hear what is going on, what ♥♥♥♥ is going down. It seemed to be the Rebels lost a valuable memmber. The weather would be warm, not very rainy for the next few days. I found a nice, good radio station that happened to play classical music, which was lovely with all the shelling and shooting in the background.  Night 1, Pavle went to go scavange, while Katia stood guard and Bruno slept to get better. Pavle found some usefull things, where he went. He found food, weapon parts, components, electronics, wood, etc. The building Pavle went to, well, it was vacant. No one lived there, so it was easy. The only thing that freaked Pavle out was the rats, which he thought were people walking around.  Day 2, the night seemed calm. Bruno seemed to get better, and Pavle got back with the resources. The three began to build a stove, in which they could cook better foods. They also made a metal workshop for better weapons. They did not have enough for any weapons, or enough for lockpicks. They did make a crowbar, and ventured further into the shelter, finding more items, making the workshop able to upgrade. They also made one more bed for Pavle to sleep, Bruno to stand guard, and Katia to go scavanging. Katia and Pavle went to go scavanging on different nights, finding foods, and resources, but no medication. This seemed to be going on for the next few days.  Day 3, not very exiting, some people to sell things.  Day 4, more news on the radio. More classical music.  Day 5, not very exiting.  Day 6, first robbery. We lost some food, even though we were very low on it.  Day 7, A man arrived to tell Katia about an aid drop. All the rebels took alot of it, but there were some in the no-mans land, the man said it was risky, but Katia went anyways, coming back with some food, water, and other resources, but she came back with some more wounds.  Day 8, not very exiting Night 8, Pavle went to Sniper Junction, where he found good loot and saved a man's baby.  Day 9, not very exiting, more robberies, no-one went scavanging due to sickness and injuries.  Day 10, not very exiting.  Day 11, a women showed up and asked to join, and she was very helpfull because she went scavenging the next few nights.  Day 12, More robberies, everyone was injured but the new girl due to scavanging.  Day 13, The New girl died while scavanging.  Day 14, Pavle died from hunger and his injuries, Katia died from severe injures, leaving Bruno with severe injuries, sickness, and his heart broken, fearing for his life.  Day 15...Bruno couldn't take it anymore, and commited suicide.  ***  Katia never found her parents, and when the war was over, her parents went to Katia's grave to mourn for her.  The New Girl(I forget her name)'s parents never showed up, maybe they died.  Pavle's family died during the war.  Bruno's family had mourned for Bruno, but never showed up at his grave, possibly due to the fact the town was just to sad to come back.  Bruno, Pavle, and Katia survived for 15 days total, but they all died as one, meeting each other in the after world, whatever the hell it is.  OVERALL, I seriously enjoyed this game, and nearly brought tears to my ♥♥♥♥in' eyes. I left some details out, mainly because I forgot about them. Katia did some bad things, Pavle did some good things, Bruno helped in every way possible, but didn't go out scavanging.  All in all, I rate this game a ♥♥♥♥in' 9.3/10, it's a very, VERY good game. It was thought and planned out very well, and I ♥♥♥♥in' loved it. Get it now, before the daily deal ends.",

            "review_text": "While not the flashiest game around, and deceptively simple with its side action scrolling display, This War of Mine is a game that can be both riveting and engrossing.  This isn't a game for those looking for tons of action or a shoot em up. This is a thoughtful game of resource management mixed with sneaking around while on scavenging missions.  You start with anywhere from 1 to 4 characters (randomly generated initially) and your goal is to survive the war. The length of the war is random (25-45 days), and there are numerous randomly generated events to make every survival experience somewhat different.  Some of the random events include illness, attacks by night time raiders, the onset of winter (and extreme cold), and snowstorms and combat making some areas inaccessible. Aside from this the locations you visit have more than one version. You might enter an area that is free of hostile forces. On another playthrough they can be filled with soldiers, rebels or thugs. The locations are also not all available at the start of the game but are instead unveiled throughout the game over time.  Throughout the game you are confronted with moral decisions. Do you help someone or not? Everytime you help someone requires a sacrifice that can cost you in the short term either in terms of time, resources, or risk of injury and potentially death. However, turning away all requests for help can lead to negative consequences on morale. And if someone wants to join you do you value the extra pair of hands more than having another mouth to feed?  Similarly, you'll be presented with opportunities to make hard choices on your scavenging runs. Do you take advantage of the weak? Do you kill innocents? Do you confront those doing wrong or let it happen?  Adding to replayability the resources immediately available to you are also randomly generated. On one play through you'll find you have more than enough wood or parts, on another you'll struggle to find electrical components, weapons or food at your starting location. As the game continues you'll find you never have everything you want or need which forces you to prioritize what you want to build and when.  On top of this your scavenging runs are further constrained by a fixed amount of backpack space. Depending on the character doing the scavenging the amount of space can range from 8 spaces to 17 spaces (1 character), with most having around 10 to 12 spaces.  Similarly, the status of your starting characters are slightly randomized. Sometimes they can start as ill or wounded (slowing you down and forcing you to manage your people more carefully as well as consuming important items like medical supplies).  This is a very good game that will appeal to most but not all. It has solid replayability and multiple ways to win.  One warning, this is a somewhat unforgiving game with a steep learning curve.  There is no 'save' option other than a daily autosave (in case of a crash) which is automatically updated upon a major event (like a character death). In other words, if characters die you'll have to keep the group going in spite of the repercussions on the team.  That said, the first time you 'survive' the war with no team deaths you will feel like you've accomplished something.",

Now her child is sobbing over her lifeless corpse and her father and husband is coming down the stairs. You book it out of there because you want your character to stay alive, but after you make it home you realize that you have nothing from that night and that the charcter you sent out to scavenge is horribly depressed. After all, he was only a celibrety chef, and nothing prepairs you for taking a ultimately innocent life.   In short, this game makes you decide. 'How far are you willing to go for survival?'",

I've just started playing it and hope to play more over the holiday break.  The most interesting thing I've found about This War of Mine is that it forces you to plan ahead. You're not going to hit a point where you think you've got a good handle on your current situation, and that you're comfortable knowing nothing is going to go wrong. You always have to think about what the next problem is going to be, and how you're going to plan for it. The game is well balanced, and the different elements (food, meds, weapons, trade..) that you have to manage are well balanced and each have a significant role to play in your planning for survival.  Each new game has fairly randomized events and locations, though as you get to a second or third play through you start noticing a pattern and that some of the events are scripted, for example,    going to the market in the first few days will have 3 armed looters, and going to the market at the end of your first week will always have a soldier trying to sexually assault a young girl  . This doesn't take away from the experience though, and will be mitigated with new content.  My first play through lasted 39 days, which isn't all that great, and it ended with the shooting death of one character, another lost to illness, one fleeing my shelter, and the last committing suicide.  Overall, definite purchase for anyone who likes strategizing in games, and a great addition to anyone's library.",

Should you rob from other survivors or aid groups to survive.  Your people will fight each other, over your choices. They'll get depressed, sick, injured, hungry and you'll have to decide to provide them with their vices or trade them away for supplies and materials.  You can avoid combat for most the game, with the exception of being raided at night. Nothing like having a safe stockpile, only to be raided and wind up losing most your food and a severly injured defender.  Combat itself could be improved a little, I only used the knife and pistol. The knife was constant click which wasn't bad and worked out better than using a pistol. For the pistol, it looks like there is an aim mechanic, but combat happens so quickly that I burned through six rounds, the bandit was still standing, and killed me with his shotgun.   When you start losing people, the game takes on another challenge.  When winter comes, get ready to break everything you can to keep the house warm, people fed, and fight off sickness.  ",

If you keep doing it, the level of depression of certain members of your group could be so bad that they become unable to complete even basic tasks related to self preservation, or worse, they'll leave the group or commit suicide!   This War of Mine is a gritty, in your face game about the struggles of the masses in a war torn area. Where can I get food? Should I kill just to provide food for my people? Can I just steal to provide for my group? How will stealing/ killing defensless people affect the mental state of my group? Should I steal medication from the hospital I just donated medication to?  It's a well executed game that I really enjoyed. I do have a lot more play time than what steam says I do though as I play offline anytime I can while I'm at work on the ship. My reccomendation is that if you're looking for something that's not your common war simulator, but is a peek into the other side of the coin, then give this a try. I enjoyed it and I think you will too.",

However, when it comes to individuals, though I can see the effort is made (every character has their own story and different traits), the lack of immersion in the individual level is shown, players think more as a group rather than each individuals. I can't tell if this is intended or not, but in my opnion this is a flaw. Also, if more randomization and customisation (difficulties, customized characters and skill system) can be added this will be a great game.

By the same token, few games have been able to elicit genuine emotion from me.  That said, this game is an instant classic in the steam library and a must have for those looking for a neat twist on the survival genre. You play as a group of survivors in a war torn city just trying to make ends meet. You’re lucky if you don't get shot by rebel soldiers or fellow scavengers, and luckier if you get to eat that day. Go through the day trying to mediate the needs of your own group with that of your neighbors and then journey into the night looking for supplies to keep yourselves going. There will be moral challenges, yes, but not necessarily any repercussions. Careful and clever players will find ways to commit crimes with impunity; however, this does not mean you will escape the emotional consequences, as your party attempts to cope with the atrocities they commit to survive in war. Teamwork is necessary, but others… they are expendable. Or, perhaps, you value their lives and will attempt, at all opportunities to be good and ethical – good luck.  Ultimately the game is a masterpiece, forcing a set of mind of survival and melancholia with its powerful imagery, music and dialogue. I’m only about 15 hours in, and I want more; and so will you.  Also, the soundtrack is free and it’s a pretty nice listen. So, there’s that.",

Each night you send out one person to scavange for 'things to survive.' After 20 or so days, id given a girl (stealthy one at that) haven in the house. This is both good and bad. its good because that means that if i need to sneak around a place, i can send her out instead of my heavy hauler....but bad because now i have to feed her and have a bed for her too. Anyway, 20 or so days in i no longer had any 'safe / happy' areas left to scavange from....this meant I was forced to either wait and hope for the best...or go visit an elderly couples place. i did so and proceeded to rob them blind. Thier son tried fighting back...I then was forced to kill all 3 of them (passivly on the elderly couple as i took all thier stuff to live) and that lasted me another 10 days or so...the food started running out, and that meant the other elderly couple that had lost their son in the war was the next stop. I had a choice, steal their stuff and save 4 lives...or let the old woman and man die from stealing their medications and food. Again, I was forced to steal from them...but now I had no one to take from but a hospital, church, or a warehouse full of thugs. Thinking that my stealthy girl could get in get a full pack and run....i sent her...sadly she's dead now and im back to the original 3. War is hell...",

Learn from your mistakes, watch your group deteriorate and fall in to depression as the war forces you to make some of the hardest choices. Learn to love and hate the characters, and be sad to see some of them go. Will you save the weakest links? Or will you let your darwinian side take the best of you?  Just as you thought you had it all going, the harsh reality of the war raging outside will tear it all away in a heart beat. Your closest friends might turn on you and leave you with nothing. Scavangers might steal all you've worked so long and hard for. The cold might choke the life force out of you, and you will be forced to send children starving home to their sick parents. Might be one day left of the war for all you know, but that day might as well be your last.   No saving. No retrying from checkpoint. You get one shot in making it through, as you play the real victims of war in this epic survival strategy game.. Hours 'wasted', but hours so deeply enjoyed!  10/10 Well worth the money!  (ps: If all you are in to are FPS and/or sport games, this game might not be for you, worth a try anyway though!)",

There is plenty to like about this game it is unique, has that addictiveness that makes you want to play for hours, it is challenging and makes you think, and about 5 mins in i was already hooked and ended up pulling an all nighter. But it has its problems, and after awhile you will start to feel frustrated. some things just don't make sense, like how i have to filter rain water when i am going to be boiling it while using it to cook anyways, or how a wooden board takes up the same space in my backpack as some leaves do, but these are minor issues.. The main frustration with this game is the combat system, it is wonkey, you can sneak up on a sleeping bandit with a knife, and stab him in the neck, and he still sometimes can get up, grab his gun, and kill you; or all of his friends hear you silently stab him and come kill you.. The combat system combined with the permanent death mechanic makes this game very frustrating.. There is a difference between a game being challenging, and poorly designed gameplay mechanics.. I still recomend this game, as the problems could easily be fixed, but I would wait for a sale.",

            "review_text": "(tl;dr - this is an excellent game, highly challenging, with strong atmosphere and a real sense of how difficult it is for ordinary people to survive in a war zone)  I came to This War of Mine having just finished reading a book about the Siege of Leningrad in 1941-42. It turned out to be the perfect preparation.  TWOM is not like other survival games, with an emphasis on shooting your way out of trouble. In fact, it's more than possible to go for an entire game without once experiencing any kind of combat. If that makes the game sound easy or boring, think again. RIght from the outset, your small group of survivors is left to fend for themselves, using any means of staying alive - scrabbling through piles of debris for scraps of food, wood, material, mechanical parts, anything to make their lives in their half-bombed shelter bearable.  During the day it's too dangerous to leave their shelter, so the survivors spend their time building makeshift workshops, eating barely-edible meals made up of dead rats and scavenged vegetables, melting snow to make fresh water, and playing the guitar to relieve the gloom. Occasionally someone comes to the door to offer help, or to barter goods, or to present a risky opportunity with high reward if it comes off.  During the night, one survivor in the group must go on a mission to find supplies. This could mean raiding an abandoned supermarket, ransacking a shelled building with dead bodies still inside, or sneaking through a hotel filled with dangerous, armed gangsters. There's only a limited amount of time, and a limited amount of stuff the survivor can carry - so it comes down to hard choices. Take this extra piece of food, because everyone in the group is hungry? Or sacrifice it in order to take these mechanical parts which will enable the group to build a water filter?  The game never quite gives you enough, so the resources are always stretched, and these hard choices have to be made every day. You find yourself willing a trader to come to the door so that you can barter your precious medical supplies (which you might need one day) just for an extra piece of food. And, of course, as soon as you've done that, one of your group falls ill... The game further complicates things by triggering random raids on your shelter, so that even when you think you're safe the little you have can be taken away from you. You can literally be left without food, and with half your group injured, in a single night.  It's details like these (and the fact that the game gives you no instructions whatsoever) that have led some people to complain that the game is too difficult; and the Steam forums are abuzz with people requesting the developers add in extra options and amendments to make life easier. But, in fact, once you've grasped the basics and played through a few times, a clear path to victory does emerge (although it'll be different each time). The game can almost be too easy for a seasoned player - but the challenge has been increased in the latest version, as you get to try your luck with different groups of survivors, each more helpless and limited than the previous set.  Aside from gameplay, the game is beautifully rendered in cross-section pseudo-3D graphics, with monochrome shading and a highly plausible design. You really do feel like you're in the middle of war-torn Sarajevo (the game is set in the fictional East European city of Pogoren, but the allusions to the war in Bosnia are obvious). The atmosphere throughout is gloomy, thoughtful and just the right side of depressing. You really do become attached to your little band of survivors, each with his or her own skills and drawbacks. To complete the picture, each survivor has a backstory which is revealed gradually thoughout the game, giving them a rounded personality and making the player identify more strongly with each of them.  The emphasis in the game is on realism (which is why it's hard - surviving in a war zone is no picnic, after all). Where realism is sacrificed, it enhances the gameplay, putting limits on the player which would make the game too easy if they weren't there.  TWOM isn't (usually) a heart-thumping, high-octane, shoot-em-up wartime action game; there's no shortage of them around. What it is is something rather more thought-provoking. When you take away the guns and give them all to your opponents, what do you have left? How do the little people, the non-combatants, the citizens with no access to food, warmth or weapons, survive in a situation like this? You'll lose your first few games, most likely - all your survivors dead, your heart broken. But play on, because when you finally get your people through to the end of the war, all the emotion you invested in them will be repaid.  Thoroughly recommended.",

            "review_text": "Let me start by saying that I thought that the 'survival' genre was on its way out of popularity before I started playing this game. That being said, This War of Mine is a brilliant minimalist survival experience that will have you playing through multiple times. The basic premise of the game is simply to survive the horrors of a war-torn city experiencing an armed rebellion. To do this you must control a cast of characters and fortify a shelled out home to endure the coming days. The characters you get are pre set, but you unlock more combinations of characters as you progress through the game. Each character has basic needs; hunger, sleep, and their general health (ie: keeping their wounds treated and sick characters healthy). Some characters also have additional needs that make taking care of them slightly more difficult, such as an addiction to cigarettes. These needs and wants are what will influence your decision making as you progress through the game.  This War of Mine focuses on survival, but also allows players to choose the easy way out of a situation by sacraficing their humanity in order to live. What I mean by this is that you will encounter situations where you can easily obtain food or medical supplies, but you must steal or kill to obtain them. The option to scavenge and create your own supplies exists, but if someone is dying from a gunshot wound, then you may have no choice but to rob the doctor down the street who is doing all he can to treat civilians who are injured in the conflict. Performing such an act will have a negative influence on morale, and has a chance to break the character who performed the deed, rendering them useless for some time and possibly even pushing them to suicide.  The game is not flawless. One big problem that I had was that little to no game mechanics are explained. There is no legend to tell players what icons mean, and combat is a veritable trial by fire that will most likely claim the life of the first character that encounters it. Once you have become a veteran all this will mean nothing, but as a new player to the game it can be frustrating. That is certainly the biggest error I have detected, and it is not enough to stop me from labeling this as an excellent game.  What is being presented to us as gamers is more than just another 'get wood, make fire, cook meat, live' survival game; it is The Sims meets Fallout. Control your party's emotions and physical and mental state of being. Juggle your characters needs, make or steal the weapons you need to survive, and ultimately do what you need to in order to live through the war.  9/10: highly reccomended.",

From a starters perspective, I can say that the game is gripping (and addictive to begin with), it's very tense and builds drama up rather successfully. I also found, the game doesn't really teach you how to play (which arguable supports the realism), for me, this adds to the enjoyment slightly, I like figuring things out on my own and failing once or twice means I get to learn and improve my gameplay the next time. Another positive I found was that death really is appreciated, if you kill someone innocent, then your character may become depressed or upset and really contemplate what they've done. Also - if you run out of cover in a dangerous area, you're going to get shot, and death is death in this game, there's no going back (which isn't always a bad thing, with one less mouth to feed). Some games ruin the realism of a game by allowing you to respawn over and over, but here, death is certainly taken seriously. The trading system is also very handy and in my opinion nicely balanced and easy to use. Different characters/scenarios make the game seem different and real each time.  As for some negatives, there isn't anything massive really, I think, even after 6 hours, the landscape seems slightly repetitive, which may change as I continue to play, but I'm not sure whether it will change drastically, I'm just hoping it does. Although I do believe every world is randomly generated so I might be clutching at straws here, but everytime I've spawned in, it's been in the same building and the buildings I visit have all been the same (with slightly different people or circumstances in each playthrough). I may just be slightly confused over the progression of the game. The combat system, well, it's not really a system, can be slightly annoying, and for me, unexplained, which is fine, because ultimately you are playing as civilians and are not supposed to be a combat specialist. Just at some points it felt extremely clunky and one sided. However, I do think the key is sneaking up on people and getting them that way, and in fairness, I was a footballer with a spade, against a soldier with an AK-47, but I did sneak up on him, however after that first hit, he just kept hitting me with his ak and frustratingly I couldn't get another hit in until I was lethally wounded.

Difficulty towards the middle and ending it is way too easy as i have accumulated more than 20 meat, 30 vegetables, 12 bandages, 15 medicine and many more stuff. (the only thing i'm constantly short of is component)  5. If i have an Assault Rifle i can kill 6 armed militia in a single scavanging hunt. (I don't know if that's a good thing or bad thing)  6. Cigarettes and Coffee have little to no effect on the survivors as far as i can see.   But overall this game is super awesome. Really puts you in the shoes of a civilian in a war torn country. Abit pricey to be honest but definitely recommend everyone to get it.  Edit: Game gets pretty hard when i played it again and again. Had to let the old man die because i don't have anymore bandages left for him. Sleeping doesnt heal wounds or sickness it only delays them. Most of the time the survivors are either sad or depressed, sometimes even broken. No more central market where you are buy everything with a bandage. Still managed to complete it.",

This War of Mine feels a little like XCom, in that you come to care about your characters and want them to survive, but this is a game about decisions and scarcity, and you never have what you need. You never have enough food, or water, or supplies, and somebody always has to go without... and sometimes that kills. In this game, good deeds rarely pay off at all, and more often than not you are punished for them mercilessly. This is a game about the brutal realities of living in a warzone, and the horrible acts that desperation drives human beings to.  Should you play this? Yes. It has that 'one more turn' (-like) quality that so few games achieve these days - resources are scarce and stakes are always high. But don't expect to walk away from a play session happy; this game, like it's subject matter, is all about loss, melancholy, and sadness. Good luck and godspeed.",

You can't just go into a building and shoot everyone up to obtain supplies. You really have to decide whether or not it is worth the risks - depression and wounds. When you have a character lethally wounded and not very useful on scavenges - do you sacrifice them?  When you see a girl being ♥♥♥♥♥ by a soldier in the supermarket, do you kill him or use her as a cover to loot the building? When the milita come to your door to ask if your neighbour had been stealing from international aids, do you lie to them or tell them the truth and get cigarettes and some canned food?  These are just a few of the really difficult decisions you have to make throughout the game.  After 4 run throughs, I finally survived and the war ended on day 50. I think I got really lucky in the beginning when I started off with 4 characters rather than usually the 3. Also all 3 weren't smokers or coffee drinkers so they didn't get depressed when I didn't focus on gathering cigarette supplies.  I will keep on playing this game over and over.",

To get the most out of the game, make sure not to look up any strategies or wikis for the first few hours. Once you understand all the systems it's not too hard to always survive. It's still a good *game* like that, but in my case the first few hours of flailing around trying not to die while not crossing too many moral boundaries is what left the strongest impression.

At first everything was so simple, the supplies in my house were fine and I can loot abandonded houses when the food was running low, but then things changed.  The first time I commited evil was in an old house, I had pavle looting it and found it to be inhabited, the people saw me after I stole some of their things, they tried to make me leave, I saw this as a threat, so I killed an approaching man with a gun, after this a woman cowered in fear and begged for mercy, I killed her, she wanted to kill me right? I then realised what I had done, but I was so desperate for supplies I kept going. My character had breif depression after that. I thought I had it bad then.  I was very low on supplies, a new girl asked to join my group of three and promised to pull her wait if we deided to take her in, I accepted her request. Immediently afterwards she bacame sick, I then had no medicine left.  Then my character Marko went out scavenging, there were people there. They seemed to be nice but I couldn't find what I needed searching through the rubble. Bruno was desperate for bandages, Pavles depression had been lashed out on him even though he was trying to help. I thought it would be ok if I just saw was in the private property, it would be right? Wrong. I looked through it, there was no bandages, the man whose property it was then tried to kill me. And he did. Marko died.That loss was tolerable. I had Arica scavenging for supplies, I hit the jackpot, but as I tried to leave there was a barred door, I could have easly gone around it however I intended on returning here so I decided to break it open, as I did a raider hearrd. That was Arica's end. That really did it for Pavle, he had no chance left, he just kept breaking down even more, I had to have Bruno do all of the work. They were doing ok, then Bruno died. Suicide. Things were really bad then, every night when Bruno scavenged everthing I had would be stolen.  Eventullay though tt didn't matter, I just took important things with me. Things were really looking up, I had nearly everything I needed, Bruno was well fed and had plenty of sleep, I thought I may actually be able to survive for quite a while still. There was just one problem.  Depression. Bruno commited suicide. I survived 18 days.  10/10 Would have all my characters commit suicide or die for stupid reasons again. Really though. I got more depressed than they did. It was amazingly captivating and a completely incredible experience.",

Breaking into a building I presumed was abandoned, I began to loot all possible items, I noticed that the loot was really good and very common but I carried on pushing into the ruins. I ended up bumping into two men who was nice to me and offered to trade so we did and I got a little desperately needed food in return for some ammo and water. I then went upstairs to loot from the unsuspecting party but there was one of them standing on a balcony, I questioned if what I was doing was right and of course the answer was NO.  However, I crept to the man and pulled out my hatchet and swung for him, he turned as I swung so he didn't do immediately and silently, he then retaliated to which we fought and I won but in doing so he fell backwards down a gap in the 4-story building and landed straight between his trading buddies who soon sprinted upstairs and brutally F***KED me up.

Even though I accidentally drew aggressive attention in one area, I returned with a different character to trade, and that character was treated as if they were the original trespasser and killed. #2. Fist fights killing - three hits and you're dead from none knife/gunfire. Very unrealistic. Also receiving any slight wound from fist-fights can turn into more severe degrees of being wounded. It would seem to be more inclined to make the game difficult, but it feels less believable to me personally. #3. Entering the hospital, my scavenger was told to bring any salvaged supplies to the doctor. I found medicine in the hospital and took it to give to the head doctor. He then proceeded to yell at me that those were his and he called for help, ending in the death of yet another character.

You are a few survivors, banded together in a time of war. You need to gather supplies and craft what little you can to improve your hideout and maintain your health.   But what happens when you get injured and you have no bandages? What happens when you get ill and you have no medicine? Will you give what little you have to help a sick woman whom you don't even know? Or will you give that little food you managed to gather to hungry children who just happened by?  This game is all about choices. Every night, you can send one of your survivors to scavange a location in the city. You need to choose which one you send, you need to decided what you bring back (because you have limited backpack slots), then you need to decide what you spend those resources on. There is a good amount of things you can craft: A bed to give your survivors good rest, water collector to cook meal or produce alchool, planks of wood to secure your hideout, etc. But you never know what next location is going to become available, what you will be able to bring back, if one or more of your survivors are going to become ill or wounded. And with every action comes a consequence. You are not in a game where you can kill all 'bad guy' just because you can.   On a content note: There are a good amount of different survivors (about a dozen), each having a special skill that can make it invaluable to survive. Everyday, you have time to spend in your hideout, doing crafting, trading, etc. And every night, you get to send one survivor to scavange, while you need to make your other survivors either rest, or protect your hideout from other scavengers. There are about a dozen or more different locations to explore, many 'events' to deal with, a weather system (you need to heat in the winter!), and more.  I would agree with some reviews here that, when you have completed the game, there is not much replay value, in the sense that you are just going to go through the same things, but with different characters. But if you buy the game, have no fear, you will get more than enough for your money. The music, gameplay and graphic style are all wonderfully balanced to make it interesting, depressing, scary, and everything to make you feel you are, really, just a survivor trying to live through this war of yours.",

Whenever a game about war breaks out, how it affects the civilian population is often completely overlooked. That is not the case here, and in fact, this game is entirely based on civilian survivors point of view.  Every decision you make will impact not only yourself, the other survivors with you, but any other survivor group alive in the story that you are playing. You will have to choose how to use your limited resources to best survive. Do I make a small animal trap, or board up another whole in my house to make it a little safer? Making the trap might seem like a good idea, giving you more food and all, but then suddenly, that very night, bandits raid your place and cause massive injury to those you left. All because you left that whole there and didn't put anyone on guard.   This game requires you to think outside of the norm, and consider things that you could only dream would ever happen to you.  10/10",

Katia, a notorius writer, was getting stories to write for the news from local celebrities. While Pavel was an all star athlete- Bruno was a four star chef with his own show. None which mattered when government forces surrounded the city. They lived day to day, helping their neighbors as they helped them. Protecting the innocent from both rebel and military abusers. They even let in a defenseless woman live with them in her most dire time. They were Heroes in every way.   Until one day- Katia needed medicane for Bruno as he was uncoditionally ill with something the immune system couldn't fend off alone, and went to the auto repair shop to trade with a man living there. The man trading wanted more than we could offer, food, weapons, Jewelary. She knew it was the mans life or Bruno. So she rushed toward the man with her knife only to be shot before she could make the first slice. Her death brought suffering in Pavel who felt her death must be avenged. To make the man realize what he had done. The next night, he left bruno on his own to settle that score. With only 2 rounds and a hand gun he killed him but not to recieve one to his stomach as well. Bursting inside the shop, he sees a sick man, the father of the late trader and killer of your bestfriend. He too saw death. With everything he needed he limped back to home to give Bruno those meds he was in desperate need.   With Bruno doing better... Pavel bled out and died the next night. And the woman they protected and nurtured- gone. With their food and belongings taken with her. Bruno found his best friends cold corpse on the bed with Katias diary in his arms smothered in blood. He trembled on his cigarette and let it fall to the floor. Both were dead. And that was to much to bear for himself. With what little parts they had left, he assembled a noose as his final project, his final dish. He smokes his last cigarette and carved into beam that the rope was tied from, 'I'm sorry i couldn't return the favor'. Sobs fill the basement as shots are heard in the distance... The basement was silent- 3 days later the war had finally ended. RIP Katia Day 1-15, Pavel Day 1-16, Bruno Day 1-17.   This was my first 'story' and let me tell you. It was a story alright.

I cannot play this game for too long, usually one in game day, before I have to get up for a while because of the draining atmoshpere and desperate tone. In my opinion, if a game can make itself so heavy on the player but keeps them in, then it knows what it’s doing. Regrets, sympathy, despair. There's little happiness this game offers and it shouldn't, because that's how I imagine it'd be like in the character's place.  This game makes you weigh the costs and moralities of every action. But in the end it's less about the game and more how you handle these problems.  For me a lot of the experience was not rewarding, even when I achieved the small things I wanted to achieve, there was more to be done and there was always a consequence. I always felt the need to gain the unachievable well-being of of all my characters, and never did. What pushed me forward was the ambiguous ending of the war.  Overall, fantastic emotional experience that lies within the player and certainly leaves an impact. Wonderfully crafted style, narrative and tone. The most realistic war simulation I know.",

There two types of gammers that wll enjoy This War of Mine;  1) Sims players who are sick to death of the Saccharin nature of The Sims but love the game play.  2) Survival fans looking for something different.   This War of Mine is a cold and brutal look at the cost of war, not from the point of view of the soldier but from the innocent bystander caught between two armies. Scrounging for food and materials takes up most of your time, everyone is cold and starving, and just when you think you are getting comfortable; you are raided by bandits and robbed blind. Back to the cold and hungry situation. You will be confronted sooner or later with choices that come down to either starving or robbing other innocent people of all they have to survive. And no matter what option you take, you will have to face the consequences of your actions. In this brutal war there are brutal choices.   There is little to no combat in this game, and rightly so. This is NOT war game, it is a hard scrabble survival game. If you are looking for a lighter FPS go ahead and skip this game, it is not ment for you. But if you are a fan of the survival story this may be what you have been waiting for.   Game play is similar to a platform shooter, point and click to cause your charicters to move from point to point. Actions take time and the interface is well set to allow multiple charicters to be busy at their own tasks at the same time. The graphics are well done but intentionaly washed out and depressing, don't expect amazing vistas or inspiring sites, this game is cold and dark.   Only a few hours into this game and I am looking forward to more. Rated 8/10  OK review revsion: Having played through the game once, much of my prior review stands. TWOM is a very good story and is probably one of the better indy games to come out in recent years. The story is compelling and the epiloge is actualy fairly moving. I am going to down grade my rating for one reason alone. The game is short. Far too short for a full price purchas, but when this game goes on sale make sure you get your self a copy.  Rated 7/8",

Ability to do a campaign like game or create your own story.  CONS: Could probably be 10x more fun with small additions. Suspension of disbelief issue when you're starving, you steal some food from a hospital, then your entire team breaksdown in depression, causing them to starve or commit suicide. Your people have predefined personalities that don't change enough when desperation strikes. They would rather kill themselves than steal a can of tuna in some cases.

            "review_text": "There have been a slurry of survival games, and most of them are (frankly) crap. Too easy, too predictable, too linear, too beta, there's a thousand things that can be wrong with a survival game. This game avoids those problems, as well as could be expected.   Resources aren't completely scarce, but they're used in large quantities, and even with ~20 of an item, you won't get a lot of use out of it. This feels just right, since I never felt comfortable with my situation, but I was also constantly crafting, building, and shifting priorities. Maybe i was flush for wood/materials, but I was out of food. Once I was good on food, I needed more materials to make water filters, or something like that. It felt difficult to survive, and that's what I want from a survival game.  Alongside food and rest, there's a 'emotion' value for each character, too. They become sad when they see atrocities, and will progress into depression and eventually become 'broken' and uncontrollable if you don't give them books, music, or other nice things to relieve the stress. I appreciated that in games like Don't Starve, and I appreciate it here, too.  The scripted encounters with NPCs are well done, with decent dialogue and enough ambiguity to keep you guessing what their real intentions were. The only problem with scripting these is that it's too easy to 'game' it after seeing the encounter. Your second, third, and subsequent playthroughs will feel less 'survival', and more 'metagame.' Other games (like FTL) solve this problem by randomizing outcomes, or adding other factors into the outcome of a dialogue choice, rather than just your choice (maybe your inventory, character being used to speak to the NPC, or location change the relative outcome of the encounter). But TWOM glues itself to rails. That's forgivable.  But let me level with you, the combat sucks. Unlike the rest of the game, there's no 'soft introduction' to combat. And that can be fine, if combat made any sense. You have to deliberately switch to 'combat mode', which entirely changes the environment actions you can use. Except that none of those actions are explained to you, and you have to spend a couple minutes examining icons and trying them out, hoping that you don't wind up making noise as you do.   You can never sneak up on enemies, their ESP goes off when you get closer than ~5ft to them - even if they're sleeping. And when you do, in fact, fight them, there's no feedback about how you're supposed to fight them. My first battle was a fistfight with someone whose house I'd broken into - but after madly clicking on the guy, the only thing i'd accomplished was my character sprinting in a circle around him. I tried to flee, but then my character inexplicably decided he couldn't go through the enemy, and wound up being lethally beaten. The next few combat scenarios ended up like this too, with the controls getting in the way, and lack of feedback failing to inform me *what* i was supposed to do. At one point i managed to knife a gunman to death, steal his pistol, and fire it at his compatriot. I was pretty sure that bullets, when they hit someone, were are pretty lethal thing. Unfortunately, they did less damage than punching him, and with one shotgun blast he killed my character.  This really wouldn't be so bad - every game has a learning curve. But when your character is dead forever, your other characters are stricken by grief (sometimes to the point of being suicidal or uncontrollable), and you need to *start a new game* to get back on track, that's a bad deal. It feels distinctly unfair to have the drop on an enemy, execute a well-planned ambush with the right weapon, at the right time, from the right angle, with no possibility of failure - and the game arbitrarily decides that it'll never work. Not just that it *randomly* won't work, but that your ambush *couldn't* work; it'll never work no matter how many times you try. And because you tried that entirely reasonable ambush, you now need to restart the whole game just to get back to where you were. That's frustrating.  Overall, play it. You'll like it. But just be aware that it has some player feedback and logic issues.",

I unique and interesting concept nicely executed but bogged down by some conflicting mechanics and somewhat over stylization.  The concept is very interesting and fairly well executed considering there isn't much of a precedent for this kind of thing. A horror story told in the periphery of a war instead of in it. But if you are already here you already knew that, and you want to know if that interesting concept turned out any good.  Well, yes and no. While it did have some really strong moments all done entirely through game play, many times the 'game' part of it interfered with the mood it was trying to set. Keeping everyone feed and happy enough to keep going sometimes got tedious. And while the game works really hard to characterize each refugee with an individual story, thoughts and opinions, It just fell short of catching my sympathy and it made it really frustrating when their feelings conflicted with my own. There was frequently a tremendous difference between my motivations (succeeding at a game) and their's (surviving a war without losing their humanity). Other games have done this (Spec Ops: The Line specifically), but the opportunity was missed to make the dissonance between player and character poignant and it ended up just being frustrating. It certainly drove the point home that the average civilian really is not prepared for a war and the experiences it brings, but it hammers the point home a little too hard. The game worries so much about the player disconnecting that it grabs the playing by the shirt and says, 'AREN'T YOU PAYING ATTENTION!', and I found it making my slightly hostile to the point the game was trying to make.  If you are wondering if this game is worth your time and money it absolutely is. For all the over-empowering, testosterone driven, one man army and 'realistic' war games that have been made since the early days of gaming, it is worth remembering that wars really are quite horrible for everyone except those who do not directly interact with it in any way. As an Iraqi War veteran, I know what it's like when the public does not fully comprehend what it means to go to war, for the people who fight it or the people unfortunate enough to get caught by it. War is not hell, it's worse because it's real.. 'This War of Mine' is not perfect, but it is very much worth your time and support.",

That said, I did appreciate the challenge of properly allocating resources and skills, and like all good sims the desire to make my environment 'better' got addictive pretty quickly.   What's impressed me most about 'This War of Mine' so far is how relentless it is. There's little in the way of combat, and the fighting you do encounter is more likely to make you feel powerless and angry rather than victorious, even if you win. Death carries significant weight in this game, whether it's the loss of a companion or the execution of a stranger over a cache of resources. Awful things happen randomly, and often enough they occur just when you can least afford them. You're constantly aware of the fact that you're barely scraping by, teetering on the edge of disaster.

New locations, new characters, alternative ‘home’ bases to start from, new craftables, even a new period setting are all something I’d love to see added. Scavenging with multiple characters and the ability to upgrade backpacks would also be a good addition.  WW1 would be particularly appropriate setting fleshed out with new characters, recognisable locations and real life events but maybe that’s scope for a sequel.

I tried the nice way, taking only what nobody else claimed, that didnt work for long. Constant bandit attacks left my people despressed, wounded, and without food. On day 15 it all fell apart: No food to cook and no supplies to make weapons or tools, everybody is broken or depressed. That night I can only keep my people inside. We are attacked once more, Boris dies of his wounds, Pavle starves to death, and Bruno leaves never to return. Katia is the only one left. On day 16 I am able to trade for some bandages and a little food, just enough to make it to that night. That night is my last chance to survive, I need food. I go to the home of a couple unwilling to trade, my only option is to steal. I make it halfway through the house when I see the wife run upstairs to get her husband saying that there is an intruder, 15 seconds later he comes running and immediately attacks me. I am able to defend myself until he surrenders, he's just barely alive, I stab him one more time to finish it. There can be no failure on my part tonight. The wife rushes towards me, I'm thinking she is going to attack me for killing her husband. She collapses at my feet over his dead body and begins sobbing, I finish my looting listening to her cry. I return the next morning to find that I have been robbed again, this time they took everything, that coupled with the events of taking my first life leave Katia broken and unable to continue. That night she kills herself. She had survived 17 days.",

There is no tutorial other than try and error. It requires alot of thinking and decicion making. Supplies that can be scavanged are scarce and when all are gone you must either make them, steal or barter.   Pros: + original concept + minimalistic climate + interesting characters +clearly alot of research done on civilians surviving in cities under siege  Cons: - made me stop playing WoT for a while... - pricey for what it delivers in terms of graphics and other tech stuff, even soundtrack is near non-existant. It is only my opinion but I have willingly paid for it in hope it will help the devs stay on the market and hopefuly provide extensions and updates (free of charge) at least for a while.

You will have to decide, whether you will take the honest path and share with the other survivors or if you choose to kill for your basic human instincts.  Your characters will react to their actions. A murdering scavenger killing innocent people for food will get depressed and may commit suicide.   Another problem is that the game tries to be very unspecific, it doesn't name a specific location for the war, takes ordinary people as characters, has no voice-over and gives no backgroundstory on anything. It's basically 'You are a normal person. There is war. Survive.' And don't get me wrong, I know that this is used to show that war can hit anyone, but it makes the characters and dialogues/monologues seem very flat and unauthentic.  Maybe the developers can give the characters and monologues/dialogues a bit more depth while still keeping the aspect of showing that war can hit anyone.

For example, if you choose to steal from an old couple, even though you retrieve enough food to last a few more days, the fact that you practically left the old couple to die, haunts you for like weeks. And somehow your friends know it too. And they gossip about that as well.  Or if you killed someone just to get their food and ammo, it can be even more depressing.  On the other hand, if you hurt yourself by fending someone getting robbed/♥♥♥♥♥. Yes, there was such a scene.

            "review_text": "I'm not going to lie, this game WILL give you the feels. I'll have to give you an example;  I created a custom character, Aleksi. Aleksi, was made with my photograph, so naturally I tried to keep him alive as long as I possibly could. Entering the game for the first time, Aleksi, Emilia and Bruno were attempting to brave the horrors of war... and failed.  The downward spiral started after Aleksi came back from scavenging, and Emilia had become slightly ill. I thought that we would be fine, as I had the meds to keep her in one piece. However, the next night, Bruno got sick too. Extremely sick. I started to trade away food for meds. My people were getting hungry, and I had to chop up the bed to give wood to the trader for food. After getting 3 cans worth of food, Bruno was the only one in any shape to go scavenge.  He was shot dead for no reason by an unknown number of women in an apartment building. All he had on his person was a couple of planks of wood.  Emilia got sicker and sicker, and I sent Aleksi to the same apartment building with a shotgun, out of blind frustration and hatred at how far I had come, only for it to be dashed in front of my eyes. After killing the one with the shotgun, Aleksi hid in the shadows to ambush the others. When her friends came, they all broke down over her body, and reminisced to times long ago. I realized how horrible what I had done was; this wasn't some random death in a videogame, without moral repercussions. I murdered someone, and albeit they did it first, that's not an excuse to be like them.  When I tried to have Aleksi run away, another one pulled a gun. After being shot twice with a handgun or something, Aleksi butchered all of them with his shotgun. I got meds, and food, enough to keep everyone alive until the ceasefire, as I only had four more days left.  Emilia fell victim to the sickness.  I only just managed to bandage up Aleksi enough to keep him from bleeding out.  Over the next days, he fell into the status 'Broken', and promptly committed suicide.  TL;DR  This game made me cry at my own actions. I cried. Why I keep playing is a mystery to myself, I am ♥♥♥♥♥♥ my soul.  9.6/10",

I dont really feel so much like i am 'playing' when i play this game, there is way too much drama and humanity in it.   I have a few friends that lived as civilians in a war-torn country, and have been horrified at the stories they have told me. This game makes me feel like i have tasted that a little (even though i am in a nice warm house in a comfortable chair) The fact that there are millions of people right now actually living their lives like this right now is a horrible thought.

I starded off fairly well, had some trouble with raiders, but got by. About eleven days in, I sent Marko to scavenge a church and he was killed when I sent him near a bandit. From there, the remaining three spiralled down to sadness, then depression, and then they either died or left. At thirty days, Bruno, the last one there, commited suicide. I was almost in tears. That is the second time a game has saddened me to the point of crying.   Its reliance on interractions and morals both good and bad, and stealth make for great mechanics. The use of bios, addictions, radios and other luxuries, and journal entries add an atmosphere that some games just can't implement.  The game still has its fair share of flaws, though. Ending the day before six-thirty pm means you miss chances to trade or assist people, which essentially means you just lost free supplies, or you pushed your survivors closer to suicide. If you go to scavenge, paranoia will make that rat upstairs into an agressive bandit, and while I appreciate that attempt to make you cautious, a two pound rat is much quieter than a two-hundred pound man who is also armed to the teeth (movement is indicated with red blips, and all the blips are the same size, btw).   I would honsetly rate it a 9.4/10 altogether, the gameplay is tedious, but never agitating, it portrays what it intends to portray, and is an emotional rollercoaster from start to finish. If you want a game that is also an interactive expirience where your decisions actually do affect gameplay, this is your kind of game.  (Sorry about the essay)",

The atmosphere is intence and affects you almost immediately; you feel the weight and depression that comes with the war atmosphere. The gameplay is simple and stream-lined. Overall, the game is genuinely addicting and fun to play.   The main downside is that there is a bit of a learning curve with the game. The first couple of playthroughs were incredibly difficult and I could not figure out get through 15 nights, let alon the whole war! But after some trial-and-error and help from the internet, I was able to figure out how to play, the best strategy, etc. Pro tip: If you are having trouble with the set storymodes, just create your own story/game mode with the survivors you think are best, adjust the war settings, etc. That was the best way to get over the learning curve and become comfortable with the gameplay. After that, I felt like I could handle any of the other story modes.   Finally, the story and background is interesting, but I wish there was more! You never get a full story about the war, why it started, or in-depth details about the world outside. Any information you get is through short clips from the radio, clues found across the locations, and some comments from the survivors themselves. Honestly, this just adds to the experience! It drives home the point that war is just universally pointless and awful; it does not really matter how the war started or who is in the 'right' because it is innocent people who suffer. I do wish there was more meat behind the characters: The diary entries are nice, but a lot of the characters just come off bland and forgettable. I would love if there were more diary entries that shared individual character experiences and thoughts so that they were more fleshed out. But that is just a nit-picky issue for a game that is really great.  Ultimately, this game is wonderful experience that makes you want to put so many hours into it without realizing it. I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a unique, emotional game that is sure to affect you on so many levels.",

As the game unfolds, you learn more about each character's past and how they came to be in this spot and time. In all the gloom and dreary, its a fantastic game to play through. There is even a cooperative board game being produced of this game (for 1-6 players) on Kickstarter.",

However, the originality is in the setting and the tone. When you take food away from a ruined building, you get the sense that this was somebody else's stash and that they will suffer or die because of it. You are tempted to do terrible things in order to survive. When somebody comes knocking for help, you are torn about whether you should sacrifice your hard earned items or shut them out. You are filled with the hopelessness of the situation and you never feel it's a game that can be won in the conventional sense.",

Rob robbers by sneaking or killing, rob innocents and hospitals. You collect trash from derelict places for supplies. Eat anything. Anything.  If you don't starve to death, die by illness, freeze to death, die by wounds inflicted by continuous assaults to your house, sniper fire, too risky salvaging trip or your team fighting eachother then... Well... Then they probably will be sad, depressed or broken. Or they abandon your team and steal it's possessions on their way. Or lay in hangover, weeping and crying. From day to day.  Places vary from game to game : loot you find, characters you meet, dangers you are pitted against. You never know what to take with you when going to raid after supplies. Weapon - knife, axe or gun. Or makeshift tool like shovel or crowbar to go past obstacles - be them concrete, wood or flesh and bones. Or saw and lockpick for grates and locks. Or items to barter with some not-so-hostile NPC's. Ofcourse you can kill them or steal from them. If your character can live with his actions. Whatever you take with you takes space from loot you're able to carry back so it's better to choose well.  It's all about suffering and pain from the hopeless start to the very unhappy ending. Because you know, there's no happy endings in war, only choices to make, survival or death. Little meaningless people trying to struggle through hell. Alone. Suffering. Depressing? Oh yeah! Fun? Not really. Interesting? Definitely. Enjoyable? In it's own masochistic way.  It is possible to achieve different kind of endings to the story. Not to just survive but achieve characters own personal goals. It is possible to do few single heroic acts. Odds are always against you. So be ready to enjoy your victories with grain of salt.  If your character dies it is permanent for that playthrough. This makes both wins and failures feel like personal wins or losses. You will be genuinely happy if you do well. And it will really ♥♥♥♥ you off when you fail. Ragequit is not a remote possibility.  This game makes you think about what you value most. In the end, if you manage to do one or two unselfish 'humane' decisions and still survive... Even that feels good. Characters do have personality : some of them you like, others you tolerate. Or not. Even NPC's are well scripted. Most of them feel like believable characters. To hear them talking about atrocities, crimes they are going to do, about their miserable lives, their kills... Oh boy. Best and worst of mankind. You will hate those heartless murderers even when you see some of their point of view. And the price you pay for your little piece of heaven. Or bread. It will cost you. LOT.  Most important thing about this game though : it really makes you value your own life, everything you have. From food and water to warmth of home and friends. And it makes you value peace.  There's shot down wall in the game with graffiti that summarizes it all.  F*** The War.",

            "review_text": "I saw this game and it went instantly onto my wishlist. Before I could even consider buying it for myself on pay day, it was gifted to me by my stepfather, who had thought 'Oh, this looks kinda neat.' He didn't even notice it was on my list.  Now, we haven't had the same taste in games for a long, long while, but we both agreed on the potential of this game to be engaging and addictive. If I had only known how, I probably would have re-gifted to a friend.  My first three days of ownership were spent glued to the screen, trying to make every scrap of food last, keeping the shelter warm through the winter, and praying for enough ammunition to hold off the increasingly-frequent bandit raids with the one handgun I had managed to salvage. I checked the radio religiously every day, making sure to scan all stations every time, for news from outside the city. I was doing everything I could to make it, and was doing well, despite the trials.  Then, it all fell apart.  As I was preparing to log out after my third bingning session, I noticed that Paval had gotten ill. Nothing major, but we had no medicine and nothing to trade away to get more. Boris was injured after a bandit attack and couldn't go out when night came. Everyone else was exhausted with fatigue and hunger. I made a tough call and decided to play a little longer, so that I could take care of the situation before logging in and getting caught-up in something unrelated where the sniffles would turn deadly.  Paval, feverish and unwell but otherwise functional, was sent out to scavenge. The only place with medicine that hadn't been raided was a warehouse overrun with rebel fighters who were not at all happy about me showing up the last time. Shots had been fired but wounds had long since mended and a bit of valuable loot was taken away in the process. This time, there was no way I could manage.  Time for the tough call in-game. I glanced to my girlfriend, sleeping a few feet away, and knew that I was going to catch hell about staying up so late and waking her as I crawled into bed. I knew it was going to suck and I'd feel like crap but, hey, I was about to have that in real life, so why not go for the full monty?  The house at the edge of town had an old couple living in it alone. They'd managed to avoid the worst of the war's problems and somehow still had everything intact. I snuck in, crept upstairs, and managed to steal some medicine from the bedroom. I began back down when the old man caught me on the stairs. Busted. It was either fight or flee and I'd already stolen from these poor folks, so I wasn't about to sucker punch the geezer. I was about to bolt when he said something that haunted me (and my characters) for days afterwards: 'Please, don't hurt us! Take anything you want, just leave my wife's medicine! She's very ill.'  I kicked myself. How had I not thought of that? These people were old, alone, and afraid. Even if their house wasn't bombed and armed soldiers weren't snatching their supplies by force, they were victims as well. When you walk into a situation without learning about the people involved, you might make a blunder that could cost someone their livelihood, their wealth, or their life. I needed the medicine, though, and they'd talked about family nearby while I was upstairs, rummaging through their cabinets. They'd be okay. I grabbed a cigarette and some spare parts to trade and then ran with the medicine.  I got home, made sure Paval took the valuable medication for his runny nose to prevent it from getting worse, then logged out with the survivors of this hell all kicking themselves and blamaing Paval for being selfish. I felt just as rotten as he did. He was depressed for days and only became functional after a bottle of vodka. Which is to say that he snapped out of his funk long enough to start a fight with Boris and get them both hurt.  I was such a fool, but my little band was alive. The winter was almost over and, just as the weather began to get better, an unexpected knock at the door made my heart sink: the children I'd been unable to help earlier with extra food (all of my characters were starving) pleaded and begged for medicine for their sick mother. I'd been unable to help them every time they arrived and asked for even the simplest things.  Paval's depression worsened. Boris became a sad sack of human flesh laying in bed all day and rising only to eat. Everyone fell into such a horrible miasma of bad feelings and grudge-holding that tempers flared nightly. Between the bickering and fighting and bandits and armed soldiers, it was too much. Boris died of wounds suffered when a fight got out of hand. Paval, weakened by weariness, a new illness, his injuries, and depression, died in a fight with a knife-wielding man in a bombed-out school over a pair of old books and a cigarette. The other two starved to death in the basement while Paval was out trying to save them.  I have never become so attached to a character in any game as I have to those people in This War of Mine. The next playthrough saw Boris saving a young woman from a would-be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ soldier with an assault rifle inside a grocery store by choking him to the ground from behind with a shovel and then caving his skull. The others lauded him as a hero and I felt somehow redeemed from my actions in the previous playthrough. I wept with joy and cheered in triumph alongside these pixellated human beings. I suffered their grief and outrage at every setback and mistake. I mourned the passing of every one of them.  This was not a game, I decided; this was an experience.  I had to stop playing. HAD TO stop. I was spending as much time trying to just survive another day in this war-torn hell as I was at my job. I intend to return, though. Once I have enough vacation time and a girlfriend who won't make me sleep on the couch for trying to save a (virtual) life, I will return to the city and do what I can to help the survivors get by.  Until then, I will be content to sit back and remember the time I spent not playing a game, but experiencing the emotional roller coaster of my life.  1,000 / 10 Would feel like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for weeks again.",

It uses its mechanics perfectly to express the total chaos and confusion civillians feel during wartimes. The lack of any tutorials might be a bit annoying at first, but soon you realize that it enforces the game's message - no one expects to be in a war, and no one is truly ready for it. The confusion of what to do adds to the engagement of the game, rather than make it unfun.  I do, however, have a problem with the game's setting. This war of mine offers a fresh take on the survivalist genre, but it's not neccesarily a step in the right direction. The setting of war rather than, say, a zombie apocalypse proved to be a good setting and helped dramaticize the game and the decisions you make in it. However, it simply gives a false look at how wars turn out, or how people live through wars. For a game that's main message is the horrors of war, it simply does not give the most honest answer. It took the most extreme cases around, and turned them into the norm in this game.  That being said, the game is still excellent, having a stellar soundtrack and great visuals. The mechanics are well enforced, and I can still easily recommend this game for anyone. I wouldn't necessarily buy it if I were you, but lend it from a friend or something. It's a great experience, but a short one.",

Its a wonderful piece of art, you are taken deep in to the game from the very beginning, i love this game so so much that im finding it hard to express my feelings towards it. Its the PERFECT game, this is THE game i have been waiting for all my life. I love survival games, and this does it so so so well that its hard to put in to words. You gotta play it to understand what i mean. If you like survival games, or if you like games in general then i recommend you buy this and play it. Im on Day 8 now, i only came out of the game to write this review, make a cup of tea and get back to it. On day 6 i went scavenging and one of my people was ill and we were short on food, i went to the home of 2 elderly people (man and wife) and murdered them in cold blood as they sat in front of the fire place eating supper. I took everything they had.. I had to do it for my people to survive. This in turn made my charachter depressed and on Day 7 an argument broke out between the 3 of us, we talked it over and all is fine now. We have enough food and medicine to last a few more days and i gathered enough wood to make 2 beds for us to sleep in. I also found a gun stashed in the garden at another house, how i found it was i read a note that was hidden in the cupboard at the house, and i dug up the weapon. Its gonna come in handy for night time as we have been raided a couple of times already, so we should now be able to defend ourself.  I dont think this game can be improved any more, i honestly dont. But i do have some suggestions on things to add. When i raided the house of the two old couple, i wondered how nice it would be for us to move from the shelter were at now in to this new home. Maybe you could introduce an option for us to change shelters? I know this is a long shot but i can see this game played online with other people. Maybe a coop version.. Dunno what else to say, you MUST buy this game NOWWWWWW",

There two types of gammers that wll enjoy This War of Mine;  1) Sims players who are sick to death of the Saccharin nature of The Sims but love the game play.  2) Survival fans looking for something different.   This War of Mine is a cold and brutal look at the cost of war, not from the point of view of the soldier but from the innocent bystander caught between two armies. Scrounging for food and materials takes up most of your time, everyone is cold and starving, and just when you think you are getting comfortable; you are raided by bandits and robbed blind. Back to the cold and hungry situation. You will be confronted sooner or later with choices that come down to either starving or robbing other innocent people of all they have to survive. And no matter what option you take, you will have to face the consequences of your actions. In this brutal war there are brutal choices.   There is little to no combat in this game, and rightly so. This is NOT war game, it is a hard scrabble survival game. If you are looking for a lighter FPS go ahead and skip this game, it is not ment for you. But if you are a fan of the survival story this may be what you have been waiting for.   Game play is similar to a platform shooter, point and click to cause your charicters to move from point to point. Actions take time and the interface is well set to allow multiple charicters to be busy at their own tasks at the same time. The graphics are well done but intentionaly washed out and depressing, don't expect amazing vistas or inspiring sites, this game is cold and dark.   Only a few hours into this game and I am looking forward to more. Rated 8/10  OK review revsion: Having played through the game once, much of my prior review stands. TWOM is a very good story and is probably one of the better indy games to come out in recent years. The story is compelling and the epiloge is actualy fairly moving. I am going to down grade my rating for one reason alone. The game is short. Far too short for a full price purchas, but when this game goes on sale make sure you get your self a copy.  Rated 7/8",

If you are even slightly injured, that injury doesn't just go away by replenishing your HP, you have to bandage the wound and have that person rest so it can heal. Each death counts, if you kill someone else, it is a big deal, your characters become depressed and won't forget it. Even stealing can leave you feeling bad for those electronic characters.  This game can really draw you in if you let it. An example of what can happen, I sent Katia (one of the characters) to a supermarket, where she witnessed a soldier ♥♥♥♥ a woman. After that she went from the optimist of the group to depressed. Several days later I sent her to the bombed out school where she got caught looking through a homeless man's few possessions. The man attacked her, but she had a knife, and in self-defense she killed him. The next day she spiraled out of control and committed suicide.  About a week later a man named Anton stopped by. He was a mathematician before. Somehow he had been seriously wounded. I let him into my group, gave him my only bandage, and let him sleep on the bed. All my characters were sick, since it was the middle of winter at the time and I had no wood left and burned my last book, but I sent Arica to a military base with a bag full of moonshine and cigarettes to trade for food and medicine, she was shot dead. Several days later, after Anton had recovered, he stole all our supplies and left.  By the end of winter my original three survivors were no longer surviving, I was down to an older lady and a mechanic, both of whom joined my group late game. Every night raiders were successful at stealing from me, while my scavenging missions were less and less successful. I briefly considered restarting the game there, both of my characters were sick, one was wounded and all I had left were two coffee beans, a lock pick and some electrical parts, but I realized their story had to end, even if they all died. So I used that lock pick to open a dresser in a nice family's house where I found all their cans of food, components and medicine and I almost cried in real life, that was enough to get me by for the last several days.  Finally, around day 45, the war ended and I had two survivors. Then the game played a montage of every good and bad thing I had done. I was a little ashamed of some of the things I did, such as stealing from a defenseless old couple in the middle of winter.   Overall it was a great game, sure there was an occasional glitch and some game play aspects seemed clunky. But no game has ever gotten me so involved in the story as This War of Mine. I would definitely suggest it to anyone.",

Your resources are limited, time is precious, and you will be constantly be making decisions on what you will bring back to the shelter with your limited inventory space.  Wood ? Sure I'll take that we need a lot of it, wow heck it takes a lot of space.  Components ? Yes, I have to build a lot of stuff. Meds ? Oh yes, these fetch for a great reward when exchanged for basic components, and a cold comes faster than you might think. Food ? I don't have enough space now, we are a bit hungry, but I can come back tomorrow night for that, and starve myself a bit more. Weapon parts ? We were raided last night, we managed to fend those thieves off, but we will need at least a knife to keep them in their place the next day... Electric part ? I don't have enough space in my inventory right now, but we need to build that upgraded stove at all cost before winter freezes us to death... Books, cofee, cigarettes ? I don't have enough space in my inventory right now, but with the hunger, the sickness, we could all use some more comfort in those little things. Our cook got wounded last night when some pillagers tried to force their way in our shelter. The war front is blocking access to the hospital. He can hold himself alive by staying in bed, but we will need to find bandages fast, or learn cooking... Water ? I wish I had brought back every single drop of water when I could. All we can do now, in the middle of winter, is burn every last bit of wood and books we have to try and melt snow to get the water we need to cook some food.  A complete run lasts for about 8h, and the game cen be replayed with different set up in a really enticing way.  Once you know about the basics of the game and explored the scavenging areas available, this game is similar, but really much, much easier than 'don't starve'.   ",

            "review_text": "This War Of Mine takes a new approach to the 'post apoclipse' genre by, insted, making a game that feels real and impactful. You start out with three survivors, in my case I started with Pavel; a football player looking for his purpose in the tragity of war, Bruno; an overweight smoker but a damn good cook, and Katia; a young reporter with bargening skills. Katia was by far my favorite. Pavel was killed pretty early on by a group of militants, 'shot like a dog' to quote Bruno. But Bruno was't exactly the most likeable person himself. I distinctly remember him stealing from an old married couple, the wife was sick and the husband was too weak to fight back so Bruno just took from them. And he seemed to be the only person not bothered by this. Soon after the death of Pavel a new man arrived at the doorstep of my home looking for shelter, his name was Nicola, and of course we welcomed him into out home, and they lived happily in there own little house. It seemed somber and seprate from the war. And with nightly scavenging runs, food seemed to be in abundance.  But like all good things, this soon ended. On a supply run Katia was gathering supplies from an abandoned house, but as it happens it wasn't as vacent as she had originally thought. A young man burst though the door yelling: 'Get out of my F*****g house! I'll F*****g kill you!!!' as he shot Katia once. Katia ran for her life as the man continued to take shots, and she was hit once again before eventually escaping. This left her on the brink of death, and barely able to function, she was bandiged up and put to bed. But the house had supplies they need. So the next night Nicola went out to gather the rest of the supplies, and this time he did it with a knife. He not only found supplies though, he also found out that the yound man was surviving with his parents; an old couple no younger than 70. But he was inexperenced and was soon cought and meeting a similar fate as Katia, exept Nicola didn't get away. He was on the ground, at the feet and mercy of the young man with the shotgun. And the young man let him go.  'Just this once,' he said 'but if you ever come back, I will kill you.' Nicola's injeries were far worse than Katia's. And they were out of bandiges. Nicola died soon after. Enraged by his death, Katia decieded that she would deal with the pain of her wounds, and she would take everything from the bastrds that killed Nicola. But insted she ran into the young man's old father. He screamed for help and by instinct; Katia stabbed him twice. The young man and his mother didn't even fight back this time. They just sat at the old man's courpse and cried silently. Katia died the next day, from what no one was sure. Maybe it was from blood loss, maybe from the overdose of pills she took to end her own life. Either way, Katia was dead and nothing in hell was gonna bring her back.  Then Naomi came. She was a happy, upbeat musican that seemed to carry a good energy where she went. But it wasm't enough help Bruno. He became severly depressed, and insted of taking the easy way out like Katia, he took all the food they had and ran while Naomi was sleeping. Now Naomi lives alone, unable to find food, unable to stay warm, unable to heal from a wound she god defending from looters. She counts the days until eventually hunger, the cold, or even her own depression overtakes her.  This War Of Mine is not a game, it is an experence, and one that must be played. I have never felt so attached to anything other than my cat, then I was to these imaginary people that seemed to real, and personal and amazing. I wish you the best of luck.

But, the danger doesn't only come from the armed forces, but also from other survivors; even from within your own group.  You have to plan ahead, be prepared for anything and if needed take some hard measures to achieve your goal. In this game you're not a hero. You're just trying to survive in one way or the other.  So, but, how does this actually work? Well, you're basically bartering, helping (or not) and crafting throughout the day. During the night you go out to scavenge and manage other smaller, but very important tasks. (Not telling what exactly, but it's well done)  This goes on and on for as long as possible, but never gets dull. That is, if you're up for a game with a really very mature content.",

Cons -You need to wait for your character to do things - even if it's only a short wait, it kind of makes the game run at a slower pace.  -Kind of repetitive.  I would recommend it if you like survival/stealth games. It has potential to replay with different characters and create your own etc, but after 15 hours I've had enough.

The game is also quite hard and requires a lot of planning and patience.  The Good Things: -Non-Linear Storyline. There are many different stories to pick (After you finish the first one) and many different scenarios to witness in the many different places you can visit. If you are angered by a soldier who is going to ♥♥♥♥ a woman you can change it's outcome!, If you are worried about some kids with a sick mother who is about to die you can change her fate! The survivors reveal their story over time and comment on actions of other survivors.  -Realistic Combat. Except for the bullets and stealth, the combat is very realistic. Players don't have more health over enemies (Unless you're playing as Boris or Roman), and killing is not always the option because some enemies will surrender.  -Realistic Simulation. There is no Easy, Normal, or Hard, there is only Realism. When the tempertures drop, people can get sick. When crime is on the rise, the group will suffer a lot of raids. When survivors are depressed, the group falls apart.  -Different ways to play. Players don't always have to steal food. They could trade for it or even grow their own. Players don't always have to use stealth kill enemies, with enough bullets and body armor they could rush in and shoot everyone.  -Beautiful Graphics. The graphics perfectly captures a war zone and contributes alot to the atmosphere. By the looks of it  the game seems to take place around eastern europe during the 1990s.  -Shows us what war really is. This game is a big ♥♥♥♥ you to people who support wars or even play the so called 'Game of the Year' Call of Duty or similar. It shows us that the Military will do anything for 'Glory' and will abuse their power for their own desires.  The Bad Things: -You are only able to have one save. It autosaves after every night and it prevents you from making backups saves or restarting a day incase you make a mistake.  -Food is extremely scarce and limited. There are only 4 types of food: Vegetables, Raw Meat, Canned Food, and Cooked Meals. There is no existance of Rice, Fish, Bread, or other foods which are commonly found in many places. Some places, like the Military Outpost, Have a lot of food but not enough to keep a group of 4 well fed for a week.  --Water is kind of useless. Nobody drinks water, only Coffee and Alcohol. Water is only used for in making Moonshine, and Cooking Food.  My Score for this game is: 9/10. Many of the bad things were not that bad but some tweaks should be implemented.

In fact, I think its safe to say I usually make the immoral choice because 1) Its a video game and 2) In a lot of games, the immoral choice is often highly rewarded. This is not always the case in 'This War of Mine'. Every decision you make (good or bad) has the potential to bring absolute disaster to you and the rewards are usually no more then a scrap of food, a bandage or maybe some ammunition.  You find yourself confronted with the issue of not only your characters morality, but your own. Setting aside the fact that the game characters can get depressed, this game has a way of making YOU (the player) feel bad for what you've done. The first person I ever killed in this game made me actually stop playing just so I could absorb what happened and how I never wanted it to happen again.  I entered a run down house, it was the first occupied building I had ever looted. I quickly noticed it was inhabited and starting sneaking around, grabbing up all the items not owned by the residents. Realizing the one thing I really needed (food of course) was not among them, I decided it was time to steal. Needless to say, I got caught opening their fridge.  Running into the basement I attempt to leave without a confrontation, only to find I had never unblocked the basement exit and I was now stuck between a locked door, and a guy who wanted to kill me for stealing his food. I did the only thing I could think of and began to smash him with my crowbar. Clicking somewhat madly I didn't notice until it was to late that he was surrendering instead of fighting to the death. To late his cry reachs my ears as my final blow sends him crashing to the floor, followed shortly by his sobbing lady friend. Murderor, she cries, why did you have to kill him? Still in the heat of the moment one thought enters my twisted excuse of a human mind, 'No witnesses'. A moment later she lies next to her fallen lover as I stand over their bodies in triumph before I come to my senses.  O god, what have I done...  Determined to right the wrongs I have commited I decide to try and play as honourably as I can. Never steal from or kill civilians, avoid conflict at all cost and help out at every chance I get.

It seriously busts your balls if you lose your people though for example : Lost my Scavenging guy in two run throughs (haven't finished the game yet, ran out of food twice aswell) and when losing him my resources just ceased to exist.   Recommend this game massively for the atmospheric feeling of impending doom and destruction from the pestilance of life and the common bandits and other surviours in the war torn city..",

That being said, This War of Mine takes the road that many games avoid. What happens to civilians in a warzone? It really is something different and something that is an experience in itself. It has varied gameplay with stealth, combat, scavenging, and helping others. It is up to you how you lead your group to survive until the end of the war.  Also, the DLC for the game goes to a great cause. You get content, and the money goes to help children living in warzones.  It truly is an experience that I would recommend to anyone.

After 5 or so days, Palve died from his wounds and Marko and Bruno were the only ones alive and they kept on going, no matter what. before The Outbreak of Crime, they allowed another war victim to join them a woman named Arica. Her shelter was bombed and needed to find a new home. Marko and Bruno were heavily wounded and yet they allowed her to stay with them.  One day, as Marko and Bruno's condition grew worse and worse, Erica decided to go to the hospital to get something to help them at night, turns out that they don't sell bandages, but they have many doctors that could heal the two friends. As Arica arrived back to the house....... It was all lost.....  The two beds held the bodies of not friends nor enemies..... But the remains of what left Arica......  10/10 would go through this emotional rollercoaster again",

It's one of the only games that has made me feel that way and that is why I love it.   Although I have only played a bit, I feel like I need to write a review.  Pros: 1) This game is a great survival game. It has a really good mechanic on how to survive and the needs of your survivors.  2)The game is awesome when it comes to character development. As you go through the game, You learn more and more about each of your survivors and what they think about the war. The characters also have bonds with each other and share some cool reactions with each other. The Characters have their own little personallity and likings. They each react differently to a decision you wish to make. It can either get them sad or make them content.  3) The Decision making. In this game you had to take alot of rough decesions. You either help someone or you help yourself. It was really hard to choose wether or not I'll give that homeless man my food and give that little girl my meds... I honestly felt horrible when I said no to one of them.  4) The Workshop. Although the story is great and all, People can make their own custom stories witch is a feature I loved. The thought about making my own little survivors and see how they acted was a cool feature.  5) The crafting system. The crafting system was simple and easy to use. Something I liked about it.  6) The game hits your right in the spot. This game is very demmanding as in you'll need to get alot of food and meds because if you don't you have the Risk of your survivors might die. When someone does Die.it makes you feel so bad..... Like if you messed up something really important and now you can't fix it ever.  7) The Art and music were greatly done and it really made you feel happy or sad or exited depending on the situation.   Cons: 1) I don't like the fighting mechanic. It felt really weird. 2) Time goes really fast in the game. Other than these 2 I don't really have a complain.",

'The Little Ones' was a concept for DLC not even made.  No game is ever the same, no copied crap here! NO SIR!  Endless replayability, oooh yeah... again and again and... well you get it. No lag, no glitches or bugs so far in over 35 hours of play!!  Not demanding on any computer type. Not one crash.( We were wearing seatbelts) Polished perfect (every game should be launched when this well done) Terrific Sounds (Better with headset as in every mind scare and make you pee game) Great endless 'choose your own adventure' sandbox Can try again with different groups unlocked as you last longer each time Great graphics and storyline!!  You choose what you do, how, when, who to trust, when and where to go, with a basic easy to learn control system. Epliogue outstanding at game end!!! (each character used, if you survived or died, is based upon them living or death and their contributions during the war)  Wish there were more hours in the day to play but right now there is only... oh...wait... crapola... gotta go... just to come back and play more!!  Tips; You have to build a radio to know whats coming, what happening, and tune it as well.  Dont drink and drive! No seriously.. dont... you could hurt someone we dont like or yourself!  Sh*t we need to dance in war too!! (Make some music to fit your group and lower stress or boredom; perhaps a backrub or some an*l lube. Tune into news to find out about riots and looting and to find out what nights are ok to scavenge and when you should protect your home)  Use of a headset makes the game that much more intense and immersive, and if you fart you can act like you didnt do it! Huh... what... I dont hear nothin!  Try and try again, trial and error is key. (Its also unlocks new characters to try with) The war/game end can happen at any time, some games last 25 days, some last 60, you have to survive till its over so no game is ever the same. (Watch your Epilogue everytime you survive the war) Try different crews, you unlock them as you try and fail.  Get past certain number of days each try and unlock more, or meet them in your journey and unlock them as well. My quickest game was 23 days survived (only once) and my longest was 67 days survived You will always loose people, its part of war and the game, more can join you as you survive!  Dont give up! Dont let their death end in vain and be for nothing! Alone... you can still survive!

This game makes you feel what it's like to scrape by and know the face of dread and even despair. If you want to expierince what the real effects of war are like, this game is for you. The struggle you feel with your characters proved to be the most compelling experience I've ever had in a video game. The game can, eventually, get to the point where you understand it enough to get through most-all scenarios and avoid most of the tragedy, but it took me about 40-50 hours of gameplay to get to that point. I'm guessing most people won't play that much, but you don't have to. The experience of just one playthrough is enough to justify the price. The writing is fantastic, each character keeps a journal affected by the events of the game and how you influenced them. It adds a layer of depth that draws you towards them even more.  As far as cons go, there aren't all that many. There are a few par for the course aspects of the game, things that don't really stnad out that much and maybe could have used a little more work. For example, the combat fits the moods of the game but it feels a bit mediocre in contrast to the quality of the tone of the game. If I really try to stretch and find something wrong with the game, the sound design in the effects could have been improved a bit, like the door knocking and the gunshot sounds, but this is an EXTREMELY minor point and it's not anythign that pulls me out of the game.

The characters are so real it's easy to become attached to them, it's hard to see them make the tough choices. The gameplay is tight, the UI is clear and useful. The other people you run across can be simultaneously familiar and yet coldly distant. Doing the dirty work that must be done to survive is exciting and immersive. You know you're being awful, and don't want to be caught doing it.   Once the effect wears off, and you begin to approach the game from a strictly technical perspective, it becomes quite easy to stay alive. It also becomes fairly simple to plunder every structure you come across and leave none standing to tell the tale. The various story customizations and additional characters and locations to incorporate make the game strongly replayable, but you won't unlearn the important lessons of your earlier attempts.

During the day you need to feed your survivors, keep their mental health sound, and occassionally deal with visitors there to trade or ask for help. At night you send a lone survivor out into the wild, picking a location to scavenge and hope that they don't get caught intruding or stealing. What makes these scavenging missions more interesting is the semi-random nature of what they contain and the encounters that can occur at them, such as witnessing the attempted ♥♥♥♥ of a young girl by a very well armed soldier? Do you let the soldier defile the women in exchange for a free run of the area, or do you risk your survivor by engaging him in combat?

            "review_text": "This will probably get lost in the sea of positive reviews, but I had to add to them. This War of Mine is a great game, and one that's hooked me in solidly for the past two days. On my first playthrough my main scavenger was quickly killed after I tried to prevent a soldier sexually assaulting a civilian. Clearly this game is not shy about throwing you straight in, and this is one of many moments that highlights that the morally correct decision is not necessarily the one that's going to get you through the war. This, combined with overnight bandit raids on my shelter left the remaining survivors wounded and depressed. One died of sickness, and the last one was then driven to suicide by day 14.   At this point I didn't think I'd ever pick the game back up - it was harrowing and felt legitimately futile (intentionally so, I'm sure). However, on a second playthrough you'll most likely get to grips with the game mechanics and start to learn to scavenge and trade effectively, allowing you to build utilities and structural improvements to your shelter. Eventually, you'll even become self sufficient to the point that food is no longer too much of a concern when scavenging. It's not all plain sailing though, as the game progresses you'll need to traverse increaslingly dangerous areas to continue collecting supplies, and you'll face tough choices on whether you can afford to help people. You'll also inevitably be faced with the moral dilemma of whether to steal or not. And you probably will.  I have only a couple of minor negative points to mention about this game. First is that the combat is very unintuitive. Some kind of tutorial system for this aspect is badly needed, given that one wrong move will almost certainly end with your death. Second is that if you do well in the early game, the mid to late game can become a bit of a formality, You'll have all the food and meds that you need and plenty of luxuries to trade, which can result in a 15 or so day period where you're kind of just waiting for it to end. It still manages to be fun, but the variety is gone by this point.  All in all, however, the positives FAR outway any minor drawbacks and I highly recommend giving this engrossing, thought-provoking game a go.",

Pros :  -Lots of survival factors. -Great Atmosphere. -Really fitting OST. -Moral choices that affect your characters moral and will. -Beautiful artistic style (tho this is pretty subjective) -Provides an interesting and different point of view about war.  Cons :  -Can get quite repetitive. -Is moddable, but modding possibilities don't add much to the replayability.  Overall a good game, wich sadly lacks replayablility, as it becomes repetitive after some time.  8.5/10",

Then everything derailed from there, looters kept on coming to loot there little safehouse and injured Marko and Bruno.  After 5 or so days, Palve died from his wounds and Marko and Bruno were the only ones alive and they kept on going, no matter what. before The Outbreak of Crime, they allowed another war victim to join them a woman named Arica. Her shelter was bombed and needed to find a new home. Marko and Bruno were heavily wounded and yet they allowed her to stay with them.  One day, as Marko and Bruno's condition grew worse and worse, Erica decided to go to the hospital to get something to help them at night, turns out that they don't sell bandages, but they have many doctors that could heal the two friends. As Arica arrived back to the house....... It was all lost.....  The two beds held the bodies of not friends nor enemies..... But the remains of what left Arica......  10/10 would go through this emotional rollercoaster again",

I ran through the sniper fire with relative ease, hiding behind an object here and there until I got across the street to the man's residence. When I busted through the door, I heard his baby start to cry. I had to stop for a minute. The fact that there are millions of children out there right now who spend their childhood in this environment dawned on me. Dammit, I wasn't gonna let this kid die because of this senseless war so I unlocked this passageway that was out of the sniper's line of sight so the father could get through safely. He gave his child the medicine and promptly gave me a reward. I didn't really take much as I thought that the child's reunion with his father was reward enough for me. I strolled out of the building feeling like a champ. It didn't last long as time was running out and I foolishly hurried my character to leave the area and head home. What I didn't expect was for my character to run across the street like an idiot til he got shot.",

Each character has a unique skill and personality, with different needs and react differently to different events, which may effect how you can play. (e.i. some characters despise the idea of stealing and killing, while others aren't bothered by it.)

You can play how you like, the 'Karma' at the end of the game doesn't affect the gameplay in any way. You can kill, steal and turn a blind eye to others' plights and survive Post-Apocalypse style... or you could refuse to add to the already piling corpses, try not to let it change you and cling to the humanity that is so easy to tout when things are fine.  It IS just a game, and I hope I'll never be forced to actually make the decisions I had to in my first playthrough.

This game gives you the opportunity to more deeply understand the struggle of survival for these people. 'Should I steal food from this elderly couple, basically gauranteeing their death? What if it means my family and I will live through the winter?' 'Should I try to save a woman being ♥♥♥♥♥ by a soldier, when he has a gun and I am unnarmed, even if it will mean both of our deaths?' These are the l kinds of questions that This War of Mine makes you ask yourself. On the other hand, this game can be so absolutely demoralizing and depressing that you just have to walk away from it.

            "review_text": "I’ve greatly enjoyed my time in this game. I even happened to start playing just as the devs released an anniversary update which added some characters and locations!   This War of Mine infuses story into its very mechanics, and for that it should be (and is) lauded. The immersion ran deep as I was learning the game: a risky attempt at theft would leave a character wounded, with bandages only to be found in dangerous areas. I listened behind a door as a soldier offered a woman food for sex. When she refused, he became violent, but not before I burst through the door and provided egress for the woman, risking my own head as he shot at us both. I had to make the hard choice to rob an elderly couple in their home. The man followed me around but never attacked, just begged me to stop. When I returned a few days later, they had both vanished. I understood that I killed them by raiding their food and medicine stores.  As I played more and became more comfortable with the game, it became easier and the strife seemed less real, even on the hardest difficulty. I never found justification to build an herbal workshop. What’s interesting, though, is that I may have built differently depending on the cast I chose to start with.  That’s because of how much goes into the characters you play as: varying available inventory slots make them better or worse at scavenging, most characters are addicted to a certain product such as coffee or cigs, and each has an ability or special reason to use them. Bruno is a terrible scavenger but a good cook, using less resources to prepare our food. He’s also a sensitive prat and he’s no good at making others feel better. Katia is a reporter who’s expert at trading, rewarding me for bringing the right items to the right people. (a huge early-game bonus can be had for trading meds with the son and his sick father) Pavle’s a fast runner and someone else is very strong, or sneaky; that particular sneaky character makes quick work of a house of hostiles. On the subject, it’s also an optional-violence game, so that’s great to see.  There’s even an option to import pictures and create characters of your own; I recently finished a rewarding run using some of my closest friends.  It will make you feel. It will challenge your mind and show you, in a unique way, what can happen when a civilized community – like yours or mine – goes without food for a month.",

If the answer is still no, then I can honestly not recommend it.  This is the result of my experience with This War of Mine, a game that tries to depict the horrors of war from the point of view of survivors caught in the crossfire. It is an indie title with a very fitting art direction, a good soundtrack reminescent of the first Fallout games, and some interesting crafting mechanics. It's relatively difficult and yours survivors will probably not all make it through the war, with random events such as raids, outbreaks of crime, and the harsh winter.   Despite my successful run, I quicky got bored as the days passed and the game became more of a routine, not to mention I had so many resources that scavenging became more of a chore than a thrilling escapade. Once you become self-sufficient, the game loses a lot of appeal. By the 20th day, I was wondering when the war would end. By the 40th, I was banging my head against a wall and listening to podcasts to keep myself awake.   So in the end, I cannot recommend This War of Mine. It has some undeniable qualities, and someone else might enjoy it far more than me, but in the end it didn't do it for me.",

I feel no emotional connection to any of my characters, which really means I don't ever get the feeling of having to make 'tough decisions' as others have claimed. The bleakness of the games aesthetics do more to depress me about wasting my own life playing a resource management sim, rather than make me empathise with these characters.   Yes it's about how people would normally endure war, much different to most violent games one would otherwise play, but that doesn't necessarily make it fun or even interesting. It does, however, end in an emperor's new clothes style blanket positive reviews, as peoples' minds are blown that it realistically represents how experiencing a war must be, and they feel they must express this. This may be to show off their burgeoning sympathy/empathy, in understanding the suffering of others.

The fact that if you attack once and you fail your opponent remembers is good, the fact that all members of your safe-house are then afterwards persona non grata is just asinine. The others members should still be unknown and trusted, seriously.  So in essence this is just a 'manage your resources' thing since all other options are pretty much a no-go and thus gets repetitive and boring quickly. Managed 45 days before war ended, could've probably lasted double because after a while with enough traps and such the barter and food system more or less sustains one indefinitely?

Repetitive. Thats the whole game.  Now heres me Giving a review with work in it   Starving people get sad that they stole food Oh yes should i mention you are STARVING!?. There is no replay value its just same old same old (just like this review) But with either more supplies less supplies survivors no survivors nice survivors bad survivors but they aren't really...memorable, They all whine they all get sad when stealing food its like switching a flip for a robot 'OH SAD BEEP BOOP SAD ALERT CRY ALERT'  Now let me say some GOOD parts about this game. (Not really)  Now the scavenging is fun at times and with survivors where one action can be your death is quite pressuring and fun at times but thats also where it loses it self at one point, Where one action can be your death is determined by some numbers, Yes if you have less gear you should be able to have some luck in it since it wont get stale but when you have the advantage like stabbing them in the back with a hatchet something that will either kill them or put them near death they some how counter it with out them knowing about you   Day: Now the building can be fun there is also reasons to get some stuff like a stove or a workbench or a radio or beds! But the thing is there isn't much to do really except Trade talk to survivors work thats it for lets say...40 Days which is like 12 hours? Anyways when you do those 'Side Quests' its just the press of a button and theres no real risk to it unless you have to guard or something like...You don't play that scene (Which would be cool but of course its not there) Now for maybe a sale of 2 dollars probably even less you should maybe pick it up but 15 dollars? No its DULL like a rusty blade. Anyways if they some how get you with the guilt factor to 'BUY THIS GAME 2 GIVE 2 CHARITY' You would be SO much better giving to a real charity since they take a cut of the money.  Also building has the same building animations for every BUILDING  you cant make like sandbags or like a defence and you can't even defend from raids its so many wasted good moments in my opinion that could of been used to make it better Hell i would probably want like a raid survival thing where you need to survive against the raids against you but you can't die from it easily kinda thing or a mode where you have to survive against harder and harder waves until you die or you like run out of supplies. Better off pirating it and giving 5 dollars to charity!   Also you can only be a civilian theres no extra modes or anything just trying to survive like that You can't raid other people (well in some cases you can) you can't be like a marine or something you can't be a blood thirsty bandit on the streets just looking for blood, Yes you could kinda act like those but, Your guys don't change at all. They don't like...Hardened after killing some more they just keep crying even if you TRY to kill everyone! And your guys don't get more dark or get 'happy' when they kill its only sadness and... Unless your deppresed being sad is just a word in this except for them just saying some weird wacky SAAAD stuuffff...There is no emotion. None There is not really hard choices like, Do i kill them and lose my humanity? Or starve but still be a good person? Like you don't kill a TON so your guys dont run out Theres no choice, Theres no emotion, They aren't special, but you know what they are?

Only one person can be sent out to scavenge every night, and since the inventory space is very low you have to repeatadely come to the same place for like 5 times. 2. No skip button - when in day phase there's no way to speed up the time, so you have to wait for 2-5 minutes aimlessly until your vegetables finish growing, or you collect the water you need, or while your characters sit in a talking animation. This happens every single day and again, makes the game boring. 3. Saving is only done at the beginning of each day. Meaning, if you make a mistake, guess what, you have to sit through the entire day again, and watch your characters comfort each other for 5 minutes.

In this game you scavenge, make decision, and everything will have a consequence. You actually mmight feel guilty about your way of survival if you robbed unarmed people, and I guess this is the point the game wants to deliver to the players.  However no matter you want to play the game in a peaceful way or the other, you will need to figure out what barrier in different locations and what kind of enemies are guarding there, so you could survive. Otherwise, you won't be able to make it after a few runs.  Because this game is SUPER NOT BALANCED.  You get so little from scarvange, and you characters are so fragile they easily get sick or wounded, especially boundage and madicine are such of high price, most of the time you barely have any of them. So after a few runs I began to think it is designed to let you make some ungodly move. You also won't be able to trade enough for what are considered to be essential, food, is another good example, let alone for guitar or other entarimentment stuff. Occasionally you got lucky to earn a gun, but you run out of ammo so quick and it's even not the beginning of winter, when you got robbed more often during the night.  Did I mention you also need to feed empty bellies, and how hard it is just to get enough food? I don't often play survival games, but I've been playing video games since I was a kid. This is not supposed to be the way of a good game design. It is a good idea to let poeple experience the hard life of refugees, but as a conmertial game, shouldn't entertain players be more important?  Intersting so many people rate is positive.

            "review_text": "I'm going to have to join the minority here and say that I rather disliked the game overall.  Storywise, I found it very underwhelming compared to what was advertised. The game simply does not provide an atmosphere that is conducive for the player to form emotional attachments to the characters - we see very little character development aside from a handful of short text blurbs. In-game interactions are fairly basic - they feel hungry when not fed, get sick when they are cold, feel tired when they do not sleep, and become depressed when they commit murder (oddly, as far as I remember, characters do not have a similar reaction when stealing from innocents). After the novelty of the game wears off, these interactions tend to feel sterile, reptitive, and predictable. In essence, the player never really gets to know the characters, and as a result there is nowhere for the advertised empathy to take root. I still feel like I'm playing a video game, rather than interacting with a game universe - ie, I would not feel bad when I have Boris murder a handful of people in cold blood for their loot, because those 'people' are faceless NPCs who do not have moral value. Boris will feel depressed afterwards, but 'depression' is something that can be cured with a couple clicks and some time, and he'll be right back to the status quo within a night or two and ready to kill faceless NPCs again. And this cycle repeats endlessly until the end of the war, with the only long-term consequence being a different blurb of text at the end of the game (characters get better or worse epilogues depending on whether you have them spend time being nice to people or murdering them). Occasionally, the game will attempt to give an NPC a face (many of the non-faceless NPCs are already dead by the time you arrive on the scene), but the interactions in the game are always too short and non-interactive to provide much of an impact. Why should I care about the life of that person in the semi-abandoned house? She's shooting at me, video game logic dictates that I kill her. That is the sum of her character, and that does not change simply because another NPC runs over and starts crying over her corpse. Am I supposed to care simply because I see an animation that resembles someone feeling sad? As far as I remember, she isn't even given a name, ingame (she is named on the wiki, though). Both she and the helpless civilian mourning her death lack the complexity needed to provoke a thoughtful or sympathetic reaction from the player. They don't feel like they're actual people, especially after you've seen the exact same scene multiple times.  I also find that the emotional impact gets buried under the slow and reptitive gameplay. I found that, at first, I was too busy trying to learn the game and survive to care much about the NPCs I encountered ('oh, there's a man caring for his elderly parents... hey, look, duct tape! Exactly what I needed to progress through the game!'). By the time I learned the game, it felt routine enough that stealing from and killing the NPCs was simply part of a game ('What, you're caring for your elderly parents? Meh, seen it 27 times. Hand over the carrots.'). Similarly, as I got more familiar with the game, the limited AI in the game made many of the NPCs less believable. Logically, if I walk into the military base with an assault rifle, a hatchet, and heavy body armor and blow/chop the heads off half the soldiers stationed at the facility (not hard to do once you've learned the levels and the combat mechanics), and then retreat into the night before the timer reaches daylight, the remaining soldiers SHOULD have some sort of reaction by the time I return the next night. But no, they don't even alter their patrols. They keep walking in the same patterns as they always did, completely ignoring the murder of their comrades and the gaping hole in their front gate's defenses.  I also find it rather unsatisfying how little we're told about the war itself. We know that there's a war, and it's bad for the civilians (like any war), and this is somehow supposed to be enough. It isn't enough, because it doesn't feel believable and it's not an engaging story. Why is this war being fought? Who is fighting it, and what do they stand for? The game rarely gives the player relevant information about what's going on, even when doing so would greatly help the immersion of the game (for instance, if you visit the rebel-occupied school, why don't the rebels take the opportunity to give you some propaganda pamphlets to read? Why doesn't the government try to drum up patriotism if you visit the military base?).  Are these rebels revolutionary freedom fighters overthrowing an oppressive government, or are they reactionary terrorists? The message of the game seems to be that it does not matter, and we should focus on the plight of noncombatants because feelings. Such a sentiment can only preserve the status quo (as wars happen because of attempts to disrupt the status quo), which may well do more long-term harm to the civilians than the war - we don't know, because we aren't told what the status quo is or why the war is being fought. Maybe the pre-war government was democratic and defend human rights, or maybe it was tyrannical and oppressive. Maybe the rebels are really trying to help the people, or maybe they're bloodthirsty thugs trying to instill fear. Maybe neither side is so clear-cut. Instead of developing this interesting storyline, the game chooses to focus on meaningless appeals to emotion which usually don't stir up the intended emotion and over-dramatic short stories that usually come across as pieces of a story rather than a finished story. For example, why should we care whether Katia publishes her journal or burns it? We never knew her in the first place. We don't even know most of what's going into the journal. 'She' was never anything more than a photograph and a few sentences of text, and these were not enough to create an emotional connection between her and the player. It is almost as if the entire point of the game was to anviliciously try to portray war as fundamentally pointless and gruesome and assert that the only meaningful things are the lives that are damaged by it, but the game fails in demonstrating these because the pointlessness is only brought about by mediocre storytelling and the gruesomeness isn't adequately conveyed in-game, and nor do the lives feel meaningful.   It's an ok game, in terms of gameplay, but gets old fairly quickly. The days in particular often have periods in which you are not doing anything but waiting for something to happen or be built - this is especially the case if you're new to the game and don't have a specific plan laid out in advance with regards to what you need to do and what you need to do it. Gathering enough resources, particularly food, is difficult at first (especially if you want to survive without stealing), but it gets easier over time. and scavenging quickly starts to feel dull and reptitive. It's also not particularly difficult once you get rolling - if you're efficient about your looting and resource management, you'll probably have enough resources to go around for most of the game. Combat is difficult at first, but becomes much easier once you learn the mechanics and even easier once you loot some high-quality gear (the key is to have someone good in melee combat use a hiding place and stab someone in the back with a knife or hatchet as they're walking by. If they have allies, they'll sprint towards the scene, but you can usually step right back into the hiding place and do the exact same thing with them too. The NPCs are stupid enough that these kinds of tactics can be used to clear out entire areas, with the only real danger coming from situations in which you're either caught unprepared or have to fight multiple NPCs at once.).",

If you are that kind of gamer, and I have absolutely nothing against you if you are, then I whole heartedly recommend This War of Mine and am confident that it will be one of the best games you have played recently.  However, if you're used to big name games and have a lot of experience with strategy/management/base building/economic games then, like me, you will probably find TWoM somewhat underwhelming, often frustrating and all too predictable. The first 15minutes seemed brimming with potential, but after about half an hour I realised that I'd seen and done this all before and there wasn't anything new on offer.  Most of the game is spent staring at the screen, listening to your characters complain that they're hungry or tired or don't feel well or don't have [tool] or wish they still had basic luxuries. A lot of people seemed to find this endearing and heartbreaking, but for me it quickly got annoying. You're in a war zone! I don't care if you'd sleep better if I built you a real bed; suck it up! Between the waiting around, it's fairly repetitive. You spend the day building things with materials you found during the night. That's basically it. If you use all your materials, you can skip forward to the night section, but risk missing out on traders or other survivors visiting you if you do.  The night time looting really should have been the highlight of this game, and in many ways it is, but some odd design choices spoil the fun. For a game which prides itself on generating a more realistic wartime experience, I found the fact that a cigarette apparently uses as much backpack space as two planks of wood slightly confusing. TWoM uses the classic 'box inventory' system, where individual items have their own inventory space and stack to a limited number when you pick up an item of the same type. This works for some games, but because of the variety of items you can find, TWoM should probably have gone with a weight system instead - the frustration of having to decide between a single pouch of tobacco or ten bottles of water because I didn't want to drop four vegetables very quickly wore thin.  Add to this, that you can only visit ONE place, ONCE, PER NIGHT, even if you only spent an hour looting and still have six hours of darkness, and the whole looting process becomes exacerbating. Especially when you then have to sit around listening to your guys moaning all day, even though their problems would be solved if they could bothered to loot a place twice in an evening.   For a low budget indie game, TWoM is fantastic. This goes doubly so if you're impressed by 2D games with pencil effect shading, and triply so if you've never spent more than £20 on a game. I don't mean that in a derisory way, I'm just trying to manage expectations.  However, I found it to be overall repetitive, frustrating and, ultimately, not nearly as original as it likes to think it is. Experienced gamers will be able to predict most aspects of this game without requiring a lengthy play through. If you want a really gruelling resource management/suspense &amp; strategy/tough decisions game experience then I’d recommend XCOM on a harder difficulty and/or with the Long War mod over this.",

Game is just one big message of 'War is bad! Have good morals!' which is something I normally agree with. But this game would actually be worth money if they would have at least acknowledged the 'bandit' argument. Instead of all the bandits being 80 I.Q. rapists. Like seriously? are you that close minded? 4. No replay value. After you beat it once you got the full package. You can play again with slightly different places and people but in the end it changes nothing. I beat it in 2-ish hours. 5. No strategic value and relies heavily on luck (unless you google everything). 6. One-dimensional characters. No one actually brings up anything intelligent. Nor does the game put you in thought provoking or controversial situations. The best it had was a soldier ♥♥♥♥♥♥ a woman and you can't stop him because he has an AK-47 and you have a knife. As mentioned above combat is ♥♥♥ so there is no possible way you can beat him through 'skill'. You never get attached to the characters so when they die you're more of '♥♥♥♥♥♥♥it I wasted so much supply on keeping this pig alive' instead of 'Anton died? Oh god... '.  7. The text that tells you what effects your people have (important information) can't be adjusted. So if you can't read it, tough ♥♥♥♥ bud. 8. Has DLC. Lol. 9. Anyone who tells you the game is realistic is smoking some good ♥♥♥♥. You don't die from guns very fast/You never die to random mortor fire/Houses and Buildings never get destroyed throughout the 40 day period (or however long you set it). You can never switch houses. You can't carry multiple backpacks or send multiple people out to scavenge. ♥♥♥♥ers get very hungry in one day and die from hunger in 3-4. Someone has never went without food for more than a day. Also no sneak attacks. You can't ride up on a bandit and slice his neck. 10. The things it does simulate are just annoying. People can never be cured of illness, if they have a gun and you don't you're boned. The characters get sad over EVERYTHING. 'I couldn't give that kid medicine, I'm a monster!' ♥♥♥♥♥ we didn't have medicine, let your balls drop and get over it. They don't ever cheer up either.  11. YOU CAN'T SEND MORE THAN ONE PERSON TO SCAVENGE. 12. ^ 13. Guitars are actually the most useless thing on the planet. I spent SO MUCH supply on building a guitar and chairs around it. Just so I could make them sit around the listen to the chick play, with them cheering up. IT DID NOTHING. 14. Easy way to win. Crank out as many small animal traps as you can, because rats are infinite. They make up the space between particles they're so ♥♥♥♥ing numerous. (It's a joke don't bust my balls chemists)",

Ok, so, this is a tricky review to write because i'm not a completely sociopathic person and i do understand human suffering and that war is a terrible thing. But that's rather the point, i do know that already and i wanted a game not a never-ending stream of 'War is bad mmmm-Kay' with - and this is the main point of this rant - very little game attached.  Daytime - there is essentially feck all to do in this section of the game. 2 minutes of cooking and eating and maybe build a thing, and then you have to sit through the rest of the day so all of your little dudes/dudettes can have a go at sleeping. Because there's no way to queue actions and no fast forward time button. And no way to check what materials something needs without one of your very very slow little people walking to the damn workbench to look. And why the heck can't i upgrade the damn stove just because there's a pot of food sitting on it? Just move it to the damn fridge little man... And if you do make a lovely, well-equipped house for the little people are they happy? No, it's 'a brief respite from the horrors that surround us' because god forbid there might be a second where we aren't reminded that War is Bad.  So we come to Nighttime - that's gonna be more fun, we'll be sneaking about on perilous, action-packed escapades! Oh. For starters, it won't be 'we' because for some completely non-explained reason no matter how desperate we are for resources only one of my little people is allowed out at night. The others will sit on their arses and whine about being hungry and even starve and still a second person may never leave. Presumably something to do with War being Bad. But ok. at least my one little dude who is a 'Skilled Scavenger' will do something exciting! Hmm, well, actually it turns out i don't have a sawblade so i can't get in to the room with the shiny stuff (apparently my 'Skilled Scavenger' can't just use that pile of metal scrap that's right there to knock a hole in the wall of the completely abandoned. shelled house) - guess i'll go clear this rubble so i can get at that interesting looking cupboard. Oh Christ. I'm going to have to sit and watch him spend most of the night scraping some rocks. Because there's no fast forward time button. I guess if there was I might not have as much time to sit and think about how War is Bad.  And a final note on that, you know one of the ways that people deal with War being Bad? Humour. And there is not a drop of it to be found in this game anywhere.  So is there anything good about this game? Yes. The artwork is awesome, it's certainly atmospheric (if rather one-dimensionally so), and it is in a strange way somewhat compelling - otherwise i wouldn't have spent so many hours on a very annoying game. Unfortunately, none of that can make up for gameplay and interface being borderline terrible.",

But in the end it's basically an exercise in futility, and not because of any challenge it presents, but because of bad design.  Bear with me. The game opens with zero tutorial or information or anything. The only thing your survivors have are the clothes on their backs and some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ apartment-type place that can be fixed up and made liveable with a little work. Unfortunately, you have no idea how to get people working on making it liveable. For example; to undo rubble, you basically need a shovel, which you need a metal working station to create. And if you spend all the resources you collected from easy locations on say, improving your workbench, because you have no idea what that means? Go ♥♥♥♥ yourself, You've effectively lost, or at least put yourself in an extremely disadvantageous position.  Still though, a quick playthrough of three days or so is effectively a tutorial. Most things are fairly quickly learned (which makes the lack of even an optional tutorial twice as infuriating, because everything COULD be explained in ten minutes.)  Eventually though, things settle down. And this side of the game, where you manage limited resources in order to try to see to the needs of your own survivors and friendly neighbours is actually really fun once you get into it. This is why I tried to like the game.  But then come the night sections.  The night sections.  No matter how many people you have, you can only send one of your crew to loot a location at once. Your base is secure as it ever will be, and you know a good place for materials but need an extra hand to carry even half of them? Go ♥♥♥♥ yourself. You want to risk an attack on a small survivor compound? Well, have fun assaulting it alone.  But even this I could understand, really, from a game balance point of view. Would be a bit against the message if you and your team of commandos just ran in everywhere and slaughtered everyone for all their things.  What really gets me is that you will inevitably need to steal or shoot your way to more resources. And I mean inevitably, because even ♥♥♥♥ like making a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ axe will cost you half a forest's worth of wood. And when you go to do this, you will find the game's AI, combat, and stealth systems are all abominable.  We'll start with the AI. You never know what might set them off. Going upstairs in a bordello? Suddenly everyone's after your blood, and they'll demand that you leave dozens of times while BLOCKING THE ONLY EXIT. Open a locked locker, because nobody had a problem with you looting a chest right next to it? Oh well, turns out someone does actually own this locker and of course he has an assault rifle because EVERYBODY DOES. He also, OF COURSE, has exactly enough bullets to shoot forever and leave two on his corpse.  Now let's move into combat. You sneak up behind someone to try and knife them in the neck? You'd better make sure you're RIGHT BEHIND THEM before clicking to attack, because God forbid you have any foresight. Otherwise it doesn't count as a sneak attack. And even if you do pull off a sneak attack, odds are pretty good that whomever you're fighting will whip out a weapon, take practically no damage, and then proceed to pummel you to death. Even if they don't have a weapon, they'll pummel you with their bare hobo-hands for vastly more damage than you manage when smacking someone from behind with a ♥♥♥♥ing axe. While their fifty friends with guns come pouring out to murder you even quicker, because EVERYONE HAS GUNS. Except you. You probably only have one or two guns between your three-four survivors.  But everyone else has guns.  Also, if you see someone cowering and begging for their life, but consider them too evil/too much of a risk to let live? Well you better hope you have a gun/ammo, because smacking an unarmed man who's on his knees and covering his head with his hands with a fire axe just doesn't do anything. He'll leap to his feet unharmed like some kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Serbian ninja and judo-chop you to death in two blows.  But now let's move into stealth. Let's say the god's smile on you. You actually manage to stealth kill someone by knifing them in the neck, somehow bypassing the mystical Serbian immunity to cut throats. You will then body-slam this person to the ground so loudly that for all intents and purpose you trigger an earthquake that sends some kind of radio pulse to the stars, broadcasting to alien life your exact name, the name of everyone in your group, who you just killed, and where you just killed them. And also to every NPC in a ten mile radius.  Because stealth.  Tldr: There's a really fun resource management part of the game. It's like a depressing Sims. Then there's the ♥♥♥♥♥iest combat/stealth system ever, and AI that makes Mr Bean look like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mastermind, and you WILL have to do combat/stealth to win.",

For me, I'd only absolutely recommend a game that I think is 9/10 or 10/10.  Just some clarification on my game time. Honestly I played through the pirate version of v1.1 at least 5 times before, unlocked single team member (Markov) start, so that's pretty much everything. I only bought this game to show support.   This game is just another survival game with a war theme. Yes previously the survival games have more of zombie/adventure type theme and this game is unique. It shed light on the ethics of war from a commoner's perspective. This is great and the developers was able to dig a lot into it. However, this game is far from finished and is kind of buggy, which affects the story-telling aspect of the game.  Sometimes the player get shot for no good reason. For example, in the semi-attached house map, the player start from the right buildin. An armed lady who is always looking at the center of the map(without distraction, of course) will shoot the player if he/she does not walk away as the lady says. However, in the left building, out of the range of that armed lady, a scavenger will tell you to watch out for that crazy lady. I suppose the player is intented to start this map from the left side, not from the right side where the crazy lady is, since starting from the right will cause the player inevitablely meet that lady before getting warned.  The close combat in this game appears unfinished as well. I've played this game for weeks and survived at least five times. In three of my walkthroughs, I killed everyone on the map. However, even being a pro at killing in this game, I still sometimes find it impossible to win a close combat. For example, saving that girl from supermarket. Only 1 out of 4 times can I backstab the soldier successfully. The distance is hard to master. Either I was too far that the attack changed into a gunshot, or the soldier somehow 'notice' me when I was about to backstab. The latter case happens a lot when I do the backstab without hiding in a hide point. The enemy almost always notice me and it turns into a face-to-face fight. The worse thing is the enemy often hit you constantly in a close combat and you can't even hit him once. So odd, so annoying.  The moral system has some problem as well. In my last walkthrough, I did not do anything bad beside killing a bunch of bandits who attached me on sight. I also had all my four team memebers 'well-fed' and content everyday in the final 10 days. However, I somehow still got the bad end for Pavle.(who killed the bandits) Pavle wrote all positive things in his diary but still, BAD END. However, in an earlier save, I had good end for all four characters even if some of them stole the garage and clearnse the military post. How strange is that.  In addition, this game appears to be adding big changes in the upcoming updates. Big changes are good, but those changes (such as the change in 1.2.0) even somehow change the game mechanism. In other words, the current version of this game is more like those 'early access game' with a lot of further gameplay improvement and bug fixes to add. Then why the developers not just say this is a unfinished version? This is gameplay changes I'm talking about, not just bug fixes or graphic improvements.  Lack of a fast-forward button is annoying as well. For most of the in-game days I have to sit there and wait until 10 AM to see if someone will show up. When you get familiar with this game, you will find the latter half of this game extremely boring, just repeat and repeat the same ♥♥♥♥ every day - and you have to waste at least 15 minutes real life time per in-game day for waiting for all the building, crafting and waiting for potential visitors.   7/10 for picking a good theme but failing on user experience. Will recomend if a lot of improvement is made.",

But guess what, its a game. so there should be fun in there some where. Its too hard to make the better tools, equipment and weapons. The whole raiding thing is pain in the ♥♥♥. You get meds for a critically ill survivor then it gets stolen. like eff you.   Theres no tutorial, so i cant help it if i dont know what to build or use or trade.

            "review_text": "(this review is meant for the recreational gamer, like me) It is definitely an interesting game. A couple of the most popular reviews that I read are accurate. This game is meant to be difficult and unforgiving (which is why I dont recommend it). The concept of a town beseiged with rebels, military, bandits, those others trying to survive is a difficult situation (which is why the game is hard). Difficulties of the game that dont make it enjoyable:  -You are allowed only one scavenger at night (hard to get decent amount of resources, and nearly impossible to take on more than one enemy). -Depending on how your world spawns, certain material that is essental to survival will be very difficult to find (either bullets, bandages, food, something will be scarce). -The way NPC's move around make it very difficult to get to the good loot in a place. If your caught, you will prob be shot, possibly die. -At some point the safe places to loot wil dry up (the world spawns with a descrete amount of resources, once taken it's gone) leaving only places that have threats but really good loot available (like 'huge amount of food, or meds, or parts') The prob with these places are there are two 'halves' of a map, the first half has crap loot, and the second half has the good stuff with a handful of enemy's making rounds (then the above point comes into play). -Some NPC's can one hit kill from a different floor throught a stairwell as your character is full speed running across. -The trading system is not meant to be a serious part getting resources, just a last ditch effort for something you really need. For example a trader will not trade one bullet for one bullet, you must give up two bullets for his one bullet. This was done with a character that had strength in trading.  Basically, for the recreational gamer, this game badly needs a difficulty setting. For those like me that play recreationally, when we play we expect to have a good time (not a time of constantly being frustrated, and annoyed) and to make progess. This game is good for those who dont mind playing hours on end trying different things just to see if it gets you a little farther. For those like me you need a game that give success without having to play 20+ times over (which takes the game from interesting to montonous) pass this one up, even though it looks really interesting.",
