    "description": "NightCry is set on a cruise ship, and you have been invited along for the cruise of a (possibly short) lifetime. While your surroundings are luxurious and the guests are friendly, not everything is as it should be. The guests and the crew start to turn up dead, the victims of some foul murderer.",

            "review_text": "Note: I have only reached chapter 2.  For the most part the game is good. The graphics are okay, but not cutting edge. The voice acting is good. The controls can be a little difficult to deal with at first, but you'll ween yourself into them after walking around for a few minutes.   The game does not tell you the controls, as far as my experience goes, so you'll need to teach yourself before getting to the first chapter (technically you start in the prologue). Once the first chapter starts, the game will give you instructions on how to move and interact while being chased. The game does not point you in any directions other than through interacting with objects or dialogue during cutscenes, so pay attention and attempt to not skip any details.  There is no menu in the game, or at least I couldn't figure out which key opened the menu. You can pause the game by using the P key. You can skip cutscenes by using the SPACEBAR. The inventory becomes available as you find items. The only real flaw with the exclusion of a menu is that there is no way to escape the game, even from the main menu. If you are in window mode you can just close the window, but if you are in full screen mode, you either have to Tab+Alt out of the game and close it, or Alt+F4.  The only bug I've encountered is during a struggle with the main enemy of the game. You have to click a button quickly in order to push off your pursuer, however, if an object that is interactable is behind that button, your character will interact with it and die immediately afterwords. For example, this bug occured while in room 301, in the bedroom, where I got cornered and somehow interacted with the bed while fighting off the Scissorwalker. There may be other bugs, I do not know yet.  There seems to be a graphical issue with the main character's hair and the lighting that causes FPS to drop. This may not occur for everyone, as I did not experience this issue, however, some people I know, and some in the community are reporting this issue.  The story is suspensful as it sets up multiple suspects to being the Scissorwalker (my money is on grandma in the elevator). The gameplay is very similar to it's predecessors of the Clock Tower franchise: running from an unkillable enemy, hiding, and solving puzzles. The horror is strong in this game as well. Fighting off the Scissorwalker sometimes becomes necessary, but it will quickly drain your stamina and eventually kill you. Even with full stamina, you can still fall to the floor and end up spending your extra stamina picking yourself back up. If you fall and have no stamina, you're likely to die. Sometimes you have to solve a puzzle while the Scissorwalker is chasing you, and sometimes you have to interact with a 'difficult to click on' object. The Scissorwalker's name is also ironic, considering it's walking speed is that of your running speed, and it can occasionally run after you to close any large gaps you may have made between it and yourself.  Hopefully, in a future patch, we can see at least some of these issues dealt with.  EDIT: I forgot to mention three things. 1.) You auto save during checkpoints, but you can manually save using a 'phone charger.' You get access to your phone later in the game, which gives you a light, and allows you to communicate with your friends, or at least the ones still alive. 2.) The history section of the main menu displays all the outcomes of important choices you made, and you can see the path you've taken in the save menu. 3.) When hiding, a heart will be displayed. The game does not mention what it's used for, but you must keep the heart as centered as possible to keep yourself from being discovered by the Scissorwalker. Some hiding spots will not always display the heart, which means the Scissorwalker will ignore those spots.",

            "review_text": "Second attempt, first review deleted, game completed. So I am one of those who have seen the end, now I can judge. ;-) I do prefer the non-mainstream indie, obscure, weird and “unpolished” sort of (horror) games. That’s what you get.   NightCry is an old school, third person horror point and click action adventure with clunky controls and animations. (In line with the “Clock Tower &amp; Resident Evil” series.) But this is part of the game design and art style.   Checkpoint and save game feature is surprisingly well designed, so it’s less frustrating to start over, after you messed up. (Game Over/Dead End screen is your best friend…;-)) Your objectives are not always clear outlined and the sometimes illogical puzzles can be challenging. There are still (non-game-breaking) bugs (missing mouse over markers) that make life hard for you to proceed. The 3 (very diverse) chapters are split into sub-scenes and lead into many different endings. The game builds up a terrifying and dense atmosphere, accompanied by an interesting plot.   So at the end it was really fun to play and a clear recommendation.",

            "review_text": "If you were a fan of the first two Clock Tower games on the SNES and PS1, this game is for you.  No other game came close to the scares from the PS1 Clock Tower game. The odd characters, the strange and mysterious storyline, the creepy atmosphere and Scissorman, I can still remember what he sounds like dragging his scissors across the floor.  A lot of that carries over to Night Cry. It feels like a spiritual successor to Clock Tower.  Some of the same gameplay and technical issues from the Clock Tower series carry over. The camera can get in the way at times. When you're being chased by a killer, it can be difficult to make your character act quick and do exactly what you want without dying. But that's the nature of the game: die over and over until you solve the puzzle. That's also what makes the game great, because the death sequences are awesome to watch. You'll want to go back and unlock all of them.  One downside is that I felt like the game left me wanting more. There's a lot to the story that isn't really explained. I would've liked more levels and more diversity in the level design.  Hopefully we get a sequel in the future, because I would love more horror adventures from the developers.",

            "review_text": "NightCry is an ode to Japanese games from the 90s, badly translated, full of bugs and inconsistency. To when games were made with close to no budget, by small teams, with very basic and simple concepts. It's an ode to when games had a soul. To the   PSX   era, and of course to the   Clock tower   serie.    What you should   NOT   expect from this game:   - fancy graphics. Lot of assets reuse and blurry textures. It's pretty much an upscaled phone game. - good level design. Long, very, very long corridors. No landmarks at all in any area. No way to tell any room apart from each other's. - good voice over. No. It's not very good. And sometimes it's pretty awful. But in a weird twisted way, it reminds me of when they realized they could put VO on PSX games due to the copious disc space and started translating Japanese games (or at least they tried). Odd pause in the middle of a sentence and inappropriate tone of voice. - and of course, don't expect any kind of logic. You won't find any. At all. David Lynch and Jean-Luc Godard would be proud.  And this is why this game and the Clock tower serie (  and quite frankly, pretty much every game from the early PSX era  )has such a weird and eerie athmosphere.    This game is   for you   if:   - you are nostalgic of the PSX. - you have played the Clock tower serie and enjoyed the experience (come on guys, the delicious awkwardness of the Clock tower intro in english is unparallelled!) - you have played Deadly premonition and are saving money just in case they make a sequel (That's A Damn Good Cup of Coffee) - You know and love games like OverBlood, Aconcagua, Echo nights, Twilight Syndrome, Yuuyami Doori Tankentai",

            "review_text": "After playing around 12 hours of the game, getting all but two endings (got the best ending), and seeing a majority of the content, I'd say I'm ready to give my opinion of this game.  I came into this wanting a new Clock Tower game. Not in the likes of some odd magical girl fantasy or weird fetish horror like Haunting Ground/Demento. No, I wanted to relive the experience I had being chased and tormented by a sinister creature wielding a giant pair of scissors. And this game delivers in that aspect.  In the first chapter, I was taken right back to when I played the original games as a kid. Too nervous to look around, afraid any noise would attract the Scissorwalker's attention, and went through things quickly just to avoid encountering that thing. (Ended up getting a bad ending as a result. lol)  Admittedly, the fear diminished a bit when I soon learned in the third chapter the Scissorwalker more utilizes the formula of the First Fear. That being, she only appears in certain areas upon examining things as the way Bobby (first Scissorman) worked.  Even so, don't think you can just avoid her. Unlike being able to go all of First Fear without ever encountering Bobby (other than the beginning and until the end of the game anyway), there are certain areas and items you will be required to investigate that can bring her to you. While it is slightly disappointing the Scissorwalker is more scripted, it does encourage exploration, and daring you to take chances. I can say that even though I felt a little at ease knowing the Scissorwalker doesn't show up at random, I did still get nervous and a little freaked in some places, and especially when I did need to escape her.  The Clock Tower series never really had any great stories. Using a basic plot just to get the horror show going. You're a young girl who under unfortunate circumstances ended up in the clutches of the Scissorman and now must survive and escape. NightCry is a continuation of this basic premise.  The three main characters you get are two college girls, Monica Flores and Rooney Simpson, and their Professor, Leonard Cosgrove, who were boarding a cruise liner called the 'Oceanus'. You start as Monica, whose goal is to hopefully meet a rich man and fall in love (don't get the wrong idea, there's more to it than what you may think), then switches over to Leonard who is a cultural anthropologist and a very eccentric man, and finally the melancholic and withdrawn outcast Rooney. All three have their own chapters and offer different point of views of going about this nightmare, all helping to tie things together in the last act.  The lack of ambience is a little bit of a turn-off for some, and I guess I understand why. But in my opinion, the music more than makes up for it. The soundtrack is gorgeous, delivering a creepy, tension-heightening sound that makes you not want to see what could be around the corner. It's some of the best horror music I've heard since the Silent Hill series, some of my favorite tracks being 'Close Behind', 'Voyager', 'The Cave', 'The Cult', and many others. The only thing that disappointed me about the OST was the Scissorwalker's theme. It starts out with a scare chord, but then goes kind of mellow and slow. Maybe it's nostalgia talking, but I always enjoyed the fast paced theme of the Scissorman, 'Don't Cry Jennifer'. Nonetheless, the OST as a whole still does its job of creating a great atmosphere.  Some of the deaths and gore may be considered over-the-top, but that's always been how the Clock Tower series rolled. I, for one, loved them to pieces. They can get comical to creative to disturbing. One scene in particular comes to mind where something awful happens to a very unfortunate character that was really messed up. But it certainly added to the horror of what these people involved with the Scissorwalker are up to.  Now, having said all of this, the game isn't perfect. In fact, it suffers a lot of flaws that I can see many turning their nose up at it for.  *The graphics. They're not that bad to me, however, I know people of today love their pretty graphics and when you compare NightCry to the appearance of say Until Dawn, it certainly looks ugly. Not helped that it tends to shift. There're times they look passable, to uncanny valley.  *The animations. I will say, this is one of the more disappointing aspects. The animations sometimes are done well enough, but other times so sloppy I wonder how it was deemed 'ready'. Sometimes the lips don't even move, and while I got over it, I can't blame anyone who finds it jarring.  *The voice acting. Now, in my opinion about 90% of the voice acting was fine by me. Monica, Leonard and Jerome all got decent voices, but Rooney's was the big let-down. She sometimes overacts, and sometimes barely acts, making Rooney's important scenes rather cheesy. Fortunately, there is an option to switch it to the Japanese track if you can't bear the English track. I will say though, I wasn't fond of all the Jp voices either, personally. (But at least Rooney got a better portrayal.)  *The story. I mentioned earlier that the Clock Tower series's stories were nothing to write home about, and NightCry isn't doing much else either. The basic premise is all right (murder on board a ship, try to survive it, you are winner), but it's kind of not fleshed out. It seems to prefer to be a little too vague. There are some largely unexplained parts of the plot that may require you to do some extra investigating and theorizing after. Now, I just came off the game, so a replay may be in order to piece it together. But for now, I got to mark against it that it almost feels 'incomplete' at times.  *Jank, camera, and controls. This game is quite unpolished. It uses the old-style point and click that the older Clock Tower games did. For me, I was quickly able to adapt and understand the controls, but I know this won't be the case for everyone else. The camera angles can be a bit awkward as well, causing you to struggle between it and getting the hang of the controls, especially when the Scissorwalker is chasing you. Like I said, I was able to adapt after a bit, but I realize this may be a turn-off for others. And there were times I did fumble with it as well.  *Bugs and glitches. As many people have reported, this game has a lot of bugs. Fortunately, none that really broke the game. Often closing and reopening the game fixed the problem, but it does tend to take away from the experience. The most jarring examples being that sometimes the music and/or sound effects cut out. However, the development team, from what I understand, is hard at work to patch all this up. So hopefully this will remedy the problem. It's barely two weeks old, so it kinda comes with the territory.  Despite naming these flaws and, admittedly, I wish this game could have been more than what it is, I still loved it for what it set out to do. This game worked on a small budget, only just barely above 300 grand, and was lucky to get what it got, so I wasn't expecting too much, but I did enjoy what they were able to do. I don't see a lot of people being very understanding of this though, so this game definitely falls under the 'either love it or hate it' category. NightCry was definitely made for Clock Tower fans of the first two original. Following the same dynamics and principles. If the first two games didn't appeal to you, or old school Japanese horror (we're talking PSX/PS2-era) isn't your cup of tea, then there's a chance you might not be able to appreciate it.  If nothing else, wait for the patches and at least give it a try. Maybe it just might surprise you.  Speaking for myself as a Clock Tower fan, I was overall pleased with NightCry and feel it is a worthy successor to the original titles. I didn't regret my time at all with this game, and I hope that it improves to be even better in the near future.  Overall score: 7.6/10.",

            "review_text": "I loved this game. Im one of the Kickstarter Backers of this project, and it turned out to be everything I wanted it to be. Im a big fan of the older Clock Tower games (also made by Hifumi Kono) and this game basically felt like that, but new again. Right down to the Cheesiness, sometimes strange line of thinking, weird puzzles and corny plot. Like if you loved the old Clock Tower games, even with their charming faults, this will make you feel right at home again.  I only really have 2 gripes with this game: 1. I wish their was Chase music like in the old Clock Tower games, and 2. sometimes its buggy. But whats nice is the bugs are getting fixed on a daily basis, and most of the time if you tweet Kono-san he fixes them as soon as he can. For a team of like 6 guys or so, they really knocked this out of the park!  Also, fun tip, once you get to Rooney's chapter, check her phone! Im Dave Bruno, and Im like third on the Snap N Post photos! I was part of the $400 Tier, hence why I show up in the game.",

            "review_text": "So 15 or so hours has given me more time to think about how I really look at this game.   Pros: It's very reminiscent of the original clocktower games, evasion/hiding spots, cursor controls, intense chase scenes. I really liked that and it felt really cool to see this concept in modern day. And while the point-and-click controls were a little wonky at times, it wasn't too bad.   Cons: Other reviews have gone into detail about the bugs and such so I won't go into it. Although at one point in-game you open up the upper floor to a balcony which has a hiding spot, but if you are being chased, the character won't go up the stairs as if it's still closed off. Meaning if you get chased more than once in that chapter, you're screwed.   Next, I feel that the 'did you do this?' system is very flawed. While previous clock tower games (Clock Tower 2 had this issue too) had item/action requirements that affected the outcome of the game, it wasn't this heavy handed. Having me die in some ridiculous fashion every 8 minutes because I didn't do some vague action becomes tiring and immersion breaking. There needs to be a period of non-consequential gameplay so I don't have to worry if turnng not a handle 3 times just got me a instant bad ending. (Just a made-up example, not a spoiler.)  And lastly, the game fails to explain very important features. Mainly the save system/and continue system. Phone chargers are explained as able to 'charge the in-game phones battery' and nothing more, so I didn't think about it as anything else. And for the continue system, I didn't know the game checkpoints at certain segments so all I was left to go off of was a new chapter button showing up on the save data pathways.   This translated to at one point in the game me repeating half of chapter 2 and the beginning of chapter 3 multiple times because the game didn't display a new button for chapter 3. It doesn't until you complete the first section of that chapter. And with an initial chase that can easily lead you to a dead end and die for lack of stamina, it came to multiple retries until I found out through the discussion board about saving and continuing.   So, in the end, do I recommend this game? It does capture a concept I loved very much from the clocktower games and I love how intense and high-stake the chase segments are. The scisssorwalker character is so well done design wise and is very intimidating. It is effective in pulling me in. I recommend this game for it's on-point concepts but without proper directions about basic elements in the game implemented, I don't know if I should entirely.",
