            "review_text": "Decisive Campaigns: Barbarossa Don't know if i should do a review this early into the game,but when you think about it,does it really matter when ive made up my mind already!?.I only bought this game yesterday morning,but its still on in the background along with a stack(x10)of youtube tutorials'thrown'onto the Tv.Now i seriously struggle with HoI3(Hearts of iron)and it really frustrates me so that i can't play it!!.So you can see i was a little worried to begin with,but this just passed as quick,as i started to shove my units around the'board',this game is totally playable from the off,which im happy to say.The built in tutorials,theres quite a few watch them all before you play is my 'Tip Of The Day',some of them ive played a number of times already and ill probally visit them again too,they are just the right length not boring or too technical,i sat and watched all of them in one go.You will learn stuff that would fly past you otherwise unnoticed.  Im going to keep this review short mainly because of the samll amount of hours ive put in,read more reviews if your still not sure,this is NOT HoI thankfully.This is ooozing with stats+info so if you like that then...The GFX are even passable i mean a few more explosions etc and maybe a little movement with the icons ont he top of the counters would have been nicer,but i understand that you dont need top notch graphics for TBS,but i have seen recently i think on matrix games think it was Order of Battles newest title correct me if im wrong,has nice effects as each units makes its moves.  Only one gripe(See Edit at bottom) and thats just been spotted on the Tutorial video playing behind me is showing a swastika on its german flags which is totally fine by me,and mine only has Nato or politiically correct counters!;) Maybe this tutorial was shot in beta?CoH did this a few years back and it was disapointing.Leave them in even if its for realisms sake,and they look much better too,apart from that the game is awesome and beyond my expectations in the end,going to get the Case blue next 100%,itching to get it now,but as steams summer sale is coming up i might be able to hold on a few more weeks for the % but idk for sure.Seeing as im getting back into hexwar games,played PG to death back in its day,who didnt?,this game is is along the same lines but with so much more included,i was torn between thisDC:B or Gary Grisbys as they both look very similar indeed and after doing my homework i chose to buy this.  You won't be disapointed if you love Hexwar Games with a bit more than the average,and Perfect if your an Infomation ♥♥♥♥!?,it's got stats galore!...great game so far...and it was a nice bonus to get the 20%off £6.00 is a nice discount.-EDIT:My Game now has the rather nice 'Classic'counters which you can find in that LINK below from Philippe_at_bay.My Counters now have Lovely Artwork on them,this game really is a little Gem.You can modify the pants off it!:)&gt;&gt;If you like this Review and like me went and bought the Game use that link below and it will take you to the Hub where youc an get all sorts of Files to shape the Game how YOU like it!.Enjoy.EDIT:(Since i have managed to put back the original Flags,thats twice now,so i make steam now not update ANY of my games.Im happy this game lets you do this,after we are all adults here and its fine in the UK.This is becoming such that now im making it a point to not purchase world war two games that are with PC symbols,after all how can you tell they are germans?You can't,because with out symbols they could just as well be Hungarians or even Romanians.Leave the things alone.Fair play to the guys at VR games.:) I will continue to buy your Games.21/11/2016",
