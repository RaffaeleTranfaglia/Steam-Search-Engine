Everytime I switched it and left the menu it switched it back. I have no idea what the win condition of each level is, you physically cannot collect all of the money that you earn from killing enemies, and the game design requires you to die multiple times just to figure out some of the puzzles. Terrible game and I would not recommend this game.  Save your $2 and buy an ice cream or something.",
