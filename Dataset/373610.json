            "review_text": "Quite possibly one of the best shoot-em-up games in history. This game has a unique gameplay twist where you can keep stacking on more and more ships with every 1UP you get. You can easily have 30 ships under your control. Using the left and right triggers you can expand your ships to take up a larger area on the screen or you can compress them down to the size of a single ship. You might not think there would be any reason to expand them but the weapons change a bit once you spread them out, making it very handy in some cases but increasing danger by giving yourself a larger area to get hit.  I've never seen a shmup where the direction will change from moving upwards, to sideways, to backwards, constantly throughout the levels. You often have a choice of which direction to go as well. Not only is this mechanic unique, it's also exectuted perfectly. Truly a benchmark for the genre.  They could have made it a bit longer though. I was able to beat the entire game (on normal difficulty) on my first playthrough in 20 minutes. There were quite a few stages and there is even another game mode where you do not have extra ships, just a single one where you can continuously keep upgrading it over time (but you can only get hit once for each stage or you lose that progress). This mode is more difficult but adds to the replayability factor. The Steam leaderboards work well too so even if you were a master of the game, you can keep replaying it to get as high on the leaderboard as possible.  I also loved to see the inclusion of the almost-naked girls everywhere in that one level and the boss battle with the giant girl who shoots you from her nipples. Although it sort of throws the atmosphere off, it is still tastefully implemented.   I can't wait to try some co-op with a friend. A must-have for any shmup fan!",

            "review_text": " Disclosure: I helped with pre-release testing for this game, and was given a key by the developer for that purpose.   In addition to the above disclaimer, though, I should note that I bought Shoot 1Up several years before this on XBox Live Indie Games, and that it quickly became - and still is - one of my personal favorite 'homebrew' shooters. As the official description says, in most scrolling 'shmups' you control one ship at a time and simply switch in one of your reserve lives when you die, but here 1Up items are not only fairly commonplace but are deployed instantly, to the point where you can control up to 30 onscreen fighters simultaneously, A novel concept, certainly, but more important is how well the developer has implemented his marquee mechanic, and thus created something much more noteworthy than a never-to-be-revisited experiment for its own sake.  While the only 'main' buttons you ever have to worry about here are 'move', 'shoot', and 'brake' (which slows you down for more precise positioning), the 'expand' and 'contract' commands are equally important - hold down the former and your squadron expands outward in a circle formation (but will squish together when pressed against the screen's edge), while the latter will condense everyone down to the size of a single ship. Staying tightly together makes dodging enemies and their attacks, which come from all sides of the screen, much easier, but also limits your firepower to 'pea shooter' power - to really wreak some havoc you'll need to get dangerous and spread out, which not only sends shots in additional directions but unleashes the huge 'plasma auger' laser, which is great for mowing baddies down.   If you prefer to get more up close and personal with the opposition there's also the 'burst' weapon. If you stop shooting for a moment a circle will start to expand around each of your fighters; tap 'fire' after this and a short-range blast within the circles' area will heavily damage enemies and cancel bullets too. Your final 'weapon' is the explosion left behind when one of your ships eats an attack; like the burst it causes heavy damage and neutralizes enemy fire, giving you a chance to regroup and get back on the offensive.   What really makes all of the above so engaging, however, is the scoring system. It's actually very simple: basically, the more spread-out your formation is, the more valuable the point items destroyed enemies drop. Moreover, finishing baddies off with the 'burst' grants an additional bonus, so if you're brave enough to both leave your fighters vulnerable and get right in your targets' faces before unloading at the last second, you'll be swimming in points in no time. That said, extra lives are not point-dependent, so newer players are free to progress more conservatively and get the feel for things, while genre vets can jump right into the heavy risk-reward stuff: it should be noted that just getting to the end isn't particularly difficult or drawn-out, even on the 'Hard' difficulty setting, so the real challenge here comes from score attacking and mastering the constant tug-of-war between moving out or falling back.  Mommy's Best Games has always had a knack for creating memorable, irreverent and occasionally disturbing visuals for its releases, and that talent is on full display here: a strange, unnerving combination of the organic and mechanical infuses every sprite and background on offer, from fortress-sized protozoa to militarized orca corpses to the infamous 'robo-boob' lady boss, and almost makes you forget that there's a pretty run-of-the-mill 'last desperate hope against the alien menace' plot behind it all. The sound takes a similar tack, with most of the music more subdued and foreboding than you usually expect from a shooter, and a good deal of unearthly wailing and bellowing emitting from the bosses in particular, alongside the requisite bevy of explosions.  Finally, if you prefer a slightly more 'traditional' shooter experience there's also an easily-unlockable 'Score Trek' mode, which limits you to a single ship (this means Game Over after one hit, so be careful) whose power increases in a more traditional fashion via the '1Up' items. Moreover, you can save your progress after every level to mitigate the reduced margin of error, and the game loops upon completion, so your opportunities for climbing up the leaderboards are limited only by your persistence. Two new modes ('Goof-off', which grants loads of extra 1Ups, and 'Turn-based', which pauses the action when no buttons are pressed) and numerous tweaks (prettier score medals, incoming enemy warnings, adjusted squadron movement, etc.) have been added for the Steam release, so unless you're really down on 'oddball' games or scrolling shooters in general I simply can't think of too many reasons not to recommend this, especially for the asking price.",
