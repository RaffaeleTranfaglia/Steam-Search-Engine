            "review_text": "Melissa K is a HOG wth puzzles, with a good story and graphics, as well. I highly enjoyed it and the game does have some replayabilty bonus as well. I found the HOG parts of the game fun and challenging, the puzzle parts were also challenging, a few of the puzzles are even more diffcult than challenging. There is some extras to play as well, as you can attempt to get better scores on all three levels of puzzles outside of the story of the game. This can add hours of playtime for the game and it's pretty fun as well.  The game possibly can be a little buggy, there is help in the forums for those that find they have a problem. Also, a few of the achievements are broke on steam. As far as getting all the achievements there are a couple that would be pretty difficult to get, I finally gave up trying to get the last two myself after quite a few times of trying.   If you like more challenging HOG/puzzle game, I recommend getting this. It is very fun and gives you more hours of playtime than the normal HOG game.  ",

            "review_text": "It's more of adventure game with some puzzle and hidden object thrown in than the reverse. My biggest complain is the hidden object element itself. Rather than giving you a list of things to find, they show you the items you need to find (usually pieces of puzzle) making it just click anything that looks any bit out of place. The graphic is pretty, and I like the animation/3d effect. But on the other hand you can really feel that this game is made for touch pad. Too much click-hold and dragging for computer user. And you can't change the language in game. All in all I guess this is good for little kids with ipad, but maybe not for steam users or even HOG/Adventure game players.   Btw the horror element is decent though, the dev should make a horror game. Featuring the gecko, preferably.",

            "review_text": "A good  casual  adventure game, mixing point-and-click puzzles, many cool mini-games, and a few hidden-object scenes. It's an Indiana-Jones-type adventure -- with  very  obvious homages -- but with a female protagonist, who is refreshingly not sexualized -- though she's also kept uninteresting in any other way. (And what's with the name Melissa K? Yawn.)  It's an easy play that won't tax your mind too much, but will still offer many diversely satisfying moments. You can sit back and enjoy the plot, engage yourself in medium-hard puzzles, or just marvel at the graphics.  The graphics engine indeed represents a breakthrough for this genre: 3D effects mixed with the usual lush 2D scenes, with excellent character animation direction. It is a treat!  The background story is based on Thai Buddhism, a topic that as far as I know has never been covered in a video game before this one. The research both in terms of story conception and graphics design are surprisingly good, within the limitations of the genre.",

It's got a few good challenges, but if you're to play this game, don't buy it at full price, wait for the sale.",

            "review_text": "Very good game. It has an original approach to the scenes - you have to look around, they are 3D-ish. The story is not obvious, characters are interesting and animations are realy nice. Voice acting is also very agreable, even if a bit too slow for one of the characters (but I guess that was meant to suit his old age). Music and sounds are wonderful, combined with the animations and moveable scenes it's like you're in the game. Oh, and of course those Indiana Jones references :D Both hidden object scenes and puzzles are difficult enough to keep the player concentrated, but not to the point of making him bang his head on the keyboard.  I've already won the game once and I'm just about to play it again, and that speaks for itself.",

            "review_text": "I put some hours into this game and I can say, without a doubt, that it isn't....bad.  I wasn't blown away, but I don't think I overspent with my 3 dollers I paid for this game.   The graphics for the backgrounds are gorgeous. Whoever drew them had a good deal of fun and skill, and they are really nice to look at, especially the jungle and water oiasis area later in the game. Sadly the animations on the people are derpy. Your guide looks a bit malnourished, but only in his arms. And when he talks he opens his mouth way to wide for the smallest words; it's kind of like an awkward play-dough. Same goes for a monk you meet later. The animations on Melissa during cut-scenes aren't that bad, but her boobs are jacked.  The story isn't bad, but it is spotty. I never heard anything about Queen Elizabeth in game, contrary to the description. I do know Melissa works in an office and gets invited to teach a young monk in Bangkock politics or something similar. Why? No idea. Apprently she's famous and gets a huge warm welcome when she arrives that's featured in the papers. The little monk goes missing and you gotta find him. There's quickly some hint towards the paranormal with some scenes that made me jump because they literally come out of no where. No build up, no warning; just bam, creepy imagery and delightfully terrifyinig sound effects.  Melissa has some visions, blah, blah. There's a lot to do with Buddism and the legend around it and the atmosphere is very nice. You meet this random guy that literally shows up out of no where but apprently Melissa knows - he's an old professor or some such, and either they screwed each other some time in the past or they both kind of wish they screwed each other and never got around to the act. I don't know if there are others of this games that should make me understand, but I'm lost from just playing this one.  Otherwise the gameplay is nice. Good clicking, and you can move the mouse to give you different perspectives in the scenes, which works really nice to give it a more 3D/real enviroment feel. Puzzles aren't too hard and sometimes might be too easy. I'm playing on medium because easy is literally TOO EASY.  Anyhow. The voice acting is pretty good, the cutscenes can end a bit suddenly and be a bit rushed, but the commentary from Melissa can be rather funny and she's overall the best character.   I reccomend the game because, despite the flaws, it's a pretty good with a pretty good storyline, when you know what's going on. Just don't buy it for full price; I'd say 50 percent off or less.  7/10 ",

            "review_text": "I'm not a huge fan of hidden object games, but I enjoyed this one very much. For a game with such a low price, this has quite high production values. The voice acting is quite good, the hand-drawn art is beatifully done, and the 3D rendering was also mixed in very well for a seamless experience. Most of the point and click puzzles were challenging enough without being too overwhelmng.   That said, the final 'reverse Tetris' puzzle was very annoying and felt out of place due to being more of an arcade game instead of a logic puzzle. I guess it's meant to be a bit of a joke because there's an achievement for failing this particular mini-game 10 times, but it still really didn't have a place when compared to the other puzzles.  My only other gripe is that a few of the individual solutions didn't make a lot of sense. There were a few times when the game (via the 'hint' button) showed me the solution and I thought to myself, 'Seriously? I would never have made that association.'  Even with those bumps, the game was primarily a smooth ride. The story was enough to keep my interest and there were several nods to the various 'Indiana Jones' movies and made me smile. If SDP games makes more games like this (minus the arcade-y bits) I'll be a repeat customer for their games.",

If you have the patienece to understand and somehow get all the subtle clues. This game has TOP notch quality and awesome 3D idea to change the normal static 2D of most point and click adventure games i played.  I may not finish this game... It is not a bad game but i just could not stomach how the story progresses leaving the player up in the air clicking on everything or just clicking the hint button.  ",
