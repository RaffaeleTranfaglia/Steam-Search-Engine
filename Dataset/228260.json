            "review_text": "i'm not typically a serious fan of city/army builder games like this, but Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes is one of those games that is just what I was looking for at the time. If you're a fan of Sid Meier's Civilization series, this game MIGHT be up your alley. In my opinion, it is way better in many ways. A lot of people say differently... So here's a rundown of why I recommend this game:  1) You get to have a 'main character', which you either pick from, or make your own through customization options. You can also make your own faction up, so to speak and pick your perks etc. 2) There is an EXTREME PLETHORA of troop choices due to customization options to create the exact troop type you are looking for, You can even customize how they look, including gender. Seriously, this is an amazing thing that I haven't seen in too many other games of this type. 3) The battle system is like a hybrid of regular turn-based strategy games of this nature, and something like a less-intricate version of games like Final Fantasy Tactics, Fire Emblem, and Agarest (tactical battle games). See your unique leader and troops battle across actual landscapes, with terrain that affects movement and line of sight in a much more detailed way than typical builder games. Strategize your positions. Feel like you're actually battling!!  There's really only one big problem I have with this game, and that would be the lack of multiplayer... I hear it crashes a lot, but I haven't really had much issue with this. Other than that however, I don't really see a whole lot wrong with it. I saw someone saying it's not a 'completed game' but I felt pretty content with it. I mean, I wouldn't go paying 40 dollars for it but I wouldn't pay that for almost any game, simply because that's a lot of money to me... I don't make that much...  Should you buy this game...? It really depends on what you want in a game. If you're a high-fantasy fan who loves customization and city building, maybe. If you're a fan of grid-based tactical combat games, it just might be up your alley. If you like all of that stuff, you'll probably like this game. Should you spend 40 dollars on it? Ehhhh..... I wouldn't but if you have tons of money to blow, why not? I would honestly wait for a sale, or do some more research beyond my review... I hope i helped you out somehow in your decision however.",

This is not pure 4X game as 'everybody' claims because there is a heavy role playing.    Pro  + it's turn based 4X and RPG game in one package + 10 predetermined factions and souvereigns are pretty divers + but you can create your own + and you can design units which is my favourite part of game + game is pretty imbalanced so there are various ways of winning + like other Stardock's games, it's highly modable + very high quality mini and total conversion mods + epic music and it's available in mp3 for free + super fast loading + a lot of customization options + I like Battle for Anthys scenario   Neutral  +- both hilarious and semi-compentent AI – they are early pioneer spammers which leads to quick expanding and stealing resources under your nose, but that makes AI settlements to have huge unrest which means totally crippled production and research; some factions are great at quick doom stack spamming (looking at you V.erga) and some are outright terrible every game (those heavy oriented on magic or economy always fail); AI factions use spells mostly ok, and if they have Tornado it's very annoying +- victory conditions (they are standard for these type of games; unfortunately AI is incapable of winning via Dragon Lord quest) +- Stardock account (it's one time registration, it won't pop up ever again) +- diplomacy and trading (I really miss trading, gifting and liberating settlements; otherwise it's mostly good)   Cons  - cheating AI – neutrals almost completely ignore AI factions; above challenger difficulty, AI has economy script; AI dodges frequently your attacks and it's disgusting!; battle's outcomes sometimes don't have any sense: I can lose several units and win then reload and use auto-solve and lose nothing. - terrible lagging when fighting in jungle/forest map (come on, it's turn based!) - terrain doesn't matter in tactical mode (standing behind rock or trees doesn't matter) - settlements can't cross river (unless modded) - it doesn't make sense - there are huge water surfaces but there is no way to cross them - bugs, bugs and more bugs (always save max after 2 turns because of unexpected bugs and cheating AI) - crossbows are completely useless - Fallen Enchantress scenario is the huge waste of time - DLCs are mostly worthless or/and bugged (Map and Quest Pack are only worth)   Final score:  8/10 and recommended for buying base game (no DLCs outside Quest and Map!).    Mandatory mini mods:  Parrottmatth mods (Snaking Mod, River City Bridge, Swamp Tiles, Armored Militia, Armor Attributes, Summoner Unit, Female Henchman), Black Market Bazaar, Level 6 and 7 Cities, Armor Visuals, AI Plus, Name Generator, More Visible Move Radius in Tactical, Dragon Taming for LH and Beast Mode.",

I quickly lost my first scenario as I was overrun by both wild creatures and enemy forces, but I felt like I learned from that first atempt. I used my new knowldege to fire up the same scenario again. This time I got much further but eventually I lost again. With each defeat I learned more and used that knowledge to improve my game. I learned that when I make custom units if I want to be able to upgrade them to plate mail later I need to give them the plate mail ability even if my current armour is only leather.I also learned that once a unit is trained as a foot soldier of some type it can not be given a mount latter on (I don't like that rule but knowing it helps out).   there are small differance between the factions but I don't really see that much of a differeance between how the factions play. The biggest differeance is the Sovierng you start with.   I wish there was some form of multiplayer even if it was hot seat. I also wish there was naval units/war fare. Whenever you run into a body of water there is no way to hop on a boat and travel. Still I've had lots of fun playing this game. Especially when fighting dragons and other big optional bosses on each map.",

What does stardock do after that? well they give the fans the enxt 3 games FREE. Legendary Heroes is a awesome game and one of hte best strategy games of the last few years. Stardock listens to there fans and there fans love htem for it, if you want a new strategy game with rpg elements pick this up!

Set up a 'colonly', build a few buildings and expland your territory. There is a party adventure mode as well that lets you explore your world, upgrade your adventurers, and collect items to equip them with. The campaign could use some work though... a bit more depth, cut scenese, voice overs, ect. But really I bought this game for the map editor and sandbox mode. After awhile (40 hours) it does tend to get repetative. That said I was intrigued enough to play each sandbox custome game to see each individual ending related to that vicotry condition. If there was a way to infuse 'more story' into the game it'd be a real gem. The only knock against this game is if you play the 'huge' map setting. I have an advanced gaming rig that starts to chug and eventually crash if the world is overly populated with cites.  An 8 out of 10. If the developers would add cutscences and some RPG elements it could easily climb to a 10 out 10. The expansion packs seem focused towards 'new loot' and different AI characters to play against. They don't really add very much to the gaming experiance so only buy them if you have a couple extra bucks collecting dust.",

Neither aspect of the game is fleshed out fully and this leaves you somewhat unsatisfied in both arenas.   That being said, the game is not without merit. While it's not as deep as other games, it's a decent way to scratch your TBS itch. The character models are decent and the inclusion of a fantasy setting makes the city-building interesting when starting out. The game isn't worth the asking price of $40, but if you see it on sale for $10 or less, it's probably worth your time if you're a fan of Civilization and TBS games.",

Every game begins like any Civilization game, where you found your capital city and then start to explore the world. However, instead of your standard units like Civilization has, you have customized units that you can design yourself. You also have heroes, which are specialty one-man armies that will join your cause from time to time.   If you've played Age of Wonders III, the combat is remarkably similar. When you enter battle, both factions are placed on the opposite side of the battlefield, and you move them into play until they're in range to strike.   The world itself is incredibly detailed. On almost every playthrough, I'll run into a quest or monster that I've never seen before, and every game spawns one of four special areas of the map where you can fight boss-type monsters and aquire extremely rare treasure. Every game brings something new.  PROS:  - Incredibly varied worlds - Good combat system - Lots of 'fluff'  - Wide variety of artifacts and weapons - Useful character creator  CONS:  - Some factions just plain suck - Game can be glitchy, particularly when loading saves - Soundtrack's rather forgettable   FINAL VERDICT  First off, buying this game with all the DLC will leave you homeless.

One thing that I enjoy about the game is that it’s VERY different from other fantasy 4X games in a number of key ways.  First, it takes place many years after the world was devastated by a war of magic – it’s essentially a post-apocalyptic fantasy world. Virtually everything concerning magic and technology had been lost (technology in this case being the standard medieval-level of weaponry and military tactics). You’re leading a rag-tag group of survivors to build your faction’s first city and begin to rebuild. Of course, you were chosen as leader because you are one of the only people remaining who can wield magic.  Secondly, there’s none of the standard Orcs, Goblins, Elves, Dwarves, blah blah blah that have become standard fare for fantasy games. The races are all (with the exception of Men) completely original, as are most of the bestiary that pose a constant threat outside of the safety of your cities. However, the game makes all of the new races and creatures easy to understand with a very thorough and easy-to-access online guide that seamlessly integrates lore and story with game mechanics. Want to know what the Trogs can do before you play as them? Just hover over the attribute marker reading TROG BLOOD in the character roster and see their benefits and disadvantages. Got an army of Brood Hunters headed for a city? Just click on the army on the map and click their profile to read all about them and see their stats.  Also, virtually everything is customizable. Make new leaders, new factions, new units. Just researched Warg Riding and want to make some cavalry? Just pop into the unit design screen and design them, what armor they wear and what weapons they carry, etc. Just make sure you have a source of Wargs handy – depending on what weaponry and armor you give your units, you may need a variety of resources (metal, horses/Wargs, magic crystal, etc) to create them. These can be found on the map and brought under control of your cities by building on them.  All-in-all, it’s a great game that slipped under the radar to a certain extent.",

I love 4X games, and probably own most of the known ones, but this one feels like it's lacking something.  **A few points:**  * tons of content in this game: items, loot, weapons, spells, there's a lot of them; * mob variety: a lot of variety, and they scale well among all levels and all of them have a little flavor description; * total lack of empire management: nothing at all; no 'empire plan' or 'social policies' or 'virtues' or anything similar to adapt your empire; * diplomacy is rather dull and almost useless, because every AI will eventually hate you and want to kill you because of such modifiers as 'we want to establish order to the world' which makes them want to destroy you even if they are your ally. You cannot play peacefully in this game, you will be rolled over if you don't maintain a huge army at all times; * quests on the map: similar to Endless Legend, only way more boring and uninteresting. They have huge amount of uninteresting text. The Endless Legend ones seem a lot more compelling and they tie in to the lore of the game, not here; * combat is dull: there's a *swarm* mechanic, where all your adjacent units will attack an enemy, but that's about the only twist there is to it. The combat itself is not bad, and spells are actually interesting and strategic, but the presentation of the combat is dull and all units looking almost the same doesn't help either; * performance: surprisingly poor for the look of the game. The engine is much more optimized then it was before, I have reported the issue a long time ago and Brad, the CEO of Stardock took personal interest in fixing this, and they did, but still I get the same FPS as in Farcry 3 so this might be an issue for some people; * turn wait time: almost inexistent because the AI things while you take your turn and just executes the moves when you press the button; * late game is a nightmare: there are no governors for the cities and destroying the cities can only be done after 5 turns after it has been conquered. Also, destroying a city, leaves 'fertile' ground where the AI could build another one; * developing cities is honestly as dull as it is in Age of Wonders 3: you choose one of three specializations: Science, Military/Production or Growth/Money and from then on you just build the specialized buildings in the same order, you can just queue them for 100 turns, it makes no difference; * race differentiation: very little; they all look the same, except for some DLC ones, and the only difference is in bonus stats and sometimes a unique unit or building. Nothing even remotely close to the extent of Endless Legend;  That being said, I cannot recommend this game, because there's Endless Legend and Age of Wonders 3. They're both better games for different reasons: Endless Legend for civilization building and economy and trade and diplomacy, and Age of Wonders 3 for the superb combat and unit variety and that sense of fantasy adventure.",

While im using a pentium i3 with 8gb of memory, the game ran OK, but ending a turn generally took about 10-20 seconds to process everything. You will be ending turns ALOT in this game because everything takes forever to make.  I decided to forgo the tutorial and quickly realized this was a civ style game. Unlike civ, you can only build cities on green tiles that have resources. Due to a mistake I made with my settlers by clicking the outpost button, and the inability to undo a turn I was left at a disadvantage while it took another 6 turns to produce another settler. During this time, the AI hemmed me in and I was stuck to two cities the whole game. I kept playing thinking I could research and negotiate my way out of it. Impossible.  After researching everything I needed to earn capital quickly, I paid the most powerful player to declare war on my neighbor. This had virtually no effect as they both continued to grow more powerful. I should have known because when my neighbor declared war on me, his army consisted of two scouts and three archers and that was it. All of the AI's soldiers were garrisoned in the cities with 400+ attack power. With a limitation of 6-7 slots in an army and NO system for reinforcing one army with another it becomes impossible to dislodge them.   After figuring out how rigid the game is, I just stopped playing. A day wasted, but money saved.",

This is the predecessor of this game, with minor patches. The changes and added content in this 'stand alone expansion' are an order of magnitude less than what I've ever seen in any expansion, stand alone or otherwise.  And the game itself is only 75% done - it is still unfinished, unbalanced, and riddled with more bugs than any finished game should have in the late Beta phase.   The things that are unfinished are: - A ridiculous amount of bugs (e.g. wrong camera perspective in worldmap until you restart, missing tooltips that should tell you how strong the enemy is, cannot select a unit until you restart, music stops until you restart, game crashes, etc), usually I encounter about 2 of these per hour. - Performance (runs very slow on Haswell integrated graphics) - AI is very very weak - Lategame gameplay not interesting, due to bad balance and AI - Manual and in-game help incomplete, not usable  A few balance changes and A LOT of bugfixes, and this game would be good. Add in a decent AI and it would be great. Unfortunately it doesn't have these and never will, so thumbs down.",

Game loaded very slowly and laucnhed into a poor, somewhat incoherent, pale immitation to the intro to Lord of The Rings.....but I wasn't put off.  4) Changed AA setting and was told game would have to restart. Started to get put off.  5) Restarted game. Took ages to start up.....again. Getting more put off now.  6) Chose to execute Tutorial. Tutorial turned out to be more like a 90s infomercial, crammed into a tiny little box about half the size of my screen (?). Now I'm beginning to get irritated.  7) Attempted to move my character as directed in the tutorial. Spent 10 minutes trying to move character. Failed. Extremely annoyed by now.   8) Figured #6 must be a bug so exited and restarted game. Waited again. Game crashed. Deleted. Never again. Absolutely appaling and pathetic. 1 Hour of my life I'll never get back and an unwarranted invasion of privacy.",
