            "review_text": " Thank you to the developers for generously supplying me with a review key.  ---    The Minotaur  is a small puzzle-solving coffee break game, with the added bonus of local couch play.  While there are a few different modes such as endless and time-attack, the fairly simple puzzle solving mechanic does not change drastically throughout.  Essentially, you push blocks in order to 'squish' or 'entrap' minotaurs.  The minotaurs have a few variants, but could definately use more.   Pros:  +Music and artwork is very nice +Navigating the menus in-game with the character always works out well IMO +While the modes do not differ greatly, they give options +Multiplayer works great, with solid controller support   Cons:  -As I am playing this, I often wonder if it would have been better off being strictly turn-based (ie. I move 1 turn, and then the minotaurs get 1 turn, repeat). As it stands, the minotaurs move in real-time, which leaves me thinking less and making hasty moves. Would more strategy be good here? -The base mechanic is fine, but definately not enough to get me addicted. Its been done one-too-many times before. -Powerups scattered on the board would surely add entertainment value. Having players scramble for things that make the game easier or harder would be great.  -Surely something that could be fixed - sometimes you spawn with an enemy literally right next to you and its insta-death. No big deal, since death doesn't mean much, but this should be fixed. -I find trying to achieve a certain score to be fairly boring and meaningless. Maybe give me meta-game unlocks? How about character color/skin customization?   Look, this is not a fail by any means. I mean this is a great start for this developement team. As I always ask: would I recommend it to my friends to run out and spend their hard-earned money? No.  I'd keep this developement team on my radar, because there is real potential - and they have shown that they can deliver a final, stable, product. Best of luck to them with this, and future work.",
