            "review_text": "i'm still early in the game but i like what i see so far, will update the guide later when i have more playtime  Pros - Great character design by Zero Escape artist, Nishimura Kinu! - Spiritual sucessor of Guardian Heroes (made by the same team) - 4 playable character in campaign and way waaaay much more for pvp &amp; stuff (i heard it's like 50 or something, you can play as everyone after all - including the npcs &amp; enemies) - burst system is really really fun, you manage your mp to do as many damage as possible - lock system is interesting for magic user, homing attack! - Level up &amp; equipment system - Multiplayer co-op works perfectly! - The game is pretty deep, at first button mashing works. Later you need to learn to block, when to change plane &amp; analize the enemy's behavior. As you get farther, learning when to use Burst correctly can really means winning/losing (burst can cancel your enemies' attack, very useful against aggresive mob).  Cons - I wish it's real 2D sprites instead of captured 3D sprites T__T - Some of the idle animations looks weird - Atlus quality translation (liberal)",

You can even change the text to Japanese, if you want to. Take the translations with a grain of salt, if you know or are learning Japanese. If you're catching on and understand the contextual meanings behind what they are saying, look at that as a positive to your knowledge. :-)",

I mean I would sugest you to end it all since there is no point on living... BUT GOOD NEWS!!.. this game is the oportunity to get back all that lost time!!, is not as cool and fast paced as the original GH was, but Hell it feels good!, the extense characters pool, the instinctive combos, is all there, this is a spiritual succesor worth playing.. specially online so please DO BUY this jewel and jump over since for its price, is one hell of a deal for the fun it brings.",
