            "review_text": "There is a lot I like and do recommend it; HOWEVER, and there is a lot I don't like about this game.  The good parts:  just love the graphics! Love the audio! Love love love the concept behind the whole premise of the game! It's genius! Almost everything about it is just fun. The different characters being animals and their traits. etc. This has so much potential for expansion it isn't funny. The whole game as it is now could be one small room in a whole castle or kingdom. and jsut a small part of the story. (sorry in game development so get too excited about the potentials.. feature creep) Anyway, the like part of this is so broad that it's hard to put it in a few words and I don't have time or the finger durability to write it all down. I love the fact that it's difficult to master. ... but the game is too random card wise to get really good at it or turning situations. I love that you can win in different ways. like I said .. this game has so much genius in it.    However, in the hopes that the dev team sees some of this I will detail a little more in the 'don't like' side of things. Because I want to keep playing!  First of all, the games are not short most of the time, and that is good, but there is no way to save a game and come back to it later. If you have to stop and quit due to life, you loose all progress. I don't need a bunch of saves to cheat with. I just want to save to come back to later. It took me almost 3 hours to play one game. Sometimes I don't have that long to play but don't want to screw myself out of playing because I don't have 3 hours. Online play, well doh, no need for it there but locally, that is a feature I'm frankly appauled isn't in there yet. That is an industry standard for any tabletop or turn based game. ... in fact most all games.  A couple of times I played a card, for example, one that takes one prestige from each player. palyed the card no problem, and everyone still had all their prestige and I got 0. There are a few cards in there that are similar that seem to be buggy in general or buggy to one character.. but it isn't consistant enough to give you a bug report with any helpful info in it to track it down.   The randomness of the dice and cards are a bit too random. characters really don't get to build and use their strengths and weaknesses.. wait... Thane has no weaknesses (for example)... and always has money and prestige even if you take it all away. Even if he has an item of some sort. doesn't matter the game, whether he has city income or not or hasn't even gone treasure hunting, etc. Even if he gets killed 4 times in a row with no source of income , he's always got plenty of gold and presitge. LOL!! That kind of needs to be looked at. Makes for a great challenge if you got the right attitude, but even if you do, after a while it gets old.   I know unlocking jewelry and stuff helps you customize it a little bit but honestly, it's in areas that don't help that much in most characters... not all.. but most. What good is stealth in the city at one part of the day when it's likely they saw you go in there.. &gt;,&lt; It's just an example of the many things. Sure it might come in handy a sliver of the time but it really doesn't make you feel compelled to unlock much of anything... and there is no progression at all in any way to make you feel like you are playing more than a same scenario board game.   In the game you have to stay almost completely rot free to survive or go full rot.. you can't really play the middle of the road and have much of a chance of winning anything other than prestige or by stones.  I will have to say though, even with all the 'dark side' comments, it's worth 15 dollars... but if improvements aren't made soon, honestly I wouldn't pay 10 for it even as beautiful and artful as it is. The flaws are big gotcha's .. something as simple as a 'sorry you can't save your game and come back to it' is HUGE!!  I really hope this keeps progressing I love it and do recommend it.   Edit: It will save your progress in single player, but be aware there is no message that it will do so.",

And soon after they added stupid chests and keys like CSGO i have notice that people start to farm these.  Due to that players started rushing throw out that the game to collect them fast as possible. That pretty much is ruining the games now.  And a lot when there new chests added in to the game. they haven't done anything against these players this problem continues be warned.  One of the good and bad things about the game is there it's available on multiple platforms for example you can buy it from the PlayStation Store. And you can play against players if you play from PC.  But the bad thing is if you want play the game on a different platform it means you have to pay for the same game twice I'm not against it.  But the problem is that you have to buy all the DLCs that you already have from another platform.  New heroes that are added into the game are not free you have to pay for the usurper pack to gain four Heroes. I suspect also future content that you would have to pay for  For a buy to play game is too much ask.",

Attack/defense balance is cranked all the way towards the former, which means that even if you can kill your opponent thrice over, they are likely to kill you too, throwing you back to square one. * Way too much is left to chance. If RNG hates you, you can't do anything about it. * Matches are too short - 20 turns, 24 at custom rules, and any attack that wounds the King cuts that further down. * Next to no settings, specifically graphics, language (it always takes the setting from steam), ans such.  Overall, the game has great potential but it needs fixing. Right now it has little to boast aside from the good looks.",

Armello never stopped getting better while being developed, and the final release felt complete and well done, I concur that a hotseat option would be great, but the single player and multiplayer are already quite fun, really hard but quite rewarding even when you lose.

It was everything I looked for in a game. It has clever combat, an amazing backstory, good mechanics to it and I don't get sick of it.  Although, as time of writing, the player pool is small (probably due to the gigantic shadow of MGS5 and Mad Max) it has enough players to form games.  This game is absolutely amazing. I have played many good games in my life, the likes of Demon Souls and Civilization 4, and I can say this one found a place amongst them.  A polished, well thought, well written, 10/10 game.",

            "review_text": "Armello did something for me that no other game has been able to do effectively. It made tabletop strategy seem accessible and fun for me.   The tutorial does its job well. The way it presents the various gameplay concepts, staggered through different characters to show different approaches to the game, really helped make the ideas stick. While Armello has some fairly complex aspects to it, I was never left feeling intimidated as I often am by other games in this genre.   The art style is gorgeous and I feel this is one of the most beautiful games I've played in a long time. Despite basically being pawns on a board, each hero has its own distinct personality, which I personally find necessary for a game to be engaging and to have any longevity.  Though I'm only a few games in and can't comment on it at length, I do like the inclusion of a progression system. Being able to unlock items for my characters that allow me to alter their play style gives me more incentive to keep coming back.   The pace of the game can be a bit slow at times, since you not only have to wait for other players' turns but also the king's guards as well as any banes that have emerged on the map, but I feel that's really a minor issue.   Overall, I'm really happy with Armello so far and look forward to trying out the upcoming multiplayer ladder.",

            "review_text": "Oneshot, Mad King. That's all I need.  This game is a board game with eight different playable characters, each with their own unique ability and two to a single Clan, and can be played with friends or against bots as you quest to become the king or queen of Armello. If you hate RNG, just avoid this game. The game is heavily RNG-based, but heroes' passive abilities do work quite well, and the difficulty of the four victories varies. Prestige is easiest while Rot is hardest in my own experience. My only problem with the game is that it has a severe reliance on praying to RNGesus that whatever is happening goes in your favor. I'm honestly writing a review way sooner than I should be (11.5 hours upon writing this review) but so far I enjoy the game. Definitely a 4/5 to me, one of the games that I feel deserves an attempt at one of my few serious reviews.",

            "review_text": "I have played a couple of single player games to learn the mechanics. and 15-20 multiplayer games. Some of those have been with friends and some solo and all of them have been fun.  Pros: -8 characters (more on the way?) with different skills and playstyles -Multiple win conditions 3 fairly easy ones and 1 that is kinda difficult to set up if you want to give yourself a challenge -If you can't win play the spoiler and just mess with others for fun. Winning doesn't appear to give you anything other than some steam achievements so losing does feel bad just have fun playing. -Fairly quick queues for a game only once have i had to wait more than 2 minutes -Looks great graphically.  Cons: -Disconnects and freezes have happened 4 out of 20ish games (couple times friends DC, once game just wouldn't roll dice, and once another player DC, then the other two DC and i had 3 AI in the game). If the game gets stuck and doesn't progress you don't get the chest/key at the end. -No ranked yet (hope its coming soon) -Playing against a group of 3 in solo queue is fairly awkward when 3 work together. 1 person clearing out the castle and moving away so the player with the stones can just walk in and kill the king while the other 2 play bodyguard just isn't all that fun. has happened a couple of times.   Overall the game is very good and certainly worth the pickup. Reminds me of Talisman a bit and can see where the inspiration could have come from and thats not a bad thing.",

            "review_text": "    Save your money, buy a better strategy game.      I've been playing this game for about 100 hours and I think it's time that I write my review  First of all I'd like to say that this game is  VERY  RNG based, the only 'strategy' there is to this game is knowing what the cards do, and even then drawing the right cards is based on RNG (you'll most likely draw a scouting card). I'd also like to point out how bad the tile placements are in this game, usually I end up getting 2 swamps next to 2 mountains in the general area of my clan grounds completely blocking off one side of the board. On more than one occasion I've had 2 dungeons next to each other and ended up spawning 5 banes (3 of which I managed to roll for in their RNG based dungeon system and kill) and the last 2 just straight up spawned from the dungeons at night targeting me and ultimately killing me.  Another thing I want to point out is how badly broken this game is, most of the time the game just freezes up when I enter the palace to find the king loosing about 45 minutes of gameplay this is VERY frustrating, another common bug is the Menu straight up not working, on occasion when it asks me to ready up the ready button dissapears kicking me into another lobby and punishing me for leaving the game because I couldn't ready up, even the main menu breaks to the point where i'm just stuck looking at a blurry background of the king sitting on his throne. Another issue I have with this game is the online lobby completely not working at all, when i play with my friends we all ready up and suddenly it just throws us out of our lobby swaping fast between multiple lobbies of people waiting to play the game (I have no Idea how they plan to implement ranked mode with the current lobby system being garbage).  Finally I'd like to finish this by saying that I had high hopes for this game but ultimately it ended up just being next to just another shovelware game, maybe the developers will fix it but probably not, I see people on their forums complain to them and the usually they respond with a snarky comment followed by people whiteknighting them.   All I can say to LoG is Maybe next time.",

            "review_text": "Pretty disappointing.  I'm a big fan of board games, and was recommended this by a video reviewer I put good faith in.  The game is gorgeous, and has a lot of charm, however the gameplay just doesn't hold up.  Maybe it's because I listen to a lot of podcasts on game design, but this game was a fail. There's way too much luck involved, and most strategy you can conjure up hardly matters. The first two games I played I just happened to win because I was doing quests and playing cards when I could.   A good game boils down to making interesting decisions, but when playing this game there's very few to be had. Most of it doesn't even matter. Do I pick the quest that gives me a 30% chance to get a Spirit stone and a spirit that I won't use, or do I pick the quest that gives me a not useful companion that gives the health I'll probably need?   Do I win by killing the king because I happened to get some rot cards and died to the birds? Or do I kill the king because I got lucky enough to get two spirit stones from the dungeons and it was super easy to get the rest? It's just horribly dull.  Gameplay boils down to. 'Pick a character, use amulets/rings to give them small advantages.' This gives you the illusion that there's strategies to explore, but in actuality it ends up more like this:   Go to quest. Hopefully get something good out of it, or don't 'risk' it. (But good luck having any sort of a chance if you don't.) Explore dungeons, get random stuff, or don't. Get into fights. Win/Lose them depending on what equipment you happened to get and how lucky you were on your rolls. Someone on the board gets enough Rot/Spirit Stones/OP equips to kill king. Very little you can do to stop them. They fight the king and usually win. Sometimes they'll die in the process and someone else who did nothing all game will win instead. Game's over.  I hope more people explore the interesting design space there is in a digital board game in the future, but this game felt like all style and not substance.  If you're looking for a super casual game and have a high tolerance for swingy gameplay to play with a few buddies, then this is the game for you.  If you want something anything deeper than that, look elsewhere.  2.5/5",

Every move is a decision.  - Great artwork: The game just looks absolutely amazing. Especially the cartoonish artwork in the 'fight scenes'. - RNG: The game works with random cards you get in your hand, this makes every match a different experience. The fight system works with dices, so you can get lucky or very unlucky, but overall, the player with the best odds wins most of the battles.  The RNG part is something you may or may not like. I personally liked the RNG part, because the winner of the match is still mostly decided by skill, not RNG.   Cons: - Slow: In an online game you are waiting most of the time. This isn't that much of a problem since you can still play cards while it's not your turn, but still, one game takes about one hour.  - Matchmaking: Getting into an online match can take some time. EDIT: As of now, the wait timers are very reasonable.  Overall this game is worth your money if you like Strategy games and can enjoy the RNG parts.",

On the positive side, the different cards are very well made and beatiful to behold. Obviously, this doesn't make up for the fact that this game is very repetitive.

I tend to play by myself, but multiplayer is functional and offers a bit of a different experience. I love this game.  It's rare to find a game that packs so much, narratively and in terms of interesting mechanics, into a 90-minute session. All of Armello's characters are quite different from each other, and there's a lot of variety in how you set up your character to start. Once the game begins, though, it's time to be flexible, because with dice fights and card draws, you've got to enjoy rolling with the punches. I disagree with the reviewer who said that everything is determined in the first few turns -- things can, and do, change suddenly. If you want to set things up perfectly and then have them go exactly according to plan, you'll be thwarted.  Armello is well worth the money, and so is the expansion. It's fun, thrilling, sometimes heartbreaking, and just technically really well done. The studio crossed their t's and it shows, and I hope they continue expanding it in the future. I would definitely throw down cash for an RPG set in the same world.",

            "review_text": "This is my first review on steam. I have played about 80 hours on the game and have probably unlocked all the rings, each game taking about an hour or so. I bought this game out of curiosity since the graphics were just amazing to look at. The sound impressed me as well. What I like about it is that it is a friendly game that doesn't have in game chat. It kind of hinders the social experience of the game but keeps it civil, instead having the built in text to choose from. This game has an interesting concept of having four ways to win which is rot victory, highest prestige, 4 spirit stones, and defeating the king. It's really fun how there are lots of ways to win and kill your opponents. There is a lot of strategy going on, such as skill cards, magic cards, and trap cards. You must go on with your quest while defeating your enemies and winning by one of the four victories. There is a lot going on in this game. The dice is also an excellent touch, since it allows you to click on it randomly which allows it to be fair aND challenging. Beware that although I do recommend this game, there are still more developments that should be made. Such as when the Internet connection is loss, you are automatically kicked out and cannot join the same game. Penalties for leaving games should be longer since it destroys the overall game play of having to play with AL players. Ranked matches are also not availible yet. Overall I recommend this game despite its ongoing developments because it is visually satisfying and fun.",

            "review_text": "5/5 Stars  I'm one of the original backers for the game, and I'm very satisfied with having backed this project. It is exactly what I thought it would be in all of the early material, and it is just as much fun as I had hoped.   This is very much a board game that I don't think could reasonably exist in physical form due to its stealth, ambush, and quest mechanics, and thus is a unique experience for board gamers and something that should be added to any collection.  The characters and plot quests are reminiscent of Arkham Horror, as is the concept of multiple types of victory. I love Arkham Horror for its story and chacters, so of course I consider these to be good characteristics to emulate.  I love that the prestige leader gets to choose between two potentially very bad options. It provides a reason to stay competitive about prestige even if you're trying for a different kind of victory.  The AI is challenging and aggressive, so getting a victory is not a cakewalk and feels more like competing with other real players.  As for the graphics and music, I think the music is perfect for the game, and the animate card graphics are lovely. If I want to be picky, I think the 3D animations could have been better. They're a bit too sharp and block defined around the edges, though the movements are smooth. They're a bit reminiscent of early 3D animations in games rather than being on par with where we are right now. But in terms of turning out a great game on a budget and on schedule, I think the simpler animations were a good choice.  It's also worth mentioning that if you like achievement hunting in games, this is definitely a game for you, as even if you feel you're going to lose the quest to rule Armello, you can focus on completing some of the Steam achievements, which means even a game where luck is not on your side can make you feel that you accomplished something.  If you are a board gamer or know someone who is, I highly recommend picking up Armello.",

            "review_text": "Having watched this game through Early Access iterations and release, I can say that the game is fun and also that the devs care that it is in a good state.  HARDWARE GTX 970, Phenom II X6 @ 3.2ghz, 16gb RAM, SSD Mouse and Keyboard  Steam Controller -  Works great , see below.  Performance - The game never drops below 60FPS and looks great 98% of the time. Minor texture flickering may occur and occasional audio performance issues from using the newly released Steam Controlled and Big Picture mode it seems. The game is being constantly updated. I have experienced NMA (no more action) bugs only twice or so in my 74 hours of gameplay, some other minor bugs after its release from early access as well but the release is solid and you should not experience any real issues either. Netplay seems to work very reliably and has Steam integration for playing with friends.  Gameplay - Armello is more or less a tabletop board game where you control one of several semi-customizable heroes in your quest to be the new king. This is achieved by acruing the most prestige when the king dies of a magical corruption (or failed regicide), killing the king and surviving, or by collecting four artefacts required to cure him. You have several decks of cards with themes of equipment, magic, and subterfuge, which you can draw and play towards your goal. There's choices on how to progress your character, risks to weigh against rewards, and plenty of tussles to be had with the other players as you fight each other along the way. The thematics in this game are all wonderful, and the art, music, and visuals all contribute to the great presentation. The duration of a full-length online game is about 45-90 minutes depending on how long people take on their turns, and it can be less if a player achieves one of the other victory conditions,  But is it fun? I think so. The game has a strong element of RNG. Random board terrain, cards drawn, AI character movement, fickle dice rolls, and other players strangely unpredictable behavior all contribute towards making the game seem a crapshoot. One of the more prevalent complaints I have seen is how RNG heavy the game can be. But strategy does exist and a large part of it is being adaptive to the state of the game and trying to sway the odds in your favor. Knowing what decks to draw out of to try get the right cards you need, knowing what your objective should be for that phase of the game, and knowing what victory condition you should be working towards (and not just wandering the board aimlessly), these are all important and more. True, this isn't always going to work, but the game would probably be a lot more boring if every player was able to run consistent strategies, or only a few consistent strategies existed. The randomness of the game gives you more unpredictable 'oh-my-god that just happened' moments. It wont require any sort of grand strategy game knowledge to enjoy yourself either, so if you like to just play by the seat of your pants you can do that too. I think most importantly, if you can be a bit laid pack and not get upset over the outcome of a dice roll going completely wrong and maybe even losing you the game every now and then, you will have a good time.   All in all, its a great game. I've played 75 hours and loved them all, and I hope to play many more. There's been a lot of balance changes from Early Access up til now a few months after release and the devs do have an ear to the community for the most part. There's some more content on the way in the form of new characters as well, and maybe even some more content DLC down the line (I hope!). Its a good one. I'd recommend it.   -STEAM CONTROLLER-  Game works great with the Steam Controller! I would recommend my custom setup I have uploaded to the community profiles section, or you can read my suggested binding here. This arrangement lets you easily and quickly view player positions and keep an eye on the action. I put left click on the left side (unlike the default for steam controller) because it felt more intuitive to grab cards located on the left side of the screen that way.

            "review_text": "TL;DR- This game is awesome for the first couple of playthroughs. If you don't have friends to play with, playing the same game gets old very, very quickly. The lack of game types or customization destroys the replayability of this game, and therefore it's only a great game for the first few hours, and I would recommend spending your money elsewhere. I would definitely change my opinion if they opened up more options on customization to allow epic style games.  Looking at the graphics and the concept of this game, I was really pumped to get it. With that being said, I probably had higher expectations than what I should have going in. This game is a board game, plain and simple, and the first few playthroughs of the game that I had with each hero were awesome, since I learned the strengths and weaknesses of each hero, the randomness of cards and dice rolling, and the strategies of how to navigate the board as well as developing an overall strategy to win the game, on top of all of the 'randomness'. (Quests are random, with random bonus rewards, with a % chance to GET that bonus reward). All in all I really liked the luck aspect of the game balanced with the strategy aspect of the game, and the music and the artstyle really help making play the overall game fun, even if I feel that the AI turns take a bit longer than I would want to. Overall, the gameplay experience for the first couple of playthroughs was amazing.  With that being said, I tend to enjoy games where I can change the parameters around to make the game more interesting once I understand the and have a decent grasp of the games basic concepts. I've sadly grown fond of being able to change gameplay aspects due to modding. In custom games you can switch it up, but at the same time I would really enjoy being able to change more aspects of the game to get a different experience each time. For instance..  -I would love to be able to change the size of the map, or the amount of movement my hero can make on a turn. I'd really like there to be more than 2 maps to play on, since this gets very old, very fast.  -I would really like to be able to choose if I could equip more items on a hero. Having 3 helps with strategy, but I would love to get into crazy battles where I can have 8 or 9 dice with a few spells I could cast and extra cards to throw away.   -I would love to be able to purchase specific items or followers for a significant amount of gold to reduce the luck factor of a game. I've played a game where certain AI can get incredibly lucky early on with items and followers, and completely dominate the game. Purchasing a key item or follower for 10 gold or 10 magic would make the game feel less luck dependent, where at least I could have a chance at being able to augment my heroes strategy.   -I'd like to be able to choose in a custom game where only certain victory-types are allowed. Creating an epic long game without rot on the king just makes the AI go for a stones victory every time, versus a long drawn out game. I would also like there to be an option to be able to choose the amount of quests you can get before you are directed towards the king, so playing a longer game becomes viable.  Basically, without customization factors and with only 2 maps to play on, if you are not playing with friends, this game becomes pretty old, pretty fast. I guess I have a higher bar, since I'm used to playing games that allow modding, and that may not be fair, but there are many games out there with much longer staying power.",

Just like any game worth its salt, you can learn through loosing and win through experimentation and luck.  Once you have the mechanics of the game down, it's time to learn the cards and characters. Then you can formulate your strategy. Some players give a negative review of the game due to 'too many attack dice' being used- they just didn't pray hard enough to the RNGod is all. Dice are random, and you have to be able to take your losses if you want to play this game.

It's an interesting strategy game where you have to plan ahead, set your goals, and a blessing from RNJesus to bestow you a victory, but it's no real loss to lose-unless you're the type to get unreasonably salty about videogames, in which case I would advise you to turn off your computer and take a soulsearching walk through the park.  If I had to pick what I like so much about the game, it would have to be the attention to the lore, and even the characters, who all have different ways to say the predefined ways of talking. I rather appreciate how that IS the only way to communicate with other players, outside of messaging them personally after the game is finished. The visuals are stunning as well, and my only real regret is, one day I will have seen all of the cards, and I will be left wanting more of their interesting and frankly, entertaining visuals. The styles are wide and varried where they should be-the startup splash screen looks like a tapestry, battle animations are fun to look at, and the 3D models look and feel the part of the whimsical, but dark tabletop boardgame, and the UI and navigation is fun to gawk at whilst I plot against my friends.  I also appreciate how I can unlock things in the game-like the winter dice, but for those who wish to purchase things, they have a quick and easy option for that. No microtransactions here, and the DLC actually will add an entire clan to the runnings to switch up gameplay, which I can only hope, will add to the longevity of the game itself.  I confess that I don't know how particularly balanced everyone is, but since a solid part of the game is understanding what you want from the game and what direction you're going to take (as well as a sprinkle of luck), it is ultimately up to how good players are at, you know, playing the game. So while you might be really good at a character, there is absolutely no garuntee you'll win.  The music isn't bad either. It's fitting for the game, as are the sound effects. Standard animal midieval faire, and that's not really a bad thing whatsoever. I can't really find any real reason to pick at it, apart from me wishing that there was just a wee bit more variety. Who knows, maybe we'll get map packs in the future and that will change? I'd quite like that.  If I had any complaint, it's probably that if my connection cuts out, I can't rejoin a multiplayer game I was previously in.  All in all, a quality game with woodland creatures with its own lore and fleshed out world, and even though after the game, you put everything 'back in the box', there's still plenty of things to unlock to keep you going that adds fresh gameplay elements. I hope for more content in the future, as I said before, map packs would be really nice. More clans would be appreciated, and more unlocks for completing rounds of the game under specific conditions would also help keep the game 'fresh'. As for the small things, I do hope that they keep giving us more dice to unlock for specific times of the year, or certain events, because I appreciate those small things that keep me playing, or remind me to give it another go. Unlockable, but also payable skins for the characters would also be appreciated, but I can live without such frivolous squandering of funds, so long as we're getting more real content instead.",

I don't play it as often as I would like as it's one of those games I prefer to play with friends rather than with random strangers, but when we do manage to get a few games in we always have a lot of fun.   Armello is a board game brought to life in virtual form and it is done beautifully which is a credit to the developers as board games rarely convert well to a video game format. The game is set in a mythical fantasy kingdom of medieval animal characters, initially of which four were selectable but another four have been added since. There are four factions that represent different species, rats, rabbits, wolves and bears. The rat faction is home to charismatic sneaky types who suit the player that values cleverness and cunning (I always play as Mercurio for this reason) the rabbit faction is home to nobility who fare best at exploring and unearthing valuable artifacts, the wolf faction consists of brave warriors, suitable for players who value honour and battle and the bear faction consists of druids who suit players that prefer to use magic. All four factions and the characters who represent them are well balanced and give the game a good amount of variety in it's functionality.   The object of the game is to dethrone the corrupted King (who naturally is a Lion) and usurp the throne for your own faction. The land has been swept by an arcane sickness that has brought about large ravens that leave death and destruction in their wake, the corruption they spread is a blight that darkens the souls of creatures it touches, which is why the King must be dethroned. The game takes place across a day and night cycle which alternate every turn, each night the King takes a point of corruption which weakens his health but makes his ability to fight more devestating. There are four ways to win in Armello, you can kill the King yourself thus dethroning him in person, you can opt to be a little more guileful and gather prestige so that you are selected to be heir should the King die due to corruption rather than player intervention, you can collect four spirit stones that can be used to cure the King of corruption so he can be banished or you can gain as much corruption as possible through evil deeds which will give you a better chance at killing the King. As the game plays out you move freely around the board as many spaces each turn as your character abilities allow for, you collect cards that come in various forms that affect yourself, other players and the board in various ways. You can also opt to go on quests that come with their own rewards and add a good deal of role playing and flavour to the game. Should you come across an opposing player you can opt to battle them and if you do you get given the opportunity to burn any cards you don't want and each card will be converted into a dice that represents whatever burn ability the card had alongside it's own ability, this can come in the form of combat and various other things that will affect how the battles play out. There are honestly so many unique functions and things to do in this game that to go into all of them would take too much time, but for a game that lasts around an hour per session it really manages to suck you in and offer you a great deal of things to do without ever seeming too rules heavy or complex, which really gives it great appeal to both hardcore board game players and newcomers alike.  I really, really like Armello, it's a beautiful game with fantastic artwork, design and enough tactical depth to keep you coming back for more. I play a number of board games with friends and Armello has outstayed many of them, which is quite the feat for a virtual board game. If you have any interest in board style games at all or were just looking for something to play with friends and family I highly recommend Armello, it's quickly become one of my favourites.",

            "review_text": "Armello: Haphazard Regicide  Ever wanted to kill a king? No? Oh… Well, ugh, this is significantly more awkward, isn’t’ it? I guess– er, you know, forget I said anything.  So…Do you like anthropomorphic animals? Yes? Cool! Well… Remember that murder thing I mentioned…?  Armello is a pretty rad indie game that simulates a stellar board game experience. One that mixes elements from Table-Top, Pen and Paper RPGs, and a bit of MtG to make for a very unique experience. Armello is pretty simple to play once you get the hang of the game’s systems. But it’s fairly complex to explain… Despite a bit of a learning curve, this game is definitely worth the initial hump of “What the hell am I doing?”. Before we get into the nitty gritty, the main goal of Armello is to become the new Monarch. The current King has been stricken with an evil disease called ‘The Rot’. And as you would expect, he’s not doing so hot. Every night his condition worsens, and every day he inches closer to death. The Rot also affects his mind, sending him into madness. I feel bad for the guy.  Now, how does this relate to the player? Well, every win condition involves usurping him, either by waiting for him to die and taking his place. Or taking the throne through force. Heck, even the condition that involves purifying the King of his Rot kills him. So you need to get comfortable with the idea of regicide. Despite it’s appearance, Armello is a pretty dark and rough game.  The death of the King is the impetus, and the final goal, of your actions. Almost everything you do will revolve around this end goal. But the King is more of a passive piece on the board. He looms over the game, and carries out evil machinations, but never poses an immediate threat. What you have to look out for is the three other people all actively scheming, and advancing their own plots. You’ll be put in situations very regularly that involve you prolonging the King’s life in order to ensure you’re the one to end it. The enemy of my enemy and all that.  There are a lot of moving pieces in Armello. Four players all working towards a similar goal. With alliances and rivalries beginning and ending on a turn by turn bases. What might appear like help from another player is really just them protecting themselves. I’ll help you this turn to back stab you next turn.  Everything might be going exceptionally well on turn three, but by turn four the entire board state has changed and you must re-assess. It pays to think ahead, and have a plan, but it is invaluable to be able to adapt. There were many occasions where I was one turn away from winning, only to have it slip away from me when the AI pulled a total dark horse victory out of thin air.  How is this possible? Well, every player has a wide array of abilities that can, when used creatively, be applied to completely ruin another player’s day. There are pieces of equipment that increase your prowess in battle– making it easier to kill the King… or anything else. There are magic spells that give nasty status effects, such as: ending your turn prematurely, move you across the board, or possibly even killing you. And my personal favorite, traps. These can be anything from poison, killing companions, stealing their cards or gold, negating their equipment.. the list goes on. If you think through your actions, and use everything at your disposal, you can send someone in the lead into last place with one turn.  The order you do things in, and how long you wait to do it are incredibly important. On your turn you, usually, have three action points that allow you to do the various things at your disposal. Some take more than others… Simply moving three spaces can wreck havoc on another player. Scattered around the game’s map are little villages. If you move your character through them they will pay tribute to you in the form of gold. Without gold you can’t perform certain actions. Having three turns worth of set up be ruined because you’re short one gold is incredibly disheartening.  The swings in Armello are fast and hard. I’ve gone from first to last and back more than once over the course of a game. It’s never dull, and never boring. The pressure is almost always on. And the games are fast enough that you can play one over a lunch break.  Aside from killing the other players, there are also quests you can embark on that give various rewards. Sometimes the rewards can be game winning. Other times they can be a massive disappointment. But you’ll always walk away with some kind of a bonus, like an increase in your stats and Prestige. If the King dies of his Rot, the player with the highest prestige is the winner by default.  Armello really requires you to think, and demands a good bit a strategy. The games go by quick so your plans need to come to fruition sooner, rather than later. I find myself planning for the end game on turn one. “I want to win via killing the king”. And adapting my play towards whatever will actively further that goal.  It’s a good mix of long term and short term planning at the exact same moment. If you realize that things aren’t going your way, you need to adjust your strategy or risk losing. By the time you realize “things are bad” it’s almost too late. It’s as much about furthering your own ends, as it is interfering with everyone else’s. Because everyone’s position is so precarious, just a small bit of interference is enough to make someone target you the rest of the game…   “If I can kill the bear this turn, I’ll lower their prestige enough that when the king dies two turns from now I can win.” Or even better “Well… If I can’t win, you’re definitely not winning either.”  Armello is a very mentally stimulating experience… And I’ve only played with the AI. So I can’t speak for playing with humans. I have to imagine it’s a hundred times better. But, that’s one of the best parts of Armello. The AI is actually very good! Now, once I got really acquainted with the game I was able to out play the AI fairly easily. But they’re still definitely capable of einschrauben mich über, hardcore.  And on top of everything else I’ve mentioned here. The game has some seriously great artwork. It has a great storybook style to it that is simultaneously both lighthearted, and very dark. Watching a cute little rat solemnly hand over money to the king’s guards as they terrorize the townsfolk hits way harder than you’d expect. He’s not happy about it… but it has to be done.  Armello is awesome. It’s worth every penny. Seriously, support the Devs. If you like strategy, check it out. If you have friends, and want something to play together that doesn’t require a large time investment– Armello’s your game.  Buy it. I highly doubt you’ll regret it.

Play it in mulltiplayer, up your chances of getting neato dice skins even if you lose the match! I call that win-win.  I'm probably a weirdo, but I really enjoyed playing single player matches against the AI when I was beginning, just to figure out all the systems and such. Once I got a handle on things, I went multiplayer and saw how to really put the screws to my fellow players. Sometimes I even win!  The variety of characters also keeps the game from getting stale. Right now I'm really enjoying carrying around ridiculously huge hands of cards as Mercurio--but some months ago, I enjoyed being the undefeatable wolf fighter Thane. Lotsa different tactics here.  The devs do a lot to keep it fresh, too--I haven't yet paid for any DLC (though I plan to--Hello, Sargon.), but new cards, systems, and character chat have all been added for free--and those changes are enough to keep me coming back.  Do I have to mention that it's one of the best looking games around? The beautifully painted animated cards are great, the UI is lush, and battles look way cooler than rolling dice has any right to be.  It's not a fast-paced game (although if you're quick on the draw--or roll--you can help make it be!), but its atmosphere and variety are worth signing up for.",

Also since this game isn't finished at the time so this could be added. To tell the truth its so much fun to play that I don't really think of the cons as big deals.

It is not a couch party game (at least not yet) -- not sure if it would work or not since it has a stealth element.

I think it is a better version of Wizwar or Talisman (more stratedy and ways to win) though there is still some luck/badluck that can frustrate or make you jump for joy.  Overall, I have tried many Early Access games and many seem to progress very slow. I would put Armello at the top of the list for customer support, updates, dev team, ect. (alongside Brawlhalla); I am thoroughly impressed.  UPDATE: 7/15 -- Developers have continually patched multiplayer performance and added new cards and events to the game as free content and work on balancing the cost/values/stats of cards.

The graphics are great and the card animation is awesome. The characters are cool. One of the great things about this game is the replay value is good. I feel like I got my moneys worth. The gameplay is casual and nonstressfull, but still has in-depth stragety in the gameplay. I wish it had local play and more characters to choose from, as well as more card varity. You cannot discard from your hand, which can be frustrating in my opinion, cards in hand need to used or burned in combat and perils only.",

Very often the player who is best at adapting to unplanned circumstances will win. Twists at the end are very common. The game is more deep on tactics than it looks and the random factor of dice and car draws help in getting that board game feel the game tries to achieve.

            "review_text": "Armello 10/10 After playing 5 online matches and winning only one I strongly feel Armello is a thrilling, fun to play turn based strategy with RNG dice and cards, neat animations and captivating gameplay. You can lose miserably and still have lots of fun. You pick one of a cast of characters who have various starting stats and passive abilities and then level them up through quests placed on the map as the king in the middle slowly dies. The quests and various other activities like defeating players and monsters on the map give you prestige, the player with the highest prestige if the king dies of the curse wins the game, if someone kills the king and survives they win the game.    There's gold, magic, prestige, the stats, the cards (Equipment, spells, trickery cards and companions.) you can equip 3 equipment cards which usually cost you gold. The stats are fight(dice in combat.) body (health maximum.) Wit (card maximum and Peril resist) and Spirit (magic pool refresh value) There is stealth based on certain conditions like which character you are, what tile you're in and what equiptment you might have. Combat is resolved with dice and cards both.    There is a really low learning curve, but lots of tactics, and it's easy to make a poor choice until you get used to the game which adjusts the general new player curve to about medium. The game so far is pretty much meant for multiplayer competitive play, you can play single player while you're searching for a multiplayer match, much like other games of simular orientation.    10/10 for it's genre, I don't give 10/10 lightly, i don't take the time to review a game unless i am insanely impressed with the budget + quality ratio.",

A digital board game featuring lovable animal characters trying to dethrone a corrupted king and claim the throne for their clan. Mechanics are well thought out, and the game is regularly updated with new and improved systems to add additional depth while not making the game overly complex or confusing. There are multiple ways to win, which helps keep a single person from dominating the match, though the game is quite RNG-based, relying on dice rolling for battles, card drawing, procedurally generated board, semi-randomized quests, and a few other mechanics. Sometimes even with excellent strategy, the luck of the draw can't be overcome.  Still, an excellent game I never get bored of.   Game length: 1-2 hours  Pros: + Beautiful and unique style and graphics featuring anthropomorphic animals + Great soundtrack + Procedurally generated board means every game will be different + Multiple ways to claim victory, to stop a single player from dominating and blocking others from winning + Interesting and unique systems for combat, bounties, and 'traps' + Each character has a unique hero power that makes them different from other heroes + Each hero can be further customized to your playstyle with a selection of rings (exclusive to clans) and amulets (available to all heros) + 'Microtransactions' handled very well and very positively for everyone. Dice skins can be found in chests and traded or sold on the Steam market, which the Devs get a cut of when an item sells on the market. + Updated fairly regularly with new and enhanced systems + Devs are very attentive to bugs and glitches and do their best to solve them as soon as they can + Promotes public play with a chest and key system, in which both chests AND keys drop + Custom rule settings for private games + Can play a single-player match while waiting for a game (though queues are rarely very long), tab on taskbar will flash when you find a game while queued is you don't want to play singleplayer  Cons: - RNG-based, sometimes too much - Some hero's powers are almost useless, while others are very powerful - Private play doesn't give you keys or chests, making those who prefer to play only with friends unrewarded and left out (though the keys and chests only contain cosmetic dice skins, so it's not a mechanical disadvantage) - Currently a set of 4 exclusive Kickstarter heroes, though anyone playing in a private game with someone who owns them can use them, they can only be used in private games, and the Devs have stated they will be released as DLC for anyone to purchase eventually - Only way to communicate is through a set of 'commands', such as Hello, Good-bye, etc. No voice or text chat. - DLC is a little pricey, especially in comparison to the full game (the set of 4 DLC heroes is $10, 2 board skins are $5).",

Playing a game, you feel like you always have a chance to win it, even if there are setbacks. There is enough strategy to keep your brain in it, and enough luck that it doesn't get repetitive. Basically, the game itself is awesome.  The Bad: It crashes. A lot. There have been days where I've had four games crash in a single day, due to reasons like someone quitting the game - more often than not, that locks up the game for all of the other players. This wouldn't be that bad, if it didn't happen afte you'd already invested 45 minutes into a multiplayer match. Don't take my word for it - go to the discusson forums and the Bug section. It's the same problem, hundreds of times. Every time, they ask for bug reports, but there's no solution. When I have reached out to the developers for assistance myself, they've said the same thing, asked for bug reports and game logs, which I've provided, on numerous occasions. Then nothing happens. The issues are never fixed.  Even this wouldn't be that bad, except that they keep releasing DLC. It's like they're building additions onto a house with no foundation. Also, they're parting out cosmetics like they're trying to turn this $20 game into a $60 release. I get that no one has to buy extra dice or seasons, but it's infuriating that they seem to have the development time to push this stuff out, but not fix the very serious game breaking bugs that have been in here since the very beginning.  I have about 250 hours in this game, so obviously there is a lot to enjoy. But I don't recommend you buy it until you start seeing posts here about these issues being resolved.

People talk about luck when it comes to this game. Well, isn't real life a game of luck? We all have to deal with what cards we're dealt in life. And that's what it all comes down to, how smart, how strategic can you be with the cards you are dealt?  And can you accept how the die roll? That's LIFE PEOPLE, LIFEEEEE.  Anyways, enough life talk, let's talk about the game.  This game is not entirely down to luck, you can be smart about what you're given. Sometimes, you really will be cornered. But the thing is, everyone starts each game at square one. No one is OP, (at first) and the game can change in your favor or anyone elses. You can sabotage others and they can sabotage you. To me, that's very fair.  The die in this game are not pre animated, they physically roll as they should in real life, and they are completely random because of this. To me that's as fair as it gets.  If you're the type of person who cannot accept the fact that sometimes things don't go your way, then this game may not be for you. If you like the thrill of the risk, the fun that can be had by the fact anything could happen at anytime and you just might have the resources to counter anything against you, then this is for you.  The graphics are great, the music is great, it's easy to pick up and learn if you just play through the tutorial and try one single player game, you'll have a grasp of the whole thing.  This is highly recommended by me, it's incredibly fun, quite tactical and just plain good.  As an Early Access game, there are bugs. They don't happen often at all. But there were only 2 instances where 2 of my friends couldn't finish their games. All other times have been good. There's also a terrific built in bug reporting system for these instances as well.

Armello's focus on both random and non-random events to determine the winner of a game reminds me heavily of how Hearthstone can be played. In certain cases with Hearthstone, an individual card draw may win the game. However, there is always the aspect of deck building and card play order which can provide the stronger influence. Armello's strength by contrast, lies in the building of your hero's stats, equipment and buff usage throughout the game. As a result, Armello avoids the pay to win mentality of Hearthstone.  An argument I disagree with is that Armello can be criticised over its choice of unlockable perks for playing the game, which can potentially disadvantage newer players in the multiplayer environment. Firstly, a new player in multiplayer is far more at a disadvantage for lack of knowledge about the game mechanics than anything else. If a person plays a game without a strategy as to how they are going to win, they are very unlikely to do so. Secondly, the unlockable perks can be so minor in their impact, that they will not affect gameplay anywhere near as much as strategy or a good random draw.  TLDR: Armello is an excellent cross between Monopoly and Heroes of Might and Magic. The games are relatively short. It's not pay to win like Hearthstone. A good strategy is the most likely way you will win a game.",

The trick then is to be able to revise your plans immediately and go for a new victory condition, if that one seems more plausible than your old one. Also, sadly, a lot of online games I've playe so far are marred by people disconnecting. But that's a problem with the player base.

You don't have to put much time into this game to be powerful, don't have to worry that you can't catch up with others after leaving the game once a while. Just play with people whenever you want. You need skills and luck to win, neither devotion nor pay to win.  Move three cells each turn, draw a number of cards base on wit. Cards can be equipments, useable items, spells, traps, etc. Finish quests to gain more stats and rewards. Three ways to kill king, or win with prestige. Every character has their own special ability. Each clan has their unique rings. As a result, strategy is diverse. You can speed up AI in option, and push . button, to speed up AI further, too. In multiplayer, people uses strategies that you never see with AI. I learned a lot in multiplayer.  For those who complains about randomness. I have played so many turn-based strategy games, a few notable are heroes series, Xcom series, talisman, Elder Sign, Hard West, King’s Bounty, etc. I tend to play on highest difficulty and get boring because it is too easy. In Armello, I win 70-80% against AI because of randomness and I enjoy it. I won’t play this game if I know how to win 100% every time.  Multiplayer is where the real challenge begins. Where you feel anxious and tense, the intense pleasure, a kind of addiction. The stimulation is too good...You don’t want to go back to single player anymore.  Conclusion: A Hidden gem. Must play.",

Far too often, within the first 2-3 turns, it's already obvious which one or two players will actually have a chance at winning, while the other two or three players got screwed by RNG. This would be OK, in a game that takes an average of 30 minutes. But to have zero chance of winning over half the time due to bad luck just ten minutes into a one-hour game is just not my idea of fun or enjoyable. For this game to be what it could be, they need to find a way to drastically cut down on the snowball effect, or give players more control over their fate. One idea I can think of is to add a deck-building component, where players can choose which cards will be available to them, so as to be more likely to draw cards that work together and help a specific build; think MTG.",

            "review_text": "An addictive digital board game that will usurp the dwindling hours of the night that, foolishly, you thought you could spare. Play til 10pm, because of work the next morning? Why not, instead, zone out and play until it is 3am and lazily muffle a curse out of your lethargic lips when you realise you sacrificed a good nights sleep for a few hours of strategic maneuvers under the fate of a dice roll. Then, whilst you prepare to sleep, you can debate the role and function of free will and determinism, or just god damn luck based compatibilism. However your argument pans out, be sure as you're going to be grumpy in the morning, that at least Armello was saved from a King ridden with Rot.   Until you play again. But of course, only until 10pm.   The mechanics of the game work seamlessly, and the fluid deck building dynamic adds individuality into each game ensuring a reasonable element of uniqueness for each session of kingdom saving joy.   The writers have clearly gone into great length into writing stories for the optional (and recommended) quests that you perform each game, but I fear that those poor scribes have worked in vain, for it is not a story dependent game (however, I for one found it extremely charming, and appreciate the effort - it's just that it is not integral to the actual joy of the game. If you are to take my opinion on this matter, you must take in stock that I have read most, if not all, of the in-game books from the Elder Scrolls series, Morrowind and up. What am I doing with my life? God knows, but ‘He basically read meta-fiction in games and enjoyed manly solitary one-handed pleasures’ wouldn't be the most untruthful epitaph I'd have scribed on the marble above me)  I would say it is a short lived novelty game, and I don't think I'd be completely wrong. I have stacked up 50 hours on this sucker in a short amount of time though, and that is due to the relatively small time you need to invest into any single game. It is by this virtue that makes it a remarkable digital board game. Hell, if you were of the creatively productive type, you could fashion tiles out of cardboard, make painted clay figurines, print out cards, make some dice, and successfully play this with offline friends (there was a time in humanity where we socialised amongst fleshy alterations of ourselves, believe me or not. Back then, we just called those people 'friends'. But they became tiresome and didn't have numbers or pop cultural references in their monikers, and their avatars were what we called 'faces').   Basically, you choose between four different species (Bear, Wolf, Rabbit, Rat), who in turn, have two variations that centre on their particular strengths and abilities (Wizard, Warrior, Diplomat, Rogue). With that, you choose stat perks and bonuses. Then you're thrown into the game. You compete with three other souls to try focus on one of the game victory conditions. It's not too difficult to grasp, but would be redundant to type here as it is explained competently in the game description and the developers website (which is charming in itself, I implore you to explore it yourself).   Either way, cracking game in its simplicity and its uniqueness. Go have at it.  Or don't.   I'd rather you did though. Needs more players active for multiplayer, and I don't have the time and energy to replicate a physical board game, nor acquire friends.   Enjoy, you magnificent people.   For Armello.  ",

You could easily double the pace of play without feeling like things are going too fast, and the AI is often pretty poor. I have played multiple games with AIs starting fights they can't win and feeding other AIs. If this is intentional, to make the game harder for the player, there have to be better ways to increase the challenge. If it is not intentional then the programming is poor. In either case it's frustating to sit through.  Most of my gripes about Armello boil down to things that are really related to the game play itself. As a board game Armello would be very fun, but as a video game it's clunky, slow, and tedious. If you can get past all of that then give it a try, but otherwise I would avoid spending more than $5 on it.",

The art is.. alright, and the sound is less than what I expected it to be.  The gameplay is fun and charming in a niche way the first, second, and third time around - and then it gets to be repetitive and extremely predictable. The games in my opinion feel rushed and offers a very low skillcap, with much of your progress based on luck.   I hope sincerely that content patches bring this game forward by leaps and bounds because as it stands now, it is not worth what I paid for it I'm sorry to say. From the gamebreaking multiplayer bugs, lackluster texture work and general underwhelming game size, this feels more like a free to play title.  I can't wholeheartedly recommend buying the game, because it's simply asking too much to pay $20 for what feels like a game that took two or three months to make (And I have the developer experience to know what work goes into these things.)",

            "review_text": "I saw great promise in Armello when it was first launched on Kickstarter--so much so, that I became an immediate backer of the project. I actively followed its development and, as an early backer, was able to have hands-on time with the early access versions of the game before its launch. Armello has now been released as a completed product for the masses, but despite really wanting to like Armello, I must be honest and say that I feel lukewarm overall.  As a note, I am a fan of Euro-style board games (IE: Catan, Carcassonne, Terra Mystica, etc.) where strategy plays a larger role in determining victory. Player tactics in these sorts of board games are what make them more involving, although, sometimes at the cost of a higher learning curve. Armello falls closer towards the opposite end of the spectrum and positions itself as a more casual and family friendly style of board gaming (IE: Risk, Monopoly, LIFE, etc.) where luck plays in tandem with a light layer of strategy.  Armello, however, leans its gameplay tactics a bit too much on luck. Randomization and dice rolls are a significant portion of the games mechanics and include:     Randomized card draws    Randomized quest locations    Randomized outcomes for quest items    Randomized dungeon exploration outcomes    Randomized spawning of banes and spirit stones    Dice rolls for battle outcomes    Dice rolls for peril outcomes   As a result, whatever semblance of strategy a player attempts in Armello is unfortunately negated a great majority of the time. The most well laid of plans will be foiled due to mere chance, not an opponent's cunning. I hope that subsequent updates can improve and address the strategic involvement, but as it stands, Armello is currently only good for the occasional, light-hearted game. I have a feeling it will resonate with those who are expecting it to be as such, but for those players expecting a board game that involves deep strategization and tactics, I recommend looking elsewhere or sticking to the tried and true classics.  Edit: I have replayed this recently after multiple patches. Armello remains more of a luck-based board game rather than a strategy-based board game. To be clear, this is not to say that Armello does not have strategic elements. It does, but it is in rather light doses. Most of the action involves mitigating uncontrollable circumstances arising from luck. Again, if you are more fond of Euro-style board games like I am, then this is not the game for you. However, it is perfect fun as a casual board game.",

            "review_text": "TLDR: Recommended ONLY if it is on sale for 50% or so, or if you are a fan of playing board games with family/friends. Very pretty game that can be quite engaging the first times you play it. However, stay clear if you are not a fan of 'luck based' games, if you just want to singleplay to play it everyday AND if you expect to win every session. That won't happen.    Full review: It can be horribly unfair, or it can be downright cake walk, like a lot of board games out there this game will really test your luck.  Sometimes you may start out with a lot of gold, thus you then would base your play method on playing a lot of trick cards to troll the other Heroes while you focus on getting prestige or something else.   Other times you may get a very rare and strong equipment cards, to the point where (as it happened to me on one session) in a few turns you could get a combo that gives you 9 shields at the start of every battle, making you pretty much unkillable in that way (they can still kill you with spells/traps/etc however).   And other times... well, you may get killed before the next dawn over and over. Traps, unlucky dice rolls, getting quest objectives that are on the other side of the map of where you are... and maybe then the King and his 'favorite' Hero will decide on next turn to strip you off all your cards or gold! Fun times indeed.  No single game session is the same, which is actually a good thing since it won't feel repetitive too fast gameplay-wise, and the game uses a card system for your items and spells, and they all come with animated pictures which are overall beautiful to look at. Overall, the art and design of this game is its best aspect in my opinion.  Unfortunately, it does get repetitive on other areas. For example, the game is really lacking on type of 'tiles' for the map (maybe something like water tiles which take 2 AP but make you immune to spells? or maybe something like a Dungeon-Fort that awards you with an item/card if you manage to defeat a strong enemy in it? just a few examples out of my mind right now), and on map diversity as well, with there only being 2 map types (normal and winter, which are only for asthetic porpuses), it really gets dull fast and it really feels like more could have been done with these aspects.  Length of each session is what I believe 'enough'. The game has a sort of turn limit since each day the King will get weaker and weaker until his health is depleted which ends the game session unless someone kills/banishes the king before that. This usually takes about 20 turns or so and overall each session tends to last about 2-3 hours depending on how fast players play their turns. After playing it for a while (say, 7-8 full game sessions) it will probably become too repetitive on its visuals, but gameplay should still feel fun and fresh every time you play, especially if you play with other people rather than the AI.  Nice game with evident flaws, but nothing that cannot be polished on future updates. And even if they aren't, its still a good game to play once every now and then especially with other people as you would with any board game.",

I originally Kickstarted it way back when, and it remains one of the very, very, few games that I do not regret Kickstarting.  Things I love most about Armello:  1 - The visual design---especially character design---is phenomenal. At one glance, even if you're not familiar with the game, you can guess how a character plays. Thane (wolf with sword) is an offensive combat character. Barnaby (bunny with giant hammer and armor) focuses on equipment and combat. Elyssia (who is the best design character of all IMO) is a builder. The king's a lion, and his guards are faithful dogs. All the playable characters ooze personalities, kind of like a dark fairy tale Overwatch. This is actually the reason why I Kickstarted it.  2 - Just like how games like Hearthstone does things that CCGs not played on a computer can't do, Armello does the same with boardgames. Things that would be too tedious to keep track of or involve secrecy that's impossible in tabletop play can happen easily here. Some people view that as a bad thing because it means that hotseat Armello will never happen (the devs confirmed this). I find that a plus because with Armello as a hotseat / physical game it means it's slightly easier to choose a board game when I'm playing with friends.  3 - It's just a really good board game. I'm not a super board game geek (case in point, I don't even have a Boardgamegeek account) but I've played my fair share of games. And Armello is definitely in the top 10 of my favorite games. Maybe even top 5. The mechanics are interesting and mostly balanced (yes even that stupid bear with his spells). And it makes me say 'mmm this is clever' both on plays and mechanics quite often.  Biggest problems with this game are game length and NMA (no more action, essentially game ending bugs). It takes an hour or two to play a game with 3 human opponents, and while you can do things offturn things do get slow. I often multitask while playing, which I like but may or may not be a plus for you. The NMA bugs are annoying, especially given the game length, but I've only gotten them in 1/10 games in the past and haven't seen any since a few months ago (after the War chest update). The devs clearly love the game and update it pretty often with bugfixes and new content, so I'm pretty happy.",

I've noticed that in battle the opponent will get many many more rolls of the dice than I will - not that they'll have more dice to start with, but they'll get more Wylds (or rots, if it's a Bane) and more appropriate suns/moons, and more shields. Basically, even though we'll start out with a respectable number of dice each, when it comes down to what hits land and what shields go up, the AI will generally be massively better off than I am. This is not to say that I expect to win every time, but there's a difference between being outplayed and being just ripped off by the RNG. It takes the fun out of the game.  It's worth noting that the randomness everywhere else in the game seems even - the quests are spread out, the dungeons yield a fair spread, and so on.

            "review_text": "Armello is, quite simply, an incredibly well designed game.  It's basically a digital card game / board game hybrid which combines strategic decision making and multiplayer bluffing and politics with a moderate degree of randomness. Yes, most actions in the game are determined by dice rolls but if you use your cards efficiently this can be mitigated to such a large extent that the victor is nearly always determined by strategic play rather than luck (I personally have around a 70% win rate at the time of writing and trust me, I'm not that lucky) .On balance the gameplay works extremely well and creates interesting situations with a surprising amount of replayability. Armello is by no means a game which you binge all day every day (although you could if you wanted to) but it's fantastic for a couple hours of laid back fun every now and then.  The game has a theme and art style which somehow immediately reminded me of the Redwall books I used to read when I was younger. It's somewhat cartoony but in an extremely polished, non-comical way. The 8 different characters that can be played all have different playstyles and are, on the whole, surprisingly well balanced. Many CCGs released these days could actually learn a lot from Armello in terms of game balance because the same is true for the cards in the game. Even cards which are less obviously useful and might sit dead in your hand for a turn or two can still be 'burned' for beneficial effects in combat or in perils (traps basically).  The only criticisms I have are that there are still a few bugs here and there (the most annoying one being a bug that freezes the game when a player gains AP using Strategist or Hot-Rot Wine when it's not their turn) and that ranked mode has still not been implemented.  This is a real shame as the game definitely has the player base to support it. The amount of players seems to have actually gone up significantly since the game was released on Steam and it rarely takes longer than half a minute to find a game at the time of writing.  Overall, highly recommended.",

            "review_text": "Armello is a thematic combination of Game of Thrones and Redwall and as a digital board game its very hard to not enjoy each of your turns as there's almost always something you can do. It is a very polished and enjoyable game. That said I do have some things that bother me about it.  It becomes slightly tedious watching each other players' turns at the same speed as you take yours and the veiw limitations of the game board seem strange when veiwing through a large monitor. This essentially means you are spending 3/4 of your time playing the game watching your opponents (if you can even see them).   While it is valuable that you pay attention to what your opponents do, sometimes it becomes a chore. The other issue is how the board will not allow you to zoom out and see more of it, and when you try it becomes blurry and unfocused. This defeats the purpose of the board game style.  Another issue is that there are far to few settings for video customization. Personally I find it especially irksome that there is no borderless windowed mode.  I am eagerly looking forward to any DLC or changes that they make to this game to improve on these faults and polish this gem of a game, however so far the developers have made no effort to rectify these issues I've mentioned. In fact I have been told they refuse to remedy the zooming veiw issue, citing that it is done on purpose to force players to use the ridiculously close zoom.",

I'm glad I didn't refund. Armello is a complete change of game genre for me. It can be relaxing at times and I love the artwork.

There are always 3 opponents (human or AI controlled) along with a variety of NPCs that hinder or help your progress. Being tasked with returning the kingdom to normal, you can choose to defeat the king in combat, become more corrupt than him by being tainted by the 'rot', gather 4 spirit stones to banish him or become the prestige leader and keep the king alive. The different heroes you play as all have their own talents and skills. Each clan has their own rings and coupled with the trinkets and artifacts you uncover during the game you can have a wildly varied hand. At first it seems easy but there are many things out to get you. You have to face perils, survive enemy players and mobs and get close enough to the king to stop him. I love the aesthetics of this game, it certainly feels and sounds like a fantasy adventure you'd want to be a part of. The animal motif fits the theme and the range of cards and effects makes this a deeply complex game. Definitely one of the best board games on Steam.",

Given that I can, I can recommend the game on the condition that you speed up the AI turns. That said, I think either it should default to sped up, or it should suggest in game that it's an option, because without it turned on, it's painfully slow...and I have a fast PC. :)",
