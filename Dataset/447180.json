            "review_text": "Another port from mobile, this time with pets turning into humans! Disregard my little play time, as I had already purchased and read Assam's, Ramin's and Lufna's routes. In this otome the overarching narrative can only be understood if all the routes are played, as each gives a clue towards the final mystery, with Reito's route being the most spoilery of them all. Don't expect the supernatural element to be explored much, as the focus is in the romance. The narrative, while decently cute and with some steamy scenes sprinkled here and there, feels a bit superficial, maybe because the whole story takes only a week to develop. The chapters are also shorter. It's a light, sweet read. The MC is bearable for otome standards, but not the best out there. At least she has friends, and Yosuke and Sachi are a decent support cast. Also, for once it's not a high-school MC, she already goes to university. Yay for something catered to us grannies, although the general level of maturity of the characters is far below what the setting would suggest. I really liked the artstyle, there is a good amount of CGs and the MC has eyes in all of them, which is always a plus considering the mobile origins of this game (but the guys have no nips :&lt;). The music is okay, few tracks that fit a variety of moods. The very first is probably my favorite. Since sequels and special scenarios are included as well, it's well worth the price if you're looking for a light read with slice of life/romance as focus and some supernatural. But exactly because the narrative is so superficial, it can be a hit or miss, so I'd suggest to try out the Android/iOS version first (prologue and first chapter of each characters are free).",

            "review_text": "Bought it yesterday and played it for like 50 minutes... I was hoping for a light and happy otome game, instead i bought a depressing game about a breakup(that the characters seems to talk about it nonstop) and something like all the characters except the one you'll love will die in one week. It's just too serious. Oh well, at least there's some sexy guys and sometimes the things get spicy XD",

            "review_text": "It's my favourite Dogenzaka Game.   I played most of their games and while I enjoyed most of them, My secret Pets really surprised and pleased me. It's one of those games where you don't get a bad ending.  For me it's a little frustrating to have story pathes where it's impossible to get a good or at least neutral ending (like a certain path in Destinys Princess)... so, I'd say My secret Pets is for anyone who enjoys a lighthearted and little touchy story.   It is recommended to play the pathes in order, though, to prevent some spoilers, as the stories lead to a final conclusion.",

            "review_text": "I'm giving this one a tentative up. I really do wish their was a middle ground in reviews. I don't think it's terrible and I have to give them props for constructing the game to tell a larger, more complicated story then just who the heroine will get with. That said, I don't think it quite works, but I still enjoyed the game and don't regret the time I spent with it.  If you're familiar with any of Dogenzaka Lab's other Otome games then you'll know what you're getting into like a romance novel from the 80s or early 90s the guys tend to be jerkwads, the protagonist is meek and/or a crybaby and the drama train rides right to the last screen. This one does have a couple of routes where the guys are actually pretty damn nice so that's a refreshing twist.  I'd honestly recommend this on sale if you're curious and/or want to enjoy the lovely art and an interestingly weaved plot. If you're interested in the larger overall plot I recommend this reading order:  Lufna, Ramin, Assam, Reito and Lize. You can probably change up Lize and Reito on preference without too much story dissonance, since they both reveal the most major plot twists, but tell distinctly different sides of the story.   If you don't care that much then just go through the screenshots on the store page and read the description one and go for the archetype that works best for you. I personally loved Lufna and Ramin's routes and thought Assam was interesting even though I think they didn't quite know what to do with him.   ",
