            "review_text": "The production values went up a lot, but the gameplay itself is almost completely identical to The 7th Guest. It starts out with an almost fifteen minute long stupid montage that looks like it was ripped straight out of some mid-90s made for tv movie where some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on a motorcycle rides a motorcycle and reminisces about the hot babe he seduced and then got mad at for some reason and told her he wished she'd die or disappear.  Spoiler: She dies or disappears into the house from the first game, which is in more or less the same state as it was in the first game, just with evidence that some ♥♥♥♥ stumbled around dropping puzzles everywhere. And to be honest, I would rather play this game, if I had to play one of these, but that's mostly because this game allows you to fast travel around the house. But that's also a problem in its own way because, again, this is just a series of disconnected puzzles that have nothing to do with each other, so we have to wonder why they even bother with the wrapper of the computer generated mansion or the threadbare plot or anything at all.  I guess the answer is that games were still mostly just a novelty at the time and we let ourselves get caught up in the power of the CD drive, allowing for games that weren't really games at all to slip through the cracks. But it's clear that a lot of the novelty of this style of game had already slipped away in the two year span between 7th Guest and 11th Hour because this game just seems pretty quaint and forced in comparison. That probably has a lot to do with my lack of nostalgia for this, but I guess that's just the way she goes. I've played worse, but I think that looking back at this series it's pretty easy to see about a dozen games (it struck me while I was writing this how similar, in essence, this series is to the Professor Layton games, for example) that have done what it tried to do so much better.",

            "review_text": "I couldn't imagine it getting any worst with the sequel to 7th Guest. Yet it somehow did.  The insults from the narrator is amplified now. This means, each time you reset a puzzle, Stauf gives a little witty reply. The navigation UI is also worst now, as it is more difficult to choose between moving and observing. This is reinforced by the treasure hunting objective they've added in. You'll be waving your cursor around at every single corner of the house you can possibly click on.  Remember how the word puzzles in 7th Guest supported the story in a sequence. Well forget about those. It’s been replaced with a slew of anagrams of the hidden item you need to find. Where are the items? Well there’s no hint for that, you still have to wander around till you find it, hence the treasure hunting part of this adventure. What’s even worst is the item you need to find is not targetable until you solve some puzzle elsewhere. So, you're back to randomly waving your cursor around until it pops up.  Is there any relevance with puzzle to the hidden item? Nope.  Can you complete the puzzle associated with future content before ever getting the anagram for it? Yup.  This spaghetti mess of a design just doesn't make any sense on paper nor in practice.  On the plus side, the hint button for the puzzles is on hand at all times from the menu system, instead of being in the library... if that's any consolation of the headache of trying to find where you need to go.",

            "review_text": " Cons:  - Navigation is painful (you can skip the animation but since '7th Guest' sometimes showed something special when you looked around, I'm afraid to miss something if I skip them all). - Many items and paths can't be selected until you 'unlock' them, even though they look exactly the same as when they were 'locked' (e.g. you can't go through a  partially opened  door until you solve some riddles/puzzles). - Several hotspots can be missed just because the game tends to hide it from your sight when you explore. While exploring can be part of the gameplay, forcing you to have the worst point of view (since you have very limited freedom of movement) is just a cheap and annoying trick. Some examples: * the cash register hidden behind the bed * putting your face right against the doors when you move on the first floor, while you expected to get just a bit closer to them and see the area around. - One puzzle (at least) has a bug : the cash register (again), which has several possible solutions but refused the one I first tried even though it was correct. And that's the very first puzzle of the game. - Riddles hardly make sense. I can see what they tried to do, but the logic behind is very weak. Quite a problem for a puzzle game. - Puzzles are only moderately interesting and some are terribly designed. For instance: * the modern painting coloring puzzle where you can barely see the painting * puzzles that involve playing against the bad guy don't clearly show when it's your opponent's turn. He plays at full speed, without a pause or speech, even though any other event in the game is very slow and often include some speech. I only realized I was playing against someone after checking the help system. - Sound balance is terrible: some voices are way too low compared to the music, some are louder for no reason. The game manual mentions that you can adjust the voice/music balance but it's probably broken as I didn't notice any change when I tried. There are no subtitles, also, which makes some dialogs very hard to get (for a non-native english speaker at least). - Some voices are very badly edited. For instance, at the end of one of the riddles, you can clearly hear the guy add 'but...' before being cut abruptly (I suppose the sentence had to be shortened after it was already recorded). - The game usually doesn't recover after you alt-tab to another application.   Pro:  - The cheesy videos, featuring cleavage shots and a braless girl.   Conclusion:  I'm playing it like I played '7th Guest': because they were both considered special at their time of release, I never got to play them then and I want to see what it was about. I'm still at the beginning of the game and already using a walkthrough to only focus on the puzzles and skip all the pointless wandering.",
