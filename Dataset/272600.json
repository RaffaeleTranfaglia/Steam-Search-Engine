The story is exciting and it simply keeps you captivated throughout the 2-3h of gameplay.  All the characters are well designed, interesting and full of surprises. Some of the dialogues are funny and witty, adding an extra flavor to this already nice game.  The few puzzles that you need to solve in order to progress through the story are rather basic (each can be solved in less than 1 minute), but the cute cartoonish graphics and the decent voice acting easily compensate for this.

            "review_text": "Short Review:  A nice investigation 'point &amp; click' game with high quality voice acting behind it and very detail animations, with a very unique style that reminds of Professor Layton, Zelda Windwaker, and old-style cartoons of the 50s. If anything, the game lacks depth and it's rather too short, and the final part of the game is very disappointing since it does everything for you. Worth a check, considering the low price point.  Long Review:  Detective Grimoire is technically the second game of the series, with the first being released as a free flash game on their site (which is still pretty good in my opinion! Give it a check!). However, with this game they did a HUGE leap of quality, adding a ton of stuff that the original game didn't have, such as voice acting (A LOT of voice acting) better animation, different art style and more complex puzzles (but not as complex as they should be really).  Initially released for portables such as iPads and what not, I was anticipating this game for a long time, as I loved the original DG for being quite interesting, and the character is actually very likeable and very funny; what we have here is basically a port that didn't suffer from it and still maintains its core mechanics, such as the 'theory-maker' thingie.  If anything, the resolution cannot be changed, and the volume is at max by default: little nitpicks, so nothing to worry about.  The game itself is splendidly made: dialogues are fun to follow and don't drag too much, as they flow very fast and I rarely skipped the dialogues, since they were very interesting and very funny (especially Grimoire: he really tells a lot of stupid things. Oh, and they made the hat joke again!). The puzzles are ok, but just too easy to follow: the real challenge at times is the Theory-making part, since at times you'll put the wrong statement...but at the same time, it's a lot of fun to mess up those, making him say the dumbest thing ever. The game is fluid and has also animated cutscenes as well, and the characters are...okay, for the most part.  However, there are some issues in my opinion: for one, the story is good, but the last part is a joke: you do nothing at all when you catch the culprit, and that's a huge disappointment considering that the first game, a flash game, had a far more complicated part where you EVEN have to guess who did it. In here, he picks it up for you. The game is also too easy: you really can't fail anything at all, and as soon as you get your clues you can just spam them to the suspects and see their reaction...and Grimoire even tells you 'when it's time to go'. They also gave you the possibility to see if something is suspect or not on a culprit, but it's completely useless and serves no purpose: it's just there for letting you check your progress to catch the culprit. And let's face it, you'll guess who it is pretty soon.  I honestly hoped the game to be more intriguing: the art is amazing and the game is very fun, but the story behind is disappointing and lacks to be intriguing, which is a huge problem for me.  Still, I do recommend this game, because it's always good to have nice adventure games and the game is still VERY well done.  Avoid it if you don't care about investigation, reading, or point and click adventures in general.",

Over the course of the game you learn about nine potential suspects (including the deceased) and meet a few helpful characters besides. The dialogue is succinct, humorous and well voice-acted -- I loved every voice in the game. The jokes are well-timed and the characters do not miss a boat. Beat.  The detective (Grimoire) keeps ample notes on objects, places, and items (with only the occasional misspelling), so that you do not spend time trying to find out about something you already know. Characters also (helpfully!) remember what you have asked them about -- greying out those choices so you do not find yourself repeating the same questions over and over. (Of course you CAN ask those questions again if you wish).  There are a few exceedingly simple puzzles scattered throughout the game. I do not think they add much, but they also do not detract much.   The mystery itself is ho-hum, but the journey of exploring and talking to the loveable cast of characters makes this game worth a look. I found myself smiling and laughing as I played, and I do not regret the purchase. Great for an evening's entertainment.",

Overall it's not the usual Point'n'Click. It's entertaining and has it's moments, but it doesn't offer the same kind of drama you'd expect from a murder mystery.

The smart gameplay with tons of humor, leading-edge puzzles, gut-busting kind of narration with nifty voicing quality makes this game super-awesome (two thumbs up here!!!). All the characters are so adorable and the soundtracks are perfect especially for those lovers of mystification (whooaah!).  What I love the most about this game is that youâ€™re playing as a detective (Detective Grimoire) whoâ€™s very keen in solving a murder case by a weird green creature (Boggy). The characters are like those in cartoon network due to its flamboyant style, environment, art, and graphics. Excellent interface! The puzzles are not that staggering and can be unlocked through common sense and comprehension as the game is progressing.   I would say that you should try this flashy game! As you meet various characters through playing the conundrum, clues and evidences will also be unveiled which will bring you up together the pieces and linking it with all that youâ€™ve discovered to formulate judgment or conclusion. Sounds interesting, right? (Hehe!)  The only thing that I felt disappointed about is that the game was too short. I was expecting of a more story rich game especially with its great quality (waaaahh).  Overall, beautifully presented! I would surely RECOMMEND this game. Itâ€™s worth the play! Still waiting and hoping for its sequel and I might as well find and marry this indie developer (guy?! haha!). Seriously, one of my favorites!",

The gameplay area consists of less than twenty different locations around the bayou, but is stuffed full of memorable characters to converse with and lots of clues to discover.  Detective Grimoire has obviously been designed for tablets, but the game transcends its origins simply by not dumbing down stuff needlessly. Sure, the game is not terribly hard since its designed for people of all ages to enjoy, but you do need to use your brain to actually make conclusions based on the evidence you're presented with. For the most part, it feels like you're doing real detective work instead of just solving random puzzles.  Production values are high as well, with fitting music, good writing, marvelous voicework and a rather unique, painterly graphics style that reminds me a bit of Day of the Tentacle. Overall, everything fits together really well, and it's maybe even a bit hard to fully appreciate the game because of how completely slick it is.

Pretty and painterly + Doesn't entirely give away the 'bad guy' -- you still have to guess at the end + Voice acting is nice.

There's no real consequences or difficulty. - The map is difficult to naviagte - The voice acting can be horrible at times, and sometimes poorly compressed.  The characters are quirky. But that's it. There's no depth, and you don't really care at all about them as people. They're just quirky, one-note characters.  I actually finished 90% of the game without meeting one of the MAIN suspects (and, turns out, the actual perpetrator.) I was probably supposed to meet said person before this point, but the game did not lead me to this person at all. I was using the map to travel, and jumped right past them. I could not figure out what I was doing wrong, everything was at 100% except a big BLANK spot. Ended up having to look up a guide.  The rest of the game was just...made for a kid. It's not that difficult, and some of the 'puzzles' are so easy I questioned if I had this game on a weirdly low difficulty level.

And given that I finished it with 100% in under three hours, I'd say it was worth it.  The game is simple is to describe and analyze. It's a cartoon-animated, detective style point &amp; click adventure with a focus on humorous yet dated jokes, puzzles that are way too easy to be worthy of the name and surprisingly good voice acting. There's not combining item+item or item+environment in order to MacGyver your way out of trouble. There's a bit of exploration and dialogue. If you click on all the right places, you'll get a puzzle that will move the story forward. Like I said... Simple. However, despite the aformentioned features, the creator does a good job in creating a narrative that makes you want to see the game through. The characters are well thought out and the story (even thought predictable at some points) is captivating.  If you're looking for a simple yet entertaining couple of hours to pass time on a plane/trip, or if you'd like an inexpensive gift for your young gamer son/nephew, I recommended it.",

Detective Grimoire is also on IOS, where i personally think has a better interface, and touch controls that gives it something more in fun and gameplay.",

The game is very simple, but manages to present a wholefully enjoyable story told by characters with rich personalities and some great humor. It's a game that can and likely will be played in a single session, as the simplistic gameplay never becomes overwhelming and the player always find new interesting story details that will encurage them to press on just a little further.  The story starts as improbable as it gets: Detective Grimoire is send on a murder case that may have been commited by an elusive creature that is the main attaction of a tourist attaction somewhere in the middle of a remote swamp. Strangely enough, Grimoire appears to be the only one confused how such a place can turn any kind of profit and thus begins our strange hunt for clues to unravel this mystery one piece at a time...  You might be best advised to see this game more along the lines of a visual novel, with a few simple puzzles mixed in to keep your brain running. The only flaw the story has in my opinion is that depending on the order you find the clues and how your brain works, you can make a very sure-fire guess who the culpirt is about half the way into the game. Thankfully, the story surrounding the case is much larger than the game first hints at, kepping you invested the full time it takes to find the last missing piece of evidence to cement the case or to figure out the full story surrounding Boggy's Bog.",
