            "review_text": "At first glance, and from it's straightforward name 'Girlfriend Rescue' looks to be a fairly easy or casual sort of game ---- but not too long into the very first world you will find that it is full of intricacies, assorted choices, and complex decisions that reveal a great story that is very difficult to take a break from.  The story told is solid and good fun, the characters are very well developed and likable, and the action/exploration is virtually non-stop.    As the title reveals, your girlfriend has been kidnapped for unknown nefarious reasons in worn down Detroit, and you and your friends immediately set out to rescue her. A big part of the game is the creation of your party from the available characters since each character has different attributes which will change the way you approach the game ---- so the replay value is very high. (especially if you are wanting to unlock all the achievements.)   The artwork is beautifully done, the music adds a lot to the atmosphere of the game, and the gameplay itself is flawless.   There are a great many items to find and spells to use and learn so you need to explore the game very carefully to find everything. Each world (presented in a maze like style) will tell you how many enemies need to be defeated, and once defeated, they do not reappear. Defeat them all for big bonuses.   So there is great fun to be had here with lots of replay that will keep you busy for many hours. Give this one a try, and you will be drawn into a game that is a bit of a variation on the old style rpg experience that is familiar, and very appealing. ",

            "review_text": "   Girlfriend Rescue  is a turn/round-based RPG through and through which starts out with a conversation among friends about approaching your crush, but you find out that some recently escaped prisoner has taken her! You have to form a party to find a way to save her. You start out with choices you can make about your gender, name, crush’s name, and once you can move around, you have a selection of up to two other members you are friendly with that can help you out as you start your quest to get your girl back. I would have liked to have been able to try them all to find out what each possible party member could do, but I would not really know future abilities as they leveled up anyway, so it is probably not a very important issue.   As you begin, you get a lot of nice tips from the local police NPCs on various aspects of play. This was helpful for me as I began journeying around. There are a lot of various original things about this RPG game that I like, such as the various debuffs and what can change when things happen. They are atypical to what I am used to seeing, which is pretty interesting and refreshing to me. I mean, a lot of it involves various stats, so it’s not too different, but the way it is done is not the typical type of stuff. I like what I’ve encountered so far in this game. The combat system is a standard turn-based style where you have attack and defend commands along with special moves you can learn as you level up, which you pick for the next round, and watch the round unfold.  The actual gameplay outside of combat is roaming around a map, trying to find X amount of enemies on the area you explore, and taking out the last guy on the map. I have not tried finishing an area with less than the target number, but I am guessing your bonus reward at the end would change if you got less than the number it shows, which finalizes after the last “boss” character on the map, as far as I can tell, ever since the first area I explored fully.

            "review_text": "A nice game made in the RPG-maker-e with the usual story. Bad guys stole your girlfriend, and you kill enemies, to find out who did it and return it. The plot is supplied through the dialogues in front of each zone at the end thereof, and a few words spoken in a skirmish with the boss levels. The game tells the story of what is happening in our time The pros of the game is quite original for the style of similar games, the possibility of the initial choice of the composition of the team of heroes from a dozen applicants, each of which has its own inclinations, skills and weapons, multiple difficulty levels of the game. Of the minuses - excessive simplicity. The plot consists of eight zones, referred to as the in-game 'worlds'. Generally pretty good quality project producer RPG to RPG-Maker-e Aldorlea Games, perfectly crafted with small drawbacks.",

            "review_text": "I would like to start of by saying that I am usually a big fan of Aldorlea games, especially the Laxius Force and Millennium series, but I honestly did not like this game.  It reminds me more of a dungeon crawler game, as all you really have to do in each world is kill all the enemies and find your way out. There are no sidequests (which is one of the best parts of rpgs in my opinion), and while the fact that you can play as a gay or straight guy or girl is great, the story really didn't grab my attention.",

            "review_text": "I'll start off by saying that for those who don't know, Aldorlea Games produces 16 bit style RPGs in the vein of FF IV-VI, Breath of fire 1&amp;2, etc. They also happen to be a fair bit better at it than most RPGmaker game studios. Although as usual this is produced in RPGmaker, it bears little to no resemblance to their usual offerings.  Pros    Fantastic, varied cast of characters   Excellent graphics quality in cutscenes   Very mechanically deep, probably moreso than any other RPgmaker title   High replayability, especially for an RPGmaker game   Rewards exploration and smart play   Very high 'fun factor'   No grinding   Visible enemies   You can do some really cool S*&amp;% as the game progresses  Cons   Almost utterly nonsensical story   Barely an RPG, more of a mechanical/gameplay challenge with RPG trimmings   Bad choices in initial party selection can make the game very hard, and it can't be changed midgame   Inability to grind (there are only so many enemies in each area) makes the game flow better, prevents power levelling if you have a crappy group   Single playthrough is very short (5ish hours) but the game is geared towards replayability   In game sprites are 'meh' at times, especially enemy art   I have followed and enjoyed Aldorlea/Indinera Falls games since the original Laxius power days, so I'm a tad biased, but I believe this to be a masterpiece of gameplay and mechanics. This reminds me a little of 'Lax Team to the Rescue', which for those who haven't played it, is another game with a large party selection and geared more towards gameplay than story.  I wil note this in bold all caps   FANS OF ALDORLEA GAMES' USUAL WORKS AND RPGMAKER GAMES IN GENREAL MAY NOT LIKE THIS GAME  . If you are looking for a 20+hour game with a storyline that makes any sort of sense look elsewhere, but if you are looking for a great challenge with a wide variety of tactical options, rock solid gameplay and a high replay value, than this is the game for you.",
