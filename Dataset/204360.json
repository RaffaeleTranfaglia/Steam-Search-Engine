            "review_text": "The best part of Castle Crashers is exploring the world - there are tons of levels that look and play completely differently. Though it can be done, single-player assaults are more frustrating and less enjoyable than teaming up with other people. The biggest issue in trying to take on levels solo is that multiple enemies can assault you with ranged attacks, making it difficult to even stand up before being knocked down again. Animal orbs are probably my favorite thing in Castle Crashers because they're just so damn cute.  PRESENTATION:  The story is straightforward and the game is easy to pick up and play.  GRAPHICS:  Everything is beautifully drawn and animated.  SOUND:  The digital, techno tunes are upbeat and perfect background music for raising hell.  GAMEPLAY:  Classic side-scrolling brawler gameplay mixed up with fun boosts and magic makes for a great time with friends. Slightly busted multiplayer is a downer though.  LASTING APPEAL:  The campaign is short, but there are multiple characters to unlock, lots of weapons and animals to unlock and 99 levels to max out, making it a game you can spend some serious time with.   Two other negatives:  The game is not worth the high price. Buy it on sale instead. It can be rather repetetive.  6/10",

What's so cool about Castle Crashers? • Nice cartoon graphics. • Even decent plot. • Lots of funny moments. • Tons of characters to unlock, each one with thier own 'magic'. • Lotsa swords and weapons. • Pet companions. • Interesting sceneries. • With a friend to join your game, the fun is doubled.  There are few disadvantages tho; • 12€ is not so cheap as for indie arcade game.  • Playing alone is not as fun as with friends. • You will need a controller if you want to play on one PC.  Other than that Castle Crashers is one ♥♥♥♥ good arcade game worth your time if you like the genre. I honestly recommend it.  -  D.Punk ",

            "review_text": " Introduction:  Castle Crashers is a 2D hack and slash adventure game set in a cartoonish medieval world of knights, princesses and  dragons  pooping animals. Your only goal is to rescue the four distressed princesses from formidable foes and earn their kisses as a reward. This game is best played with two to three other friends, a controller, and a box of pizza to share.   Pros:  -Over 30 unique characters and dozens of weapons to unlock and choose from. -Cheap DLC characters with proceeds going to charity. -Can be played on keyboard or a controller. -Wonderful cartoonish graphics and easy-to-learn gameplay. -Constant action and a simple levelling system. -Crude humour with poop jokes.   Cons:  -Game can get boring and repetitive after completion with multiple characters. -Lacks a high number of achievements for achievement-loving gamers.   Overall:  Castle Crashers is a fun game to play with friends and is a must-buy when on sale. It is simple and provides constant action throughout the story. Beating the game with certain characters unlocks other unique characters that all have their own pros and cons. With so many weapons, pets and characters to choose from, Castle Clashers is surely an enjoyable classic. My rating would be an 8/10.",

If you don't have anyone to play with at all, you're going to have a...somewhat boring time. The story is good, and can be completed anywhere from 3-13 hours for skilled players. The art style is unique and special, and the story is somewhat short. I definetly expected a lot more in the game and such, but unlocking characters and trying to beat the game with friends will keep you occupied for hours and hours to come. The more players, the better. Single player isn't really anything too good. You should buy it asap if you have other friends who play it, if you don't have any, then I suggest you wait for some friends to get it or buy the 4 pack and give it to friends.",

The game is fun, but since there are only 2 attack buttons it gets redundant fast. Much like with borderlands 2, the story is just too repetitive and they have too many characters to play it as. I guarantee you 1 playthrough of this should be enough to quench your thirst. I'm not saying it's a bad game, the thing about it is just that the only replay value it has is with it's 3000 extra characters, but think about that, would you want to sit at your computer for hours a day as each character trying to get them to level 99? of course not. The game is good though, and it does have some minigames, but expect to lose at them. i give it a 6.5/10.",

Excellent fluid gameplay that stands up to multiple playthroughs. It's filled with humor added with some blood and gore to the mix with its Beat Em Up gameplay style, level up system which adds a bit more depth to the overall gameplay experience as you can increase your stats or learn new attacks. The game also provides a great multiplayer experience with up to 4 players who can engage to the main campaign which comes in two difficulty flavors or duke it out in a arena type PvP style mode. Play as different types of characters with their own magic style, it's pretty a lot of great humor added throughout the game and Nostalgic Beat Em Up Genre and finally.. Decent plotline. Overall! It's a great Indie game Beat Em Up that contains with RPG and Action, i recommend this game for people who are interested with Beat Em Up and Hack and RPG with Action.  Rated: 9.3/10",

I can say for sure that Castle Crashers is one of most interesting beat 'em up games I have ever played. Graphics might look like some kind of game for kind but don't be mistaken - kids, teenagers, adults, everyone will have great time playing this game. With so many characters (few at start, many to unlock) to play, so many levels to make, many weapons and secrets to find, you won't be bored after beating once, or twice, or until you will reach max level with every character. You can enjoy it alone, or with friends on 1 PC or over internet. Castle Crashers isn't not only filled with action, but also with humour, and what's better, the one that will for sure make you laught, unless you take everything too serious. Sure, some people will say it get's boring quickly or it's repetitive but if you ask me, I didn't get bored even once in those 50 (at the moment I'm making this review) hours. And I'm sure I will play it at some point again, and again, and again... and again. It's really easy to get addicted to this game.  In my opinion, it's worth full price but sure, there are people who might not know what Castle Crashers is, or what kind of people made this game. If you are fan of beat 'em up games, then you must grab it at sale. Look at the number of reviews this game have received, and look at what number of those are positives ones - there is high chance that another positive review will be coming from you.",

I watched some gameplay and it immediatly remined me about the game I was playing long time ago. Last summer sale, I've got my hands on this game and started playing. Nostalgia... the gameplay had the same style as Dad n' Me but a bit better. Now, in Castle Crushers you can use diffrent types of swords and magics, diffrent characters, enemies and locations for our fun.

Castle Crashers is a 'beat'em up' style game where you run around beating the snot out of hordes and hordes of baddies by yourself if you dont have any friends or Shouting profanities at each other for stealing the Bounce . With a very Chanllenging game style and a very clever Exp system this game will keep your enthralled for hours upon hours lvling your Multitude of 'knights'  did i fail to mention there are about 15+ diffrent knights to choose from each with their own Magic style .

It's got a hefty amount of clever jokes that aren't too far shoved in your face (like I noticed Ceiling Cat watching me from above in the pet store). But the controls for this game are... to put it gently... relatively poor.  It recommends an Xbox controller, but it's a PC game so it should assume the majority of people will play it using a mouse and keyboard. It translates it's controls as though you're using an Xbox controller first off - something that was a really bad sign to me at first - but the real thing that crimps the controls is the fact you have to hold some buttons and tap others to activate this or that action. Your starting spell for instance is simply 'Hold Shift, press Strong-Attack' while the bolt version of it would be 'Hold Shift, Press Use-Item'. Even then to cast spells in the air you have to use different buttons (Strong-Attack or Use-Item) to decide if you shoot horizontally or downwards which is just feels off (why not just let the movement keys press the direction you want to aim?). The fact that you can't even seperate the Item, magic, and the melee commands makes it bug♥♥♥♥ disorienting.   It's a keyboard: It has enough buttons to cover the actions without having to resort to playing Twister with your fingers.  That said I can't say I've played it and not had a blast yet. Granted I've only been playing it a couple of days so far.  It's by no means an easy game, but it's a fun one.",

Let's start with the good stuff: &gt; The game has an amazing soundtrack (And yes, I do know that the music was made by waterflame) &gt; Great concept, but not very original &gt; Lots of characters with different spells to suit your play style &gt; The game has two DLC's: Pink Knight and The BlackSmith heroes  Now lets go onto the bad stuff: &gt; The game seems very grindy, meaning that if you want to be able to play this game you are going to have to spend your skill points wisely and after a certain amount of levels instead of getting 2 skill points you only get 11, meaning that you have to grind more. &gt; Even though the game has two DLC's, I would not recommend to you that you should buy these because each of the heroes have magic to use against their foes. However the Pink Knight's and the BlackSmith's magic are just re skins of the original magic attacks. With the Pink Knight shooting rainbow's and stuffes animals and the BlackSmith have the armoury frog and a Hammer to throw. &gt; The DLC's do come with weapon's suck as the lollipop for the Pink Knight and the hammer with antlers for the Black Smith, but honestly, these weapons aren't even top tier weapons, I guess the lollipop is good with it's huge agility bonus, but agility isn't one of those skills that you woud want to devote your skill points into when you could actually be putting skill points into magic by using another weapon so that you can explore the DLC's spells. &gt; Final point for the DLC heroes weapon's is that if you have completed the game before, it's just going to be the same story meaning that you are probably going to have quite a few pets and very high tier weapons, so even though you have your DLC weapon, there are still weapons that are going to be much better. &gt; When this game says that they recommend a controller THEY MEAN IT! Personally I found the keyboard controlls extremely uncomfortable so I changed them to the Dota 2 ability shortcuts.  But so yeah, that's a review that I hope will enlighten some of you who actually bother to read this review when there's probably a much better review out there...",

A caution to solo play, it is quite often that you will get 'stunlocked'. You can do this to enemies, and it's funny in multiplayer to just bounce an enemy back and forth between two players. Sadly, it works the other way. A good example is already before the second big boss, which is a giant catfish. This weird hairy creature keeps spawning minions, and a LOT of them. Multiplayer works best because one player can focus on the boss and the others can deal with the minions. In singleplayer, if the minions are let to spawn constantly, the player is swarmed. Not saying that it's the game's fault that you let the enemies spawn in, but without sheer luck and button mashing, the enemies will stunlock you to oblivion and kill you instantly, which is stupid.  I do not recommend playing this game on your own if you do not know what you are doing.",

So the game starts off with the hero of the story, AKA The blue, red, orange or green knight, is dancing in the tavern in the kings castle, no king in particular just the king, but suddenly the door bursts open with a fellow grey knight falling down the stairs, the hero now proceeds up the stairs to find that the kings gem is being stolen by an evil wizard, again not an evil wizard in particular, just an evil wizard, the hero[s] proceed to chase after the evil wizard, while on the way to the wizard you are tasked with fighting barbarians, hooded figures and a minotaur ram that shoots CANONBALLS, AMAZING. Anyway before you can get to the wizard you encounter a GIANT barbarian called The Barbarian King, once defeated you have saved one of the 4 princesses, then you think to yourself, damn, this is gonna take a while Thus begins the epic 20 hour+ adventure around the small, but rich world of castle crashers!!! This is honestly one of my favourite indie/games of all time, but the things that i have wrong with it are the fact that this game has a HORENDUS pc port from xbox, binding the light attack button [x] to the actual button x and heavy atttack to y, except for that, it is amazing to get this game and i really recommend it to EVERYBODY because this game is amazing. 10/10 I ALWAYS DO 10S I KNOW ",

            "review_text": "Castle Crashers was the game back then! It came out long ago, so I'll defend it, by mentioning the fact that the tools used now to create video games, compared to 'long ago', are just plain better.  That aside, that doesn't make CC any worse. CC is a great game. It had a great combat system, unique character magic, characters and weapons. The weapons are mainly cosmetics that change your stats. Aside from these facts, certain character magic abilities, such as the arrow storm, are used across a few of them. The boss fights are great to.  Insane mode exists to. I use the keyboard controls, they aren't bad, it's just people don't want to get used to it. Sure, I can 'Tornado juggle', 'Sand juggle', combine it, if thats the only way people will believe me, 'spellweave', etc. But let's be honest here. By joining random games, people never get the 'hint' to start a lvl 1 character, or play a character near your level. You won't progress if you don't play the exact mission your on, and theres no indicator for that in online play. You could, however, fight over what stage to pick.   That aside, a fair rating for this game, considering its release date and the like,   10/10.  There are 'NEW' games out there, in reality, most are just built on the same system of the previous. Those new games are what I call complete crap. They're all the same. At least, only a few aren't. And don't forget the RNG these days.",

One is not likely to find much to bemoan during the first several playthroughs save for frequent short yet unskippable cutscenes which hamper the replay value. The Insane mode reeks of artifical difficulty and takes insanely LONGER than the regular game, and this port is missing the Volleyball mini-game from the PS3 version, as well as having no enhancements over any version, so when you see STEAM EDITION on the title screen, just... don't mind that.   Oh but the game offers many hours of gameplay and great combat mechanics. The levelling system is something I'd rather do without but I do like the abundant weaponry to collect.   This is especially a great multiplayer game, it's easy to pick up and pretty forgiving initially, and it's really cute.  My biggest complaint is that the 'hovercraft level' is ridiculously easy.

When I saw that it was on Steam, I of course had to plunk down another $15, and it was even more so worth it, since it visually looks better.  Castle Crashers is a sidescrolling hack 'n' slash beat 'em up. The game itself isn't TOO long, but with 4 players, and a 'Hard' mode (which is as close as you'll get to a New Game +), with several playable characters (that really aren't that different from one another, besides magic and appearence), and the ability to play this game with 3 other people (4 total, the way it was meant to be), there's quite a ton of replayability. Plus, the OST's fantastic, really some of Newgrounds' best.  If you're skeptical, maybe not worth $15, but if it's on sale, worth it all day.  6.5/10",

I would say the game is most fun in co-op, but whether you play co-op or single player the game will get boring after the 4th or 5th level as nothing is added to the gameplay. You have a normal attack, a heavy attack and a magic attack. Your magic attack is dependent on the character you selected at the start of the game and a lot of the time its not worth using at all. You can also block, jump and shoot arrows and... that's it, the level designs and boss fights can be interesting at times but most of the time you'll just be jumping and spamming attack regardless so it isn't enough to keep it interesting.

And so, without filters or automatic filters, you, a lvl 1 player will be put in a team with 3 lvl 40 players. At the end of each map, there will be a pvp battle between the team members to win a princess. And as I said, as a lvl 1 player, you have no god damn chance agains 3 other lvl 40 players. You can hit them for 15 minutes and they won't die. But they will hit you once and you're out of the fight. The game is buggy. Me and my friend were once playing together and at some point, the game messed up and we were put into 2 different maps with a Bot replacing the other one in each one's game. When you're choosing your map, there is no admin, king player, top player or voting. Everyone can choose which map to go to. Which means 4 players will spam their buttons to get to the map they want. Which never ends well.  I give it 2/10 and do not recommend it at all.",

I know they say these games should be played on a controller but that's just rubbish. I've never ever seen a game that wouldn't be totally playable on keyboard, until now perhaps, and that's just because of the laziness of developers. They didn't even bother replacing the controller button hints with keyboard ones!  Besides that, I can see the developers have put some effort on making this game not totally repetive random button smashing endless mass murder -simulator. They only got halfway there, as it is still basically repetive random button smashing endless mass murder -simulator, despite the fact that the mechanics do try to alternate from time to time. Also, the way they tried to implement depth in a 2D game makes landing your hits hard and the fact that in a 4-player co-op the screen gets full of stuff doesn't help either.  Lastly, the story is just another bad unimaginative 'save the helpless princess' -cliche combined with even worse and cheaper humour which is mostly pee-fart-poo-department.  On the other hand, maybe fighting games just aren't my cup of tea...",

            "review_text": "Beat Em Ups have a special place in my enlarged, Adderall-damaged heart. I used to play games like Double Dragon and River City Ransom to drown out the irritating sound of my ex-wife's damaged vocal chords as she attempted to crawl out of the meat freezer without her legs to call for help. But out of one of the darkest, dampest and most used tissue-ridden corners of the early 00's internet came a game that ♥♥♥♥ all over my retirement years: Castle Crashers. A Co-Op game slapped together in a weekend at the local  Gay Pride  Indie Game Development resort by a group of limp-wristed dweebs from  Newgrounds.com  in a desperate attempt to elevate the site as something more than a Sonic The Hedgehog H-Game breeding ground (They don't call him 'Knuckles' for nothing!)   Amazingly the developers somehow got away with releasing a flash game for an exorbitant amount of money. This game alone is $15 full price for a grand total of 5 hours of gameplay if you're not a stupid enough son of a ♥♥♥♥♥ to try and unlock all of the characters ( pro-tip: they're all reskins of each other ) and thats not counting the DLC to nickel and dime you with.   The game is a poorly-optimized PC port the likes of which would make even Arkham Knight blush. First thing it does is try to extort you into letting the dev's secret lover, Microsoft, shoot their poz-load into your wallet's neg-hole for a Controller, to the point where they couldn't be ♥♥♥♥♥ to draw symbols for actual Keyboard keys. Most of the fun of the game comes as you stumble about trying to figure out what the 360 buttons translate to with the convoluted Keyboard controls. If I wanted to use a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ controller I would've killed myself by now. But I guess when you're too busy pleasuring yourself with a realdoll of Super Meat Boy, its just too hard to adapt the UI for a different platform.   The gameplay is standard fare for a co-op Beat Em Up except you can level up your attack, defense, speed or special magic abillities. As well as there being a variety of weapons, most of which are ♥♥♥♥ing useless to create the illusion of content. After the third chapter of the game, the level designer and programmers must have gotten really sleepy from the half-♥♥♥♥♥ creation of the netcode for multiplayer and fell asleep at their computers, because soon you'll be saddled with hordes of the same enemies you have to hack at for hours to kill and lazy boss design that boils down to everyone being the same damage sponge. Not only this, you wind up with some gimmicky levels to break up the non-existent pacing. The one thing I think we can all agree on is that all Beat Em Ups need a self-destruct sequence where you have to avoid hitstun obstacles under an extremely short time limit to complete the level; one ♥♥♥♥ up and you're done.   But where I personally believe this game shines is the HILARIOUS and QUIRKY humor that only Newgrounds users could deliver. For instance, in the second level you're being followed by a giant Troll monster that shakes the earth with every step. What better way to show off the comedic chops of the developers than to make every animal you encounter ♥♥♥♥ themselves profusely at the sight of the monster, to the point where they propel across the environment. And to make sure you've noticed this shining example of Video Game humor, they do this four different times throughout the level; a textbook example and fair warning of what to expect from the rest of the game.  After another 19 levels of slow, monotonous trash you finally reach your final destination: the lair of the Dark Wizard himself (rumors say that Tom Fulp likes to call himself this as he's animating his fantasies of finally beating up his dad set to Linkin Park on the Newgrounds flash portal). But before you can finally be free from this mortal coil, why don't you do some more completely 'UNIQUE and VARIED'   [Citation Needed]   boss battles? By this point I was already in cardiac arrest because this was so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ boring, but the hospital staff was kind enough to replace my heart monitor screen with the game so I could finally finish it- this time pumped up full of morphine to dull the suicidal thoughts. It was no surprise that the developers simply gave up because the final boss is one of the generic mooks you were beating on at the start of the level. After another lame boss fight and credit roll you get to the true ending. Think you're going to get the princess, live happily ever after, and apply for a refund on Steam? Nope. You're just treated to a prime example of why middle aged men should never try to be 'hip with the cool kids' on the internet. The cringe-inducing 'wackiness' and 'quirkiness' of the ending put me into a 6-month coma from which the doctors never expected me to recover, and I still can't feel the left side of my face.   4/10 : Let's just say they never made a Castle Crashers 2 for a reason.",

You won't be disappointed.",

            "review_text": "Even though it's not my kind of game... usually, I don't find this to be a bad game. Castle Crashers is a game that fits snug in the casual/party genre. I can confidently say that I don't like party games, I really don't. I could go on a long tirade on why I dislike party games but this isn't the place for that.   Really, it isn't a bad game at all. Anyone who launches this game off of Steam can see this is the product of the hard work and creativity of very skilled developers. This is a game that accomplishes exactly what it sets out to be. Castle Crashers doesn't have the gameplay depth of chess or the storytelling depth of Animal Farm because it would go against the very foundation it stands for.  Castle Crashers can be summed up simply by two words: DUMB FUN.  And despite my distaste for the genre itself I do find myself drawn to the game from time to time. Sometimes I just want to mash the buttons on my fightstick instead of performing intricate combos or dodging bullets. Really it's best played in periods of 20 minutes at a time or in social situations. There isn't enough gameplay depth to play for hours on end. Mashing three buttons gets reptitive after a while. And that's perfectly allright because obviously plenty of casual gamers have been enjoying gaming in short bursts, sneaking in a game or two before going back to work.",

This make for some interesting dynamic when playing with friends as you can each get your own strengts and weaknesses.

But, on my Xbox I played for a lot longer and have had a lot more experience with this game. And I have to tell you, I absolutely love this game and everything it brings to the world it has created. This game at its core is a side-scrolling hack and slash adventure with distinctive graphics and an amazing soundtrack. Its gameplay was well created, keeping the game fresh feeling throughout, It has a simple leveling system that actually changes your experience with the different strategies you use to level skills, and the level design is entertaining and makes you feel like actual progression is made, rather than feeling like you have been in the same area for the entire game. I also read what others said about this game to get a feel for how many other casual gamers see the game. Many feel that the lack of voice recording or story makes this game just short of perfect. I could understand how this could be a legitimate concern for many but, I can try to explain why it is not such a bad thing. This is a definate party game that you would sit down with 3 other friends with and play. Many games that are developed like this do not have open and rich lore that can be explored and cherished. This game being one of them, instead gave the game a 'Save the Princess!' type of story that does well with the kind of game this is. Voice acting though usually goes hand in hand with story progression. This game could have used some sort of voice acting to give the game depth and more relatable characters, but whoes gonna relate to blood thirsty knights who have killed hundreds of enemies and friends for a simple kiss from a princess? That's why I feel the games story is unimportant, because the game made itself to rather be a more fun and entertaining multiplayer game, rather than a long and eventful epic that indulges the player in its characters and story. Of course all of this is opinionated to specific people so I'll let you decide if you want to buy the game or not.  10/10",

Pros; -Good, fast paced fun -Different variations in enemies -Funny Power-ups.  Cons; -If one player in the group has less than preferred internet connection, it slows down the game for everyone, getting them trapped in a loop of 'waiting for players'. This can also happen if one player is playing at a resolution that is either not the same as everyone else or too high for their machine. -Somewhat confusing parts that require googling.

It also had minigames such as all you can quaff and the arena which will get your competitive side showing against your friends. There are a huge variety of characters as you progress but the starting collection is limited, which is one downside. I also got annoyed that the game isnt made for keyboard controls and the keyboard controls it already has are just plain terrible, so you'll have to cutomize it (and memorize it because it show Xbox controls n the screen).

Some are based on classic games like arrows, enter, and when you try WASD you figure out that A shoots arrows and D hits stuff, but then when combos start to pop up saying 'B+X' it shows its religious tendencies and put your guesses in the good hands of God.

For a game that came out a few years back. This would count as a steam classic for me. The story is simple. Your a knight. The princesses have been kidnapped. Save them. It's simple, but it does a really good job in making the story part of the game. Every time you beat a certain boss, you get one of the 4 princesses. It's more of a reward since you can basically go all in by just kissing the princess after beating the boss. I like the gameplay and the story.  Multiplayer? It's alright. There are two options when you go into multiplayer; All you can eat, and Story mode (Co-Op Online.) Now multi player online isnt really good since most people just play single player. So your better off just having a friend on steam play with you.  That kind of covers it. There are Characters. They are mostly the same thing but they have different specials. They have weapons that you find throughout the game, but it really dosnt do much since the game gets harder as it goes on so in the end it dosnt really change much.  So lets see the ups. (Story/Gameplay/Multiplayer1/2.) Thats a solid 9.5 Now the downs.(Multiplayer1/2.) Thats mostly it... Thats minus 0.5  End Rating: 9  Letter rating: A+  This game is a pure classic. It does alot of things right for a game that came out 7 years ago.(If your reading this in 2016, 8 years.) This game is highly recommended from me and, I hope you have fun playing this game if you end up buying it. And I hope you dont regret it! Cheers!  ~Mabel",

You have a sullen purple knight with antlers banging out swords on the anvil. Then you have a frog with antlers with its mouth open. You walk in the mouth and you see every single weapon for sale inside of the frog. It's interesting to say the least. Also, if you own Battleblock Theater, you can play as Hatty.

Castle Crashers was a classic on the Xbox 360 Arcade, and it's great to see it come to PC. That said, there are a few problems.  The most notable is just how terrible keyboard/mouse gameplay is. I can't stress enough that without a gamepad Castle Crashers just isn't worth playing. Getting into your friend's games can also be a bit of a chore, but once you are in the lag is what can really kill you. Being in the US and playing with an Australian proved to be quite the challenge in lag compensation for whomever wasn't the host. That is a pretty extreme gap in distance in all fairness, but still worth bringing up.  Four Friends, Four Gamepads, Four Copies of Castle Crashers.

The character progression is simple but effective all the same, and the character selection is chalk full of lots of different choices that make surprisingly big differences. Even without the DLC classes, there are lots of choices (once you beat the game to unlock them). My friends and I are big proponents for the couch co-op genre, though it seems to be a dying breed these days. Castle Crashers is a staple of the casual couch co-op that I grew up loving. Some people complain that the $15 price tag is too much for a sidescroller with repetitve gameplay, but they couldn't be mroe wrong. In the short time that I've actually played it, I already feel like I've gotten more than my money's worth.

But possibly lacking the replay-ability of other games, as all once completed with a certain character you can unlock another, then complete it with them. I'd recommend it but only if you have a friend to play it with! Fantastic game, not one you'd sink many hours into but it is very fun to play with friends. Great to come back to every few weeks and progress a bit more. Lots of unlockables, difficult to 100%. Fun to play.   Recommend It. (Have a friend get it aswell as it increases replay-ability)",

Art is fantastic, funny, and deserves your attention.  Only negative comment I have is that it seems that there are few people playing, sometimes it's hard to even find one match.

This is a game that you can play solo however it's much more fun with friends. Much like Borderlands 1 and 2. There is a lot of characters to unlock and even a hardcore mode when you beat the game. However, although this game is fun, it does not have a lot of replayability. It had some with the many different animals and weapons you can find and all the different characters you can unlock by beating the game or arenas sprinkled through the game.   One this I can say is it's worth the money for a simple beat 'em up game with a level up system. I highly recomend it for any player who enjoys really fun and smooth gameplay, amazing music and just all around fun to plaay around.",

You would think that killing basically the same enemy over and over would get boring, but it doesn't. Ever. The character progression is simple but effective all the same, and the character selection is chalk full of lots of different choices that make surprisingly big differences. Even without the DLC classes, there are lots of choices (once you beat the game to unlock them). My friends and I are big proponents for the couch co-op genre, though it seems to be a dying breed these days. Castle Crashers is a staple of the casual couch co-op that I grew up loving. Some people complain that the $15 price tag is too much for a sidescroller with repetitve gameplay, but they couldn't be mroe wrong. In the short time that I've actually played it, I already feel like I've gotten more than my money's worth.  It's easy to pick up, can occupy you for five minutes or five hours, and will have you chuckling to yourself the whole time. What more do you want?

Once you complete the game you can go back to play any of the other levels again and still keep your characters level and weapons or you can attempt the insane mode if you want a harder challenge. One negative with the game is the fact that it can get quite repetitive playing on your own but if you were playing the game with friends it probably wouldn’t feel as repetitive at times.

            "review_text": "Ok....  So I felt I needed to give this game a decent shot before coming on Stream to review. Please also bear in mind when I purchased this game it was under £5.00 if my memory serves me correctly....  .....and I freakin love it!  For older gamers like me (35+) I would described Castle Crashers as a greatly improved version of Golden Axe. Obviously the old arcade classic was limited given it's release year was 1989, but it was still a whole lotta fun. You were pushing buttons frantically in a side-scrolling, beat 'em up, hack and slash fashion in order to save a damsel in distress.   Castle Crashers adopts this platform beautifully, and then some. The game allows you to build your character up as you earn XP from killing bad guys. The four areas of development are Strength, Magic, Defense and Agility. You can tailor the skills tree to your game style, and you can loot weaponry along the way to suit your style. If you would rather be a quick, nimble spell caster rather than a slugging but powerful tank then so be it. It's all a bit of fun anyway. Along the way you also collect coins from killing enemies, as well as stumbling across bags of gold, various jewels and mega rewards for slaying end bosses. There are sections along the way where you can spend your money on various items such as healing potions, weapons etc.  Another really cool element are the pets you befriend along the way. Depending upon the pet, it will aid you for the purpose it serves. For example the little bat you befriend gnaws the heads off your enemies along side you. The little seahorse allows you to travel through water more quickly. You can change your little buddies as and when you wish so long as there is another pet waiting to be loved.  You get to pick from a number of characters when you start your Castle Crashers quest, each character having a different type of magic to them. So far I have seen Ghostly Green Dust Cloud from the Green Dude, and a Thunderbolt from the Red dude. I haven't played long enough to check out the other characters.  In summary the game is a lot of fun. You can play solo or link up with friends via the multiplayer option. If you would rather just kick the crap out of people in an arena setting then you can do that! The main thing I have enjoyed thus far is the game's simplicity. They advise a joypad to play but I've had no problems with my keyboard. The game could have been a whole lot more finicky, with an overload of combos and moves, but what would be the point in having to learn all those stupid moved when all you really want to do is swing a spiked mace at someone.  I'm sure I have left out lots, but another outstanding feature in the game is it's humor. I'm not in the business of spoiling so you can find out for yourself, but there are definite moment where you can clearly see the designers were having a good old laugh.  Oh, and soundtrack is surprisingly good from fast Drum n Bass to trace like music you'd hear from Arabian Nights.  I will give it 7 out of 10. Great value and lots of fun.",

I think that this game needs an update where it only teaches controller support if you have a controller plugged into your computer.  This game has an amazing story about princesses getting captured. The game starts out with a short silent cutscene with princesses getting captured by bandits. You start in a tavern on your quest to rescue them.  Now don’t get me wrong, I love this game with its easy to follow storyline and amazing graphics but it does have flaws. The $1 DLCs only give you one character but the magic abilities that come with each character, starter ones and DLC ones.  Overall this is an amazing game with its flaws, but every game has them. Just consider these before purchasing a game with a flaw that you can’t handle. And even if you are considering this for a normal computer, don’t worry! I don’t own a gaming PC and run a super slow desktop and this runs at about 60 FPS. It has little to no lag! ",

The wepons, the magic, the bosses, ect.  But the thing that really threw me off was the fact that the controls w/ the keyboard was a little screwy, and would probably be better with a controler. The controls were just all over the place for me and it took me a while to change a lot of things to get it to tickle my fancy.

I would definately recommend this to gamers who love working hard for items and characters.",

They upped the framerate cap to 60, increased texture resolution, added in keyboard button prompts that change automatically if you switch input methods, and possibly even increased screen resolution options, I'm not sure it supported 2560x1440 before, but it does now. It's awesome to see the game running this smooth and it's definitely worth a replay.  As far as gameplay, there's not much new from the previous version. There's a new (frustrating) game mode and 'All You Can Quaff' is gone. I'm pretty sure deleting that mini-game should be considered a feature. It was terrible.

Castle crashers is a very fun game in which the point is to save the princesses from being kidnapped, it is very long and fun but that is what makes it interesting, I mean to beat the whole game, on every character, I would say 1000 hours and above, yeah, you heard me right, to unlock all the characters you need to beat the game on there 1st stage, 2nd stage, then 3rd stage, then beat them on insane mode, plus the 2 dlc characters that are 1.29 each! lDid I say 1000 hours? Make it your WHOLE LIFE! Once you beat the game on every character (INCLUDING INSANE MODE) you can reset your character's stats, however, if you don't, you can play arena mode and many more modes with all your levels! Or you can connect to a friend, beat the boss for him and get him a cool sword, you can also replay levels! Overall I am saying the value you are getting here is INCREDIBLE, SO MUCH PLAY TIME!!!

I can't stop myself from playing this game, its meant to be played more than once. The story is short, FUNNY and very simple, it takes between 5 and 9 hours to finishs so if you get addicted you can go trough the game a dozen times just to unlock everything. at this point, i have played for 24 hours and have unlocked less than half the characters and still need to find some of the weapons. The fact that this game is made for coop, makes it even more fun, when you play with your friends (or even strangers), it makes this 2008 game just like a new one, its a lot more fun.  for those who like it hard it even brings an 'insane' mode to the table.  if there is any downside, it's that it gets repetitive the second time around.  pros  -great replay value -great coop -simple, funny and enjoyable story -fluid combat -lovely graphics -you can play this game years later and its still fresh.  cons  -repetitive (the second time and after only) -no depth to the story and world (but who cares, it's fun anyway)     920/1000",

You level up into different attributes, learn new magic moves and try out new weapons.   One of the downsides we found was it can be hard to tell if you're standing in the right spot to hit an enemy. It can be hard to adjust perfectly but this didn't really make us want to quit or even change our opinion of the game.",

It is based in a silly medieval fantasy world where your goal is to save princesses from an evil magician. All that was done way before Aventure Time became popular.  It has an original style, with the vibe of older games made by the same developers, and a good sense of humour.  The fighting system is quite complex for a game of this genre and presents the players with a good variety of combos which increase in numbers with level progression. Friends of mine who were not used to games of this type usualy feel overwhelmed after a few levels.  The level progression adds an element that enhances the experience as an element of competion between the players. It allows players to upgrade different stats which unlock combos and abilities which gives options 'builds' for different playthroughs, although magic and melee weapon attack are always the best options to choose from. It is also fun to have different players focusing on a certain stat more than the others.  There is a choice of characters to play with which except for the visual style differ only in the types of spells they cast which can be very different from each other in terms of damage, area of effect and the effect itself. I found this more than enough to make want to play the game again as other characters.  A variety of weapons and consumables are also present, but they do not change the gameplay to a great extent. The absence of different bows other than the starting one is also disappointing,  There are a lot of different enemy types, some of which can be unlocked as player-controled characters which adds to the game's replayability.  The levels are numerous and with a different feel to most of them. One of the most pleasant surprises was how long the game was.  Definetely the best co-op side-scroller I have played and I have played a decent number of them.",

All of the in game key prompts are for the 360 pad which means that if you don't have one you'll be out of luck, While the game is still playable with keyboard, it is an exercise in frustration as none of the ingame prompts are correct, and you can only find out the actual key configuration by looking in the menu and switching back and forth between the keyboard controls config and controller config. Every combo has to be practically translated in order to be used. The game claims to simply recommend the controller, but in reality punishes you if you don't use one. However, if you do have a 360 pad then you can just ignore everything I just said.  As for the game itself, it is remarkable. It is a simple yet quite enjoyable beat em up with a simple sense of humor that can delight (even if it is crude). The game was built with co-op in mind, and allows for both local and online play. There is a wealth of characters, weapons, and animal orbs (special followers that provide useful abilities or passive buffs) to unlock. the single player is fine on its own, and the game can be quite challenging without friends, but is far from unfair. If you do plan on playing with friends, it is recommended that the character you use be used solely for multiplayer with those friends, as the game is far more enjoyable when everyone is close in level. Of course, you start off with four different characters right off the bat, and unlock a number of others fairly quickly so there is plenty of room for experimentation before committing to a character.  All in all, if you have a 360 pad and so do your friends, then this is a great game to get, even at full price.",

Let's do a pros and cons thing, just because. Pros: POOP JOKES Lots of characters Lots of weapons Lots of pets Lots of bosses Awesome magic abilities Making out with pricesses (after you slaughter your friends of course) Cons: Short game, getting all of the characters is a long (and boring) process but it does help lengthen the game Hard to find people on multiplayer (for me at least) POOP JOKES (I really want to emphasize The Behemoth's immaturaty) Overall, I would reccomend this game, just make sure to bring along your friends.",

There are plenty of jokes and funny experiences for every sense of humor. The game is also provides some fantastic and diverse challenges. There are interesting characters around every corner and just when you think things can't get any more silly, they do. Overall a great game, although I can't recommend playing through it by yourself it is for sure great fun with friends!",
