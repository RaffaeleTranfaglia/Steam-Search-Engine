You might not become addicted to it but it's a very entertaining game and the puzzels get you thinking a bit at times.  Also did I mention the game has faces on the rocks and clouds? I think that's enough reason already to play the game.",

The music is inkeeping with the style and not too annoying. If I had one bone to pick it would be the placement of the restart button (sometimes you'll hit it accidentally right when you're about to win a really difficult level). But definitely recommend!",

Being able to mod the game adds more longevity and the chance to unleash your creative side. Can you design the ultimate level to frustrate your friends?  I recommend you purchase this as it's the Civilization equivalent of the puzzle platformer genre, just ONE more go!",
