It has a great sense of speed, great art direction, and a cute little story. There are also a few extra stages for time trials, which are fun. The time trial mode is enjoyable too, and focuses more heavily on the aspects where the game shines the brightest; it's speed. After beating the game once, I still feel there is a lot I missed, which offers some replayability.",
