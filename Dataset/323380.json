I wanted to play this, i wanted to see what i could do. Then i found out there isn't much at all. This whole game could have been so much more. But you basically did what the game itself did.

            "review_text": "If you enjoy games such as Antichamber, Stanley Parable, and/or Bioshock I think you’ll like this. It emphasizes exploration more than puzzles or combat, but I think it’s somewhere in that range. Very refreshing and very worth your time.  I’d been excited to play this because of Jordan Thomas’s involvement (Shalebridge Cradle, Fort Frolic), but otherwise didn’t know what to expect.  The first surprise is that it’s the funniest game he’s worked on. The narrative is mostly delivered by overhearing conversations, sort of a comedy radio play. The characters are exaggerated blends of some well-known developers (Richard “Lord British” Garriott, John Romero, Warren Spector, Stevie Case, etc.). Some characters talk directly to you, but since you are involved in the fiction as a ‘player’ it frequently makes jokes as it breaks the 4th wall. The world contains a huge number visual gags about unfinished/buggy/cliché games and these are funny as long as you’ve looked at a level editor or bad game even once. There’s also text logs that poke fun at the petty disagreements that happen when developing a game.  The second surprise (though more in tune with Jordan’s other work) is that it’s really creepy. Everything in the game’s presentation is trying to unsettle you. The world looks like it’s barely held together and every action you take looks breaks the world just a little more, almost to the point of snapping in two. There’s layers of subtext anywhere you look and it’s like snooping in someone’s trash. The motivations and origins of characters are mysterious enough to draw you in and push your comfort level as you voyeuristically hear their interactions.  The third surprise is the actual gameplay. It’s hard to tell if this is a FPS, RPG, or what from the trailer (or even the first hour of play). It finally hit me that the easiest description is that it’s a necromancer game with some light puzzle elements. It’s presented as an open world, but some directions are blocked off until you find a decent combination of ‘spells’ to open up a new path. The necromancy also plays into the creepiness since your army of the undead is kind of a loud menace that won’t give you personal space.  The final section of the game goes in some crazy directions with story and gameplay. It’s a little too much to take in as one big chunk, but it’s also a great climax that makes the game feel complete. It’s a nice self-contained story and I can’t fault for being a bit meta or navel gazing when it’s so unlike anything else I’ve played before.",

Cons:  - Very brief experience - Not enough puzzles centered around the hacking gameplay for my liking since it basically feels like you're just knicking abilities in order - Despite seeming non-linear, its very linear with a somewhat specific order to get abilities - Postgame REALLY falls apart - Some more color and striking visuals would have been nice.

While the game is interresting it kind of keeps dropping ideas. It tries to put a lot of game mechanics into the game and changes when you use these mechanics in a kind of an episodic way.   The idea of hacking entities during the game is a very interresting mechanic (although done before in 'hack and slash'). However it is quite shallow; There is a very small range of 'parts'   The idea of sapotaging the E3 (named E4) conferration is fun as well. However it's a small part of the game.   Making your own game and letting people play through it is, well honestly it's not great as the 'player' AI isn't great, nor the pathfinding for that matter.   The humor is a small part of the game, most of it coming from the voice recordings you find in the world. However some of the dialogue at the end is, weird at best - cringe worthy at best.   The satire is there, but it fades in comparison to some of the mechanics. Like if you think about it you see it. But while it is indeed satire, it's not very apparent.   So is it a good game, it's a series of good ideas. Is it worth your money? Not really as it honestly is too pricey at 19 euros.",

You just happen to be the one that's come along to get things moving.  The enjoyment you get from this game will correlate heavily with how you choose to explore the the world and the creatures in it. You could do a barebones run and complete the game with minimal effort, or you could explore and see what's around the next corner. You could get around with few interactions or form your own monstrous squad to follow you around and keep you company :)   There are a few moments in the game where you may get lost in confusion. You can't really get lost because you have a teleport function on your map, but the game needs a little bit of backtracking at time. It may not be obvious when you have gained the knowledge to progress further in.    Wonderful game. Try to let go of some of your gaming habits if you're a hard core gamer. The best part is: it has a demo :D :D:D try it out!!!",

            "review_text": "The Magic Circle is an immaculate game where you delve into the depths of an unfinished game. You, the player are tasked with testing a game that has been stuck in development hell, however the game is nowhere near finished regardless of the multitude of years spent in development. Along your way you stumble across a being who has been stuck within the game since its inception, trapped and alone, the developers indifferent to his existence. You are given the power to shape and mold the creatures as you see fit, outfitting them with different features from various other entities within the game.   This game is well worth your time, with its fantastic story direction, and overall freedom to accomplish tasks as you please. If you've 'seen it all' from the game industry, this game is for you.  Pros:   - Freedom of progression, as well as freedom to accomplish tasks in any way you see fit.  - The innate lack of a combat system for yourself, forcing you to rely upon the creatures you encounter along the way to protect you.   - Mold the games creatures any way you like to accomplish any task. Take features from specific creatures, and add them to your personal collection of modifications you can apply to anything at any time. Do you want a turtle that has a teleportation pad on its back? YOU GOT IT.  - Fantastic Story Direction, with a twist at the end I wasn't expecting whatsoever.  - Fantastic soundtrack, which made me feel as though I was actually within the game, controlling everything myself.  - Simple collectibles system.  - Return to the game world after completing the game to allow for completionists to find any missed collectibles.   Cons:   - Short game. For the price point of $20, the game is incredibly short, spanning about 5-7 hours, whilst they are incredibly enjoyable, it is a tad much for the game.  - There is an issue of glitching through the game, as well as glitching into specific objects at certain intervals.  - Clunky movement system, wherein the player hitbox seems larger than the player himself.   Overall: I would recommend this game to anyone I know, due to its completely unconventional nature in that you are the one to shape the game world and bend it to your very will.",

This is a game with a purpose. And it's damn fun to boot.  The basic concept is that you're a beta tester for a hilariously and tragically unfinished game trapped in development hell by its creators, who are all various shades of borderline-insane. Then, a being calling himself 'The Pro' (voiced by Stephen Russell, the guy who played the hero in the original Thief Games) contacts you and tells you he wants you to fix this mess and get the game SHIPPED.  How do you fix it? By literally stealing 'Life' from the nooks and crannies of the world, then using it to essentially hack into enemies to make them do what you need them to do. It's basically a big open-ended sandbox puzzle game. One filled with secrets, hidden abilities, and tons upon tons of audio logs detailing the game's spiral into madness.  Every time I thought I had the game figured out, it threw me another curveball, forcing me to rethink everything about it.  If you can think of a way to solve a problem, it's legit. And BOY are there a lot of possibilities. Army of fanged mushrooms? Easy. Demon-monkey-dogs you lob as if they were GRENADES? Knock yourself out. And that's just the simple stuff you can do. The vast amout of surprises and twists the game throws at you is sheer madness, and I love it. And that finale...I will not be forgetting that amazing conclusion any time soon.  As someone who is studying to hopefully develop games in the future, this game hit home in so many amazing ways, and I had an absolute BLAST with it. Don't look up anything more about the game. You'll just spoil yourself. This is a game that thrives on discovery and surprise. Anything you look up can ruin things for you.  So, if you're curious about game development, or you want to see crazy new story angles, are a fan of emergent gameplay, or just want a snarky and clever open-world puzzle game, you NEED this game in your life.

Replayability is high though, with various contextual comments from different characters, and a few different ways for the final stage to go.  My biggest fear when going into this game was that it would be TOO complex, and that the systems to alter and manipulate the game would be off-putting and difficult to handle. But, while a couple improvements can be made to make things flow a bit more smoothly, the system for altering the game mechanics is actually very simple and fun.

The Magic Circle had a good mix of open world and linear gameplay for such a small game, and though I had to figure out how to 'beat' the game, it was not impossible to do so. I had quite the surprise when I made that last discovery -- won't share it here to preserve freshness -- on something I had been wondering about since roughly half-way through playing. So worth it when I figured it out, and finding the notes to ... someone. I think what really made the game a worthwhile purchase for me was the end-game, and realizing that searching for every nook and cranny while playing really paid off. I must say -- THAT's how you do it. Great job, guys.  Even though I was able to finish the game in an afternoon/evening, this game was worth every penny for me.

I spent a good 4 hours on this game from the moment I finished downloading it and once I was done, I wished that the game had more content in it than it already does. I wished for more areas, creatures, programming bits, and more story. But hey, I shouldnt be wishing for more, I should be praising the game as it is. After all, I do believe its an indie game.
