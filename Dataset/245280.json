            "review_text": "Enslaved: Odyssey to the West is a very good, but somewhat flawed game that deserves to be played by anyone who likes action-adventure-platformers. This game reminded me a lot of the Prince of Persia game from 2008. You do a fair amount of easy platforming and also spent a pretty good amount of time in combat. The combat is by no means difficult and by no means super interesting.  What makes the game work is that it does the few things it does very well. The platforming is solid and has great controls. I found myself enjoying all the little platforming sections they threw at me. They make the next object you are to leap to flash so you never find yourself wondering where to go next. Also, the combat in this game responds well. You are able to upgrade yourself as you play and I found that the extra costumes that came with this version of the game were really useful.   What does not work in this game are the turret sections. I found aiming the turrets in this game to be a chore and that it was really hard to hit moving targets enough to kill them. Obviously, I made it through the game, but I dreaded every time I was in a turret section. Fortunately, there are only about three or four turret sequences. All have terrible checkpoints as well....something that is actually a problem throughout the game. It doesn't save after each major section, but rather saves when it feels like it. I quit once, confident that I would be fine, only to come back and learn I had to replay 10-15 solid minutes. Annoying. The 'surf board' sections are also annoying, but quite brief.  The laziness of the PC port is obvious at times. There are graphical glitches and I once had to reduce the game to the lowest resolution for the character to make a jump. Odd.   A final note about a few high points of the game. The characters and story are really good, as are the graphics. I found myself really liking both the main leads and was very much pulled into their adventure. The voice-acting is top notch and the facial capturing they did for these characters is one of the best in any game I've seen. The environments are lush and beautiful and the game ran smoothly for the most part(aside from a few glitches).  In the end, I loved the game and really recommend it if you liked any Prince of Persia game.  8/10 - a solid game everyone should pick up. ",

            "review_text": "Enslaved is beautiful, interesting, well-acted, and highly polished. Why no recommendation? It's hardly a game at all.  I love the world, and the atmosphere they've created. I like the characters, and wanted to see where their story went. If it weren't for that, I would have quit after the first level. This game is totally on rails.  Your character, appropriately named Monkey, does a LOT of platforming. Most of it is climbing walls and jumping from perch to perch. The problem? You can't miss. You hang from one pre-determined (and helpfully glowing) spot, hold the direction of the next one, and press A. Then you get there, and repeat. There aren't even any choices of where to go; you're simply following a path. Even though you're jumping around like a monkey, it's effectively no different than walking down a hallway in FF13.  You can't even hop down from platforms in non-predetermined places. The game LITERALLY won't let you die from jumping the wrong way. Even in dramatic sections where the wall you're climbing on is crumbling away, you can rest assured that you will make it if you simply hold up and mash A. Seriously. As long as you push the button, you will never lose. If you somehow DO manage to die, it only feels like the game's fault.  And that's the biggest problem: with 90% of the game so streamlined, whenever something isn't immediately obvious the game grinds to a halt. More than once I found myself completely baffled by what to do next, simply because the game had never asked me to figure anything out before.  I beat this game back when it came out on 360, simply because I wanted to see how it ended (Answer? Very strangely.) Now that I'm REplaying it, all I want to do is fight the on-rails system in place here. I find myself constantly grumbling about how Monkey won't do what I'm telling him to, because it's not exactly what the game WANTS me to do.  It's obvious that Ninja Theory really just wanted to tell a story and make some nice cinematics, only adding the gameplay to glue those elements together. You are an actor in their movie, with lines and marks that you must follow, and that comes before actually PLAYING anything resembling a game. If those elements appeal to you, and the game's on sale, you might ultimately enjoy it.  Just don't expect to PLAY it.   P.S. As far as the port goes, it ran well on my PC, but it doesn't support 2560x1440, and if you have both a controller and a joystick, you're gonna have to unplug one before it'll work.",

And it has turned out to be one of my best purchases in a while. I genuinely had fun playing it unlike some other games that i play up until i get all of the card drops. lol. The graphics are solid. The voice-acting is spot on. The characters, they grow on you and make you invested in the game. Pigsy, he has some pretty spot-on one-liners that unexpectedly make you laugh and look like an idiot. haha. From start to finish, this game will entertain without skipping a beat. It's definitely worth if you can get it for less that 10 or 15 dollars.  Happy Gaming,  CARDIO",

            "review_text": "I want to see more games do to the post-apocalyptic genre that ENSLAVED has done here. There's no cold, drab, desaturated colour-palette; instead, everything from the environments to the characters are beautifully vibrant. If there was a single word to describe this game it would have to be 'lush'.  There's not much to the story, there's almost no exposition, but that's okay. I enjoy how the very, very few characters interact with each other. The humour and insults exchanged throughout the dialogue are quirky at first, and there were a few words said that I wasn't expecting to hear from a game such as this, but I found it hilarious and strangely comforting. Maybe because I'd grown attached to what appears to be the only humans left in existence.  There are a number of issues, though. Firstly, the battle camera is horrendous, it makes fighting a lot more difficult than it needs to be as there is no lock-on camera. The field of view is so close to your character it's hard to tell when to block or evade an incoming attack. The battle system is also quite clunky, fighting numbers of enemies at once with melee attacks is sometimes frustrating and tactics such as countering and evading attacks aren't accurate. I found that maximising your ranged weapon's upgrades makes it a lot easier in order to manage groups of enemies from a distance.  The story also seemed to come to an abrupt end. I feel as though an additional one or two chapters would have improved how the last portion of the game unfolded but that's not to say it was a poor ending, it just seemed to be over sooner than I'd have liked. It's a shame too, because the ending raised more questions than had been answered; it was a huge contrast to what I'd previously experienced through my journey and not at all something that I expected to happen.  I also hugely appreciate that the optional collectibles throughout the map actually add to the significance of the story. It's not clear at first what meaning is behind them but it all comes together quite neatly in the end.",

            "review_text": "Like many others I overlooked this game when it was released on consoles several years ago. I simply love anything with a post-apocalyptic theme so it is somewhat odd that it has taken until now for me to get stuck into this. The storyline is based very loosely on the novel 'Journey to the West' written by Wu Cheng'en. But unlike the original story that is set in a fantasy version of ancient China, Enslaved is set 150 years into the future following a global war, with only the remnants of humanity left along with mechs left over from the conflict.  What is refreshing though is that coupled with the damsel in distress angel, the world after the war is actually beautiful to look at. The usual reliance on a grey and brown colour pallete is not here, instead Ninja Theory have taken a different approach and the world hums with light and colour. The ruined city of New York, now decayed and destroyed has been taken back by nature (think of the documentary 'Life After People' and you've got the idea). The games great art style is not restricted to the scenery, as the characters are also pleasing to the eye, especially during the cutscence sequences.  The game is a mostly linear experience that is heavily narrative driven, but this is combined with good action/adventure and platforming mechanics. If you're familiar with console games like Uncharted, you'll be familiar with the formula here. Get from A to B, fight a few monsters, climb on some buildings/structures along your way and deal with the occasional boss.  So go on and buy it! It's worth the asking price. ",

Other pros: - engaging storyline - nice graphics and setting - good music - the 2 characters are well developed and very authentic - the fights are fun and the gameplay is overall satisfying  Cons: - the graphics on the PC need ini tweakage before they look acceptable - gameplay might be a bit repetitive - difficulty might be too easy for some (the plattforming parts are impossible to fail)  Overall I strongly recommend the game.

Because If I did, I might hold my horse back and wait at least for some time!  The game was done by Ninja Theory (which is one of my favourite game studios in U.K), it is pretty amazing on graphics and storyline. (I believe they took some inspirations from a famous Chinese fantasy novel which is called “ Journey to the West” due to some pretty obvious elements from the original novel which I found was hilarious.   The gameplay is a bit different from an AA game we usually play. Your journey is going through with a female NPC who called Trip along your side. But you’re her slave rather than a fair companion, Most of the time, following her orders is the significant part of your objectives, if you don’t do so, she would kill you without a second thought( which I found was not that enjoyable). In addition, this is a very linear game that I need to mention in this review, because some of you might not enjoy it that much.  And also, regarding to the gameplay, it takes some time to get use to her, but before it, you might have a lot of unpleasant experience with her around.  The most terrible part of the game is: The check points are so few, if you die somewhere in a chapter, you would take a big risk to redo the whole chapter again, which I found wasn’t so necessary to an Action &amp; Adventure based-on game. Well, there are few exceptions, but just not that many.  *Warning!! You have to read this below!   Oh, boy...This game could be fantastic if only without SO many bugs and laggy issue which torn the game into pieces.  It has been tested that the game will constantly &amp; randomly freeze and it HAS nothing to do with your machines!   And with countless bugs here and there, it severely damages your gameplay experience and might even stop you from your progress!! I said so, because it happened to many gamers including me. With a long term without frequent check points, this just makes the walkthrough even worse. I had experienced fighting bosses and trigging bugs neither could my character die nor could he attack, and I reloaded the last CP but to find I have to do the whole combat sequence all over again!!   Overall, if you can bare all the bugs which could be breathe taking for the gameplay and laggy issue which is very annoying while engaging your enemies, and still not losing your faith on playing it, this is the game for you!   If you just want to have a trial of it, I strongly recommend you purchase it on the other console like Xbox 360 or PS platform, because the PC console seriously does not look like a finished game, and is way too far waiting to be fixed completely!   Scarlet’s Score: 8.4/10 (However, for all the bugs, Freeze on random Machine, etc.) = 7.4/10",

'Enslaved' has a solid storyline set in an intriguing post-apocalyptic landscape which is boosted by interesting characters who by the way have some of the best facial animations and expressions i've ever seen in a video-game apart from L.A. Noire. The world with it's fantastic looking backrounds makes you feel involved and part of it, and while the gameplay is fairly straightforward and isn't as exciting as done before in games like 'God of War' and 'Prince of Persia' titles in recent years, it is entertainning enough if you don't mind casual games. In the end it's the story and performances that really make this title shine.  Performance wise it's a bit rough on PC (read: rough port), with a few annoying hang-ups here and there, but in all it's a fantastic cinematic adventure. Just be sure to play it with a controller to get the best out of it, while the mouse can come in handy with the shooting parts of the game.",

As far as the good, the story line is amazing, the interaction between the characters, especially Andy Jerkis who plays 'Monkey' is outstanding. There was serious time and consideration put into the plot and the graphics, even though outdated to the razzle-dazzle modern works is still amazing. The puzzles, on regular mode, are not only great, but the tension and stress that specific parts of the game put you through truly build a nice thrill. The game is NOT boring in any of the acts, and the final act is amazing (no spoilers from me you fools!). The battles with mechs and bosses are definitely a challenge and solutions are not just run-head-in and kill. The special skill system is a lot of fun to play with, especially when it is so well-balanced. The collection of orbs make you dangerously greedy, and the flying disc is a hoot and a half to play with as well.

Yes, the graphics are a little dated when compared to visual masterpieces like Wolfenstein: The New Order. Yes, the gameplay is linear. Yes, it's a pretty straight console port where they didn't even bother to change the word 'console' to PC. Yes, the controls are annoying and the camera angles are irritating.  But... this game is FUN. The storyline is interesting enough, but the game really shines through its two main characters--the hulking Monkey and the tech-clever Trip and their journey from a slaver ship to freedom. The way the characters change and their relationship is charmingly set out, and even though other games have done this sort of pairing better (e.g. Last of Us), it's still a great experience.  The combat and action sequences are straight out of a big-budget action flick and the best console platforming. The combat isn't too difficult (if I can get through it, anyone can!) and neither are the platforming puzzles, but there's a joy to this game which is rarely found in gaming these days. It's just plain, outright fun. Even the 'filler' missions never get boring, and it's very well paced.  The graphics  are  dated, but I think they really push the capabilities of Unreal Engine 3 to deliver a satisfying experience. This is a post-apocalytpic world, but unlike the grey-brown ruins that most games delivery, this world is gorgeous. The ruins of the old cities are hauntingly recognisable, but nature is slowly taking them back--this game is simply gorgeous and uses its backdrops and lighting to the best effect. Even the metal monstrosities that litter its landscapes are interesting and intriguing to look at.  And as for the grand finale... one of the most awesome and explosive action-packed climaxes ever. It's slightly predictable, but worth playing through--and the ending is quite well done.  10/10 would rip off a mech's arms backwards and shoot it with its own gun again.",

Not only is The Last of Us built around a burgeoning relationship between two characters who are with each other throughout their journey, like Enslaved, but The Last of Us also boasts a well-realised art style similar to Enslaved's in that it emphasises light, ruin and lush vegetation. Though also like Enslaved, The Last of Us is somewhat let down by the actual nitty-gritty of its gameplay. While Enslaved's platforming is competent, straightforward and fast, its combat very quickly becomes repetitive and frustrating - it really doesn't seem designed to cope with groups, and believe me, there are a lot of group combat scenarios. It's still absolutely worth playing, though, and while its story doesn't push the envelope in quite the same way as the story in The Last of Us, it's still an enjoyable journey with genuinely interesting characters through a stunning gameworld.

I must admit my research was minimal but I found that the homage is mainly the three main characters. Their personalities and visual design. The plot doesn't seem to be emulating the novel, other then being a journey in the western direction. The visuals are where the game shines. The post=appocalitic world it depicts is beautifull even it it's utter devestation. Toppled buildings are sprinkled with lush greenery, invading the ruins of man's fallen empire. Billboards, while whetherd with age, still display their colorful messages brightly. And the animation of running, loping, jumping and swinging is just perfectly executed.  The plot is the standard post appocalyptic sci-fi. Monkey and Trip escape the clutches of a mysterious hostile empire, which uses the technology of the old world to conquer the new. There's a bit more under the surface, but not much. The relationship between Monkey and Trip is relativly interesting. She controls him through a metal headband that compells him to obey her (the same technology used by the antagonists to enslave humanity), echoing the magical thightning crown of the Chinese epic. But slowly they develop genuine friendship and affection. Although there's a bit of a twist there as well.  I liked the game. The gameplay and plot are solid even if they are not particularly inventive and the visual style is trully marvalous.",

For a game I've never heard of prior to its release on Steam, I've enjoyed my time with it more than most major titles I've purchased here.  I'm unsure of how to phrase this without comparing to other well-known series, but as far as gameplay goes, the movement and combat feels a step up from Assassin's Creed(a game which obviously had a bit of influence on this)'s repetetive combat and oftimes cumbersome parkour aspect. Combat here feels fluid and unpredictable, but more importantly, makes you as the player, feel powerful.  As far as characters go, Monkey (that's you) and Trip (the redhead) are one hell of a dynamic duo with a great story pushing them forwards. Once again drawing comparisons to other popular games, Trip is Monkey's Elizabeth (ala Bioshock Infinite), with the added bonus that your life is almost literally tied to hers. Upon their meeting in the prologue, Trip enlists Monkey out of desperation using a headband that wires directly into his brain. Along the way, it has its bonuses such as providing him with a HeadsUp Display and forcing him to obey her commands under threat of death.Slowly, but surely the two bond in their journey to return her to her home. Their dynamic is only buffed by the spectacular voice acting for both characters and flawless animations bringing them to life. Elizabeth was a great companion, but if you want a friend you can really grow to care about in your games, play Enslaved.  Also, the game is ♥♥♥♥ing gorgeous. Beautiful scenery and character design.  I actually had more to write, but I'll play some more before getting to it. Just play the game.",

Sure, if you stop and expect some corners of the game, you'll notice a lack of tesselation, textures being on a flat tile, objects not having as many points as they should, but generally, you'll be too busy climbing or fighting to take the microscope to everything. First off, this is no open world game. Like in many climbing games, there is a high degree of linearity, but you don't feel it as much as in Remember Me or, oh shudder, I am Alive. The climbing is fun, the fighting is, for the most part, also fun, and easy mode is actually easy. The world is beautiful (and colorful), the controls are fluid and sufficiently exact (though I'm not sure I appreciate 'press A+X' type controls, but you only need those if you buy certain fighting skills), and the voice acting is good. The plot is OK -- or rather, you're too busy playing the game to pay too much attention; in fact, the plot and the backstory are a bit meh and confused, and adding quasi-flashbacks in a completely different visual style was a bad decision that breaks immersion when it happens. Your character isn't the most fleshed out ever, but quite serviceable. (Unfortunately, you only get to play Monkey, the man, not Trip, his companion. There is no multi-player either, so Trip is always AI controlled. At least, she has useful skills and isn't the kind of AI that steps in your line of fire, but where she isn't dangerous due to a lack of artificial intelligence, she is as a function of the story -- she is written to get you in trouble, and while her motives are somewhat understandable, she isn't exactly likeable.) In sum, the game feels very arcady -- big sprites, broad strokes, good fun. I bought this at (PC) release, and am not sore for the money. Don't buy if you require open worlds / sandboxes to be happy.

Yes it's that terrible, I have no idea how people tolerate this junk. This will make a normal person ill, and greatly disrupts gameplay. If you can get past that, the only issue thus far seems to be that combat moves simply fail half the time for no reason. You're pretty much limited to your basic attack, because the special attacks don't go off half the time, and when they fail you pretty much fail to do anything and just stand there to get hit.  If you get past those issues, the game is actually really great. While it's true what some say about it being linear, the storytelling is really good, the gameplay (finding your way around) is satisfying, looks and sounds good, and when combat works it works really well.

At one point I was asked to press and hold a button which does not work (middle mouse button); went to change the binding in the options menu so that I could comply and discovered that bindings cannot be changed during gameplay, only from the main menu. This prompted the loss of about fifteen minutes of gameplay which is unfortunate, but fine if it means I can have a good gameplay experience. It happens. While out of the game, I also took the opportunity to try to fix some of the more aggravating gameplay issues such as the inability to change the mouse sensitivity in-game (which is set exceptionally low), the abhorrent camera angles and camera controls and the observation that changing the graphics settings in-game has no effect on the graphics. After an hour of messing around in the initialization files and succeeding only in changing the graphics settings and neither the camera controls or mouse sensitivity, I gave up.  To think that a modern game requires the editing of initialization files to effect changes that appear in the menu system but do not function is really mind-blowing.

            "review_text": "It's Meant For Console Gaming: Honestly, this game is not meant for PC. When I started playing and the camera started going all over the place, I quit, plugged in my controller, and resumed. It does have an option to turn down the mouse sensitivity, but I didn't try it. It's much better with a controller, so I stuck with that. Since it is, it makes me feel this game was really meant for console.  The Good: -The graphics are great, and I was playing on all low. I liked the idea of the plot of being a captive slave and escaping. The main character guy cracks me up because he reminds me of a monkey and a big cat cross-breed. -The combat is action-packed, something I normally don't like, but it was so similar to fighting games that I felt right at home. The main character feels a lot like playing Kilik or Seung-Mina from Soul Caliber IV, so if you're good at playing them, the main character will feel very familiar.    He uses a staff weapon just like them, but is more agile and faster than Seung-Mina.   -The characters look amazing and cool. -I really liked the main character guy's personality. He seems like a very likable guy, and is caring despite his rough look.  The Bad: -Like other reviews, the linear gameplay is very noticeable.  -The hand-holding and inability to fail while maneuvering makes it feel like a game for beginners despite the edgy and shiny look (and being on normal difficulty).  -The game's save system is based on checkpoints and autosaves without the ability to save at your leisure - and it's game-breaking. As I saw the girl run while escaping, I tried going after her to have my game clunk around and skip-ahead like a skipping DVD when the little autosave icon showed up. I thought it was because it was loading the background and effects since the game is quite detailed, but I was wrong. It does this at every autosave checkpoint, and I have to sudenly stop what I'm doing and wait for it to pass like nausea. -Even with switching to a controller, the camera does as it pleases. You can move around the camera yourself to get a better view, but it still doesn't seem possible to get the angle right without running away from where you want to go, then make a circle, and come back. And it's still facing the wrong direction from where you're trying to go. -The lady companion is annoying. She's always scared,    didn't help the main character when she was able and he had a chance of dying, and then she put a helmet on my guy character that causes his pain so she could control him   . Yeah, screw her. :P",

I tried every timing and combination and still I never could get it to work. Throughout the whole game!  A criminally overlooked gem.

I planned to play this for half an hour, just to check it out, but the story and characters grabbed me and didn't let go. Even now, I actually want to go back and continue to find out what's going on...  The gameplay, however, is rather lazy. But I'm pretty sure you want this game for the story, not for the brawler combat, not for the 'Baby-Prince-of-Persia'-esque platforming (you can't miss a jump, you can't fall - I'm still wondering if you can even die in this game), not for the (not really) explorable post-apocalyptic New York.   Apart from the beautiful world and captivating story. There's not much to see here.   Bandai Namco is definitely a lazy company when it comes to ports. So far every game of theirs that I have tried, has the same issues that all come down to the developers being lazy c*nts wanting to make more money with as little effort as possible.

Trip, a technologically savvy young woman has been imprisoned by a slave ship but manages to escape using her mental prowess. Monkey, a strong, brutish loner and fellow prisoner also gets free by virtue of his raw power and brawn. Trip quickly realizes that Monkey is her ticket to freedom and is her only hope to survive her perilous journey back home. She hacks a slave headband and fits it on Monkey, linking them together. If she dies, he dies and her journey has now become his. ENSLAVED centers on the complex relationship between the two main characters. Players take on the role of Monkey, utilizing a mix of combat, strategy and environmental traversal to ensure he and Trip survive the threats and obstacles that stand in the way of their freedom.",

            "review_text": "'would follow Trip across the wastelands again' - 8.5/10  Enslaved: Odyssey to the West (EOW) is a mixed bag. On the one hand it is visually stunning, well written, action adventure and on the other it is a lazy port with repetative gameplay.  I think it is fair to say that if the two main protaganists and their relationship do not grab you from the start then there is little point you playing any further. If however, like me, you find yourself genuinely enjoying the characters as they struggle their way across some rather lovely post apocolyptic cityscapes then this game is well worth seeing through to the end.  The strong points of this game are the main characters (and Piggsy, when you meet him) and they way you have to use both of them to progress. Trip (the girl) is not a playable character but instead functions much the same way as Elizabeth in Bioshock: Infinite. She is on hand to hack doors, climb through small gaps that Monkey cannot, and offer advice on progression. She never feels like a lame duck and having her along for company is most enjoyable.  Monkey himself is a joy to control and even with mouse and keyboard it is easy to perform some precision acrobatics and fighting skills.  The world itself is really well presented and there are some wonderful set pieces throughout.  Unfortunately it is at this point that many of the games flaws become apparent. Firstly, the camera; it hates you. It wants to b helpful by turning every moment into a cinimatic 'mood shot' but all it does is frustrate and annoy.  The combat, though satisfying and responsive, is repetative to the extreme. There is little variety in the animations and moves and the lack of diversity in mobs becomes tedious all to quickly.  The puzzle levels are a breath of fresh air after the combat and I would have preferred more of this.  The graphics are great when you ar standing still but on the move, even on my gaming PC behemoth, there is screen tear and lag aplenty. Likewise the areas, though very pretty, also become repetative.  It is such a shame that the game mechanics get in the way of what is arguably one of the best story driven experiences to have on PC. I do recommend you buy this game (i got it for £3 in a sale, bargain) but i would treat it more as an interactive adventure than a full game.  With a bit more variety and polish this could have been great. The story and character relationship kept me coming back but there is little incentive to revisit.  9.4 hours to complete is hardly epic either.  ",

Myself, I was underwhelmed. The story was pretty okay, and the acting was pretty okay. It wasn't bad, but I wasn't overly impressed.  What I really didn't get was the gameplay, in the sense that I didn't truly feel like I was 'playing' anything. I felt like an actor being led around by the nose, just hitting marks in order to advance the narrative. Outside of boss battles, combat seemed like very little more than just mashing the same buttons until the enemies were neutralized. Further, I felt like Monkey's acrobatic movement capabilities were mostly wasted on environmental traversal that was surprisingly linear and 'spoonfed' to the player. At the same time, I still ended up frustrated in spots because I was playing on PC, and the 'hyper-scripted' interactions in the game seem to be built to only truly work well on consoles.  I don't want to be overly harsh to Ninja Theory and the other folks involved in the production. I do think they worked hard at producing a title with good production values. (There's some interesting stuff going on in terms of visual design, that's for sure.) To be frank, though, I get the strange feeling that what they would have preferred to make was a movie - but interactive media was what they could do, so they stayed with that.  In the end, my experience was that 'Enslaved' is a nominally interactive story that only gets real gameplay in a few, disjointed spots. It seems mostly meant to look pretty and tell its story, without truly asking the player to get a solid handle on actual mechanics.  I can acknowledge that the above might not be your experience, though. Lots of people like this title, and that definitely speaks in rebuttal to my own feelings about 'Enslaved.'",

It's an entertaining melee/climbing sort of thing with solid enough combat mechanics and a fluid climbing system where you mostly just chill and watch the acrobatics (generally you can't fall). It has a decent story as random action games go, and the dialogue/acting is rather good (e.g. Andy Serkis plays the protagonist). The setting is postapocalyptic, but this time it's not a barren wasteland - you find New York overtaken by lush plant life, for instance. Some of the enviroments are beautiful despite its age (it's a PS3/X360 game from 2010).  The game plays better with a console controller, except for the shooting parts (you get a ranged attack with very limited ammo), which become a real pain in the ♥♥♥. There's also a couple of annoying chase sections. Generally it's an easy game.  So nothing revolutionary, no replay value (fully linear), but it's a good somewhat cinematic title with respectable writing and acting, good for a playthrough. I recommend it if you like the genre in general.  The 'Premium Edition' on Steam comes with 3 DLC skins that give significant passive buffs (but can only be used after finishing the game once, unless you edit some .ini files yourself) and a shorter story mode with a more comical tone where you control a side character from the main game.",

            "review_text": "A random 3rd person action game I picked up because of praises by single reviewers (even though the average ratings were, well, average). It's an entertaining melee/climbing sort of thing with solid enough combat mechanics and a fluid climbing system where you mostly just chill and watch the acrobatics (generally you can't fall). It has a decent story as random action games go, and the dialogue/acting is rather good (e.g. Andy Serkis plays the protagonist). The setting is postapocalyptic, but this time it's not a barren wasteland - you find New York overtaken by lush plant life, for instance. Some of the enviroments are beautiful despite its age (it's a PS3/X360 game from 2010).  The game plays better with a console controller, except for the shooting parts (you get a ranged attack with very limited ammo), which become a real pain in the ♥♥♥. There's also a couple of annoying chase sections. Generally it's an easy game.  So nothing revolutionary, no replay value (fully linear), but it's a good somewhat cinematic title with respectable writing and acting, good for a playthrough. I recommend it if you like the genre in general.  The 'Premium Edition' on Steam comes with 3 DLC skins that give significant passive buffs (but can only be used after finishing the game once, unless you edit some .ini files yourself) and a shorter story mode with a more comical tone where you control a side character from the main game.",

            "review_text": "I am on chapter 9 with 5 hours played, I like this game.  One problem i have with this game are due to the controls, which are not surfaced for some moves, for instance i had to google how  to use the stun hit, because it doesn't say in game. And sometimes the controls not responsive. Sometimes i would be in a fight and try to run and my analogue  stick ( i use a xbox controller ) would not respond for a second.  My other problem, is more with the climbing, which this game relies on heavily, they do highlight the polls, and some climbable objects,  but not all of them. They also do not highlight them too well, its a shiny effect type of thing from the original uncharted. I wish they would  have used a eagal vision type of thing.  My third, very minor, nit pick problems are the camera angles change your controls sometimes, this also happens in DmC: Devil May Cry, which i  see as a more analogue comparison, seeing as Ninja theory made both. The pre-rendered cutsenes look like they were made with 3d software from 1999, and  rendered to a gif. Also sometimes the animations arnt very smooth, this isn't usually a problem until the game makes you zoom into your 'AI partner' ( not really an AI partner, more of a highly scripted partner ) and you see the animations up close.  What i like about it...  This game has deep characters, which i think Ninja Theory actually dose very well. Their seems to be a character arch, but seeing as im  only on chapter 9, i cant tell you how it ends.  The world they created is interesting, and i want to find out where it ends. As much as they chalk up to 'Video Games' AKA a magic hoverboard that only works sometimes, it all works within the story, and they are very good at propositioning my questions, such as 'why dose that only work here'.  The Story is good, no spoilers.  Overall, I usually don't finish games, I actually might finish this one.  EDIT: After finishing this game at 8 hours, i want to say, i still agree, with my earler review, the boss fights can be frustrating when they make you jump around, and the story is OMG worth it.",

Climbing around is really quite fluid, but nothing spectacular. With it being on rails (IE, you are not gonna fall off a platform) you can get stuck on the odd railing or object for a second, especially in places where the camera changes - yes, it has sections of fixed cameras. These often have you accidentally backtracing for a second till you revert back to the camera change point.   The variety of enemies could have been expanded and a few more weapon options could have been added, the combat is not too shabby, but it's a standard '3 hit then heavy blow' till later on.

The enemies are very well done and the challenge does ramp up towards the end (though it's a very easy playthrough on Normal -- next time I'll definitely play it on Hard mode because Normal doesn't provide any challenge whatsoever in my experience). But what you should play this game for is the story. It's very rare I've found a game that is so expansive (for a linear game, at any rate). The environments are varied and the game never gets stale from the opening chapter to the very end. Some deadly boss battles too, which is a great plus and keeps it engaging. But, the story is just breathtaking. There are few games that've left me speechless and fewer still that've left me thinking about whether or not I did the right thing at the end.

As I look back and wonder what makes it feel so good, there's really only one big reason: the actor Andy Serkis and his performance. Serkis plays the player character, lending both his voice and motions, and that really is what carries the game.  Serkis made his character likable and got me engaged and invested, interested in what will happen to the character next. After my initial infatuation over the game's colourful appearance, clever premise and certain small, wonderful gameplay decisions, my feelings settled to be all about doing whatever busywork the game wanted me to do as fast as possible so I would get to the next good bit. Thankfully it's less tedious that it sounds. My experience boiled down to constantly looking forward to whatever event would be happening or encounter coming accross just around the corner. Anything that triggered dialogue, made the characters interact and Serkis do something entertaining was a joy. The story mostly progressed at a brisk enough pace to not let the cycle of anticipation, excitement and satisfaction completely settle down. Gameplay segments were - with a notable exception or two - short enough to not form a frustrating obstacle between the player and progression, even if a number of retries might have been required at times. They're largely just an inconvenient speedbumb.  The game's not bad, it's well crafted and mostly has a ring of quality to it, but it's also not very bold. It's got the groundwork, but it does nothing with it. The premise of the player character being enslaved, after being set up as a cornerstone of the game in an initial cutscene, is left unused. The game starts soon feel monotonous and flavourless, spreading its content too thin for too long, but the small juicy bits of Serkis are sprinkled densely enough that I didn't feel like quitting before the end.   In the end, the game's enjoyable but also forgettable. I had good time with it for a while, but after it was over and it was time to put it down, it didn't really leave me longing or thinking about it much afterwards.  If you are in a position to pick between different platforms, a console version of this game might be a better bet. The PC port smells like it was done in a hurry with no budget. Prompts guiding which button to press next lie, the game crashed a few times, resolution is capped, pitiful number of settings and so on.",

The gameplay is good, combat works nice, but it is a bit repetetive. The level design is tunneled, but it is really well made.   The story is good, even if a bit cliche at times, but at least it does not take it self too seriously.   Then there is the cloud, a freaky hoverbordish floatin disc, that the main character get to use from time to time, and each time it is really fun.

            "review_text": "TL:DR pretty good game with a decent story and likeable characters in Trip and Monkey. The gameplay revolves around climbing and close combat that isnt too bad itself but gets a bit boring towards the end of the game.   Enslaved is loosely based on the Chinese story Journey to the West. Its set in the future where most of humanity has been wiped out and the survivors live in fear of mechs who capture or kill people. The main character Monkey finds himself imprisoned on a slave ship at the beginning of the game when the games other main character Trip, attempts an escape. The ensuing chaos allows Monkey to also attempt to escape as the ship crashes. Monkey awakens to find Trip has fitted a slave headband that will kill him if he doesnt do what she says. Her only order for Monkey is to get her back to her home.   The game has you playing as Monkey with Trip as an AI controlled companion. Most of the game revolves around climbing structures and platforms, quite similar to the climbing in the Uncharted series, with a bit of combat against the mechs where Monkey uses a retractable staff. I quite liked the story and Trip and Monkey are also both likeable characters as their initial uneasy alliance blossoms into a friendship.  This game was overlooked a bit (a bit undeservedly) on its initial console release but it is a pretty good game even though the gameplay gets a bit stale towards the end though. This edition also features the DLC Pigsy's Perfect 10 which is also a decent add on where you play another character from the main game Pigsy with a more stealth focused type of gameplay.  Good points: - Enjoyable story and Trip and Monkey are both likeable characters. - the companion AI for Trip is actually quite good. Games with an AI companion can be hit or miss but they get it right here. - I loved the level design particularly the earlier levels in the ruins of New York. Rather than go for the grim dark crumbling ruins of other post-apocalyptic games the ruins in Enslaved are full of colourful plant life as nature reclaims the city and it does lookreally nice. -The Pigsys Perfect 10 dlc story is quite a good add on which mixes up the gameplay from the main game with a bigger focus on stealth.  Bad points: - There is very little variety of enemies particularly bosses. Most of the bosses are the same couple of mechs which you'll fight a few times throughout the game. - Combat mostly boils down to button bashing with the fast and heavy attacks. You can unlock other attacks but theres never much cause to use them. - The camera is a bit finicky at times as it will suddenly snap to a new angle as you move around a level and it can be a bit disorientating.",

            "review_text": "Combat: I think the combat is best described as solid. It offers enough attacks and enemy-types to keep you entertained, but it is a bit simplistic. There is really not much more to say about it.  Climbing: On the positive side the climbing is very well animated and the sceneries look good. Unfortunately, it is impossible to die. This somehow takes the tension out of the climbing-sections and more than ones i caught myself just mashing the jump button until I hid the correct direction. So climbing is basically a distraction from the action-based combats.  Camera: Maybe you wonder why the camera is its own bulletpoint. The reason is: the camera control/movement is awful.  The camera is way too close behind the character, there is no lock-on mechanism and most of the time it feels like the camera is delibarately moving away from the enemy you are attacking. In the sum it is near impossible to have an overview of the battlefield or even to aim for one specific enemy. Even most games in the late 90's (when 3D-gaming was something new) had better camera movement than this. Seriously, who ever decided the game can be published with this camera should never be involved in game developement ever again. Yes, it's that bad.  Graphics/Presentation: I like that instead of modeling a brownish desert-like wasteland the developers were going for an overgrown-by-plants like wasteland. So everthing looks really nice and colorful. Another thing that has to be mentioned is that the animations are very well done. Especially, the faces of the characters show an impressive amount of emotions.  Story: For me it is a mixed back. The overall story is interesting enough and its presentation is, as mentioned before, really good. Unfortunately, the story shifts its tone half way through the story and trys to introduce some goofy/cheesy humour, which imho doesn't work out very well. Another problem is that there are to many cut-scenes in-between the battles. For me it just broke the game-flow if fights are constantly interrupted.  Summary: Enslaved is a casual game with a good presentation. Casual here is ment without any negative connotation. So if you are looking for a nice distraction and can live with the atrocious camera behaviour I think I can give a recommendation. Just don't expect too much.",

Pros - Gorgeous environments - Engaging story, characters, and excellent voice acting - Twist ending - Modern near-AAA platformer (a rarity in this generation of games) - Upgrade tree (if a bit shallow) - Boss Fights (call me old fashioned, but I like this)  Cons - Shallow gameplay (it's no button masher, but definitely not complex) - Lack of enemy variety - Zero replayability (definitely story-driven, no multiple endings or changes for multiple playthroughs.) - Weak DLC - Some minor graphical issues (banding) in certain cutscenes when played at 1080p. Can be easily fixed and only a little distracting. Overall a great port.)",

Prior to the Steam Summer Sale 2014, I had never heard of this game before.   The combat and puzzles tend to be a bit lackluster and eventually feel a bit linear. There are some situations where the camera becomes fixed and the viewing angle becomes troublesome, but definitely not a deal breaker.  The champions of this game are the story, the character development, and the voice acting. Most probably don't know that the story is loosely based on the Chinese tale, Journey to the West.   The environment is such a mystery – a world long after some unnamed apocalypse, where vegetation has reclaimed the once polluted, noisy urban setting. Somewhere in the vast expanse of this world are clues to what’s really going on. There are subtle hints of some place out west, where slaves are taken and never return.  The simple yet believable dialogue conveys intriguing moments of real emotion between Monkey and Trip, and combined with their surprisingly human expressions, gives weight and depth to their characters which tends to be rare in videogames nowadays. In addition, the game doesn't seem to give justice behind it's writer Alex Garland (28 Days Later.)  The character development would not have been complete without it's voice actors, specifically the protagonist's, whose voice was recorded by none other than the great Andy Serkis.  All of the aspects I've mentioned come together in a way that makes Enslaved feel not quite like anything I've played before. Sure, the gameplay in itself isn't exactly original, but by adding substance through characterization, a world full of history, and those small moments that pull you in to the story, it turned out be something quite special.",

My devotion to the story was so great that when i accidentally skipped a cutscene at the end of a chapter, I replayed the entire chapter to see the cutscene again. I also rewatched the epilogue a couple of times because philosophy was going through my head, and I wanted to make sure I didn't miss anything. Great story  The game was certainly limited in terms of controls, I had to open up the ini files to figure out some of the key bindings for the ol' mouse and keyboard. I recommend a controller, it would work better I think.  Combat is a little shallow, especially if you didn't look up some of the key Bindings, but it can be fun and challenging, and the bosses are good.   Its a good game with a great story that satisfied me, therefore I recommend it.",
