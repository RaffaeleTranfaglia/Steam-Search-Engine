            "review_text": "All I have to add to the other positive reviews is if this game has good controller support for those without a dedicated racing rig. I can't answer for all the different pads out there but with my 360 controller the answer is a resounding YES!  The trucks are, surprisingly, quite easy to manage with a controller even with all driving assists off. Also, you don't need to muck about with too many controller settings except: 1) Map your controls accordingly (this is the only area where the game setup falls down, even choosing a 360 pad in the settings will give incorrect inputs for steering etc...),  2) Put speed sensitivity up to around 70% and put a bit of deadzone in for the analog stick, probably around 5-10% depending on your pad.  3) If the steering is too sensitive you can take the x-axis sensitivity down to 0% and have good control, this is what I am currently running it at.  Just remember, this is a sim racing game, so you do have to drive appropriately. It will take some time to get used to, but the reward is worth it when you nail it.  I have been playing this game quite a bit since before it was released on Steam. Don't let my short playing time displayed so far fool you :)",

Beautiful trucks with modified engines and drivetrains, extensive body aerokits. I hope that Reiza will continue Formula Truck series with new seasons. Highly recommended simulation.",

            "review_text": "I've played far more hours of this game then what shows in Steam and just like every other Reiza product, recommend it fully. If you like trucks and you like racing, then you'll like this game. If you're on the fence about it, go try the 60 minute demo on Reiza's website and see what you think. The trucks are different to drive of course. You'll need to stop sooner and get a feel for how the trucks handle. This title is classic Reiza though. The handlng is well done, the tracks are well done, and the force feedback is just right. I normally use a Logitech Driving Force Pro, but hooked up an XBOX 360 controller and it works just fine as far as controlling the car. The only negative I can come up with for this review iis that I'd love to see more tracks and trucks but I'm sure that Reiza is working on that. All in all, a great game at a great price.",
