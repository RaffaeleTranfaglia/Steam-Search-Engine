However, the game could have been better if the awareness played a bigger role and it had longer gameplay.  I recommend it because the price isn't very high, although some would say it's too short even for that price.In other words: The only real downside of this game is its very brief duration. But it's a fun experience nonetheless.",

The only downside is the game is very short. I would still highly recomend it if you like games that make you think. Though I do hope they add more at some point.",
