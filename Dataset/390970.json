He constantly makes racist statements that don't lead into anything (one time he just straight up says that Saratovs are untrustworthy and that's his whole thought) he complains about everything, is vehemetly against Television in the same way a Vegan is against steak. He reminds me of a ♥♥♥♥♥ who finishes her turn and, when coming home, turns on porn and invites her neighbour for &lt;&lt;a horse ♥♥♥♥ of tea&gt;&gt;.  Also are ghouls a thing in Russia?",

            "review_text": "First of all: There is no horror to this story..  Well.. there might be some elements, but it's more what's going on inside the mind of a sleep deprived guy.  The story itself is pretty bad, but the different storylines have some nice 'winks' to each other. Especially the eights ending when unlocked is not bad at all, since it is an ending that makes you think. That one ending shows you how 'creating your own reality' actually works and shows a way to a better live. So philosofical speaking, only that one ending is good.  I didn't mind the bad translation too much. The story makes sense, yes, there are some spelling and grammar mistiks, but you must be really lacking English skills if you don't get it. Only bad part is that there are about 2 slides that are not translated yet, but that might come later.  The story is very short, regardless what path you take. The function to skip to the next decsision is very welcome, since the story would get really boring soon. Since the story itself is not very good and very short, I would not recommend this game.  The most terrible thing is: They tried to enlengthen the gameplay by adding a terrible 'mini-game' into the game. This mini-game doesn't work very well and costs you way more time than the actual game if you want to complete all achievements. They game would actually be better off with this game just being an easter-egg in stead of actually becoming the biggest factor of this game.  Did I already mention how bad this mini-game is programmed? If you fire, your ship moves. You auto-fire almost always multiple shots. And even if an enemy ship or bullet has past you, you can still hit it by flying over it. All this makes it nearly implayable.  If you can get this game sheep, or possibly free.. It's nice to spend a few hours in it. Otherwise: Don't try.  (NB: My hours are way higher than I actually played the game, just to get all the trading cards).",

Plus the achivements... 3 achivements for playing the boring really hard Easter Egg game? Really?!  Plus that they want us to pay for this... There are tons of free VNs out there that are ways better than this...",

It's really time consuming - and you dont dare to make 1 mistake. 500 points takes about ~10 Minutes i guess + its really hard to get even to &gt; 1000 ...   5/10 cause cards, achievements + cheap ;)",
