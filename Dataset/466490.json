            "review_text": " Princess Isabella: The Rise of an Heir  is the last game in the titular series, and probably the weakest game in means of gameplay dynamic, puzzle choices and story elaboration to begin with. It was in the Steam Store for ages alongside other two games before Artifex Mundi got the rights from Gogii Games to remaster. The old original game - a cheesy, yet okay conclusion to otherwise beautiful series - is sadly not acquirable through the Steam Store anymore. This is the remaster arranged by Artifex Mundi, and even though that I'm a fan of the publisher, I'll go out on a limb and declare that they didn't even try to make a decent job here.  Spoiler Alert! Isabella's last battle with the witch didn't end happily. Yes, she managed to rescue Bella with the aid of her companions, yet her momentary distraction costed her everything. The witch turned her into a stone statue, Prince Adam completely lost his mind and the kingdom has fallen under the tyrannical rule of the witch... Yet, in a silent and peaceful corner of the realm, three fairy godmothers and the dragon raised little Bella to be a capable wizardess just like her mother, for her to return and complete the deed that her mother failed to do so. Upon finally discovering Bella's location, the witch sends her hounds after Bella, and her hurry to clean this mess begins... Will there be a happily ever after, after all?  Let's start with the display options. The old original - just like previous games - was weaved out of pastel colors, dusty environments and all pictures carried an elegant shimmer. With new rendering of the images, filter and tone choices for colors got bolder and shinier. As a personal choice, I found that a bit of an unnecessary contrast with the original setting, lessening the atmosphere. Quoting from a friend's comment: 'Pictures look like Walt Disney threw up all over the place.' Well, that is kinda appropriate of a definition here. I usually adore Artifex Mundi's color choices, yet playing prior games it felt unfitting for Isabella series' elegance and naivety. Resolutions compared to the old game are marvelously better though, I won't lie. Art works and HOG scenes are much clearer, and it got a lot much easier to go through item fetching.  Some great annoyance on my part was that some voice acting got changed - to a lesser quality, surprisingly - and others are completely missing. Some character introduction scenes and other cutscenes are cut out, leaving small holes in the original plotline. The setting was overwhelmed with the concept of catholic evil to begin with - cleansing the evil out of all places that we run through, wickedly laughing villain, Eye of Sauron-ish watching eye of the witch, a curse so sticky that it takes 3 games to clean thoroughly - and not very original about it. Cutting out content leaves it fatally wounded. Sure, we are lucky that this is a collectorâ€™s edition which offers some bonus gameplay and references to older games, but I'd appreciate if I'd be able to see mandrake's introduction scene or hear the voice of the whale that resides on the beach.  HOG scenes got a heck lot of easier with lesser items to find on cleaner picture renderings. They are mostly redone with the same items. Puzzles are altered too; some getting ridiculously easier, others unnecessarily complicated. Item interface has also been changed with your wand being in dangerous proximity to hint button; just be warned. I do not recall whether there was a map or not, but I certainly hadn't any need for it. The environment itself is somewhat limited anyhow with a backtracking being mandatory.  Overall, this is most certainly not one of Artifex Mundi's better games, neither the best game in Isabella series anyhow. I could recommend the game only if you've played previous games and curious about what will happen to Isabella in the end. Even then, I recommend finding and playing the original through Big Fish Games.

            "review_text": "i don't see what all the negative reviews are about. Okay, the instructions on the color wheel puzzle are completely useless, and it _does_ have a few 'what the hell just happened?' moments, but other than that i'm finding it to be a decent HOPA, with mechanics i've not yet seen in a HOPA (e.g. the wand's abilities) and a nice atmosphere. The graphics quality is slightly sub-par for modern HOPAs (but better than the Time-whatever series), and the video cutscene quality is notably sub-par, but the voiceovers and music are well done. Some players complain about the generic names of the characters (Fairy, Owl, etc.), but i actually prefer such names over arbitrary made-up names which few players can remember. Challenging? Not particularly, but it's colorful, has relaxing music, and suitable for casual gamers. It's certainly short, though - not quite 3.5 hours for the main story plus unlockable add-on adventure.",

            "review_text": "I had played the first two games after buying them both at the same time when they were on sale, and wasn't impressed but the cliffhanger ending of the second game made me purchase this one. I honestly wished I had stopped at the second game because while the first two games were very simple both plot-wise and in the mini games, this was even worse. I had higher hopes because of the different publisher - I'd played many Artifex Mundi games before and generally enjoyed them. This was not even close to their usual standards. Numerous misspelling or grammatical errors in the dialogue text. The plot was even more contrived to the point of being laughable. But worse, it made no sense. It's a point-and-click game so I expect some level of contrived gameplay, but the fact that you were finding portrait pieces in places where there shouldn't have been any throughout the entire game was eye-rolling.   If you enjoyed the first two games and want closure, pick this up only if it's on super sale. Otherwise, give it a pass.",
