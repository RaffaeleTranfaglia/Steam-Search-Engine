            "review_text": "I don't quite remember what drove me to the Sient Hunter series. I think I saw them on Steam one day and thought to myself 'hey cool, submarines!'. Before that moment I had very little interest in the subject and even less knowlege. To my understanding: a submarine was just a boat that traveled over and under water with a periscope for looking around. I know now that they are so much more than that.   A submarine is a complicated piece of machinery that is designed to stealthily ambush enemy merchant ships. They are no match for destroyers and dive bombers are a constant nightmare. Above water, in daylight, they are sitting ducks. Underwater they are blind as bats, with only sound to guide their eyes. Most of your torpedoes will be duds, and if enemy war ships become aware of your presence your only hope is to submerge and leave the area quickly; and pray that the depth charges don't sink your boat.   There is a reason why German u-boats were called 'iron coffins'. It's because they had the highest casualty rate during WW2.  In Silent Hunter 4 (wolves of the pacific) you get to play on the American side as a submariner in the pacific theater of the war. With the U-boat Missions addon you can play the German side in the same theater. That expansion updates the game to 1.5, so it is required in order to use a lot of the mods for the game. There is one mod in particular that expands the default German campaign into the Atlantic and North Sea areas; definitely a must if you prefer that side of the conflict. Or just get Silent Hunter 2, 3, or 5 (all u-boat games). Silent Hunter 4 is unique because it's the first game since Silent Hunter 1 that lets players command American subs. Unfortunately Japanese subs are not playable, which would have been a huge bonus.  I think the general consensus of this game is: you will either love it or hate it. I've seen people putting the game down either for some annoying bugs (and they are annoying) or simply because they don't prefer the submarine warfare in the Pacific theater. Personally, I like it. The American subs are unique in their own way, but not completely different from the German u-boats. The threat is still there, but the Pacific Ocean is a vast place. You may find yourself traveling around for what seems an eternity before engaging in any type of action. To me, this is the only drawback of the game. Most of the bugs and failings of the game can be improved with mods, however; and there are plenty of them online.  The entire Silent Hunter series is great, and every game in the list is a good submarine sim. If you are just looking for an arcade experience and want to jump right into the action, then you can do that. However, if you want an ultra-realistic simulator then turn up the realism settings and dive into the plethora of game-changing mods that are available online. This game is a great entry for anyone even remotely interested in the subject. You won't learn everything about submarine life, but you will walk away with a new found appreciation for it!",

            "review_text": "Silent Hunter IV, along with Silent Hunter III, are great Submarine simulation games. The tenseness when invading Midway in the U-Boat Missions campaign, sinking an Aircraft Carrier, a light Cruiser, and a Battleship, all while being shot at by Torpedo Boats and having Bombers pass over me was a very interesting experience.  The controls may take some time to grasp, so I would suggest playing the tutorial missions if you are new to this series like I am.",

Take on a number of mission ranging from regular patrols to photo recon and more. Do you have the skill to evade depth charges, attack convoys, raid harbours and sink ships to help bring the mighty Empire of Japan to its knees?   Side Note: I highly recommend mods for improved gameplay and realism, all mods do require the SH4 U-Boat Missions add-on to function unless the mod functions on a previous version of SH4.",

            "review_text": "I give this game a 6.5/10.  PROS: As my only Submarine simulator in my inventory, I will say my first impressions with this game were very good. I got hooked on sailing the pacific ocean, stalking my enemy before destroying their ships and forcing them to the bottom of the sea. Learning how to use the crew, their watch schedule and rotation, and watching them get promoted and recieve awards for their actions was the most satisfying part of this game for me. Each submarine performs differently and the missions you recieve can have very tense moments that had me sweating.  CONS: This game is not very well optimized and using time acceleration can be very dangerous as enemy ships and planes will appear of out no where and sink your ship. Also, after hours of gameplay all of my save files suddenly became corrupt and I am completely unable to play the game now. I would look into what went wrong, but I am playing other games now.  If the game had been fixed at some point during it's life then I have no doubt it would be one of the best Submarine games on the market.   If you are interested in this game, buy it when it is on sale and have fun. Just be warned that there are many problems that may make your experience aggravating.",

In contrast to SH3, this looks worse in some aspects graphically, which goes to say alot considering the improved graphics are just about the only thing that is marketing this game. It's horribly arcadish, and the damage system is laughable. Despite the boasting about holes letting water into damaged ships, you frequently end up with Japanese merchants sporting huge portions of their hulls ripped open as though a giant had mangled them, but despite that and the fact that you've just put 3 torpedos into an average size freighter, they keep going, even though their decks are submerged and their listing hard to the side. Seriously, how did the developers think? SH3 would've done marvelous at being the successor of this game, not the predecessor.",
