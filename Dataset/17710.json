            "review_text": "I got this game on the 26th from a friend. I played 2 hours that night in single player... I made the mistake the next day of playing multiplayer. 11 hours later I looked up to see that It was almost 10 PM and I'd lost my entire day... There is up to around 3 servers with a respectable amount of people at any given time, so it's not hugely popular, but the sale is bringing in more and more people.  ABOUT THE GAME  Difficulty- It's fairly confusing if you're new to real time strategies to play as the commander, but the tutorials are very helpful. As a troop it's fairly easy to pick up as it's basically counter strike or a newer call of duty game. Technically this fits in the category I guess- the bots are beyond stupid. Half of them just try to jump up to unreachable places until they are shot. This, however, is hilarious.  Variation- The classes are amazing. You can't switch weapons like in call of duty, you use whatever ones come with your class. While some find this annoying, I think it levels out the game and makes it better. There are currently four types of troops with up to three or four classes for each. Changing even just a class can change how you play, or if your team wins or not. And if you get bored of just shooting people, apply to be the commander and play it like a tower defence.  Level of fun- OOOVVEEEERRRRR 9000!!!!!!!!! (sorry not sorry ;D)  Some other pros- There are people who use voice chat to be tactical, and awesome and stuff. I have so far only found one annoying person. The weapons as I said are balanced well. Most servers don't allow friendly fire, but it is an option.  Overall this is an amazing game. How I've been describing it is as a super tactical version of counter strike (YOU CAN BE A FRIKKIN INVISIBLE NINJA) but that doesn't do it justice. Nuclear Dawn is so far my favorite FPS (I like being a drone not the leader personally). It's not just I shot Bob, Bob grenaded me, I knifed George, Jeff shot me... You can be a sneaky ninja, you can be an engineer and repair the buildings, you can flame thrower the crap out of people, you can snipe; you can use a rocket launcher, or a pistol; you can just be a soldier or you can lead an army.  10/10 Wasted my whole day and many more to come.  P.S. Devastator196 is brother so if you see him make sure you get a head shot on that fool. ;D",

I kinda like it, only actively played the Stealth class so far.  Let's start of with stuff i don't really like:  - Hit markers are somewhat off sometimes. Shooting right on the body but no hit? seems legit. - Turrets... Turrets everywhere! - Rockets...grenades... ♥♥♥♥ my life! - Servers are...empty?! i usually only se one server with a lot of people, the rest is empty  On the good side: - Heavy siege battles - People don't trashtalk on ingame voice (at least i havent experienced that so far) - Good positioning (as sniper that is) gets rewarded  - sniper shots usually don't oneshot (except for against snipers^^) but can be set up fairly quickly and the stealth part gives you nice possibilities in duels",

Teamwork is very important in this game as the flow of the game chages as well as the current objectives change too (such as defend this area, capture this resourse point etc). Probably more teamwork is involved in this game than tf2, but if you really feel like it you can just run around and kill people like other FPS games. It also has the commander role, the one person who builds all the buildings for your team and plays on an overview map. The commander role ist like playing a RTS but all the units are actual players. It is the unique blend of FPS and RTS that make this game just a blast to play and every time you play it is different than the last. It is a very unique and fun game that I highly reccomend.",

            "review_text": "When I first bought this game I thought it was RTS mixed in with FPS... meaning you could go from a RTS view point to being a single guy as an FPS view... again wasn't it but slightly similar. There is one designated commander (RTS) player while the rest have to take the role as infantry (FPS).   If you've played natural selection, it's slightly similar to this. You start a game needing to be either a commander or a player (the nice thing about this game that yes you can play against the computer). The commander builds outposts to either provide more weapons, turrets, armory, health and upgrade stations. The players themselves attack and attempt to move forward and gain tactical advantage. The FPS portion of the game is actually quite fluid and visually appealing. I also have to give it to them, they put grenades into the game! Any game that does this I have to give them props. Having more options as a gamer is always welcomed, but the basic of a gun and a grenade I believe in a necessity. Zooming in is also possible with most weapons. Although being a good FPS player will advance most of your team, if the other team has a damn good commander, you may be out of luck. A strong commander is definitely needed for a victory. I should also mention there are different classes to choose from such as stealth assassin or sniper, assault marksmen, riflemen, and grenadier, support engineer, medic or BBQ (I'll leave this for you to explore), and exos which are almost like a super class.   The visuals from and FPS and even an RTS stand point is rock solid. Although the game is not that old, it's buffering abilities and graphics on either view is still phenomenal. From an RTS stand point, everything is nicely laid out and easy to manage. There is a grid view system in place to help the commander put buildings in place. HUD on either perspective/view is really easy on the eyes and are another fluid design in my opinion. Passing by these buildings that are being put up in FPS mode is absolutely a beautiful design. Sounds are neat and although not extremely diverse, you won't be hearing the same boom's or gun shots over and over.   I will give it a high rating as it attempts to be a hybrid and pushes the gaming genre boundaries.

Gameplay, very different. While you have real humans fighting it out on the battlefield, you can sit in your seat and place structures in a RTS environment. Maybe you will even experience the pain of someone stabbing you in the back when you sit in the command structure. Yes, it does happen often.  Shame the funding and support started to dry up, this game will always be one that I can't turn down to someone. The title has sort of 'come and gone' so to say.

Definitely not a k/d focused game at all. Great if you want a good cooperative experience.

One of the more enjoyable shooters i have played this year. ND is a unique twist on the fps/rts hybrid model. To sum it up, each team has a commander which plays rts style. everyone else plays as a class based fps game. There are 4 classes and each one has a sub class to it as well. Each class feels good and has its own strengths and weakness. The commander portion is a blast, but does have a bit of a learning curve. The gameplay beats out a lot of AAA titles that have been released as of late. My only complaint is that its a tad lite on content atm. With only 1 game mode and 6 maps, it does leave a bit to be desired. However, the developers are exellent with communicating to the community, vehicles and more maps/modes are on there way. For 25$, you will get your money out of whats already here. I cant stress this enough, communication and teamwork are key to this game.",

The FPS gameplay is your standard shooter, point crosshairs at baddies, destroy enemy structures and so forth.   However, one thing really bothers me about this game: How come there aren't that many people playing? The game is fun, and with the addition of trading cards and Steamworks support, you'd think the game would be a little more popular. That's not to say there's absolutely nobody playing, while the community is small, it seems to be a very dedicated one. You should be able to makes a few friends pretty fast on here.

It only ends with you being spawn trapped as it rains down turrets of machineguns, rockets and flamethrowers as you realize there is a mad god out there that hates you.   The Starcraft Brood War Opening Cinematic honestly describes it perfectly, your the marine though :         YouTube™ Video:  Starcraft: Brood War Opening&nbsp;",

Ive spent about an hour playing just to see if i could get into it but because i really like the concept but it hasnt really sucked me in. It was on sale for super cheap so im no angry or anything, but you could say im a little disappointed. I thought this game was going to be awsome, based on the concept. Ill keep my eye on on it though because i feel like it might become really good one of these patches.",

Don't waste your money, Don't waste your time. Despite all the time i've putt in and despite the guide's i have made for this game, i will not change my opinion as long as the game remains this way.

All in all I think it’s a refreshing take on the genre.  ~~~~ 04/21/15 ~~~~~~ I have to change my recommended status, as I've found VERY few if any servers up recently. As I edit this, I'm am finding one server up in France, a few hours ago, there were no servers active. Still enjoy the gameplay, but if there is no one to play with I can't recommend paying for the game.",
