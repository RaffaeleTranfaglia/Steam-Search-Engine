            "review_text": "Blazblue Chronophantasma Extend is the third true installment of the Blazblue series. We can see a huge gameplay improvement from Continuum Shift and upgraded soundtrack from the previous two chapters. What really changed from these two chapters?   + The gameplay: They added a new mechanic called the 'Overdrive' which consist of 'powering up' our character for increased damage with the distortions (the super moves) replacing the classic burst. Some characters where buffed or nerfed and got new moves. The newcomers they are cool, I don't see anything wrong about them. + The soundtrack: Holy macaroni! They manage to create a even more awesome soundtrack from Calamity Trigger and Continuum Shift! + Story: I'm not going to spoil anything but if you didn't play the previous two games or watched the anime (don't do it it's ♥♥♥♥) there are two very short recaps of the games. But they don't help much. +- The story is a Visual Novel. I prefered they animated all scenes instead of using sprites. If you like VNs you won't bother reading the story - Online is... very poor... Sure there are some people doing lobbies but the ranked scene feels like it's dead. You have to be lucky to find someone at your level and... if you're a newbie... good luck heh +- The combo system is really fun! But... can be exploited for massive damage combos, which can be annoying if you're playing with a very good player. But doing one of these combos is really hard so you have to practise... A LOT. - The online needs his netcode to be fixed. If playing with someone with low fps it will be a lag fest - The balance: Some characters doesn't seems right, sure it wasn't a mess like Chronophantasma 1.0 but it needs to be fixed (probably they won't because they are focusing on the next Blazblue game) I've made a  Tier list  for fun because some characters are too strong for others. I've made that based on the  Eventhubs leaderboard  [www.eventhubs.com]  and the Gamefaqs forums   And so... Prepare your arcade stick and join the most weeabooish community of 2d fighters!",

            "review_text": "Pros: 1. Good netplay, I went to ranked match straight away and never had to wait to find a match. Only 1 match was laggy out of about 25 and that's because I forgot to set my connection quality restrictions. (Using a wired connection not wireless. Don't play fighting games on wireless if you can help it.) 2. Runs really well for me, constant 60 FPS at 1920x1080 (GTX 970). Game looks better in 'arcade' mode instead of 'widescreen'. 3. Comes with all of the DLC. 4. Has a great tutorial and challenge mode to teach you how to play the game and the characters. 5. Has a lot of content to offer besides multiplayer (looking at you SFV). Arcade, Story, training, Abyss, Unlimited mars, etc.  6. Character design and animation is top notch. 7. Every character has an OverDrive which allows for really unique combos.  Cons: 1. BlazBlue in general can be difficult to learn if you're new, and some people online are already good from PS4 version. 2. Highest resolution is 1920x1080, doesn't bother me but may be a con to some.

            "review_text": "BlazBlue: Chronophantasma Extend is the 'Ultimate Edition' of the 2012 arcade hit, BlazBlue: Chronophantasma and the third entry in the main series of BlazBlue games. It's a fast-paced fighting game which encouraces skill and quick calculating.   Key Features: -28 different playable characters most of which brings something different to the table -4-button based fighting system -Has an rather long story mode telling an anime-esque story in the style of a visual novel -Abyss mode allows you to go through gauntlets of enemies gaining upgrades along the way. Highly addictive  Pros: -Awesome story. Full of carefully written dialogue, big twists and emotional drama. It's also fully voiced in both english and japanese if you're not the reading type. -Whether you're a casual or a hardcore BlazBlue player there's something for you here. Abyss mode provides a more laid back experience as well as a good place to practice combos, tutorial mode and challenge mode lets low-ranking players become better the story is something everyone should experience no matter their skill level, online mode is of course another good training ground and finally unlimited mars mode which pits you against the most satanically difficult AI you'll ever see. -Beautiful spritework and backgrounds -Low initial difficulty curve for a fighting game. As long as you take the time to review the tutorial you should get the hang of things pretty quick -Great tutorials -Haven't done much netplay but my experience with it so far has been good. Mostly lagless, respectable opponents and a decent amount of people -Characters feel rather balanced as far as I can tell. None really seems overpowered -Amazing soundtrack -Contains a side story explaining the events in Calamity Trigger and Continuum Shift so new players aren't left in the dark. I do reccomend playing those if you want the full experience though  Cons: -The story mode can get a bit carried away with the story sometimes and occasionally forgets it's a game. As such there's a very high cutscene-to-gameplay ratio to the point where it could rival even Metal Gear. Don't look to the story mode for gameplay -Hard to get into if you're new to fighting games and don't know where to start. If you are new, start with tutorial, practice between each lesson and then move on to challenge mode to learn how to chain combos. There is something called stylish mode if you'd rather play the game casually which basically plays part of the game for you but where's the fun in that? -Story can get a bit overwhelming at times. They use alot of big words which originate from all over the world and it can get hard to keep track of what's what. If you forget what something is, check out the library which contains a bunch of short articles explaining characters and objects.   TL;DR BlazBlue Chronophantasma and the whole BlazBlue series as a whole is a bit of a niche franchise. You need to put alot of time into these games to fully understand them. Both in terms of story and gameplay. But once you get into it you will never get out. The captivating world and story keep me coming back to analyze, finding something new every time.   This game gets a 9/10",

        {
            "review_text": "Note: This review is mainly on the single-player content. Not that I eschew multiplayer normally, but the single-player just kept me busy enough!  Blazblue is best seen as a branch of the Guilty Gear series, mainly with the anime and manga influences turned up to - if you'll forgive me - 11. And like anime and manga, this is a vehicle for fanservice. Now, I don't just mean having ridiculously sexualized female characters, though it certainly doesn't lack for those, but in general trying to cater to everybody's tastes in over-the-top characters that are designed so in theory everybody has a favorite to hold up. This is, of course, why the story mode is a endless torrent of visual novel word vomit, so that every one of the 26 characters gets a moment to shine.  I'm getting off track, though, so let's talk about the fighting. It's good. If there's a criticism I'd level with it, it's the usual tendency for fighting games to have feature cruft stack up, from Crush Triggers to Overdrives to Rapid Cancels and actually mastering all of it is literally akin to learning a language. Thankfully, at least at the casual to afficiando levels, mastering every system isn't necessary, but if you go cross-eyed when a game tries to get you to take terms like 'Guard Libra', this may be overwhelming. Where the complexity shines is in the characters, though, that each get their own subsystem that really makes them feel unique, with very little cloning in effect. In addition, almost every one of these systems is interesting, and each character contains a lot of depth. Of course, that gets back to my original point about the appeal of Blazblue - shoving characters in your face until you click with at least one. Some require a level of motion mastery that gets downright farcical - Bullet requiring a 1080p motion for one of her super attacks (I'm sorry, Distortion Drives) comes to mind - but most you can manage basic mastery without overt effort if you've played a fighting game seriously in the past twenty years. The end bosses aren't even too much of a headache, which is a rarity. But they aren't fair. Let's not get too hopeful, right?  The story is a mess of anime garbage and word salad (Ars Magus, Hierarchal City, Continuum Shift, etc.), even including an extensive glossary, summaries of the story up until this point, and literal lessons on the game's lore. I do enjoy it as an ongoing anime soap opera, but you ain't getting more than relatively simple characters who will hit their character beats like a dead horse and a lot of melodrama. That being said, it's still fun if unsophisticated, though some of the humor in the gag reels can fall extremely flat, either due to the game's inability to ever let a joke die peacefully, or hinging things on bad sex comedy that feels intensely regressive (panty theft, 'wacky' incest, false sexual assault accusations). The nadir is probably the Remix Heart story, which is an extension of the Blazblue manga of the same name which is 95% low-effort ecchi trash... and about 5% positive transgender bit, but it doesn't make up for the former.  That all being said, the game buries you in things to do and unlock, from a survival mode where you level up a character to murderous challenge modes to an extensive gallery mode. It'll take a long time to unlock everything legit, and most of it is cool... but I'm going to throw in a caveat. It's a small, almost inconsequential thing, but the gallery does contain some troublingly sexualized images of the underage characters. If you're in the anime and manga community, you know the drill, and it relates to what I was talking about at first. By trying to appeal to all sorts of people, they also appeal to some people that just aren't worth catering to. It's almost enough to make me give it a thumbs down on its own, and if you've read this far you can give it one yourself based on your willingness to tolerate this sort of baiting.  That being said, the fighting fundamentals are still amazing enough for me to give a recommend, with bright and colorful (if aging somewhat) sprites, and a lot of content for your money. While it relies on quantity over quality to an extent, it has enough unique gameplay notions and clever ideas to give it a recommend with the above caveats. While not as progressive as Guilty Gear Xrd, if you're looking for a solid 2D fighter with a fun cast that can essentially keep you busy for eternity, it's absolutely worth the asking price.",

The problem is the online experience, which is what most people expect to be decent if they're buying a fighting game. To be blunt, it's complete and utter garbage. It still uses outdated netcode, and there's, even at launch, a small population of players online. So finding matches that aren't extremely delayed is very, very hard.   On top of this, damn near everyone playing is extremely experienced at the series if not this specific game. If you're a new player, you have absolutely no chance at competing, and the game is full of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that taunt when they beat you and crash rooms specifically labled 'newbie' or 'noob' with whatever they main and proceed to just combo you up a wall constantly. Some of them sandbag, but never for long because once you start winning they always show you just how much of a smurfing ♥♥♥♥♥♥ they are.  The end result of this is that if you bought this game for the single player, it's... Well, it's decent. But if you bought it for the multiplayer as most people do, and you're not part of the small community of players who've been playing since the start... Well, it's going to be a very unpleasant time. You're going to find nothing but lag and people with hundreds if not thousands of hours of experience at the game.  If you want an Arcsys fighter, all I can say is look elsewhere towards Xrd, especially as most of the console players who came over to PC to stomp newbies have moved back to console. The game is also more forgiving with inputs and there's a larger average player community, so if you're new you're going to have an easier time.",

It fully supports xbox one wireless controller, however, the game isn't desinged to adapt to different controller (PS3, PS4 or Xbox one), it shows which button to use both in keyboard and controller (In The Wither 3, it shows message in favor of xbox controller if you use xbox controller).  Still, I recommend this game because of the following reasons (right now I only played a very short time, I will update this review whenever I think so) 1, The tutorial is very fun 2, There is a mode introduces the story of previous versions, and it's very fun.  Looking forward to the next installment!",
