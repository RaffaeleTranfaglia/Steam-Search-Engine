            "review_text": "This game is simple to understand and easy to fall in love with. Its a time management game so, even if your not playing it the game will still continue to run and continue with the game. But dont worry about that, in the menu you can pause time, make it go slower, or make it go faster. Its a bit hard to make money in the beginning but after a while it speeds up. The graphic's for the customers are a bit old school but that why I love the game. Its an old school time management game and in my opinion its was worth the money. The pictures make the game look more complicated then it really is. Also as a bonus feature in the game you can collect bugs that will appear randomly on your plants every now and then. So you can try and collect all the bugs as a little bonus feature to the game. This game won't take up much of your time and it's a bit addicting so be warned!",
