    "minimum_requirements": "OS: Windows 7 Processor: Somewhat modern Dual Core + Memory: 2 GB RAM Graphics: 512MB + Storage: 500 MB available space Additional Notes: If your specs aren't high enough to play this game, you should really consider saving your money and buying a new computer. A decision like that would greatly improve your life in many aspects rather than the couple hours enjoyment you may get from my game. Or whatever, it's your money ;)",
    "recommended_requirements": "OS: Windows 10 Processor: Octa Core+ (I am just assuming Octa means 8) Memory: 7 GB RAM Graphics: 2x GTX 1080 TI (unless you can have more, then by all means) Storage: 501 MB available space Sound Card: I often wonder if a sound card would make my garbage sounds any better. If I didn't get the sounds from a royalty free site, I just recorded weird sounds and then used a free program to slightly modify them so they sounded less like a dude making strange sounds. Additional Notes: Nobody exists on purpose. Nobody belongs anywhere. We're all going to die. Come play orbt xl.",
