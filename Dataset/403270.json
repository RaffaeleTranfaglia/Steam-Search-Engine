            "review_text": "Arguably the spirtual sucessor to Marble Madness in the arcades of old, this little gem of a game is pretty much perfect. It's hellishly addictive, lots and lots of fun and is even funny in places (spoiler = space worms!). I highly recommend this game! Especially if you ever played and liked Marble Madness.  Pros.    Its better than marble madness. (High praise!)   This is great value, and will give you hours of fun!   It works well on oculus rift too!   Play with the xbox controller.   It wont hurt your wallet unduly.   Every game is different, as it's procedurally generated.   Cons   I doesnt have native mouse support so you'll have to use a little work around to get your trackball to work with it. It can be done using an autohotkey script to emulate the keyboard controls. Who knows the dev may add mouse support in the future.   You may get addicted to this!   That's it!  ",
