            "review_text": "So far, I am in love with this game. I guess I'll do a pros and cons list for this one  PROS:  - graphics - sound effects - shooting is satisfying - lots of power ups that stack ( kinda like Risk of Rain, or more comparable to this, Dungeon Souls ) - replayability - all enemies are fair - it is SOMETIMES possible to play super aggressive which is always fun - plays more like an arcade game more than a roguelike, but I like it that way - level generation is 90% fair - Tryzna ( the developer ) has answered 2/3 of my questions, great developer!  CONS:  - the 10% of generation that ISN'T always fair: sometimes you spawn in and there's too many enemies to deal with at once ( minor complaint, but what can you expect from a random number generator ) - dodging isn't really possible outside of using cover, the character is too slow and the bullets are too fast  I give this game a SOLID 9/10 and look foward to spending lots of time with the game :)",
