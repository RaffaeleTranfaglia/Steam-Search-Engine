Either that or the famous Nostalgia Goggles.",

Sure, I may be a Star Wars fan myself but this doesn't affect my opinion on this fantasic game. To the people who say the graphics make up the game entirely, just do yourself a favour and don't play a single game for the rest of your life. Sure, the graphics in this game aren't up to scratch with today's standards but they sure were back in the good days of 2005. To be honest, I think they're great!   The gameplay and story line is simply amazing. It brings you back to Geonosis, Kashyyk, an abandoned Republic Cruiser and a few other places. I don't think there is another Commando game out there that is based on Star Wars. But if there is, this has got to be one of the best around. I spent heaps of time playing Star Wars Battlefront 1 &amp; 2 and let me tell you, those are amazing games too. The squad that you play with is also very responsive and helpful (unlike in many other games). They'll do what you tell them to do. No questions asked. Unless they are under heavy fire and it is protocol-wise required to defeat the enemy first (goddammit just revive me already haha). Scorch really does keep the squad alive with his 'jokes', athough he can say it the wrong times.  But too bad Lucas Arts and Pandemic have left the Star Wars games, they were doing a fantastic job. Anyway, overall this is a fantastic game and I hope it won't be forgotten. If you are looking for a multiplayer, try going to Star Wars Battlefront 2. That is also an amazing game. I'll give it 9.5/10. Buy it already if you haven't! Have fun! :)",

Great story, and they don't take much of your time. Intense gameplay, with quick desicion making action from full on attack and support, to revive you and turret cover.   BUY THIS GAME!

            "review_text": "'GET YOURSELF SOME BACTA, SOLDIER'  The prequels were flawed yes, but at least the Episodes II-III era (2002-2005) spawned some sweet SW games, for many the last great era for LucasArts (everything went downhill after 2005).  Republic Commando is 'THE' SW shooter, by that I mean the best SW shooter of all time (unless Dark Forces gets a remake, which is unlikely next to impossible).   The Halo 2-Half 2 influence is evident (minus riding a vehicle and the gravity gun) and the game tries to be lean and mean (not bloody though). Explosions and melee attacks are everywhere, and the cheesy-cute humor of the prequels is nowhere to be found. Overall the game provides a solid Clone Wars experience. The graphics still look very good for a mid-00s game and the sound design is superb.  But sadly, the game has some clear flaws, which put the game in a 8-8.5 out of 10 zone at best (it could have been a 10 out of 10)  a) too short (like 4-5 hours on easy). Also, some people will find frustrating that there are only three (extended) maps: Geonosis, Republic Ship and Kashyyyk.  b) the AI of the squad is not that great, they get killed easily on medium difficulty. c) some enemies are ridiculously overpowered and hard to kill without heavy weapons (which are hard to find)  That said, the game was loved-popular enough so fans demanded a sequel, which never came due to the mismanagement of LucasArts that slowly killed the company until its 2012 disappearance.",

            "review_text": "This is one of the most criminally-underrated shooters ever made. The game manages to fully immerse the player in the Star Wars universe without using Jedi, force powers, or any other hallmarks typical of the Star Wars franchise. This is a tactical first-person shooter played from the perspective of a Clone Trooper, one of the expendable 'mooks' who drop like flies in the movies and are predecessors to the Stormtroopers, the ultimate 'disposable bad guy.' Each member of the squad is a clone, but they behave with distinctive personalities and voices that make you actually care about them.   The game has a fairly good difficulty curve, with the game gradually spacing bacta tanks and ammo dumps farther and farther apart as the game progresses without becoming noticeable. You will need to use teamwork to knock out larger enemies like spider droids, which are almost impossible to down with the limited grenade launcher ammo you have. To drive the importance of team work home, the game has several sections where the squad splits, meaning you have no one to revive you if you die. And you have at most 6 hits on normal difficulty before you're a goner.   The presentation is fantastic. The graphics have aged well and it runs smoothly on modern operating systems with no compatibility issues. The soundtrack is a masterpiece, with memorable pieces like the Mandalorian chant 'Vode An' punctuating intense action sequences, as well as familiar snippets from the film scores. The game will throw in bits of fan-service such as a squad mate quipping 'these must be the droids we're looking for' which just make you chuckle even under pressure.   The AI is decent but will occasionally get stuck behind barriers when rushing to revive you, leading to frustration. The cooperative nature of the campaign makes the lack of online co-op campaign play very glaring. If this game ever gets a sequel, this feature needs to be added first. The campaign only features three planets, and is pretty short. None of the multiplayer maps are very interesting. These are probably due to the game's status as a tie-in for Episode III's film release with crunched development time.   Just get this game. You will not be disappointed. It's not perfect by any means but its extremely minor flaws do little to hamper an amazing experience. For a 9-year-old game it's extremely playable and not dated at all.",

Let's start with gameplay. In all reality despite the fantastic feeling of commanding your squad it's fairly average. I went, I shot, I won. Simple as that. So you will really be playing this game for it's story, along with the atmosphere and characters. It all works exactly when it wants to work, and your team actually sounds like real people, not hastily done voice-acting as seen in some games (a personal favorite line of mine is from Sev, 'Boss, hold on to your guts while I rip out theirs'). The story spans about 9 hours (for me at least) and it is very well written, especially since it goes off of only three levels. Yes, you will get that many hours out of three stinkin' levels! Unfortunately it is poorly ended, and while I won't spoil anything it felt like they tried to cram a lot of what could have been another half hour to an hour of story into four minutes, and while it does wrap everything up, it just doesn't work that well. On to atmosphere. The only level where it was really polished was the second, on a ship attacked by Trandoshan mercenaries. It reeks of 'creepy' and and really helps the build up of what is going on. Now then, time to talk enemies. Anything and everthing will kill you, except regular Battle Droids and Geonision babies. Yes, babies. Super Battle Droids will become the bane of your exisitance and everything you thought you knew about about them goes down the drain (Sorry Battlefront II players, you're done for). Something interesting is how different grenades I had know use for before became quite important to me once I learned what they good against, and I began cursing myself for using them on a Spider Droid and what-not. Overall, this game gave me a very enjoyable experience, and maybe someday I will get around to playing it again.  My score: 7/10  For as much as I praise this game, the levels did feel a bit drawn out at times, as well as the enemy health bars. But on the other hand, I did kill five geonision babies by electrocuting them into little bits. So thats a plus.",

There's your standardized pistol (infinite ammo, energy recharge), the standardized rifle (with sniping and explosives attachments), and then you can have a single enemy weapon. That could be anything an enemy drops, like a geonosian beam rifle (pretty much shoots a powerful beam of energy) or a trandoshan shotgun, or even a wookie bowcaster. There's also heavy weapons you can get, like the ACP Heavy Repeater or the Wookie Rocket Launcher. Personally, by the end of the game I really only used the pistol, and the rifle attachments if I really need to.  It also has a fair ammount of extra fun one time kind of stuff. Most of them come as a surprise, so I don't really wanna spoil it for you.  When you play, keep in mind how useful cover can really be. You have an energy shield, which recharges, and a pistol with infinite ammo. If you can find some good cover, you can use those two together and take out just about anything with relative ease.",

With you there are three other commandos that you give orders in field during each mission,such as slicing door,planting detonators etc.   The graphics are nothing to boost about,they are what 2005 games looked like in the day,but the music is great seeing as it triggers only in the right moments. The gameplay is pretty satisfaying and it really makes this game the best FPS i ever played.    The only thing i didn't like about this game is how it has a range of 8-10 hours of campaign,which is pretty short. Even more if you consider that the game ends abruptly AND with a cliffhanger,with a sequel that may never be made.",

Which we need more games like this, instead of these one man superpowered (yet normal) soldiers that can regenerate wounds after getting shot multiple times, and with unintelligent A.I. (that seem like that they're just for show, like a hindrance, rather than helping the player take care of hostiles) that stays back 10 feet behind while the player is on the other side of the map, blasting their way through enemy territory.   We need less games like that, and more of this, if the FPS Genre wants to at least survive in someway. Definitely worth buying, that is, if you like to work as a team. If you can't handle that responsibility, then look somewhere else.  Oh and this game actually has a challenge to it. Pretty rare nowadays in the FPS Genre.  9.7/10 Would buy and play again.",

Your excellently written and acted squad is comprised of Fixer, the hacker and technical expert, Sev who is the hunter and sniper of the group who jokes around with Scorch, the demolitions expert who is always telling jokes at the worst of times. You and your squad fight on iconic planets from the movies such as Geonosis and Kashyyyk doing missons such as killing geonosian leaders, blowing up droid factories and saving wookie generals. The game is a first person shooter (obviously) with some strategy elements involved via squad commands such as ordering your troops to move to tactical positions, provide covering fire, attack targeted enemies and seize objectives. Certain actions will play to a commando's strengths like Sev is the best with a sniper and Scorch arms explosives faster and Fixer hacks quicker. This game looks good even though it came out about a decade ago and has really nice level design. The campaign is short lasting about 5-7 hours but it makes you eager for more and the story set up a sequel which we unfortunately never got but i hope that one day we will.

I will however state that I absolutely love this game. Don't let the few hours clocked on Steam fool you. I only bought it on Steam because it's more convenient than using 2 very worn CDs. I've played the campaign at least a dozen times over the years. Sadly, the campaign is short, but in no way does the campaign length negatively impact the absolute quality of this game. Best squad-shooter I've ever played. Excellent voice acting. Squadmate lines are witty and charming, and the squad is extremely affable. There is no way you will not like all of them, though it is very likely that you'll have a favourite. Mine is Scorch :) And you will experience true loneliness when you and your squad split up on several occasions to achieve independent objectives.  Again, I love this game above all others and I would recommend this game to anyone, anyday and everyday, Star Wars fan or otherwise.  If you value exellent gameplay, simple yet elegant squad mechanics, amazing voice acting, witty one-liners, affable teammates, dark and immersive atmosphere, brilliant music and everything else that makes an excellent game excellent, you would be severely amiss to let this game go unplayed. And when you're done with it, play it again. And again. One play through hardly does the game justice as it impossible to get take notice of all the gems it offers with just one play through.

            "review_text": "One of the best Star Wars games I've ever played! Every aspect of this game feels really polished, creative, and researched (well, as much as you can for a sci-fi setting). It all comes together with the gameplay to make a really immersive and surprisingly original (since it's not just re-hashing something straight out of the movies) experience.  First of all, the gameplay. After my first session of this game, I actually had a lot of complaints. The enemies feel like bullet sponges - often times taking entire clips just to down one. My squadmates stand out in the open in view of a strong enemy and stupidly march to their deaths without taking cover into consideration. The reticle for the main rifle is really wide and it doesn't feel 'precise' like I would imagine a laser weapon would feel. Even when I have an enemy in the crosshairs a lot of shots go wide. However, after my second session these complaints disappeared as I got familiarity with the gameplay. You learn the importance of grenades for taking out the high-health enemies, the importance of ordering your troops around to specific 'maneuvers', how to hit targets with all the different weapons, and how it doesn't matter that much if your squad does dumb stuff because you can still win encounters on your own. You start to understand the tactical tradeoffs of the different maneuvers and weapons. So, if you find yourself frustrated or a bit annoyed your first time playing, give it a rest for the day and come back tomorrow.  You might notice the squad-based tactics and orders system. If you've played other games like that, you might be dreading having to deal with it, but I think that it's done very well in this game. It's really simple, and they do a great job of helping you keep track of what your squad is doing. There's a lot of subtle ways they achieve this and I won't describe them all. You won't really have to micro manage what everybody is doing using all sorts of different keys - you usually just press F2 so they follow you around, and then point at things in the environment and press 'f' to tell a squad mate to perform a specific maneuver. Because it's implemented this way, it's pretty seamless as you switch between shooting and commanding your squad. Even if you go down, your squad can sometimes manage on their own and come revive you.  Anyway, it's hard to be frustrated with this game because of the great quick save and quick load system. It's really fast and makes it so you never have to worry about replaying a section over and over. If you do find yourself at a spot where you keep failing, there's usually a 'trick' to the encounter to overcome that spot, accomplished by intelligently using the weapons and maneuvers available to you. It's a nice way to design a game like this - a lot of the encounters are kind of like puzzles, in a way.  And all that is just about the gameplay. One of the best things about this game is the detail and the immersion it achieves. I highly recommend going into the sound settings and making sure you max them out if you can, and making sure to play with headphones with the volume high enough. There's all sorts of details in all the little sounds, the writing, the UI elements, the dialogue and one-off things the characters say that manages to not get too repetitive, and lots more that needs to be experienced to be understood.  If you like Star Wars games, this is one of the best. Even without that, the game is a fun, squad-based sci-fi shooter. It's actually similar to Halo in a lot of ways, so if you like that game I bet you'd enjoy this.",

            "review_text": "Star Wars Republic Commando (or as I like to call it also, Band of Clone Bros) is the forgotten and underrated Star Wars video game that everybody that loves the Star Wars franchise should play. The story of the game is based on the 2nd and 3rd movies of the prequel trilogy, where you play as the leader of a Spec Ops squad of 4 Clones of the Galactic Republic who are responsible for performing special missions that occure behind the scenes of the Clone Wars. This is a squad based game, where using your squad team seriously will be your road for victory. The fact that you play as a Clone, fighting along aside with a team of other Clones, breaks the monotony of the usual protagonists of a story of a Star Wars game, which tend to be Jedis, Siths or some random bounty hunter.  I agree, like the vast majority of people who played it, that this is a good game - but not a perfect one. It has one problem that I felt frustrated about: while the enemy was agressive against you, your squad team will be very weak and will lack agressivness, unless you babysit them all the time. Sometimes, they will just get close to an enemy and try killing them by melee (it reminds me of the Warscape Engine BS that is now plaguing the Total War series...), instead of trying to get to cover by their own initiative. Another problem that I have with the game is the lack of variety with the level designs: the game is divided only by 3 chapters, which are limited equally to 3 areas (first you fight in one planet, then inside a ship, and then again in another planet). A little bit of more effort from the producers of this videogame could have created more variety for you to be present in another scenarios/planets of the Clone Wars. But I believe this problem to be minor, when you compare to the much more positive aspects of the game.  Still, I cannot recommend you buy it at full price (except if your are a Star Wars nerd :P), since it is an old game and it no longer has an active multiplayermode. Buy it only when it´s in promotion.  Like many people claim, this game really needs a sequel - where you play as the same squad team, now part of the forces of the eeeeeeeevil Galactic Empire. It would have been a much better sequel to make instead of the disaster that was Star Wars 'BattleFront' EA (THE GAME IS NOT WORTH OF DESERVING OF 'BATTELFRONT' ON IT´S TITLE!!!). Unfortunatelly, this game appears to have been forgotten and I don´t think a sequel (or a reboot) will ever be created.  7.5 out of 10 ",

Despite having to jump through numerous hoops in order to get it optimised for a modern operating system, Republic Commando is a surprisingly wonderful game given that it is, in many ways, a rather standard corridor shooter.  Whilst genre-wise it may play as a rather standard FPS shooter, the writing of the characters and the missions gives a much greater depth to the world than it otherwise ought to have. You play the commander of a crack team of Republic commandos, and your teammates all have distinct and consistent personalities, and are autonomous enough to make them seem genuinely intelligent. Yes, you will be giving orders for the most part - and their AI is programmed well enough so as to feel like they're an extension of yourself, as they should - but you won't need to tell them to heal themselves, or attack the bad guys if a threat looms, and should you be overcome and you need help, they will be promptly at your side healing you at the risk of their own lives. And this all helps to develop a genuine bond with your fellow squadmates, particularly as the game is much easier when you have their help, further emphasising the importance of your cumulative strength as a team.   On top of this, the missions, whilst comprising of many parts, manage to consistently escalate the stakes until by the end of the mission you feel a genuine and frantic rush of adrenaline as you plunge headlong into the final stages of each operation. And it's the little things that make a difference - for example, whereas most games would have an alert announcement indicating that your vessel will self-destruct, in this case they're serious. And it's these little things that actually make you emote as a player, which is what any experience should do, whether it's a book or a movie or a video game.   And thus, Republic Commando manages to rise above it's state and hold up quite well as a challenging and compelling experience.   I'd recommend it to Star Wars fans primarily, although I think it has a wider appeal because of the quality of the writing.",

I'm a fan of the novels, and this just brings the characters you meet there, namely Delta Squad, to life. 11/10 for sure.

Fortunately for Republic Commando, I love Halo. Plus, RC tends to add some nifty features to the mix, such as the tactical aspect of commanding your squad (although the main tactic seems to be 'tell squad to snipe, step away from keyboard'). It also does a pretty good job of giving the characters personalities. They seem real, as opposed to just monotonous drones like Halo marines.

It's based on setting up bombs, waiting, then blowing it up. Rinse and repeat. Gunplay you unload 1k bullets on the thing and it finally blows up. Most of the time I just stood in place shooting at stuff. It feels like the hit detection is off and hit chance on you is a system of RNG. The story is sorta neat but it follows a story that really is made for 8yr old kids and is really not crucial because it's based on behind the scenes of Lucas Clone Wars. The music is from the film which is good but repeats over and over. The ending looks like Lucas told them to release it now and they had no choice by meeting the deadline or maybe they wanted to be edgy and made a huge cliffhanger.

            "review_text": "I recommend this game only for people who want to play a STAR WARS game that doesn't have Jedi in it. If you like military shooters or STAR WARS games, this game is mediocre at being both.  STAR WARS Republic Commando takes place in the events that happen before episode 2 and episode 3 of the prequel trilogy. You are Delta 38 (voiced by Temuera Morrison himself) is the squad leader of Delta Squad; a clone commando unit. Your squad is sent on covert and high risk missions against the separatist forces. The rest of your squad (not voiced by Temuera Morrison) follow your orders as you tactically move through the missions to with the day.  The biggest problem I have with this game are the weapons. Your main weapon, the blaster rifle, in particular is frustrating for how weak and inaccurate it is. It looks like a toy, and kicks like a mouse. Looking down the iron sights of this weapon doesn't do much for your accuracy and it takes up practically the whole screen while slowing you down to a walking pace. Your other weapons are a sniper rifle and a grenade launcher, but their ammo is scarce. This effectively forces you to use said blaster rifle most of the time. Although the game has special weapons you can pick up and use, many don't have the punch to really make a difference.  The second aspect to this game is your squad. Your squad mates can be ordered to take up sniping positions; demolish targets; attack targets you mark etc. The squad are pretty interesting in their own right as they all have personalities that show in their dialogue and appearance. For AI characters, they stand out for being competent and effective. There were times I was hacking, or attaching a demolition charge and not receiving a scratch from the enemy. Not much else can be said about them really, except they have personalities and are competent squad mates. In 2005 (and today at times), that was impressive.  The tactical aspect of this game is where this game fails. Its as deep as a kiddie pool, and not very complex. If you played games like Ghost recon or Rainbow Six; don't expect the same to challenge you. To have your squad snipe, use their grenade launcher, or even throw grenades you have to assign one of them to a designated spot and simply push a button. Maneuvers are assigned squad wide with no option to order a single soldier to defend a position or follow you. With this lack of flexibility to order your squad around, can make any veteran of tactical shooters disappointed and frustrated. In conclusion, this is one of those games that just hasn't aged well. It was impressive for its time, but there isn't anything enduring that can make it last as a classic. Aside from being a STAR WARS game without the iconic Jedi, there is nothing this game does that hasn't done better before or since in other games.",

Your characters never improve and you never find better gear other than what you start with after the tutorial mission. You can pick up one temporary drop from enemies, but there are only af ew types of weapons you can use, and only until your ammo runs out.  You end up doing the same thing most every scenerio, only the scenery is different. Combat is very wonkly. You can be at full shields and health and instantly die. You can also be standing infront of a squad of enemies who never seem to hit you. It is very inconsistent.   Your AI squad loves to run off and die unless you keep tight control over them. This is suppoed to be a squad of 'elite commandos', mind you.  The developers had very few tricks in thier bag, and all they do is the same tricks over and over with increasing intensity.

In every mission there is going to be a new battleground and new things to take into account. Maybe they have turrets, maybe we have turrets, maybe we have different sniping positions (did I mention you can tell your teammates where to snipe from?), maybe they have a spider droid, what weapons/ammo do we have? Maybe one of my team mates isn't with me right now. All of it comes down to a very fun and stratiegic game. This game really is the defenition of an awesome FPS. The one complaint I have is the storyline is a bit short, but 12 hours campaign for first time play through isn't that bad. 10/10. I would recommend it to any Star Wars or FPS lover.

Commandos is somewhat linear which i dont mind because it fits the game well. plus the game itself is short. i actually recomend to play the whole game in one shot though. the game plays well and is fun i recomend picking it up. i also recomend reading all five of the books as it adds to the commando universe expanding it since the games sequel was canceled because of lucas arts sucking the nuts of a monkey.

The storyline is good, and wide the gap between episode 2 and 3 in prequels (if you hate prequels, give these game a chance to play, this game truly best)  Pros:      Very good storyline.     Well defined A.I mechanism, with different characters perform different tasks, in fact I think its better than modern game such as COD and Battlefield. You can assign characters to perform tasks which I truly miss in new modern day game.     Very good plot. If you interested in Expanded Universe which Disney just destroy, this game truly for you. With backstory on its novel, these commandos have interesting backstory to follow in EU. Read the novel to fully understand the EU around clones and its story    Cons:      Campaign too short. You can practically finish this game in a day.     No multiplayer. Im truly sad this game does not support multiplayer anymore. You can find dedicated server to play with I think.

It's great for Star Wars fans especially those whom love the Clone Wars. It's extremely fun to actually be commanding a squad rather than being the 'newest recruit' in the squad. You're all brought up the same way and you all became part of a team together which really puts the equality between your team. The great thing about this is rather than viewing them by their rank, despite that they're all pretty much the same in this game anyway, you can view them by what they're specialized in.  Another great thing about this game is that your character can actually talk! YES! You read this correctly! Unlike almost EVERY other FPS, your character can talk! And he talks as much as the rest of the squad which can lead to some really interesting conversations between the squad.  However, as with every other game, there are some flaws. This game can be INCREDIBLY difficult which really puts people like me off of playing it. Because who wants to play the same mission 100 times just to move to the next, even harder, section of the mission. If you're someone who hates having to search up walkthroughs, good luck trying to complete this without going to YouTube. Another flaw that links in with this, normally games use hints for you to find out how to get around a certain enemy in this game. As much as I've focused on the surroundings, enemies AND dialogue, I haven't noticed any hints since Geonosis.  To sum up, for someone who hates a lot of FPS games I really enjoy this and I will continue to play it... When I can be bothered to look up the walkthrough for the mission on the Acclamator-class Assualt ship.  I rate this game: 7/10",

A lot of the negative reviewers cite bad gunplay, lackluster squad system, and repeteteive/linear gamplay. All somewhat true, save the first one. Yes you do the same thing quite a few times (Planting charges or hacking doors) but you can just tell your squad to do it, and it 20 seconds time, it's done. I rather enjoyed the story, the gameplay, and the experience. I suffered no issues with bugs or crashes and I could run the game at 1080p &gt;100 FPS no problem.   I would definately reccomend this game if you are a fan of Star Wars, especially the Clone side of the series. ",

As the leader you control your squad but not in a RTS format, and as such you tell them to do things such as go to a sniper spot target a enemy and so on.So it Rainbow six in the star wars universe and my god is it done well.Let me warn you though this game is not nice it is pretty hard even on normal [NOTE:for anyone who beat this game on hard I tip my hat to you].Also this game is very intense I was shaking at the end of some mission but not in a horror way. but there are flaws like it feels like some enemies take way to many bullets and since your gun only has 300 bullets in it you will run out fast also some enemies seem just a little OP but that may just mean i'm bad.Also game is set in the clone war saga and the story at least for the clone wars is pretty good and there is a sad part that I won't spoil.So with that in mind I give this game a 8/10",

Jesse Harlin and John William's music scores help intensify the gameplay and I garentee that you will find something about this game you will like. Its a great star wars game that lets you see through the eyes of a soldier and does an excellent job at that. It also stays relevant becuase the characters in this game had a cameo in the clone wars 3D animation show, so it also stays with in canon of the updated star wars EU. There is multiplayer, however its not as fluid as the campaign. The game to be fair is not that long and does not have offical controller support (recommend getting xpadder for that).

Gameplay: Star Wars: Republic Commando is a game that I had been meaning to play for quite a while now; ever since about 2007, in fact. I just never got around to buying it, though. Once I saw it go on sale through Steam, I figured now would be the time to get my hands on it. Did it live up to my expectations? Eh... kinda sorta. This game is pretty much a run of the mill squad-based tactical shooter with a little bit of actual tactics here and there. You do have to do some ordering of your own, as your squadmates are a little bit... dumb. I'm talking crouching right in front of a Super Battle Droid dumb (and man oh man do they love doing that). Now, when you die you do have a chance to be revived by your teammates, provided they don't end up doing what I mentioned in the previous sentence. Likewise, you can revive your teammates that have fallen, and they most definitely will fall throughout this game. Quite a lot.  Regarding the difficulty curve, there is one. It's too bad that this curve is a sine curve, though. In fact, the hardest enemy in the game is met in the first hour or so of gameplay; the Geonosian Elite. This guy will ruin your day, especially when they show up en masse later on. Why, you may ask? 'cuz he's got a death laser for an arm, which coupled with the sometimes turkey-in-the-rain level of intelligence of your AI, can often mean that your entire squad gets taken out by one enemy. I'd say that about 30% of my deaths in this game were due to Geonosian Elites, another 40% due to squadmate incompetence, and the last 30% due to my own incompetence. That does seem like quite the number for deaths on my hand, but hey, I never claimed to be a tactician.  As for the other enemies in the game, it's pretty standard fare. You've got Geonosians, Trandoshians, Droids, and that's for the most part your lot. Weapon variety isn't the greatest, but it's functional enough. You've got a pistol, assault rifle, sniper rifle, a grenade launcher, and one variety of 'other weapon,' which can be a shotgun, SMG, another rocket launcher, etc. Ammo can be pretty darn scarce, so if you have the opportunity to faceplant into enemies and end them with your Knife of +9 Life Ending, that's a good idea. Yes, circle strafing around an SBD is a valid strategy. Yes, I've used it quite a bit. Yes, it's gotten me killed quite a bit as well. But hey, the knife is a very viable weapon, so I like to use it. There are, disappointingly, no boss fights in the game. I guess this is around the time when game designers thought bosses were SOOOO 90's or something i dunno.  Overall, though, I had a pretty good time with this game. It sure as hell ain't worth the 8.7 Gamespot gave it, considering Shadow Hearts: Covenant got an 8.7 and is one of my favorite RPGs of all time, but it's a pretty nice game nonetheless. I could see this being loads of fun with friends (especially since your friends will almost undoubtedly be smarter than the AI), but even with the singleplayer experience, I had a good enough time. 7/10.  Story: The actual story is pretty lackluster, I must admit. I'm not too huge of a Star Wars nerd, so there may be some parts of the Star Wars canon that this game apparently fills, but from what I could tell, it was either a fanservice-y plot or just a plot about four dudes going into places and shooting things. The game does try to add a bit of personality with squad banter, but it ends up being more groanworthy than anything else. Good effort, though. It also tries to be dramatic at the end, but I didn't find myself really caring all that much about what happened. 6/10.  Graphics: It's always tough talking about games from the past as far as their graphical capabilities go. Considering that this game came out in the early parts of 2005, I've gotta say; this game doesn't look half bad. Certainly pretty good for the time. Also, some of the visual effects such as when you go into low light mode look really cool. Some of the textures can be pretty ugly at times, but overall I'd say that the game is holding up, even if it's just barely doing so. It's not 90's shooter ugly yet, so there's that. As for the graphical capabilities of this game, they're honestly kinda disappointing. The game defaults to 4:3 resolutions, but since the game runs on the Unreal Engine, you can do a simple .ini tweak to make it run in fullscreen wide resolutions. I never did that, since I thought the game may not look the greatest, but after looking a bit on PCGamingWiki (a fantastic site), you can apparently change things like FOV to make the game look like it should. I didn't care enough to do that, so I just opted to run the game windowed at 1280x960. The game ran well, as one would expect, not really needing much of any resources from me. Overall, the game does look pretty nice, even though the game only runs at 4:3 resolutions without .ini tweaks. 3/5.  Sound: Well, they sure weren't subtle with the soundtrack. In fact, it gets kinda silly with how bombastic it gets at times. Apparently a lot of it is reused John Williams work, which is rather disappointing, I must say. I'd expect LucasArts to actually do a complete original score for this game. As for the voice acting... well, it's not bad. Nothing that'll knock your socks off, but it works well enough. Honestly, the game is kinda disappointing on the audio front. It either feels like a copy and paste effort or just a 'not bad' effort. 2/5.  Overall scores are: 7/6/3/2; cumulative score of 6.0/10. Pretty much an above average game that doesn't reach too far beyond that mark.",

The fast-paced FPS action surpasses other FPSs such as TF2 and COD. Unfortunatley, not a lot of people play this game. There are only about 12 multiplayer servers and only 4 of them ever have a decent ammount of people on at one time.   Overall, I belive this game is highly underrated and deserves MANY more players. At 10 bucks, this game is COMPLETELY worth it. I don't say this about a lot of games, but I give Star Wars Republic Commandos a 10/10!!!!! You would be an absolute FOOL not to buy this game.",

This more personable style comes across in the characters as well with any one member of Delta squad having more personality in their pinky finger than Padme Amidala has in her entire body.   On the gameplay side of things, Republic Commando almost feels like a Rainbow Six/early Halo lovechild. The player, in the role of Boss, has near total control over their squadmates, which can lead to some excellently rewarding shootouts against Separatist forces. For all it focus on tactics though, Republic Commando adopts the semi-bullet sponge enemies of Halo and similar series, which can be frustrating at times, though it doesn't significantly harm the experience.   Republic Commando is a game that does many things right and very few things even partially wrong, and it's a must play for Star Wars fans and shooter fans alike.",

Recommended on sale/in a bundle or if you live and breathe Star Wars. Otherwise, be prepared for a lot of frustration for what I think is a mediocre shooter.  Pros +Explores the Star Wars universe from a non-Jedi perspective, something that is too rare anymore. How the clone troopers weapons and suits work is fun. Having your visor wipe bug goo off never gets old. +Environments are very attractive, even if the graphics don’t hold up very well. +More Star Wars is always good.  Cons -Computer team mates. Their AI is horrible and having them do every single task is a pain that takes way too much time. Even though they are supposed to have specialties I occasionally see whoever is closest doing the job. If your elite Delta squad teammates can’t hit ♥♥♥♥ it’s no wonder the average storm trooper never managed to land a hit within a parsec of Luke &amp; Co. -All of the weapons I tried If you are in any way used to the modern iron-sights shooters or anything that has a small reticule so you can actually hit what you are aiming at and don’t want to deal with a metric ♥♥♥♥-ton of frustration, steer clear of this game.  -Enemies seem to have variable difficulty.

Some of my fondest memories were me trying to beat the Geonosis section for the first time, and dying over and over again because of those elite Geonotians picking me and my squadmates off one by one. Now, looking at this game through older eyes, and playing it all the way through, I can tell you that it is one of the best $10 I've ever spent. In case you haven't heard of this game before, it takes place in the events of Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith. You are part of Delta Squad, an elite group of four clones that are given tasks normally to covert or dangerous for normal clone troopers. You'll have to use your diverse arsenal, as well as team tactics to complete the tasks that are given to you.  PROS: -Very nice visuals, that still hold up well after eleven years -Solid voice acting all around, really fleshed out and loveable characters -Excellent story, probably the best story of any of the prequel movies/games -Combat is polished and exhilarating to play. Plenty of versatile tactical options -Runs well on pretty much any competent PC; mine ran it at the highest settings at 60fps throughout -Amazing soundtrack that combines John Williams' classic score with new and incredible music by Jesse Harlin  CONS: -Some optimization issues for new hardware. In menus, the mouse sensitivity is waaaay too high to use, so you'll have to use arrow keys to navigate menus. Larger resolutions aren't present, so if you have a big screen, the game may look a little pixelated. -I had one game-breaking bug. Delta 62 wouldn't move out of a corner, so I had to load my last save. That fixed the problem, but still annoying. -Very abrupt ending in my opinion -Game is kinda short (about 10 hours), but considering you're only paying $10 for it, I guess it's fine -May be harder for new players. Even I, admittedly, had to swith the difficulty to Easy for a couple of nightmarishly hard sections -No sequel. );  FINAL STATEMENT: This game is by far the best singleplayer Star Wars game ever made. It's best quality is just how polished everything is, from it's grim and somber take on the Clone Wars, to the magnificent, tough-as-nails tactical combat. The beautiful soundtrack, the fantastic voice work, and the great graphics help suck you into the game even more. And by the end of it, you'll want more (even though EA and Disney will never give us any more). Sure, the passage of eleven years has given it a couple technical hiccups, but they pale in comparison to the rest of the game.   RATING: 9/10",

It sounds great, and that is before you realise the lyrics for the soundtrack songs are in Mando'a, the language of the Mandalorians. My only complaint with this game is the rather short campaign, but everything else is amazing. I definitely recommend this game. 9/10     RIP Sev, that is if he is actually dead, not that we'll ever know (thanks Disney)   ",

Everyone is saying 'Oh this game just closes after clicking new game' but the reason this is happening is because everyone is setting every setting to the highest amount but the game cant handle that so you must KEEP BUMP MAPPING AT LOW. I had this exact problem too and I looked it up and it was solved just like that *snap.

I for one am not that good at games though, so I'm sure thoughs with experience in first person shooters shouldn't have to much of a problem. Also unlike Call of Duty where everybody tells you what to do, your the high rank who has to tell them what to do. It may seem a bit difficult to direct your allies and make them do what they should do, but it's not really that hard once you've gotten used to it. Plus, it gives off a sense of power. It's a good feeling, and overall, I think it's a good game. You should definitely try it out.",

I played this game all the time when it came out on Xbox and was very excited when I saw it here on Steam. Definitely a great purchase for any anyone who enjoys Star Wars and FPS games. Unlike many other FPS games, your AI squad is actually very intelliegent and one of the best things about this game. The only downfall is that once the game is over, the story is incomplete. There is a cliffhanger that sets up a sequal, but sadly that sequal never came. Maybe one day it will, but until then this game is definitely worth getting.  10/10",

            "review_text": "Star Wars. We all know it, we all love it. A franchise that not only shaped many a childhood, but had a lasting impact on the culture of America as a whole. Many games have come out set in the Star Wars universe, but Republic Commando is special. It doesn't have the mass marketing of Battlefront or the force-fueld power fantasy of the Force Unleashed. Yet to a small and very dedicated group of fans, this game holds a special place in our hearts.  The game sees you taking on the role of a Clone Commando. You are part of an elite unit within the Grand Army of the Republic. While the rest of the army is a mighty sword that strikes at the republic's word, you and your small squad are a precise scalple. You handle missions that any other soldier couldn't, from assainations to VIP rescue, and always from deep within enemy held territory.  Your squadmates fight with you, assiting you with various tasks and watching your back while you strike down the enemies of the Galactic Republic. Your skills as a soldier and a squad commander can mean the difference between success and failure. When the stakes are the galaxy it's self, failure is not an option.  While unfortunarely fairly short, it makes up for it with excellent game play. The controls are tight, everything flows smoothly, and you'll have to use some tactics to get past harder areas of the game. Do you order your team to set up explosives on an important objective, or focus on clearing the area first? Do you focus fire on the more powerful enemies, or try to pick off their much more numerous support? How are you going to cross this bridge with a strong enemy presence waiting just on the other side? All decisions you'll have to make.  With no known plans for a sequal, the story of Republic Commando may never be finished. What was given to us though is a solid, well made game about one of the biggest conficts in the history of a universe we love. I can not recomend it highly enough. It is certainly worth your time and your money.",

Story wasn't very interesting to me, but back then people might have enjoyed this game for its novelty in story and gameplay.  Squad system is good and micromanaging your squad makes you feel relevant and makes the game more interactive. The focus on squad based gameplay is well done, as it is antithetical to modern fps games like COD and Battlefield where you can go running and gunning and progress. This game forces you to work with your squad to take strong down enemies.   Overall decent but I probably won't be playing it again.",

When I found it on steam I was excited to go back to my childhood. This game runs on almost every PC (I got 1000+ frames). This game is very fun, and leaves you sad after completing the campaign since there is nothing else to play. I just did some research and there may be a sequel now.

If you ever watched the clone wars cartoon and saw the massive battles going on between droids and clones it felt like that, or like a much tighter version of the big battles in Battlefront 2.   On the whole the action is consistently good, and the levels feel fleshed out and complete. Gameplay in combat generally was good with decent flow between long and short range combat. Like in the first levels it says one of your squadmates (I think it was 07) prefers vibroblades, and I was wondering who would bring a knife to a gun fight. I soon discovered that it is often much more fun to shank a b*tch and wipe droid fluid off the visor.  One of the best things about this game is that it was one of the few games that got AI alies right. There was a fair amount of failures at times, but the way of calling out orders and targets feels so right.  One of the main critiques that I have is there were some moments that were an absolute slog. Like one time my squad got wiped right after a quicksave, and I felt myself in an edge of tomorow style death loop, but those moments were reletively distant.  It is one of the best shooters I have played in recent memory, and that is saying a lot about a game that came out 11 years ago.",

            "review_text": "In this cool fps starwars game you take on the role as commander 69, an elite clonecommander who is in charge for an eliteband of 3 clones called 'Delta Squad'. The characters in this squad is the following: Sev, Scorch and Fixer. Sev has a boring, cringy and killfiesta persona, he usually talks about how many kills he has and how he loves killing droids. Scorch is like Michelangelo from TMNT. He says stuff like 'radical', 'awesome' and 'superduper'. He has a knack for explosions. Other than his persona resembling a ♥♥♥♥ing 12 year old hes pretty ok. Fixer is the 'serious' guy in the group. He likes computers and hacking. Also hes really ♥♥♥♥ing boring and doesnt say to much. Your character is the only cool one.   So the graphics arent that good but in this game ♥♥♥♥ like that doesnt matter. The music is acceptable, it has borrowed all its 3 songs from the Star Wars movies and they put them on repeat. There is one song that is a complete ripoff of the Halo Theme song. The sounds is pretty good. The droids sounds the same as in the movies, the blasters sounds the same, i liked it.   (SPOILERS)  Now to get into the core part of this review. The game is divided into 3 parts: Genosis, a starship and Kashyyyk. Why they decided to split the game into 3 parts i dont understand because these parts starts off pretty cool towards the end they get so ♥♥♥♥ing repetetive and boring. It all boils down to: Go here, command your squad to shoot at super droids, then heal up. That ♥♥♥♥ stinks and i got really tired of the game halfway through. The weapons are pretty ok, you have like the standard as in all fps, nothing to brag about. Theres no side missions or some generic collectibles so you only stick to the main mission and it linear as ♥♥♥♥. Theres only one difficulty and that i guess medium becuase the game can be stupidly easy sometimes. So if youre and alpha guy like me who only plays games on hard mode this will stink. There is no character progression whatsoever in this game, even tho you fight together for like 12 000 years.   Now the good thing about the game is the 'command squad' functions. Being the commander you can command your squad to do different actions such as breach doors rainbow six style, hack doors, blow upp walls and other cool things. Also you can change between 4 modes for them to use. Form up, search and destroy, hold this objective and lets go. Its not much but it handles very well. Remember what i said in the beginning of the review about all the characters, you will have some pep talk and some ♥♥♥♥♥alk and it reminds me of Battlefield Bad Company. Its sometimes ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and cringey but it can be pretty nice sometimes becuase you feel like an actual squad. The first part of the game starts of reaaaaally ♥♥♥♥ing cool, you land in the arena at Genosis where Obi Wan and Anakin are captured and you storm this Genosian Citadel with other clones. Now this cool part ends pretty quick and you become this 4 man killingmachine, you mow down ♥♥♥♥ing millions of droids, genosians and trendors or whatever. This is not a good thing. If you are an elite band of clone troopers why do you send them in like a small army against millions of droid, that ♥♥♥♥ sucks. I wanna do rainbow six things like breaching a bunker whilst theres a war in the background, you know being behind enemy lines.   Summarizing the game: Pros: Good core mechanic Good and fun chemistry in the squad Cool environment and good 'Story' (?) The sound were good  Cons: The 3 parts of the game drags on for too long basic weapons only one difficulty only 4 music themes no character progression no collectibles or any other sidemissions   Yea im gonna recommend this game because i am a huge star wars ♥♥♥♥♥♥",
