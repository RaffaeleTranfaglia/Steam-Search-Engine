            "review_text": "A diamond in the rough would be a very accurate saying here. BLACKHOLE is both very rough in places and an excellent, charming, challenging and all around worthwhile platformer and experience. The movement in this game takes a while to master and is very satisfying to start pulling off. While some of the gimmicks are very physics reliant and overly difficult to manage, they are in the minority and the vast majority of levels are a blast to figure out. Luckily the game doesn´t require perfection, and the more aggrevating parts are easily skimmed through. The main mechanic of changing gravity is well used and the levels are often ingeniously designed with it.  The story and characters really create a complete experience that is more than just a pile of levels strung together, and by the halfway point I was very much invested in the whole effort and loving the humor. There is a good variety of enviroments and it took me 13 hours to finish without doing everything(but also not rushing through it). And there is seemingly a new update right around the corner adding a pile of content.  I couldn´t recommend BLACKHOLE enough.",

(Also   subscribe   if you'd like to see more!)  Pros: _Beautiful: Man, the game looks good. Colorful, and reminds me of something like Braid. Tha's a very good thing. _Controls well: Jumping and platforming feels terrific. Period. _Very, very, VERY interesting mechanics: The gravity changing system that is used for both traversal and puzzle solving is really really cool. Mind-bending and challenging. _Good music too. _Also, good voice acting.  Cons: _TERRIBLE WRITING! This might be the thing that make you not pick up the game. The writing is awful. It's bad. It's terrible. It's the worst kind of terrible, because it's terrible but it THINKS it's really clever. It's not funny or interesting. It's annoying, full of misplaced snark and sarcasm. This feels like it was written by someone who has never spoken English before and got their sense of humor from watching a single episode of Family Guy. On top of that.... _Long cutscenes: Holy ♥♥♥♥, this game wants me to hate it. The cutscenes are really bad, and the first ten minutes of the game is litterally just ten minutes worth of cutscenes with a few seconds of gameplay in between. When it's not in the cutscene, it's constantly taking control away from me just so it can make a snarky statement about the environment. Just shut up! I just want it to shut up and let me play!  This game will be for you if: _You skip all of the cutscenes and dialogues. _You like puzzle platformer with a really interesting mechanic. _You like pretty game with good music and terrific (albeit wasted) voice talents. _You actually like the game's sense of humor. Hey, I won't judge.  Is it worth $15? Yes, if you skip the entire storyline and just focus on the gameplay. Also, yes, if you like the storyline. Absolutely not if you're looking for good writing. Go play a Tim Schaffer game instead.  I will give this game a very tentative recommendation just due to its gameplay alone. But man, I hate this game. I wish I didn't, but I do.  Ugh, I swear to Christ, Auriel, if you don't shut your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mouth...  Shameless plugs time! Did you like my review? I do more than just that. I also have a YouTube channel where i do Let's Play as well as more reviews like these, but in video form. Come check it out   here  . My channel is small right now, but I play on making it a regular thing, so hit that subscribe button to see more content. Thank you!",

It started with “it will be easy, it won’t be hard” and I ended up with broken screen with chair on it.  The game description says: 'You'll need a lot of coffee to go through this'. Most likely you will need a lot of monitors (or laptops) and chairs.  EDIT: Nominated this game.",

You are the most un-important member of crew on Endera/SpaceShip. But something was happend and now you must be the true HERO. The developers usually saying 'This game is really hardcore... Other guys saying its like 2D Darksouls'. But I finished in this game basic story 3 times and my words is 'This game its definitely not 2D Darksoul maybe its easier than Super Meat Boy'. But this game have uniqe game mechanics. So you can manipulate with gravitation and that is really funny. So if you like Super Meat Boy, Battle Block Theatren and more... I think you would buy it. 8/10",
