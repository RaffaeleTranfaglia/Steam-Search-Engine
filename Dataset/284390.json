            "review_text": "I have absolutely enjoyed my time with The Last Door. At first I thought the Atari 2600 style (give or take) graphics would lessen the effect of the cosmic horror style storytelling, but I was wrong. It actually made things even creepier. The story is pretty top notch (Chapter Three is possibly the weakest in the set) and it reminded me of all the classic point and click horror adventure games I played in my younger years. Now, there aren't a lot of puzzles in the series save for the usual inventory based ones, but what the game lacks in testing your wits, it more than makes up with mood, style and atmosphere. I'm eagerly awaiting Season Two and if you're a fan of authors like Lovecraft, Bierce, Bloch, Chambers and the like, you'll absolutely fall in love with this game.",

            "review_text": "Who would have thought that the next great horror game would be a pixelated homage to Lovecraft and Poe? I had been following The Last Door's development since its Kickstarter roots, and as soon as it popped up on Steam the game was in my cart and my wallet $10 lighter.  The game starts off ominous enough; a suicide, a letter, and a friend vowing to uncover the truth of it all. Set in the 1880's, our protagonist Devitt embarks on a journey through forgotten memories that threaten to lead him to the depths of insanity itself. That's not exactly what I was expecting from this game, but I am certainly not complaining.  I realize the graphics are a turn off for a lot of people, especially considering how the pixelated art style is used in a lot of games these days, many of which are of questionable quality. However, if you can look past them and allow yourself to delve into the atmospheric world The Game Kitchen creates, you might find that the style works to enhance the game setting rather than take away from it. The best horror stories let your imagination fill in the blanks, which is quite often much more terrifying than anything the author can show you. Here, it is almost as if The Last Door provides your mind with a canvas of outlined images and then invites your imagination to paint in the details. The result is quite effective and works much better than I would have expected for a game in this medium.  What the graphics cannot infer is tasked to the sound design which does a phenomenal job of conveying actions that we are unable to distinguish from the low fidelity images. There is a memorable scene in which the screen goes black and we must experience events solely through audio clues. This again enhances the horror of the situation as your mind works to figure out what is happening through sound alone.   Mention must be made of the amazing orchestral soundtrack that helps set the time period and builds atmosphere while providing needed emotional cues as you make your way through the game. I am not exaggerating when I say the soundtrack is worth the price tag alone. Thankfully a downloadable version will be added to the Collector's Edition very soon.   Amazing atmosphere means nothing without a compelling narrative to pull it all together, and this is where The Last Door truly excels. Each episode is created very much like a chapter in a novel with a narrative structure that leads smoothly through the story while allowing the flow of events to move back and forth through flashbacks. This serves to build the protagonist's back story while unfolding the mystery in an engaging manner. As such, it takes more than a single play through to appreciate missed details that further develop the story. Once finished, the mini-sodes only available in this Collector's Edition fill in tiny details surrounding the characters and events, further building the world and mythos. The season ends in a cliffhanger with quite a few unresolved threads that lead into the next, yet the story is well rounded despite it. I can see the potential for this story translating into other mediums with how well it has been plotted, written and structured.  Having said all that, I have yet to mention anything about game play. When a story is this good, sometimes it is easy to overlook flaws in the game itself, not that there are many here assuming you enjoy classic LucasArts-style adventure games. The Last Door is your very standard point and click adventure that has you searching for items to complete tasks which opens up additional areas of exploration. The game logic is pretty straightforward without anything overly obtuse. Objective clues may take a bit of thought but make sense and are not too vague. Some of the game's difficulty indeed stems from the lower quality graphics making a few obtainable/clickable objects unrecognizable. However, the pointer does a good job of alerting you to areas that have actions, one just needs a little patience to thoroughly search their surroundings before moving on.   I can go on and on about the many things I love about this game, but it's best for one to fully explore and experience it for oneself. The Last Door exceeded my expectations in so many ways, I will surely follow and support these developers in their future endeavors. It seems as if finding a truly great indie game these days is like finding a diamond in the rough. Fortunately, this diamond sparkled bright enough to draw my interest.   One final note - The Last Door can be played on Kongregate for those who may be interested in trying it out before purchasing. Episode 4, however, is currently only available through game pledges on the developer's website and in this Collector's Edition, which also includes 4 exclusive mini-sodes and achievements.",

            "review_text": "Episode 1 was amazing. However I believe the rest of the game was funding by Kickstarter and I can only presume the undoubtedly deserved success inflated the creators ego.  Episode 2 is the polar opposite of Episode 1. We now have the introduction of 'cutscenes' and tedious dream sequences, that force you on to rails and to simply just keep clicking through them. The common annoyances of point-and-click genre, that were so excellently avoided in episode 1, all return in episode 2. For example:  SPOILERS  A music box item, that upon examination doesn't even tell you can't open it or use it. The only way you would discover it's use is by doing the classic, immersion-breaking, technique of attempting to combine all your items in your inventory together.  An NPC stands by a window, blocking your progress. However at no point are you told that you need to access the window or move the NPC to progress. Furthermore, there is no clue given as to which item you use to move the NPC. The only way this puzzle is solved is by systematically using the correct item in every room. This really dragged me out of the intense claustrophobic atmosphere the first episode immersed me in.  A statue requires an item placed in it, a fair point-and-click trope. However upon examination, there is no indication the statue requires something placed in it, or that it is possible to. The only way to solve this puzzle is by systematically trying all your items against the statue  END SPOILERS  The first episode flowed so well, was sensible and really drew me in. Then episode 2 threw me right back out, it's tedious gameplay stopping me from wanting to play on, despite the story starting to hook me.",

            "review_text": "I play a lot of so called 'pixel adventures' but The Last Door takes pixelation to a new extreme: sometimes it wasn't even immediately obvious what I was seeing. Add to that the lack of voice acting, and I was reluctant to try it. However, I soon discovered these are more deliberate design choices than artistic or technological shortcomings.  The game isn't particularly text heavy, but playing it very much gave me the impression of reading a classic horror novella. This is not just down to the 19th century setting and macabre style, or even its homages to Poe's short stories. It's more the de-emphasis of graphics and the old school Sierra-esque, almost poetic descriptions given when you examine your surroundings. It also occasionally employs a silent film aesthetic, cutting between captions and slides during cutscenes.   I feel all these things are executed well, because they add style, imagination, drama and depth without ever throwing a wall of text at you. They successfully took all these forms of classic written media and used video game interactivity, plus the occasional well-placed sound, music or jump scare, to enhance the experience. At times I found myself creeping forward, ever so slowly, ready to bolt, as if it were going to make any difference in a point &amp; click!  The Last Door's strong points are story, atmosphere, tension and way above average use of (stereo!) sounds. I highly recommend playing this one with headphones. I don't feel the graphics are particurly interesting, and (perhaps only because occult horror is far from my favourite genre) it's not my favourite point &amp; click of the year or anything, but I am glad I played it and I'd recommend it if either you're into this kind of horror, or you just want to try something different.",

The puzzles are challenging but not to the extent that you have to read the developers' minds to know the solutions.  More than anything, The Last Door excells at establishes an eerie atmosphere (even in pixels!) which creates a real sense of dread. But, unlike most horror games where you just want to yell at the stupid protagonist to turn back before it's too late, you find yourself drawn along by an insatiable and damning need to know. You actually feel like a character in one of Lovecraft's stories: ancient rites to malovlent, misanthropic entities unlocking awesome power beyond man's control or even perception, yet that to look upon or ponder these mysteries is to destroy one's sanity.",

            "review_text": "The Last Door (Season One) is a retro crowd-funded point and click adventure game with lovecraftian overtones. The protagonist, Jeremiah Devitt receives a letter from an old friend asking for his help and sets off on an adventure fraught with mystery and terror.   Visuals in TLD are minimalistic to the point of being almost incomprehensible and I immediately had flashbacks of playing old Sierra text-parser adventure games. Thankfully, there is a point and click interface. Additionally, the graphical minimalism actually works in favor of the player since, with larger pixels, there is less of a “hunt” to find interactive objects.   Puzzles range from generally easy to extremely easy with maybe one or two particular puzzles requiring the player to stop and think, so it’s best to go into TLD treating it as a story-based PnC game (a la telltale games) than as a serious adventure game.  The game is about 4-5 hours long and, for an average minimum sale price of $2, will give you just enough bang for your buck for a quick game to play over the course of a single evening. I’m looking forward to trying the sequel, once another sale rolls around. ",

            "review_text": "Horror is best served shaken, not stirred.   A classic Vodka Martini is a very simple concept. 3 ounces of Vodka, 1 ounce of dry vermouth, shake with 1 cup of ice until the liquid is cold, serve with a chilled martini glass and garnish with an olive. The same concept can be applied to the horror genre as well. A classic work of horror needs a good story, atmosphere, and intriguing characters.   So what do I mean when I say horror is best served shaken, and not stirred? Anyone can make a 'classic vodka martini', but in order to make a good cocktail one must look at the quality and quantity of the products, and how the cocktail is served. An example, the brine the olive rests in can change the overall flavor of the drink therefore cheap olives can sour the finest vodka. Most modern horror games lean on things such as jump scares or ambient sound, which can stir the player but it can also shift focus from a good story to concern about when and where the next scare might come from. A balance is needed to fully immerse the player so they can be shaken, but still enjoy the story.   The Last Door has flown under my radar for a good part of the year until it arrived on steam. I knew nothing of the devs (The Game Kitchen) and I was a bit wary of the graphics, could such simple graphics achieve a desired atmosphere needed to convey horror? With each chapter crowd funded could this hinder the quality as well? The Last Door: Collector's Edition is only the first season.   After playing the first chapter (or Episode) 'The Letter' I was hooked. The main character Jeremiah Devitt has received a letter from a childhood friend Anthony Beechworth, a simple but chilling message causes him to visit his home, seeking answers to what has happened to his childhood friend. By the end I couldn't wait to play the next chapter.   Carlos Viola is beind the music for The Last Door. For such a simple looking game I admit I wasn't expecting anything but simple. Sometimes it's good to be wrong and perhaps we shouldn't expect anything but enjoy what we are given. The music is like the perfect vermouth which accompanies a premium vodka. Each track is amazing and really sets the tone for the overall story. In horror atmosphere is everything and Mr. Viola does not disappoint.   I hope the second season comes soon. As I am writing this I can see the 5th chapter has been funded. Do I recommend The Last Door? Of course I do, I highly recommend it. In today's market there are many drinks on the bar menu but if you are ever in the mood for something premium with a great balance while being simple try a classic martini.   I also have Ornithophobia thanks to The Last Door",

However, this cryptic message prompts him to go to his friend's manor as he's aware that something had gone wrong. This is his first step towards madness, horror, darkness...  The Last Door is an episodic game, with four chapters. All of them is following DeWitt's fate and search for the truth. But while you're witnessing his adventure, cutscenes show also a doctor being worried for DeWitt and began to search for him. The plot is full of mystery, the more you're going forward, the less you can grasp the reality of the whole story. Well, it's still very foggy for me though I may have a general idea of what's happening. No wonder that there is a second season where you're the doctor...   The Letter   The Letter is the beginning of DeWitt's adventure. He's investigating his friend's manor. Everything seems normal but when you know where to look, it seems that this manor has seen a tragedy...   Memories   DeWitt, after finding his friend's body, comes back to his boarding school, now an hospice. Searching for clues to explain what's happening to his schoolmates, he begins to remember what they have done back then...   The Four Witnesses   After being knocked down by his ancient teacher's servant and after discovering the horrifying truth, DeWitt finds himself in one of these creepy neighboorhoods of London. A man seems to appear and to disappear, like he was inviting DeWitt to follow him...   Ancient Shadows   DeWitt found himself in a remote manor, where one of his classmates are residing. However, while investigating it, everything seems to suggest that Alexandre has gone far into his research...  As you can see, the more you're advancing in the story, the more horror you'll discover. Besides, be prepare yourself to some scares (I got one) and to people that aren't real (or are they just a fragment of DeWitt's imagination?).  The Last Door is a great example of how a plot must be delivered. Not too revealing at the beginning and then only, plant some clues and hints that will put a seed of doubt in your mind, until you're arriving at the end without too much clarity but with a general idea of what's happening.   The gameplay is a point-and-click: you have items to examine, to take, to combine and to use. You have also some puzzles, though they're a rarity in the game. Your inventory is in the bottom of your screen, making it easier for you to use objects. It's staying in place, never going down. You speak also with people: you can choose your lines, however, while some can be always asked, other ones are very important. And when you have a new piece of information, you can question again people.  You have also notes to read in all chapters, which will give you some clues on what's going on. Also, you can hunt some paranormal or strange actions, however, they're often secrets requiring to be fast or to avoid to do something or to just stay for a few minutes where you are.  However, be prepared also to some slow passages. Indeed, when DeWitt is holding a lantern, you're walking slowy, without any fast footstep. There is also a passage where he's kinda out of it, so, be patient.  The graphics are belonging to the retro era. I mean by that it's pixelised like a good old adventure game. You can't see any of the reactions of the characters, however, every area of interest are shown thanks to a magnifying glass with a yellow border.  The soundtrack is also captivating. It's really fitting to the story and to the atmosphere. I really like the opening.  The Last Door is really a masterpiece for the price. It's one of the best little adventure games that I've played.

You play a man who receives a letter from a friend you went to school with and from there it's a descent into psychological horror. Any more information would be spoiler territory and this game is best served with less information is more. Let me get this out of the way; I'm not the biggest fan of games using the AGS engine as I prefer a little more graphical heft but man, The Last Door had me hooked. It is not pretty graphically but it excels everywhere else. The story is engrossing, the sound design is amazing and the soundtrack is incredible. I didn't think it was possible to create an atmosphere The Last Door did using old school graphics like this but I was completely wrong. There are even some jump scares. And the 'prolugues' in this game. If these were AAA games they would have made headlines. I won't spoil it but certainly the prologue of the first game MAY turn a few gamers off. It's pretty heavy stuff. If there's one bugaboo to playing The Last Door is that the story is not completed but what's here is more than excellent. The few puzzles here are not terribly difficult so expect to put about 45 minutes to an hour into each of the four episodes available here, which is perfect. Overall I'd definitely recommend The Last Door even at MSRP of $10 but if you can get this on sale or even bundled (which is how I got it that's even better) An easy 8/10 from me.",

            "review_text": "I don't think I can fully express how happy I am with this game. I'll try to explain it on two fronts, however: as an adventure game and as a story.  I'm a long time fan of adventure games since before the time I had to finally upgrade my floppy drive specifically for playing one of them. (Okay, I'm not a spring chicken, but to be fair I am not a chicken of any sort, in case you were wondering - I have ulterior motives for crossing the road.) These days they're not as common, but a good one occasionally comes along. In recent years, though, I've not come across one that I would say deserves to be listed among the best of the classics. 'The Last Door' not only deserves such a distinction, I feel it surpasses a lot of my favorites.  Its interface is nicely simplified without seeming to limit your options or make solutions too simple to figure out. In fact, it leaves a lot of room for the developers to play a little dirty, offering a surprising new action for an object in your inventory without expressly telling you, but without making it too maddening to figure out. The inventory itself is always visible - there aren't a bunch of keys to learn or screens to open in this game, streamlining it and letting you focus solely on what's going on in the scenes, which I was eagerly doing (more on that in a moment).  Some of us adventure fans are considered masochists. If you ever played one of those old Sierra adventure games and wound up quitting the game, ranting and cursing, because of one of those stupidly ridiculous puzzles that seemed near impossible to figure out without a hint or a walkthrough, we were nearly as frustrated as you got, but for some reason we enjoyed it, maybe even for that reason. Usually. This means that a particularly devilish puzzle or lack of one can be both a turn-on and a turn-off for potential players of a game. What I've found happens in response to this is that adventure game makers either choose a side and go all the way with it - either making puzzles so routinely easy that classic adventure fans get bored or including a lot of stumpers that drives away the more casual fan - or try to ride a line in between. Those that try to ride the line tend to fail in numerous ways. Whether it was intentional or not, 'The Last Door' does a really good job of finding a middle ground. There were a few times where I had to stop and rethink my actions and goals, looking for what I had ignored or dismissed or simply not put together, however they weren't so difficult that I felt like the game had stopped while I figured it out. Meanwhile, for the majority of the puzzles, there was a logical elegance to them that generally weren't so ridiculously easy and pointless that I felt impatience with them or uninterested. (You can infer from how I described it how hard it is to ride that line.)  I have to address the retro graphics. This is, of course, something that you are either able to accept or not. I have no problem with them (and even smiled at the idea of it before I even played it), but I'm not one to begrudge people's preferences. I can understand if someone finds it hard to get into something with such low-res graphics as much as I can understand some folks' aversion to black and white film. However, if you're thinking of turning away from this because of the graphics, I'd like for you to stop and reconsider. While I appreciated it both for nostalgia and stylistic reasons, the game is worth playing even if you can't appreciate those reasons. Aside from its excellence as an adventure game, the story - which I'll get to in a moment - and other technical details makes this an experience I would hate for people to miss, particularly if you're a horror fan of any sort. One interesting thing to note is that while the graphics are late 80's/early 90's, the audio is fantastically beyond that and up-to-date. I would have suspected that this would clash in the area(s) of my brain related to nostalgia, but that audio is so superb and fitting that I rarely gave that a thought. The soundtrack is absolutely beautiful, with strains of haunted despair, darkness and terror thrown in for fitting moments. I would rate it higher than the soundtrack of any film in the last couple of decades. And then there's the foley. The sound effects in this game could almost tell the story by themselves. The atmosphere they create is palpable and visceral.  Finally: The story. If you are a horror fan, there's a good chance you have at least a passing familiarity with H.P. Lovecraft. There's also a good chance you've been very disappointed in attempts to tap his storytelling genius/madness in both films and games, often for similar reasons. If so, you have been waiting for this game. This is it. This one right here. In fact, I brought up film specifically because this game satisfied a hankering I've had for a really, truly good horror film in a way that I had begun to suspect could not be accomplished.  I think I'll leave off with that. There was more I wanted to say about the story, but I believe I've gotten across what I needed to say in that one paragraph. And besides, this has gotten to be a long review. I do definitely look forward to future chapters of this game.",

            "review_text": "The Last Door is an episodic point-and-click adventure game, inspired by LucasArts' classic masterpiece of the genre gameplay-wise, and by Edgar Allan Poe and Howard Phillips Lovecraft in terms of story and atmosphere. The game excels in atmosphere and style, thanks to the vibrant yet minimalistic pixel art (very few pixels, but a good deal of awesomely used colors), the Romantic-inspired orchestral soundtrack, a brilliant use of sound effects and a haunting story. With few resources, the game constantly unnerves the player, also employing some effective jumpscares. The story is not completed yet, it continues in the next season, which you'll instantly want after completing the four episodes contained in this collector's edition (for roughly 4 hours of gameplay). If you want an immersive adventure and love Poe and Lovecraft, this is an instant buy even if you aren't familiar with old school point-and-click adventures, thanks to the simple and logical puzzles which allow any player to experience this frightening tale. Highly recommended.",

            "review_text": "I had heard a lot of good reviews for The Last Door and I wasn't disappointed!  I really enjoyed a series that introduces a story that explores the folklore behind ravens and their connection to another world. Ravens are often thought of as being messengers or serve as foreboding warnings in various stories and poems; it was nice to see the developers create a unique story.  Also, it was a nice change of pace to play through a story that explored man's obsession with knowledge and the measures they take to unfold life's secrets.   I have to say, I enjoyed the first episode the most since there was a relaxed pace to it and I enjoyed being able to explore a creepy mansion. The atmosphere and music were amazing!  However, once the first episode ended, all the others seem quite a bit shorter; but they're still enjoyable and I liked the interpretations used in the second and third episodes. Sadly, I didn't enjoy the fourth episode as much since it turned away from horror and went on to suspenseful science fiction; not that that's a bad theme to use, but it didn't seem to fit well with the rest of the story or mood.  I can't give a full review until the series is completed; I hear the second season is currently in the making and I can hardly wait to play it and see what happens next!",

            "review_text": "The Last Door does what it can with what it has. How much enjoyment you get out of this game is entirely up to your personal preferences. Being crowdfunded on a relatively small budget gives the game both advantages and disadvantages. The biggest advantage being that the game is very tightly knit, I encountered no bugs or soft locks while playing. However, in my opinion the disadvantages that come with a small budget outweigh this advantage. A small budget leaves relatively no room for polish, this makes for some of the cheesiest and expected jump scares I have encountered in the horror genre. This has nothing to do with aesthetic, its timing and predictability. (I’ve played Clock Tower which is a good counter example of how a little polish goes a long way in the horror genre). A small budget also makes the game linear, devoid even of any perceived choice in both the narrative and the puzzle solving, all of the puzzles have one solution and most of the time the item will disappear immediately after one use.    The Last Door occasionally suffers from obscure puzzle solutions (like any game of this genre) SPOILERS:    The worst offender is in chapter 2 where for some reason you have to trick a nun into leaving her post by faking a miracle using a glass teardrop and a mirror on a statue of the Virgin Mary that does not have any descriptors indicating that the glass tear drop fits into her face.   On the same note this game suffers from the typical point and click trope of “you have A SOLUTION but it is not MY SOLUTION” SPOILERS:    The worst of it also being in chapter 2 where you have a glass mirror shard, a needle, a pointed gemstone, a rock, a sharp metal tool and rope netting that you could use to affix any of these sharp things to a stick to cut through a tapestry but you have to wait until you get a razor blade to move ahead.   That being said, nothing was a terrible pixel hunt which I feel is the worst way to extend gameplay in a point and click genre.   Overall, this game is a pretty meh way to spend an afternoon. You'd be better off spending your money elsewhere. I would not purchase this game at full price. Two to Three dollars is probably a fairer price for this game.",

I played through all 4 chapters just to be confronted with a silly message saying 'the adventure continues in season 2'.   Furthermore, a lot of people complain that the game requires Adobe Air to run on Linux, which is infamously unsupported. My own installation failed to start, but I found a post in the forums which solved it for me. Your mileage may vary.  Thirdly, as pointed out, it is not made clear to buyers that all chapters but the last one are always free, and the last one is a 'pay what you want' campaign, as this is how the game developers have decided to fund their game. Steam obscures this fact; therefore you may be a bit disappointed to find this out after you've paid full price.  As for the game itself, I had mixed feelings. I think the pixel art works well. The sounds and music contribute to great atmosphere. The puzzles were a bit random at times, but straightforward enough to not need a walkthrough.   But the story is little short of a haphazard collection of new age hippy crap. The first chapter is great as an intro and reels you in with its tense atmosphere, but then the rest just seem more of an afterthought, and trying desperately to piece together a story from nowhere, while playing the pseudophilosophical pseudointellectual card along the way, and relying on the odd 'jumpscare' tactic for effect instead.  The worst bit for me was chapter 2 which is basically a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ christian bashfest. - Tell the nun there's no god. Obviously she'll instantly agree and go kill herself because her life has no meaning. - Tell the head-nun a patient is in pain. Obviously she'll give you a bible and tell you to pray for him instead. - Try to distract the nun. Obviously place a tear on a statue of the virgin mary and she'll instantly go berserk about it being a miracle without even checking. - A student decides to read plato and aristotle. Obviously the priest will punish him for reading 'devil books' with 50 lashes. - People are dying in the monastery. Obviously the culprit is the head priest who like all priests is basically a deranged lunatic murderer with no respect for human life. (and obviously he likes to pray a lot while doing his killing, and obviously he personally employs shady characters to do the rest of his dirty-work. Obviously.)  I mean ... seriously? Gee! I'm surprised there were no paedophiles in the plot ffs! If I didn't know better, I would guess that the developers were a bunch of neoatheist 12-year old brats, constantly patting themselves on the back.  Don't waste your money.",

I would argue that the beginning and end of this season are the strongest points, striking the hardest and bringing the most suspense out of the fur; this doesn't mean that the middle two are bad, though! It is just something about the locations they are set in and the strange, almost dream-like occurrences that contrast starkly with more nightmarish/realistic nature of most of the action.  To give a concentrated package, though: a really good story wrapped in some fantastic music and sounds design. The audio and visual side help create tension and suspense, particularly the low-res pixel graphics make everything harder to make out, thus fuelling player's imagination, while not preventing from spotting anything. It is just darkness and pixels conspiring together to keep the details of everything around a bit vague. The game is very light on jump scares, but every episode introduces some genuinely creepy, unsettling scenes or locations.  Short (took me around 3.5h), but well worth the attention.",

I loved the intriguing tale so much that I bought the game again on Steam to play on my laptop or PC. I've played it many times over, and the same with Season Two. The cast resonates in their struggles, and among all the many, many low-res indie games, this one makes great use of the stark old-fashioned style to create a unique electronic peephole into Victorian-era UK. A fantastic original soundtrack by Carlos Viola rounds out the romanticism and tragedy of the story, and clever usage of sound effects polish the atmosphere to perfection.   Gameplay-wise, it is a point-and-click, which is, for me, very underused these days. The emphasis is on puzzle-solving, with challenges ranging from easy to moderate. It is possible and enjoyable to go through it without a guide. This depends on personal opinion and gameplay experience, but I did not find it frustrating or tedious. The puzzles were well-designed and fit with the story very well; some were downright creepy!   The developers of this game were very open and appreciative of the fan community during development. They even published graphical content free on Creative Commons on their blog. I've never seen such engaged developers, and that was a very refreshing thing to see.   In conclusion, I cannot recommend this game enough. I've played it over many times, and I'll play it again in the future. You can see the care that went into telling this story and crafting the gameplay experience. It sticks with you, even now that Season Two has concluded and the story is told.
