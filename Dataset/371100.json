Some of the item menus could be more easily sorted, but few other complaints. Here is an RPG to explore while waiting for your AAA title to be released.",

            "review_text": "Waste Walkers, developed by Corrosion Studios, is an open-world survival game created with RPGMaker. Now, I won’t beat around the bush; this is one of the most expansive and intricate games built on this engine, and it’s sure to steal more than a few hours of your time.  The story is fairly standard for a post-apocalyptic setting: The world has been destroyed by nuclear war and mundane life no longer exists. Normal people who lead normal lives must struggle to survive against the war’s aftermath. You’re put in the shoes of a survivor, separated from his/her family. Vague leads and shady individuals are your only guides, and you’ll take whatever you can get to find them.  As stated previously, this is a big game with a lot of stuff crammed inside. The map is littered in side quests, NPCs, monsters, and all sorts of things to explore. Just about every structure has an interior ripe with loot, and believe me, there is a lot of stuff to loot. In fact, a lot of your time will be spent away from the main quest line; mastering the maddness in this shell of a city.  Before going any further, there’s something that should be made clear. This game does not hold your hand. Apart from a short tutorial explaining some basic mechanics, you’re on your own. A lot is left for the player to figure out, and if you’re the type of guy who needs a big, shiny objective marker leading the way, you might want to give Waste Walkers a pass.  You’ve got your typical array of survival mechanics, such as a hydration and hunger bar, topped off with a radiation meter; however, food and water is in large abundance, so keeping healthy is not much of a challenge. What really makes this game difficult is combat, especially in the earlier stages. You start out weak and pathetic. Maintaining ammunition is a challenge at first, and trading punches with every beast crossing your path is NOT a good idea.   Waste Walkers is a game that encourages patience, and with a variety of different survivors to recruit, armor to find and weapons to wield, it won’t be long before you’re ready for a fight…. In fact, maybe you’re a little too ready; after you’ve leveled up and found some decent loot, Waste Walkers challenge goes down the drain. Just about anything will die within a few hits, and the tension slowly dissolves little by little.   Like I said, the game offers little hand holding. I started up Waste Walkers with the wrong frame of mind. I spent a few hours running around aimlessly, getting lost and dying over and over and over. I got so frustrated that I was tempted to quit altogether. To properly enjoy this game, you’ve really gotta know what you’re getting into. Take things slow and try to familiarize yourself with the map, the enemies, the loot, the world as a whole. But trust me; Waste Walkers can get addictive once you know what you’re doing.  I can only recommend this game to those who are well acquainted with the genre, or to those who want to be. But if you’re willing to take the risk, you’ll be in for one hell of a ride.",

I would HIGHLY recomment this to you! :D",

            "review_text": "This is one of the games that has revived my interest in these types of RPG games. While this kind of game does not have modern graphics it makes up for in story, immersion, painting a good enviornment, game mechanics and an interesting take on post apocalyptic setting.   Of the many pros for this game like the setting, story, hyrdation,radiation food and inventory style. There is really only one con that i can think of. That is the map that really can make a player confused when traversing the enviornment. The map has no indication of where you are other thne you making a not of landmarks. This is then pushed as a further con by the fact that the camera angle requires you to walk around buildings in order to even see what kind of building they are so you can make a note of them.  The other aspects of this game such as dialogue choices, taking care of your characters and making sure you pace yourself each day makes this game really unique even compared to modern rpgs that just have you on a set linear path and enticing you with the shiny flair and graphics that they can lord over to try and promote their game.",

            "review_text": "Unless you have a newer/good system I cannot recommend this game. On my computer the game runs at between 30 and 14 FPS. Most of the time the game runs closer to the 14 FPS side of things and at that side it is basically unplayable. I will include my system specs below so others know what you need to be above in order for this game to run well.  OS: Windows 10 (64-bit) Processor: 2.0GHz AMD Quad-Core A6-5200 Accelerated Processor Memory: 4GB DDR3L SDRAM Graphics card: AMD Radeon HD 8400 graphics  If you have a system that is older or not very robust you will probably want to pass on this game. It seems like it has a lot of potential but I haven't been able to play for more than maybe 40 minutes into the story due to the poor performance on my system. I will be doubling my ram in a few weeks and if I see any improvements in how the game runs I will update my review.",
