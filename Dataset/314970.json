            "review_text": "If I could give a neutral recommendation I would, but even so, since there's no such an option, unfortunately, I'll give NO. The game has everything that I like, it's simpler than most strategy games related to civilizations like  Sid Meier's  or  Age of Empire , but it brings some features related to those cited, like winning with a diplomatic vote, recognizing you as stronger nation, and happiness feature. Since these features are pretty simple, it makes the game simpler, making it faster, and I like that. Furthermore, it reminds me that famous old board game  WAR , where the number of your army matters. This game can be fun and enjoyable at the Single Player mode, but the Multiplayer mode is another matter entirely.   Strategy in Multiplayer Mode doesn't matter at all. Do you want to win? Just bring some friend to join you in game and attack together! Okay, I'm not saying that this should be prevented and It shouldn't. The problem is that the game has some flaws that makes it unfair. I'm gonna tell what happened to me:   There were no games available that haven't started yet or at least until 10 turns from the beginning, so I spent 5 coins to make a game, a lot of people was asking for it as well. 5 players joined and one of them was with his friend. Obviously, later on, they attacked me together. I managed to defend myself and luckily an AI killed one of the friend's king, so he lost to an AI. What really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off is that he left the game, joined again and picked the nation AI was controlling, that surprisingly was stronger than everybody. He had made an alliance with his friend again and declared war on me.  As the creator of that match, I couldn't do anything, not even kick him for this anti-game behavior. I told the  Age of Conquest Staff  this event and the answer I got is that when he leaves the game, he lose 13% of his rank so he's punishing himself.    Seriously? Like he would even care about it... What if only his friend that cared about rank position called him to do the dirty job and later on, give the victory to him? This would be a great strategy to get free coins and get to the top 100. I can also imagine people leaving the game after some strong AI declared war on them, join the game again and control the AI whose declared war, make it weak by deleting their army and positioning their king next to the last nation's borders they picked, leave and join once again, and kill the AI's king. In addition, there's no way that you can win a 2v1 match, although sometimes you can but you have to be really strong, which at that turn of the match I wasn't.   Again, the problem is not them attacking me together with their mighty fist of friendship, however there could be some features to prevent this exactly same unfortunate to happen, like just not allowing to join the same game after he had lost or quitted.  Game Over is Game Over .  That happens a lot, it's not rare to see friends joining the match just for the sake and glory of one.  So, I wanted to give a neutral vote because giving a NO is unfair. However, the game is slightly far from YES in the matters of multiplayer, which is, in my opnion, the most important. I know this review looks like I'm just mad because I lost, yet it would be innocence of one assuming that, if you didn't spent at least 50 hours at the game and not encountered this kind of players, and wouldn't get angry.  Moreover, the game has some User Interface issues like the grey background box and some buttons disappearing after game has ended.",

Still a few things that could be improved, but considering this is literally the only game that fulfills that niche it is a must, at least if you enjoy that type of game.  Generally free to play, there are maps that can be purchased, you start out with Europe only, there is also a different variant of Europe for free.   Apparently you can unlock those in-game as well, which would turn this completely Free to Play. Get it.",

            "review_text": "Disclaimer I FRICKING LOVE THIS GAME.  I Have only 4 hours playtime but i allready now this will be a 100 HR playtime for me its exactly what i was waiting for. A RISK game that actually uses the capabilities of a basic computer. I´ve been waiting for a game like this for ages.  Its extremely simple to learn but impossible to master. Its a perfect example of how much depth a game like this needs.   The management aspect is just as much fun as driving war. Tax management is simple but consideres all major factors: Happieness of population, size and wealth. War again is simple but as your lil nation gets larger and larger it gets more and more important to form alliences check who is alied with who ?, who is driving war ? Who is protecting this nation ? What defenses could they muster if **** hits the fan ? Is it smarter to ally, to drive war, to protectet, or ask for protection. And im just starting to play i havent even gotten into the multiplayer.  The perfect balance between size and depth.  AND MOST IMPORTANT. It doesnt force u to pay anything. I will do that but u dont have to. The base maps are more then enough to get all out of the game. Asking for purchases is humble and not intrusive. And most importantly i feel like i supportet a great game.  Well done Noble Master well done you guys are a shining example of how F2P should be made. Make a good game first and then think about how to monetize it.  Just download it and check it out u will not regret it.",

            "review_text": "Great game you really need to strategise or you can't win. Even though you have to buy most maps you still get 3 free: Ancient Europe, Medieval Europe and the Fantasy Map and all of them are fun. The fantasy map is MASSIVE, it took me 110 turns to finish it on CASUAL MODE! Multiplayer is also great but is also annoying when it takes 1 minute to end turn and you have nothing to do. Very simple too, its easy and quick to learn about the game as well.  Overall 8/10 Maybe make it so that enemies on the other side of the map aren't declaring war on you though. Also I suggest you add something were you can send a spy or something to lower enemy happiness to make them rebel. More types of buildings would be nice too. Good luck Devs I want to see this game grow. This has MASSIVE potential and I hope it lives up to it.",

Maybe more customization with the characters and nations where you can change your name and color, it would be awesome if there is more interaction messages with other nations like trading or join your war for an amount of gold.

However Single player is completely free, and does not require a constant internet conection.  My synopsis is this. If you want a fun little distraction.

All you get for the free version is the Fall of Rome map, which really only consists of Europe, some of africa, some of asia, some of the middle east but thats it.  If you want the complete world map or anything larger you will have to purchase them...  $20 for ALL maps, even future ones. $5 ish for individual maps.  Its a better version of Risk in my honest opinion. More extensive economy/military management.  Worth the $20? depends on how much you will play.  I am an avid Risk player and I am 50/50 in purchasing or not.  Sad to admit it but the more I play it the less I like it. Its fun having 60%+ of the map and being taken over by an AI that has literally 3 territories SOMEHOW............. Somehow they went through all of my defenses and territories and hit my leader... Somehow......... even when you're pretty limited on how far you can go each turn.... Hmmmmmmmmmmmm. Love wasting my time on top of wasting my time.",
