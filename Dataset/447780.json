And the mouse makes it arguably nicer to control than the Wii Remote.   The game is beautiful, charming, and sweet. The music is lovely. The game is short; the playtime you see on my profile is a full runthrough (albeit I still need to find a few more hidden collectables). So if you've got a couple hours to spare, you can't go wrong with this.",
