            "review_text": "Just not that good.... - Really short (took me 35 minutes to complete, and that's with me being lost and backtracking a lot). - Ending was very abrupt, and underwhelming. Just as it was building up again, it stopped with a silent video. - Majority of the rooms are the same, and have no reason for you to enter.  + Had a couple creepy moments. + Interesting stair section. Neverending, but only ever have to go up one flight to get back to the main level. Freaked me out. + Good audio. Really set the atmosphere. ",

            "review_text": "[KEY PROVIDED BY THE DEVELOPER OF THE GAME]  Pros: -Good graphics. -Kinda-good concept. -Great art. -The game is A LOT better than the demo.  Contras: -A LOT of unmodified Unity assets, specifically from Abandoned Hospital. -Many audio/event bugs. -The ending was the typical   'it was all a dream'.   cliche. -Lighting glitches a lot in low end computers/low graphic settings. -Invisible walls on the last part of the game really annoyed me. -The rooms are basically copypastes of the previous room.  Even though the game had more contras than Pros, I'm giving this game a positive review because it was really interesting. I really liked some parts were stuff happening was completely unexpected (an example is the   'welcome to hell''s infinite stairs part  ). Looking forward to the rest of the chapters!",
