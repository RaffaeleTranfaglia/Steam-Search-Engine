            "review_text": "Very beautiful game... Simply astonishing. I honestly have never played a game as beautiful as this one.   The concept is similar to QWOP, but this game is more smooth and fun; less frustrating. You play as Incredipede, a bizzare creature who's had her sisters kidnapped by humans. She has the ability to infinitely grow limbs from her body (distance limited). Four kinds of muscles are attachable controlled by AS and KL buttons.  The game takes about 13 hours if you play the Hard mode (in hard mode you have to create your own Incredipede for all levels, levels are harder as well) and probably 15 hours if you're dedicated enough to play player-published levels. At first though, the game can get pretty damn hard to control.  Another thing is the achievements. The game demands you to go outside and explore the real-world nature and learn about it more. The achievements are not checked in any way but I thought this was pretty damn genius. Good game to get little kids' ♥♥♥ outside.  Downside is that I actually expected each levels to be much longer than that - like an indie platform - it would've definitely been fantastic. Some players may also find the limb movements to be slow, but well, it didn't bother me.  If you're planning on buying this game, go ahead. I bought this for $2 during the sale and don't think $10 is worth the contents (even though the game is superb-eautiful).   Emoticon should be added!",

The Singleplayer has ~150 Level, some of them are really hard to solve. But really interesting is the Level Editor where you can create your own levels and creatures and share them to everyone. You can decide if the other players have to build the creature or if they have to use the one you've made for this level.  The creations always looks really funny then they walk or crawl on the ground.  Great game idea, creepy, funny and many challenges. 9/10  Check out my 'Humanoid' creation.        My humanoid&nbsp;",

By the time you get to playing it on hard (where you actually create your own Incredipede) you're just kinda over it. The Steam Achievements are fake, you can just get them by buying the game. I bought it on sale for 3.40 and I wouldn't pay anymore than that for it. Overall, fun for a bit but not worth 9.99.",
