            "review_text": "This game is simple to learn but difficult to master. The hardest difficult provides a good challenge. It is very satisfying to line up a shot off several lasers and blow up your opponent's Phaoroh. This is my new favourite boardgame and I would highly recommend buying it if you're into boardgames.",

            "review_text": "First of all I have to say that this game does not get the credit it deserves. I own the real board game Khet and the only difference in this khet is you can rotate the sorce of the lazer. Very good game but its hard to find players online who want to play a quick game with you .There are a few who play games that each turn can last 1-7 days, but whaiting that long is hella boring. Great game if you like chess or stratigy games in general.",

In every day life, I don't get to be strategic very often. It's nice to have a game in my life where I can plot, plan, and try to outwit my opponent. So in conclusion, if you like classic brainy games, give this game a shot.",
