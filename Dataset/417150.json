            "review_text": "This is probably the weirdest game I've ever played. It's a surreal game with beautiful music. Very surreal, I spent much of the time wondering what was going on. In a good way, I should add.  A few comments...  * No mouse support, which is weird at first since you're only controlling a cursor. I can see why though, since in some of the puzzles it'd be more difficult to use the mouse, but in those cases perhaps using wasd or similar would have been a good complement.  * There is no predefined steam controller button for bringing up the menu, you have to press ESC on the keyboard. Other than that, the game works fine with the steam controller.  * The puzzle mechanics can be a bit slow. The speed is good for the atmosphere though, so I wouldn't actually want it to be faster.  * This is a short game. Apparently I finished it in less than 3 hours.  * The ending is somewhat underwhelming. Be aware that this is only part 1.  * Some people have complained about bugs, but I didn't notice any, which is nice (running on Linux).  * In some places, some of the stuff on screen was blurry, a bit like if you were taking a close up photo with a big aperture. Not sure if that was intentional or not, but I didn't like it.  * You only need to understand the language for the menues, so if you're not good at any of the available languages then you shouldn't have much problems anyway (although you'll probably not understand this comment in that case... oh well...).  Most of these points may seem kind of negative, but the negativity is actually pretty much just nitpicking. So, in conclusion, I liked the game and I'll probably buy both the DLC and the next chapter (when it's released).",

            "review_text": "Huuuuge disappointment! Cannot recommend at all!  I was really looking forward for this game, I liked the soundtrack and the 'Sanitarium' mojo. Sorry, but Pavilion fails in so many levels in comparisson with Sanitarium. My thoughts and feeling after finishing published content:    so far the game ends in its half. Okay, it's in a description and I sort of missed it - my fault. Anyway, I really hate this publishing model, especially in narrative games.     no mouse control! In a game where the player controls ONLY a cursor! Controlling via keyboard is like an attempt to shoot the moving target while riding a wild horse. I don't get dev's excuse about difficulties in mouse control implementation. In a last chapter I was so consumed by anger and cried loud with frustration, because of need of precise timing which is - again - pretty hard and dumb thanks controlling a cursor via the keyboard.     it's buggy as hell! Missing textures, cursor can be moved out of the levels borders, in one level cursor get stucked in one place and the only option how to proceed is exiting the level (tried three times - always the same result). I paid for the finished product, not for the buggy beta!     animations are really cheesy. I wasn't expecting something like Inside animations, but this remains me games 20 years old.      just three puzzle mechanics - basically lights, bells and blocks (and trains, which are practically same as blocks) - puzzles become quickle repetitive and boring... some mechanics are just denoted and not used afterwards during gameplay (wolfs, falling and healing)...     speaking of trains - it's just a detail, but as a trains fan I was really annoyed by 'train crossroads' - sorry, but it's just a mechanical nonsense...     no direct narrative - it may work in certain adventure games, but it doesn't work in case of Pavilion. It's just a strictly linear puzzle solver with few fragments of storytelling... enviroment may be beautifull (also sort of corny), but it's repetitive and really doesn't push the story forwards.     painfully linear - there's almost no exploration, no find/use mechanics, almost no path selecting, no nothing - just few simple logic mechanics, so that there's no reason call Pavilion 'adventure game'. Pavilion simply lacks complexity of a proper adventure game.   Conclusion: nice looking pictures and pleasant soundtrack. The rest is very disappointing in many levels.",
