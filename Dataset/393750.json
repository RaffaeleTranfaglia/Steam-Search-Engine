            "review_text": "P·O·L·L·E·N is an atmospheric, sci-fi exploration game played on Saturn’s moon Titan. Basicly, you open doors and move unit to unit in space and space station by finding required material such as keys. You have to solve some simple puzzles using electronic devices. The best and great feature of the game is it has very detailed objects, maybe almost everything in a space station and its worth exploring these with the great environment. Graphics are very nice. Gameplay is not bad. Note that i dont play VR, i play normal.  However i cant recommend this game. It has terrible optimization: while i play 60+ fps, it feels like 20 fps. Another problem is some crashes to desktop i experienced. Last one is the price should be at least a bit cheaper.   Summary: Assertive and beatiful game with optimization problems and a high price.",

            "review_text": "TL;DR: Short game, most likely because it's meant to be a VR experience rather than a full, story-driven game. Still awesome.  Pollen isn't a very long game, only took a few hours, but it's still pretty neat. The game plays well, nearly everything is examinable, sound and texturing are really good as well. Only problem I had was opening doors. The game would freeze and stutter for about 12-15 seconds opening doors into big rooms, otherwise all was good. Unfortunately I don't have any VR headsets so I couldn't enjoy this game as it was meant to be played, but I got it because I love first person story/puzzle games like Myst, SOMA, etc. I can understand the price point as well, since this is meant to be a VR game, and if you have a VR headset I could imagine this game would look incredible on it, especially the ending.  Fun game. Would love to play this in the future once I get a VR headset.",

            "review_text": "  What an excellent adventure. Mindfield has captured a very intesive atmosphere into the game. First 20 mins into gaming I was terrified that something will jump at me from the dark. After a while I got more relaxed and started to enjoy the story itself. Trying to find answers to a questions lingering in the air. What happened? What have they found? What is this entity? I did not make any research about the game before trying it out and I was surprised that I played it through in about 3 hours. But after reading more reviews and such, I found there are many way to play it through. Which makes sense as there was plenty of questions left unanswered. I definately will give it a second run, maybe even third.  Great game for those, who like more movie kind of experience, solving puzzles and good atmosphere. Not for those who are looking for things to shoot and kill everything. Good work Mindfield, well played.",
