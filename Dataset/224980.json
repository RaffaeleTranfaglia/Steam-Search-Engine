            "review_text": "Tomb Raider 4: The Last Revelation was the best TR game in my opinion. Why? Because it was a Tomb Raider game since the first one that was actuall about exploring tombs and fighting monsters (With a little appearence of bad guys). That said, let's go to the topics:  Graphics: Pretty good for a 1999 game, actually. Texture variation is not so present because ambient is also not. That's because you will be put in on closed spaces more than open ones. Pyramids, temples and hidden tombs will be more seen than anything else. But the presentation of these places are actually nice, it doesn't get repetitive and you always know when a place is new or not.  Gameplay: Picking up the style from the other TR games, it remained the same with a few additions. Lara can now jump into ropes, walk in them and best of all: DRIVE VEHICLES! That was a nice little adition, tough i din't find the vehicles gameplay so pleasurable for me. At least at a long time ago. For me, now isn't that bad. It's pretty ok. Gunplay feels the same from other games and doging from enemies still feels impossible, tough, as in other games, exploring is the key too fill up with medkits and ammo. Not much problem here. Puzzles are back and were the main focus of the game. You will waste more time on puzzles than killing enemies. They are complex, but not hard to do. Remember when i said i couldn't remember if the secrets followed the same pattern as TR 5? Yeah, it follows. Global statistics for secrets, no statistics per stage. And this game is HUGE, it is a big flaw to make harder to find the secrets in this game. At least, you don't win anything by finding it all, besides new weapons/items on your gameplay. Exploration is the key, once again.  Soundtrack: More or less. Most of the time you will only hear ambient sounds. But when music plays, it always match with what's happening and feels like an epic adventure. Voice acting is quite decent and Lara's voice is sweet.  Story: Here was the big point of this game. The plot tried to explore a bit of Lara's past at the beggining and tried to connect to the actual story that was happening. It went pretty well and many things have been done. A lot of effort was put in the Seth and Horus backstory and as more as you explore, more content is revealed. The game goes roughly for a lot of time because of this. It all went you...Until the ending. The boss battle felt so empty for me and the ending itself was quite sad and a cliffhanger.  TR 4 was the best game of the franchishe for me and it was pleasurable to play. The focus on the adventure more than action served this game well for me and it made an unique experience. If devs that are doing the new Tomb Raider were to see a game where they could see what they SHOULD do with the series style of play, it should be this one.",

            "review_text": "This is definitely my favourite Tomb Raider game to date - it's classic Lara, with some of the most fiendish puzzles in the series and an awesome storyline to bring it all together. The introduction of linked levels that you can travel back and forth through at your leisure brings a totally new dimension to the game, and although it can start to feel a little long-winded towards the end, it's entirely worth it to be able to see all the gorgeous levels and experience the story. As long as you're prepared for a little frustration when it comes to a few puzzles, this game is Lara's best.",

I think I must have completed it about 30 times.  This game is my favourite game of all time. From the title screen music to the final boss fight, there isn't a moment that isn't amazing, challenging or just lovably goofy (read: The Guardian). The story is meh, but the level design and locations are just so, so great.  I'm not sure if it's just childhood nostalgia, but I'd recommend this game to anyone anywhere. It's what got me into gaming, and years later I'm still enjoying it even though I know it back to front.  Do yourself a favour and try this out. It's pretty cheap, so you're really getting your worth and then some.",

Pretty much all of the levels are connected, now, and with the addition of the need to backtrack, this game is structured quite differently, almost a bit like a metroidvania, albeit without the vertical elements. Add to that several good additions like shattering pots with your gun, or aiming down a gun's sights, and this game's probably, nostalgia aside, the best entry in the first 6 Tomb Raider games.",

            "review_text": "I have mixed feelings about TR4, but overall I think its an improvement on the earlier games.  In this there is a very marked improvement in the graphics, most noticeably on Lara, who is no longer a series of disjointed cubes and polygons. On top of this there are more varied environemtns, with less of a 'blocky' feel to them. Also, playing these games on a modern computer, TR4 is the first one where there haven't been any major problems while playing the FMV cutscenes. The game still has some issues playing at higher resolutions, but that is only to be expected.  In addition to this, there is an improvement in the storytelling, I find. This game is the first where everything seems to follow a logical storyline, and the use of fmv and in-level cutscenes does a good job of telling this. Rather than jumping everywhere around the world, you stay in Egypt, which I feel gives the game more of a chance to build up the story than the previosu ones, which jumped about a lot.  One down side to this game is that it has a lot fo the two things which I like the least about tomb raider games: Vehicles and Backtracking. If you've played a TR game before, you know how bad the vehicles are. Clunky and terrible, but you need to them to progress the level. The back tracking isn't too bad in this game, so I guess that's more a matter of personal preference.  The controls are not said to support xbox controllers, but it actually is possible to use one without resorting to a third-party tool, although you need to manually configure it, and it only seems to support one analog stick.  All in all, if you are new to TR and want to play one of the earlier TR games, I think this would be a good one to play.",

            "review_text": "Tomb Raider IV The Last Revelation originally released 17 years ago, still an excellent game, except the old mode of operation and the keyboard settings which cannot be customized. So, please make sure to use a standard keyboard (laptop keyboards often do not have a numpad), otherwise you will lose a very important function - 'Perspective (numpad 0)' and almost impossible to finish the game.   I bought it from Steam again after so many years, just because I miss its Egyptian scenes, puzzles, and tense story. Best game in 1999, my childhood memory.",

I love them, they're my favourite games.  The Last Revelation is easily the best in the series.   However, this is a trainwreck of a port. It took me hours and hours of fiddling with it to get it working, not to mention the aspect ratio isn't designed for widescreen monitors and required me to download a fan-made patch to make it. Accordingly, I cannot reccommend this version  You'd be better off just getting it on GOG or even the Playstation Store.",
