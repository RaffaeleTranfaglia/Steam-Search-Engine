            "review_text": "English ------------ Deutsch  Deathrap doesn't seem very appealing at first sight, but so far it sure is the best Tower Defense I've ever played. I'd describe it as a mixture between a Tower Defense like Orcs Must Die 2 and Dungeon Defenders and an Action/RPG like Diablo and Torchlight 2, in a much darker tone. If you played one of them, you'll love this one too. This awesome game definitely needs more attention!   ++ advanced skill tree for 3 different classes ++ 25 different/unlockable traps and more than 150 trap upgrades ++ scenario, endless and a vs. mode ++ rewarding side quests (more loot) ++ crafting/enchanting system ++ various weapons/armor for character customization, from normal to godlike ++ tactical, because of various enemie types ++ different maps and difficulties (collecting 3/3 stars on every map) ++ max Lvl: 100  +/- forced positions/spots for traps  -- only three classes  Still waiting/hoping for any DLC's or Deathtrap 2. Will purchase them in an instant!  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Deathrap wirkt auf den ersten Blick nicht besonders ansprechend, gehört aber auf jedenfall zu den besten Tower Defense Spielen die ich je gespielt habe, wenn nicht sogar DAS beste. Ich würde es als einen Mix aus einem Tower Defense wie Orcs Must Die 2 und Dungeon Defenders und einem Action/RPG wie Diablo und Torchlight 2 bezeichnen, in einem deutlich düsteren Ton. Dieses großartige Spiel verdient/braucht definitiv mehr Aufmerksamkeit!  ++ umfangreicher Skillbaum für 3 unterschiedliche Klassen ++ 25 verschiedene/freischaltbare Fallen und mehr als 150 Fallen Upgrades ++ Szenario, Endlos und ein VS. Modus ++ lohnende Nebenquests (mehr Beute) ++ Crafting/Verzauberung System ++ viele verschiedene Waffen/Rüstungen zur Charakter Anpassung, von normal bis godlike ++ taktisch, wegen der vielen unterschiedlichen Gegnertypen ++ unterschiedliche Karten and Schwierigkeitsgrade (3/3 Sterne auf jeder Map sammeln) ++ Max Lvl: 100  +/- nicht frei wählbare Positionen/Flächen für Fallen  -- nur drei Klassen  Ich warte/hoffe noch immer auf DLC's oder Deathtrap 2. Diese würde ich ohne mit der Wimper zu zucken sofort kaufen!",

If you didn't played but you like the TD genre, you cannot go wrong with this one. And if you don't like tower defense games at all, well then that's really bad for you.  ",

            "review_text": "Here's a game by Neocore, the creators of the Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing series. If you haven't played those, they're pretty decent hack and slash games in the vein of Diablo - and also the reason why Deathtrap exists. In the first game of the trilogy there were a few sidequests based around a tower defense minigame, where you used Van Helsing, his ghost companion Lady Katarina, and an outpost's arsenal of traps to defend your lair. They were a neat diversion, and proved popular enough to get expanded on in the sequels, and get its own spinoff title.  Deathtrap takes place in the same universe as Van Helsing, across a series of fortresses found in the Ink, a general otherwordly dimension you often visit for one reason or another. They were built to defend the human realm from the monsters found within, and you play as an adventurer who for whatever has decided to take up that task now. These are one of three classes: the close-quarters, tanky Mercenary, the fragile, spell-hurling Sorceress, or the ranged, hit-and-runner Marksman. All have their own skill trees, some of which are your standard ARPG stuff of passive bonuses and attacks, while others boost your traps. They also have their own dedicated upgrades, which are either unlockable boosts for them in the levels or passive stuff which is less potent but always active.  The levels play out largely the same as they do in Van Helsing, save for your character probably not having the array of skills he can. You're still able to contribute, but the towers will be the brunt of your offense. Most of them are lifted from their parent game, and include guns, spikes, burning floor tiles and even pits of monsters who fight for you. A lot of them enemies are also most of what you fight in Van Helsing, and have the same qualities such as resistances, auras that buff other enemies, and going berserk at low health.  This all makes sense given that you're in the same universe as the games that came before, but it still makes Deathtrap come across as a bit of a hand-me-down title. An expensive one, too, as it retails for twenty dollars when not discounted, five more than the Van Helsing games. Not that those games are bad or that this one is; I had fun playing them and so far Deathtrap is some decent fun. But it doesn't exactly stand on its own, and so far I haven't done much I didn't do in Final Cut. If there was anything you didn't like about the combat in that, such as the combat lacking a bit of punch, that would still apply here I think. Progression also seems to be about the same as in its big brother, which seems like a bit of a problem since you're only given new equipment, gold to buy it, or materials to craft things at the end of every level. You can get extra chests in some levels by killing optional enemies during waves, but it's not a huge boost.  Deathtrap also seems like it's a bit of a short game, with only thirteen levels, four of which I've finished in about two hours. There are higher difficulties for them the game encourages you to build your character up for, but it's overall not a grand adventure like Van Helsing was. It's probably a bit unfortunate they linked the two games together in so many ways, because this isn't a bad title at all, if you wanted more in that vein but wanted to take a break from Final Cut or whichever game you were on it'd be fine for that. But if you didn't like them, or don't much care for hack and slashes in general, this might not be the one to change your mind. Either way, I'd get it on sale.",

            "review_text": "I'm a big fan of the original Dungeon Defenders and own DD2. So I spent some time trying to research how different this game was or if I should just sink my time into DD2. I saw discussion threads where people were having a really hard time describing the differences and I couldn't understand why. Now that I own the game, I understand why. While the surface mechanics are the same, they play very differently and I'm not sure which I like more.  Pros: Well balanced skills and traps Enemy diversity to include champion variants ARPG style loot, but not overwhelming since it's not per enemy kill I find the unique graphic style more appealing than DD2 I prefer the isometric view as well Class skills and passives that actually differentiate the classes Tons of upgrade combinations per trap, both passive and active User made maps and easy editor  Cons: Only three classes All classes have the same trap selection Traps are placed in set locations (but with options of which trap to place) Loot only awarded upon level completion Huge potential grind of replaying the same maps (need 3 stars on hard to unlock next tier)  Overall I really like the game. Being able to speed up or slow down the pace means easier waves are shorter. The interfance and experience just feels smoother and more polished than similar ARPG/Tower Defense games. While there are limited classes I think the customization options and potential for huge number of user made maps more than make up for it. It was definitely worth the sale price and if you're a fan of tower defense games then well worth the full retail price.",

            "review_text": "Deathtrap is a tower defense game with strong action RPG elements. This game is brought to us by Neocore Games, the developers behind the excellent Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing, and this just might be the best game that they've made so far.  At first I thought Deathtrap was just another Van Helsing game with a different name, but as soon as I started the game I saw how wrong I was. This is a true tower defense game that allows us to control our own character too. Before each wave you can run around the map placing all sorts of different traps down to fight off each wave. At first I only had access to a turret and a poison trap that shoots up acid at any enemy that steps on it.  They didn't do much damage at first, but after I upgraded them I didn't go a match without them. Even when I got to higher tier maps I still found myself going back to my good ole acid trap because it did a ton of damage on my enemies.  In addition to laying down traps you can also fight alongside them with your character. The three character classes are your basic warrior, mage, and rogue, but they come with vastly different abilities. My personal favorite character is the rogue while the warrior is my least favorite.  Once you've gotten enough experience points you can level up both your character, and your traps. As you level up new traps will become available for you to try out. Once I got access to a trap that let me make archer units I immediately focused on upgrading them to maximum.  The gameplay in Deathtrap is nothing short of great. It plays like Van Helsing, but the tower defense elements really stand out and make this game different enough to stand out on it's own.  The soundtrack is the best I've heard this year; I really love the opening song at the main menu and stage selection screens. I wish there was more though. There are only a few tracks in the game, but they're all easy on the ears.  Graphically this game looks as good as The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing games. Everything is rich with detail. The character animations are solid, but it's nothing spectacular and the voice acting is a bit on the weak side, but who plays a tower defense game for the voice acting.  If you don't want to play this game alone you don't have to. You can go through the entire game with a friend in cooperative mode or even go head to head in some great pvp action.  If you're looking for some great gameplay set in the Van Helsing world than look no further than Deathtrap.     The Verdict: 8/10  ",

            "review_text": "This game is actually brilliant. Being a fan of tower defence games, and Games like Sanctum/Sanctum 2, i have to say that this game is right up there with the other games.  Gamplay 8-10 The gameply is fun, and addicting, each match can last from 10 minutes to half an hour and probably even longer in the harder levels. the gamplay is quite simple. just defend a portal that leads to the real world. waves of enemy are trying to invade the real world using portals and the only way to stop them is by setting up traps and towers, along with firghting yourself. there are currently 3 classes the sorceress who is able to use magic to defend all incoming lanes at once or is able to quickly take down/defend one lane really quickly, the ranger who uses guns and distance weapons * havn't played much of him yet) and a heavily armoured character(can't remember what class he is and again havn't played him much) Each of these classes have differeent skills that you level as you progress. Deathtrap alos has an rpg element as you can roam around the levels as the defending stage is going on and defeat map bosses and gain keys to chest littered throuout the stage.  Graphics 7/10 truthfully, i enjoy the graphics at first glance i did not, and thought they were not that good, but in game the look decent. it complements the game completely. The blood and effects are all quite nice and allow for the gamplay to look better.  Story 2/10 So far from what i know the story is simplistic in nature. the gist is that you are in these ancient ruins ( or something like that, again i havn't played through the begining cinematic/information more then once) to which the humans defended agains monsters centuries beforehand. and as you are in these ruins the monsters apear again and it is up to you to stop them from reaching the portals. ( again i will probably update this review the more i play)   Overall 7/10 So far it is a brilliant game, i am yet to try the co op experiance but i am sure it will make it even better.",

It is well designed with an excellent mix of tower defence and hero leveling that makes the more time you spend playing the more fun and diverse the game becomes. The tier system makes everything exciting all the way to level 60. After that aquiring godlike items and seeing your specific character and tower combination strats become fully realized it makes every game fun. The multiplayer, in it's current form (early release had some issues that have since been resolved), is excellent and stable.  The four tiers of levels (each tier changing the layout) and four tiers of towers give you lots of paths to go down with your decisions. Having the ability to buy back your tower tower upgrade choices and try different tech paths shows just how smart the developer is and this game was clearly created by someone that loves tower defence games.  Being able to play multiplayer with your friends, each using their own strats and working together to for a common strat makes the game one of my favorite TD games I've played yet.  The developer has been very active in tweeking the game and taking suggestions from the community.",

It would take less than 2 hours to earn that at work, so even if I paid full price it's well worth it.  I literally only opened this just to see what to categorize it as in my library and ended up playing for 5 hours straight... that should tell you how encapsulating this game is! Great combination of 'MOBA' feel with 'Tower Defense', with upgrades that feel good, no hand-holding (play on hard mode, it's not that hard and it's more challenging and fun!)  I am mad that I have to put this down for a while. Can't wait to come back and play some more. I played the sorceress class and it's great fun due to the spell casting and all that.  I don't know, yeah, try to get it on sale, but don't let the red 'Mixed' fool you, because I'm a picky gamer, I hate almost everything, and I had a blast.

This is the updated review.  If you played Van Helsing, you're probably aware of the base defense quests. They felt forced in, and broke up the flow of the game. Here, that kind of thing is the whole game, and it stands pretty well on its own. They kept the gear and skill systems from VH, but made the skills focus on traps and towers rather than making the player character into a death machine them self.  You can still be a death machine though. You probably won't get far completely ignoring towers, but a few well placed skill points will make you more powerful than any tower you can build. You can lock down one path on a map with towers, then go murder everything on another path yourself, if you wish.  The game itself has personality. The voiceovers have emotion, the music is catchy and really presents a feeling of urgency to the battle ahead, and the battlefields feel like blighted woods, ancient ruins, and hidden machinations of lost technology. It all blends very well together to create a world you can just dive into.  There's a ton of replay value, as you'd expect in a game combining RPG and TD elements. There's 13 'Campaign' maps that form the core storyline, with three difficulty levels, most of them also containing a side-quest to go for during the chaos, then four 'Tiers' that unlock as you complete the story. Tier IV Hard on these maps will require a fully geared character and a ton of skill.  On top of the Campaign, there's several maps that unlock after you beat the game that are designed for Scenario mode. Scenario mode allows you to take on certain debuffs in exchange for more rewards. You can play Scenario Mode on the Campaign maps too. And finaly there's Endless Mode, which is what it says on the tin.  On top of all of that, you get the Workship/map-editor, coop mode, a PvP versus mode... the game is quite huge. My one complaint of it all is the gameplay can get kind of samey and grinding once you've finished the Campaign, but I'm the kind of person who enjoys building up a character and getting to ridiculously high waves in endless TD games, so this one is right up my alley.",

Some maps also have optional side quests for bonuses. + RNG loot, extensive skill trees, extensive trap upgrades + Workshop support for user generated maps, Multiplayer Co-Op and Versus modes  - Some maps are way tougher than others (because of trap nodes you have to use) - Some of the character skill options seem frivolous (it's overwhelming at first) - A few technical issues still being reported (I didn't experience any myself)  This game is a Deathtrap of personal time, social activity, and personal hygiene regiments. With more DLC planned including additional characters, this game still has a lot of things to look forward to atop an already complete and truly satisfying package. Very much recommended for Tower Defense-hyrbid fans of games like Dungeon Defenders as well as anyone who enjoyed the defense of the base portion of The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing 1 &amp; 2.",

Pros: + 3 Characters with skill-tree (rpg elements) + Many different traps, which can be boosted in several ways + High replayability of levels due to the option to make it more difficult for more xp or loot + Playable with Controller (but inventory control is horrible) + Coop play is possible + Satisfyingly popping Monsters  Cons: - Classes are a bit unbalanced, in my opinion the Marksman is way better than the other classes - You can place traps only on certain spots, which makes the game quite scripted - You have way too much gold in the game which cant be spend on important things, because the equipment you can buy in the shop is mostly crap and there is no other use for money. (Except resetting your skilltree which is ridiculously cheap)  All things considered is the game a rather good tower defense game with many rpg elements. Due to the good replayability the game will entertain you for a good while, when you like to loot&amp;level!",

You create a character of one of three classes and then can (try to play) play co-op (online only no local :( ) with up to three others or can do solo in campaign mode. There's not much of a story to the game, but there are brief readings associated with each level that provide some context. Combat consists of activating towers with a substance called essence. You get essence at the start of each level and can acquire more by killing enemies. Towers come in many different varieties and your character can make contributions to the fight based on abilities and default actions. Upgrades, crafting, and a shop feature make this game even better by allowing your character and towers the chance to adapt to new levels and challenges; in this way an RPG element is introduced. I'm not too far in yet and can appreciate the replayability of levels and the challenges offered. Outside of issues with connecting on co-op I can really get behind the other aspects of the game. I got it in a bundle, but would have paid full price based on my experience.",

It gets very repetative, and as you become better at the game, the enemies stay true to themselves and do exactly what they did the first time around (just with more health....) and so it doesn't get anymore challenging. If anything, it gets easier..  Whilst the game has a fairly large quantity of bugs and glitches and errors that cause crashes, I'm VERY surprised the game came out of early access.. I mean, I didn't even know it was out for ages as there was no mention of it from what I remember. Oh well, doesn't change the fact that their own roadmap seems to stop December 2014 and whilst they say in every single post 'more to come, it's early days, work work work', there hasn't been a single update and the game is massively lacking by this point imo.  I loved this game from the second I started playing, but sadly it didn't keep my attention for all too long and it's a shame, as it had everything it needed to go VERY far.. But the devs seem to have not cared and let it die very quickly. 6/10  Original review:  Great game - Lot of fun - Nice graphics and (for me) a perfect mix between Diablo and TD games. Ignore my low hours I have been busy lately most evenings but trust me I cannot wait for the weekend for this game ;)  Visuals - Very smooth! Graphics aren't the best in the world, but it is still very nice regardless and it is early days - Maybe updates/DLC's might provide a little bit more in the future. 9/10 for me.  HUD - Some of the layout of skill tree / trap tree could be a little less 'cluttered'.. Sometimes I'll not know which text box is for which, but that isn't involved in a game so it is hardly noticeable since you spend 1/30th your time there..  Skills and traps look awesome - And there are plenty of them too. Its a great blend of an RPG with TD - You get the character and customisation feel for you plus the TD asspects with all those traps (18 I think) but who knows as I said it is early and more may come :D  Overall for this (quick andm essy review - Sorry) 9/10 for me!",

You gain more traps as you level up and this part of the game is just amazing to play. It plays a little like omd and DD2. The ability to create your own custom maps is highly appreciated, some of the maps made by the community are great and fun to play. The creation of your own map is extremely easy.

This is important to note because I want you to know that I did not purchase this game, and probably would not have even looked at it.   Now, I love dungeon crawlers. Exploring a map, hacking up monsters and collecting loot are things that I enjoy -- and that's the problem, I enjoy the exploration aspect of it.   I (and I can't stress this enough) HATE real-time strategy games, horde modes, tower defense games, DOtA and League of Legend style games... So this game is not for me, because you're pretty much just guarding a 'core' throughout the game.  That said, I lost all interest in playing it before the end of the first tutorial. It doesn't help that this game has the blandest color palette this side of 'Limbo,' but teasing me with hacking and slashing and failing to capture me on every other point is just not enough. It seems to be put together very well, and As I don't enjoy (and therefore do not play) this type of game, don't let my distaste for it sour you on trying it. Who knows?
