            "review_text": "In the 90s, Star Trek: Starfleet Academy was heavily anticipated and it was supposed to be best Star Trek game ever. Certainly, it ended being a great game but did not end up meeting the hype and high expectations. Years ago, I bought the physical copy of Starfleet Academy but didn’t realize that a working joystick was essential and all the controls you had to memorize was overwhelming at the time so I gave up on the first mission.  Imagine my excitement when I picked it up on sale recently and now I finally get to give it a second chance. As a big Trek fan, I really enjoyed it. The basic story is you play as cadet on the command track who is working his way through Starfleet Academy by completing a bunch of simulations and at the same time, you must manage all the different personalities of your crew. The game does a good job with its FMV (full motion video) cutscenes which were common in so many 90s games though some of the acting needs improvement. Periodically during these cutscenes, you will have to make several choices which will change the direction of the story and affect your crew’s performance. William Shatner, George Takei and Walter Koenig do a fantastic job reprising their old roles from TOS.   You could tell the simulations/missions were TOS era “let’s blow them up” as they were really heavy on combat with a bit of diplomacy thrown in on the side. Actually too heavy on combat even for Kirk himself as some missions have you destroying several ships to complete your objective. I would have liked to see a better balance of diplomacy and action. The starships feel too fast but I know Bridge Commander refined what this game tried to do. I really enjoyed being able to play simulations of my favorite episodes/movies like  Balance of Terror  and  The Wrath of Khan  and even the infamous  Kobayashi Maru  scenario. Targeting subsystems was done very well. My main complaint with the simulations is that they do not give you a grade if you pass the mission so I have no idea how well I did (barely passed or aced it) and for a game called Starfleet Academy, grading should be really obvious.   Overall I highly recommend Starfleet Academy to Star Trek fans especially if you are in the mood for starship combat in the TOS era. I would love to see Steam release the expansion  Chekov’s Lost Missions  and  Klingon Academy  next.  ",

            "review_text": "I remember the hype surrounding this game when it came out. In the end i was a little dissapointed with the game mechanics and the graphics. The cut scenes were amazing for the time and really gave you an immersive Star Trek experience.  I've just blasted through it in about 10 hours. Only because I'de played before and knew what I was doing. Some of the missions can be a bit counter intuative. Also the difficulty of the combat can vary wildly. But once you know some tactics (get those pesky birds of prey in a tractor beam) it can be quite easy to beat.  Game works perfectly on w7 64bit, but is exactly as released in 1997, no upgarded graphics etc. Worth buying just to see the orginal actors play their roles again. Lets hope some more classics get optimized. 7/10",

Well 20 yrs + on its still a really solid and enjoyable game thats difficult to complete. Its challenging and fun at the same time and far better than most other ST games - i recommned it",
