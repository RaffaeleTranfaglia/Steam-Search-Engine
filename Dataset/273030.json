            "review_text": "How they could have still got this wrong with the amount of time they have taken is beyond me, including the fact that they had an extremely good manager game in Football Manager to aspire to.  Where do I start? Outdated UI, substitutions don't work, no real control over training or even the match itself, no explanation of what is going on, incorrect player positions and statistics, scrum half won't pass the ball until the defence is readily in position, no offloads, no real depth to the gameplay, game doesn't end after 40/80 minutes, terrible bugs etc...  So disappointed, been looking forward to this for ages. Why can't companies make decent rugby games? I know money and funds can be an issue, but that is no excuse for releasing a terribly buggy and TOTALLY incomplete piece of garbage. I just don't understand how this game has been allowed to release in this state?   Will do everything I can to try and get a refund and let the developers know that they have done a bad job.  This needs SERIOUS patching and VERY soon.  Don't waste your money.",

            "review_text": "This game is Pro Rugby Manager 2005 with the second zero changed to a 1... That's the biggest difference. I'm fairly sure this is the exact same core engine, exact same soundtrack, exact same dialogue and notifications, this is the old game.  The only change is basically the out-of-match GUI.  The old game was great, I loved it. I didn't mind that it was old, and I didn't mind playing Super 15 with unlicenced players or teams. The concept was very good, and anyone who enjoyed it still said a year ago that this would be an amazing game if they went and remade it with modern technology and an updated database.  PRM 2015 is not it. They even removed the unlicenced fake players and teams...  I really support you guys Cyanide. I LOVE Blood Bowl, and PRM 2005 filled a gap for Rugby fans. But this is the most blatant attempt at a quick buck I've ever seen... Please either turn this game around or have some honour and pull the game.",

Many, many, many more problems but I do not have the time go into. DO NOT BUY.",
