I got it as part of an indy royale package and it's amusing for a few hours and that's about all the 10 or so different levels can offer the average gamer, if that.  Hard to recommend for anything more than 1 dollar.",

            "review_text": "I would only suggest this game to people who like downtempo music. The gameplay is extremely slow until the very last 2-3 levels, and I pretty much passed every level on my first or second try. There's not that many stages at all, and there's pretty much no variation besides more dumb powerups that troll the hell out of you as you move along the game, but I can't really complain since I got this game for less than $2.  Since the game has a horrible description, basically all you do is match sequences of colors and blow them up (your only buttons are mouse1 and mouse2), and basically gray coloured blocks are wildcards so you can match a lot of different chains! Wow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  The music is slow to the point where it wants to force you to go to sleep, although I guess if you enjoy minimalist downtempo music, then you would love to play this game.  WOULD HIGHLY SUGGEST WATCHING A GAMEPLAY VIDEO BEFORE BUYING, EVEN IF YOU ENJOY DOWNTEMPO MUSIC, BECAUSE THE GAMEPLAY IS NONEXISTANT  Also if you're an achievement ♥♥♥♥♥ like me, you won't enjoy this game because none of the achievements are hard to get besides the last two, because it forces you to play the game even after you've beaten it. In my opinion, I got what I paid for, although it wasn't fun at all for me to play through it.  I beat this game under an hour for a glimpse at how long you can play this for~",

Mostly it ends up feeling kind of frustrating and not all that much fun trying to string together combos out of things while trying to even keep track of what's going on in the first place. If the learning curve consisted of more than 'beat your head against this until you get the hang of it' it might be more accessible, or if the feedback for what you're doing were better and didn't get lost in the clutter of everything else that's going on it might help, but as it is I'm glad it was free.",
