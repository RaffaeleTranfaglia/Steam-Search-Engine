There are far better versions of this game available for free and playable in your browser.  Aside from not being a very good clone of Angry Birds there are major issues such as the screen not keeping up with the rocks you fire, so you can't even see where they are landing properly.  A total waste of money and time.",

Must be the loading screen.  Wait... It's not. This is the main menu.  Where are the buttons?  Figure it out, because it's too hard to add in letters into the game or a real menu.  This game shouldn't be $0.99. It should be 10 cents, or free. Even the free games aren't as bad as this game.",
