I will say that the controls could be a little tighter in certain puzzles, but I'm excited for the content the developers will add. Adding extra lanterns in multiplayer would be nice, some rooms are really dark even with lamps on.  7/10 - Nicely renovated from original escape room games. Awesome in multiplayer.",

Episode 2 and 3 did not follow episode 1 in quality, unfortunately, and with the numerous bugs and generally repetitive/easy puzzles it has since lost its initial allure. Will probably play it to completion since I already own it though..... With time, when bugs have been sorted, and rooms are filled out, this game may improve but for now it's descended into meh.",
