            "review_text": "Although I liked the other VNs I've read from Dharker Studios, I can't really recommend this one. It's just the stub of a story, more like a rough sketch than a finished product. It's maybe the first chapter of a game yet to come (and as that, the story has NO conclusion at all).  The voiceovers are a nice change from the usual text only captions in this genre, but the art looks like someone simply filled in some colour to rough sketches. The Steam thumbnail is by far the most professional the art ever gets, the rest, meaning every single image in the game, sadly is on a much more amateurish or very unfinished level.  I would have no issues with this if Dharker Studios had released this as a free demo, but as it is they are charging money (however little) for something that is in no way a finished product.  If this is being turned into a finished VN, I might actually like it, but in the state it's in now, I sadly can't recommend it at all.",

            "review_text": "This little visual novel tells two stories. In the first of them we make choices that lead us to different endings. In the second we delve into the story with one possible way of completion. Both stories show the dark side of the world. Drawings and soundtrack seem fine. Unfortunately, reading time or actually the listening (voice actors talk very smoothly and pleasantly for the ear) is quite short and takes about an hour. The price is not excessive and you can always still wait for a good sale.",

            "review_text": "First off you have to know this is not a Game but a graphic novel and it's not a Hentai Game. You won't experience any real gameplay or real nudity but instead click through text boxes.  First off a positive aspect of this 'game' is the very good voice acting which is brilliantly done for both characters Shizume und Keiji.  But: the game or the novel is very short, in Shizume's story there are like 3 decisions to make which influence the story; by influence I mean if you pick the wrong thing Shizume will die and the story ends, wich means u play it once (for 10 minutes until you're through it) and that's it, no need to replay this ever again. The story is not that interesting either und if you expect some Henati stuff you'll definitly be dissapaointed (just like I was) no nudity in this bro, just some minor boobage (in Shizume's Story of course).  In Keiji's story there isn't even a decision to make, you just click through this very confusing story until it ends (after about 5 minutes).  The music in this game is quite nice but it's just one short Track which repeats and it can get annoying.  I really did not like the artstyle of this game. Dhakrer Studios has done much better looking 'games'; this looks more like a School Project from an Art Studient who's into some Anime but learned drawing it through cheep 'How to draw Manga and Anime Characters' Books.  I cannot recommend this game because it looks dull, has no real gameplay and the story isn't interesting enough to make that up and it's short as hell.  I know it's a cheap buy, but don't waste your time on this. Dharker Studios has made better Games of this type like for example 'Club Life', you should get this instead of this boring and cheap looking graphic novel.",
