            "review_text": "This is bad game. You are basically a survivor in a zombie arena, trying to run around and kill waves of increasingly more powerful zombies, crawlers and spiders. At the end of the round, you are given 1 credit to regain 1 of 4 things. These are Thirst, Hunger, Ammo and Health. During the game, if you run out of any of these things, you are going to lose. You move around using the Right Mouse Click and attack/shoot with Left Mouse Click. Press E to open up racks and Spacebar to use your special power. Q is for the map but it's redundant since the map is so small.   I played till level 5 but I do not recommend that you play this game at all.   PROS  1. It didn't crash It could run at least.   CONS  1. All the Zombie models are crap The zombie models just differ in the colour of the burnt skin and come in different sizes. The Arachno zombie was just a normal zombie with spiders for shoes.  2. Movement is horrible Using the Right Mouse Button to move is extremely bad. This is not a Real Time Strategy game.  3. Low Player Population  Seriously, no servers found.  4. Gameplay is so boring It's just not fun at all. You run around and shoot zombies but the way it's done is bad. It's far worse compared to other zombie games like Call of Duty : Black Ops.",

The controls suck! big time, you've to use the mouse to move around dodging zombies and aim correctly so that one shot in 3 second you get hits most of them. I mean what the hell man... Disappointment at its best.",

            "review_text": "  Well, the developer sure tried. But, it's no good game. First, getting the game to run on Linux is a hassle, as it expects a specific non-standard resolution (1366x768) to even get past the first screen, or else nothing is clickable (and yes, that's in the native version, no Wine or anything else). Second, the graphics and sound are very generic. They both seem to be stock models and sounds (and even music), but they're sewn together fittingly, so it's no big pain, but still... Third, after playing for 5 minutes, you have seen everything the game has to offer. It only gets harder and faster, but nothing new happens. And last, the developer has already abandoned the game and won't even say so himself. Only acquaintances of him telling people in the forum who ask questions that he has 'RL issues' and won't look after the game anymore.  So, if you want to spend a dollar or two to get some trading cards, this game is ok for you. Otherwise, better buy something else.",
