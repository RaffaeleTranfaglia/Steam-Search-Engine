            "review_text": "Very bad game.  No real mechanics. You line the shot up, You pull the mouse back to how hard you want to hit ball...once you are happy, you click your mouse to actually hit it. There's no type of swing mechanic, no 3 click golf type mechanic or anything else...tahts it. You say how hard you want to hit it on their gauge, you line it up with mouse, then you click to let the game proceed.  On top of that, the rebound mechanics seem horribly off. Basically one shot I hit towards a wall at an angle, and instead of travelling off the angle in the other direction like it's suppose to, it came back to me as if i hit it straight on at the wall instead. Also, some walls seemed to be sticky or something, the ball would hit it, and slide along it instead of bouncing back.  A very poor attempt, glad I got this in a bundle.",
