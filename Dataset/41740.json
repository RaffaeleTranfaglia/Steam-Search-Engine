Don't get me wrong, there's legitimate fun to be had here; the gameplay is basically just building custom vehicles to solve tasks (Think a simpler spiritual-predecessor to Besiege. Or Banjo Kazooey Nuts and Bolts' except that no one's beloved franchise was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ized in the making of Cargo!) and I genuinely found it fun to drive around the vehicles I had built or go out of my way to find the least-obvious way to accomplish my tasks..  But the game world and the characters populating it are WEIRD, like something from a dream when you've eaten a whole pizza before bed. I'm talking island gods consisting of giant mechanical masks on rails, and dancing, naked, man-faced babies that explode into fireworks if you cause them to have 'too much fun'.  (and weird is a good thing)",

            "review_text": "This game felt like it had potential, up until the point where it utterly sucked. Which was the first 2 minutes of the game. You crash land on an island filled with masked gods (Which have the longest, most annoying, and out of context conversations) and small man babies that you can kick around the island for some kind of point system. The objective of the game is to rechieve enough pieces from your blimp to rebuild it and fly off the god for sacken island. From what the trailer and images showed is that it is a sandbox adventure game in which you can create various aircrafts and boats to do various tasks with. But from the gameplay it shows that you have to pay in game currency for parts of the ships and it took me the two hours of playing this game to figure out how to activate the building sequence. Horrific voice acting, terrible and slow gameplay, and aweful game mechanics. Not even worth the two dollars I paid for this piece of crap on a Steam sale. -100000000/10",

You walk around kicking tiny, naked, genital-less midgets in their very round asses to gain 'fun' while a couple of schitzo masks insult you.  The point of the game is that Earth has lost gravity, only these midgets still exist, and you can restore mass by collecting fun from the midgets. Their idea of fun is getting kicked around, jumping into high speed fans and getting pulverized, etc.   If you like games that make almost no sense in our world, are kind of confusing even in their world, and is based on immature and sometimes inappropriate humor, then yes I recommend it.  If you value your time and money, no.",

THE GAME IS JUST TERRIBLE...  I have played the game in 0.3 hours and found out all of this, imagine what you find out on 4 hours (which is the estimated story-time of this game).  BTW: it's buggy  ps. don't buy this game unless you are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or rich, I won this game on steamgifts, and I want my points back!!!!",
