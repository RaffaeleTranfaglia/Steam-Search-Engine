            "review_text": "This is a really good VR experience, and it's pretty cool that it's free.   Scratch that, it's fantastic that it's free.  It's a very linear experience, bringing you into a human cell, through some arteries, etc. The visuals are great and the narration is really good as well.   There's also a cool side mode where you can view different bodily systems, break them up into specific parts, and see their names and such.  Did I mention this is free?  If you're at all interested in biology, and would like to see a brief explanation of the inner workings of the body, you can't go wrong with this one.  Definitely worth the download.",

            "review_text": "Absolutely mindblowingly great experience. There is a human anatomy section, where you can look at a lifesize model of the different systems in the human body. My favourite was the muscular system. You can press the explode button and all the muscles fan out in fromt of you so you can see each one, then you can pick them up individually move them around freely, its amazing. If you go through the main part (6mins) and the anatomy part, there is probably only 15 - 20 mins of content. But it is awesome and great to show people who aren't into games as much. I hope they continue to update and add content because I really want to see more. When the only problem with an app is that there is not enough of it, you know its good. Inspiring, educational and trippy!",
