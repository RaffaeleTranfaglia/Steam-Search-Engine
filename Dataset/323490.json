            "review_text": "I was able to clear one route for Dyanna, Lin, and Finn; three routes for Leira. From this, I do think that a lot of things are lost in translation because of cultural barriers, and to make matters worse the translation is quite terrible; as I read in the forums the translation is now being reviewed.  Oblivious Garden ~Carmina Burana is pretty much similar to other VN's, you move around the garden and go to places where you can interact with its characters. Your decisions will direct which storyline you will go through. In some stages of the game you will be asked to prepare a tea, this will lead you to a minigame. You'll decide which ingridients to use, set the temperature and time for brewing. The game may end early if you somehow suddenly got kicked out of the garden (This was how my first game ended). If you were able to do you job well you may be able to proceed to one of the heroine routes.  I had a hard time understanding it but the story is really good and interesting. The protagonist was presented well, and some of the characters are pretty unpredictable that you'd be puzzled out on how to interact with them.  It was a joy listening to the voice acting, there was nothing that I didn't like (This is my first Chinese VN though; I can't understand what they were saying). I like the art and the soundtrack. The OP is what I like the most in this game, I don't know how many times I watched it, really loved the music.  If you ever find yourself playing this VN, I recommend that you start trying to get to Finn's route first, finish Lin and Leira's before going on to Dyanna. I believe that this is the best way to experience the VN because with this you can have a finale with the Miracle Play.",

            "review_text": "The plot in this is really good. I've only done Finn's story so far, and it moved me to tears. The characters are all very complex and I really liked the Chinese voice overs. The protagonist is the best of any VN I've played. I'm not sure I'll ever be able to complete the stories for the other people in that garden... I wouldn't be able to choose any of them over Finn.  Oblivious Garden is well worth its price. Artwork is quality, music is good, English translation has the occasional hiccup although it was never bad - the occasional 'your' being used instead of 'you're' or an odd grammatical error.  Please developers, make a sequel! Please! I need to know   that Finn's ok  !",

This is worth the buy! :3  (Plus leira accidently gets cute bunny ears! so kawaii) ",

I've play a lot of VN games, this game is one of the games that gives me unique feeling (I don't know how to describe it, It just give off a different feeling ,a good one of course.).  I'll just get to the point.  I love the story. I really like it when it reveals more and more truth about the characters and the background story as I play each route. Although there're some parts that confused me but it's still pretty good though. Well. I'll have to admit that I was somehow confused by the fast pace of the story &gt;&gt;&gt; especially Finn's route. But maybe I'm just not adjusted to it.( I'm the type that enjoy slow-pace game like Fate.)   And the translation. It would be really good if you fix it, some parts are too confusing and it's annoying. I suggest you fix it. This game will be much more perfect if you do so.  The artworks and the music are marvelous, really. The music is... I don't know how to describe - it suits the atmosphere of the story Maybe it's what that make the atmosphere of the story) Rich and beautiful, that's it. I think I'll buy the soundtrack after I have collect some more money :3.  I give this game 8/10.   I'll be waiting for the sequal ;3 .",
