Good graphic, decent mechanics (using card system to deploy tower and it has even magic and talent trees) but the game is not even supported. You'll see your screen freezes every random seconds. Some can mitigate the effect by blocking the game's exe in Windows firewall to stop sending handshakes to external servers.   And the servers... are dead. Leaderboards? Bye bye.  More so, not only have the developers terminated the support without warning, leaving paying players on Steam to see the free counterpart on other websites updated continously is just daylight insult.  Fool me once, shame on me. Fool me twice, shame on this horrible business practice (they had the guts to promote their mobile games on this game's Store Page when abandoning the game).  You'd be better off playing TD like Sanctum or the legendary Defense Grid series.",

            "review_text": "Lets start of by saying that i havent played a lot of tower defence games but if a fair few have the quality that this game does then i think i will be playing a fair few others. When i started playing the game i was like 'I really like the setting' (huge fantasy fan me) 'but do i really like the style of gameplay that this sort of game has'. Then i watched as time went by and i realised this is exactally the sort of game i love to spend time with,the setting is pure fantasy and is well represented in game with the graphics,sound and script. The game plays out from battle to battle and you gain coin and different cards that you can use in battles defending the entrance that the demons (from bouncing heads on sticks to exploding frogs-GO FIGURE) try to reach and if they do so in a certain number then its 'GAME OVER MAN' (couldent resisit the quote there). The cards are also used in between levels in upgrading the towers you have,and beleive me when i tell you that this plays a heavy part in the game as dont upgrade and you are not going to proceed any further than where you are at that certain point in the game.Grinding plays quite a huge role in the game and is an important part of being able to upgrade the equipment you have so you can get that one level closer to the finishing line and the demon who seems to want your head on a pole. Like i have allready said i really liked the game and after playing for a while (havent quite finished just yet-but dont think it will change my opinion on the game as i will still regard it as a game i would reccommend to anyone with a love of tower defence games) then decided to buy another tower defence game (well the pack) ANOMOLY 2 and found that i really like that game also. So sometimes it is good to play games you arent used to as you then find that sometimes a change can be just what you needed and that a game style you have never played before can get you gaming in ways you never thought you would.",

You might think that sounds like a good thing but what is left is a confused and horribly unbalanced game.  I spent my first 8 or 9 hours breezing through the game at a steady pace before hitting a brick wall of challenge which is insurmountable without resorting to endless grinding. Your towers come in the form of cards. You need to collect several of the same cards to upgrade them and progress however the only way of obtaining cards is by finding them at random or by purchasing them with in-game credits. You can't choose which ones you buy with your credits though, that is also left to chance. You'll soon run out of credits though and In a freemium game you would be able to purchase in-game credits to top up if you wanted, in this game however, the only way to earn credits is by grinding. Grinding can often be fun in a game, here it is so ineffective that it feels like an utterly pointless endeavour. You grind away hoping to be rewarded with the cards you need to upgrade and progress yet all the end of level rewards feel about 3 levels behind where you need them to be, meaning the cards you want, the cards you NEED, rarely come up. By the time you've fully upgraded a few towers the game ramps up the difficulty and they are rendered ineffective. You need to upgrade the new towers. Your magic abilities are absolutely useless, the fuse and evolution function is over complicated and there are frankly just too many towers with too many different enemies with the same levels rehashed over and over. It's a mess to be honest and the in-game currency, leveling up system along with the grinding nature of the gameplay and 'daily rewards' and 'special offer's' on items all scream freemium. Yet this isn't a freemium game, so it's all a bit redundant.   All in all then Prime World Defenders' as a game is basically thus: Want to obtain more towers? Grind. Want to unlock new abilities? Grind. Want to upgrade your towers so you can beat the level and progress? GRIND. Just don't expect grinding to get you anywhere.",

Prime World: Defenders is fun, especially if you like tower defense games (TD). The UI is near enough to perfect that it should be standard to TD games the same way that WASD is standard to FPS games. Yup, its that good! The gameplay mechanics are pretty standard, the baddies come marching in, dumb and happy to a horrible end, killed by bog standard towers. Oh well, you don't fix what ain't broke!  The innovation appears in the form of a random collectable card mechanic where you get random cards as loot for beating a map, which are towers, artifacts, or magic. You can combine two of the same to evolve it, allowing towers to be upgraded or you can fuse multiple cards into one to increase its level, making it more powerful. Its more complicated than I'm explaining it, and its very satisfying. My only beef is with the voice acting, which is awful, but skippable.  Now go away, I'm gonna play some more!",

I hate games where you are given a bunch of options, but to win you have to chose a particular one. Never felt this was one of those games.   You eventually will have to grind, but i found it an enjoyable grinding never felt repetitive. Mainly because, while 'grinding' you can beat one mission you already passed trying new cards/spells you earned. It's like you are grinding but at the same time, you are training and experimenting the best ways to beat the upcoming levels. You get the feel that you are always progressing, which i appreciate a lot.  The card evolution/fusing system it's also very interesting, and adds a lot to the game. The visuals and voice acting are also enjoyable, not great, but they do their job decently.",

Only once (to get a full dragon tower) did it feel like a slog.  Anyways, it's a fun tower defense game. The story is... well, not great. The voice acting could use some work, but at least the art direction is pretty good. There was a relatively decent selection of maps, and each time it's slightly randomized to add a bit of replayability.

Yes, there is a lot of grinding to do and I am not that far into it, so I am not going to really review the game yet. Just know that I play a lot of Tower Defense (TD ) games and so far Prime World: Defenders is one of my favorite. The 3D graphics are superb, the gameplay is fun, but might be a bit grindy for some people, the sound is great with excellent music. Every thing else is done right and very colorful! All the menus are pleasing to the eye and the world map is awesome! The choice of creatures is the best feature and they are all rendered in stunning 3D!!! The towers and animations look great! The list goes on and on...  The only negative thing that I found was that you can only grind the maps so many times before you stop getting silver and experience points for beating them. Then you have to move along to the next map and grind that map to it's max times. I think you can grind each map around 10 times or so. I haven't counted, but it's enough to get some of your perks leveled up. The cards really only represent the towers and do not come into play during combat like the card game Magic. You will stack them to level your towers and magic, so to speak. There are special cards to find and add to your towers too. This is all done outside of combat. Combat is your typical tower defense setup, but leveling towers happens outside of combat. Makes sense and is pretty cool! :-)  The game is a little hard, but easier than some of the other TD games I've played. I'll have to play some more and then come back and review it. I do like it a lot so far. The game is solid and has not crashed on me yet.

I've played the game enitirely in off-line mode, so I can't speak to any Steam-related issues or capacities.]  I'm a big-fan of the tower-defense genre, and have been playing them from way back in the Warcraft 3 modding-days, when there were dozens available, and many had very innovative concepts. Prime World: Defenders does a great job at incorporating many different Tower Defence elements into one game, in a way that is mostly smooth and satisfying.   I'll highlight those positive tower-defence elements in this review: -Levels are loseable, due to failed strategy, random difficulty changes, or not having leveled up enough. This makes winning more rewarding, and the game more depthful. -Many towers are availble in the game, and you get to select up to 7 of them for each battle, making your strategy personal and adaptable. -You can use spells in addition to towers to add an extra layer of strategy and the need for awareness. -You can 'rush' the next wave of enemies for a bonus of money to build your towers. This adds both more strategy, and an ability to get in over your head. -There is a leveling up system for your towers and spells, which adds elements of both luck and personalization to your resources. -There are a modest variety of monsters, and while I wouldn't mind more, each type has strengths and weaknesses and the balance works well for the game. -Ability to replay levels, either for resource farming, or to improve scores/records and secondary objectives. -Each time you play a level, the map is generated to have differences in the tiles. A tile could be open, boosted, or blocked. This significantly changes the strategy and difficulty of the level. The type of monsters, and the order of waves also changes/  Also positive: I find the graphics to be both attractive, and more importantly, clear- I can tell what is going on with the battle at a glance. There is a story, which while not particularly incredible so far, takes place in an imaginative world.   The negatives are as follows: -Sometimes you end up having to grind in order to buildup the resources you need to develop your towers and be able to move forward. -Maps are reused frequently in the beginning, and while there are changes to both the map tiles and monsters, it grows tiring to keep replaying he same maps if you choose to grind early on. -Sometimes the display radius of a tower does not display properly, or does not seem to match up with the tower's ability to hit monsters. -The tower and spell-leveling systems are very simple, but poorly explained. I was very confused in the beginning, and there are still some nuances regarding cost that I have not worked out. -The 'percent efficiency boost' that notifies you what leveling up a tower or spell does is sometimes innaccurate.  Overall I feel this game is a solid investment for fans of the genre. I think it is depthful and strategic, and brings in a lot of nuance and a fair amount of challenge. The downside is that you may spend significant time grinding instead of moving forward, so the game might be a poor choice for people who want to play and beat a game, quick and simple.",

My girlfriend watched me play for three hours straight the night I bought it. The next day I picked it up for her too because she had so much fun just watching/helping me play. Couldn't be happier with this game!",

            "review_text": "Very interesting CCG TD combo which is good fun to play and offers a fair amount of strategy and variation BUT there is a lot of grinding involved - a LOT. You cannot complete the game without grinding for at least 5 - 10 hours because you won't have the good towers yet and/or your towers will simply be too weak.  If you don't like spending hours grinding away then I would recommend you play as far as you can until you hit a grind point then take a break and come back every now and then. This way it doesn't feel like a chore and you can keep your entertainment levels up. I took two weeks to finish this and I enjoyed my time doing so. If you do enjoy grinding then you'll love this game.  TIP: As soon as you see any purple catds, grab them. They are far better than the other cards, especially once evolved and fused to max. ",
