            "review_text": "This is a surprisingly intense game that requires a lot of precision and timing, I found myself poised and ready to pounce on each opportunity to move. Getting used to the turning took me a while, and most of my deaths were from me straight barreling into the red zones by the tiniest fraction (it almost feels as though the hitbox is octagonal rather than circular, and slightly larger tahn the sprite- slightly).  I love how the level designs discouraged me from getting too impatient, and that impending sense of doom as I realized that I'd just jumped over a barrier which turned around and began bearing down on me- augmented by my panicked use of the slowing power was just /delicious/. Every time I caught myself thinking 'Well at least X isn't happening', X happened.  I didn't quite make it to the end, as after about an hour I finally saw a level that I just 'noped' right out of, but I intend to go back and finish it after this adrenaline rush peters out- heck, I may even start from scratch. After all, I just so love suffering.  13/10 would panic and run into a stationary kill-wall again.  Bonus points for the great soundtrack.",
