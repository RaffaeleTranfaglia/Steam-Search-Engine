            "review_text": "Mixed feelings about this game that LOOKS casual but is anything but.   Pro:   - Good looks - Plays nicely. No complaints on the UI.   Con:  - This game is NOT a casual game even though it looks like it. Difficulty is surprisingly high and you must employ all the tricks you know on how to extend those combos. It is not unusual to decide the end result on the very last card using everything you got. Wild cards are really important in this game.  - Replaying hands because thats what it will eventually go to. RInse and repeat.   Now i like Legends of Solitaire and Faerie Solitaire in which i could beat all challenges relatively easily but this game is much harder. The Casual element is gone - this is some serious work if you want to get ahead in this game once you start getting closer to half-way on the map and i am not sure i like this design - conversely f you turn it around some people will think this is the best game precisely because it challenges you.   So pick which one you like, casual entertainment or a more serious solitaire challenge and buy accordingly.",
