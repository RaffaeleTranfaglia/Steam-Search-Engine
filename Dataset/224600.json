            "review_text": "I cannot recommend this game in good conscience to anyone. There are broken promises abound, incredibly poor quality updates, and a fundamental lack of understanding at both developer and management level about the game. Between cheating in PvP not being addressed, the shallow content updates, delayed update schedule, and fumblings of even the most basic systems... the game just does not have much going for it.  I have hundreds of hours logged into the game because of the old PvP community that has since disappeared. The final straw for me was when 100% damage mitigation was declared a legitimate tactic by the development team, even though it was abusing a very obscure game bug to achieve it.  Some other issues with the game, as I perceive them:  PvE Content: Overall you are looking at maybe 10-20 hours of story quests, maybe 5-10 hours of races and challenges, and perhaps 5-10 hours of instances.  * The main story isn't too bad - mostly your standard MMOG quests. There's some interesting ones here and there, but overall it's an average experience. The final boss fight was actually mildly engaging, but that's probably the only difficulty people will ever face with the game. * Instanced dungeons were fun, but the game encourages repetitious grinding of them. This leads to the limited amount of them becoming stale in short order. * Challenges can be fun, they're probably one of the more enjoyable pieces of content in the game.  PvP Content: Used to be okay, now completely intolerable. Due to a damage resistance bug, specific players have an unfair advantage the developers have said they are unwilling to stop. Therefore, players are not on even footing.  * PvP queues were altered to allow Shadow Wars ('open world' PvP) to start faster. This had the consequence of making the instanced PvP maps completely dead, they do not start anymore. * Shadow Wars take place in the open world, which was not designed for PvP. There's a serious lack of cover, dull terrain and paths, poor objective spacing, and are just overwhelmingly disappointing. * The first DLC update came with a new PvP map, which has serious graphical glitches (lighting breaks and makes your screen black), invisible walls that look passable, and a few other issues. Since that map never has enough people in queue, it was never fixed.  Updates: Overall very slow to come out due to console restrictions, and sparse on fixes or changes. DLC is slow, vaguely outlined, and often fails to deliver your money's worth in content.  * The 'Season Pass' was supposed to be a one-year, 5 DLC package. As of the time of this review (November 25), only one has been released since April. There is no way all five will come out in a year's time. * The only DLC released was abysmally poor in both quality and quantity. The paid update was supposed to be a multiplayer horde-style arena, but was turned into a 5-wave single player instance. The leaderboards are bugged and constantly reset, making competition pointless. A truck with a mounted turret was scrapped due to technical limitations. * There's a fundamental lack of understanding of how the game works at the developer level. Patches often come in that do not address player concerns, but do the complete opposite of what is requested. * Weapons like the FRC SAW were nerfed due to AI not pressuring players enough, making them the leading weapon for PvE content completion. They were marginal in PvP, and became useless post-patch.  Verdict: The game has a great third person shooter mechanics, and that's about all it has going for it. Content is sparse and shallow, with updates not adding enough to sustain interest. Developers seem disinterested and not engaged with what the community wants, which leads to very poor content updates. The PvP is no longer competitive, due to the bugs being abused and general lack of care on the studio's part.  I would not recommend purchasing Defiance. If you do decide to buy it against this advice, then I would highly recommend avoiding the Season Pass.  If you have any questions about my experience with the game, my review, or anything related, please feel free to leave a comment. I'm happy to discuss anything at all.",

            "review_text": "A great game until your reach the point of the experience cap, not the level cap. This means that until you reach the experience cap you can play the game as you like and enjoy the game on your terms. You can use the weapons you like and play the events in game that you enjoy.   Once you hit the experience cap however the game turns into a major boring grind. In order to advance yourself to the level cap you will be required to complete pursuits (specific goals in order to obtain part of a level). This quickly becomes monotonous as you no longer are playing the game on your terms, you are not doing things you enjoy as you already completed all the pursuits from the things you enjoyed on your way to the experience cap.  In my opinion this is a terrible game design. Players should not be forced to do races, pvp, hunt for data recorders etc... to advance their progression if that's not what excited them to play the game to begin with. If you are someone who does not like pvp why should you be forced to do pvp events just so you can reach the level cap? If you are a pvp lover why would you want to spend weeks running around looking for data recorders just so your character can progress?  To summarize, this game is wonderful while you are able to play it how you like and progress your character doing things you enjoy. once you have reached the experience cap it quickly becomes a chore and monotonous to a large degree as the grind to reach the level cap is made up of tasks you avoided along the way. I cannot recommend the game to people as I believe that games should be fun from beginning to end, not just the first half.",

            "review_text": "The game had a very rough launch with bugs, Hence the low rating for the game by Meta. But those bugs are all but squashed now and the game is really solid.   It's like a mix of swtor, and borderlands 2. The way the area's are created has a Swtor feel, and your running around shootings things much like Borderlands, or so I hear. (I never actually played either Borderlands, but that's how people are describing it).   With only a few hours of game-play in it, I'm already getting my 10$ worth out of it easy, and the game story will draw you in. The characters personalities seem pretty solid as well, you'll hate them, love them, and get annoyed by the ones your supposed too.   Ontop of that, the customization for your character is pretty legit as well, not only being able to choose which weapon and side arm you want, (which is no limitations, you could go sniper rifle/Assault Weapon Sniper Rifle/Bazooka, Pistol/Energy Gun, or even Shotgun/Shotgun) No limitations in mix and matching weapons.   Just like Swtor you can break down your weapons as well for parts and income, or add accessories and mods to them which will boost their ability, as well as change your characters headgear, and outfit to mix and match.   Definetly worth the 10$ easy.  Cons:   The few Con's I found are not huge, but could be a turn off for some players.   1) The starting area's at least are pretty empty. To me this actually enhances the feel of it being a wasteland. If there were 100's of people running around, wouldn't feel like that, so to me this is actually a plus, but for others may be a turn off. There is a helpful automatic party finder however, which helps to get groups.   2) The Chat system is totally implimented bad. You can never see what anyone is saying around you or in the area. To see it, you have to stop what your doing and press Enter. Which then a Chat screen the size of the entire screen pops up. Which only then can you respond. Terrible chat system for an action game, because half way through responding to what your friend just said your getting shot at, and need to stop.   However if you use VOIP to talk with friends, again, the chat system is of no concern for you really.",

There were tremendous glitches with the released game that were reported but never fixed from the alpha and beta test. Then there was the numerous accounts of cheating. Trions fix was to weaken each weapon as it was constantly used for that. They really should have never had client side calcualations for these things to begin with. That makes it just too easy to send altered data instead of the real stuff.  Then every time they fixed something they broke 2 others......and often didn't even fix what they released a patch to fix. I don't even want to hear the term Freight Yard ever again. I can't count the number of times they re-released it as fixed only to remove it again because they didn't fix it correctly.  After that is the constant number of times the first DLC was delayed. Not to mention the ambiguous remarks of content to come. You can't promote something by simply saying 'it's something big' or 'look forward to it'. Give actual details. For storyline there were constant contradictions with it's side to side TV series.  In all this game relied too much on the TV series. I truly don't expect this game to fare too well for an extended period longer.",

            "review_text": "Defiance feels like a Fallout and Borderlands mashup in a very good way. Gunplay is solid and you get the expected amount of MMORPG stats and grinding.  Where it falls short is in the showstopping bugs and lag. As of 5 September 2014 main missions required to progress through the campaign are simply broken. On my first character I got stuck approximately two dozen missions in. On my second character the second main quest completely broke rendering me unable to obtain the first vehicle or progress the campaign. Humping it on foot to do side quests isn't particularly pleasant.  Checkpoints don't trigger, things don't spawn, and general 'Huh? What's supposed to happen?' moments, at least for newbies, abound. Time trial route points don't show (or take too long to appear) making it pointless to try, and you'll desync from the server a lot, requiring logouts which sometimes work for a while before needing them again.  One might point out that of course MMOs can and always do have network issues, but a quick perusal of the official forums indicates that these same issues have been ongoing since at least mid-2013. It's a shame that I can't really recommend Defiance based almost completely on technical issues. I do hope they iron out the problems eventually.",

Complete missions to get small bits of story. Do secondary missions to grind RNG drops for decent gear. The co-op gameplay isn't bad, but even then there aren't a lot of them, even after all the expansions Trion has made for the game.  I can't comment on the PvP, it might be worth it if that's your thing. But, I never cared a lot for PvP in MMORPG's.",

As it stands today, this game is for you if you enjoy doing the same thing over and over. If you like to feel like the gun you are using is really a pea shooter. If your idea of DLC is the same content played in reverse, the same content with more bad guys, the same content in the form of an arena, the same content in a different area, then this is probably the game for you. Even better is that they can't make that same content play correctly most of the time.   I'd still recommend playing this game if you enjoyed the show.

            "review_text": "I would not reccommend this game as a long term form of entertainment. The storyline is trash. So incredibly bland and uninteresting. You dont benefit at all from playing the storyline missions, either. There is no incentive to do the missions because you get really crappy weapons. Once you get a few good weps, you pretty much learn to ignore everything else.   The gameplay is pretty robust, but the missions are extremely repetitive. All you do is kill enemies (all of them) or go interact with objects in order to complete missions. Playing with friends makes it fun, but there doesnt seem to be a clear method of actually doing missions together. You can form groups and clans but there isn't much explanation on how to do other group activities.   The most fun events were the Arkfalls becasue they were so chaotic and so many people were playing at once ( easily 60-80 players at once, with little lag!!). However, there is not much variation with them. They are all pretty much the same.   PvP was put together as an afterthought, it seems. They realized they could re-use all their previously build mechanics and only have to make a few extra TDM and CP maps. Its really not that fun, unfortunately. The Shadow War looked cool, as it allows a 64 vs 64 open world match. Unfortunately, I've never played with more than 20 people at once. The co-op is also very bland.  The interface of the game is pretty much ported from a console. Buttons look like list items and things that are supposed to be clickable dont look like i can click them.The chat is a joke because a.) nobody really uses it and b.) as a 3rd person shooter, you are shooting and playing the game looking at your crosshair and enemies most of the time. People were trying to get my attention in game and I had no idea because the chat window was completely hidden except for a transparent blue bar. I messed up some missions because I didn't know people were talking to me. Really got under my skin.  Anyway, it actually has a better feel on a console. I played it on PS3 too.  It seems really cool at first. You're gonna love it at first. Play it for a little while and learn how things work before you drop money.",

Thee shalt pay much of thine coin!' in this review, then you have not played this game. In my experience, it is a great game, with some okay potential, although this has gone downhill fast. with shallow storylines, uninteresting characters, and an underwhelming 'Silicon Valley' update (be aware that that was Trion's BIGGEST UPDATE YET), this is not a game to invest money in.  ALTHOUGH! The lore and world, combined with plentiful serious moments make up for all of this. It is an open-world MMORPG. You can always skip the main questline and do what you wish. It can be your own story, with a little grinding. Try to make up a story in your head, and ask for RPers in the Chatbox. You won't regret it, and it can be loads of fun.  ALTHOUGH! (again) I did not do this. I feel the main storyline is lacking. The only good characters in the beginning easily lose their influence later on. The bad ones, like Cass Ducar, get better toward San Francisco, so just bear in mind that opinion. The show does nothing to complement the story at all. So, I recommend you experience them as seperate franchises.  (And the show becomes a bit of a soap opera, so the game is still better.)  I believe that Trion has lost it's footing completely. They can only keep this game due to a vast amount of product placement by Dodge. SERIOUSLY, WHY THE HECK IS DODGE SO IMPORTANT IN THIS MULTI-FACTION CRISIS? HECK, EVEN THE 'MARK OF THE DEFIANT' IS THE DODGE LOGO!  Excuse my rant, but Trion is putting a minimal amount of work into this game. The DLCs are pretty much just a few new vendors. (Excluding Gunslinger Trials, Castithian Charge, and Arkbreaker) You will like it for a while, but I recommend other games for long-term. It functions best as an F2P game.  The weapon mechanics can be summed up in one quote. DEATH TO ALL PLAYERS -Trion Worlds. You can shoot an enemy in the face 20 times, leaving him with 60% health. Mind = blown. There are no people who do PvE anymore, so you pretty much solo everything. All the enemies have bulletproof faces, so you have to do them one at a time with five other enemies firing at you. The weapons are all horrible. An assault rifle 4 levels below an LMG still does more damage. The tolerable weapons have little ammo, so you need to constantly reload and backtrack 200m just to grab some ammo.   All in all, this game is a great challenge to skilled gamers such as myself and everyone that can stand this game. There are really no reasons to keep playing other than that.

            "review_text": "Smooth and sweet! I have to admit. I was EXCEPTIONALLY skeptical of this game and tried the free trial thinking I would hate it, and end up uninstalling it. I had just uninstalled Neverwinter, a title run by the same company that made another mmorpg. They used allot of elements in their first mmorpg (Star Trek) in Neverwinter and it felt so bad and horribly cloned I could not stand it. In TRION's Defiance, I was very worried I would be playing RIFT like character models. However, it was NOT the case. I was very surprised at how smooth the character was moving around and how engaging the story was. There are cutscenes and an over all story arc that pulls you into the world and makes it feel living. There is an opening cutscene very egaging and interesting to watch. It ties in fluidly to introduce your character and put you right into the mmorpg open world. This is a hard concept most developers CANNOT pull off. If you read my Neverwinter review, you would see how I was so dissapointed that the game has a great system of cinematics mixed with in game gameplay for the first 5 levels, then abruptly cuts off and leaves you with rinse and repeat quest hubs and over all compelling story. In fact, most games are like this. Or you do a bunch of meangless tasks to hit that one point in the game that unlocks a small video file to show you what is going. But it feels awaward at best and interuptive and more of a 'reward' for reaching this point in the game. In defiance, this is not the case. The movie starts and then the action and what happens next and how the movie cuts in the game is SUPER fluid with everything you interact with. I was so impressed with how this made up the world that as an FPS and as an MMORPG this out performed almost all games I have been testing over the years. Especially the F2P... I am just blown away at the quality and detail used to create the 'I am here, and have a mission, and it is important' feel of the game. The publisher uses NPCs that mix right in with the cinematic scenes. It is very generous to give the story telling in a smooth, interesting, and over all pleasing game play experience. When not doing the main story arc missions, you will run across 'side quests' or live events happening all over the living world. You have open world littered with buildings and forest and encampments well entrenched. There is no stretch of land not used to it's potential to create the living world. As you travel you can pick up these side quests and help some fellow troops pinned down in a persistant battle. You can help link up to a computer system or enter a gun fight to give aid to your fellow man in arms. These are the 'visible' side quests on the map. There are allot of activities and war far events that are popping up off the radar that make you stop pathing to your quest and end up fully engaged in an entire other aspect of the game. I often found myself heading to my quest objective marked on the map, only to run across my people pinned down by gun fire asking for help. As soon as I enter the live zone the objectives are displayed...perhaps other players are already inside progressing and I am much needed back up as an extra gun...You see, that is GREAT co-op mmorpg features that bring people together! A live, persistent world always doing things that, if done together (or solo) will reward and not feel meaningless. As an MMORPG this game shines! It also has arc falls that bring people together for mini raid battles. EXACTLY like in RIFT. This is a meteor like thing that drops from the sky and you have to kill off the enemies waves, and then strategically shoot at weak points in the crystal. The more people doing it the better and it was not surprising to get into a group of 20 easy. There are several mission types and enough things to do to keep replay ability at a high.  I did say 'a meteor like thing' because I have no idea what the TV show has explained about these. As a player who never watches the series I was a little lost in the dialog at times. They talk about how it is bad these aliens are doing things or this technology does this or that...I was totally lost. But it is clear that you are human. Earth was attacked. Technology was to blame. And it is now your mission to help the resistant movement or something rather. So the story is given out on a need to know easy to take in basis. And honestly, I like it! It is interesting, engaging, and works perfectly to get us moving along the path. No 'You are hero fighting for wealth and kingdom' bull crap. A real cinematic and game play experience to push this fantasy world forward. If I had on negative point, it is that in character creation, you have a choice of voice for your avatar, yet he rests silent in the cut scenes. It also is not DEEP as other mmorpgs as far as crafting and getting lost in menus and micro managing your stats all over the place. But it gives you just enough to be deep and thought out.  The skill system for example. YOu pick what kind of soldier you want to be and form this out through skills. You start on a grid and start with a choice of 4 points to start branching out in. Stealth, speed, damage, defense skills etc... I chose a cloak that makes me hide from enemiesrefills my shield for about 5 seconds. After I chose this base skill, all the other skills around it unlocked and I Start building out. I can give bonus to critic damage by crouching. OR chose bonus dmg to enemies rushing you...So you start to see, if you are a fighter that likes to hang back and crouch behind a object, you can build this kind of character to suit your game play. If you like to snipe, you can get scopped bonuses. If you like to rush it you can get bonuses to that. The developers logically and awesomely built the skills and game around letting you fight how you want. I have tried so many FPS and you have to do one thing or the other, and in general all game play is the same. In this, you are complimented to play at your rhythm, style, and nature.",

The weapons are quite varied but they don't scale with level, although rarity can make a big difference, You pick an ego power but basically level up various perks. So a low level can balance against a high level. I find it fun and it reminds me a bit of Warhammer online, which was another under-rated game.

However the only main issue I'm really getting from this game overall is some lag issues here and there forcing me to miss most of my shots when they should have been registered client-side as the game seems to think I'm just standing still server-side when I'm actually moving, aiming, and shooting client-side.  Besides that and whatnot it wouldn't be a terrible idea to try this game out, however I would at least get far and play the game long enough to understand at least SOME concepts of it before considering on purchasing some of the content this game has to offer such as the season pass, but I still have much to look into the other purchasable content other than simple cosmetics.  So yeah no I wouldn't deem this a terrible game just because of some of the lag issues and it's a 'bullet-sponge', honestly anyone who's complaining about a game being a 'bullet-sponge' more than likely only has the poor tastes along the generic lines of battlefield and/or CoD which still just essentially and sadly reskin, remodel, and reuse the same things under a new cover.",

But this game does have a few things wrong that grinds my gears  1. it's really repedative  2. the leveling up system and mission sctructure all seems rather rushed  But if you can look past those flaws then I highly recommend this game.",

It's not exactly super deep yet but the dungeons are excellent, the cutscenes and voice-acting can be cheesy but it's usually pretty good. There are tons of guns. Headshots/skillshots are rewardly handsomely. THere are actually adequate challenges where encounters can be vextremely difficult but possible to overcome. The open-world events are often quite... eventful, for lack of a better word.  Above all else, for being a F2P open-world mmo, it's amazing that I've played this long without the game shoving microtransactions in my face. I haven't been stuck behind any paywalls either.",

I only made it to about 4000 EGO level (out of 6000) but there really is nothing left to keep playing towards. It felt similar to how Borderlands gameplay progressed. Once you've seen all the (very similar) fights, you just do the same thing over and over in hopes that the enemies drop better weapons. No crafting, no skill required after you master the mechanics about 20 hours into playing.   PVP is a nightmare for low levels. They immediately pit you against other players who deal 30x the amount of damage you can. I stopped playing after about 200 hours simply because there is nothing left to do.",

Even though it's boring, there is a sense of addiction that keeps bringing you back. Free to Play or Pay to Play More? You'll still have fun, and this game won't treat players who don't pay as second class players. If anything the paying players may be at more of a disadvantage.  Still recieves updates. They recently added an entire but undeveloped (so far) large Island called Silicon Valley and it's not a DLC. Potential of things to come.  EDIT: I forgot to mention that this doesn't feel heavily like an MMO, the elements are there but it's not too distracting. More often than not you will appreciate having other players with you.
