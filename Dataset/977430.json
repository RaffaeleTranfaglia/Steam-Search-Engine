    "minimum_requirements": "OS: Windows 7 or higher Processor: i5 + anything post 2013 will suffice Memory: 4 GB RAM Graphics: Anything of fair performance post 2012 should suffice DirectX: Version 9.0 Storage: 3 GB available space Sound Card: DirectX 9 or higher compatible sound card Additional Notes: Any computer with parts made between 2013 - 2017+ should meet the minimum requirements of this game. A good way to test this is to play any of my previous games which are 100% free. If you can run them fine, you should be able to run this fine.",
