            "review_text": "Once upon a time, I tried Civilization V. I discovered it was buggy. What I did play was really fun though. So my in-laws bought me Civilization III, which was really fun. I then saw that Civilization IV was on sale, along with the expansions, so I bought the main game and a couple of the expansions. I am currently enjoying the happily ever after. This is one of the most addictive games I have ever played. My husband and I are enjoying a hotseat match in which I am sure will end in a bloodbath. In Civilization IV: Beyond the Sword I am preparing to conquer the world with my mighty Celtic army. Civilization IV is an awesome strategy game in which almost anything is possible. There are so many different leaders to choose, and many different ways to beat the game. Sure, you could do a military victory, but you can also win diplomatically, artistically, and financially. There is also the Space Race... For those of you kind of wary of strategy titles, let me assure you this is a very newbie friendly game. There are a variety of difficulties, and very detailed tutorials to help out. Also, being turn based has a huge advantage in being able to think out what you want to do. Having played Paradox Interactive titles like Victoria II, this is a far cry from the level of complexity found in those games. Nor is it very concerned with historical authenticity. When I first played as Boudicca, a warrior queen of the Celts, I expected to run into one of the Caesars, but instead I ran into General Bismark! My husband demonstrated some interesting divergents from history by having his Germans found Judaism 8), Christianity, and Islam. By what should have been mid-early Dark Ages, his musketmen were busy conquering the Russian Civilization. By the Industrial Revolution, his assorted tanks were conquering the world. He then won peacefully by using the UN to vote himself as the ruler of the world. Yeah...you definitely couldn't do that in a Paradox Interactive title. I know I have many many more hours of enjoyment awaiting me in Civilization IV. This is a great game to play solo or with others. I can't wait to explore all the possibilities.",

The game also has various civilizations to compete against and each leader with it's various traits. It's extremely well developed and the religious aspect is also done very well, each religion has it's own chapel, monastary, cathedral and the religions unique building.

Civilization is one of them  The music is simply epic, combat is challenging (At least to me, but it isn't really a problem), and everything about Civilization seems so perfect!  I highly recommend this to anyone who is intrested in strategy games such as this, and fans of Civilization :)",

Civilization IV is the perfect blend of industrial progress and military strikes. Great as a single player game, at a LAN party with your friends, or over the internet! Civilization V comes close to this wonder, but only once you've included all the DLC :(. Worth the $20.",

Everything about this game is good, the soundtrack is amazing the gameplay is stellar and the way things work is simple and very easy to grasp  However, I did find myself in a lot of trouble when I Alt+Tab out of Civ 4, what happens is the game refuses to load sometimes after doing this command, and since I use a Laptop, the battery warning prompt exists out of the game, so be warned of this if you use a Laptop",

In civalization you are a leader of country only you dictate the outcome of your country. They have needs in order to become happy i will only list a few needs! your people will need  culture,food/farms,stone/quarries,protection/army,and  much,much more! The game it self is more advanced then games today, you can choose to research muiltple sciences like optics,sailing,gunpowder ect. and also expand your empire to let it grow vast and wide. you can choose diffirent leaderships though you will always have complete control of an empire. TOTALLY WORTH IT!!! 10/10",

The Civilization choices are a little limited though. I get this is an older game that isnt as advanced as Civ V and the up and coming Civ VI. But i would have liked to see more civilization choices, or at least more leaders in some of them. This game is also good for another reason. The Multiplayer challanges you to do something new in the game. You can play with your friends against each other alot. Which is something i plan on doing soon. I would recommend this game!
