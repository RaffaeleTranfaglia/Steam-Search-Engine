Still, it works, and is moderately fun.   I did also play the demo for this so, despite the low playtime on my library now, i have actually tried it out properly.",

What's that kids? You'd rather enjoy playing backyard cricket with that stranger across the street who constantly offers you a free vasectomy than play an online game of cricket revolution? This games got you covered!   'A definite MUST BUY if you hate the internet and your friends!' ~ Nelson 'The man' mandela, 2016",
