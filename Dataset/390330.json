            "review_text": "This game is fantastic. I've had this game on my radar for over a year, patiently waiting for its release. I have to say it's extremely fun.  It may feel different controlwise to other platformers - at least for the first hour I had a bit of trouble adjusting. Do stick with it as the game's movement complexity is arguably it's best feature.   Probably the two most important things this platformer can offer in 2016 are: a distinct/unique gameplay feature and a control scheme to deliver said feature well. I never get bored with the simplest platformers when control is top notch, but a lot of players really do get bored of simple gameplay. Mekazoo gives players wanting more complexity something really special.   There are 5 characters unlocked over time that possess a single 'move' or defining mechanic and this really makes this game different. As characters are unlocked, navigation around expansive environments is achieved by your choice of 2 animals at one time, that can be switched on the fly. You essentially just experiment to see what you can do. Once you get the hang of it the flow feels amazing. It takes time but it really gives the platformer genre a bit of a twist that is very welcome for those tired of simpler titles.   Of course a great mechanic needs solid control. I think Mekazoo delivers here. Controls are fluid and quite free flowing (NOT little big planet - more N+ or, slighty floatier than super meat boy). I was worried that I'd find them too floaty but they work well. I can now effortlessly switch between, say, a tongue swinging frog and a kangaroo. It's still precise, just without the extreme agility within the tighter movement of say original megaman.  Overall it's a wonderful game, very fun, with great flowing motion that rewards effort to improve. Lovely to look at too. I really think that with enough attention this will be an important title for platformers in general.  Edit: Ive removed my one minor initial complaint as it's no longer relevant. I stated I lost view of my character in the depth of the lush environments. This doesn't happen if you decide on a colour you like for your animal that has higher contrast to the background. Character colour can be modified to various neon colours and combos.  Last thoughts after more hours logged and all characters unlocked - this game is special and fun. Polished, great level design for slow play or speedruns. Just an amazing addition to the genre. Thanks to The Good Mood Creators for such an awesome game.",

            "review_text": "Mekazoo is a fast past platformer driven by the concept of hot-swapping between different animals to complete each level, and it is fantastic. It takes a little bit to get used to the whole switching thing, but once you do, you will find that levels start flowing really smoothly. Graphically, Mekazoo has a really nice stylized enviornment going for it, and coupled with the 3D areas, it just looks gorgeous. The music in this game is something else, too, so I definitely recommend picking up the soundtrack if you intend to buy this game. Seriously go and listen to some tracks on youtube if you haven't already. Overall, as a diehard platformer fan, both of the more casual games like Mario, and the hardcore ones like the IWBTG fangames, Super Meat Boy, and Wings of Vi, I can highly recommend Mekazoo to anyone who just enjoys playing good platformers.",
