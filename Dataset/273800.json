Just by watching the trailer you will get aclear understanding of what the game is about, but I can further explain that you will play with lots of tools associated with, of course, the theme: forestry simulation.   My experience with it was very pleasant, smooth gameplay together with fancy visuals and neat sounds. I particularly like to try mastering the machines as soon as possible because it will help a lot on winning more revenue from all actions. The main purpose will be to expand your company, and to do so you will need to sell a lot of woosd logs and other related products.  Forestry 17 is a great title, aware of any other forestry simulator out there. BUT!!!!! ---&gt; Needs Steam Trading Cards!!!",
