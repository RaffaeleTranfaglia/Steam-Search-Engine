            "review_text": "Bone: The Great Cow Race is the followup to the Telltale game Bone: Out From Boneville. The game can be played as a stand alone story without any prior knowledge of the Bone comic strip, or the pevious episode, but background knowledge is of course only beneficial. As with the previous iteration, there is alcohol and tobacco use, as well as some cartoonish slapstick humor. There are no bonus features, so the story plays out in a very linear manner. Overall, the story is more humorous than the previous episode, and about double the length as well. If you enjoyed the first episode, you owe it to yourself to try this one too.",

            "review_text": "being a fan of the book series by Jeff Smith and the first game of the series (Bone: Out From Boneville) I definitely liked the second one better. If you would like to see my review of the first one, go check the store and my review is there somewhere. This one is more difficult than the first one. Now, I cheated in this one. I used the help button throughout, making it only take me three hours to beat. Now, if yoiu don't use it, and have never played it, it should take you longer to beat it than the first one. Unlike the first one, this one has more difficulty and problem-solving skills. It even has the possibility of playing as Smiley Bone, as well as Fone Bone and Phoney Bone. In the first game, you couldn't switch between characters whenever you wanted to and you couldn't play as Smiley Bone. The thing about this is that every character you play as is connected in some way. So, when you do a certain thing with one character, it makes it hwlps one of the other characters. When you are finished doing everything possible with one character, you are unable to use that character anymore, so that it makes it simpler for you sto know what to do next. The mini games are minimal in this game, unlike the first one, and concentrates more on problem solving. It is much more entertaining than the first one, much more difficult, and much longer (if you don't use the help button). I recommend this game and I give it 9 out of 10.",
