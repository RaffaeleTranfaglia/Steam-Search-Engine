            "review_text": "I find the game really interesting, and I love the plot so far. Its fairly difficult to progress through, you have to actually put yourself there and think throught the situation as if you were actually there. With the added style of a text adventure it keeps you on your toes with grammar and spelling, which is actually quite fun. The game probably Isn't for everyone being a text adventure and all, but its definitely a well made game thats quite interesting once you figure it out. Personally I love reading so this really appeals to me. With that being said, it probably Isn't for everyone, but you should at least try it before you brush it off as another boring game.  Edit: So 4 days later, playing it on and off throughout the day, I've beat the game. It's definitly more immersive than I initially anticipated, but the plot left me hanging at the end. Someone should just insert some text between the main passages and sell it as an actual book, it would be a tad short though. (Sorry the review Isn't very organized =P)  TL;DR: Try it, its fun and free!  Anyways, great game and 10/10 - Would get shipwrecked again!",

            "review_text": "Overall a let down. The interactivity is very limited by the fact that the path you must take is one and only one, and often counterintuitive so that I had to spend time trying all the options more than using my imagination.  The fact that you can indeed do some wrong things which stop you from finishing the game doesn't help. I ended up looking at solutions more than once, and I wish I had done it before because one action I had taken towards the start stopped me from finishing the game.  The writing is nice but nothing I'd call home about, I feel it could have been a nicer game if more flexible.",

Secondly, I could not find an option to load/save/or delete my corrupt game, and had to reinstall it in order to finish it.   If they fixed this game I would give it a perfect rating for the excellent music and moving storyline. I would still recommend the game but I would have to warn you about that bug because you can't go back or load it without restarting.",

While there were plenty of good things about it, I was hoping for multiple endings to the game. That would have made for a much more tailored experience per player. There were also quite a lot of puzzles that I spent so long trying to figure out that I eventually had to look up a command walkthrough to have alongside the game. The time period and setting for the game is such a plus for me, and while there were some letdowns there were plenty of positives. Everyone should play this game if they like challenges, puzzles, and if they don't mind reading a lot of narration.",

One of my favorite parts of this game is that you can just type in a letter, and suggestions pop up below. This is a fine help to those new to the text based adventure games, but also helps those like me who played them growing up by showing me what options are available.  I would recommend this game to anyone who is interested in the text adventure genre, new or old.",

The case of text adventure games, however, could be a rather tricky one when it comes to that. And that's also probably the only letdown of Mainland; a game I enjoyed for its artistic taste more than anything else.  Oh and by the way, I said the story is mediocre, yet I have to note it's way better than lots of (pseudo-/)adventure titles I've played recently; e.g. Murdered: Soul Suspect, White Night, Alan Wake, and even Lifeless Planet.",
