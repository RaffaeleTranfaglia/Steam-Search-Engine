            "review_text": "I would say my review is similar to others. The game is jittery and I have only really spent time playing during June so it is the current version available. The controls are iffy and trying to build the road is questionable there are times when it just won't let me build so I have to drive backward and forward until it recognizes my car is there. Which with a timed course does not work out.  The concept seemed interesting which is why I tried it but the overall execution fails.",

            "review_text": "It's a pretty bad game.  I believe its main issue centers around the core game mechanic, with you being a car and forced to construct the road before you, meaning you can only move a about a snail's pace which completely negates the purpose of driving a vehicle at all.  That combined with occasional physics bugs and a timer made this a boring experience, and I have no reservation in saying that it was a waste of time. I just couldn't care enough about the game to get frustrated with it.",
