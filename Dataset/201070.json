Sure it's not 'good' by most people standards but if you want to point and shoot, game with friends while not spending too much then this is an intresting little game.  A few game bugs, though.  It's good for the price. I got a 4 pack so I could share it with friends.",

But if you like shoot em up stuff that takes little work and relieves stress, this is an alright game for you. And it's got some cool looking maps.",

If you play L4D or L4D2 a lot you'll be at home when playing online co-op with three of your friends. The menus are exactly the same.   The game is playable; I just hope there will be a community creating extra maps for the game. What let the game down for me is the lack of weapon choice and the overall darkness of the maps as well as grainy graphics. Even when the graphics were maxed out it looked like a game from several years ago. With respect to weapons, what you get is a painkilleresque like weapon that's affixed to your arm. It's effective, but it would be nice to have some variety. To recharge health you pick up the hearts left by the natives you've killed. These restore anything from 5 to 15% of your health for each heart grabbed.  To be honest, I wish I'd waited until this game was on a deal despite it's already relative cheapness.",

Any positive review to this game is either sarcastic or has been written by some one who has taken more then a few blows to the head. This steam pile has been shameless ripped off of Left 4 dead, (Which was a good game I'd remind you), and crapped out a terrible, terrible, awful, game that can only be apperitated on a lethal dose of black tar herion. To truly understand how terrible this game is, feel free to look into the face of one of the first enemies you meet, daze at the stoned unblinking expresison that he always, always displays because the creators only programed one facial expression. You can also listen to the horrible voice acting of the unlikable characters that you are forced to play as using the same method of randomly speaking isn L4D (it's clear that they decided they might go all the way on the ripping off someone elses game). The story of this torture device disguised as a game is a boring and cliche filled story pulled out of the 'writers'' ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, including the mayans (cleverly disguised as aztecs because the writers are racist to long dead civilizations as well as ♥♥♥♥♥) and crystal skulls which were no doubt based on the Indiana Jones movie that everyone hated and I assume that the makers of this programed abortion were in the same mind set. It should be noted that this game is the first 'game' made by the company Dark Artz Entertainments which is a slur in some third-world contries. While some game creators start slow in the great race of greatness, Dark Fartz (aren't I a genius) have fallen over, brained themselves on the black top, and killed at least two onlookers. In 2012, a lot of thick people thought that the world would end, it didn't, but we got revenlations 2012 instead, perhaps that's what the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t prophecy was really warning about, and if that's the case I wish we all were killed.  In conclusion, don't buy this game, unless you hate yourself. Then I can only say cheer up mate, you'll get over her.",
