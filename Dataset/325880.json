            "review_text": "Crystal Catacombs calls itself a 'retro inspired [...] love letter' and, as someone who was around to see the birth of video games, it certainly feels that way to me. This is a side-scroller from Hell, but man is it fun. The game play reminds me of a cross between Zelda II (trying jump while attacking, for example) and Commander Keen (jumping on platforms while dodging or attacking enemies, with the goal of finding a key that allows you to exit the level). The graphics are bright and, at times, feel more inspired by Atari than Nintendo (I love the jumping spider...ish...y looking thing) and the music is bass heavy and interesting enough to keep me from turning it off, as I usually do.  In terms of the difficulty level: If you're familiar with older, brutally unforgiving titles such as Hydlide or Heroes of the Lance, you'll feel right at home here. Each touch from an enemy or certain environmental features depletes your health bar, while others affect you in other ways (such as slowing your character down). Some enemies, once dead, leave behind nasty residual auras that can kill you if you're not being careful.   The controls are responsive and immediate (at least when using the keyboard, as I've not yet tried a gamepad). The most common complaint is that the jumping is slow, but I don't see it that way. Rather, the jump executes as soon as the player presses the appropriate key, but the arc in which your character falls is slow and wide, meaning you'll actually need to plan each jump and practice enough to become skilled at it. This is definitely a feature I remember seeing a lot of back in the day. Come to think of it, the PC in the original Pitfall (which this game's Jungle level reminds me of quite a bit) jumped the same way, and that's going back to the Atari 2600. Falling after missing an important jump can be incredibly frustrating, but I can't ever say it's unfair, and it's always my own fault.  The thing to remember is that Crystal Catacombs may appear to be a colorful platformer (even it's name sounds generically retro)...but it wants you dead. You need to crush your desire to burn through each level, take your time, and kill it with fire. If this kind of repetitive pain sounds like it's as much fun for you as it is for me, then grab it (especially if you can find it in a bundle or at a discount). Recommended.",

            "review_text": "Good game with a diverse range of levels, enemies, and power ups. Reminds meof games like Risk of Rain or Spelunky, where you die frequently and most playthroughs are short, but with a combination of persistence and luck you will occasionally make it past another milestone that makes the next playthrough easier (in this case, the game saves your progress after each successfully completed world, so you can start next time with the levels and powerups you had when you defeated the last boss).",

            "review_text": "Controls are brought up throughout many of the reviews, and while they take a little while to adjust to, I don’t see that as a fault of the game. As soon as you figure out how to jump in this game you quickly find that there isn’t much to jump into at all and that’s really the bigger flaw.   Every biome has its own little quirks that range from floors being a bit slippery to falling pieces of annoying death that plague the entire level. Some levels seem to outshine others in frustration and challenge, but after a bit of adjustment the levels end quickly. Each biome also has some different enemies that all fall under the uninspired category. The monsters have predictable patterns, so learning how to kill them comes quickly. Both of these things are good because there is little incentive to explore levels: the treasure room can be useful sometimes, but otherwise the main goal is just to grab the key and move on. Leveling up can make your character very powerful so there is no need to bother with the shops in the game, especially because everything there is overpriced.  There just isn’t an incentive to play Crystal Catacombs. I had started to write a guide for this to help others out, but I gave up after a few hours because it just isn’t that fun to play. Some deaths feel cheap, but none of the victories felt satisfying. I think the only learning curve comes from the time it takes to learn how to jump, from then on its just eye strains and an over-too-quick feeling as you face the final boss. The final boss was actually pretty annoying, but more than that, I couldn’t believe there was just that was the end and with other content. There are cards to collect, but collectathons are only fun if the gameplay can support it.  Crystal Catacombs is a game that should ultimately be buried away in most people’s Not Interested in pile. All of the gameplay mechanics that it touts are forgettable at best. Instead of shooting for random elements and levels, it might have fared better with carefully constructed levels, much like the games that inspired it. ",

            "review_text": "A pixel-art action roguelite that plays like a metroidvania although it is very flawed.   the most glaring flaw is it is repetitive and withholds any cool power ups to make it actually interesting. I played this game for about twenty minutes and did not get a single item drop. Are there items? I assume so. There is an inventory. There is a weapon quick select bar on the top of the screen.  But nope. Same crap starting sword with its same crap range for the entire twenty minutes I played it. This is like if one of the older castlevania games refused to put any throwing daggers or axes in any of the candles for the first three levels. Of course the game is going to utterly fail to maintain my interest if it doesn't let me do anything interesting. Twenty minutes is a long time for an action game. I don't think it is too much to ask to do something but a single basic sword sweep during that time and haven't seen anything like that outside of coffee break flash clicker games from the year 2000.   I will give it one thing - the enemies have some really neat designs.",
