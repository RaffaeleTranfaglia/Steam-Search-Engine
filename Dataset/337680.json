            "review_text": "Overall I've enjoyed what I've played of the game. The more I've played it the more its grown on me. At this point I'd give it an 8/10. I doesn't come across as anything revolutionary but its a pretty solid game. It mixes neat elements like ships only being able to fire in a limited number of directions with turn based gameplay. So its kind of like naval combat in some of the Total War games (and probably other games) I guess in that sense. Combat also reminds me of the combat in Space Rangers 2 mixed in with the graphics and feel of Star Wolves 3.  I've only played the first five missions but so far story wise they seemed alright. Just alright though. I'm hoping at this point it evolves into something a bit more substancial because its coming across as being pretty generic.  Ultimately, its a turn based game. So if you aren't into that kind of thing you probably shouldn't buy it.  Most of the negatives I have about the game are more nitpicking on my part on ways it could be improved. I'd still overall recommend the game.   Positives:  - Combat is reasonably smooth and the game is pretty enjoyable as far as I'm concerned.   - I experienced no major bugs  - The background art between missions looks really nice. Obviously the game graphics themselves are not 2015 level graphics, but they are reasonable I think given the price.   - Seems like the game has a lot of potential.   Negatives/suggestions  - It would be nice if there was a waypoint option. Something like Space Rangers 2 where if you've selected a location on the map to travel to (that is outside of your ability to travel to in one turn) you don't have to manually say to go to the next turn in cases where you aren't being fired at.  - The commander/captain of any vessel probably could be shown in a larger text size.   - The first mission dumps a lot of info on you before you probably really need it. Info about the UI could probably be spread out more.  - Some kind of indicator that projects an enemies movement limitations. Particularly if I'm supposed to be (according to the story) familiar with a ship design.  - It would be good if you had an option to turn off automatic dialogue. Sometimes the pacing of the dialogue is a bit off and it takes forever for your wingman to say what they were going to say.  - Very limited ship customization options from what I've seen so far.  - To me it doesn't make much sense that given the 3D nature of space that a ship would only exclusively be able to fire forward or behind it (or exclusively to the sides). Outside of smaller craft like fighters ships should have some ability to shoot targets on their weaker sides, even if that ability is considerably weaker than their ability to shoot on their stronger sides. The only exception to that might be a ship that is exclusively designed to fire a big gun in one direction (like an Ion Frigate in the Homeworld series).  - More significance for the Z axis. If this has some significance then that isn't made clear. It doesn't seem like it has any combat significance.  - The movement of ships can be pretty finicky. You'll click on a ship's shadow and it won't register that you clicked on it. This could be improved I think.",

            "review_text": "If you don't care about graphical quality and are looking for a small fun space fleet combat game, then you will have a great time with this game. While feeling graphically incomplete and unpolished there is a solid core game that is fun to play through multiple times.   Pros:  * This space combat portion of the game is great.  * The combat controls give you a sense of the characteristics of each ship, and the ships don't all feel the same.  * The methods used to control your ship are straightforward and easy to use.  * There are some solid RPG elements such as building your fleet over time, and mission decision making over the course of the campaign.  * The player's playstyle assessment assisting in the mission type availability is something I found rewarding and made me want to play through again but play the missions differently.    Cons: * Graphically the game feels very prototype and unpolished even for the price point.  * The UI is definitely the most unpolished portion of the game.  * UI Layout for the ship is scattered all over the place.  * Menus overlap everywhere and the iconography is horrible, all the buttons are hard to read.  * The story dialog is very poorly written. Even though the storytelling format is solid.  * The campaign menu is poorly implemented graphically.    ",
