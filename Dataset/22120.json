            "review_text": "  'Every time, it’s harder to pull out. Every time, I feel more of myself inside.”    Penumbra: Black Plague is the second of three episodes in the Penumbra series. While continuing the compelling storyline from the first instalment it also improves the characterization of the protagonist. Furthermore, the excellent music background contributes to the immersive atmosphere of the game. The puzzles are challenging and enjoyable, without being illogical or forced.   Without the awkward combat system of the prequel, your only means of defense are hiding, running or using the environment to your advantage, leaving you with a sense of helplessness on your journey of self-discovery.     Trivia:    Penumbra: Requiem is the third and last episode in the Penumbra series. Originally intended to be a trilogy the series was reduced to two episodes due to unidentified problems with the previous publisher, Lexicon Entertainment. In the end, the third instalment came in form of an expansion pack in order to tie up loose ends and put the focus more on the puzzles.    Amusing quotes:      “Is the emergency figurative or literal? A figurative emergency might, for example, involve an undersupply of coffee to the vending machines. A literal emergency, on the other hand, might involve flesh eating monsters rampaging about the facility.”      “So… you are running around with a human body part in your backpack, and I am supposed to be the bad guy?”      Achievements:    The game has no Steam achievements.

Though there are zombies, don't let that discourage you. They're not your typical stupid walking corpse, but more terrifying. For the price that it is, I would recommend purchasing it.

The only thing which kinda annoyed me is the fact that the enemy AI is dumb. And I'm not talking about 'sometimes dumb' but rather 'full Donald Trump dumb'. It makes the game way too easy if you've been spotted.  Anyhow, the game is still recommendable due to its story and gameplay. So go ahead and buy it! You won't regret it.",

Basically just think of these as Amnesia, with a better story, better graphics, less shitactular gameplay, and with a playable view. Like seriously, Amnesia is 50% filter, 30% camera shake for the fear. If you want a scary game, get this, if you want a mediocre overrated semi-scary game with no story (or rather, a boring one) and hate fun, get Amnesia. The game is basically a horror game with puzzles, an interesting story, and well, that's about it. If you want to be freaked out, get this game for sure. Amnesia IS NOT, anywhere near Black Plague's league, ignore the hype, if you can't , get both games at least. 9/10",

The physics engine adds a lot to the game, making it stick out a bit amongst its peers (especially for its time) as you can pick up items and place/throw them as you wish. This is primarily utilized for puzzles and creating obstacles to hide from enemies.  The story doesn't go too far in this entry, mostly setting the scene for the sequel.

If you're the kind of person who can immerse yourself in the atmosphere of horror games (and why would you be considering this otherwise?) you're going to love it. I found Black Plague to be scarier than Amnesia, but then I never really had a chance to get scared properly by Amnesia because there were always other people around when I was new so by the time I got to play alone I knew exactly what would happen and when, so your mileage may vary. The Penumbra pack is only $20 so stop reading this, get your ♥♥♥ out there and buy the games.",

I also recommend it if you have played amnesia, and no penumbra games.",

            "review_text": "Black Plague is a decent horror/puzzle/stealth game. Compared to Penumbra Overture, Overture was better for a few reasons. Some of the scares from Black Plauge were recycled in the sense that how they scared you in the first game was what they also used in this game which lowers the suprise element, at least for me. Black Plauge also brings in a lot of story which is a good thing for a game, but I think they might have overdone it a bit, they tried to do too much at the end. Without spoiling the end, it became very reminiscent of another popular game, story wise. Lastly, the voice in the head was annoying and killed the mood for me.   the good news is as stand alone game not compared to the first, the game is pretty good. It' s hard not to compare to the first game though as the story runs over, and if didn't play the first one, you would be really confused story wise. Anyway, good maps, great atmosphere, freaky creatures, and decent puzzles.  6.5/10",

I invested quite a lot of playing hours into these games and I have never come across another series that did it quite like Penumbra. Satisfying story, excellent visuals, extremely well done suspensful moments coupled with probably the best interaction to the environment I've had ever. You really feel immersed in this world and invested in the task to uncover the story. I love these games.",

            "review_text": "The developers cut the disappointing parts of Overture (combat and weak/confusing story) and added an impressive amount of depth and plot on top of the existing foundation.  This game is an exciting narrative with mostly interesting physical puzzles sprinkled throughout. A couple of the puzzles felt tedious to me, particularly towards the end. I didn't find the story to be particularly profound, though.   Even more dissapointingly, I had hoped more than anything that the game would build on the immersive, horrific atmosphere of the first episode, and genuinely creep me out even more, in the same way that SOMA did. I found that the game fell well short of this. Maybe it was Penumbra saturation, but this episode hardly felt like a horror game at all. For 2008 tech, the world and graphics are spectacular and hold up well, but it felt like a video game and not the horrifying universe I wanted to wade into for a few hours.  Fricitional -- as ever -- gets my strongest recommendation for a fun, thoughtful game that emphasizes story, atmosphere, and puzzles above shooting guns for 5 hours.",

Was that sound in your head? Who's there? Friend or Foe?  This game is truly one of the few games that uses both Sight and Sound to maximum effect...Without any weapons or means of deffending yourself, you must switch off the lights and Hide in the very shadows that hunt you...Only will your ears tell you if it's safe...But then again...In a place where strange noises are in abundance, nothing can be rellied upon. Caution Advised.  Play it in the dark all alone on until dark for a truly scary experience...  One of the greatest games in its genre...Too bad about Clarence...",
