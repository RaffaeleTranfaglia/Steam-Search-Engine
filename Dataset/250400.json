            "review_text": "Updated on 26.10.14   I really don't know why the game How to Survive managed to get that low MC score. It's really beyond me...  Let's get back to the game itself.  The graphic is really cool .The terrain ,swapms ,trees ,wreckages and characters are design beautifuly ,and there is no one bad thing to be said about gameplay either. Everything works smoothly as it should.Even sounds and other special effects  are created with precision and they sound...real!  Two things that strike me while I was playing How to Survive was :  Very interesting crafting system allowing you to craft almost anything by combinig  items you have found or salvage from surroundings . Example :if you combine Rusty Helmet and bones you will get spiky helmet , or combine a bottle of water and lemon and you will get quess what...? A lemonade!!! You may find car tires ,metal sticks ,or piece of hard rock and create some very usefull stuff. There is another interesting aspect to your quest for survival I forgot to mention : some items such as raw meat or fish ,need to be cooked first ,otherwise you will get sick.  The second thing that need to be mention here is guy named Kovac (such a character!!!) who appears here and there giving you best advices called 'Kovac's Rules' to help you  survive your mayhem . Kovac is smart and very funny in his simplistic way and he is superb additinon to How To Survive.  So...maitain you health ,thirst ,hunger ,and tirenes .Create armor ,and weapon that will  help you kill even the toughest Zombies .Develop your survival skills ,forage ,and hunt to  get fresh meat . Do anything and everything to survive this excellent horror game .  After months of absence...  When I came back to H2S game I was really amazed of what the developers did to H2S... The game itself became even more interesting .You are able now to create more weapons ,find more stuff on the ground , and create better armour than before... H2S is more excting than before ...you got more achievements to score and more receipies to discover...Love this game and it's latest update's .    Love it!!!  Dan.",

            "review_text": "How To Survive is a very decent action game with pretty graphics and a nice, extensive crafting system. But after a few hours it's just that; pretty graphics and crafting, in addition to killing zombies. The killing feels satisfying by the way, but you basically go from one point to another, all across an island, doing basic quests. And if you're done on one island, it's on to the next one, which is basically the same as the previous one only bigger. If it were only more interesting. Giving the player more to do would've definitely helped this game out, especially since there's so much stuff to craft.  In the end it's just ok-ish, but still worth a look.  [Rating: 70/100]",

This game is entertaining, challenging and involving, while I play I am always wondering what will happen next and it is built in a way that it is not too easy but you rarely get stuck you flow greatly throughout the whole game, the plot is great and it's also quite humorous which is not something you normally have in most survival games. You can play on your own or with friends, although the multiplayer view can be sometimes frustrating it is always amusing to go through the story with friends by your side.   Overall: It's a great game and I honestly recommend it!",

Gather stuff that you find all over the islands and combine them to powerful items. Manage your character and limited inventory space, find water and food so you don't starve, find shelter to sleep when you are exhausted and protect yourself from the creatures on the island.  Kill hordes of Zombies with your ever improving crafted weaponary and armor and find a way off the island.  This game is not hardorce survival horror. More a top-down shooter.",

            "review_text": "I was unsure about this game because of the mixed reviews but I bought it for under $4 during a sale and I'd say I got my moneys worth.  The game felt pretty unique to me with the combat and crafting systems as well as the general environment and night/day cycle. The graphics are reasonable, sound is good, gameplay is fun. A certain degree of strategy is certainly required as there are different types of zombies and environmental challenges.  You have to manage health/thirst/sleep which I love in a survival game. There is also a day/night cycle and special enemies come out at night.  The coop mode also shows promise but I have not yet tried it.   Weapons  There is some variety to the weapons you can craft (ranging from a simple bow to a compound bow with fire arrows to pistols to SMG's to assault rifles to shotguns to precision rifles) and they are satisfying to shoot enemies with. I like how you have to 'focus' your shots to get headshots. You can make molotovs and bombs too.   Crafting/Inventory  The crafting system works, isn't too clunky but isn't extremely exciting either. You're very limited as to how much you can carry but I've rarely found myself in need of something I didn't have (at least in regards to ammo/stims/food/water), it mostly just becomes tedious when you're trying to collect items for crafting.   Story  There's not much to the story but it loosely strings together a series of tasks that keep you going.   Abilities  The level-up perks, or ability tree, or whatever you want to call it is kind of a waste - it will make your stats and abilities slightly better but nothing exciting.",

If it feels like there is a 'but' coming, to me there is.  The game is great, has very well thought out elements, but it's a little more hack and slash, action game, than a survival or RPG.  Has all the elements of a great RPG, skill tree, crafting, but, it always feels very linear.  You have a story to follow and a path to follow and although you can go back to pick an extra herb or gather more resources, you feel you don't really need to since the game is progression in front of you and behind, is behind.  The DLC available adds two game modes that feel a little more 'open end', but, still feels like this could have been huge and falls just short of it with the constrains imposed by the design followed.  Good fun though, and with co-op you can laugh with a friend while hacking through hordes of zombies, that die in countless ways.",

            "review_text": "Not a bad game at all. Game starts off by leaving you stranded on an island with virtually nothing but your wits and clothes, and was quite an enjoyable experience for me. The talent system felt kind of lacking and pointless to me, however, and the game offers only up to about 15 hours of gameplay i'd say. After that it'll probably rot in your library un-touched. Combat is not too bad, controls are pretty solid, graphics are kinda nice, and the game is an ok pc-port, dis-regarding the fact that controller buttons still show up instead of keys. I would say to wait for a %50 sale+ since the game won't last you very long. If the storyline had been longer or had more things to do, i would consider buying it full price (I picked it up on a sale for $3)  UPDATE: (10/3/14) Lately, a lot of other DLC have been added to the game which potentially boost the playtime of it to around, say, 20-30 hours depending on how fast you play. If you do plan on purchasing the DLC along with the game, go for the bundle (If you want the El Diablo Islands DLC you'll have to wait a bit before they add it to the package). Question is, do i recommend the purchase of the DLC? The answer, however, is totally dependent on how you feel about the game and whether you enjoyed it or not. I consider H2S a hidden gem on the steam market of the zombie/survival genre, and I would recommend the DLC if you have the money. Even without DLC, the game is completely playable and should still provide a fun experience. Basically, if you have your doubts about the DLC, don't buy them. If you liked the game, get the DLC. (Try and wait for a sale also, unless you just want the game that badly)  TL;DR DLC add about an extra 10 hours to the game and I do recommend if you enjoyed the game, if you have mixed feelings then i don't recommend them.",

The game actually a shorted top-down version of Dead Island. A little tip to make a very strong weapon that can help through the whole game even at most boss fights. You need 3 bones, any sharp weapon and a flint stone. Use the sharp weapon on bones to make them into bone blades, combine them with theirselves, and lastly combine the result with the flint. The end is the strongest boomerang weapon, cheap and can be earn early. Tip 2: There are some recipes that are not in the survival guide, you have to figure those out by yourself.",

            "review_text": "I decided to reinstall this game when I saw that it was on sale for less than 2 dollars today. I'm really glad I did, because this game is awesome. Sure the graphics aren't great, and the fighting is a little bit clunky, but this is the best survival game out there that is actually finished.   In this game you are stranded on an island, and you have to craft a lot of items to survive. You have to manage health, sleep, hunger, and thirst meters to stay alive. The crafting system is really simple, but it works really well. There are a whole bunch of different things to craft, and you can play differently depending on the items you craft.   There is no story. Even though technically there are characters and dialogue, it's pretty terrible. But that doesn't really matter when you are just taking it as a surival game. In the story mode I mainly skipped the dialogue. The exception to this rule is the survival guides you can pick up. These guides help you to be better at the game, but they are hilarious! Kovac who wrote the book narrates and is a really funny character.   The DLC in this game is mostly just cosmetic, but at a sale price it is worth getting. There are different costumes for each character, and the ability to craft fire weapons. These fire weapons come in really handy. There are also a couple game modes to buy, and even a new map to play. The DLC is really cheap when it is on sale, so there is no reason not to get it.   There is online co op and local co op for this game, so don't worry about that. It's often best to play with a friend, but you really need to play together. I don't think that there is in game chat or voice chat so you will need to play with someone you know using Skype or something because this is the type of game where it is a lot easier when you have a good teammate and good communication.   I've been playing a lot of games like DayZ, The Dead Linger, Rust, and others. These are mostly great, but the biggest gripe I have is they aren't finished yet. Even don't starve is adding a multiplayer mode that isn't quite finished. This game is completely done, and has a lot of DLC. So while DayZ and other survival games will probably end up being much better games, this one is really good now. As far as survival games, this is the one I would recommend you get if you are waiting for updates on DayZ or rust.   Other then the story you can also play the challlenge modes. These are fun because you start each level with nothing and then you have to find and craft everything. You can change the difficulty if you have already beaten the game and it will still give a challenge. These modes add a lot of replayability, and it is fun to just play a couple challenges with a friend when you are short on gaming time.   At 15 dollars, I could recommend this game to survival fans, but at a sale price of 2 or 3 bucks, this game can be fun for anyone. The crafting system is fun, the game has a lot of content when you add the DLC, and with online co op there is a lot of replayability.",

And that reason is probably good enough to tell you that if you're into these types of games that you will enjoy it. There's lots of stuff to collect, lots of weapons and armor to craft so you will always find yourself occupied in a good sense of the fashion. The zombie killing mechanics are quite entertaining. The sprint button, weapon charge and aiming system makes taking care of the zombies fun.And there's always something to do such as monitoring your Health, Hunger, Sleep and thirst meters, ensuring they are substantial at all times. Also, the quests eventually lead you to new locations. There's lots to explore, in a well designed and graphically detailed world with new Zombie type monsters lurking around every corner, confronting you with new challenges. Not to mention the skill tree which is unique to every character, you will find certain skills to benefit your party early on. The Co-op gameplay has a lot going for it, and when you're playing online there are tombstones scattered around the map indicating where players from the internet had their characters die in the game. Overall, I am enjoying the experience, and I can recommend it.",

It seems to me that most of the gameplay revolves around scavaging and crafting, there's quests and sidequests - given to you by monkeys I might add - but most of them are 'go get this thing and bring it back to me' or some variation. Most of it is very grind-y, this in addition to the combat styles result in a subtle Diablo or Fate feeling to the game, strangely. The story is pretty much there because there has to be one, its pretty obvious from the start who the antagonist is (in the base game at least, I haven't made it to the DLC campaigns yet). That's offset somewhat by the fact that the game is co-op enabled for two people, I suppose (again, not unlike Diablo and its ilk).  Still, its fun enough, I kept trying to get to a good stopping place and ended up playing several hours more than I thought I wanted to (in a good way). That, combined with the cost (it can be had very cheaply on damn near any Steam sale) makes it well worth its disk space, in my opinion; the 60 metacritic is a little low, I would put it closer to 70, 75-ish. Its no Dying Light (based on what I read), but I don't think its trying to be. Seriously, I think its trying to be Diablo with zombies more than anything ^^",

The night crawlers-although a bit unnerving on first encounter-are laughable as long as your flashlight shines on them WHICH it NEVER runs out of battery power :S  I like the crafting system and skill trees, that's interesting. And the noise mechanic is kinda there, especailly when opening a ssaf house door. I would wish that this game however could toughen itself out in future updates. And make the player more terrified that he/she doesn't have the materials to make something they can't do w/o or less sources for food/water/shelter.  AGAIN, recommended ONLY ON SALE, $4's is worth it since it's not the worst game ever made (*cough* Colonnial Marines *cough*) But at the same time it's only for a more casual or newer player, not a hardcore one. Short story/easy enemies = short game but it DOES have positives and while it's still on sale try it out for yourself and decide... before it goes back to original pricing!!!!!  Hope this helps.

How to Survive : Storm Warning Edition Review ***THIS IS THE SPECIAL EDITION*** The Special Edition of this great game adds new stuff, and it is very worth having. It adds fireproof alternate suits for 3 characters, and is worth having. It also teaches you how to make Barricades, which may be worth having in Multiplayer. This game does not get the attention it deserves. It is a very great game with very great ratings.  For both editions, this game recieves a 10/10. This game has gotten me so excited, even when I was installing it. It's worth more than what it's selling for. The Special Edition is very reccomended.   I would buy it for friends to play with.",

It was definitely worth it and, if I had had the chance to try out the gameplay prior, I probably would have paid full price.  Now, that said, the game's storyline isn't particularly long nor complex and, though you can re-play as three different characters, the story and NPC reactions are exactly the same (the character stats are different and do affect the gameplay for each, though not a whole lot). However, there is the option to play online with others, so there's that.  BUT, what this game is is just plain fun. The crafting system offers a diverse range of weapon possibilities, there are a variety of zombie types, there are sleep/thrist/hunger meters and you have to keep an eye on them or your abilities/stats will take a hit, the gameplay ramps up in difficulty nicely as the game progresses, and... It's just a lot of fun!  Gameplay is very similar to Diablo, as others have mentioned and I think it's a good purchase.",

It wasn't overly complex but required some discovery and encouraged picking up everything just to see what you could do with it. - Challenging encounters. Not everything was go in and steam roll with a single weapon. You had to swap out weapons (a combination of melee and ranged) and use the best mods (i.e. explosive arrows) to get the job done. - More than one way to skin a cat. There didn't seem to be a single way to play this game. It was basically all about how you wished to accomplish a goal. - Semi mindless hack and slash.

It gets tiring having to fight again in an area you’ve just recently explored. You must go through way too many screens to load a saved game and you can only save the game at certain points. The dialogue/voice acting isn't great and most of the missions are simple fetch quests. Inventory management is a bit of a chore. The NPCs just stand in the open and never defend themselves or even get attacked. It disengaged me from the atmosphere.   Overall, I recommend How to Survive.

You will also want to explore to find good items which adds more into what makes the whole package of the game work. Only annoyance I find is that you do have to walk around to travel the different islands, since not everything is available on one island. Really, you will be spending a good amount of time walking around because apparently, the boats can only go a specific docks instead of allowing you to use one boat to travel to all visited islands. These docks are usually far apart, and you'll have to maze through the islands just to travel from island to island. That's probably the only annoyance that I've found. Story-wise, it's pretty ok. I've only played one character, and I can only guess that each character has their own story path to follow. As to what most reviewers can note, the crafting system for items you pickup is the bloodline of this game. Most story quest do require you to craft, and at a certain point, there's no reference for an item you needed to craft and you'll need to use your imagination (or google) to figure out what you needed to craft. 7/10",

Really the only things I don't like about this game are that it seems to be limited at 2 people for multiplayer and you share a screen (which can be a bit of an annoyance at times). Oh yeah, and the lightning sucks. I hate the lightning. The lightning is really annoying. Fortunately it only seems to be a major factor on one of the seven or so islands in the game. Also, don't throw your boomerang out right before talking to someone. If the boomerang is in mid-air when a conversation starts, it seems to result in the boomerang ceasing to exist. That's the only major glitch I've found so far though, and is easily enough avoided.  Overall I would definitely recommend this game (especially for the summer sale price).

H2S; is a top down, action, rpg shooter with elements of crafting and survival; fish, hunt cook mix drinks... make explosives, chase down zombies and be chased by hordes of wild emus...   It offeres a unique and fairly realistic point of view on the genre while also adding masses of zombies and keeping the arcade/action elements to the game.   Storywise;  Played as one of three unique heroes who've crashed onto the shores of a mysterious island, you quickly find friends and begin your long journey to escape this serene island paradise. As you set out you will meet a small cast of folks also trapped here, among them kovak, who will ultimately train you to be a survivor and if you are lucky make it out alive.   Inspirations and fun perks;  The game here takes generously from the many 'zombie survival guide' sub-genre and has a crafting list built around items and artefacts you may find among shipwrecks and abandoned towns on a tropical island, take chains, bike motors, jerry cans and a harpoon gun trigger and you have a chainsaw... Hungry? roast some emu meat add mushrooms and you have a steak fit for a Queen!  Collect Items, fruits and trash, build weapons and ammunition, keep yourself well fed and hydrated! and lets not forget catch up on sleep now and then... this game will be a great romp through what is similar to a Dead island setting but very much unique in its own way.   What I think and why you ought to give it a go!   It seems to be an X-box port but I'm glad I found this gem. 9/10, as it fulfills all my criteria, simple controls are made functional and fluid  fair amount of variation allows for flexibility and a great deal of aesthetics are included to build immersion. You can dismantle most everything you build and re-build weapons to suit the occasion!  I've just finished it, the only shame is it seemed to be fairly short and I would have enjoyed it more had I another island to explore with perhaps more variations in zombies and perhaps a better explanation of their existance!   Value for money, the games $7~ AUD, really thats a burgermeal more or less, If you can get an hour out of this game, you are already winning... enjoy the experience and the warm sandy beach feeling, the soothing crash of the waves... the moaning of zombies in the night, while many seek to tackle the genre with cheap knock-offs H2S has done it right and went all the way to bring you a game done right.",

I didn't have but $15 left in my account to last me for the week.   And damn am I glad I did.  I've been entertained from the start. The zombies are, well... zombies. Some fast, some slow, big fat ugly ones and sneaky little buggers too. Rarely do I find myself feeling uncomfortable whilst playing a game. Uncomfortable in the sense of 'I don't want to complete x mission because it just got dark and I really don't think it's a good idea to go wandering out in the fog right now'.  This one nails it.  There is always a pressing desire to get enough food, find sleeping/safe areas, and make sure the Jerry cans are filled with water,   Survival and quick thinking is absolute key for this game; thirst, hunger, sleep and health all play exponentially important parts in this ever-surprising Diablo-style slash-n-hack, craft-yer-guts-out game.  12/10 would download again (even at full price).",

Plus the story seems quite intriguing at the very start but turns out to be sort of weak( I can pretty much guess Kovac is THE bad guy at first glance i mean what kind of normal dude would wear a gas mask around and be so deft at handcrafting(making weapons etc.) unless he's a lunatic LOL)..Well meh i guess ive lost the momentum to continue but just been browsing steam store and found the early access for a sequel.. This is a not bad game but still hope they are making progress to improve the cons :D  5/7 Update Well, looks like collecting 20 packages wasn't that hard but did prove the designers were running out of ideas, my comment on its weak story still holds true. The ending left me quite bemused with its two villains luring coupla other poor guys onto the island(calling'em recruits). Kovac was a bad person, fine with it, but that crippled old dude too? Well, don't really seem to understand why that is. Plus, am I the only one that wonders even granted these two buddies are in some sort of collusion still there's just no point for all of this? Are they just like super bored as castaways and got nothing better to do? Shouldn't be serious about it tho lol(who was saying the story is pretty weak??)",

            "review_text": "H2S is a fun, if not slightly small, Diablo-esque game about survival on a small island chain that has been overrun by the undead. Not a fresh premise, to be sure, but one that you'll find both enjoyable and (on Ironman) challenging. Within reason, this title blends together well with exploration and on-the-fly item creation, as well as melee and distinct shooter elements which help to keep the zombies at bay. The main quest line is not cumbersome or incredibly time consuming, and the secondary monkey quests provide a decent distraction. I've put a handful of hours into this so far, and have really enjoyed it thus far, and plan to get the 'Nina' DLC for it.  The drawbacks, however, might turn some people off. The dialogue is one sided, meaning you never really hear from your hero or give any feedback. The islands are not terribly large, and while there are several of them, offer no substantial time investments from moving place to place.  One other fairly large drawback is that the game boasts of each character having different skill trees...which is -somewhat- true. But what makes them different in their skill sets is really minimal, and has less bearing on how you play the game. For example, Jack is touted as a melee character, being larger and stronger than the others. In his skill tree though, there's little to nothing (ability wise) which plays on this. Most of the focus in all 3 trees lies around fire skills (be it explosives, or molotovs), but that completely bypass the melee strengths that a character like Jack possesses. It would have been nice to see the characters' skill trees built around their actual strengths and be *very* different from one another, rather than have half them skills the same identical item, and the other half just a different work around the same identical theme.   Still, given this, the game is entertaining and hopefully there will be larger expansions (or a H2S sequel) which can address such item. Worth picking up, especially during the Steam sale.",

Dont let the bad reviews deter you from buying this little Gem of a game as it it sure to please. The graphics are pretty good, storyline is good, and survival is sometimes not easy, Going from place to place and completing some of the challenges has got me hooked to want to complete this game now, I personally play most games on ultra settings so of course i will get half decent gameplay, but as long as your pc meets the requirements then you should get this game. expecially if your not the only one who plays the games on your pc, as this game i would say is safe for 12+ as long as mediocre gore is ok with the parents, Well i have been playing this game strictly now as i am hooked, I want to finish the game on insane next :-) So i change my vote for this game out of 10, is 10 for being really worth every penny 1 is for no good 5 is for its ok, but this one gets a 10..",

            "review_text": "First, I wouldn't recomend to buy this game for more than about 5€.  Even the plot is a bit boring, the guide books are alot of fun to watch, sadly there are not so many. The controls are awesome, it makes alot of fun. The island are well desinged, you can really see that the creators really wanted to bring on something. To kill hords of Zombies are satiesfiyng, not as satisfying as in many other games but satisfying even for people that don't like that zombie hype so much, people like me. The story is short, you need maximum 8 hours if you try to find anything there is to find. So it is the right game when you don't have to much time, and by the easy and fluent controls you don't have to go trough the crap factor like in other games.  If you look for a little something on the side, I recomend the game.",

I personally recomment the boomerang - you can upgrade it a lot and go trough the whole game only with the boomerang + it's pretty awesome and fun to play with it. It takes about 15-20 hours to go trough the game - it took me 18 hours, but you can rush and cut the time or you can explore more (I left a few things undone - some side quests).

What I would say is that the Keyboard/Mouse controls are a little bit fiddly at times and even by the games little guides it would indicate a Xbox controller would be a much better fit but they are perfectly servicable when you get used to them.  The game really opens up when the sleep/eat/drink mechanics come into play because you are suddenly forced to think a little bit about your character's wellbeing before you plow headlng into a bunch of enemies. I like the instant kill animations and also how they damage other enemies around you so you aren't left wide open for lots of damage while you wait for the animation to end.  So I haven't played for ages or anything but so far this seems to be a pretty good game. If you like survival games you should give it a try.",

The learning curve for this game is well done. It starts off as a challenge while its challenge grows, but not too fast. I would also like to mention the other game select modes for those who want more of a challenge.   Worried that a gun is hard to find on an island? You should be, but why find them when you can make your own guns that work just as well. Item combinations are had here. Bows, guns, and braches to fend off the relentless undead.  &lt;Old Review on Poor Computer&gt;This is a great survival game with zombies, what's not to like. The closest game that I can compare this to is Project Zomboid. It has better controls to PZ, and they are pretty good. The graphics are nice. My main complaint is my computer lagged at a pitiful 4 frames a second, and I could still stomach to play this game for almost an hour before I gave up because of the frame rate.

Usually, it would be the right trigger. But that very trigger is use for something more important than shooting : dodging and dashing. The game is about surviving, not about killing spree.   The story is a string of main and secondary quest in semi-open world. Some sector are not accessible at the start until you find the right tools. Also, each island are like labyrinth with quest, sleep, fire and water spots and shacks containing items.  To progress in the game, you have to find the Kovac's Rules, a parody of a tutorial in the form of books spread across the archipelago. Finding one brings a short, but short movie about survival tips. You'll also find recipe to make weapon, armor, meals and drinks. They are various, unusual, funny and easy to make. Simply combine items. It's even possible to make new items without having found the recipe, instead of game like Fallout 3. Crafting is essential in this game cause it's how you make more powerful weapon, better armors, medics and better food.  It's also a RPG. Level up. Get new competence and make each of your four original survivalist better across the different modes.   I didn't try challenges or multiplayer. Since I'm not into multiplaying, it's the least of my concerns.  In short, it's a solid game who got everything right for casual gaming... except for the annoying repetitve help tips constantly on screen which can be turned off in the option menu.",

It would be great if we could customize our character but maybe this game will have some updates so we will be able to do that. Also what I find as bad thing is the number of maps...u have dlcs that u can buy and get some extra fun at game. It would be much more fun and community would raise if we could make maps for ourselfs or if the develpoers put some maps in the game for free....Game graphics are pretty cool and the story is decent, u can play it multiplayer with no lags (atleast I experienced it like that). Idea of game is very good, we have zombie survival game that isnt just about smashing heads, u need to watch for ur hunger and other stuff; we also have skill tree with is amaizing and u need to play game with little tactic because every charater has different skill tree; also what is good at this game is the crafting feature, things u craft have some logic so u dont need to learn all of them; I didnt played everything yet as I bought game yesterday but I played it for 2hrs and I really enjoyed it, I would like for this game to have more fans because its really fun to play and we can all have good time, I would like from developers to give us some free maps so we can enjoy more in game...All in all game is amazing and try to get it when its sale because u can grab and dlcs for like really funny amount of money...sorry for my english and I hope u will experience this game as me   Cheers",

The game gives enough of a challenge to keep you from getting bored but that aren't too difficult to make you give up. I love how your survival depends not only on fending off the hordes of attacking zombies, but also on hunger, thirst, and health.

Maybe players were expecting much more from the game when it reached final release. High expectations sometimes lead to big disapointements. (for whatever reasons) However, for new players who are asking wherever to buy it or not, i will say: Yes if you can afford it, if not Better wait for sales.  The story is really simple, you are shipwrecked on an island infested with zombies, you don't know what happened and why these zombies are there, but you know that in order to survive, you will need to explore, do a serie of quests, find food, water and shelter and craft weapons to defend yourself, all the usual ingredients that make a zombie survival game. Of course for veterans players it may lack deep, challenges, basic crafting system, maybe too easy overall but for new players it's a great way to get into the genre. The game is similar to fallout, with an RPG element as your character level up, you will have to make choices on how to spend your skill points. The graphics are nice, in my opinion, colorfull. (not diverse enough and can get boring after a while) the commands are precise making combats really efficient (maybe too much), at night new types of zombies, supposedly more aggresive (not really) will attack you but easely keep away with your torch or flashlight (which never runs out of battery). As you can see, there are good and bad about this game, you will like of hate, only you can decide.  I personaly enjoyed it, but i probably get bored after 10 hours into it. Co-op looks much more fun though.  My advice? Don't buy full price, wait for the sales.",

In How to Survive, you play one of three characters stranded on an island (or rather a small chain of islands) infested with zombies. There is far more to survival than just beating down the undead, though! You will need to eat food to keep your strength up, drink plenty of water to keep yourself energized, and lastly get plenty of sleep. Hunting and gathering plays a big part, as the both the fauna and the flora can provide you with precious sustenance. You can also fish.  And, of course, any competent survivalist has to be at least a little bit crafty. You will come across many useful materials which, with a little ingenuity, can be combined to create all manner of useful weapons and other tools. I really appreciate the game's relatively logical appraoch to this aspect - sure, there are blueprints scattered around the island(s) that will tell you exactly what to combine but you can figure out the majority of it on your own easily enough. For example, to make basic arrows for the bow all you need to do is combine a wooden branch with your machete. For a slight improvement, you can collect some feathers and add fletching. And so on. You can even create your own makeshift firearms.",

About the zombies, they can join their force to track you, no stealth or hidden in the bush instant, only action and evasion. Zombies spawn all the time and no place are cleared for ever.   The game does his duty, classic survival scenario, tons of kill (so far it is fun, no routine) and silly funny Kovac's rules movies!

Weapons are underpowered, health is somewhat limited and while you can craft armor you won't go tanking through levels which is nice. Even playing on Normal is a bit of a challenge. Crafting is simple enough and you can make some decent gear and healing supplies although I found i was carrrying tons of fruit, plants and mushrooms that i couldn't do anything with. The hunger/thirst/sleep mechanics gave the game some urgency, they aren't hard to keep topped off but you have to pay attention to them. Ranged combat is centered around the bow and arrow, you do have air powered firearms but the bow packs a whollop and the arrows are reusable. You have to decide when to use ammo and which guns to use, pistol type weapons do less dps but use far less ammo and you are able to recover more of it from dead z's, shotguns are streetsweepers but the ammo doesn't last. There's a varitey of critters to hunt if you need meat, hide, feathers or feel like killing, I rather enjoyed hunting the Tapirs.   Sttorage is limited and you'll have to do a lot of crafting to make room which was a bit annoying. I'm bad about picking everything up but very quickly the focus becomes item management which slows the action. Having a backpack full of things I can't yet craft sucks. Melee is difficult, you don't have much range and if you want to use charged attacks it takes quite some time leading to cheap hits. Having to clear safe houses is this games 'cresendo event' a la Left 4 Dead, it's exciting but feels cheap when large amounts of exploding z's spawn close to you. The controls aren't bad but when you've got a dozen z's after you it's ranged weapons or take a kicking. There are other people you interact with but just barely, you don't even get to answer yes/no it's all fetch quests. Not asking for a companion but it'd be nice to express opinions or ask for clarification, something to reward players that pay attention.   This is a fun game if you get it on sale, I've gotten some hours out of it but I'll likely put it down for now. I stayed away until now because the DLC looked like regular game features that had been cut out to create DLC. At $4 for the whole thing it's a good deal.",

The graphics in general are great and the scenery is gorgeous. The controls are generally good: having one stick to move and one to aim worked well. Time plays a big part of this game: things are harder in the night and the changes from day to night, and visa versa, are gradual and realistic.  The one negative thing about the game, far from a show-stopper, is a lack of polish in some respects. Some things just don't work how you'd expect them to.  All in all this game engrossed me and once you've completed the campaign other game modes, such as random mini-campaigns with perma-death, keep things entertaining.",

Now for the real review  It's a fun game at first look, it looks very survival-like and engaging and the combat looks fun (at first) So to say, the game is fun for a short while and then it's just the same thing over and over. They try to add new zombies (I.E. zombies with bullet proof helmets and jackets) but it mostly makes the combat more annoying.  Getting food, water, and sleep is not really an interesting factor, at least at the speed it drains. You'll find yourself hunting for a bunker plus food to eat and water to drink more often then you'll actually be progressing. Which leads me to the most important point  THERE IS NO BUILDING. I was very dissapointed to find that out. You cannot build anything, so if you want to sleep you have to find a bunker with a bed in it. And when you open said bunker, an alarm goes off and it calls a huge horde of zombies that most likely have helmets and jackets, which makes it no fun.  Why am I still rating it recomended? Because it was still fun in the beginning. It was worth the two dollars I paid, but I'd never recomend this at full price.  If you DO get the game, get it with friends.",

The co-op challenges can be fun with a friend.  Now lets get to the real review where we look at what they promised and what they delivered. The game is an ok size however it's extreamly limited in size for it's price.  If you forced yourself to go slow you would take maybe 6 hours to finish this game.  Another problem is the content the guns,melee weps, mutants ect is all really limiting. Some might disagree with me there but think about it theres maybe 8 guns, 3 chainsaws , 6 melee weps and 1 ammoless total op wep.  Now for my Largest disapointment with this game it's promise 'experience for zombie game veterans'  There is NOTHING veteran about this game it hands everything to you on a silver platter. There's sleep areas at night prebuilt impervise to any zombie attack that you only need to clear out once.  Night creatures are as deadly as a new born kitten. Ammo is WAY too common i had 2,000 ammo constantly.  There should never be a weapon that can destroy armys without some sort of price 'i'm looking at you boomarang' You should not point out on the map where the players have got to go.  The crafting tells you what's possible..... The 'hardest' mutant is the easyest thing to beat with a handgun.  Food is too easy to aquire. Water is Way too easy to aquire.  Items respawn..... Changing difficulty only changes what damage they hit.......  And i could go on with this list for acouple more pages. All in all this game was a disapointment and broke it's promises.  Before you say i did not play long enough know that i defeated the game twice and defeated half the challenges with friends. I played through twice to see if anything at all changed i really had to force myself to with a dieing hope that something hard or fun would of been added.  Update# Online co-op is lag and bug filled and has serious annoyances that i had hoped they might have removed. The difficulty and enemie numbers are the same. You and the other player are forced to share the screen meaning you can't move far from eachother. The match making system is pathetic as it's auto finding where you select options and hope that someone else has the same options but a diffrent character. All in all no real change to the game still not worth the money.",

            "review_text": "This is a very generic and low budget zombie survival game. The only unique mechanic that sets it apart is the ability to disassemble created items to their basic parts. It does not work on certain items, particularly advanced armor.   The rest of the game is low quality top down zombie shooting. Your field of view is very narrow so there is no sniping. The camera is also a fixed viewing angle which causes too many problems both from a player standpoint and a game design standpoint. However this is all moot because the actual playable area is very small. There are several islands which are all designed in basically the same way. Here is an example of some of the level design: Talk to NPC. NPC gives mission to find X item on Y island. Follow a winding path that features many areas to fall down or access previous areas of the level but only features one way forward. See barricade that is indestructible regardless of total damage done to it. Find a 'safe' house. Open door of 'safe' house and have a swarm of zombies attack on the area is clear of zombies. See campfire near safe house. Take route to find location near final destination. See another indescribable barricade. Visit objective. The indictable barricades can eventually be destroyed but only very late into the game. They basically serve as walls until destroyed and then they become massive shortcuts.   The survival aspect is pitiful. You have four status bars to keep track of: Health, Hunger, Thirst, and Tiredness. They are easily taken care of and really only serve as a nuisance to take up backpack space. Uncooked meals kill you. Cook meals increase the hunger bar's fullness and occasionally heal a small amount. They never go bad and there are only two basic ingredients that are edible, raw meat which comes from any animal and special white plant which is found in various locations. It is possible to carry water but there are so many sources of water (expect rain) you'll never have to worry about it.   Combat is heavily biased towards guns. There are almost no melee recipes but there are gun recipes. Ammo is abundant and all guns use the same ammo. Bows are basically handguns and every gun is a fully automatic that at worst rapidly pumps ammo but is lethal at close range. The greatest gun I could create at 'high' for every state, including accuracy, so I could actually aim at enemies off screen and kill in one hit. But really the best weapon of all is the tri-blade boomerang with spikes. Take a melee blade and combine it with a bone. Now you have a sharpened bone. Combine two sharpened bones. Then combine a third. Then combine a piece of flint. You can add the flint with just two bone blades.  This is basically the best weapon you can have. It hits multiple zombies, it is incredibly fast, and best of all it doesn't require blueprints.  Which leads to the biggest failure of this game. The crafting system isn't based on experimentation and it has a terrible UI. For the UI you click on an item, see if the combine item is there, click combine and see if you have another item that can be combined with. But you need recipes for many of the items in order to make them. Most of the time you can't just combine two random items and see what happens. During the first bits of the game yes you can and the amazing tri-blade boomerang can be made at this stage but later in the game you'll simply be finding recipes for items that you could have made with ingredients you found hours ago that were useless. Also the crafting is additionally resctricted by a player's level and unlocked skills. So even though you'll unlock the recipe for fire arrows pretty quickly unless you spend the point to make them you won't be able to. Luckily you can at least use items that you haven't unlocked a skill or blueprint for. Just don't uncombine it.  The skill tree is a joke. The player characters have slightly different stats but it doesn't matter. Even though I choose the character with the lowest stamina and accuracy I was easily able to shoot or run away. I died a few times but mostly boss deaths or zombie-animal attacks which who will charge you rapidly and suicidally.   The only part of the game that I was impressed with was the standoff in the mist. Rain is occasionally used as a weather effect but only during a final stand is an effect used to really change up gameplay. The mist moves which creates a realistic affect of obscuring sight and requiring character reaction. The massive amount of hidden zombies actually creates a sense of panic. Unfortunately one exciting part of a game is not enough to redeem it. The quirky survival manual voice overs are really the only positive thing I've taken away from this game.",

I consider myself relatively conservative when it comes to spending MONEY (not talking politics), and after playing this, I could have just thrown $15 in a public toilet and flushed it, and it would evoke the same feelings.

Combat: If you prefer a challenge, do not build the boomerangs. The boomerangs are too OP (overpowered). Once i got the triple-bladed boomerangs, none of the zombies were a challenge for me.  Crafting: Obtaining the items are easy, keeping them till you are able to craft them is hard. I mean, who wants to fill up your inventory with items you probaly don't need til you find that last piece that you need? I tried putting the crafting items in the safehouses, but i soon forgot where i placed them.  Others: Managing thirst, hunger and fatigue is too easy. Water is easily found. As for food, i placed a skill point in hunting and the animals are mapped out for me. Fatigue is solved by safehouses which litter the various islands.

Turning it into a hack/slash RPG with crafting all the hardware you can use to escape a Caribbean zombie nightmare. There's some great voice acting in this game, and the combat is top notch.  On the other hand.....  This game is known to crash on me. A lot. Seriously, I know this is only a fifteen dollar game, but the programmers really need to get off their asses and start patching this. The game also can't seem to make up its mind whether it wants to be mildly challenging or European-Extreme. While that does have a interesting way of keeping me on my toes, many parts of the game just feel downright mean-spirited in design. Two examples I can think of off the top of my head is a boss battle that takes place on a beach about halfway through the game. I ran into this guy, many of my reserves were depleted from hordes of zombies before, and night was just starting to fall, meaning you also get the weird mutant gremlins hounding you every few seconds. Now who knows, it could just be I just had really crappy luck, since the battle could have gone very differently depending on various factors. However, there's another part much later, where you're trying to retrieve some airplane cargo that's been scattered through a swamp. You'll sometimes run into gangs of piranha in these area, and they are completely unkillable. I even tried using the electric gun, which in all rights SHOULD be able to kill them. Your mobility is sapped when you're in the swamp, which makes it very easy for the fish to catch up to you. Many of the islands in the swamp can only be climbed on from certain sides, and you have to sprint all the way around while the piranha are ripping you to pieces, and they work much more quickly than you do. Oh, and the map didn't offer any safe or easily defined routes through the swamp. Also it eventually started spawning me IN the water, right next to my hungry friends. Suffice it to say, this was about the time where the game overstepped its bounds and I stopped. I'm not one to complain about a hearty challenge, but the designers don't seem to get that there's a pretty huge difference between a fierce but functional challenge, and unplayable garbage. I went into this really wanting to make it all the way though, and it really breaks my heart that I can't readily recommend this to anyone.  Sorry Kovac. You just can't survive poor game design. It was fun while it lasted, though.",

Also, the game's tendency to replace items in the quick use bar without user input means you can have a health poultice ready to use, spend the next half hour gathering compmponents for a molotov to pass a necessary barrier, kill a boss and go to use your poultice afterwards and end up throwing your bomb at the boss's corpse effectively negating the last half hour's work.  And finally, I could find no settings that would allow me to open up and review blueprints after I had picked them up so I could keep an eye out for the necessary components. It may be in there somewhere, but, if so, it's obviously not intuitive, which means it's a bad game design.  The game runs smoothly and the mechanics of gameplay are well done, but the lack of factors outside the game like real life interruptions and an inuitive control system makes this a game not worth playing.

You can only move in 8 directions, and you cannot change your direction of motion when dodging, which can easily get you into unwanted situations, especially when you are chased by a horde. Combat with keyboard and mouse feels strange. When you walk, you face the direction of your motion, but when you raise your weapon you face where your mouse is pointing. This makes sense for ranged weapons as you have to take aim, but is quite confusing in melee combat. Walls don't become transparent when you are behind it. And if there's a zombie, you'll just lose health without knowing in which direction you should wield your blade.  The idea of the game is interesting - this is why it have stayed on my wishlist for some time, but now I feel good for myself because I waited long enough for a sale, bought it with 4 bucks, and didn't waste more money.",

The journals added character and atmosphere, and the voice acting was fine. Combat was nothing to write home about, but it wasn't awful either.  Nothing really made the game into a hidden gem or elevated it beyond most other zombie-survival-crafting games, as far as I could tell. It was short, the story was trite and predictable, and none of the things it did well were so good that I was wow'ed.   How to Survive is sort of interesting, and is probably worth picking up on sale, but I can't say it's a must have. I'm mostly left feeling like if you asked me whether or not to buy it in person I'd shrug and say 'I guess?'",

The game it self is really nice, but the port to PC is one of the worst ever. It is so bad that the experience of using the UI and the in-game menu makes me want to rage. The inventory can't be sorted (god I want to have weapon next to each other and ammo next to eachother),  You cant move items around in your inventory with your mouse. Would be really nice to have buttons for type of items so you can 'unmark' weapons/ammo to lessen the 'clutter'. There is no quick equip and no key bindings for equipment so you have to keep pausing the game to change between gear. That breaks up the momentum in the game and that will make the game feel less fun instead of giving you a 'survivel' experiance, And you can only use the mouse to equip gear (stop the game, push the item you want to quip, now move the mouse down to 'equip'). You cant change between 'menu folders' like skill/inventory/stats/journal without using the mouse, there is no key-binding for the different 'folders', wtf why??? It is good and nice to have a mouse supported menu, but a mouse support ONLY menu? For crying out loud, make it support a keyboard too. There is no 'video/grafics' menu. Just like a mobile game. Sure, this game does not need much of an video menu, but it would be nice to be able to change between 'window mode/fullscreen windowed/fullscreen'. It is a NIGTHMARE to play on a multimonitor setup as the mouse keep moving outside the screen. If you are unlucky and lick, the game minimizes.   This is pure LAZYNES AND GREED!!!!   If you could make mods for the game, it would be SO much better. Someone could then fixe the problems that the PC verson has.  I really want to give it the thumbs up, but do to the lazy port I will give it a thumbs down.",

The top-down view and navigation are very annoying at times with trees blocking your view.   The biggest issue I have with this game is the item menu. I wish I could use the WASD keys for menu navigation, and maybe the spacebar or enter keys to confirm. I honestly don't know if I can use the arrow keys for the item menu. Actually, I don't know if you can use the arrow keys to move the character. But you can only cancel with Esc key, and use/combine/drop with the mouse. Using the mouse for just about everything was tiresome, dull, and time consuming mostly during combining items. Very inefficient. My patience was already at its limit 1.7 hours in.  The problem I have with the audio is a very minor issue; but, I still feel I have to include it: the music volume is obnoxiously loud to the point I had to set it incredibly low to match the voice and sound effect volumes, which were set very high.

Graphics are good enough, and the game looks pretty well at 5760 x 1080 BUT play mechanics suck, you cannot rotate the view, interaction is a matter of luck, half the stuff I found and picked up was by sheer luck. You have to use keyboard for movement, no running around and bashing zombies with a mouse. It really felt like an unfinished game which isn’t always bad when in Alpha stage but this is “finished game”. I played Alpha games before and they had me come back for more but this game did not managed to pull me in. As to the story and content can’t say too much because after I died the first time I had no intentions of trying again (check point save system doesn’t help) and uninstalled it lol so that’s that.",

            "review_text": "How to Survive has some good elements, but it loses itself in poor design and implementation. There's some excitement as you begin the game. You learn to fight the zombies and begin crafting your first few items. The game introduces you to the different elements at a pace that allows you to pick them up fluently. The crafting system offers interesting potential for exploration and discovery. Lets look at where it all goes wrong.  The fighting: Ultimately repetitive and boring. You can play on Normal with no trouble, and ramping up the difficulty creates only a manufactured challenge. As others have noted, your choice of weapon is your most reliable indicator of how well you'll do. There's no real strategy to the game. Zombies also respawn almost instantly so you can't clear out an area. Simply walk back through the area you just cleared, and you'll find everyone back again. The combat is halfway between Crimsonland and an actual shooter, but it never decides which one it wants to be.  Crafting is interesting until you realize most items do exactly the same thing. There's also little indication of what you've made in many cases. Sometimes you can combine a couple of items only to find that absolutely nothing happened, but one of the items is still gone. You can also create different versions of the same item. There's no database of items you've crafted, and there's no creativity to the crafting. This doesn't even approach something like Terraria. It's like an action RPG split the items into pieces and forced you to put them together. Furthermore your inventory is abysmally small, and there are no other storage spaces in the game. You will find yourself being forced to drop items you have no idea whether you'll need later with equally little idea if they'll even remain where you dropped them. Rare items often don't matter as some are almost impossible to find but have nothing particularly special about them.  The actual survival system, though introduced at a nice pace, is boring. There's no strategy to eating, drinking and sleeping. Food just takes up inventory space. Water requires bottling it or traveling to a well on the island. The islands themselves are almost completely linear with no actual room for exploration. There's nothing to discover. Everything was put in a specific spot where you're meant to encounter it, yet there are few scripted events. There's not much driving you onward in the linear progression other than some MMO-style fetch quests in a few events that could barely be called a storyline.  Even with all that, what really killed it for me is the save system. It's abysmal. There are 'checkpoints' that I can't figure out how they're determined. It seems to autosave on a timer without telling you. However those autosaves are not saved if you quit the game. You have to encounter a 'real' save point for the game to actually bother keeping your progress. So you can unwittingly quit the game thinking it will maintain your last checkpoint and lose more than half an hour of progress. None of it was interesting enough to want to repeat. The saves either occur at completion of the fetch quests or at safe-houses.   The safe houses are anything but safe. They're riddled with zombies and auto-spawn three times as many when you reach them. After clearing them out, they'll still spawn zombies outside them. There's no storage bin or anything personalized. They're the only place you can sleep. There's only one per island, and they're always located somewhere at the peak of a linear maze of corridors. However there's a 'save' button on the wall. It's the only other way to save your game outside of completing quests. If you want to take a break from playing, better keep the game running.  Overall there are some good ideas at the heart of this. Any of them with more focus and polish could have theoretically been a good game. Perhaps a top-down shooter with zombies or a post-apocalyptic crafting game. As it stands, the game is split between too many unpolished elements and doesn't shine in any particular area. It quickly becomes a chore to play. Finally, the fact that there's a lot of DLC, most of which are obvious basic game features and not developed expansion packs, is a disgusting way of raising the price of the game. Not recommended.",

            "review_text": "The game is pretty fun for what it is. It isn't an expensive game, so I understand certain limitations and certain bugs, but frankly, I have NEVER once had any problems with any game's stability. I am writing this after 12 crashes spread across a couple nights. This includes 4 different completely random video driver crashes, 2 crashes that killed OBS along with it, 3 crashes related to it not being in full screen, 2 random inexplicable times it has suddenly seized up and crashed out, and 1 connection DC even though a personal Team Speak server, OBS, and even the unholy disconnection king known as Twitch have all had 100% stable running connections.  We lost stacks of items regularly due to stacking glitches, my fully upgraded boomerang sailed off into the sea never to be seen again simply because I got pulled into a dialog when my co-op player talked to someone, there are invisible walls everywhere that I kept getting caught on unknown to me until I suddenly teleported back to where I was caught and where I was being killed by mobs, and lastly, there were a few times where freaking water-bound pirahnas were relentlessly chasing us ON LAND. There was also a constant beyond uncountable number of times when we got stuck 'waiting for other player' when there was no reason at all to be waiting for anything.  I get that games have bugs and that things go wrong. My career path is in IT and as a system administrator, so its not as if I'm inept at dealing with this type of situation. So far through multiple alpha and beta tests my system has never had nearly as many problems as it has with this game. These problems or lack of them also wildly differed between significantly similar equipment and configurations. (1st Gen Intel i7 940 OC'd vs 1st Gen Intel i7 940 OC'd, 24GB tripple channel 1600 GSkill RAM vs 16GB dual channel 1600 GSkill RAM, NVIDIA 560TI vs NVIDIA 550TI, WD Caviar Black + Intel 520 SSD vs dual WD Caviar Black, etc. You get the point that they are really similar.)  I hate to give it an unfavorable review, but it has been severely unstable and buggy, and its getting worse the longer I play it.  This review is even more disheartening to write because the game itself is incredibly endearing in a really goofy and entertaining way that makes me really want to look past the problems. Slaughtering mobs with different weapons and in different manners is an absolute gas (molotovs, flame throwers, and beat down weapons are a hoot), and you can't just 'have all the things' which means there is some gravity in what you chose to take and leave behind due to limited inventory. You have to actually pick and chose what you really want, although this is slightly negated by the fact that you can always go back for items, and that you can only make certain things with specific predetermined patterns and with significantly limited upgrade options. (Frankly, think Vanilla Minecraft simple but with more steps as far as crafting complexity goes.) Some weapons completely suck, and others will make you laugh while comically wrecking dozens of zombies faces at a time.  The Kovac's Rules videos were also greatly entertaining (despite their nasty habit of ignoring your volume settings) and I found myself greatly enjoying the constant hunt for more stuff and looking forward to finding out what the story of the islands was and what the next Kovac's Rules was about.  Ultimately, the game has a lot of promise, it is a unique and enjoyable game, but it's just REALLY frusterating dealing with the problems, bugs, crashes, design quirks and limitations, flaky co-op, and miriade of other issues that detract from actually digging in and playing the game. If you are one that the problems happen for, it will inevitably at some point force you to just give up on it.",
