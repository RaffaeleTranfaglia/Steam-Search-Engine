            "review_text": "I have never written a review before as I've never felt the need. Now I just really wish I'd read one or two before this lacklustre and seriously flawed game. The producers should be ashamed. I imagine that the developers who ported it to the PC must spend a lot of time pretending they had nothing to do with it. I doubt they could bear the embarrassment - better and more honest to admit to poor personal hygiene I would imagine.  As a seasoned gamer since 1981 and having recently finished the latest instalments of Bioshock, Thief, Tomb Raider, Dishonoured, Metro Redux (2033 and Last Light - both excellent games) and Deus Ex: Human Revolution (The Director's Cut), unwittingly I fell into the trap of thinking that this recently released game would bear some of the hallmarks of the above titles. Unfortunately I couldn't have been more wrong - a view borne out by reading user reviews (sadly after buying the game) - all of which seemed to emphasise that a port from a tablet or phone hasn't really worked in this case. The keys can now be customised to (say) make 'SPACE' = USE ITEM. All fine except on-screen in the game, it says something like 'Press 'F' to USE ITEM' - i.e. the customisations don't carry through into the on-screen dialogue or tutorial which does make it a bit confusing and liable to get you killed or stuck in one place as you frantically search your keyboard for the move forward command. Graphically it's okay but reminiscent of a game 10+ years ago. Most of the time, the movement is clunky and the keys fail to respond. Even on the first level, the number of bugs was enough to make me just delete the game. I'd delete it at four times the price; it's that bad. Imagine opening a door in the game, the door opens, you turn around to go back and it asks you to open the visibly open door - and won't let you go through until you go through the pretence of 'opening' the door. The range of keys that can be used is ridiculous - at one point I was thinking of bringing my nose into play to perform the complicated manoeuvre of jumping over a low box. First I had to 'break cover' - very hard to do when you've got to press two keys and they're not the ones being stated on the screen that you must press. The you have to press up to the low box and then finally press 'Use' (or it may have been Inventory' or 'Map' - no idea in the end. There is no 'JUMP' button unlike in Human Revolution which manages to get along with considerably less keys to press and confuse. As for using my nose as an extra digit, I have a cold and couldn't face the mess.  I'd say that words fail me but actually they don't. It's polite words that I'm having a degree of difficulty with. Of all the games in all the bars, this one sucks the most.   From this 'Does it have the X-factor' judge, it's a big no. This game has 'FALL'en at the first hurdle (see what I did there?), leaving human kind to fend for itself - and it'll be glad it did!",

            "review_text": "I had read a bunch of god-awful reviews about this game before finally finding the courage to dish a few Euros out for it. Perhaps the fact that I was expecting an unplayable mess let me enjoy it more than I should have. Or maybe my tolerance for crap has increased manifold since I last had it checked. Either way, The Fall felt like a stripped down, flatter version of Human Revolution - and having said that, it didn't feel unplayable at all.  What the rest of the review talks about:  + visually faithful to the previous games + good potential for exploration + a short story in the Deus Ex universe  +/- easier and (more) relaxing to play as sleuth +/- few familiar characters  - poor UI adaptation and game mechanics - some obvious glitches - no real boss fights  Admitting that I am a huge fan of Deus Ex, I enjoyed doing all the stuff I did in the main game: hacking, sleuthing, taking down anything that moves on the map in the most Ghandi-esque manner possible. The main quest is supported by five side-quests, the map is structured in three large areas with several buildings accessible in each and the environments are all very familiar if you've played Human Revolution. It is absolutely a retread of the original and took me about six hours to complete, while eliminating all AI enemies.   So I can understand why someone who doesn't have the patience to go through this level of time-wrapping and wishes for something new and original in the Deus Ex universe will be disappointed. Although conceived like the Missing Link, this port is inferior in its execution and obvious bugs arise that smack of superficiality from the developers. Most if not all the ones I encountered were just glitches though and did not pose any software farts. Storywise, only a few familiar characters appear with minimal roles and there are no real boss fights to talk about. What compounds the bad word of mouth for any new player will be the irritating tutorial which introduces you to the world and the slightly altered game mechanics and controls, which are simplified compared to the original. Oh, and the messy interface too.   But these seemed mostly trivial obstacles to me, none of which were deal-breakers. The game, while quick and dirty in a sense, allowed me to roam across the map and do things at my own pace, with few restrictions controlling story elements. I feel I paid a fair (discounted) price for a minor entry in the Deus Ex universe and was able to enjoy the hours spent playing it. So I would go out on a limb and recommend it to fans of the series who have a sense of lenience and patience about themselves.",

            "review_text": "Noodling around Deus Ex land one more time was fun. Sneaking, evading guards, the Human Revolution hacking mini-game - at times Deus Ex: The Fall felt like the real thing - but honestly, as a PC title it's a joke. The gameplay is Junior's first Deus Ex adventure, and user interface, textures, tiny maps, single save game slot, disappearing bodies, non-rebindable keys all remind you: this is not a port of a mobile game,  this is a mobile game .  And the bugs... Configure your speakers in Windows to Stereo or voices won't play, with subtitles only appearing for a fraction of a second. And there were severe mouse issues - sometimes I would try to open a door, but had to click the 'hack' button several times before the game noticed. Also choosing the correct NPC for dialogue was a mini-game itself - how do I position myself to speak with  that  one? - with the bonus hazard of a container or door sometimes conspiring to steal my selection.  Wouldn't be fair to comment on the shooty bits, since I always sneak around pacifist style in these games. Maybe it's great, maybe it's garbage, but for Deus Ex, who cares? If you are looking for FPS action, headshots, running around the map like Rambo, you bought the wrong game. :)  So I've scoured the map for side quests, rummaged through every bin, spoken to every NPC I could find. Guess it's safe to move to the next hub. So I get to the choppa, a cutscene plays, 'TO BE CONTINUED' appears and I discover I've completed the entire game. Oh, right, $10.  If you're a huge Deus Ex fan, and/or you have a good imagination maybe it's worth that price. Otherwise I would call this a classic 'wait for a 75% discount' situation.  p.s. For one fanboy mini-letdown I couldn't find the original Deus Ex main title playing anywhere. :(  Edit: It's not the worst  game  I've played, only the worst  Deus Ex game  I've played. :)  I had fun with parts of The Fall; wouldn't have finished the game if I didn't enjoy  any  of it. But I enjoyed the feeling of being in the Deus Ex world more than the actual game I was playing - if that makes any sense.   If you loved the previous Deus Ex games and want more of that world, this is as close as you're going to get. Stealthy gameplay in a science fiction near-future, shadowy government/corporate conspiracies, sounds great! But none of that happens in Deus Ex: The Fall - it's just your imagination filling in the gaps in the barren in-game world.  Deus Ex: The Fall feels like an outline, or a rough draft, the bare skeleton of a Deus Ex game. You can crouch, sneak, read notes, crawl through the vents, knock out the guards. But it's all so  small . There's no depth, no moral ambiguity, no double-cross, no surprise. No huge map where you explore, scout out the opposition, make plans, maybe fail and try again from a different direction. You see a guard, you see a vent, you crawl behind the guard, you knock him out. Then his body disappears. Repeat until you run out of guards.  If you've never played the original year-2000 Deus Ex, I recommend playing that game instead. It's ancient by video game standards, and looks it, but it puts Deus Ex: The Fall to shame. The last time I played was with a mod called 'New Vision' which greatly improves the graphics but leaves the underlying game alone. There may be other mods available by now, I haven't kept track so you will have to research that yourself. :)",

You take the role of Ben Saxon and his beef with Belltower, because much like it's real world counter part (Blackwater) they've done some shady stuff outside of the human trafficing that was shown in the Missing Link DLC.  All in all I would really recommend this game if you really love the Deus Ex lore and it's web of conspiracies and rabbit holes. Gameplay is a bit stripped down but surprisingly intact for a Mobile port. Get it while it's cheap!  I do hope that they continue the series, I beat it under 3 hours but if you take your time you can do it in 6.  ",

            "review_text": "I never thought I'd give a negative review to a Deus Ex game but The Fall is terrible! I played Human Revolution first by accident, and all the flaws in The Fall have been fixed there so seeing things that are so familiar, but just don't work, is very disorienting. The Fall even looks incredibly like HR, but nothing works like it does in HR. Don't waste your time with The Fall, move straight on to the vastly superior Human Revolution!  I'm going to just list the problems: - There are no separate save games!! Seriously, there is a single save and if it auto-saves after you saved manually, well, tough cookies for you. - One power cell that recharges - that's enough to take down a single person. - The inventory is a disaster - not only is it not an actual inventory with space allocation, your inventory shares space with a shop where you can just buy stuff, instead of finding it in the world. Very confusing and sometimes you pick up an item but it doesn't seem to be available in your inventory. One of the most thought-provoking things in Deus Ex was always figuring out what to keep and what to drop, to make the best use of your limited inventory space. A wrong choice spelled disaster. Being able to just buy anything, with apparently unlimited space, just sucks the fun out of the entire concept. It's a jumble of what you actually have and what you can buy. - Control allocation - I've been playing for 5 hours and I still have no idea how to access half the so-called shortcuts. The original Deus Ex introduced the easy-to-use 1 through 0 button allocation where you could drag weapons etc into the slots accordingly. If it ain't broke, don't fix it! They removed something that was incredibly simple to use and replaced it with confusing nonsense. Half the time I'm lucky to find the right gun. - Wow, the tutorials are appallingly bad. Not only are they delivered in this grim monotone, you get a single blurry picture to explain how to do whatever. In the beginning, the game actually freezes until you follow the instruction... if you can figure out what it actually wants you to do! - Whether you kill or knock unconscious, bodies disintegrate. No bodies to alarm guards that must be disposed of, they just disappear. Which is linked to the ridiculously bad AI which decides you've left the area, even if the guards saw you twenty seconds ago, hiding behind a wall. - You can't jump or throw things. Seriously, not at all. It sucks. - The zones are tiny and terrible which require multiple area transitions to get anywhere - not even exaggerating, at least 4 to go anywhere. - Hacking consoles (at least 80% of them) cannot zoom out correctly, so you can't hack it because you can't even see the nodes! - The character of Ben is just terrible, and Anna is actually worse. The story's thin and not remotely interesting. - Final nail in the coffin - took 7 hours to complete AND ended on 'To Be Continued'. What a waste of time.  This game basically took everything that worked perfectly and threw it all out the window... and everything they changed gets changed back for Human Revolution, and then gets improved.  I may as well finish it since I paid for it, but it is incredibly bad. Seriously, stop reading this and go play Human Revolution instead, it's really great.",

I know it's supposed to be episodic, but for a Deus Ex game, 4 hours really isn't enough to expand on anything. It's almost like a Deus Ex demo, because all other three games were so long and had so much stuff to do.  Length shouldn't bother too many people, but everything else will. The game has been made insultingly easy. You have an in-game menu that allows you to buy anything you want. Seriously. It makes the game so easy because you can stop at any time to buy yourself a new gun or some ammo. There are not multiple paths through things anymore. There's usually one or two ways to approach something, no matter what it is. The graphics smell like mobile port, but that's because it IS a mobile port. Many models look very ugly. The voice acting for the main character is not great either.  All in all, there's really not much to enjoy.

To me, the game looks like a cheap console port. The enemies move like stick puppets, and the character models look lifeless and 'off'. After being disappointed by the graphics, I thought it might be due to low quality settings, but no.  There are no graphics quality settings except for anti-aliasing.   Voice-acting:  Bad. The voice actors deliver their lines without any passion. At times, it feels like the game is voiced by a text-to-speech engine like Siri (or Cortana), although I'm sure they would actually do a better job. The voiced-over tutorial is especially dreadful, but can fortunately be skipped.   Gameplay:  Little challenge. The game features an ingame menu which includes all augmentation upgrade options as well as weapon and item stores. Meaning you can pause the game and purchase upgrades, new weapons and ammo in the middle of a fight, which pretty much ruins any sense of immersion for me.   Quality:  Bugged. In the first 3 chapters, I've reliably fallen through the floor (into death) at a certain point, had camera moves that move the viewpoint behind a wall and seen takedown animations that leave both me and the unconscious guard at another place than the takedown actually happened.   Summary:  Don't buy this if you like the Deus Ex series, you'll just end up disappointed.",

            "review_text": "Before i begin, let me say that the game as it is right now has several issues, including a bug with vsync that makes the game unplayable with broken mouse controls and recoil. If you have seen TotalBiscuit's WTF is... video you'd know what i'm talking about (note that TB didn't notice that this is caused from vsync). The workaround is to enable vsync, but this introduces input lag. The developers should fix this ASAP. But in hopes that they do, i'm going to ignore that for now.   Now about the game. AFAIK story-wise this is supposed to be the sequel of a book (Icarus Effect), which itself was a prequel to the story of Deus Ex: Human Revolution. Sadly the game doesn't seem to make much of a introduction to this and for the first hour or so you will feel disconnected from the characters since it starts assuming that you already know them. Personally i had never read the book (i actually didn't knew about it, but now i will try and get it) so it took me a while to get any attachment with the characters. As the game began i didn't knew why i should care about the main character, especially considering his background. The fact that the game seems to ignore some parts of the book didn't help either (at least according to people who have read it). Fortunately after a while, once you start figuring out what the actual story of the game is all about (which happens about when you meet the crook doctor, a few moments after TB decided to stop playing the game, if you watched that video) both the characters and story start to pick up and become interesting.  The game's visuals are ok, they remind me of some early 2000s games. The environments are good to look at, although if you have a large monitor you'll certainly notice the low texture resolution and the bad tiling in a few of them doesn't help either. Still, as far as environments go, they are nice to look at and remind of lower fidelity version of HR's environments. The worse parts IMO are the character models: they look attrocious, especially the heads of the woman junkies which are all over the place. The lighting on them equeally bad, as if someone didn't knew about smoothing groups in 3ds max or whatever modelling program they used and there doesn't seem to be enough animations for all the character actions (f.e. at several points the enemies will try to strafe left and right but there isn't any animation for that so they just slide with their feet motionless). The only good model is the one of the pilot you'll meet near the end, but even that looks like a bad copy of Faridah Malik (and apparently in the Deus Ex:HR universe all pilots must have a mole :-P). But if you can ignore the bad character modelling, the game looks fine. Technically it is quite simple, but as a theme the visuals work fine.  The best part IMO is the sound - the guns sound good and the music is really good. At a couple of places i just stopped playing for a while to listen to the background music. Most of it sounds like a remixed version of HR's music (which i suppose it is) but i think there are a couple of original scores as well.  Sadly, following the bad modelling the game also has bad voice acting with hilariously awful accents. The only good audio come from the TV broadcaster Eliza, which i assume uses the same voice actor as HR. The writing doesn't help either since in many cases you'll be left wondering why the writers thought that a specific line was a good idea.  The gameplay is basically a simplified version of HR's gameplay. You still have the hacking, shooting, sneaking, etc as HR and the original game, but the RPG elements are mostly removed beyond a very simplistic upgrade system (which most of the time isn't needed, except in a couple of areas where you have to use a specific augmentation). Also you can upgrade guns, but i didn't notice that, never needed it and finally decided to try it out almost at the end of the game but even after upgrading a gun to the maximum settings it didn't made much of a difference. Also there is an in-game shop where you get to buy stuff with in-game currency that you gain by doing stuff. I suspect that on iOS this was tied to IAP because the shop is available at any point (not just to some vendor or whatever like in HR) and contains almost everything you may want, including even a kit that brings you back to life when you die. This makes the game much easier, although the most interesting items are expensive enough so that you don't get them instantly. Still, it removes the tension from small things like running out of bullets (since the price of the bullets is very low).  The level design is ok, but for the first few levels it is quite linear. The interesting levels begin at the slums, where you start getting alternative routes and more areas to explore (incintentally this is where TB stopped playing). Up to that point it was mostly linear and played more like a tutorial than the real game. I think the devs thought nobody would have played HR so they wanted to reintroduce the gameplay - and did it in the worst way possible, by destroying most first impressions and filling the first few moments with awful tutorial panels with one of the most obnoxious voices you'll hear in a tutorial. The game however becomes even more interesting in the later stages like in the hotel.  Wrapping it up (and because i got bored typing this :-P), i think that there is a good game in there that tries to come out and the story is interesting, but the way it is told and the presentation (as far as animation and character models go at least) isn't up to the task. I don't recommend it for the full price, especially considering the bugs that the game has, but i would recommend it if the bugs were fixed and the price was halved. It does have some interesting moments and does provide some story to the Deus Ex universe that seems to fit in, so it has that going for it. Also the gameplay, even if simplistic, can be enjoyable - if you can overlook the first hour or so.  I'm not generally recommending this game unless you are a fan of Deus Ex that is curious to see what this has to offer (and again, i'd recommend to wait for a price drop). If the bugs are fixed and the price is dropped, i may change my recommendation to Yes, but even then be cautious about the other issues that the game has and mentioned above.",

Given that I have two monitors (who doesn't have at least that many?), this neatly spans the gap between them. It does only play in a window (no full-screen mode) At least I can move the window ...  The story-line is driven by frequent video clips and lengthy dialog which, whilst well done, disrupts game flow. At least much of it can be skipped, at the expense of passing up on all of the background information. The graphics look poor and lack the quality and crispness of DX3. Often I'd find that, whilst turning, the display would freeze for a few frames, then suddenly jump. The vents in particular look clunky and really stand out. Finding a vent or secret path no longer evokes a sense of pride, but more that of inevitability, with the majority being highly predictable. The origin of the game in paid-for content is still evident with the 'marketplace' - an always-accessible page to purchase any of the game's weapons, ammo, weapon mods, items or bundles thereof.  There is no restriction on the availability of any of these, making firepower solely a function of money. Talking of which, money never seemed to be in short supply - in part because I was always able to wait until the last moment before buying any gear I might need. Praxis points/augmentation upgrades again came thick and fast, removing the sense of satisfaction in the early parts of DX1 and DX3 of navigating a difficult situation through skill rather than technology. The controls further the departure from PC-centric to console-like key combinations. Quick slots allow you to pick which item/grenade or aug to use, but don't actually invoke them - that's another keypress. Mission difficulty can't be set. Instead, you play the whole mission at the easiest setting and then you get the option to replay the entire mission with your accumulated wealth, equipment and augs. Talking of missions, there is only one.  The initial tutorial in Moscow is so linear and driven by the tutorial that you might as well be a drone doing as you're told. The tutorial constantly demands the user to use both keyboard and mouse to navigate through it. The only real mission takes place in Panama, and has a handful of side quests.  I'd cry if I hadn't been here before. As DX2 was to DX1, so is Deus Ex: The fall to DX3. I can only hope that Square Enix actually make a decision about whether they're trying to write a console or PC game, and go with it. There is so much potential in the DX world, and even The Fall has potential and some good basic plot-lines, but at the moment that potential is not being realised.  John",

I can perfectly comprehend why many (non-trash-loving) people would be angry about The Fall; the graphics are somewhere around Quake 3-level (yes, that's a game from 1999), the level design makes absolutely no sense, the AI is as intelligent as a piece of burnt toast, the quality of the voice actors ranges somewhere between okay-ish and awful, and you can just feel that it is a half-hearted port of a mobile game - to name just a few points.

If it goes on sale or you see it in a Humble Bundle, like I did, then I suggest you pick it up if you are interested. Avoid it as long as the price tag is above $5.00 USD though - that's the most I'd recommend spending on this game.",

However, I think this game is still recomendable for those of us die-hard Deus Ex fans. Although a much shorter (and simpler) game, it's still, in my opinion, a good game.  The graphics are inferior to those of Human Revolution, but that should be obvious, considering that this game originated as a mobile game. Even then, they managed to capture the aesthetic of HR, with all its golden glory. As far as the environment goes, the city of Panama is an interesting location to explore, although it's much smaller in scale than the hubs of DEHR.  The gameplay is also simplified. You don't need to search around for people to buy guns and/or Praxis kits from; you can do it whenever you please from the pause menu, and you also can't sell your weapons (but it doesn't matter, as money and bought weapons carry over to new playthroughs). The AI feels a bit dumb, as they'll quickly lose interest in you if you stay under cover for a short time; add to that the fact that bodies dissappear, and it makes for a much more 'casual' Deus Ex experience. Even then, it's enjoyable.  Finally, the story, in my opinion, is worthy of a Deus Ex game. It already starts with the main character trying to uncover a conspiracy, only to find about an even bigger conspiracy, and getting involved in it. The only downside, though, is that it ends on a cliffhanger. It seems that they intended to make this game episodic, but they abandoned that idea (probably due to the bad reception it got).  Still, it's worth a shot in my opinion, I recommend it.",

One thing that people are missing is that this IS the conversion so you cannot expect miracles, but you also have to take into consideration, that the price is not as high as for standard games. I haven't also encountered any bugs during gameplay and everything went smoothly. If you love deus ex universe, good story, cyberpunk or stealth action this is the right choice. Games are about fun, not the lower graphics or the necessary simplifiations thanks to the conversion.",

No choices because lethal or not enemies vanish with NPCs acting like you killed them, and all dialogue leads the same route. The environments are completely exploitable with poor design decisions and the AI is nonsensical. Giving a pass of the hilariously awful models due to it being a port of mobile game, the game still has an odd aliasing effect even with 8XAA. The port is awful and won't even let you rebind any of the controls, which is hilarious because the default one the game uses is putrid. As to be expected it is also filled with so much bugs you could swear the game was unfinished, which oddly enough is how it plays. You only have one save slot though so use it well.  To make it all worse is that the story and characters are a bore and aren't even worth a read on the Deus Ex wiki, let alone to playthrough this game.  I give credit were it is due though, just when I thought the game couldn't possibly ♥♥♥♥ on the Deus Ex name any further it goes all out completely drops the ball at the end.

The voice acting is fine except when its on an pad that takes an hour to play out, with long pauses so you keep walking away from it thinking its done. The sound for it also doesnt follow you and it gets quieter as you walk away from it.  There is NO jump funtion, and the cover function is terrible. It bugs out, flips your mouse around when you get close to walls, and is both unresponsive at times and not satisfying in the best of times.

There are jarring glitches such as when you do a melee takedown on someone whilst you are in cover and suddenly you are two metres from the corner to perform the cinematic takedown. The uncertainity of whether the AI will spot you, sometines you walk right in front without them noticing yet other times you are across the room with them facing in the other direction and they swing around shooting at you. There are optional micro transactions but they are certainly not required to play at all (I built my character exactly as I wanted to no problem) so I don't see them as an issue. Now to list the redeeming qualities: it feels like a Deus Ex game. What I mean is the story, setting and protaganist all certainly feel like they are part of that universe. It's dialogue and the story itself are well written, the characters are engaging. *Slight spoiler alert* I wanted to know what happens next when the game finished to see where the story went next as well as as the next location was being heavily hinted at being Australia, a place I haven't explored in video game form (even though it would be a futuristic one of course).

First of all you can buy Any weapon or item you want and at any time. They added a hop over obsticle action when you hid behind things (however it doesnt always work and they removed the ability to jump.) However a lot of things are screwed up compared to the last game. The game models look so mechanical. Many of the characters you meet have a dead glassy stare and their bodys sometimes have badly textured looks compared to the first game. The hacking challenge is messed up. I hacked a level 5 panel without setting off anything. I hacked a level three and set it off every time. The AI is terrible and the fact bodies evaporate 5 seconds after they are knocked out or dead robs you of a little challenge in the game. The enviroments are either really nice or really bad and they use most of the old music from the last game so it feels less original. they have also got a Game chapter that Walking dead and Wolf among us has going. Ultimately this is a fun game to play for the story, not as a deus ex game. Buy it on sale but if your paying full price your going to regret it.",

Good for being stealthy, bad for knowing if you killed somebody or knocked them out. - No stealth-based achievement. You can still get Smooth Operator after missions, but there's no equivalent of The Foxiest of the Hounds - No boss battles - No mention of the Illuminati - Significantly fewer takedown animations  Cons: - The map is too small. Instead of the outside of Panama City being one giant map, it was divided into four or five smaller maps, so travelling places meant you were looking at at least two loading screens between the time you left and the time you got there. - It's a port of a mobile game. The graphics and interfaces reflect this. You get used to it, but it was still lazy. - You can't sell items, and now I have 20 mines and a hundred beers that I can't use. - My pistol is apparently stronger than my assault rifle. - The cover mechanic is wonky. The game couldn't decide if you just need to click the right mouse button or actually hold it to get into cover, and when you moved the mouse to look behind you, you would move out of cover.  When it comes to bugs and glitches, I'm either incredibly lucky or they were all fixed, because I played through twice and I never encountered any.  In summary, 3/5, not deserving of all the hate it gets, but doesn't live up to Human Revolution. If it wasn't a Deus Ex game, I think more people would have liked it.",

More than half the dialog in this game is broken. Infact I would guesstimate that 80% of the spoken dialog in this release is not working. In my professional opinion (I am an A+ tech IRL) there is absolutely NO excuse for a game to be released unfinished... especially an episodic release. There were a few other minor issues that I noted... Frame rates were a little on the low side (not too bad but not butter smooth either) and there was 1 instance that I fell through the world. The last one is forgiveable (♥♥♥♥ happens) but the first one (audio issues) is not.  So here is my take... IF the publisher/developer releases a patch to fix the audio issues then I will update my review and contenue to purchese the series. IF the publisher/developer chooses to abandon this title and move on to the next episode then I will abandon the publisher/developer and not buy their product. I have already done this to UBISOFT.

They have removed jumping or being able to toggle your aim and along with the previously mentioned complaints it gives the feeling of being dumbed down for console, though I have to ask, what console? I'd expect this level from later PS2 games and not current gen systems. Perhaps the only thing I liked, and perhaps thats just a matter of personal taste, is the change in the inventory system, even if being able to just 'buy' more ammo in the middle of a fight isn't at all necissary and breaks whatever suspension of disbelief one might of accumulated.

The protagonist is perhaps the most likeable of the Deus Ex protagonists yet, and the story has all the hallmarks of the series. Conspiracy! Hacking! Helicopters! In addition it plays perfectly on my tablet in 1080p - I wish there were more game developers out there who realized a lot of us who grew up on and love proper FPS gameplay do not want to drop thousands on hot and heavy gaming rigs any more. On the downside, the purchasing of weapons and ammo anywhere really kills the difficulty, and the lack of a jump button does make it feel a bit Wolfenstein 3D. Still, an admirable addition to the canon, and definitely worth a quick playthrough for anyone into sci-fi adventure games. I hope they make a sequel.",

The universe is full of detailed history, unique subject matter, and great RPG options, but with The Fall you only get the tiniest peak into what is an otherwise magnificent franchise. Keeping in mind that it is a port, the controls are clunky and force you to almost ignore what was a great cover/stealth system released in the complete Human Revolution title, and I can't understnd why it wouldn't have been worthwhile to simply redo The Fall with all the polish and joy of the other engine. If I was the King of Square Enix, I would be expecting ritual seppuku from whoever's bright idea it was to release such an embarrassment to the public. I can't believe they allowed it to be released. If you are new to the Deus Ex franchise DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME FIRST, and please don't judge those of us who would normally sing the praise of Edios' jewel.",

The game ended with TO BE CONTINUED. I was speechless and what eventually came from my mouth cannot be repeated here. If you get it for a pound, it might be worth it. I am a huge fan of Deus Ex and have played all of them and praised them as among the best games ever made, but sadly I must call this one poor and give it 2/10. Very disapointed.",
