As someone who is a classy g[ent][le]man who studies classy headwear, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls trilbies fedoras. If you want to be 'specific' like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing. If you're saying 'hat family' you're referring to the categorical grouping of brimmed hats, which includes things from bowlers to homburgs to tophats. So your reasoning for calling a trilby a fedora is because random people 'call the big ones fedoras?' Let's get westerns and pork-pies in there, then, too. Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how fashion works. They're both. A trilby is a trilby and a member of the brimmed hat family. But that's not what you said. You said a trilby is a fedora, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the brimmed hat family fedoras, which means you'd call bowlers, homburgs, and other hats fedoras, too. Which you said you don't. It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?",

            "review_text": "When I was younger I remember having the demo-version of this game, which featured the Little-Tokyo and the following underground level and playing it over and over again. Maybe that's the reason I like this game so much.  Anyways - Chaser is a true old school first person shooter. Long levels in which you might even get lost in your first playthrough but even though it's a shooter you will have lots of different experiences in this game.  Some examples - you flee from a space station, fight your way through mafia goons, defend a truck from incoming enemies and even have a long underwater level in which you have to fend off sentry u-boats while navigating through boat wrecks.  There's also a very big range of your weapon arsenal that changes throughout the game.  And, even though its from 2004, the graphics are still pretty good (if you turn your resolution up enough). Aside from shooting itself you have a Adrenaline-slow motion function that you can use against your enemies. Another important aspect of the game is the story about the Protagonist John Chaser and his amnesia, which is carried on by cutscenes and dialogues throughout the game.  I give this game 9/10 because it was one of the first real shooters I owned and I'm never getting tired of the plain but awesome shooting mechanics in this game.",

Be prepared to quicksave/quickload a lot however, as well as wander the levels sometimes if you get lost. B-",

I was surprised that there's actually a significant amount of story here too. It's not a legendary story, but it's presented well and definitely interesting. Beautiful weapons and environments. The rigid, generic, even sometimes bare nature of the environments actually appeals to me. It feels so uniform, so strongly-structured.  Then they added a slo-mo feature with an adrenaline meter. A very welcome addition. The occasional stealth and some interesting twists make this game definitely worth a playthrough.",

Voice acting could be better though. I've played it on normal, gives a good challenge (at least for a casual gamer like me). Yes, it is quite generic and story doesn't blow your mind, but I'd still rank this very high among the games published around the same year.  EDIT: Okay the Lighthouse Sniper mission is horrible and the mission after that is way too disorienting, gave me a headache in 5 minutes. But still otherwise a good game.",

            "review_text": "What a truly terrible game, good grief. I started writing down things I found wrong with the game after stage one and I filled over half a page in no time flat. I'm tempted to just list them rather than write a proper review.  First things first, what few 'plot' points there are are ripped directly from Total Recall. In this game you take control of  Douglas Quaid  John Chaser as he proceeds to get his ??? to Mars. The first part immediately after you land is kind of neat and has decent cutscenes, but once you actually start to head towards Mars everything just turns into a mess and nothing makes sense at all. Prior to landing all the cutscenes are heavy flashing lights and shaking camera, and after they're just boring until the end.  But people don't play FPS for the plot right? So the devs clearly focused on the gameplay! Right? Right?! Hahahahahahahahahahahahahah. Bullet damage and health spacing is reminiscent of the original Far Cry game (that is to say very high and very poor) without any stealth mechanics or decent graphics. Further the AI is dumb as bricks and appears to be only able to open doors as part of scripted events. If a door shuts in front of them expecting them to be staring you in the face later. 99% of your damage taken will be from some enemy you never saw aimbotting you from above/below/behind/spawning out of thin air. There is absolutely no enemy variety, just guys with guns. And oftentimes it's only one gun per stage. One particularly badly designed stage only has one model for said enemy too (the rest of the stage is a tiny little area copy pasted about 8 or 9 times). The hit effect seems to be bugged or just not implemented right as well so oftentimes you don't even know if you're hit from things, especially falling or explosions.  Did I mention doors? There are a LOT of doors. A lot. And the ones you can use and the ones you don't look EXACTLY the same. But you have to guess which one is right. I cannot emphasize enough how tedious this gets. There is a general lack of direction in the game that will have you wandering around aimlessly; everything looks the same in most of the normal levels. And some of the dead ends REALLY are dead ends; you can't get back. And the levels that attempt to mix it up... well... One of them is generic sniping mission where the graphics are mysteriously downgraded to N64 tier. You get to protect a truck with non-moving wheels as it glides along a port. There's a 'stealth' mission where you instantly die if you fail. But the worst offender is an underwater one with 6 degrees of freedom and seriously screwed up controls. I swear I spent 10-15 minutes where to go on one part of it.  Unsurprisingly there are tons of bugs too. I:  Got stuck on geometry   Saw enemies spawning on top of each other   Crashed several times   Fell through the level attempting to do a required jump to progress   Absolutely disgusting/10  This game is not worth it even for a dollar.

Either it wants me to play it stealthy, but then it throws encounters at me that I have no chance of completing. Or it wants me to be rambo, but the only gun they give me is burst fire and has the recoil of a sniper rifle throwing my aim halfway to the ceiling every time I pull the trigger. Or it wants me to just run through the encounter, but I don't have enough health to make it through anywhere especially since they gave my enemies stronger arms than me so they can actually aim their guns. If you want a retro shooter, pick up something like doom or duke nukem 3d where they bothered with the guns, if you want a running game go pick up mirror's edge, if you want a better stealth game try thief or deus ex.

AI movement in the game is  flaweless.  When playing, I feel I really am fighting a militia that does nothing but walk into walls and move their bodies around at a pace that makes them seem like they're constantly having a seizuree. Truly  immersive.   Also, this game has everything. It's missions range from swimming into a wrecked ship and having no idea where to go unless you get those ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ BALLS THAT SHOW YOU THE WAY to guarding a truck that knows how to drive slow and take the long was in a crucial escape mission. This shows how Chaser reaches to a wide variety of people and the variety  totally doesn't take away from the game at all.  The story in Chaser is also flawless. It feels like the Gods came down to the Earth and handed Jo Wood a golden enchanted pen to write the greatest story ever. And that he did. From the minute you start the game, you have no idea who you are or what the hell is going on. Only the Gods would have the capability of creating a story like this.  Now, onto multiplayer. The servers for this game are  VERY crowded  because of it's popularity. It's almost impossible to find one because of this. But, I was able to play on a server, everything was  perfect.  The hitboxes were  fantastic  and I had  no problems what so ever.   Jo Wood is truly a genius. This game is revolutionary and has made a huge impact on the gaming world.

I learn you can use adrenaline by YouTube near end of the game. - Dubbing. Mother of f★★king god. Castlevania: Symphony of the Night had horrible dubbing. Chaser cross that border. it's horrible² or even horrible³. - Sick hit system (ex. Enemies dies by hit their legs with pistol, but they can simply survive 3 sniper riffle headshots... Or they survive 2 rockets but we die by single hit that exploded 10 meters away). - Music. One song per stage, looped, slighty different from previous stage. BORING. - Lots of illogical things (ex. you open cells to let prisoners escape... You simply make prison break. In return - all prisoners attack you. Just like that). - Horrible labyrinth. Do not approach without video guide. I tried find the way by myself. I lost around 3h of playtime because of that. - Escort/Protect missions. Holy Madoka, just f★★k this s★★t. Characters run and stop whenever they want and just get killed. - Later parts of the game (on Mars especially) is a 'Love Story of Keys F6 and F9'.
