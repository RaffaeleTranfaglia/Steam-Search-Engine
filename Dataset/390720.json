            "review_text": "'At the level of individuals, violence is a cleansing force. It frees the native from his inferiority complex and from his despair and inaction; it makes him fearless and restores his self-respect. Even if the armed struggle has been symbolic and the nation is demobilized through a rapid movement of decolonization, the people have the time to see that the liberation has been the business of each and all and that the leader has no special merit. From thence comes that type of aggressive reticence with regard to the machinery of protocol which young governments quickly show. When the people have taken violent part in the national liberation they will allow no one to set themselves up as 'liberators.' They show themselves to be jealous of the results of their action and take good care not to place their future, their destiny, or the fate of their country in the hands of a living god. Yesterday they were completely irresponsible; today they mean to understand everything and make all decisions. Illuminated by violence, the consciousness of the people rebels against any pacification. From now on the demagogues, the opportunists, and the magicians have a difficult task. The action which has thrown them into a hand-to-hand struggle confers upon the masses a voracious taste for the concrete. The attempt at mystification becomes, in the long run, practically impossible.'  - a tiny cat throwing cop cars around like baseballs",

            "review_text": "This is a really well made game. It's got a slick design and interface and playing it feels really natural and fun. The music is tops and I absolutely love the humor.   The game plays like this: you build up a team of rioters and try to take over the city. You start small and must find more rioters to make your team stronger and get special abilities. There are hidden things to find in the level and you're ranked at the end.   I would totally recommend this to anyone who liked Katamari Damacy and other quirky-type games. The only downside to this game is that it doesn't support a local two player mode. This needs a two player mode!  ",

            "review_text": "Anarcute is an adorable game with levels that become incresingly challenging if you want to get a good score or unlock new rioters. The music is pretty good, the level design is wonderful, I enjoy the humorous nature of the story and the game. I would like to see more levels released in the future, as well as more missions per level. Having said that, I think that a longer game would also warrant new abilities, new upgrades, new enemies, and new traps to encounter.   One thing I definitely think that needs to be addressed are some tighter controls for keyboard users. A controller definitely allows for more smooth camera rotation, and the keyboard rotation can be a bit janky at times, especially when you need that quick rotation to see where the enemies and traps are. For those of us who can only use keyboard (Like me) it makes the game harder, but not in a good way.",
