            "review_text": "As someone who played through and enjoyed the mobile iOS game all the way through the first two difficulty levels and mostly through the last, I'm disappointed by this port. It feels incomplete in some sense, and almost lazy.   For those not in the know, in the mobile version, kit/unit expansion was done through requisition purchases and in-app purchases (hereforth to be referred to as IAP), to buy cards packs. These packs allow for you to get 3 cards, one marine and 2 items (with the chance for rare/epic cards). This system made sense with IAP being a potential option for people who don't have the time to endlessly grind levels and get a chance at getting better marines or gear.   I agree with the exclusion of in-app purchases, let me say that right here. But without them, the way forward is unfortunately set to be a grindfest, with a pack at the end of every chapter. Let's be honest, systems like these - with randomized rewards in a boosterpack like purchase are designed to encourage people to spend real-world money over and over on cards/items they don't need for the chance of getting something they want. That's how it works with trading card games, that's how it works in mobile apps. This system does not make sense in a premium game with no IAP, and as such should have been replaced with something else more fitting.   Maybe non-randomised cards. Gain more requisition per level like gold, buy a marine for X requisition, buy gear for X requisition. Spend requisition on your existing gear to upgrade gear. Meanwhile get exp on missions, level up and advance your marine. And when your marine is capped, spend requisition to advance him to the next tier. That's an example off the top of my head, and most likely would have been tweakable for a much better system than the one currently in place. As it stands you get a small amount of req per level, can purchase tiny 3 card packs, and maybe trade in unused marines and items for small amounts of req, making obtaining better marines and gear a grindfest. Not of the pleasurable kind.   Furthermore, the 3 Enhanced Edition chapters are not complete, and do not progress past tier 2, while the other 3 go to tier 4. Also, the graphics aren't even visibly that much better and there is still no multiplayer.  TLDR: feels lazy, exp/buying marine system broken, incomplete bonus chapter rosters, still no multiplayer. If you really liked the mobile one and want to grind your way through the game on PC go for it i guess...",

            "review_text": "I am writing this review with the caveat that if they remedy the major issues with this game, I will rewrite it.  Right now, I have to suggest that you DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. Too many people are having one of several gamebreaking bugs, which may have something to do with a memory leak in the coding. It is crashing in multiple different ways for dozens of people, check the forum. These issues should have been removed in Beta testing.  It has been a week since I emailed Rodeo Games on this issue (Giving them my dxdiag), and while they were polite I have received no help or communication since then. They did not suggest any fixes or what the problem might be. They are aware of the bug and are not responding to it properly. I am no 'Rocket Surgeon' but I am capable with computers and know my way around a file system, so it is really disappointing to have no presence on this as I am confident any information would help.  Some people have found changing security settings to work, but this is only for one iteration of the bug. Others say it is an issue with the Unreal engine, and that may be plausible.The main bug most people experience stalls you at the Logo bar and initiates a linear increase memory leak until it crashes or your computer freezes. This is called the 'black box' bug because that is what you will end up staring at until you restart your computer.   I have seen people running it on youtube, but that is the developer release and I am not sure it has the same coding. I want to like this game. I want to play it, even despite the issues with overly simplistic gameplay mechanics. I can't recommend it though.   Not when:  A) there are so many people who can't play the game, even with fitting specs B) It is a higher price than the version it is ported from C) It hasn't been optimized from that port. D) It is buggy even besides this. E) The in game economy is broken because they were too lazy to rewrite the Pay to play market code.  If you ABSOLUTELY have to own EVERY 40k game, and you experience no gamebreaking bugs, this is still not a $30 game. Wait for a HEAVY discount on a steam sale and wait for them to patch the code.   Look at all the reviews and the one word you will see the most is LAZY. Everything about this game from what I can see is half-asked and lazily done. They didn't polish this game and I wonder if they even stress tested the game between releasing it as a FTP and as a PC port.  Unacceptable behavior that is becoming too common in the games industry. This is disrespectful to the customer base.  TL;DR: BROKEN GAME FOR MANY, BEWARE AND RESERVE TIME FOR YOUR REFUND IF YOU ATTEMPT TO RUN IT.",

            "review_text": "This game is pretty fun, and while the 'pay to win' grind ported over, the game play and increased difficulty/increased drop quality make it not so bad. It's not nearly as good a tactics game as XCom, for example, but the traits and the different weapons make it playable. Definitely worth $10-$15 if you get it on sale.  That said, it gets a thumb down because of the bugs. You can find several threads in the forum of people complaining for the last year, and emailing the devs, with no response about achievements that don't trigger, and other bugs.  I love WH40k, but I've played cell phone games with more polish than this, and if the devs won't fix the broken achievements, they don't deserve a positive review.",

All in all, should one enjoy the w40k climate, or just turn-based tactics in general, and find this title at reduced price - it's definitely worth buying.",

I normaly play it when waiting for freinds to come online or between doing other things. It is a game to fill your time with (is is a copy of a mobile game so it is to be expected)   Weapons and marines are based of cards, you get one card everytime you complete a mission and you can buy them with in game points (note they are NO micro transactions) you get a pack of 3 cards for ever 100 points and you get 20 points per completed mission you can also sell old weapons and troops for 4 points each to boost what you have for the card packs.  I you want a game to fill out time with fun yet simple game play I owuld recomend this game, it looks beautiful and the troop interactions with each other make the levels intresting.   Like i said its a fluff or fill out game, i would not pay more than Â£5 for it but i do enjoy it",

Unfortunately, there was some kind of framerate issue which caused all the lighting effects to constantly flicker, to the point of inducing a headache. I exited the game with the intention of checking the forums for a potential solution.  Checked the forums, didn't find anything about my issue, decided to try to fiddle with visual settings to try and fix it myself. Unfortunately, the game refused to start up again, immediately crashing to desktop. Tried again and again, no good, checked the forums, turns out to be a common issue (works once, then crashes every time). Apparently the devs haven't been heard from since October, and doubts run rampant about it ever being fixed.  Heading to refund it. Do not recommend getting this, at least not in it's current state.",

It has a faster pace, more enemy variety, more weapon varieties, and a cool little leveling system. I think that some of the abilitys should cost less experience points to buy, but it does make an interesting choice of 'do I level up now, or do I save up my exp points to buy an ability?' Still, it hasn't broken the game for me yet.  the game does have some bugs in it currently, but I think they will be patched out later on. Again this is a very fun game when it comes to some good 40k action. In my own oppinion it's a good buy and a very fun game to play.",
