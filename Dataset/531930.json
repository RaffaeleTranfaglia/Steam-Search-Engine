            "review_text": "Dungeon Rats is a pretty niche game and as such, kinda hard to describe to the crowd.  Let say that everything started with a RPG: Age of Decadence. The big selling point of Age of Decadence was its multi (multi-multi) paths, dialogue options and etc. Not remember exaclty how many endings the game had for itself, but on top of my memory I would say about 6.  AoD also had for itself a pretty interesting tactical-kit. With Dungeon Rats, I just realised oh ♥♥♥♥ing great it was. Which leads me to explain what Dungeon rats is: Dungeon rats is a 10 hours (or so) game that involves: tactical combats and pretty much only that. There is difficulty, difficulty mod and decisions replayability. Play in solo or in party, ironmod off/on, 3 difficulty settings and a few (very vew actually) decisions to make. It's taking all the aside of an RPG to the bare minimum and letting the sword and spears do the talking.  To review quickly what AoD combat is about: Each weapon had its own moves, reach, AP cost, damage potential. Not as a nonsensical individual weapon, like you find in most game where this sword is doing 30, and later in the game this sword lvl 7 is doing 60 and later 60 + frost poo 1.2 and xy% + namely ♥♥♥♥.  Here: A sword is a sword.  And any sword is a sword. Let say a sword cost 3 ap to act and deal between 5-7 damage.  Every other sword will do that. Exactly that. While a spear will act a bit differently and offer different moves it will also have a better reach. Now on top of that there are different kind of weapons for every category. A mineb is an axe, a skegged is an axe. The same way a scimetar is a sword and a glavius is another sword. So you get ton♥♥♥♥♥ of choice for your weapons of choices and no need for nonsensical stuff. 2 handed weapons will also offer better reach (wether they are spears, swords, axes...) than 1 handed weapons. And not every weapon is made of the same material: they can be made of bronze, iron, steel etc. Which change their stats. They can also have specific quality inerhited from their forgers, indeed wether you loot them or forge them, you can get weapons with specific bonuses and again, nothing ridiculous and idiotic. And thus, you end up with tons of different weapons offering tons of different playing-style.   I've read other reviewers stating that the game get repetitive (from a combat perspective), and I would say that it is true for any game. For any game you have this feel of repetitivness after a while, would it be for Total War serie, for Planescape: Torment, for Battlefield 3. Even game that has tonshit of huge tons of stats and stuff: Age of Wonders (1+2+3) or even Dominions: 4: they get repetitive. But here, I can see something that might make DR feel more repetitive that it could be.  While its standard tactical-kit is impeccable (downright ♥♥♥♥ing gorgeous), the devs wanted to stay ''non nonsensical'', no mage fireball, no dwarf pickaxe thrower, no terminator machine gun. But as I see it, it also becomes a bit of an issue, when you make a ''rough'' game. You need that little bit of folly there and there, you need that little something that makes you ''WOW'', more so with a game that cries authenticity and handcrafted material, because it makes it even more plausible and kewl.  I am playing Tyranny atm. Yes, I know. I digress. But ♥♥♥♥ I can't play that game. The stats, the items, everything is nonsensical. Everything is ton♥♥♥♥♥ of stats garbage complete poo. There is no sword, there is no spear, there is no hammer, there is no skill that I want to master. There ''sword and shield'', or ''dual ♥♥♥♥''. Nothing that makes sense. Just video game things put in a video game to make an ''RPG'' solo player with, ofc, MMO layers because. No reason.  What I mean to say for the readers that I lost: AoD, Dungeon Rats: they are handcrafted, they are real, everything is cared about, everything has a reason to be, and the game is ''rough''.    Another con: Dungeon Rats was just a grab.  Now, I understand the devs reasons, i still had a blast, i still support them 300%. But Dungeon Rats could have been, way, better than what it is atm if it was more rpg-ish. Even with 2-3 months (as stated by devs themselves) of work would have made a few decisions there and there much, much more satisfying over all.   Well, not sure if my review is crap. But the game sure is cool. 90% combat oriented, pretty much TBS, be ready to resort to violence and have your butt-kicked in the dirt. It's a big + if you played AoD previously imo. I would also like to mention the music, atmosphere, ambients, they all work like a charm.",

            "review_text": "Dungeon Rats is a combat-only sequel to Age of Decadence, like Fallout Tactics was to Fallout 2. This stripped down version of the game has only combat, alchemy, and crafting. Fortunately, those were arguably the best parts of AoD. The tactical turn-based combat is complex, engaging, and well designed. Every encounter is challenging and makes you use all of your resources. Each one is like a puzzle; they seem intractable at first, then you try some new tactic and you get halfway through the fight, and keep tweaking until you find the perfect solution. Every build is unique, and the game plays quite differently in solo-mode versus party-mode.",

Although it is not as long or indepth as AoC, DR still has a very good story line that made me want to keep playing even after I beat it. When you start your journey you are at rock bottom and you will have to claw your way out.   It takes tatical thinking to get you to the next level, It pushs you to think two steps ahead of your opponents. This game made me use a lot of items that I overlooked in AoC.   The graphics are not mind blowing, but the combat and atmosphere of the game make it great deal of fun.  ",

I am hoping that the next game will have more meat to it. I'd rather wait several years for a meaty game like AoD, than a few months for something like this. Either way, thanks for the game.  Especially if they do squad based combat ever again. I'd love to see it in a game with more story.",

            "review_text": "This game would have been a great dungeon crawler if not for one thing: the game is WAY and I mean WAAAAAAAAAAY too random. If you play on anything but normal forget about dodge, because whatever level it is enemies WILL hit you at least 3-4 times and without a shield that's enough to kill anyone who doesn't have 60 hp. And also forget about aimed attacks. They are COMPLETELY useless unless you are lucky enough to land a 40% chance to hit knockdown first or have a billion black powder bombs\\nets. And even then 70-97 percent chances are basically 40-50 so consider that as well. I really wanted to like this game, but this is just ridiculous. The devs need to adjust the randomness, because currently any dodge based build is required to savescum 3-4 times EVERY fight.   But, but, but... if you like the random nature of the game and like dungeon crawlers then this game is perfect, so I can still recommend it.",

Has potential, if there was sound, if the camera would stop skipping around at the slightest twitch of the mouse, and if you could, say, use belt items in combat or reload a ranged weapon intuitively. Sadly, I cannot say the novelty outweighed the frustration of not being able to do what I expected to be able to do. Why can some characters attack at an angle, but not others (possibly a weapon advantage)? Why could I not use a healing potion I had in my belt in combat? Why did my net entagle ME in combat, not my foe (there was no reference to a critical fumble in the combat ticker)? I don't know - because the tutorial didn't go into depth, and there is no manual or help option in the game that I could find. Sorry, but I do not recommend.",
