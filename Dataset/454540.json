            "review_text": "This is a pay to win game and if you want to get anywhere you WILL have to shell out real world money to get there. You can play the game for free but you cannot earn enough money to build yourself up to a formidable status. I’m not going to knock it for being a P2W because it’s designed to cater to its paying members and this is the business model the Developers have decided to go with, but be advised, you cannot earn enough money playing under the free umbrella to establish yourself as a legitimate competitor. The entire map is run by a few clans of people who had the opportunity to do a land grab when it first came out and establish settlements around all the cities. Everyone who comes in now has to set up their bases in the wastelands because there’s only a certain amount of spots available and the good ones have been taken. The Devs have already stated that there will not be any resets so the areas that have already been settled will never be available for new combers. If you do earn enough money to establish a settlement in the Wasteland you will be exposed to Pirate attacks and without the protection of the city or kicking in a lot of money on defenses, can quickly be overrun. This is a very slow paced economics game and if you are looking for action you will find very little here. Everything runs at a snail’s pace and has very few upgrades for speed. This is the kind of game you will run in the background while you’re doing something more important. You earn money by buying, transporting and selling cargo and in the beginning they make it quite easy for you to do so. After you working your way up to level 2 things start getting a little more difficult as the easy beginner cargo runs become less frequent and by the third level it is no longer profitable. It is at this point where the free-to-play game will become stagnant and it will become abundantly clear that you are going nowhere unless you pay real-world money. In level 2 you can earn approximately 96 gold every 15-20 minutes. This is dependent on how fast you can load your cargo, how many others are competing for the same run and how fast you can turn your ships around. This is about the quickest you can earn money as a free player and because everything costs money in the game, its gone as fast as you can earn it. The learning curve for this game is very difficult and there's not much in the way of instructions. There is a chat where you can ask questions and sometimes you will get a coherent response. There is a basic map that you can look at but it does not show all the established trading locations. It only shows the larger cities. This map is not zoomable or customizable and in my opinion is of poor design. You are told when you first begin that you have a 30 day grace period where you cannot be killed but it only applies if you stay within a certain distance of a city and as I said before you cannot establish a settlement anywhere near a city because the land is already been claimed.  There are people in the game who will set up a bogus cargo jobs which as a newbie you might unintentionally choose. When you attempt to complete the run you will find it to be an ambush where you will be destroyed on site. Once you've clicked on the job you cannot go back or cancel it and if you choose not to deliver you’ll be charged a penalty fee (they call it a deposit). This dirty gameplay is not only accepted it’s promoted because it’s allowed to take place in the beginner cities where newbies are easily tricked. As a New player you cannot be expected to know the difference between a legitimate job and bogus jobs.  I’ve played this game for about 30 days so I’m not criticizing it without having given it an honest workout. There are a lot of annoying bugs that need to be worked on, details that need to be incorporated and balances that need to be set in place. As the game sits now, I cannot recommend it. ",

            "review_text": "Yeah, so this is basically a steampunk world version of EVE online. Basically that means it's offensively awesome. Within an hour of launching my first time I set a destination due North East of the starting town, simple delivery. I then decided it would be super awesome to hop onto the hangglider and glide next to my airship, which is like +5 level of pure awesome right there. Of course a sensible person would in this scenario of course reduce the ship's speed so that when you want to reboard it you can... so... I totes didn't do that. And so I figured I would just crash into the ground and respawn on the ship. Nope. Spawned back in the starting city. I just launched a ghost ship due North East of Misty-whatever. I couldn't stop laughing for five minutes.",

            "review_text": "Changed my review from positive to negative after weeks of playing. Hopefully, that qualifies me to review it. See below.  Unfortunatley, this game has some major flaws that ruin the experience for me.  1. It is a chore to produce high quantities of goods. Jobs have to be queued up and checked in on frequently. Pretty soon, you will be spending your entire in game time just building.  2. PVP Is an absolute joke. Myself and some friends ran through the east in Wolf 150s completely unchecked. We were leveling bases left and right and never met any resistance. The automated defense system is really bad. Myself and an officer tanked a castle with dozens of missile launchers for over an hour while we simply reduced it to ash. In addition, fighting other players is a VERY time consuming process. It can take over an hour to destroy an enemy ship and they can simply use leap and go home.   3. This game takes a HUGE amount of time. Unless you are unemployed, you simply can't put the time in to build an empire. As an ex eve player, I understand commitment and having large blocks of time but, 12 hours a day is a bit much.  4. In game chat. Ugh, ANY frame lag will mess up in game chat and you will find your cursor suddenly 2 letters back with no way to reposition it.  5. No real promise of feature enhancements. When players complain about lack of a feature or a part of the game that is not fleshed out, the developer answer is to explain to them how it works. The ol 'This isn't a bug. It's a feature!' argument. In addition to that, the only upcoming content I am aware of is more ships and more 'things' that will cost more money to play.   6. It is REALLY pay to win. This game is the hallmark for P2W. The only real way to make money in game aside from REAL money is contracts which don't pay much. When a ship costs 4000-6000 gold to buy...without weapons, that means at least a week of grinding contracts. Those who can afford it simply put real money in since you get massive amounts of gold for very little money. The game is so one sided toward the pay2win players (me included) that those trying to legitimately make money are hopeless.   7. Clan system is terrible. You can't rename your clan. You can't assign officers. All you have is the leader and members. Nothing in between. We had to deal with theft since clan access is turned on by default on all buildings.   8. Streks. WIth 5 or 6 friends, you can level a castle in a single pass using 100lb bombs. That is so broken. We were completely destroying everything our enemy owned on a daily bases. They would rebuild, we would crush, rinse, repeat.   9. No communication to the english community. Like I said earlier, DEVs answer questions here on steam....sorta. Rather than acknowledge issues in the game, they simply explain how it is supposed to be that way. Also, we have some Russian members that pop in from time to time to tell us about all the cool upcoming features the devs are telling them about on the russian forums. If it weren't for those players, we would know nothing about it.  10. Reputation system. As a governor, my rep went from positive 10k to negative 10k in a single night thanks to a band of Russians destroying everything in my territory. That is just plain dumb. In their defense, the developers are supposedly reducing the penalty for governors.   11. Lack of a tutorial. I made tutorial videos and I hope they have helped you all. I am told quite often how I have been more help than the actual developers. That's sad guys. Don't release a game in another language unless you are prepared to communicate at the same level with those players.   There are many more issues to be honest but last night as I spent hours and hours to gather the resources to upgrade a single farm, I just stopped and said, 'I'm done.' As it is, this game is broken and it is losing players like crazy. I should have known better. This game has been out for years in Russia and I shouldn't have expected major changes to suddendly appear when we all started playing.",
