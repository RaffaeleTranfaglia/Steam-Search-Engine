I've loved Mario and platformer games since I was a kid, and this game just fit right in.   I love the replayability of it with all the different available characters, plus the costumes are all so cute. For a group of 2 people to make this game alone, it takes a bunch of effort to learn how to model and animate and code all of this. I personally like seeing projects made with Unreal Engine, and seeing how this was made with UDK is even more impressive.   Congratulations to you two, this game is great!",

            "review_text": "It is a realy good game and has a cute presentation. But I would say it is not a game for children. The levels are huge and need some time to complete, the checkpoints are very rare - so that you often have to play from the very beginning.  The boss-enemies are not so obviouse how th beat them. In other games you get a hint - here you can just guess - and that is very frustrating.",

Excellent graphics, but need a bit works, (I hate to say that, but I'm just pointing out the background) overall its still looks good.  Music is going to be my favour, I'm waiting for Official release...   This game content violence and bloodly effects, its definitely not for little kid. So, make sure to consider it before you buy.

Solid game a lot of fun even for those who aren’t into platformers.

She will become an egg-breeding machine, unless you stop them   and whoever else who's willing to give her the eggs  !  Prove how loyal of a baby to your mom, you truly are! Take on the adventure! Starve the cavemen. Kick them where it hurts the most.  In the nutsy balls ! Or suffer an ultimate guilt for letting your mom work as an omelette-making machine!  Will you save your mom?  Or will you make her regret not kicking you off the cliff with your brown diapers, when she had the first chance?  Will you make her regret not leaving you to the hungry T-Rex that ate her husband when hunting for dinner.. for you? Will you sadden her even more, reminding her of the chance she had to leave you to sea-beasts? That very day when your grandparents sacrificed themselves to fill the hunger of the beasts so they would let you go.  That my friends, is the ultimate choice each one of you will make!",

There are many other better more fun platformers out there.  Also, any game that forces you to sit throught a long intro cutscene with no way to skip is off to a bad start for me.  If its a great game I will probably never know as I will be uninstalling it and leaving it in the dust after my 6 min of first impression. Ain't got time for this.",
