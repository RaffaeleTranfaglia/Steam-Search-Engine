            "review_text": "I think I was one of the people who didn't have a problem running the game... I also played through the tutorial and got my first story quest/mission done. I really liked the heartstone vibe they gave the game. I have some cool information I was able to gather while I played and can share with those waiting for the game to be fixed:  - When you start the game you can get a free starter pack at the store that gives you 20/22 cards of each color to make your own decks and lands to go along with them.  - Right now there are 18 pages of 12 cards each ingame... so around 216 cards to collect and make decks at launch.  - First Boosters are called Origins Boosters and are priced as follows: 1x150g, 2x300g, 8x1200g, 20x3000g. Each booster has 6 cards.  - You can foil cards for 5G and it foils all cards of that type you have.  - You can get Gs ingame... first tutorial quest gives you 30g and first full main story campaign gives 150G (that's the only one I have unlocked sorry)...   - You can get Gs online by playing against other players or against bots: 5g vs easy, 10g vs medium or 15g vs hard. (I couldn't play against other players)  - The game has an option to play with a fully custom made deck or it has a deck wizard that helps you make the kind of deck you want with the cards you have (that I found quite good)  - Pricing for Gs on the store is as follows: 150g x 2us$ (1 booster), 500g x 5us$, 1250g x 10us$, 3750g x 25us$ or 7500g x 40us$.  I never played too much Magic before but I really liked what I saw here... not too flashy animation wise but functional... I hope game gets fixed as soon as possible so all can try it. Right now I can recommend this game, it looked fun and free... gold didn't seem that difficult to get too and there are lots of carts to start.",

Most of the huge bugs have been fixed, 2hg is now playable with steam friends, very few crashes to desktop or game freezes.   The pool of cards is getting huge and deckbuilding is more fun than ever. Even if some archetypes* are more dominant and seem to be everywhere in the top ranks, there is a lot of options and you will have to make hard choices to fine tune and cut down excess cards to make your perfect 60 cards decks.  Starting out with no collection might be hard and you will have to grind for golds a long time before you get the base for strong decks if you dont want to pay at all. I did pay as much as i would pay for a good game and im not disapointed as i have played this game for more than 800 hours and i still have fun with it.  *not refering to archetype autodeckbuilder; use manual deckbuilder and make your own.",

That means less reliance on powerful cards and more need for deck synergy.  + You can compete against other players from all over the world using your unique decks  + The game is updated with new expansions and manages to bring something new to the table in regular intervals.  + Thanks in part to daily quests, a regular and dedicated player (who already owns the backlog of cards) can manage to generate enough in game currency to obtain every single new card without too much hassle. I would also like to mention that you don't need all the existing cards to build competitive decks.  - Story mode additions are too short and threadbare.  - Every expansion brings several new bugs which is understandable for a game with so many possibilities, but the developers are a bit lazy when it comes to adressing these issues and patches are overdue.",

Personally I didn't like it thought it was a bad game but this on the other hand is a completely different story it's fun, simple and free. I love card games and since there's not much good ones out there this hits the need to play a new one.  There's plenty of things to like about this game the artwork is amazing, the soundtrack is beautiful and the card art and designs are something to adore, plus the simple animations add onto it all. The game has a good tutorial very easy to understand, the user interface is easy to use and just about everything is visually helpful and appealing to your eyes. The settings are decent as much as you'd expect from a trading card game. Controls are easy and fluid, the mouse works great and so does a controller. Building your card deck is fun and in depth, there's heaps of deck builds to choose from. Designing your deck I thought was a nice touch as well, you get to choose the card deck's art, avatar and avatar background. The real gem here though is the coop/tag and the online battles they are super fun and enjoyable, it's pretty much what you will be playing unless your really into the lore which the story does a great job of providing.  Now the bad, honestly I thought in this day and age a simple card game like this would come with borderless windowed mode/fullscreen window but it doesn't. Personally I thought the tutorial was way too long and well I kinda got bored of it half way through but you still need to finish it your forced too. The battlefield or table doesn't look as good as it did in previous games but I'll forgive it because it's visually intuitive. Drawing cards still feels somewhat rigged but it's not as bad as it use to be and getting gold is grindy but still I'd take that over DLC any day of the week.  This is what they should have done years ago, it's exactly what I wanted Magic the Gathering games to be like and playing for free is perfect... no more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t downloadable content.",

The selection in boosters as reached the point that it's a investment to collect the variety of random cards to build decks.  Can you compete with the basics? Yes. It'll be hard and you'll need to play well. The biggest problem, still, is random crashes and connectivity. With an online game, this is unacceptable and continues to be the largest flaw in this interation of MTG.  Stay free to play, work the grind. Buying into boosters doesn't address the bug aspects and you get a decent game free.",

However there is still a long way to go for this game and i encourage the developers not to give up.   what ive noticed: 1) the algorithms for drawing cards is off, this is clearly apparent as some games you will draw many lands, while other games you will not draw any or not draw enough lands to get what you need done.  2) played against the bots earlier on two headed giants and the AI had more creatures than me or my ally, had they turned and attacked with them all we would have lost, instead they decided to tap them for their tap abilities and only attack with one flying creature, thus gave me and my ally a chance to win....while this was fun, it didn't feel like i was vs. another intellegence, as they vastly outnumbered us and our health was below 13, they should have turned and attacked.  3) I noticed quite a few bugs when teaming up with an ally in two headed giant, a fix for this would be nice as the multiplayer aspect is a game maker.  thanks.

Now I am far from being a pro or native to the scene but I do enjoy to play MTG every so often. For me, this game is a great alternative to buying expensive card packs. Sure, I have to grind myself through duels to get new cards, but that's kinda what I'm here for.  The game does suffer from some netcode errors though but that is about the only downside I have found for myself so far. It is sometimes frustrating to have to try 3-4 times to find a match but apparently (don't wuote me on this) the devs are working on it. And sure, I'd like to get new cards faster, but I also understand trying to make money with your work. Thus I support the F2P model this game uses as for me it gives me enough of a chance to earn all of the cards without investing real life money. And I don't think we can ask for more.",

This has also cost me some critical moves, as it is often unclear on how to do certain more advaned moves.  I have also found one or two mistakes in the rules - which I cannot believe Wizards made/allowed! I like the card collection that you can build up and that you don't need to spend real money to be able to play the game. The deck creator has MUCH room for improvement and I found it rather difficult to use.

I just don't think that this game deserves better than this repelling 'mixed' screaming at you not to download it.  Now I am far from being a pro or native to the scene but I do enjoy to play MTG every so often. For me, this game is a great alternative to buying expensive card packs. Sure, I have to grind myself through duels to get new cards, but that's kinda what I'm here for.  The game does suffer from some netcode errors though but that is about the only downside I have found for myself so far. It is sometimes frustrating to have to try 3-4 times to find a match but apparently (don't wuote me on this) the devs are working on it. And sure, I'd like to get new cards faster, but I also understand trying to make money with your work. Thus I support the F2P model this game uses as for me it gives me enough of a chance to earn all of the cards without investing real life money. And I don't think we can ask for more.",

I'm not one to play online against others because of peoples poor sportsmanship and leaving games, or better yet doing something to freeze your game so that you don't get the win. Because of this, I prefer to play single duels against AI, which then leads me to hope that the choice of ai players in two headed games would be an option instead of waiting on other players to join. I also can't stand playing the game out on the actual magic server for the same reasons mentioned above. For saying that, thanks to Steam and all the people behind the scenes that makes Magic Duels available to people like me. I would recommend this version of the game more so than any other to anyone wanting to learn how to play the game, or even someone like myself that still plays the original version from microprose.",

On a scale of 0.0 to 10.0, this is about a 7.5. If they could fix the bugs and make matchmaking not so sucky, we'd go to about 8.9. If you could eliminate (or up) the number of decks you can store from 30 to at least 50. that would bump us up to around 9.4.  Read other reviews and draw your own conclusions. If you feel strongly about other elements (like microtransactions) then stay away. On microtransaction -- if you play the game a lot, you get a goodly number of 'free' coins to offset, in my opinion.  The mechanics and the ability to play a decent AI are important to me (I can't always play with a human because I get interrupted). Those work pretty well.

I'll start off with a TLDR and then explain in detail afterwards.  Overall thoughts: Get this game if you like Magic, you won't regret it.  Pros: It's Magic for free.  Interface is well done and easy to pick up.  Multiplayer matchmaking is quick and games are fluid and fun.   Boosters award cards intelligently, and will not give you more cards than the legal allowed amount.  Cons:  The game still suffers random crashes.  No Draft modes/limited multiplayer modes.  In detail now.  Pros:  It's Magic for free. Unlike previous DotP games, the sets that are relased in this game are closely tied to the actual sets that are released in paper. You don't have to pay money for it and everything in game can be earned through the in-game currency. This by itself should merit a download if you enjoy the card game.  Interface is well done and easy to pick up. The game is chok full of step-by-step interactive tutorials as well as exclusive story mode campaigns for every expansion release. Unlike magic online, every action in game is very clearly explained to you and the very basics of the game is narrated to you as well. Anyone new to the game can learn everything there is to know without trouble.  Multiplayer matchmaking is quick and games are fluid and fun. Enough said.  Boosters award cards intelligently, and will not give you more cards than the legal allowed amount. So once you pick up four copies of a card, you won't get any more copies of that card. and once you complete the full set, that set will not longer be available for purchase. Thus, every booster will always increase your collection in a useful manner.  Cons:  The game still suffers random crashes, and if this happens, you will lose your progress, which is particularly relevant for daily quests. If you were close to finishing a daily, all of the progress made in that game will be gone. Thankfully, this hasn't happened that much for me, but it has happened. I think developers are actively working to minimize such occurances.  No Draft modes/limited multiplayer modes. This is a very minor nitpick to be honest. There are 3rd party apps you can use to simulate drafts and with a small group of players you can emulate this off game and construct the drafted deck in-game to play. This applies to most other 1v1 alternative game modes. This however requires you to own the full collection of cards so you can actually construct the deck you drafted. That said, this is actually easier to do than most games due to the way boosters handle duplicates.   ",

Some time if your friends dont crush you out right' it's simply because your friends are not cold blooded computer and dont unleash their full power at you. Where im going with this, is that AI are NEVER gonna be perfect and it is good that way, they are not too tought where you never gonna win a fight and they are not too easy so that you are no just wacking some brainless virtual opponents.  6- The only sad thing about all this is that in 2HG you dont get any money even when you play against real opponents i see why in 1v1 when you invite someone to play you dont get any, that is to prevent farming without playing but 2HG i dont really get it ... hell even only 5G would be fun it would reward those who invite their friends to play the game with them, to give those guys a small candy  And last point, no chat is a good thing in this game because trolls are so toxic and in this kind of game it make your play time really bad to play against those, and we all know that out there we have WAY more trolls that good guys, I would had one in 2HG with your ally but it is not game breaker  I hope my review will help you see past all those bad review because some ppl can't enjoy anything in life even for FREE Thank you, and have a good day",

            "review_text": "As a fan of Magic: The Gathering, having the ability to play whenever, wherever I like is convienent- not to mention, having the freedom to connect with friends is also nice. Magic Duels provides an exciting magic experience and is free-to-play- win-win. There are pros and cons to this game, however. Below are some of the key features of this game that I like and dislike:  --PROS:   A very easy to navigate set of GUIs that are very artistically created and implemented. The effect is that the gamer feels immersed in the world of Magic upon entering the game. The GUI, honestly looks very professional, and needs no improvement as far as I can see.   A helpful, search-powered deck-builder and card collecting system makes the efforts of strategizing and amassing cards a pleasant experience. On that note, it would be stellar if the gamer were able to search his stash of cards for key words too.   A very fun single-player, story mode that shares some of the lore of the MTG universe with fans. In my opinion, this is one of the very unique features of the game that should be explored more by the developers. The backgrounds of many of the characters/planeswalkers, the invasion of the scittering Eldrazi and the like are actually quite compelling. I recommend better backgrounds (instead of foggy purple), music and more campaign missions with each release; a map that shows the movement of the given character would be classy too.   The game's versus mode is fun and easy-to-use.   A unique take on the game. A card's rarity in this game determines how many of them one may use in this deck. While some may find this a Con, I personally find this rule balances the game more between the beginners and free-to-players versus the experienced and play-to-winners. A powerful deck is still a powerful deck, but they don't seem to be so powerful that a beginner has no chance at winning. This is why I believe this is a Pro for Duels.   The game continues to progress! With each real world set release, Duels also has a similar release. This effectively keeps the game fresh.  --CONS:   Although the background music isn't terrible- in fact, sometimes it feels quite epic- I would encourage the developers to seek more variety in the theme and motifs, else it ends up feeling like Duels is caught in a slow elevator that won't stop.   There is no economy to this game- no way to trade. Unfortunately, I believe many Magic fans may be deterred by this feature. The inability to trade and sell cards is something that many enjoy with the tangible version of the game.   There is a game mode called 'Two-Headed Giant,' which although fun is very squished graphically and tends to be a chore to play through. A sectioned background or perhaps a environment where the gamers can pan around the tabletop and zoom in/out would make the experience more enjoyable.   There aren't multiple competetive modes. This is something that will likely change down the road as more sets are released. I imagine the developers will have a mode equivalent to 'Modern' in the the tangible version of the game. I do hope the developers plan to release the older sets! (I want my Pack Rats and Necrotic Oozes! ;))  --   Overall, I give this game four out of five stars, and only half a star is given because I plainly enjoy magic. I would and do recommend this game to friends.",

Versus battle system seems a bit unstable - sometimes you find games instatly sometimes you wait 3-4 minutes due to disconnects.  2. Strange system, which makes you continue a Versus battle even if the opponent left and the game was take over by the AI. At this point losing will also make you go down i rankings. I find this stupid that I can still lose after my opponent conceded. 3. I keep hearing and reading about the crashes. I personally didn't experience any (except maybe once), but it seems that it is an issue for a non-zero amount of players. 4. Card choice seems rather limited at the moment, but still some cool decks can be made. 5. Strange quest system. First of all you can only get gold from quests with decks that you built with the in-game deck wizard, which really narrows down your options (although is the best way for the rookies to get working decks). 6. You always get 40 gold per quest be it 'win 4 games' or 'win 2 games', for me it's strange that I get the same reward, where I commited 2 times more of my time. 7. To this point I only once encountered a quest that let me use a deck of my own design. This was also the only quest that rewarded 60 gold not 40.  So... As you can see list of the flaws is pretty lenghty. But I still recommend this game. Why? Because it doesn't cost you anything. Earning the boosters comes pretty easy (without hard-core playing you will still probably get 1 free boster for 1,5 day) and I see this game as a project for the future. It's still relatively new, I hope they will fix the server issues and versus battle mode. With time new cards will be added and deck variety will grow and so on and so forth. And if I'm hoping in vain? I can always uninstall, it didn't cost me a penny, except for my time.",

With a decent story mode, average AI components, random matchmaking duels, and decking building options; magick duels proves to be a decent strategy game. However, the draws back may include (although are not limited to) unbalanced matchmaking (players get pitted against players who are way above their own rank), decking build issues (new players cannot truelly build a solid deck via deck wizard because it only shows some of the usable cards for each step), and the cost of booster packs (150 gold for one booster pack is a bit much, considering that is equivelant to 10 wins against an AI on hard mode, especially for players who are new to magick). That being said, Magick Duels is an above average strategy card game, considering it is free to play.

Magic duels is a perfect game for beginners learning to play Magic the gathering. The UI is simple yet effective, the cards in the game are interesting yet simple, and pretty much a very pleasant game to enjoy. (You can also be creative with your deckbuilding, like me and my friends made pseudo-highlander decks in Duels and it was hella fun!)  The game also updates it's content frequently, (better or for worse) and is totally FREE!  However, I would not recommend this for older MTG players, because of the lack of cards in the game, and the lack of depth in the game that many veterans of the game may find lacking. In the previous DotP-games, there were decks that had really powerful cards, like future sight, primordial hydra and Kozilek, the butcher of truth.   Furthermore, the game lacks any sort of variety in terms of other gameplay modes, there's the single player campaign, single player mode and multiplayer mode, but that's basically it. The only mode that really chances fundementally the rules of the match is two-headed giant, but even that is flawed. The other games in the series however had really unique modes like archenemy and planechase, that I really enjoyed.  So, to recap, this is not for the MTG veteran trying to find a free version of MTGO, but is rather a fun game to enjoy for new players, or for people who just enjoy playing a slightly kitchen table-y version of Magic.  Would Recommend.",

(Total disappointment when you dont get what you want. And YESSSSSSS when you get what you want.  Cons -Takes a long time to collect cards (unless you buy)- They upped the coin rewards so its faster now. -They dont release every card from sets. -Can only have 3 of an uncommon, 2 rare, and 1 mythic cards owned - Match making system isnt perfect.

Some options to make a stop at a specific time or a bigger window, when a lot is going on would help - matchmaking seems pretty random - matchmaking 2v2 takes very very long most of the time  - If u are in matchmaking and 'joining', u can't cancel or stop and you have to kill the game because it doesn't progress for minutes The last thing, but it isn't so much the PC Game problem.

Magic duels is a perfect game for beginners learning to play Magic the gathering. The UI is simple yet effective, the cards in the game are interesting yet simple, and pretty much a very pleasant game to enjoy. (You can also be creative with your deckbuilding, like me and my friends made pseudo-highlander decks in Duels and it was hella fun!)  The game also updates it's content frequently, (better or for worse) and is totally FREE!

You play games to get gold to buy boosters and build decks. this is how:  - Finish the campaigns (with premade decks) to get gold and to buy boosters with - Play against AI or other players tog get more gold - Finish daily and weekly quests to get EVEN MORE GOLD!  Finishing the campaign earns you around 15 boosters (gold and free boosters included) and you get the rest by playing the other modes and finishing quests. The major difference here being, that the boosters contain 6 instead of 15 cards, like the real ones do.  The game itself isn't perfect. It has a few glitches and issues. The tutorial is mandatory. On the plus side - the cards and sets get updated regularly and there is always a new campaign for the new sets.  The game deserves a chance. from Newcommers and experienced MTG players.   ",

For Magic Duels, that means limited deck crafting capabilities, meaning you can only have 3 copies of each uncommon card, 2 copies of each rare, and only 1 copy of each mythic in your deck. This can be a large annoyance, but can be worked with. Another problem may be the booster packs offered. Each pack of only six cards (instead of 15) costs 150 gold pieces. As someone who also plays Hearthstone, I have absolutely no problem with playing an average of 10 games for each pack. 3rd and final problem- If your computer sucks, the game sucks. This is something I haven't learned through my own experience but through and by others. The games tends to crash often if you're using a low quality computer. My game has never crashed, so I can only assume this is the reason. As a side note, I encourage all to realize that this is not a pay to win game. Instead of trying to start out fighting other people, battle the AI until you have a decent deck. It does wonders. Great game 7.9/10",

I see so many thumbs down about people crying they cant grind all day with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ deck or w/e. Man up you wimps! Use the tools provided to kick everyones ♥♥♥! After playing through the story missions of all 5 planeswalkers you get like 1100ish gold to spend and three free packs on top of that. So if u want to do well, play their story missions earn that gold! Some are harder than others especially some of jaces story and lillianna's. The others were quite decent difficulty. So you earn your 10 packs or w/e and your sitting on quite a bit of possible deck options. Now its your job to make decks based off those standard cards and 10 boosters. Not bad actually! ATM i hold a 75% win rate with my deck. Which is mostly made of standard edition free gimmie cards they hand you for free. Yes thats 75% vs other players. If you have deck building mind when it comes to mtg and you are NOT one of those FNM poser d-bags that followed net decks all the time thinking you were good at mtg. Then you shouldnt have any problem WHAT SO EVER establishing a solid deck out of what you get. I love mtg. sometimes i hate and rage so hard at the bugs on this game so bad i wanna break ♥♥♥♥ in RL. Thats when i just step away burn a doob and relax for 10mins.For instance there's a bug when you try to two headed with a freind that boots one of you before the opponents can be found. Not cool! So after about 30 atempts you get into a 2 headed vs other players. Another bug is once in a blue moon when you win a game it dc's you from the game but not the internet and your sitting there hitting recconnect and its just failing and it doesn't give you your gold. OMFG! that one pisses me off so bad. Other than that game runs works just fine. remember as i said before they have addmitted they are working on a steam fix currently. It's the next thing to be implimented and these issues we have will be issues of the past. I dont reccomend making any purchase's till they get this steam connectivity bs ironed out tho. Hell by the time you read this review the bugs i mentioned probably wont even exist anymore. You are your only road block to your own success.   p.s I will no longer base my opinion of a game off steam reviews alone. All i seen on here was people giving the game thumbs downs. I dont feel a majority of these people were even MTG players at heart to begin with. If they were they were most lilkly just another crappy net decker. Stupid net deckers. pshh",

Cards are unlocked by buying boosters with Coins won through Single/Multiplayer duels, campaign missions and daily tasks. The booster packs are not cheap but for me this only adds to the exitement and anticipation of opening a new pack of cards. Just like in real life, cracking open a booster to find that card you've been waiting for to perfect and tune your deck is an exhilarating and rewarding experience.  I have only recently begun playing Magic in the past month or 2 and because of this game i have increased in skill and understanding of the game rapidly and exponentially. It familiarizes players with the rules, key words and tactics used in constructed MTG play. The deck building wizard isnt my favorite because it turns the art of fine tuning a deck into a mash up of vaguely connected cards. Although i'm not fond of the deck wizard method of deck construction all is made right through the ability to maually constuct decks from scratch. Being able to build decks without the hassle of sweeping through a thousand cards to find the ones i'm looking for is one of my favorite parts of having a digitally organized collection.  Finally if the developers follow through with the release of digital content that coincides with paper releases (such as the Battle for Zendikar cards that were released on October 2nd) I think this game would be one of my favorites of all time. I've currently logged over 40 hours into the game and have no intention of taking a hiatus.  In conclusion I would say that this game may not be for everyone but if you love MTG and you want to step up your skill in deck building as well as tactful play then this is a great game. It's been getting some negative feedback but i thought it important to throw the other end of the spectrum into the limelight as someone who really enjoys the game. ",

That doesn't change here, but unfortunately some of the digital aspects of the game need a lot of work:  Unlocking all of the cards without spending money is one hell of a grind. Worse than any of the DoTP games. (however, their business model is much better than DoTP 2015, which isn't saying much).  The decks you can build with the starter pack of cards are all terrible. Better cards are unlocked, but it takes time or money.  Servers are frequently down. Progress cannot be made towards unlocking cards while servers are down. This may change in the future.  Deck builder is missing some key functionality such as sorting cards by keyword.  The card pool is based on the current set of paper magic cards, Magic Origins, a set which, compared both to other paper Magic card sets and the DoTP games is terribly lackluster. This may change when the new set comes out in a few months and the card pool is updated.   However, the game still gets a positive review from me since you can easily get many enjoyable hours of gameplay out of it without spending a cent.",

            "review_text": "I have mixed feelings about the game.  For those who love MTG and want a free way to play online with paying for the interface that takes some getting used to with Magic Online, then this is probably for you. I say probably because you will have to play through the whole tutorial (took me about 45 minutes to skip through) and every time you play and are introduced to a new game concept such as lifelink, you will be prompted (though not required) to play a 'skills test' that teaches you how to use the ability strategically.  For those new to the game and enjoyed Hearthstone, but want to play Magic: The Gathering, this is a great start. Keep in mind that Magic will be slower paced than Hearthstone simply because it is a more complex and, in my opinion, rich game offering greater variety of custimization and play-style.  For those who have played before and want a way to play online, you will have to deal with the tutorial and some minor annoyances like that for your first couple hours.  A few notes about complaints with this game:  1. The Deck Wizard - the deck wizard will limit your selection of cards to fit a number of distinct recommended themes for each deck you build to have a cohesive strategy. This doesn't always work for a competitive deck to play online because it ignores converted mana cost, for example. But it is a great way to learn how to deck build.  2. Quests - you can only complete quests that ask you to win games with certain archetypes (like a blue/black deck) using decks built with the deck wizard. I personally find this annoying and HOPE IT CAN BE CHANGED TO INCLUDE CUSTOM DECKS FOR QUESTS, but I can appreciate that Wizards is using this game for new players more than catering to old players.  3. Playing Online - I experienced an inability to play online until about a week ago (beginning of October). Since then I can play online no problem - zero server errors or connection problems. I believe the problem has been fixed, though this may just be my experience.  4. Graphic Errors - I have never experienced any problems with graphics. I'm running everything maxed and it looks very nice. Cut-scenes are horrible though, but oh well. I'm just happy to see cards come to life :)  5. Coin Cap - I personally have never met a coin gap and I play online all the time, sometimes making two boosters a day without paying any outside currency. I still have never paid to play this game.  Without paying any money I have been able to build a fun and somewhat competitive Elf based deck with Nissa and Shaman of the Pack with Jagged-Scar Archers and Lys Alana Huntmaster. It's a lot of fun.  I hope this has been helpful. I personally think a lot of this game's criticism comes from people who just don't understand how to play the game. I meet people who play online all the time that just don't know what they're doing and I can imagine that might lead to upset feelings.",

Admittedly this game is shifted mainly towards new players, and almost invasively so. But gameplay is solid and competitive, only a couple 'stupid computer' instances. The story mode splits into the 5 colors, all good but the black deck story tree was TERRIBLE, its like they didnt know what they were doing when they created that deck, After i beat the 'story' mode i had owned about half the cards available in the game (not counting multiples). Id also like to note that after story i had enough cards to make a very decent deck, i saw a lot of ♥♥♥♥♥ing about how ppl couldnt make anything good out of their cards, i can say those ppl lack creativity. You need coins to buy more card packs to expand your library, at first i was gaining coins like crazy, then after story mode was done my income was slowed down to a shambling ghoul, you earn 15 coins from battling the hardest ai which is roughly 7% of a new pack. There are daily 'quests' which can net you some extra but it is really slow to earn more packs after story mode, probably on purpose as seeing this is free to play and they want your money. Il probably lose interest before buying any cards, seeing as how multiplayer is so flawed that my purchases dont seem worth it to just battle AI all day. Multiplayer just flat out doesnt work, and it never has really for any magic game. BUT you can create a local lan game or an invite friend game(i didnt test it though to see its stability) With friends or a better multiplayer that actually works i might have played this game much more. Its got its kinks but if you like magic then youll like this game. Im giving this a thumbs up but it deserves a sideways thumb due to the stupid intro levels, f2p scheme is too long, and multiplayer doesnt work.

And yes, if you are an experienced player and can't enjoy the game without getting all the rare cards right away, acquiring new cards will seem tedious and/or expensive. But, if you are like me and even a deck consisting mostly of commons, with a pinch of imagination, can be something exciting for you to play, then just keep an eye on your quests and you'll have a steady stream of booster packs, just enough to spice up your decks, and, eventually, even more than you would be able to squeeze in. And you can build as many decks as you want. And all of that for free.  Some people are saying that AI is OP, others - that it is way too stupid. For me that's a sign, that it is actually really good, and to be honest I was quite impressed both by the cunning, effective moves it pulls out, and non-obvious mistakes it makes. I wish more games had such an entertaining AI.  It seems that the bulk of the negative reviews comes from MTG veterans, who expect this game to give them everything they ever wanted or imagined for free, and that overwhelming negativity drives off the beginners and casual players, who are the actual target audience here.

Gold is pretty easily made compared to other games. Though not given away because they still want to make some money at some point and content is easily unlockable.   Once you get the maximum number of cards you can get (4 common, 3 uncommuns, 2 rares, 1 mythic) You're never getting it again. So there's a maximum number of packs you can buy and you don't have to deal with useless copies.   Gold is earned as followed. You can play VS. AI to get 5,10,15g for Easy,Medium,Hard AI respectively and you get 20g for a VS Player win. There's some Daily quest which can give anywhere from 20 - 60g. there's a 400g gold cap (Quest doesn't count toward gold cap) (at the time of the review there's a random bug and the gold cap won't reset someday but it's usually back the day after.  For the moment, there's only 3 modes you can play. Vs player, Vs AI, And 2 headed giant (2 vs 2) The AI is 'Decent' sometime it's dumb but the fact that it gets all the cards makes it win from time to time.  There's only 1 set of cards for the moment but it's been confirmed every paper set they releases will be added in part (70-80%) in the game for players to buy with in game currency and real money. So the pool of card, even if limited for the moment, will probably get way bigger eventually.  And the question everyone is asking of course... IS IT PAY TO WIN??? The answer isn't simple. Magic by definition as always been a Pay to Win game. The more cards you get the more option you have the better deck you can make. In this game... It's controlled by the fact you can't make a 'all mythic and rare deck' Since you can easily unlock all the content (Of course it's gonna take longer for free players) You can always compete at the highest level. I personally get my gold from AI and i'll jump to PVP when i'm happy with my main deck.   So Overall. Card arts are amazing. Gameplay is pretty good. AI is a decent adversary (though you will win way more than you lose if you're a veteran) 2HG Is pretty fun in CO-OP there's no in game chat though so get a friend from your steam list or skype or just deal with the persons decision.",

All I get in a black background and half of the character portrets cut out. 2. They only have one set of cards. Yeah theres 257 (or more) of them but in real life we have Gazilions of cards. 3. Out of those cards we have only 6 planeswalkers (maybe less) 4. No Nicos Bolas 5. No player interactivity. (Though this could be because my background is black but who knows.)  Though the game has become more stable then what it was with me in the begining. And it is magic at it's most basic form so it is nice. For newbies there are countless 'Skill Quests' for the player to learn and practice in fake battles with a robot. These 'Quests' aren't really needed for me or a vet of Magic and it's annoying that there isn't a pop-up saying 'Are you familier in magic?' And one of those saying 'Damn right, I don't play no ♥♥♥♥ing Yugi-Oh.' And then another saying 'Hell yeah' and makign sure to never have those ♥♥♥♥ing 'Skill Quests' pop up.  Magic Duels gets a very basic: Whatever the hell you want/10 For its ♥♥♥♥ launch and being an Okay game...  And Why don't they have Nicos Bolas?    It's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t...",

They brought back Two-Headed Giant which 2015 definitely seemed lacking without, they brought in difficulties of AI when you do your own matches, and while you start off with pretty bad cards, you can easily get more, and really start stacking up against your opponent. Story Mode doesn't let you use your own deck like in the past, but for good reason, telling the Origins of the 5 big Planeswalkers, wich Gideon starting you off, sort of like a tutorial.

Now, neglect these reviews as irrelevant, because the game itself is beautiful, well-polished, fascinating MtG experience. = Stainless really got the hang of it through previous iterations (see 'Duels of the Planeswalkers' series) and delivered finished product. Interface is slickier than ever, every inch of your screen is used wisely. Fonts are sharp, lines are thin and curvy, cards are beautiful (as always). Gameplay-wise there's new tutorial-like experience right inside your usual match, when you see some new mechanics and have a choice to launch voice-narrated practical tutorial for it. After short tutorial and one-turn challenge, you return to your match seamlessly. Also, two-headed giant mode is welcome addition to usual choice of battle types. Deck-builder is one of the most memorable features of MDO. Not only you can choose either to have an assistance in your new killer-deck construction or pick every single card yourself (with greatly-customizable filters to use). You can also design your deck's look (character, background and name)! Pricing. Some folk here have used pricing as a negative aspect (the game is f2p after all). I say: 'What pricing?'. There's no need in purchasing anything so far. You get 2 regular quests (e.g. 'win 4 duels with green-white deck - get 40 gold') and 1 community wide (for now it's 'complete Liliana Vess campaign 35000 times', which is close to completion btw). You get gold for every single duel/battle so buying booster packs without spending RM is not a problem. = PS. Yes, there are still server side outages from time to time but it's getting better every hour in my experience. If you are a Magician, wanting a fix (a long and pleasant one, at that) or just a fan of trading card games, who never played anything more complex than HS, look no more. Go and play Duels now.",

This is good, considering that if you look at pure numbers, Hearthstone is a terrible TCG. As far as digital TCGs go, this is a fantastic attempt. There are a few things that it's missing, mainly an ability to work towards specific cards. Hearthstone's mechanic of 'disenchanting' cards to craft new ones is fantastic, and allows for you to weed out the abolute trash you will more than likely get out of a booster and turn it into something useful. In my limited MTG experience, I've found I prefer certain colors, and the ability to turn multiple cards of one color into a specific card of another color, for example, would be welcome. I haven't run into a situation where I have more than four of one specific card, mainly because I haven't been able to play for that long due to issues connecting to the servers, but I feel like buying boosters and ending up with more than four of a card could end up being a serious problem and make booster purchases less exciting than they could be.  As far as the gameplay goes, It's MTG. same as it's been for every other yearly release. Nothing to really discuss there. The gameplay tutorial may annoy folks who already know how the game works, but it's a tiny time investment (maybe two hours) that you won't have to repeat. It's particularly nice for new players, as it literally spells out how the game functions without you needing to read long tutorials or look up mechanics constantly. The biggest difference is the ability to earn gold while playing, which you can then spend on boosters. The issue is that there is a cap to the amount of gold you can earn per-day, essentially stunting your progress. Understandably, however, they want to keep people who have less time to sink into the game on a level playing field with people who have nothing better to do. This is fair.  Moving on to card selection, I really don't have anything to say, since I've only been playing MTG (casually) for the last three or so years, so I don't know about potential gamebreakers.

If you want game to be popular and dont die you nid players who are interested in Magic Duels outh of game. Promoting streamers or youtube chanels would be good for you, or some sites abouth your game. If your game go in stage where people play few games in day and dont talk with other players it will sure die. Sry for bad grammar ;D",

I originally played Magic Duels of the Planeswalkers 2013 and I kind of miss the cards from that game but some from that game do pop up in story mode and I'm sure they will probably be added into this game at a later date. They do have a good bit of new cards, or atleast cards I have not seen before. It is possible to get all the cards without paying a dime so this is a true free to play game. You have the freedom in this iteration of the MTG games to craft a deck that you want, no strict rules except a 100(?) card limit per deck and a maximum of 30(?) decks is allowed. Unfortunately, this game has some flaws. Fortunately they are not so much gameplay flaws as they are technical issues. I would imagine that technical issues are easier to fix rather than gameplay flaws that require a complete overhaul of a feature or something. In particular, searching for a Two Headed Giant match can be stressful due to the game joining a match only to be sent back to the main menu with a message popping up saying something along the lines of the match being filled up or no longer available. I have also experienced some input lag or high ping, where I clicked on a card to play but it did not actually play or activate for a couple of seconds. I knew I could activate it because there were no other actions being taken by the other players. I don't know if the regular 1v1 matchmaking has these issues because if I play online, I am usually playing Two Headed Giant. Other than these issues, the game itself is pretty great. I'd give the game a 8/10.",

Duels is a great FTP re-introduction to the game as an online experience. Where MTGO is an endless rabbit hole, Duels is a fun diversion. Highly recommended in its own right and as a break from your other Steam games. To note for beginners: once you become rated on a season you will be matched with opponents closer to your skill level. Check out some starter deck builds online (try the Steam forums) to mill gold against the AI, then build your decks with boosters. You don't have to pay to win, but you can take the shortcut of buying gold as well. Watch LegenVD on the 'tube to learn some sound strategy, and you'll be much more competitive in no time.  *Edit: After trying out the full-fledged MTGO experience, I can only emphasize that you should stick with Duels for fun casual play. Unless you're a tournament player willing to drop a couple hundred $ on MTGO so that you can keep up with the current meta between real-life meets, you'll have a very poor gaming experience in all regards--from the horrible interface to the curb-stomping 'community' to the constant pressure to BUY BUY BUY, Magic Online is decidedly unappealing.

What now needs to be fixed is the filter for deck building.  Original review: Usually would recommend this game as it was really fun and I like Magic. And I think this is a good implementation. But since about 3 weeks (and strangely since I bought coins for real money for the first time) I just keep on losing about every match (dropped to rank 1 meanwhile).  Reasons - Start with 2 Mana and nearly never draw more (common for many people) - Start with 5 Mana and draw nearly only Mana for the next turns (common for many people) - Opponent seems to draw perfect card combinations that nearly always work out while I draw the wrong cards in the wrong situation  The last one may be a subjective reason, but even if I go for Meta decks, that does not work out. Maybe all other rank 2-5 are pros with perfect decks, I cannot say, but if you want to play a few rounds of magic and lose 90% of the time due to mainly “unfair” reasons this discourages playing. If only the devs would get that Mana-flood-shortage-problem fixed, it would be a start.  So if you just want to play a few relaxing rounds of Magic, this game is not for you.   I now played for 180 hours and for about 150 of them, everything was fine (Don’t get me wrong, I think I always lost more games than I have won. It was just not such a hard difference than it is now). Maybe anyone can comment: Did the player base get significantly better the last month or what could be the reason that?",

With a little more patches I feel that game can be a 10/10. right now its about a 7/10. I hear they will be adding an expansion with more cards which really excites me. The deck builder in the game is really built well, and I would probably play MTG online if it were more like this game. Its not a pay to win though you can pay for coins to unlock decks.

Early decks are not very competitive &amp; limited in possibility as fewer than 200 cards are available to you. On top of that there's a daily limit where you stop earning gold. You also only earn it in 1v1 not in 2v2.  - Certain cards &amp; combos are overpowered (Gain health on creature death + deathtouch + instant regeneration = impossible to beat)  - Deck variation is limited in MP;  - SP is too short and too much of it is tutorial/must get lucky draw.  - Achievements are very lengthy compared to other Magic games  All that said, I'd still recommend it if you enjoy CCGs  I would have liked to have seen:  - Sycing with other platforms (seriously - who would pay for this twice!?)  - 3v1  - Challenges  - Better deck filtering options (unable to filter by things like Flying or Deathtouch)",

The normal flow of a game is to attack with all (maybe deselect a few). But the 'Skip attack' button is located in the flow of button presses. It appears after the timer expires, exactly where you expect the 'attack with all' button. You click the button immediately when it appears because that's when the timer expires. This is really annoying because it's a non-reparable action. When you skip the attack, that's it, you cannot do anything anymore to attack. I'd like the buttons to be swapped. Because if you acidentally attack with all, you can just press again to cancel. Or have a separate button to skip the attack. But hiding the skip attack behind a timer has already negatively affected several of my games, where I ended up losing because I accidentally skipped an attack. Especially because you often have to click the 'Continue' button located in exactly the same place. So you hover your mouse on that position, ready to click when the timer expires. Another way to do it is not show a continue button that you can't click anyway, but show the skip attack button right away and only put it into effect after the timer expires. Then you're reminded upfront about the fact that there won't be an attack all button there. And when you do need the skip attack button, you can already get that action in and continue focus on your cards. ",

The first time I downloaded it, the game would not run right and kept crashing. If you know someone who wants to begin playing Magic the Gathering, download this game for them. The first 30mins of gameplay is pretty much going over Magic.  My recommendations? Players like me who have played Magic for 10+ years... stay away from this game. Stick to Magic Online or paper. If you are a beginer, by all means, play this game. Long distance players who cannot aford Magic Online but wants to play with friends, this is a good start.  I am hoping that Wizard updates this game and keeps it up to date with the sets; but so far I have yet to see anything coming up.",

            "review_text": "People keep comparing this game to Hearthstone and to the cardboard version. This comparison is rather unfair. Hearthstone was designed from scratch to be a computer game, Magic the Gathering was not. The latter has a lot of complexities that make it very difficult to translate into a computer game (for example Hearthstone has no instants, and basically nothing that you can do during your opponent's turn, which makes it a lot simpler as a computer game), while keeping it simple and easy to play, and fun. (Magic the Gathering Online is the most complete attempt at a computerized version of the game, and it's extremely complex, very beginner-unfriendly, and very hard to play even for an experienced (cardboard) Magic player because of its almost unyieldingly complex user interface and the limitations of screen space.)  People seem to forget that the Duels of the Planeswalkers series is an attempt at making MtG a lot more easier and enjoyable to play as a computer game, and a lot more approachable for beginners (and even seasoned cardboard Magic players.) It does so beautifully, and rather faithfully to the actual card game: Rather than change the rules of the game, the DotP version is made simpler by a more limited set of cards and a somewhat simplified turn structure (where you can nevertheless still do most of the thing you can do in the cardboard version.) Quite many Magic players were in fact introduced to the game thanks to the DotP series (including, in fact, myself.)  Is this game absolutely perfect? No. Does it have its defects and limitations (both from a technical and a gameplay perspective, and even accepting that some compromises need to be made in order to avoid making the game too complex to play)? Yes. Do those defects matter all that much in the end? Not really. The game is still as enjoyable to play as ever (although, of course, if we are comparing it to the previous DotP games, it's a matter of opinion which one of them has been the best.)  And, unlike previous games in the series, it's free. Why would anybody not recommend this? It's not like you are losing anything by trying it.  Sure, it still has some technical hickups and some gameplay limitations (that wouldn't need to be there), but it's still a very well-made, enjoyable game. There is zero reason not to recommend it.",

I often felt that its going to be stressful when another person is in the mix because that person may have a different goals in playing this game than I do.   There are some A.I. issues of course. It is predictable. So its like, tetris or BeJeweled but with Magic Cards. However, sometimes the A.I. will pull out some insane combo on me that makes me think if a person is playing. These moments are agonizing but gets you pumped.   My hope is that they keep adding more cards and even give us the ability to export cards from older duels of the planeswalker games because that will just increase the fun factor of this game by a huge margin.   Unfortunately, I am very patient and I never find myself buying packs and yet I have completed the two sets that are currently available. I have bought the older Duelse of The Planeswalker games because there is no option to get it for free so that worries me. I guess if they offer more cards that are not available for multiplayer but only for single play that are not able to get for free that would work for someone like me and generate revenue streams for them.  If you are like me who likes to just play magic cards for the fun of it then you will not be dissapointed with this game.",

            "review_text": "The game is far from being perfect by any means. There's plently of bugs scattered about, 2 headed giant connectivty probelsm or so I'm told, some issues with hackers/griefers online, and a few odd crashes. However if you look past all that and give it a chance you'll find a pretty solid free to play Magic the Gathering game.  It does a very good job of explaining the basics of the game that any new player to Magic should have no trouble figruing out what they're doing. It contains a nice amount of tutorials that range from basic how to play to giving a quick look as to how the new mechanics work. And the best part of these tutorials? You actually get in game currency for playing through them, giving even more encouragement for newer players to go through them.  At time of writing the game just recieved an update that brought two new sets to the game bringing the total number of card sets to 4 and a starter box. It should be noted the 4 sets are not full complete sets but rather 75% or so of the set they are based off of. Supposed they had to keep you playing MTGO or paper somehow. But despite the sets not being the complete sets and limit of how many of each card you can have by rarity,there are still dozens of potenetial decks that can be built and in the very least perform decently aganist the AI.  In regards to obatining cards and where the free to play aspect comes in is that cards must be gotten via packs from the in game store. Each pack cost 150 coins the in game currency. Now this is where I feel the f2p aspect was done very well. Of course you can just buy coins for money and unlock every card in the game instantly if you so chose, but if you don't take that path or are unable well don't worry. This game is easily the most generous I've seen a f2p game be with in game currency. Every week see a community goal for roughly 60 coins, and everyday you receive a fairly easy to complete quest that rewards 60-100 coins. You can hold up to three quest at a time and you're allowed to reroll a quest once day making it fairly easy to have 300 coins worth of quests at a given time. AI matches reward 5-15 coin dependant on difficulty, online play gives 20 coins a win and a 30 coin bonus for first win of the day. There is also story mode and the forementioned tutorials that reward coins for first time completion. A dedicated player can easy get 3-4 packs a day if they grind out the daily coin cap and do the daily quest, and even more casual players are likely to find it easy to get at least 1 pack a day.  The only other thing of note is the story mdoe mentioned above. Magic's story has been fairly stechy and not on the forefront and used to be primarly told from novels found in fat packs once upon a time ago. The story mode here isn't much to write home about. The story is mostly told in a paragraph or so before and after any battle in story mode and everynow and again a very questionable cutscene. The story is mostly just a summary to begin with those inertested int he story however will find much more at the actual Magic the Gathering website. The story it's self is rather simple and gives you a preconstructed deck that changes as you progress much like the old duels of the planeswalkers games. The main appeal to the story each chapter rewards enough coin to buy 1 pack from the shop, with the very first story rewards 7 packs worth of coins for those just starting the game.  So in closing it stands as a pretty fair f2p game that doesn't make you feel forced to dump money to do anything. The game certainly has flaws without doubt but still stands as a solid and much cheaper alternative to MTGO or paper, not to mention the interface is far more appealing than MTGO's. So don't let the negativity around the game scare you away, it's not as bad as many people claim it to be. Besides it's a free download that's around a gig and a half so worst case scenrio you don't like it and uninstall it.",

I've played some Hearthstone before trying Magic and enjoyed it, but this game has so many more layers of depth and strategy than Hearthstone.

The story mode does a great job of explaining each function of the game as you encounter it during normal play.  The number of cards in this version of the game is very limited when compared to the paper version or Magic Online, but there are many cards in this game and lots of ways to play with what this game has to offer. Also, all cards can be earned through playing and without paying.   My biggest complaint is that I can't play on steam, then play from my phone or ipad using the same account. Although the game is available for iOS, the accounts cannot be linked. Because of this, I do not play on iOS. I do not want to start a new account for iOS, and build decks twice.

Create your own deck or you can use the deck wizard if dont know exactly how to make a hard hitter or dont have the right kind of cards you're looking for for the deck you want. You earn coins through completing the campains and various other battle types, as well as just completing the skill quests to learn how to play. Because of the forementioned coin system, there is no need to spend any actual currency on the game if you choose not to. All in all, Magic Duels is the best Magic the Gathering online card game thus far. I'm very curious to see what new ways they expand the already massive card library, myself owning quite a large collection of physical cards. My only gripe about the game is that the Xbox one server can be glitchy not giving you coins that you've clearly earned, or evern the worst of all, my entire collection just disapeared one day. As well as purchased boosters in the store and were never given them. But thats Xbox, and thats why I started playing on the PC. I'll have to contact wizards about that, I've just been too lazy, or busy, well both. Great game though. 10/10",

There are some huge downfalls, however, and the biggest is that while Magic Duels is free-to-play, there is a 400 gold cap on PVP matchwins per day and if you're hardcore, this is gonna irk you quite a bit. Also, the interface can get more or less buggy as updates and fixes are released (currently its on the 'more' side), there's no booster draft or sealed deck modes, and even if there were, boosters in Magic Duels are maybe a third of their IRL counterparts and you can only have one per mythic.

            "review_text": "Improved from early on, Duels offers a good introduction to Magic and it's rules while offering a free to play experience and an ever expanding card pool. While currently there are only two sets available (Origins and Battle for Zendikar) it's an inexpensive, especially compared to paper magic, way for players of games like hearthstone to sample and enjoy a much more complex and rewarding experience.  The downside however, is the somewhat clunky interface - Magic was not designed specifically for a PC or mobile experience, so compared to games like Hearthstone its many phases can take much longer than they would in an offline game - and rather poor experience with the AI.  The AI seems to almost always play variations of the same blue/white deck full of tempo cards, and while it is good at extending the length of games, it isn't particularly challenging, especially once a player has worked through enough coins to amass a sizeable collection.  The online experience is better, although again its a mixed bag with things like searching the library/graveyard being much faster and smoother than a table top Magic experience, while things like navigating phases and responding to opponents actions at the correct points in the stack can feel wonky and require much more attention than in an offline environment.  The ranked experience is pretty similar to other online card games, where you are given a rank (in this case a number) and are normally automatically matched up with other players within 5 or so levels of the same rank. There are instances when players with a wider spread are matched, but this is likely due to lower player count at those times rather than something with the matchmaking algorithm.   It is a free to play game after all, and with that comes grinding in game currency, in this case coins. Recently the amount of coins granted for doing in game things was greatly increased, and at the new level the experience is improved. Each pack costs 150 coins and each player is capped at earning 400 coins per day, with a mission (currently of between 50 and 100 coins) available, as well as 30 coins per win in online matchmaking and a bonus of 20 coins for the first win in online matchmaking. This means with 1 online matchmaking game and a couple games against the 'hard' AI (at 15 coins each per win) you can earn something like a pack a day only playing 3-4 games.  At the moment to a player semi dedicated to playing regularly it shouldn't be hard to keep up with grinding playsets without trouble once you have the current cards, but for a new or more casual player, especially as sets are added, it will likely require some packs to be purchased with real money to be competitive or have access to all the strategies in the game.  Overall Duels is a great game in a pretty package, for free. If you have the time, money, and inclination to play paper magic, do it, Duels just doesn't (and isn't likely intended to) compete with that. But for anyone looking for their Magic fix without spending thousands of dollars on paper Magic decks and touranments, or just to explore a more complex and interactive game coming from Hearthstone or other online card games in a free to play environment, this game does that and does it well.",

Not quite the comprehensive Magic simulation that I was hoping for (read: containing more of the older sets) but certainly not a bad game.  Playing with your own constructed decks against the AI is fine, although expect some cheese when the computer 'draws' precisely the card needed to either a) defeat you the turn before you defeat it or b) eliminate the threat you have that will win the game next turn.  The multiplayer battle mode is a bit slow to get started. One thing that should be turned off by default when using multiplayer is the viewing of damage animations as it just slows everything down.  Multiplayer lacks a bunch of features though!  - Can't view your opponent's deck after a battle, unless somehow they get through all 60 cards. - Can't chat with your opponent (unless you're Steam friends with them already, and even then you're using Steam messaging through the overlay). - No way to track your W/L record or view the statistics for each of your decks. - No control whatsoever over who you get randomly matched up with. One duel I was level 7 facing a level 2, the next duel I was level 8 facing a level 22. Could it be that the 22 was trying out a new / less powerful deck? Sure, but they could just as easily have gone 21-0 and I'd have no way of knowing. It would be great if there was a limiter to say 'match me up within +/- 5 levels' or something of the kind.  This game has a ton of promise, and although it has hints of pay-to-win (you can use Steam wallet to purchase in-game coins which then get turned into booster packs), it's not terribly hard to grind out booster packs five multiplayer wins at a time. Some modifications to the multiplayer system wouldn't be out of place, though.",

These tutorials are not mandatory however, which is nice because I personally have been playing magic for over 10 years so was really glad that I wasn't forced to learn the long list of rules that most of I already knew.  THE BAD: the matchmaking is really messed up sometimes. When I first started playing (and sometimes still) when you join a versus match it will put you up against like a rank 20 player which is unfair in my opinion because most of the time those really high rank players have a deck that consists of basically all rare cards meaning 1 of 2 things...A: they spent a ton of money and basically bought there way to a high ranking. B: they have been playing for longer meaning they have garnered a good amount of cards from there time spent. (neither of these are a bad thing, just kind of unfair to newer players or people that haven't spent a ton, or any money on the game.) Anyway just think that's kind of unfair, I'm pretty sure there isn't any rank restrictions (meaning the game is able to put a rank 20 player against a rank 1 player)   And lastly, yes I've encountered a handful of bugs but it is to be expected in a card game as complex as magic is.

(Well, the UI in the constructor)  *The UI looks to be designed for Consoles more than Computers. Wich is annoying.  The Game is simplefied/Streamlined wich turns missclicks into missplays with no chance to change your mind. Such as:  You want to play a card at the start of your turn, you click it but the graphics lag behind since you just drew a card and you instead play a different card. And there is no way to stop the card from being played.   Solution: There should be a prompt asking you to confirm your play. A prompt wich you can disable in the options  Probably my biggest problem is Rarity restrictions, Magic rules say, you may only have 4 copies of any card with the same name.

It is a grind at times since the Zendikar set came out, because despite my reluctance to affirm the complainers of this game, the AI seems to have about a 80% chance of using a U/W deck which is all control. But I take it as an opportunity to construct a deck which can work around it using a W/G deck (♥♥♥♥ing elves..I hate elves), and Ive been doing pretty good so far with an win average of 75%.   I have not read all the negative reviews, but most of them consist of nonsense complaints about how much they suck at the game, and how they cant win since the AI primarily uses the U/W control deck, or how they cant use 4 of the same cards so the game is 'different'.

I like to try to imitate some of the strategies I see in winning standard decks, but with missing cards it gets hard.  I think you should keep some land destroying cards in play (now there is only one). With lots of awaken cards it seems like land destroy is a valid counter strategy.   I also like the fact you limit the availabilty of rare cards. Thus keeping us from spending a lot of money and balancing the decks.

Between the clear and concise tutorials, gameplay animations, and card information, this is one of the best ways to learn Magic. Magic Duels includes all the best features of the previous Duels of the Planeswalkers games, plus a veritable cornucopia (lol) of features the old games lacked, such as: a wider variety of cards, the ability to 'buy' booster packs with gold you earn in the game (or actually buy as a microtransaction), online battles with both friends and random opponents, and total control over deck customization. New and interesting gameplay modes in the single player campaigns are also a welcome addition; my favorite so far is Liliana vs. her four demons in the Origins campaign.  I have very few problems with Duels, and most of them relate to the clarity and functionality of the GUI. For example, when assigning blocker order, if numbers appeared next to the creatures as you select them, it would be easier to tell the queue order. When making card selections as part of a spell or ability, I am often confused by the buttons 'confirm' vs. 'finish', as well as which cards are selected. The specific functionality of each button should be clearer - perhaps 'confirm [X cards selected]' and 'skip' or 'finish without selecting'. Also, some visual indication of whose turn it is, besides simply the 'opponent's turn'/'your turn' text, would be most welcome, but that's mostly my own laziness talking. Visual shorthand is often more effective in video games than text. I also wish each set had all the cards from its paper counterpart; it seems like that would be extremely simple to do, but it's possible there's a non-public reason to which I'm not privy.  Overall, Magic duels is fun, educational (at least about Magic - though I suppose you could argue for logic and game theory too), well tuned, and highly addictive - just like paper Magic! Quite unlike paper Magic though, Magic Duels is free (and it's tough to beat free)!",

The enemy AI provides a real challenge without being overwhelming in most cases.  The story mode is a nice touch that allows you to engage with the backstory for each set, while also allowing you to use strategies unique to iconic myg planeswalkers which you may not yourself otherwise try out.  The deck wizard feature, which is meant to assist new players in creating certain themed decks is a little lackluster. I felt that halfway through unlocking all the cards of the origins set that my decks were stronger than after finishing unlocking the entire set. Perhaps this is an in-built function meant to encourage players to create their own decks after they've accrued enough experience. But nonetheless, it does feel somewhat clunky.   The regular deck builder could also do with more filtering options, such as searching for certain keywords on cards, but it gets the job done. It just would have been nice to search out synergistic cards with greater ease.  Overall its a pretty fun experience for any MtG fan. But I do think Wizards of the Coast could do with increasing the value of their daily quests. With 4 sets worth of cards to unlock, its a prety daunting task for a new player to unlock all of them, and try to catch up with the meta.",

I love this game, I love the slow progression of building a deck, I love playing with cards you normally only see in limited, and I love the fact that I can just chill back with a controller.  There are some huge downfalls, however, and the biggest is that while Magic Duels is free-to-play, there is a 400 gold cap on PVP matchwins per day and if you're hardcore, this is gonna irk you quite a bit. Also, the interface can get more or less buggy as updates and fixes are released (currently its on the 'more' side), there's no booster draft or sealed deck modes, and even if there were, boosters in Magic Duels are maybe a third of their IRL counterparts and you can only have one per mythic.  Overall, this is a great game and its worth getting into now even though its not the most polished time-waste out there.",

Even if the releases are (were) a little behind the paper version and the occasional bug is found here and there, issues are dealt with swiftly, customer support is very helpful and the overall experience is very gratifying for a free-to-play digital version of this game. Some argue the downsides of the specific format used exclusively in Magic Duels (mythics x1, rares x2 etc), along with the feature of not being able to obtain every single card of the set, but it's obvious that both solve many issues in development and bring the necessary balance to each season's metagame. Honestly, other than the occasional bug (e.g. Endbringer etc) that developers make sure gets corrected as soon as possible anyway, the only cons of the game would be: A) The approximately 100 cards missing from each set, though that too is obviously necessary for the rarity balance needed to obtain the entire set in a specific amount of purchased boosters, and also to do justice to MTGO and the paper version. B) Older sets! We'd love to see older sets being implemented in the game between regular releases even though we understand the volume of work and manhours that would take, but still worth mentioning. As things are, I will not stop recommending this game, and please keep up the good work. We immensely appreciate everything you've done so far.",

I was so hyped when they announced Magic Duels. They were promising great things and I was so excited.  I've played this game for a while and I can say it is okay. There are a lot of great things that Stainless has done right. The deck building is fun, the AI proves to be a challenge sometimes, and going online with your weird brew of the random ♥♥♥♥ you pull out of booster packs is kind of exciting. The new UI is great and the tutorial will train up the newbie into a seasoned spell slinger in no time. It's a great 'Baby's First MTG' experience.  But man is there some nonsense going on sometimes. The RNG is the most ridiculous thing ever. 'Oh you like land?' the game asks you, twirling it's mustache and sipping on a tumbler of Cognac. 'Well,' it responds, 'You can have all the land you need.' It will throw land at you whenever you need it. That is not how a Magical cards deck works RNG. Shame on you. Also the payouts are a little stingy, but they fixed it with the newest update. They left out a trading mechanic (which would be real neat-o) or a marketplace where you can find the cards you want. The older cards are just a bunch of junk commons and uncommons that aren't very good. They give you bad duel lands from sets past (Rootbound Craig as a rare? Wizards please.) Lastly, Wizards or whoever needs to update this game faster. As of this post, Oath of the Gatewatch has been out for a while and there isn't any of the cards in there yet. I want that new Chandra! GIVE ME THAT SWEET CHANDRA WIZARDS  Edit: It took until Shadows got released until I could get that sweet Chandra but whatever I ain't mad.  All in all, the game is solid. With a few changes this could be worthy of a lot of time. But right now, it's only okay.  In true Magic nerd form I'll leave you with a little bragging: I have a foil Jace in this game.

Something that would be nice to see added is functionality to interact with the other player. 1-on-1 private chat in multiplayer (2HG). It's hard when you have an idea but can't express that to your teammate.  Perhaps some teird system to order your decks (Control/Midrange/Agro/Combo etc).

Very frustrating if you are trying to do certain things in the second main phase.  Overall I really enjoy the product and intend to invest more hours into it. I would and have recomended it to many friends.",

When I buy a game I look for value for money, I usually look to get an hour of gameplay for every dollar spent (Thus I adore game franchises like the Witcher and the earlier Elder Scrolls) and when the cost of the game is literally non-existent it's pretty easy to achieve that goal. While I have encountered the occasional glitch and certain game features which limit play compared to the physical version of MTG, they are few and far between, and as a big fan of the Magic series I find it enjoyable to play a free version of the game, and yes while there are micro-transactions they are completely unnecessary to get the booster packs required to make a deck with any sembalance of quality.",

People with the money to spend for coins get that slight advantage over others who can't spare the extra money (coming from a father of two with a third on the way). I still recommend the game, but when people ask about the coin grind, I have to be honest with them.

I still crash in middle of some matches or get stuck during multiplayer but not as much as before. The AI is not as dumb as before. New cards are being brought into the game which made it much better. The only issue I have now is that the cards and packs are so expensive. Also they changed how you get points which is much more annoying they want you to play verses duels everyday in almost 4/5 quests have something to do with dueling single players. That's so boring and annoying perhaps they did a survey noticed that people who are fighting in verses duels everyday are more likely to actually buy cards. But to force everyone to get points by doing so the alienated people who play against the AI and Two headed giant. The fact maybe the verses people do buy more cards but forcing others to go into verses will not increase sales with the people not playing verses. I reluctling go into verses duels to get my points many times I get high ranks which I sometimes even exit to loose my rank in order to make it easier to complete my duels the following day. I try many times to just refresh the quests of verses matches but usually it is no good I still get another one.",

I dunno, to me it just seems like the games are starting to lose the point of what I thought about was fun about mtg in the first place.  I have a deck in physical form, which, among other things, contain the card Mindmoil and the card Niv-Mizzet the Firemind. This basically means that I cycle through my entire deck, casting random spells and deal dmg all over the place to enemies in all directions. Odd combos like these are what makes magic fun and interesting to me.  Duels 2012 had some of the same aspects. I remember equipping Basillisk Collar onto a pestilence demon, accidentally clearing the entire board and gain over 100 hp in the process. Events like these seem neigh impossible with the current cards implemented. It's all just very... Tedious...  Does this mean you won't appreciate the game?

Any game that requires me to be online and then punishes me because the developers don't know how to program gets an automatically downvote.  When the game works, it isn't as bad as the last Duel of the Planeswalkers. The UI is no longer designed by someone who hates people. The cash shop, if the game gives you credit for the games you win, doesn't seem as money-grabbing as the last DotP. A few single player campaign matchups still seem to be designed to frustrate. (The black sacrifice deck with no creatures with power more than 2 against a green deck built around getting counters by other creatures dying seems like a very odd choice to introduce new players to Magic.)

            "review_text": "This is without a doubt the worst game that I have ever played. Don't take such a statement lightly; this is no hyperbole.  Firstly, the launch was outright pathetic. On release, roughly half of the people who wanted to play it could not due to two different crashing errors on startup. Additionally, there was major server instability. This had two major consequences:   since all progress requires a connection to their server, it was impossible to gain and keep gold.   despite 1, the game still checks for local data when it doesn't have a connection. Accidentally choosing to use local data (the consequences of which are not explained to the player) will overwrite all of your data on their server.  So, within the first week many people could hardly play and/or were losing all of their gold/packs. People who didn't fit into this category couldn't even boot up the game successfully. Once the servers became more stable, the game was still riddled with hundreds (probably thousands) of bugs. Here's a short summary of a few:   If your opponent leaves while searching their library, the replacement AI never picks anything and you essentially softlock.   Sometimes opponents cast spells that they simply don't have the mana for. Whether this is hacking or a bug is sometimes hard to discern, but the devs don't seem worried about it either way.   There are a number of cards that straight up don't work in the way that they read. Under very different circumstances this would be more reasonable considering the complexity of MTG.   Two-Headed Giant, the whole reason I wanted to play this game, is all kinds of bugged out. More often than not it will just fail to work and you'll have to retry. Sometimes it will try to load five people into the game and kick your partner as a result.  Sometimes  you'll start the game and your partner will be on the  opposing team . I'd say about 1 in every 30 connection attempts is a successful one.   There is a limit on gold earned per day, this is fine. What is not is that its reset seems to be dependent upon a way in which you talk with the server in an unrelated way. As in, it's fairly unpredictable. Sometimes I'll log on after a week of not playing and see that I've just hit the cap.   There are a lot of minor bugs that I'm either unaware of or I don't have time to explain in this already-lengthy review. Trust me, even these pile up whilst playing.  Worst of all, the communication with the 'community' has been completely awful. More than a week after release someone finally said a fix for the crash on startup error was  in the works . This is the first we heard the devs even hint that they were WORKING on such a fix! Fast forward a few days later, and the same person reported that the fix would take longer than expected. LOL! Some other game-breaking bugs haven't even been acknowledged by the devs. As for all the other bugs, hell will likely freeze over before they even have the time or patience to care. Perhaps after two more years of development time this software could be passable for a game...  But hey, you're reading this in the future, right? Let's say in this hypothetical world that will likely never exist, every bug and performance issue in the game has been resolved. Hooray!

Just the fact that we're now allowed to make our own decks is big improvement. But has the gameplay itself improved?  Unfortunately no. Game is riddled with bugs. I've had my combat phase completely skipped a few times and sometimes I am not allowed to activate abilities or stop the clock even though I normally could.   Another thing is the connection issues. Searching for a game is tedious because it seems that if either player disconnects (which seems to happen way too often) the matchmaking will just stop. Who thought this was a good idea? If there's a disconnect, just reset the matchmaking queue and let the player wait for an actual match, no one wants to press that find opponent button all the time after queue failing.  Technical issues aside, let's get to the game design. User interface is a joke! Why is the stop timer, the most important button in the game, in the lower right corner when I need to keep an eye on the centre of the game? Furthermore, if you game designers put the important UI buttons in a bad place, at least have the decency to force the steam notifications to top right for example... In the genral the UI is pretty bad (menus etc) but the actual action buttons are horrible. Keybindings are necessary in this game so thank goodness for those.  Why do I have to finish a game when my opponent leaves? Frustrating and time consuming, tedious is the key word here. And why is the matchmaking so horrible in general? I get matchmade with lvl 9 accounts when I'm 1. Also aside the matchmaking, the business model is off the records pay to win unless you are really lucky with your booster drops. Even in Hearthstone you can at least craft the cards that you want, but here you just have to wish for good cards.",

One of the biggest issues I have with the game however is that in the story mode it specifcally shows you differn't cards that certain characters will you against you (such as Alhemmerat using fog banks to protect himself to use mill cards on you) However can you use some of these cards to help amplify your decks or give you differn't styles of decks? Nope, in fact the cards are nowhere to be seen, which makes about as much since to me as this game has in general sometimes. Why bother programming the cards to use for a SINGLE campaign level, to then never be touched again, and then just decide to not let players use them? Want to use jace's mill deck or cards? Or how about the eldrazi cards that are used in Nissa's levels? Whelp sorry, even though we programmed them and their here, you cant have them.   The only reason I can think the above statement is the case is if wizards is saving those cards for future expansions and wants more $$$, which honsetly with how this game is, I could see being the case. Although this game is fun, and is technically free, I wish wizards would just go back to the design team for M14 and use that, becouse THAT was a great game, and had tons of fun features and decks to choose from compared to this. Even though this is getting a negative review for many reasons though, I will say that its still something to try out with a friend or maybe even just to play the campaign to learn a little bit of the lore of magic or something.",

I have spent midnight to five in the morning trying not to faceplant into my creatures at a midnight prerelease. I have slaved over a table, building deck, after deck, after deck. I have withdrawn from society to play this game. However, I thought that it would be pretty cool to start playing online. Trust me, it's not. It costs less to get physical cards, and then those cards have the potential to be worth actual money. Heed my warning, head to your local GameStop or card store and grab yourself a starter pack of MtG, and a couple of friends, and have some actual, physical fun. Then, you can sell and trade without having to complete a tutorial or paying for worthtless cards that have no monetary value in the real world.   HOWEVER!!!!!!!!!  If you are a BRAND NEW player with zero cards or money, play through the tutorial, which will adequetly introduce you to the base mechanics of the game. Then, it is worthless. If you want an online experience with a more minimal interface and cards that ARE WORTH REAL MONEY, go to  www.wizards.com/magic/  and download MtGO. You shell out 10 dollars for entry to the game, get some cards, and then you pay the IRL face value for packs, prereleases, drafts, cubes, singles, etc. You can actually trade with people. Then, you can sell your cards to bots and get credits. Just don't get this game.",

The problem is that once you finished story mode (which you can do in one sitting) you are stuck with randomized AI or pvp battles in order to earn the in game currency which in return you need to buy new cards.  The two headed Giant mode (2 vs 2) is completely disfunctional, usually you get stuck on the loading screen or some such. Only current cards are included, which only makes for a handful of deck styles (i.e. black/green elf, red/blue surge, white/green ally, eldrazi, artifact, etc.)  PvP can be very frustrating, since the cards you start out with after story mode are really rather weak but PvP is the by far most effective way to gain coins. Even though it's called ranked, the battles really are not. You do not get paired up with players of your own rank and imo the ranking system is completely disfunctional anyway.  Also, for everyone who doesn't like the Planeswalkers: This is not the game for you. The entire game revolves around them.  I mean, this is a nice enough past time if you have no one to play Magic: The Gathering with irl or are new to the game and want to test the waters, but other than that I'd recommend sticking to the cardboard pieces.",

After testing the game... story mode is not so bad. But the game IS a cash grab, even more worse than Hearthstone, which Magic Duels claims to have followed the same model. I'm sorry, but in Hearthstone... you actually have SOME GOOD CARDS to start. On here, it's just awful.  Oh, and getting boosters (By defenition, a Magic the Gathering booster pack is 15 cards, but on here it's 6 cards, so who cares!) is a drag. Battle mode easy AI are equipped with cards you would DREAM to have - but won't until you play 60 hours of those.  Playing versus players is simple - either you are against people who paid 50$ to get 32 boosters (which is 192 cards... i think i'll buy real life cards, they cost less, thank you), or either you are against the same people as you - which means 20 turns games... for pocket change.  As the game is now, you lose either way.  Oh, and there's daily quests to get coins! Yay.. or not. Because it requires ARCHETYPES deck - so you can customize it A BIT.  Honestly, i'd rather pay 10$ like for Magic 2015 to get the same type of unlocking (get a booster after clearing a story mode mission OR winning a ''random encounter'' in a plane) than this.  Only good point : It was free to test.  As the game is, I CAN'T and WON'T recommend it.  EDIT : After giving the game a second chance, i found out that sometimes, when you manage to do those hassles that are the quests... the coins they give is not always given. Just to add to the list of cons already big enough...  UPDATE (As of 2016-01-27) : Six months later, is the game better?  THE BAD  - Still not getting the right gold amounts from daily quests, or it simply erases what i had saved up to now and gives me the ''correct'' amount. Must have lost like 600 gold this way up to now.  - Hard AI as NO diversity (I do not play against Easy and Medium now.. i mean, 5 or 10 coins a game is so few). By that, i mean : Always splashes white, always play control, as soon as you know which cards do what (Looking at you, Gideon's Reproach), hard is... well, it's 15 coins. When it doesn't bug out.  - Both me and a friend opened a ''phantom'' booster. It shows the cards you got from buying... then no cards in the card collection. Kinda mad since i had finally a Kiora...  I can't believe such bugs still exists many months after the game's launch. Seriously.  THE GOOD  - Battle for Zendikar added some diversity AND some good cards that are actually usable.  - That's it.  Yes, i played about 55 hours because i had faith it could become better. The people managing this game (if there are any other than ''Mod_Chris'', because game content updates are as rare as black lotuses) could probably do much better... or just change the people managing the game. A passionate community managed to do over 3000+ cards over a few months that are all working, why can't a game company paid to do so can't?  Anyway, still not really worth it. Try it if you want though, it IS free-to-play, but i won't ever consider paying them a penny for the game as it is.",

Sadly, this has not been the outcome.  Magic Duels is a game that has so much potential, that it fails to even approach. Free to play card games are generally well recieved in the video game market of 2016, and the amount of money that well made ones make is staggering.  However, for some reason there seems to be a lack of desire or funding on the part of WotC or Stainless, or both, to put together the nessecary resources it takes to produce a functional video game.  Magic Duels has the shell of a great game, but once you look inside you see the blemishes.  Numerous bugs still permeate the play experience. The netcode is slow and frequently does not match players correctly. The game does not allow players to accomplish things that they should be able to do in a game of Magic (such as Transforming a planeswalker with an activated ability in the second main phase). The shuffling algorithms seem off. The game doesn't even teach the correct rules of Magic, instead making stupid conscessions in the name of simplification that instead only serve to misinform.  I really, really, really wanted to write a positive review of this game. I was waiting for the March update and resting judgement until they had a chance to get it released and tuned up. I have given WotC and Stainless every chance to remedy this buggy mess of a game.  Unfortunately, considering the current state of the game, I cannot reccommend anyone play this game, unless you are completely desperate to play Magic on your PC and you don't have the money to play MTGO.

I mean I have no issue with the pay option to get boosters, but the rate to acquire them are just plain atrocious. If facing against AI opponents, a victory garners 15 coins, a booster pack is worth 150. That's an average of 10 duels for 6 cards. Really? You guys couldn't just give us more to work with? The AI are jacked with decks with strategies that clearly outclass you in various degrees. Maybe it was my luck, but playing the same AI through story mode 10 times is not what I call thrilling or enjoyable.   But I will say there is one aspect I deeply enjoyed, Planeswalkers. Finally, it has only taken so many years to get this point. The custom deck builder is fun and user-friendly, but not the deck wizard, it's an abomination of a deck building alghorithm for new players.   Not only that, these Quests (which are like daily things) where the Archetype ones involve using decks from the deck wizard are utterly annoying and not fun at all. But they give you free coins if you can just grind through them. It becomes a chore especially when they are using color combinations where you have not so great cards in those areas.   There is also one other feature I really was ticked about, in the older iterations of Duels, you could stop and pause the clock as an actual setting feature for every phase. Now? They got rid of it. You literally have to have the spazziest hands on this planet to hit either the Space Bar or the Mouse button on the hourglass icon. It's upsetting and while I understand that it streamlines the experience it really takes it away from the more experienced players who want to not worry about missing a chance to react to an effect or spell.   I know I do not have alot of hours logged into this game, but that's because I play physical MtG. And this game does exactly that, it frustrates or inspires players enough to actually buy real booster packs and play the actual game. It's sad when you know that at the end of the day, that's the true aim and goal of this game's current incarnation. I just wish they had actually done some more material with actually more card options besides just Magic Origins. It's a good game to teach new players, but to keep tormenting yourself for enjoyment?

Not only is this version the worst one yet, but also a game with terrible design trends. It's like they looked at their Competition in the market and tried to copy them without thinking why those aspects were implemented in the first place. Hearthstone has booster packs with 5 cards, now so does Magic. Hearthstone uses a daily questing system and gold rewards, now so does Magic.   It makes me sick, it’s just lazy game design. The tutorial as well is horrid, even for this series of games. Ever wonder how trample worked? Well there is a god damn 5 minute long training game dedicated to holding your hand through it.   If it wasn’t free, I would say burn it. But it is free, so if you have an interest in the game and are just starting out, I guess give it a shot. Only until your eyes start bleeding though.  EDIT: Well in light of this review actually getting some attention, allow me to go through some simple pro's and con's to give some qualification behind my silly rant.  Pro's:  +The user interface is probably the best in the series. Considering the last installment's was slow and unresponsive, this is a good thing. +Plot is kinda cool, everybody like planeswalkers +It’s beginners magic, so that could be good  Con’s -Tutorial is terrible. Like really, are player’s not supposed to read cards anymore to figure out what they do? -The cards they give you in the starter have very little synergy for play, resulting in extremely basic decks. -The actual games of the story missions are fairly dull and pre-set. They are more challenges of ordering and playing cards correctly, than a real game of magic.   I have had some issues connecting to their servers as well, but that could simply be up to chance. It should also be noted that there really aren’t too many improvements since the last game. The odd thing about this is that some features that were good have been taken away. Any video game player would know the feeling of a rushed production, and this game oozes it.

Ok so I said I would change this review if the servers ever started working, and they have. I still cant recommend this game though.  Its just not worth your time.   The game is a supposed to be a digital trading card game, but it is not, there is no way to trade cards with other players. This alone wouldn't be that bad, but the only way to get more cards is through opening packs, which give you random cards. See the issue? You have no control over what types of decks you can make, the only way to build a specific deck list is to open packs until you have unlocked every card in the game (132 packs exactly).   Well that shouldn't be an issue, right? you can unlock packs with out paying. all you need to do is win games against other players. Right? Wrong you will win a few games against players who haven't spent money. Since you have won a few games your rank will go up, then you will suddenly start getting matched against players who's decks are loaded with the strongest cards in the game, and then you will stop winning.   Now all this wouldn't even be so bad if you could just spend $10 and get a fairly good deck list and start winning again. How ever you have no control over what cards you will get with that $10. If RNGesus doesn't smile on you and give you strong cards that also have synergy and are in the same colors then you will still be playing at a huge disadvantage.   Throw in that MTGO is still a thing and I just cant see a reason to play this game. sure MTGO is pay 2 win, but at least there you could buy the deck you wanted not just dump money into a slot machine. Also there are tournaments in MTGO, many formats and cards from every set, not just one boring core set.  A large number of players are having issues even getting the game to work at all, I am not one of them, but before you download be aware that you might be.  There is also the issue with multiplayer. If your opponent forfeits you are forced to finish the game out against an AI opponent, MTG can already be kind of tedious if you need to actually get someone's life to 0 even in a one sided stomp, and this game has you wait through a lot of timers (I see why they are needed, so players can react to things on the stacks). The end result is that you will spend a lot of time in games that are already over.  I guess a player who is trying to learn magic might want to try this game just since it has some nice tutorials, but as a game is not fun in and of its self.",

Even some pay-in one-off tournaments (sealed deck, booster draft) would have been a great addition. But instead Magic Duels is dominated by its pay2win nature and its impersonal matches.

I'm a big fan of the trading card game but rarely play because of cost, and have played other computer based TCGs like Hearthstone and Scrolls to try a fill that void. If you are in the same boat and hoping that this will feel like playing Magic for real, you will be sorely disappointed.  The gameply is incredibly slow. Magic is a complex game because it requires interactions on your opponents turn. In order to capture this in a game, you have pauses between every card played, every phase, and so on. I get that this is necessary for PvP duels, but do I really have to sit through it all when playing NPCs in Story mode and the like?  While we are on the topic of story mode, let me just say how frustrating of an experience it is. In addition to being incredibly slow, you have to play with a prebuilt deck that you can't even examine outside of duel. Not only are these decks complete rubbish (and significantly worse than your NPC oppenent's), you have no idea what cards are included in them. Good luck forming strategies like that.  And the icing on this horrible, horrible cake is the game performance. I have a decent laptop that can run popular games like League of Legends, CS:GO, and Skyrim on low to medium settings with around 60 fps. I rarely exceed 14 in this game. The interface is really bizarre. The game table is massive, but the cards are tiny. The default option for the englarged card view is to scroll up on the card. And selecting and playing cards from your hand is awful. I've played the wrong card many times. This is the most basic feature of the game and even that doesn't work well.

If you manage to complete the 3 quests you get you probably can get a pack, but that's the next point... -The quests suck. They basically so far have been 11 quests to win with their terrible deck builder wizard, 1 to target an opponent directly and 1 to win with my own hand built decks that CAN win. Oh and by the way you can only abandon one quest a day. - Poor starting cards, hard to get a decent theme going to even have a chance to win even on easy. - Awkward timing on play. See each hit against the opponent one by one, but when it's time to counter a spell you cant click fast enough. Of course you get a timer each time the opponent plays a card even if you can't actually respond with a spell. - Deck building has very basic filters. Needs some keyword searching or something. - Deck building is unintuitive. Not even a 'save deck' button. They're really pressuring the deck wizards that can't deliver early game. - Story opponents are frequently given the perfect counter deck on non-final bosses. - Edit: Oh forgot to mention, after finally getting a completable quest, completion did not award gold, hence the review/uninstall.

It has a decent portion of the paper cards, but only of the newest sets of 2015. The magic rules are well implemented, I did not witness many gameplay bugs.  The game is free to play.  You begin with tutorials quests for each color, doing a bit of storytelling and explaining how the game works, and giving you the currency of the game as a reward. You are also given the standard starters decks of each color and you can build your deck entirely as you desire between 60 and 100 cards. It has additionnal limitations from the paper game on deckbuilding, the limit of 4 times the same card has been deviated to further reduces the amount of copies of rare cards you are allowed to put in the deck. For example you will be limited to 2 copies of legendary creatures. Winning matches in versus will earn you the game currency against Ai (5-15g) or human (20g) with a limit of 200g per day. Then you can buy boosters for 150g. Boosters will not give you duplicates of a card once you have reached the maximum amount of copies you can fit in a deck. There is no trading cards available. So you will be able to get 6 new cards every day for free as long as you can build a decent deck. You can check magic forums like nogoblinsallowed to get ideas if you are new to this. You will be able to build some solid decks with the basic offered cards.  You can also buy the game currency with real money to unlock a lot of boosters immediately.  gameplay problematic: The starter decks are extremely limited, you will lose a lot of matchups against human oponents that have farmed the game from the start or that have purchased the booster, wich means that you will need to grind a lot of matches to be able to get to your 150g daily gold to buy a booster, which gets quickly dull.  For example the toughest green creature is a vanilla 6/7 for 7 lands, which sucks for a green creature, and especially when a wealthy player will face you with a 6/6, renown 6, for 5 lands, nuke your board with chandra's ignition, and can drop gaia's revenge a bit further down the road. You better play agressive or midrange, because ramp is much better with booster cards.  Now the painful part: Magic games have been around for a while, and the matchmaking is still painfull to go through, it is long and buggy. In 2v2 mode you need to reset the match 2/3 because one player was not connected properly and was replaced by AI. That is especially bad compared to the newcommer of the genre Heartstone. And that hurts a lot more when you know that your deck could be much better and you are not that confident in the actual fight that will happen. The passing of turns and interupt mecanisms forced in the game add a lot of downtime compared to paper magic.  Don't get me wrong, the game is a lot of fun, you can use it to learn how to play magic and get a good idea how to build decks, staregy and tactics, for free. And you can also play it anytime, anywhere as long as you are connected. But I'd rather recommend playing paper magic with your local community if you live in a city, or buy the boosters ASAP to get you to the fun decks adn spare you the painful grind.  So actually the game is more around 32€ if you want to enjoy it.     ",

However, the reason why I can't is because sometimes the game just crashes randomly when you are just about to win a game. It is like the game is saying, 'What? You are about to win? Well F.U!'  I could deal with that. I honestly could. However... I had, five decks. They were deleted when I loaded up the game. I could always recreate the deck, however my point is that I shouldn't have it. When I make a deck, and when I save the deck that I make, I expect it to be there when I get back. NOT deleted.  The only good thing that I can say about it is this; If you are just getting into the game and want to learn how to play, than this game has a really nice beginning tutorial, teaching people how to play. Honestly, if you just want to play through the story and find out the lore of Magic, than by all means. Play this game. However... if you want to play with other people, just buy a starter deck. They are $25 bucks at the most, and you get two packs with the deck. Don't play this game, if you want to play with others.",

            "review_text": "Magic Duels is the latest and final installment in the Planeswalker games. The basic premise of the previous games was $20 Magic game on the computer, which gave you a set of preconstructed decks you could unlock cards for by playing. It was pretty limited, but a low barrier of entry into a normally daunting (and expensive) game. The games were brought down by mediocre UI that was clearly not designed with the PC in mind, netcode which was unreliable at best and a limited number of game modes. Each year we saw much of the same, maybe a new game mode would be added, but ones from last year were oddly absent. New decks were the main draw from year to year, even if many of the basic archetypes and even cards were the same.  With that preamble out of the way, let's dive into the 'new' game. The bones of this game are the same tired ones seen in the previous games, bad netcode, unskippable tutorials, a severely limited set of game modes, and user unfriendly UI. The only saving grace of this game and arguably its predecessors is that at its core, it is still Magic the Gathering a wonderfully deep strategy game. That alone almost makes it worth playing, but you are limited to running through the campaign and either grinding out games against the AI for gold to unlock all the cards, or playing against strangers you can't interact with and who might as well be AI. Playing with friends prevents you from gaining gold as does playing 2 headed giant, one of the most popular modes in the series.   So this leaves you with the 2 options, grind out all the card unlocks basically playing single player and then play the modes which give 0 rewards for playing with your friends or pay around $100 to unlock cards which would have cost $20 if this were a regular release in the series. Doesn't make a whole lot of sense as there is no added value in this release compared to previous offerings.  This game had a lot of potential. If they cleaned up the netcode, put together a snazzy UI, included lots of modes (like all the modes in the previous games and EDH), made it possible to play with friends while still progressing (2HG campaign anyone?), it would be worth playing and kicking in some cash. In its current state, it just isn't very fun or interesting or worth your time. ",

            "review_text": "I'm not going to metion the bugs or the connection issues. The card pool itself is extremly disappointing.  The moment they announced the majority of the cards will come from Magic Origin, I know this will happen. I don’t like playing draft or sealed in paper magic. I don’t like the very idea of “limited”. Why would I want myself be limited in the first place? I do play draft and prerelease occasionally because that’s the only time buying booster packs worth it.  The whole experience of MDO feels like playing sealed even with every card unlocked. The majority of the cards came from Magic Origin means this game has far less cards than a standard game. The power level of cards in this game is downright appalling by comparison with previous DOTP games. Even though previous DOTP game have a card pool of similar size, they have some of the most synergetic or powerful cards from various sets.  Let’s just make some comparison: Comparing the B/G deck with the B/G Sepulchral Strength from DOTP 2013, what we are missing? Are there any cards from this set that are close in power level to Spiritmonger, Pernicious Deed, Greater Good, Maelstrom Pulse. There are not even good commons and uncommons like Blood Artist or Yavimaya Elder. Compare the best elves tribal deck this set can make to the elves tribal deck Sylvan Might from DOTP2014. What MDO can offer can compete with Joraga Warcaller, Ezuri, Renegade Leader, Immaculate Magistrate? For commons and uncommons, what can replace Taunting Elf, Essence Warden, Wellwisher and Imperious Perfect?  By comparing with standard legal elves deck, we are missing Obelisk of Urd and Sylvan Messenger. MDO doesn’t even have Sylvan Messenger, a card previously included in DOTP2014 and reprinted in the very Magic Origin. For goblins the same thing happens to Goblin Piledriver. Again, reprinted in Magic Origin, just not going to let you play. Not mentioning Goblin Warchief, Goblin Chieftain Warren Instigator Krenko , Mob boss and Siege-Gang Commander.  Magic Origin is an enchantment focused set right? What we have in DOTP2013 and 2014 for enchantment? In addition to Sigil of empty throne we had : Daybreak Coronet, Kor Spiritdancer, Pariah+ Indestructibility, Angelic Density, Celestial Mantle. What we have now? Divine Favorand Nimbus Wings for crying out loud.  The mono green Garruk deck in previous iteration had Primordial Hydra, Genesis wave, Avenger of Zendikar and Primeval Titan. Now in MDO, people are considering Outland Colossus OP, Terra Stomper and Gaea's Revenge are the biggest threat green can offer.  MDO is horrendous in card’s quality. The power level of decks are no higher than the decks built using starter toolkit. It is as if they think you don’t deserve good cards. For $15 I can buy any DOTP game+ expansion which have far better cards than MDO, a game require constant investment.    I can't recommend this game to my friends who may or maynot have played magic before becasue it has no charm of MTG at all. It has been polished more like a tablet game than MTG.",

I get it, it's game, it doesn't have the capability of human shuffling. But that was the least of my problems. You see, this bot had a card called Hand of Emrakul, and for those of you who don't know, you can summon one by either paying 9 nonspecific mana or getting rid of 4 Eldrazi-type creatures. So this bot summoned one, and sacrificed 4 eldrazi-type creatures. Then he summoned another. He had 2 eldrazi left, and 7 mana. He sacrificed 2 eldrazi and used 7 mana. In normal Magic, that's not legal. The bot doesn't know how to count, and it'll ALWAYS have a better hand than you. Don't waste your time on this artificially-difficult game.

The fact that these companies no longer need to produce real physical content should inspire them to  make reasonable prices. instead, the chopped the booster pack size down to 30% and render your pretend virtual cards useless every time they re-release the UI update (IE.

I've watched the boards checking for updates and resolutions others have tried, attempting these myself - all with no success. This game, so far, is a huge fail. I could understand if its just my system and a few others but from what I have been able to see, this is a widespread issue in which the programmers still seem to be failing at fixing. It also seems those who are lucky enough to get the game to launch have supreme buggy issues within. Until WOTC really bring the hammer on these folks getting thier mess together, I do not recommend anyone bothering with this game. It seems to be nothing but a terrible user experience all around.",

I've never read the books, but I've played enough of the real thing (both off and on line) and read enough wiki to know enough.  What a piece of shh.... I &lt;3 MtG, and I own all the MtG digital games ever released on XBox. They had their foibles, sure, but this game. This game, just frusterates me to no end. Buggy, glitchy, counter-intuitive, every other 'Skill Quest' doesn't work. Most are missing cards that cause you to fail. Reloading the challenge doesn't fix it. Battles just don't seam to 'flow' right. The settings are very limited, the volume and sound effects are jacked up...  It's not polished. To be considered a real game, this thing is worse than an EA title with a zero day patch...  For any duel, expect to add about 20% longer than it should take because you cannot spead up/skip certain things... For what the 2014 Duels game had, this game really lacks in terms of polish.  The whole origins thing is a very cool aspect. I plan on powering through all these drawbacks to see them, but something tells me that reading the books would probably be easier (and faster) than this game.  For beginning/new players, this game explains everything. Very well, in fact. To the point that I truely wish the 'Skill Quests' worked better; the few that worked for me would have been really helpful and imformitive about 20 years ago when I first started playing.  If this game wasn't preseneted 'Free to Play', I would be demanding my money back. As it is, I'm just left with saddness that here's another thing WotC has ruined.  P.S.

I expected all of that from a pc magic game.   I'm mad that you took time to make a campaign that was mostly well done on the story and video bits but the ♥♥♥♥ing decks that you use are garbage you don't let us see the deck we are about to play with so we don't even know what the best play is should i wait to draw my... ohhh yeah i don't ♥♥♥♥ing know any of the cards the only way to find out is to play each mission three times to see what you draw.   Even then the decks were way too uneven during the Jace storyline there's a mission where you only have one card in your deck that saves you and you have to draw it or you lose while your enemy is milling your deck sooo good luck with that(restart four times till you get the card in your hand)   I know it's too much to ask for from you know a magic videogame because we've seen the quality you continue to put out which is sub par but why can't we make our own selection on cards from the story mode or when you beat a a level instead of throwing random ♥♥♥♥ cards in why not give us the choice of cards to put in?  Also when playing the black story missions you have mana screw almost every game causing you to lose had to restart three or four times each mission just to get four mana in my hand because i could go five rounds and never see another swamp card.   However, the online play is passing which is a first i think? you can do solo matches or play online against randoms or two headed giants which is by far the best feature.   Being able to pay for the cards, or just grind them out the coins are a little pricey considering you will never use them again after this game is outdated; it's not like I'm buying cards in Magic the gathering online or IRL because of that the cards should be much ... much cheaper.  Final Rating 3.5/10  - ♥♥♥♥♥♥ story mode decks and gameplay - Terrible card selection - Tutorials were really annoying they pop up randomly - Possibly paying for cards you'll never use again - Matchmaking can take awhile connection issues - Many people can't play even now it crashes - Brings no joy and nothing new to someone who plays other formats of magic only greif  + Added in some cool lore and stories + Would be a good place to start to learn how to play magic without dumping money into it. + Two headed Giant is Good + Almost every feature in the game works i'd say.. 98% only found one error, others weren't so lucky got lots of bugs ",

(Example: Opponent declared an attack, and before blockers I sacrificed my Black Cat to make him discard his only card, and in response he cast it as an instant to kill another one of my creatures. There was no timer for his instant to respond to. I just lost my creature and the rest of the stack resolved.)  This game also does a VERY poor job of laying out the different phases. When a player passes priority to end a phase the other player(s) will always have a chance to respond. (Example: When an opponent passes his main phase you have the chance to make an action, whether it is kill a creature before it starts attacking or making the opponent lose cards in hand. Not in this game it seems.) The phases also do not account for thinking out a strategy. If you have lands or instants in your hand and you have already laid down a land then the turn will end on you. It will skip your main/second phase and go straight to the end phase. I had an instant to draw cards and it was my end step before I could draw the cards and play any permants that came up. There is also no mention of untap, upkeep, or draw phases which should also has their own end phase responses.  I feel like the developers have no idea how to play magic and have only looked at some brief youtube videos of mtg. Overall I would not recommend this game to any one. Especially new players as this game will give them bad habbits and a poor base idea of mtg.  If you want to play magic online then go google magic online. It takes a bit more to get used to, but it is the closest thing to mtg that you can play virtually.",

Story Mode also supplies you with Coins you can use to buy some boosterpacks, but besides of them and some 'starterboxes' you get, that's it. I thought, the whole point of a 'virtual' Magic-Game would be the big freedom when it comes to deckbuilding. Even though you will be able to build some 'working' decks. I do not want to imagine the time you would have to put into this game in order to get some fine tunes deck where all cards work well together. Constantly fighting NPCs which possess those kind of decks just gets you more frustrated. I know, Magic always also depends on your luck, but especially in the campaign, it sometimes feels like you couldn't even have won a battle with the cards provided. So you play again and hope for a better hand. The last issue is how the different phases of your turn klick into one another. I still havent found out how you can distribute your creatures damage when multiple enemy creatures are blocking your creature. The game always does this by itself, which might give you results you don't want. In addition, sometimes it is very hard and/or confusing to find the right moment, when to use your instants. ",

I have played this game a lot ( over 500 hrs), someone new to this game has no choice but to 'Buy in' or be bored to death as you painfully grind for a meager amount of coins from playing the computer. The coins you 'earn' by playing the computer is simply not enough to be rewarding. You can complete tutorials and earn coins, but it takes a signifigant time investment, another way for the game to 'hook' you in. Combine this with the fact that booster packs that you can buy from the store for coins, only have 6 cards in them! Again this is by design to keep you grinding and buying. If you are a wallet warrior and have nothing better to spend your hard earned money on, then go for it! If not you will be DOMINATED by those same wallet warriors who ponnied up to win. This causes the game to be broken and unballanced. The 'random' generated draw phase leaves you screwed for mana most of the time, and forces you to be beat because of a crappy hand OR to quit, which lowers your rank AND nets you nothing for the trouble! Again back to the grind( See the pattern here?) The 'ranking' system is a joke as you can only reach rank 40 and there is no incentive to keep playing in versus matches after that, you just wait for the next set to release and rinse and repeat. A COMPLETE TIME KILL AND MONEY SPONGE. If you love MTG, good for you but this game does not support its player population but rather relies on churn to keep making money.

I've heard about the hold priority issues, and basically how the devs catered to new players who don't know the rules to this game rather than the loyal fanbase who got them this far. However, I LITERALLY cannot even play a single game. It hangs on the loading screen PERMANENTLY if I try, and I have to use the Task Manager to exit the game. Then, I get told 'Oh, the deck was made before the new release. It's bugged out, so delete it and make a new one. Also, don't use X, Y and Z, and don't do A, B &amp; C, because they cause problems.'  Then, the video was released. Look on the discussion page, as I won't bother linking such profuse garbage, but if you want to know the exact words used... look it up for yourself. Either way, the concise version is that rather than actually fix the game, the dev team is working on the new release!

I also really enjoy 2HG and wanted to start wrecking fools wih my friends.  However, when I launch the game it basically says, 'F-you.' My game crashes every time with a 'Fatal Error' and the description of that error is 'Uknown Error'. Is this a joke? No, sadly it isn't.  This is basically a glorified Flash game and WoTC still cannot get it right. Maybe my PC can't handle the game?  My PC: Windows 7 64 bit i5-4670K GTX 970 16GB RAM  Yup, that must be it. I should not have underestimated the resource hungry Magic Duels. I'll update my review once I upgrade to SLI Titans.  TL;DR This launch was actually worse than Arkham Knight's. At least in that game you can get to the game menu.  EDIT: I finally was able to get this game to work. I had to download Service Pack 1 and a specific update (KB 2670838). However, I still do not recommend the game. The graphics are horrendous (honestly, the 'table' that they have you play on looks it was made in Powerpoint) and the card selection is awful. No, I'm not talking about the cards you have initially. I'm talking about all the available cards possible. 2/2 bears for days.  EDIT 2: Meh, the game has 2HG so I may stick with it for a bit.",

However, there are a few flaws.  - The campaign can be irritating. The decks are pre-assembled and sometimes your opponent's deck is stacked against yours leading to aggrevating matches. A few times I had to play a match over and over and only won because the opponent kept a poor hand.  - The quest feature is thoroughly agonizing. Many of the quests asks you to use the game's deck wizard to build 'theme decks.' The problem is that as a starter you don't have the right cards to build on the theme they FORCE you to build on. (Even though this is mildly mitigated by the fact that you can complete quests by playing against the computer, you'll have to fight them repeatedly due to losing with your poorly made, frankenstein theme decks.)  - There's still connectivity issues. I got zero credit for winning a duel because I lost connection. (Maybe they gave me credit when I was finally reconnected, but it's still annoying.)  - Crucial moments when you want to really watch the field moves too fast. During combat there's a lot of tense watching. When to attack, when the opposing side blocks, it's hard to tell when you can respond with your instances and abilities. A lot of the time the phase moves too fast and I miss my timing to make counterplays.  Gripes aside it's still Magic game. If you like Magic I'm sure you'll enjoy it on some level.

            "review_text": "I've been playing for a while now, and I played many hours of the previous Duels of the Planeswalkers games, at the game's urging I am finally writing a review.  Pros:  If you are a fan of MtG, and want to play an online version, this is the best-looking interface out there by far.  It is free-to-play, and daily quests and rewards for multiplayer victories allow you to buy boosters at a pretty steady pace, even if you spend no money. You could even grind against the AI if you wish to do so.  They are releasing content that is contained in the current paper magic sets, which is pretty cool. They slipped up with Oath of the Gatewatch, choosing not to release it at all until the release of Shadows over Innistrad, but perhaps going into the future they'll consistently release content contemporaneous with the paper sets.  Cons:   The game is pretty buggy. Multiplayer can lock up quite a bit when it looks for a new player. Most frustratingly, there are points when you cannot exit matchmaking if its taking way longer than is acceptable, forcing you to close the program entirely. I was unable to even play single player matches after the latest update until I learned that in order to make it work properly I had to delete all my decks and make them over again. It wasn't the end of the world, but it was extremely dumb.  Whenever you go into your collection, a pop-up appears inviting you to the Magic Duels store. There is no way to make that go away that I can find in the game. Additionally, whenever you win your first online match of the day, another pop up appears inviting you to write a review about the game. In fact, the reason I am writing this now is in the hopes that I can make one of the pop ups dissapear forever, because they become extremely annoying after a while.  There is a cool feature introduced in multiplayer that when a player quits the match it gives you the option to keep playing or to exit the match, with the assurance that your rewards will stay the same regardless. The problem is that it only happens some of the time, and the rest of the time you have to finish the match against the computer (or let's just say I finish it out just to be sure I get my rewards.) Why does this happen?  While the GUI is the best that an online Magic game has ever had, it is nowhere near as good as the one for Hearthstone. The difference in animation, sound, and overall presentation is pretty sizeable. Not that it's bad necessarily, but it could be better.   The game gives out daily quests, which is good, but some types of quests can only be completed with decks made using the Deck Wizard (a guided process that does not allow you full customization options for your deck). While it's true you can cycle those quests away, IMO there should not be such a restriction on those types of quests that they don't even explain is there. I only found about it through the forums. Regardless, progress achieved in a quest should count regardless of the process used in creating the deck that fulfilled the requirement. The fact that it doesn't happen is pretty ridiculous.  Conclusion:   While I enjoy the game, I was torn on what review to give it. IMO it still doesn't compete with its largest competitor, Hearthstone, but if you're a fan of MtG, this is the most fun way to play it outside of paper. Ultimately I would only recommend playing it if you're already a fan or want to try the game out for free. In either case, though, I would not recommend spending money on it. I have not spent a penny on it and do not plan to in the near future. So I guess I can't really recommend it if in doing so, people would then start paying into it. It is not really there as a game that deserves that at this point in time. However, if you establish that you will just enjoy the game for what it is, like I do, and don't feel the pull to spend money on it, you can have some fun.  *Update*  Once again, persistent pop-ups asking me to leave a review (though I already left one) pull me back here to update my old review in the vain hope that the developers will actually read it and make them go away in the future. This aspect of the game has not been improved unfortunately, but other really annoying issues about the game have been fixed, such as the ability for players to pause the game and leave, forcing you to either remain in the game forever, or quit the game and take a loss. Also, obviously, there is more new content with the new set. I don't want to go too in depth about the good or bad aspects (as I aleady have), but suffice to say you may only find yourself getting really into this game if you are particularly interested in playing Magic (which I am), but due to the game's shortcomings and issues still unfixed after several months it is hard for me to recommend the game to general players, and certainly not to spend money in.",

Another thing, the stupid phase timer gives you a whole 'generous' 1 second to stop the timer before the game moves on without you. This is not a game I would spend money on nor recommend a friend to spend money on either.

But it's not, only a short glimpse.. It has some catastrophic dark sides.. As it would have been a community game.. But only works okay against stupid or broken bots, sometimes not even this, ehh. So im having some good moments in the strict regulated and preseted 'Story modes' where you play preset games against AI. This have been pretty ok.  Otherwise, versus real players, it's more or less catastrophic. Where still today in May 2016 about 70% of all games ends with connection problems, Rage quitters, or strange disconnects, or bugs crashing/hanging the game. So after waiting in game queue for 3-35 minutes, the match starts without any notifications what so ever, resulting in even more lost games due to afkers, quitters etc... This is the only game i have that suffers this badly from it, by far.  If you actually want to win games at all and not get pawn sourced aka Chuck Norris Eye stared instagibb 50cal farmed. You would have to spend about 22-80 Euros on DLC random boosterpacks. You pay about 1,79 euro for 6 random cards, that you probably can't use anyway. For my last 3 boosters, 1 card shared my 2 colour card deck. You need atleast 60 cards in one set, and there are about 6 different colour types. You will get some few cards for free, but they will not change your win ability,, much. So spending a less fortune on a cardbuild capable to win - if you do not have the patience to grind through 900 ragequits, DCs, crashes etc etc.  You do this, just so you will be able to get rekted by the UNRANKED matchmaking system using the same amount of sympathy that space does to orbiting elephants inside our very sun.. Be smart and buy the real cards and meet real people instead.   This game DOES NOT support any form of commuications aka chat or voicefunction, at all.. It's fun playing the story mode, listening to the music for a little while if you already belong to the magic community, if not, braindamage will be imminent.   Sory me bad englesh!",

The UI is horrendous. there is a timer that waits 3-5 seconds between anything which seems like forever when you want to just play through, but not nearly enough time to react when you want to do something. you can stop the timer to react to something, however with how slow the game moves if you aren't special forces trained to keep watch for anything, you're going to miss it.  2. If you click on anything, anything at all, it plays the card no take-backs. Finger slipped? Looks like you just lost the whole game.  3. Mandatory tutorial. you already know how to play a game that has been around for over 2 decades? Too bad, sit tight and roll your eyes as you are told how to play a basic land card. Great if you are new, but tedious if you aren't. Also, don't try and rush through the tutorial, since if you don't do EXACTLY as the AI wants, you have to redo whatever you messed up.  4. Difficulty for AI is all over the place. The tutorial campaign is easy, i never lost a match. Then I go into battle which has three difficulties: Easy, Medium, and Hard. Let me rephrase that though, easy, medium, and hard for experienced players. You are new to magic altogether, or looking for a casual game? The AI will crush you on Easy. You don't start off with too many card choices for your deck, so getting started is difficult, and you need to win against the AI if you want to get started.  5. Server connection issues. This is the most major issue I had. if you lose connection with the server DO NOT CONTINUE OFFLINE. just leave the game. I had to redo the entire Gideon (tutorial) campaign to unlock the abilityto actually play the game because I lost connection to the servers and it decided not to trust my offline files. I made a deck during this time too, gone.  --------------------------------------------------  Pros:  ... free to play? I guess?  Mostly, once you get past the tutorial level, get a good start in the game, and adjust to the terrible interface the game gets a lot better. I was split on reccomending this game or not, and chose not to simply because of how split I was. I would give it a 6/10, maybe a 5. That jumps up quite far if they make easy difficulty actually 'don't bother turning your brain on' or 'beginner friendly' and change how that timer works.",

Unlike the previous games of the series were you could unlock 90% of the cards by playing through the challanges and then go online and have some fun. in this one you get a starter set of largely useless cards and the challanges only give you enough gold for a very smal amount of boosters. were before you would get a seeded booster everytime you beat a challenge you now get 10 gold for the first and a bit more for the later challanges while a booster costs 150 gold.  they clearly messed up the progression system in order to get you to buy boosters at the ridiculous price of 1,70 a pack  in conclusion: Magic is a great cardgame, Duels is a horribly bland cashin that profits of the amazing cardgame and adds nothing of value. save your self the time and money go to a store near you and play the cardgame, its better and cheaper.",

No game is like MTG but grind curve here must be so amazing, that i dont rather play it. Gameplay is descent. Quest are ok. good for beginners in mtg.  Starter pack is ok for beginers but for pro player that starter pack is just the biggest crap you can actualy get :D its amazing of you you cannot posibly make any competative deck, so your basicaly stuck to Portal type of a cards to like get you hand of a basic abilities :D so your stuck to grind. remeber, you dont need one rare you need four rares of the same type. And yes i got 3x boosters for finishing 1 quest that is made out of a 5 games. so for 5 quest games against npc i got 3xboosters with 6 cards, seems not every boster containing a rare card (might be wrong on this one).  Good for ppl that like to grind as horses and on top of that, they even like to buy electronic card boosters (not cards). Sad couse i realy dont have time for that what i would realy expect from online Magic is: all cards, with strong tournaments, than you could pay for real tournament to test deck in like real prize tournament.  I saw no tournament mode, since this aint beta anymore, i think they just skipped element of draft and tournaments.  But honestly its not a bad game! Worth checking out if you are new to mtg!

I would NOT recommend because: -- The game does not include the actual Origins booster set; but rather a 80% Origins 20% older card mix because the creators are so scared everyone would stop buying physical cards if they included the actual set. -- You can only buy boosters or gold for real money in the Store; and you get no discount for bulk-buying your boosters.(Though the boosters are 'smart' and designed to only give you cards you don't have to complete your collection). -- After you complete your first campaign (Gideon); subsequent campaigns only offer basic gold-per-level rewards; no completion of campaign rewards which makes all the hours you may spend on it kind of a wasted effort.

Sure you need a way to give the opponet the chance to react, but a forced stand still for 3 sec. is to long in the case that nobody did anything and it is pretty short if your opponet does something critcal and you got to react. In that case you better hit the instant button quickly, bevore you start thinking, otherwise you might be to slow. In the course of a game the interrupts where nothing happnes add up to minutes and if you play a lot, to hours. Also the card pool is really small and the reward for playing is minimal. Of course it's a p2win game, but for that price I rather buy real Boosters and play with a person that sits in front of me and can actually speak with me while we play. There is no chat in multiplayer, so you can't even say hello and there is no possibility for a rematch if you loose. In most cases this does no matter anyway, because it's a wide spread behavior to leave the game as soon as the game looks like a loss. Also there are disconnects on a regular basis that sometimes last for many hours (like now, so i have plenty of time to write this review). Besides of the actual game, the Forum support is minimal, and most die hard fans left the official forum long ago. So as long as you have someone to play with real cards, better spend your money on real Boosters. And if you insist on playing it, don't spend your money right away, it's free to play after all.  After 60 hours playtime I am writing an update today because there are some very frustrating bugs/issues with it, that you only find out after a while of playing. What upsets me most is that the AI is simple and plainly cheating. The AI knows it's library from top to bottom and plays that to it's own advantage. And is does it in a very obvious way. Every time the AI is playing a spell that gives it the ability to search the x top cards of it's library, it pays exactly the right amount to get the card it is looking for ( Most of the time it plays the x cost as 1) and in 60 hours of playtime it never ever a single time failed an attempt. For example, it is looking for a land, pays x = 1 and the top card is a land, if it is looking for a creature it pays x = 3 and the third card will be a creature. After a couple of dozens successful attempts with not a single fail the chance for it to be luck is negligible. What is also very frustrating is, that there is no battle log. Sometimes things are happening pretty fast, when you and the AI play instants during a combat with multiple creatures and in the damage resolution you only have 3 sec. time to understand what just happened. That sometimes is simply to short. Sometimes i also loose a creature in battle and can't explain how that just happened, that is just simply annoying",

However, the decision to go with a game that was entirely Cloud-based - meaning no local saves, and no ability to save locally when not connected to the Internet - was a terrible one, and it produced disastrous results when servers don't work. I've had numerous 'You're Offline' messages despite a robust and stable Internet connection. I even plugged it into a hardline and it still told me I was offline! That's the point where the game gets put down and never touched again. The lack of a local save function in this day and age is inexcusable.

This series has had 5 years and every single release is buggy and has issues with saves, card bugs, etc.  So far, the servers in this version are up and down due to a bug allowing people to 'buy' tons of gold on the shop without actually being charged.  Myself and a handful of others i've been chatting with have lost the 3 initial free boosters you receive after completing the tutorial. We opened them and added the cards to the collection, but the cards disspeared after the next login. The game's store links as of this review have been removed, although if you have a link you are able to get to the store page still.  Lots of users are experiencing crashes, and i can confirm at least a few cards within one hour of playing that don't even trigger their abilities correctly.   The gold and campaign progress appear to be stored on stainless' servers, which is why you can't access either of them while not connected to the service. The card unlocks are unknown, but could be tied to a local save which would expllain losing the initial booster contents (though the 3 unopened packs should have been given back..). I know decks at least are stored locally, as i got the dreaded 'Choose your save file' from steam cloud once reconnected (note that i didn't know i was disconnected beforehand). I chose local and it still had my deck, but it kept asking me every time i logged back in so eventually i chose the cloud save. This stopped the prompting but i lost the deck.   Combine these frustrations that happen every single duels release with the fact that stainless or wizards don't talk to the community at all until it's too late, and i can't reccomend this game at this time. I skipped the last years version because of issues like this, and swore i'd never buy another one. I decided to try this due to it being free and thinking ok, maybe they're going to take a note from Blizzard and make a solid experience.   As far as features go, the hold priority option is missing, which is sad as it was in the original Duels of the planeswalkers. There aren't proper beginning or end steps, but's the usual for this series. There's NO chat, so you can't even text communicate with your opponent or partners. No voice chat either.  I'll gladly update the review when all this crap is fixed, but until then either stay away or take my advice and don't spend any real money on it, you never know if your cards will stick around at this point.",

Secondly, it would be so easy to sell real, physical cards that are preregistered so you could have at least some minimal value out of your purchases. Years ago WOTC would have felt the earned loyalty to the owned cards would have helped ensure brand loyalty.  The company suggests that you can earn cards by playing through the preset decks but that is utterly rediculous as the deck you play against is preset much higher than the deck you play. Many of the sources for earned packs are impassable unless some unlucky deal completely blocks or mana starves the opponent. you can spend 30 - 50 turns at one level 30 play or 10 to 20 hours just to get 1/5 of a pack of 8 cards. The most frustrating times of your life, why suffer for their game? So you eventually decide to pay for cards and find that like all packs of MTG 80% of every pack is utterly useless.   Eventually (hopefully before too long) you realize the greed motives of WOTC are so excessive that the whole process is a bad idea. Oh well I had high hopes.  Also if you do play on you will find yourself matched against players with much higher ranks probably because there are so few players online; that is also very frustrating.   Ah general discourse on current deckbuilding. The combinations are more simplistic than the old Tempest days. New abilities are cooked in rather than really clever twists.

It had an special feeling to it, charisma, you wanted to get into the game to hunt back garruk (knowing who he was or not) People talk about connectivy issues, card pools or gold shennanigans. But the biggest problem this game has is it's lack of spirit.  They made this to try and counter the effects of hearthstone have done to the online TCG, but in their attempt, they made a game without the charisma HS has. The menus are simple circles in a row to press, the interface itself are different sprites put in a void space floating around. The only good thing of this interface is the pointer, yes. Even small things like the store is way better HS, look at the area where you open your packs in HS, is really cool. Here, we have a blank rectangle and a (bad animated) pack being tear appart and removed. The smallest thing of having to turn around each card is exciting in HS, here... just 6 rectangles with pictures are spread over the plain black rectangle behind them.  The music was extremelly more interesting in DotP2015, the lack of voice acting when you play makes you feel like you're playing in the void of the space with the same music recording over and over again. The intro and outro of each match is unoriginal at best. And a side note on this, why would you want to finnish your game against the AI? I just want to win, finnish the game, give me the gold and the rank and let me start another match!  I love magic but I hate what wizards and the bad company that stainlessgames is do to the franchise every year, if I were the one to make the decision I would pull down this mess, give the game to better company and take back all the art and spirit DotP2015 had, with their black/white+color scheme, the impactful music and improve all the issues it had, like the menus, add a better store and pack-openning zone, a more fluent deck-builder, the option to ignore phases for the more advanced players and a lot more voice acting.",

But this game falls flat on its face hard. The other reviews are correct when they the servers lose connection often, and the it is impossible to meet new people online, because you are unable to see others gametags or even invite your friends. However, that is not even my biggest problem with the game. MtG is known for being the 1st and most complex game in its genre. Yet all the cards in this are BORING AS ****. Where is the innovation? Where are the interest abilities? Where are the Planeswalkers?  I don't know if I can ever recommand an online game from WotC, because they will never see it is as good as it is on paper. Their online games will forever be a commercial for their phsyical cards. I can understand they don't want their hardcore players to move to online.

Be among the first full card-pool players ;)  If they get it fixed with more booster series this will easily be 12/10.   Sadly, as expected, nothing happens to this game. Maybe with the next card-update. But the dev already proved in the past how they tend to fix things... 05/10 it's magic but still poorly executed    Attention. There is a review that pretends F2P is RipOff. This is NOT true. Just read the comments.  (You can click on recommended / not r.)   At this point server disconnections seem to be pretty seldom. So there are still a lot of things to fix but it is obvious they are improving things.  So, everyone should give this a try. If they fix the bugs this will be the No 1 ccg since comparing magic rules to those that blizzzard game uses is like comparing chess to bingo.  Concerning the negative reviews: For the most there are complaints about two of major things.  First the servers and need to be online for rewards - inevitably needed for a game like this. (And noone has ever complained about hearthstone...).  Second thing were control issues - maybe play and read the tutorial???? Obviously they did not... TBH this is the first magic game where i did not encounter a bug with autoending reaction phase for instants etc. (I did not play M15 for obvious reasons.)  Playing the game I encountered several interaction fails but I hope those will be fixed. Speaking of the latter I wished the devs would have an easy way to communicate bugs to them. I did not find them on the quick. You can report bugs in the steam forum but i think its more related to technical issues.  What needs to be fixed ASAP is auto-ending of current phase when you can't play a card (so your opponent will know you do not have certain types of cards).",

However for now just pretend it's in beta.  The Positive: Good tutorial Build your own decks 2 Headed Giant  The Negative: Limited starting options for building your own decks Only one 6 card booster pack 2 Headed Giant doesn't give any points  Review: The game starts off fine, you play some skill quests and story mode which is challenging. When you finish story mode you'll have saved up some gold to buy some boosters, if you're lucky you'll get some nice cards to help build your own decks. Since you only get 6 cards from one booster you won't have a lot of cards to choose from and very limited strategy early on in the game. It is easy to get stuck in a loosing streak, if your decks just aren't strong enough to beat the CPU and you cannot get the daily bonus quest. When you are stuck with weak decks it is very hard to earn gold which makes it harder to get new cards which means you progress very slowly. The satisfaction of progression is very important in games, something a lot of companies have forgotten.  My Wishes: Theme Decks and/or Intro Packs (Which are great to use as a core for your own decks) Propper 15 card Booster packs (the extra commons will give you a wider choice for your deck building)  Fun Idea: I thought it might be a fun idea if you could change a cards style to old style magic cards, similar to the way you can foil a card.  Comment: They should really stick to 2d animation and leave 3d animation to companies like Blizzard.",

There is no reason to play your friends...neither one gets anything but bragging rights ...... play spell that allows your to take card out of opponents graveyard and become yours, cool but be carefull that its not a card that can change/evolve or whatever, if it does you loose control of it. btw that is not the way the game is played when you play it with the actual cards..... pay to win players dominate the field with decks that dont need any cards...they already paid for them .... so the free to play or low pay players stay at the bottom hoping to land rare game against each other so they might have chance to earn 20of the 150 coins needed for less then half what normal booster pack has if your lucky you can earn one these every 2-3 hrs and get 6 cards that dont help after 5-6 of these if your lucky you end up with one card you can actually use to improve the best deck you have, which gets slapped around most the time....  There are several of the rare cards inclulding most of the Planeswalkers abilities that dont work, examples include a planeswalker that for -3 allows you to cast instant or sorcery from your graveyard, it takes the -3 and marks the card but you cant play it, there is green elemental that is suppose to be able to exile it instead of putting it into your graveyard when it dies to return any card from your graveyard to your hand, it exiles the card and marks it but wont return it.... there is no way to communicate with your opponent or trade cards with anyone turning what should be a community of players into solo games that may or may not against another player but feels like your playing buy yourself i continue to play only because i like to play magic, this is close and free...",

Magic Duels has one kind of currency and you can only get new cards by buying booster packs. Pure and simple. It feels honest.  The Bad: Less honest is the way the AI for Magic Duels feels. Theres no other way to say this: It cheats. No really. It cheats. It knows what cards you have in your deck and in your hand at any given time and I've personally seen it have more than 4 cards of the same excact kind in its deck. It has an infuriating habbit of pulling a rabbit out of its hat, and just happen to have the excact card it needs to foil your plans. I know developers has to make up for AIs just not being able to put up as good a challange as real people but I really wish they would have spent more time on this AI.

I have been playing this wonderful game [Magic the Gathering] since the beginning and even then Mr. Garfield put it through its 'Alpha' 'Beta' paces...there hasn't been a good play style since Tempest and even that was destroyed by over printing...good thing there are still great artists used for most of the cards or well...I would have left this mess a long time ago...another blunder for the MTG WoTC team.

In the story mode, you follow the origins of each of the five planeswalkers. After I finished with the last game in the first story line, the game locked up. Not only that, I couldn't get to Task Master to close the program, and clicking on close window in the task bar did nothing. Then, when I tried to restart the computer, it went black, but never restarted. I had to pull the battery in order to get the game to restart.  This game is NOT ready for prime time.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   This is just my initial impression.  I'm playing the game on a Dell Venue Pro running Windows 10. Basically a Window ten inch tablet running full Windows.  The game can be played, at least through the begining story scenarios, using just fingers on the touchscreen. This is an improvement over MTGO, which cannot be played without a mouse and a reasonable sized monitor. The cards are legible. So this game is portable. That's the good news.  The bad news is that it doesn't work well. A lot of actions require double clicks, and the mouse is far more precise than my finger tips. since the game is available for other tablets, it would be nice is it used the same user interface. Also, the game (as well as the Steam application) doesn't support normal tablet functionality, such as screen rotation or shrinking and growing the screen. (Heck, Steam doesn't even let you scroll down the page without attempting to use the small scroll bar on the side.)  As a way to play a subset of Magic while away from your computer, I'd say it's usable. But it has a way to go before I'd strongly recommend it.",

Some core MTG mechanics are different than the physical game, and there are a lot of bugs. I'm not going to reiterate these, just scroll through the reviews.  The thing that is truely bothersome is the lack of draft play. The way the game is set up now makes it hard for new players to play online without hours and hours of grinding for cards (or paying lots of money for 6-card booster packs) to catch up with people who have been playing for a year or more. The game could clearly become a REMARKABLE Magic Draft game though.  I go into my thoughts on how a draft feature should be implemented below, while still giving the devs a solid cash flow. _______________________________________________________  Keeping in mind a retail booster pack costs ~$4, the draft could be set up such that:  A player pays $8 to participate in a draft. Drafts would only be available bi-weekly. The draft would have 8 players, and would first prioritize connecting with invited friends, then fill in any remaining slots with Random Online Players or AI.  Once the lobby has been set up, the draft is setup just like in real life - each player gets 3 booster packs of 15 cards, players pick one card and pass the rest of the booster around the table, etc. As Duels games have been incredibly lame for making non-randomized boosters in the past, these boosters would need to be randomized - eg, any card in the set should be a possibilty! It should be just like opening real life boosters in a draft!  Once the draft is done, the lobby is disconnected and players can create their draft deck. The player would be able to use this draft deck for 2 weeks, in a mode called Draft VS. However, if a player wants to keep the cards he drafted and add them to his collection for use in constructed games, the player could pay another $4 to add the cards to his collection. Once the cards are added to his collection, they can be used in constructed modes forever. However, after the two week period, or whenever the next bi-weekly draft cycle starts, (regardless of whether the player is going to participate in a draft or not) the cards obtained in the prior draft would not be usable in Draft VS anymore.    Draft VS is a mode where players can play against Friends or Online Players Draft Decks. - Only Draft Decks would be usauble here - It should include 1v1 and 2-Headed Giant.    If the devs fixed the issues other reviewers have mentioned, and added the draft feature, it would be an INCREDIBLY good title - and a moneymaker.",

In the previous games, you could also say there was no reason. There was no reward (other than maybe a card unlock if you haven't completed that). But because the entire point of the game was to quickly get a good deck and play Magic, it was a fun system. But in this game, you cannot quickly get a good deck.

            "review_text": "Updated: May 29, 2016   They STILL haven't fixed the bogus RNG... At this point I must regretfully mark this as 'NOT Recommended.' There's just nothing to enjoy.    This game  really  walks the line between recommend or not. Sometimes its a very enjoyable game that represents MTG very well. Othertimes, its slanted AI and RNG make you want to throw your computer across the room.  The Lilliana campaign, unless you get really lucky, will probably cause you to pull your hair out. And you won't be losing because you're bad, you'll be losing because of bad design on Magic Duels' design of the campaign.  It completely lacks the random feel or drawing in a physical MTG match, and with the pathetic pre-made story decks, you aren't really able to form a cohesive strategy. It's not enjoyable. The rewards are not worth the frustration the game puts on you.   You're much better off playing on Untap, or even MTG:O if you have the cash.  Even as a free game, this isn't enjoyable. Unless you're constantly playing a friend, skip this one.   Pros:   Story Mode, which explores the origins of the most popular Planeswalkers. Very cool.   Gold can be earned to unlock boosters   Boosters are also easily unlocked in Story Mode   2 Headed Giant   AI and Multiplayer options   Create your own decks   Decent production, sound, artwork, interface.   The ability to earn gold by completing quests against AI or Humans.  This is a big deal when comparing to Hearthstone, in which that game makes you play against human players to earn your gold. MTG takes a less money-grubbing approach.    Cons:   Infuriating, and annoying tooltips, that will interrupt you NON-STOP. I even tried the 'Don't tell me this again option,' and it just keeps popping up. Devs: fix this crap. Its annoying enough to make someone flip tables.   AI is clearly favored with RNG.   Let me explain:   A common trait i've noticed in all the MTG games released on mobile devices and PC is that the AI will 9/10 times get that card they need, almost every turn. Don't get it twisted. I've played numerous card games on PC/Mobile, and MTG is always the prime offender. I've played Hearthstone extensively over the passed few years, and its RNG seems truly random to me. MTG, on the other hand, always favors the AI while giving you the truly random RNG. I play many MTG games in person, and with friends online using different mediums, but the MTG games released on these platforms, by this publisher always finds a way to mess with AI RNG. It's incredibly frustrating. Devs: FIX IT!   Crashes. They happen frequently. I was on the winning attack phase for my turn, and upon clicking 'Attack with all' to seal the game, it crashed... Very frustrating. Devs: FIX IT!   No point in buying multiple packs. If MTG is trying to keep up with Hearthstone, your shop needs to have a bonus for buying multiple packs. Even buying multiple packs with in-game gold in Hearthstone results in you netting a bonus. This is more opinion, than a true Con, as im sure it doesn't matter to everyone. But it matters to me.    The Deck Building Assistant is a troll. For ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles, I used this, just to explore the feature. Between the AI RNG mentioned above, and the AI deck building assistant, I was set up to be one of the most hilarious sacrifices to the AI I've ever seen. Hearthstone heroic challenges were less slanted than the mess I encountered. It made no effort to build a synergistic deck with the cards I had accumulated with multiple booster packs opened. It was laughable.    Summary: The game has some MAJOR problems with its campaign design, and the slanted RNG and AI elements are very obvious. These problems are less obvious in the regular battle-modes vs the AI, opposed to the crushing campaign. This version of MTG is great for playing against friends who don't want to drop money on anything, but also allows everyone a chance to invest time OR money in opening boosters and deepening the game. The Interface isn't perfect, but it works very well. If Magic: The Gathering would continue to focus on this version, and polish it, and push for promotion and perfection, this could be the Magic: The Gathering Online that everyone wants, as opposed to their current MTGO which is a complete dinosaur.",

            "review_text": "This game is good but it's got a fatal flaw. When you play multiplayer, people keep exploiting the fact that you can let the timer run down, so people will go out of their way to waste your time. They will let the timer run down for every phase of their turn, they will pause during actions over and over again. A single turn can take minutes when it should take seconds. If someone tried to pull this stunt in real life they would get kicked in the face. It really makes the game almost unplayable. I suggest you steer clear of this game unless the developers add some way to report people for abusing the timer system. It ruins the experience. I know sometimes it's a bug, that people just can't do anything, but other times, it's pretty clear that the opponent is intentionally trying to waste your time so that you will quit in frustration, which gives them a win and some coins. Whenever this happens I tab out and watch a youtube video for a while. I refuse to give them the satisfaction. If they want to waste my time, I will make them waste their own time too. I have better things to do than deal with these immature cheating scum.",

Some of the 'story' premade decks you're forced to play are utter ♥♥♥♥. The premade aggro decks often have slower kills than the control decks... Against an empty board... You will get land screwed with some of the premade decks because they are stuffed with 5+ CMC cards and have very few lands. You don't get to inspect a deck before playing in story mode, making it nearly impossible to know if to mulligan or not unless you played that particular match several times before (and you're likely to have to because of these stated reasons). In deckbuilding, there's no effective sorting system, so you'll be sifting through your cards a few at a time looking for the one you want.  If you grind a ****ton I suppose it's eventually possible to get a decent deck together, but expect to lose a lot until that happens.",

Do you like having a fighting chance with your jumble of noobie cards? Ahhh man, fuc&amp; , this game is actually for Timmay the power gamer who lives in his parents basement where they buy him 180$ of cards per week.   The game has its merits. It is great for teaching someone how to play magic in single player mode. Single player and missions were a lot of fun, but sadly they were over too quickly and not replayable for any rewards.   Online was pretty fun til around lvl 10+, After that its pretty much a crapshoot.as to if you will play a new deck balanced to your collection or cards, or the same copy of a good deck with everything rare and mythic that Timmays mommy buys him every week to stomp you so he can feel like he is great at mtg.  Play Hex if you want a fun card game that allows you to build some really good decks without spending a fortune in time and cards. I have spent 50+ and still dont come close to Timmay and his moms endless spending to make the game competitive. Play this if you really love magic and you love planeswalkers so much that 100$ + a month seems reasonalbe to buid a good deck, since planewalkers trump all in this game.",
