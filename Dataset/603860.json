    "description": "Welcome to the career officer, and was promoted to Admiral! This is an unusual, dynamic Tower Defense, a lot of levels. The towers have a different shooting mode, and the enemies of a different color. You will have time to repair the tower and improve them. Beware the mini-bosses! Earn medals. Good luck!",
