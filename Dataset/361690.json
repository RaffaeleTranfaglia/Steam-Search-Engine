If you can stomach the dated graphics and complex controls then prepare yourself for the ride of your life.  Like most older games there is a steep learning curve but there are fully voiced tutorials to teach all of your starfighter's mechanics. The music perfectly sets the mood and you'll start to sweat as you realize that you've let a Tie Fighter get on your 6.  Note that you must have a joystick to play but this only serves to enhnace the immersion.  Overall I have so many fond memries of this game and it runs flawlessly on modern systems. If you alwaysd wanted to fly and X-Wing (or a large number of other Star Wars vehicles) then this is the game for you.",

The combat has been overhauled once again (in a good way), the campaign was pretty fun (and rage inducing), and yes, the multiplayer is mostly dead, but the fun training modes make up for that.  Overall, the Final Verdict (AngryJoe style) for X-Wing vs TIE Fighter is a solid 8.9/10!",
