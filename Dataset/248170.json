            "review_text": "Very unsure about this product when i first saw it. I mean there must be huge down sides to a game engine that is drag and drop, right?  Wrong, its fantastic. My heart will always lie with programming your own games, but THIS is amazing for making smaller 2d games, even prototyping ideas with rapid iteration time.  You literallty game make a whole game in an hour with this :)   Im sure it has limitations, but none i have found yet :)  //**** edit ****  I found some issues:  - The standard version (not developer) when used with the Android exporter has some limitations, mainly to do with monetization.  - To use Google Admob advertising you HAVE to have the developer version (this is not clear on the product comparison page on their website)  - You CANNOT provide ANY in app purchase functiionality without the developer version.  I have seen other people ask how to use admob only to be told they need the dev version. Its just not clear enough when buying the Standard edition that those things arent included.  The comparison between versions is ONLY available on the Developer version page. It should be on the standard page as well, because the people buying standard need to know what they are NOT getting, just as much as the people buying the developer edition need to know what they ARE getting.",

            "review_text": "It was two months ago when I decided to put a little money into this little engine. Initially, the excitement was palpable. Inside of two hours I had created my first game and started to develop the mechanics towards a full release. That is how easy it is to get started.  What comes next however is the understanding of how the engine is put together, how each function, event, flag, object; how they all have individual properties and how to apply global and local events to each respectively. This practice largely came about from trial-and-error. While there are some tutorials around there isn't a concise 'Beginner-Intermediate-Advanced' starter guide and if purchasing off steam the forums are limited due to the lack of a key (edit - you can now register on forums using steam account, thanks Denilson)  This does not detract from the enjoyment and excitement of finding out the sweet spot. The idea that the answers are spoon-fed is not how this game would be made. The formulation of an idea and implementation into the engine and then the fun of testing to trial-and-error is what makes this fun and the engine helps this along. The engine does not prohibit but intices you with new ways of solving the same problem. In turn the ability to quickly formulate new approaches is really where this engine stays strong.   I am therefore a Fusioneer. Happy to develop in this engine and invest my time and effort into what will soon hopefully become a succesful first game.  Lloyd Hawthorne  www.forgedgames.co.uk ",

I had a problem and with and hour I had a reply with a solution that worked. There are a lot of resources to get started making your game straight away. This is absolutely brilliant. If your kids want to grow up and be computer programmers than buy them this.  My only wish is that the DLC/ extra exporters like the android exporter where cheaper. The IOS exporter is dearer than the main software (I guess that apple have something to do with that though, cough! cough!).",

I highly recommed this tool if your not willing to learn a high level code or just don't have the time. Clickteam Fusion 2.5 allows for rapid development for software and games. I know the tool like the back of my hand. I've been using it for about a year now (9000+ hours). But I don't like how it's 32bit program and how the steam verison has been kinda buggy on the Data Elements (Crashing on sounds) but other than that, it's a amazing program!   In my opinon, this is a must by tool for new game developers!",

            "review_text": "I will update this review and say: this might be too basic for you if you have done some programming before. You will realise you are restricted from making a function only you want time to time. But still, it's really easy to use and learn.   (I checked out a bit of Gamemaker studio, you might wanna try that one out if you want more... 'advanced(?)' options.)      Yes, i have less than 10 hours of use at the moment of writing this. But i have been using this program's free version for a while now. Probably 8 or 9 months. And i have to say,  if you are a person who are interested in game developement but don't want to get into game programming with languages of any type,  you should download the free version on it's website and give it a try!    It might take some time to learn the basics (basically any software ever) but once you get there you can start making stuff that you think are interesting or try out and replicate some classic game mechanics yourself. Now some you may wanna go for GameMaker instead. But if you are new, i think Clickteam Fusion is more.. easier to understand and more efficient in the way of how fast you can make something.",

The real downside is this product really needs a huge huge update instead you will find yourself downloading lots of plugins with different licenses from their website to fill the gaps of the missing features. The default network object for example is extremely out dated and so you will end up needing to download another, however most only support 1 platform so you end up with a segmented project.  Update this product with the level of features it already partially has but make it support all targets equally and i will change my recommendation...",

It's easy to use and understand, and despite pouring only 1,7 hours on it have been messing around with the tools and know what I am saying (kind of).  My only complaint is the price of the DLC. I have no problem with the developer upgrade (because chances of me selling a game are very low), but I find it quite annoying how I need to pour about 300$ if I want to export my game to other platforms.  Other than that, the engine itself is great and probably easier to use when compared to GameMaker.",
