            "review_text": "I got this game for two fiddy during the last sale and was like 'am I going to play this? Probably not but I'll have more than three dollars of regret if I don't pick it up'. I started playing it one night because I just wanted to get it out of my head. I played it, I was frustrated by it, and slightly intrigued. The next day, I played it a little more and read the website to get some of the inner workings of the mechanics. The next day, I played it basically all damn day long. Now I'm hooked.  What is this game? I'm so glad you asked, incredibly pliable hypothetical reader. It's a roguelike. You take one (or later, two) actions per turn. Then everything else gets a turn. A large amount of the game is driven by luck, and permadeath, and unlocking things that will make your characters stronger forever...starting after your next death. It follows in the vein of Nethack, Dungeons of Dredmor, TOME, and ADOM. You will die. You will die a ♥♥♥♥ ton. People will describe it as a terrible game for masochists, because it makes them feel good for beating it. I'm old enough to know that any game is really just a matter of time and motivation, and whether it's hardcore roguelikes, or bullet hell shooters, there ain't nothing to it but time and dedication to a meaningless diversion. Play it because it's fun, or don't if it's not.  As I was saying, it's a roguelike. I've played other roguelikes before, but I bounced off almost all of them super hard. FTL, Binding of Isaac, and Our Darker Purpose is about my level of tolerance for roguelike(likes). But this one? For some reason I'm hooked. I've played better roguelikes before, but I haven't liked any of them better. I've now spread the Rogue's Tale virus to three other people. Two of them are hooked, one hasn't installed it yet. It's inexplicable.  Let me talk mechanics for a little bit, since my subjective rambling is doing no good. You have to be okay with dying. The game is not judging you. You are not bad for dying on the first floor. The game isn't laughing at you. Sometimes you just walk down the stairs and get killed by an orc with a pickaxe before the game even truly begins. You have to make peace with that. Restarting takes about all of 10 seconds. The longer a run goes, the more control you gain over it. If you die at level 1, it's easy to cry BS RNG, but when you hit level 20, it's almost definitely going to be your own stupidity that kills you. The first time you die to a curse at level 8, you'll cry BS RNG. The second time, it'll be because you weren't able to find a curse immunity item before the undead mage got you. The third time it'll be because you abused the line of sight around a corner, charged the mage, but he got a lucky shot off before he died. The fourth time, you'll win and manage to fast travel back to town before the curse kills you, pay a little gold and survive the ordeal.  Part of the game is learning every little nuance, every right reaction, every micro-tactic. You have to fight an air elemental? Better have a ring of elements or a shock ward amulet. Don't have those? Stay at range. You're a melee character? Switch to a 2hander and hope you kill him before the lightning stun kicks in and lets the guy pick you apart at his leisure. Don't think you're strong enough to do that? Then avoid the fight. Lure him into other enemies, and let them fight, or just push a boulder down the stairs and find a new dungeon.  A surprisingly large part of this game is knowing when to give up. When you're new, you think you're supposed to win every fight, and you can't. That's part of why everyone loves to decry the RNG so much. Poker players don't go all-in every hand, and trying to do so means you have no idea how to play poker. So it is with Rogue's Tale. You learn to recognize when fights will be too hard for you to faceroll, and you'll either try to win by using scrolls and potions, or use the environment against them, or you'll avoid the fight entirely. Or you'll roll the dice and hope you come out a winner. That usually gets you killed though. There are three situations in Rogue's Tale where you'll die: when you're starting the game and still vulnerable to RNG, when you misjudge the difficulty of a fight and you don't realize your mistake in time, and finally, when you just do something incredibly stupid. I shot a boss with a wand of crippling before, hoping to wreck him with complete impunity. Little did I know his amulet reflected orb spells and weapons, and that a wand of crippling counts as a weapon or orb, and that I myself was not completely immune to the worst afflictions that the wand could cause. Over the next two dozen turns, I watched helplessly as my character was paralyzed, and the boss calmly strolled up and killed me extremely slowly. At least, it would have been slowly if I had any ability to react.  Anyway, the game is great, and I'm hopelessly addicted. Don't buy the hype about the RNG, it only is really bad when you haven't invested much time into your run anyway. You'll learn cool tricks like turning enemies into rats and throwing cheese at them to tame them.",

            "review_text": "In my opinion while playing Rogue's Tale it always feels like your 'tool-box' (the amount of options you have on hand to deal with a threatening situation) is extremely limited, and by design. Compared to say, 'Dungeon Crawl: Stone Soup', one of the titans of the rogue-like genera, the majority of early-game deaths in Rogue's Tale feel entirely unavoidable and down to the whims of the RNG. The game's item identification (ID) system is clunky and idiosyncratic; for example you might have ID'd a ring and then found another one just like it, and while the game will tell you it's the same ring the shopkeepers in the 'Town' area will refuse to buy the second one because it has yet to be subjected to an ID effect. The bulk of items you pick up will ID as having no special effects, yet the shopkeepers will still refuse to buy them unless an ID has been attempted, meaning the majority of items cannot be sold for profit until you luck into a source of permanent IDing via a rare item drop.   The RNG seems extremely harsh given the fact that you often cannot escape from most bad situations; a newly reset dungeon whose first floor is several mages and archers will result in an unavoidable death, for example. I realize that harping on the RNG in a rogue-like seems counterproductive, but I think that it just doesn't stack up well when compared to other equally difficult yet more fair rogue-likes, such as the aforementioned Dungeon Crawl: Stone Soup. In DC:SS, scrolls do not require a specific skill in order to be read, meaning that it is a perfectly legitimate strategy to burn through un-ID'd scrolls in a pinch; the tactic is risky as you can cause bad effects, but it can also save you from an untimely early death. Similarly, given how much of the game is tied up in gold-use in the “Town” area, it seems weird that it's not possible to sell un-ID'd items, even if at a lower value.   Having said all that, if you are a massive rogue-like fan you might still derive some enjoyment out of Rogue's Tale. It probably won't compare very favourably to other titles in the genera, however, and if you aren't someone who has played rogue-likes before and are curious I'd recommend you give this one a pass in favour of a different title.",

            "review_text": "A poor attempt to create a roguelike game. Insensibilities abound such as loot being unsellable because they're 'unidentified' and no merchant buys unidentified loot but to 'identify' each loot item requires a price that you can't afford unless you sell some loot which you can't because they're all unidentified *grrrrrr*. And that's just one of the silly design issues that show this game to be unworthy of the roguelike title.  - skill upgrades are uninspiring - skills that have no cooldown but have to be activated each and every time - random overpowerful encounters with no escape - several level ups before just one attribute upgrade point is given - etc etc etc  0 stars out of 5 (and that's being generous)",

            "review_text": "tl;dr: An attractive, straight-forward, god-awful hard roguelike that is worth the price.  The game's pretty straight forward: You roll a character in no time, enter the randomly-generated dungeon, desperately try to find enough equipment and critical skills to survive, then you're poisoned by a spider, burnt by an imp, crushed by a falling rock, drowned, or just plain run through. There are many ways to die in this game, and you will experience them all, over and over. Pro tip: Don't put too much thought into naming your characters.  All right, well beyond that there's side-quests, a variety of skills and spells, newly-introduced crafing, and a final boss if you're so lucky, but if you buy this game really you're buying it to die over and over. It can be quite frustrating, and like a classic rogue your death can be well-deserved, or entirely unfair. Yet I found myself coming back to this game more than the more complex ToME, Dredmor, or other rogue-likes for its simplicity and purity. Each fight is a battle of life or death, each choice is agonizing, and that's all there is to it. Pure masochism, really.  The game is, basically, too hard. You'll be lucky to see half the content, but for the money Rogue's Tale is an attractive, simple, classic rogue-like.",

You definately have to give the game a little time to grow on you. It is a Rogue-like, after all. You will die, a lot. But it's so easy to just start up again and hope you'll fair better and find even more epic gear/artifacts than the last go-round!  Best $5 game I've bought in years.",

When I bought Rogue's Tale I was pretty excited - the first few playthroughs were brutally hard and I was very excited to learn how to conquer the dungeons.  Hours passed, and more hours of gameplay passed, and eventually I found that while I could learn some new tactics, ultimately I would be defeated by any random monster that landed a few lucky hits, no matter how conservatively I played. This trend continued, and continued, and no matter what items I got or strategies I used, I basically could not figure out how to get very far in this game.  My conclusion is that the game just isn't developed enough to provide adequate strategies for the player, and instead leaves most of it up to chance. It's too bad because the game had good potential, but ultimately I'd recommend staying away from this game as it needs a lot of work before it is actually 'playable'. ",

            "review_text": "Wow, an indie title that claims to be a roguelike and ACTUALLY IS. Rogue's Tale could be a fairly competent roguelike, but the balance is just awful. Random unpreventable deaths are somewhat expected in a roguelike, but they are far too common in this game. A good roguelike can get away with brutal almost unfair encounters by providing the player with a large toolbox of skills and gadgets to diffuse the situation. Rogue's Tale gets the difficulty right, but doesn't give you the tools to overcome it.  You'll fall into an unseen pit you can't get out of. You'll enter the level surrounded by 3 enemies and no escape route. You'll get 2 shotted by an archer on the other side of the screen. Your weapon will randomly break in combat. You'll step on an invisible trap that locks the doors and summons 4 orcs....etc.  The enemies appear to always scale to your level and do not respawn, so it is not possible to gain the advantage by farming easier dungeon floors.  It does get one roguelike quality quite right - in that it never ceases to surprise you with new mobs, event, objects, and dungeon tiles. 4 hours in and I'm still seeing things Ive never seen before even on the first few levels of the dungeon.  Another problem is the identify system. Every item, even plain non magic items are unidentified, and it costs 20 gold to identify. Problem is you cant sell unID'd items to pay for the cost of IDing, so it's a Catch-22 of annoying. You also cannot use unID'd potions and scrolls. Letting the player use unID'd consumable is a pretty key mechanic to the great roguelikes of the past. It gave the player a dangerous gamble to get out of a tough situation, and it allowed the player to 'self-identify' items by observing their effect after use. In Rogue's Tale unID'd consumables are basically a waste of inventory space.  Now on to some good stuff. The game has very nice sprites. They aren't the over pretentious flashy art style common in kickstarter indie games these days. Equiped items showing on your character is a nice touch. The UI is smooth and easy to navigate, and mouse control is always a welcome feature in any roguelike.  There are no starting classes in Rogue's Tale, so the start of every run is essentially identical. Why not allow playstyle choices right from the start, like every other half decent roguelike of the past?  There is a meager meta progression system called Heritages. Heritages are unlocked by completing certain achievements during a playthrough, and allow you to start the game with some weak starter items. For example a sword and buckler, or a staff. These items do not appear to change how you play the game, so I don't really see the point. The Heritages also feel completly out of reach. I have 4 hours logged, and have unlocked 1 Heritage, and came no where close to any of the others.  Finally, the game requires that you make an account and login every time you run the game. As far as I'm concerned this is a single player game, and having to login is a giant F U to the player. Even in 'offline' mode you have to login. Isn't playing the game through Steam DRM enough?  It's not awful, but it's no roguelike for the history books.   P.S. Since 'roguelike' is thrown around so liberally these days it barely has any meaning. Perhaps calling games of this genre Morialike or Bandlike would be more appropriate now?",

            "review_text": "So first of all:  If you are looking for an extremly challenging Rogue-like you will not be disappointed with this game. Most of the negative reviews you see here are stating that this game is too luck based and you can do nothing about it. I have to say that i think this game is very luck based indeed BUT there is also lots of strategy and skill involved Those people who try to tell you that you can't do anything against dying did probably not put enough playtime into this game to understand how to survive. This game has a steep learing curve and you will see that if you continue to play it you will get better and better.  So as you could maybe already tell it is a turn based RPG with randomly generated dungeons. The loot, monsters, traps... are different every time you play and the game itself is very fast paced. The main objective of this game is to unlock heritages (some sort of achievments) to permanently get benefits for every subsequent run of this game. So it is completly normal to die as a beginner without even completing the first dungeon. But if you let's say reach level 7 for the first time for example you will get a potion of antidot on every run you attempt after the current one. So do you remember those mushrooms that can poison you when you are trying to harvest them? Great! Now you can take the risk thanks to the potion and if you can reach level 20 without eating anything else than mushrooms you will not get anymore debuffs for eating them so you will have much less trouble with food.  And thats basically the point of the game. You unlock benefits that help you unlocking even more benefits and you will get stronger and stronger by every time you play.   This game is great even if so many people tell you that it is too luck based i for myself can say it is not  You have my recommendation for this game so buy it!",
