I felt playing Dead Space when i started to play Solarix first. But then i realise. It was deeper than DS. And lastly, it doesn't look like an indie game. Just play it, you won't regret it.  Edit: Now with the version 1.1 many bugs fixed! Thanx the devs!",

            "review_text": "I usually don't write reviews of games but here it is. Right, first lets get this out of the way... this game cannot compare to system shock, deus ex etc. I really like cyberpunk, horror and stealth games so I decided to give it a go and I wasn't left disappointed. You need to overlook a few things in this game maybe even a lot such as getting stuck a lot, enemies become alert for litearlly no reason sometimes, it's extremely hard to knockout someone because you have to be standing up to do it and do it from behind (as with pretty much every other stealth game) however if you stand up and take even a single step the enemy will become alert, turn around and kick your butt. Also it doesn't really give that much information about what to do and where to go (I personally prefer it this way, I feel like games nowadays make it too easy for the player) which maybe a problem for some of the more impatient gamers. As other people have said, you WILL crouch throgh most of this game.  Well those are the bad things about this game (ones I can remember at the moment). So why give it a positive review you may ask? I don't know whether it was intended but I found the game more creepy than scary although it was a bit scary on maybe 2-3 occasions, that being said I really enjoyed the creepiness. I really enjoyed the story it kept me playing the game and wanting to get to the end, to understand what is going on, see what's caused it, how it ends etc. As I mentioned before I love stealth games and although the stealth may have been quite broken every once in a while, getting through the game without using your weapons or using them very rearely was fun and quite challenging at times.  Overall I think the game is worth a playthrough, it's not 'amazing' or 'mind-blowingly good' but it will keep you entertained for the few hours that you play it and if you get bored or angry at some of its faults, the story will keep you going.",

            "review_text": "Solarix is a mix of Horror &amp; Sci-fi, the chemistry between both blend to create an inspired piece of survival horror that is filled with atmospheric lighting &amp; sound. The background score compliments its tone, walking (crouching) down corridor's and out in the open are always scary and tense.   The AI sometimes pretend that they don't see you, just a minor bug. The frame rate stutters a tad, but nothing game breaking.  The voice acting is great, they sound brilliant - as though they were born for the part. Immersive writing really makes you believe the world that you're in, the believability in their portrayal adds to the sense of dread and terror.  The graphics look great, lighting is key in a game like this and the guys at Pulsetense Games nailed the look.",

            "review_text": "Here is my attempt at rating/reviewing “Solarix”:  Right from the start you can tell that this game was made with the influences of such games like System Shock, Doom, and Thief. However, it manages to step out of the shadows and grant a fresh experience into a genre that has thus been lost since the early 2000’s.   Is it the best game I have played? No. It is worth the asking price? Yes. Why? Because it might not be an AAA title, it does show merit and passion that has been missing from games. Yes the game has bugs, and yes the developers “have” and “are” working on numerous patches to fix these problems. Even with the remaining technical bugs, the game is fun, enjoyable, and just down-right frightening.   Review breakdown:   +Story +Soundtrack/Audio +Environmental Art +Gameplay Mechanics  -Replayabilty -Graphics are a bit outdated compared to newer game (but to be fair it was build using UDK) -Difficulty can ramp to being super hard at times  Overall this is a great game and everyone should support the team behind Solarix. If you’re not sold just yet, wait it out and I’m sure the devs will patch everything out.  ",

Atmosphere is aweasome, graphics are good enough for an indie, control and gameplay is smooth and well done optimization.  This is a stealth - sci-fi - horror game. and you get what it is. Usually AI is smart enough maybe a little tweaking needed. They are firing non-stop untill kill you when they see (or hear) you. This is stealth game if you play in shadows so there will be no problem with AI. Don't forget 'You are an engineer, not soldier!'",

            "review_text": "This game is incredibly frustrating, particularly in that it uses Unreal, a pretty much bullet proof engine; one that most of us cut our gaming teeth on. Can't tell you how many times I've gotten into a location (behind boxes, up on rocks, behind a light -- POST THE NEW PATCH -- and get completely stuck. Can't move out, can't jump out. On top of that, the game has turned off Unreal's save feature for a checkpoint system that occurs TOO RARELY. So, you get into one of these stuck positions -- the developer's fault -- and are then forced to go back to the same postition over and over. This game has got to get better than this to live up to its graphical promise.",

            "review_text": "Solarix isn't bad for a crouching sim.   Nah, just kidding. It's actually pretty bad. This has got to be one of the all-time glitchiest, bugged out, and wonky games I have ever played. The developer and publisher must have spent like zero dollars on their QA testing Oompah Loompahs for this one and it really shows. You can literally crouch your way through walls and obstacles to areas on the map that you should never be able to access or see. For example in one of the beginning outdoor areas I was able to crouch walk through a wall to see the end of the map. And that was at the beginning of the map. I encountered numerous glitches with attempting to pick up items and move them. The best glitches are the ones where you can't pick up the item and move it even though you are supposed to. Really love those. Frequently you'll get jammed or completely stuck on the edge of a pathway or obstacle. The only way to get free is to restart the level. Very annoying. Super extra special bonus glitch- I shut off the background music in the main menu and when I play the game I have background music. That's glorious.  The game describes itself as a stealth combat shooter, with a bit of choice as to how you want to tackle it. I went into it expecting something along the lines of Hitman, and boy was I wrong. There isn't much of an option other than stealth as you rarely come across any ammunition for a weapon. Instead you get to use a goofy lookin zapper that will one-shot space suit nitwits from the back of their noggin. If you are into that sort of game play style then this one is definitely for you. I found it tedious and kinda boring quickly. Oh yeah and when that one-shot to the back of the head goes wrong- and it will a good portion of the time it will also become very frustrating. Once the bad guys are alerted to your presence from a botched attack you'll be blugeoned to death like a baby seal faster than you can say baby seal.  On the positive side Solarix does have a lot of atmosphere. It's got an interesting story line and decent voice acting. The graphics are not bad, even if some folks consider them dated.  Final verdict- if you are looking for a science fiction horror game that's slow paced and you prefer to crouch sneak around the majority of the time get this on a deep discount only. Be prepared to deal with a ton of bugs as you push through each area and get yourself killed up a bunch by spacemen polluted with interstellar Ebola. Otherwise I'd skip this entirely. For reals.",
