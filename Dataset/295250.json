            "review_text": "I've tried playing this game quite some times. Each time, however, the only thing this game left me with, was one wish: the wish somebody would turn this piece of software into a real *GAME*, into a point &amp; click adventure. I absolutely ADORE the gorgeous pixel art, the animation and the atmosphere. It reminds me of some mystical places you could visit on Mars in 'Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders' or on the planet Cocytus in 'The Dig'.  However, this is NOT a point &amp; click adventure in the classical sense, even though it might look the part!  It is merely a game in which you go from one screen to the next – and not in a fluid motion either; the protagonist can stand in up to 6 places in each screen and you really have to wait a lot until he/she actually moves – and try to interact with something. I write 'try to interact' because it really is that! Most of the time, your clicking doesn't achieve anything. There are so many interesting objects and characters(?) on screen but there's just nothing you can do with them.  All in all, more than anything else, Stranded feels like some sort of experiment.  Which is a shame. This could have been SO MUCH MORE! At the current price tag, it's something you *can* buy just for the beautiful art. Better yet, however: wait for it to be discounted and try it then!",

However, for $2 it was a satisfying piece of art, if not all that good as a game. The unnecessary amount of clicking just to move around was annoying, and it's not interactive in any meaningful sense. But the music is entrancing and the graphics are nice to look at.",

It's a pretentiously overpriced waste of time made by a *designer* with no understanding of what good writing and direction happen to be. I wager that if this interactive experience came with dialog it would be quality on par with badly written 80's paperback smut.",

            "review_text": "What a rip-off. I get that it is supposed to be aesthethic. For a game that supposedly focuses on exploration there isn't much exploring to do. You start in a space ship, explore maybe 15 different screens (Most of them being duplicates with different colors) with NOTHING to click at all. You just walk from screen to screen. There is no discernable story at all, not one that makes sense at least.   Not to mention the game is only 15-30minutes long. And it has NO replay value.  I am generally a fan of small Indie Sci-Fi games and i absolutely adore point and click adventures, games like Machinarium, Deponia and Resonance are just some of the good ones. All great games and all of them bring unique twists to the Point and Click genre.   Stranded however seems in my oppinion to try to hard to be something it is not. They say 'It is both a love letter to classic point &amp; click adventures, and an experiment with the fundamentals of the genre.' Sure i can believe it is a love letter, but i wouldn't call it an experiement with the genre. It is just a Point and Click stripped of everything that makes a Point and Click so good.   It's basically a point and click railroad experience where you in 20-30 minutes of boredom, are forced to repeat the exact same steps 3 times over and over with a character that walks SO slowly that you will mummify before the game is over.  So if you came here looking for a Sci-Fi experience, Point and Click or an Exploration game, even just a good game. Don't bother even touching it, you WILL be dissapointed to the point of just wishing you could get your money back.  If you absolutely want to spend $7 on something, you are better of going to your local supermarked and buying yourself the softest most expensive toilet paper available, at least that will give you some comfort and joy, and it will last longer than this game as well.",

            "review_text": "While obviously not for everyone, Stranded is a unique audio/visual experience that is extremely pleasing to the eyes and ears. The setting is incredibly mysterious, and you're thrown into an unknown world with little to no explanations. As you leave your marooned ship you'll slowly discover the secrets of your surrounding, and watch them change as the days and nights pass by. This feels more akin to an art project than a video game, and I love it.  The game itself is very slow paced, which feels necessary for the story being told and the tense atmosphere being created as you travel further away from your base. This deliberate pacing only serves the creeping feeling of lostness and wonder, allowing you to take in your surroundings and focus on the sound of every breath you take.   The soundtrack is a masterpiece and serves as much more than your standard background music as it evolves with every action you take, building up and changing as you visit different temples or advance between night and day. The dynamic soundtrack reminded me of Proteus, and is my favorite aspect of these games.  In the end Stranded is a short but sweet experience that most people looking for a 'gaming' session will be disappointed with, but those of you with a serious appreciation for lovingly detailed art, sound design, and storytelling will find a very memorable experience that is more than your money's worth.",

There is no scene interaction, no inventoy, etc. The walking paths are pre-scripted and painfully slow. The scenery is recycled, and the cave never makes it clear there are branching paths within it.  This story is only about 15 minutes long and the 8 dollar price tag is just not worth the amount of gameplay it provides. Especially when you will spend 90% of your time doing nothing but slowly walking.",

But it also manages to build a beautiful atmosphere of mystery and quiet wonder that's really quite rare. People complain that it's short, but I think the length works in the games favour - it's a short, lovely look at an beautiful alien world, and anything longer would have lost those element of mystery and wonder that the game captures so well. The walking animation is a little too slow, or else the distances you walk across are a little too large, and since you'll be walking back and forth a lot it does get a little frustrating at times (especially with the slight wonkiness of how the game moves your character in response to a mouse-click). But mostly it was very charming, and just as long as it needed to be.",

            "review_text": "Stranded is less a game than it is a short visual novel, and less a visual novel than it is a neat spacey soundtrack with a godawful clicking experience attached. The game's premise is simple: you are an anonymous astronaut whose ship has crash-landed on an inhospitable planet, and you must find some means of salvation before your life support runs out. Gameplay is also simple; click on a part of the screen to slowly walk there, and click on the edge of the screen to slowly move to the next area. As you explore, events will unfold, and eventually an ending will smack you in the face.  Stranded makes the peculiar mistake of homaging old school point-and-click adventure games by removing everything fun from them (goofy humor, engaging puzzles, clever writing), and leaving only the prehistoric limitations of the SCUMM engine. The whole experience won't take you more than an hour to complete, and the majority of that time will be spent watching your silent spaceperson march across the same tiny patches of landscape again and again. I can't say for certain that there aren't some secrets hidden here that I haven't discovered, but the experience was drawn out enough to kill any interest in doing so. The ending is a neat little twist, admittedly, and the soundtrack is rather excellent, but beyond that Stranded is a fairly miserable experience.",

I would love to have seen an exploration game that uses a timed life to encourage exploration: ‘take-in-what-you-can-before-it’s-over’ may have been a great incentive.   It’s hard to find the right response to Stranded because it barely spoke to me. There might be a story here, but Stranded ensures it remain unheard.",
