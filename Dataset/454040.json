When the crashing problem gets fixed this is going to be a very enjoyable game.  9 out of 10 providing the crashing problem gets fixed.   P.S  The crashes seem to happen when trying to load to the seconed level of the game (after the basic tutorial) this may be cause an optimization issue or the level transition its self the crashes may also be caused by scrip errors being created by the A.I or the A.I its self. I hope you found this information helpful.",

I really wanted to like it so I tried many times and more.  PROs: Interesting Idea. The dev had a nice concept that feels like a movie. Soundtrack  CONs: The game crash at every loading screens. You really need to run it like 5 times on each loading screens to overcome the crash. The graphics are horrible. (A game using the FPS Creator engine.) Only 5 levels and VERY VERY VERY easy to finish. Very small levels. The game ain't fully translated AND MANY BUGS   I finished the game about 24 minutes and thats counting the fact that I had to relaunch it about 60 times to finish it.  (Note to the creator: FORGET ABOUT FPS CREATOR!) p.s: I noticed some little things that might not be allowed to be used in this game. Like Markiplier's face on a newspaper.  DON'T BUY It's too short, too ugly, too buggy to even worth $0.01.
