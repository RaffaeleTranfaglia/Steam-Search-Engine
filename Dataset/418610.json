The first check poin brings you to a place where we have to jump on the green floor twice and go foward in the stage but right there, there is a big spike ball that is spinning which i cannot go through. I cannot jump over it but i cant go under it either. Please help me. Idk what to do",

If strongly slowly do all the boring. If quickly, bored to die. In this game, the difficulties with preparing the first level. But in the above games, you can easily pass At least 5 first.  Not only weighs Not only is worth Trading cards A lot of anger and rage  Nice try, but I do not break new keyboard!",

Next 5 minutes: I think to myself, why did I only play this game for five minutes, I jump around, dying repeatedly. I reach the first checkpoint, I continue to die repeatedly, I throw my laptop at a wall.  10/10 Would rage at again.",

I recently reviewed 'There Was A Caveman' calling it yet another mediocre hardcore platformer but this game only wishes it could be like that game or any of the tens or maybe hundreds of mediocre platformer games.  Floaty controls, 'minimalistic' graphics, dull music, no sound effects and on top of that much too hard, mostly due to the controls. Why would I buy and play this when much better free alternatives are available? Even much of what is produced in Ludum Dare and such contests during a weekend is far superior to this drivel.  Got this in a bundle with other games from the same developer for super cheap. Mostly bought the bundle because the games promised Linux support, but they just wouldn't work on my netbook. After trying some of them on a desktop PC I honestly feel ripped of even though the bundle was only $1.69 or something like that...",
