            "review_text": " THE DOWNLOW:  Transmissions: Element 120 is a Source engine developed indie game set in the Half-Life universe. It consists of four well-made if somewhat short chapters that provide a few encounters with your favourite crab-zombies and combine soldiers. The overall feel and setting is designed to be a mixture of horror and puzzle solving, with a little hint of combat at key moments.   THE GOOD:  + More Half-Life style play. + Great care and attention to create an immersive environment and detailed locations, take this small team's effort a step up. + The custom made soundtrack elevates the tension and key encounters to another level. + Loved the clever use of luminescent paint in certain areas. + Its short and can be played in two to three hours. + Achievements are simple to obtain but can be missed if not careful. + Its free.   THE BAD:  - Not much really. If anything there could have been a little more spoken narrative / dialogue included to help build up a better picture of the scenario. - Some of the AI routines stop working for combine soldiers and they just stand there doing nothing. Happened a few times. - Progressing through some of the physics-based doorways/exits can be confusing. So if thats not your thing make sure you are happy to consult a guide.   AND THE ORDINARY:  * The engine may be dated but the developers have maxxed out as much as possible with the tools they have to make this more than just a mod. * There isnt much combat with it being staged in key set-pieces towards the end of chapters.    VERDICT:  Short, well-made but enjoyable nonetheless. If you are waiting for Half-life (Episode) 3 you could do worse than check this out! Its one of the best free-to-play efforts that you are bound to find on steam. Fans of Half-life should enjoy this no question. Otherwise if you are after easy/quick achievements or just like to pass the time with free games then you would be a fool not to try this. If however you are after a pure or heavy-focused shooter then this is not for you.",

If you want something with good atmosphere then I recommend this.  The story is short, but solid. You wake up in a train cart, and from there you proceed to find the remains of what seems to be a Rebel outpost. The further you go into it all the less you will understand, until you find a note left behind by what you can only assume is a dead rebel. From there you continue on and end up in a lab. There you find what looks like a Gravity Gun but it is very different. There you will also find a note explaining that they had been experimenting with what seemed to be named Element 120.  I will not list a pros and cons because I can only think of one thing that would be a con, and that's how short the mod is.  It does a great job to create an excellent atmosphere and fun gameplay. The level design is amazing too.  8/10 - Just wish it was longer.",

            "review_text": "I'm always looking for more Half Life 2. It's one of the very first PC games I played and it has been in a special place in my heart ever since. Valve was a pioneer in the first person shooter genre in both puzzling and shooting baddies. Transmissions expands on the design and fun of Half Life 2, if only briefly, in ways I never thought could be done. For example, right off at the start of the game, you wake on a train, much like the rest. In total darkness, you are unsure what to do until the game cracks the door and light spills in to show you what to do. There were no tooltips, the set was designed to show you what to do. These sets are also stunning in the graphics themselves. The textures are a lot more high res, the lights have bloom, and other post processing effects make it more immersive than Source games before it.   After you leave the opening sequence, you amass an arsenal in true Half Life fashion. But you also get introduced to game mechanics unique to Transmissions. 'The breathless can't see in the dark'. With glow in the dark paint and QR codes that can be decoded by zooming in left by an unknown helper, you discover that the absence of light switches the AI of the zombies and turrets off. It's more of a puzzle element than a stealth element, but being able to switch out the lights to sneak around is an interesting puzzle to add to the game. The last bit of gameplay is another repurposed Gravity Gun. In this game, it's a dedicated rocket jump. It's very simple and fun to use.  The only downside to this amazing game is the length. I finished it in a half hour, and while you can replay it for the rest of the achievements, I was left hungry for more. If the developer is reading this, make more. I will pay for it.",

            "review_text": "  Game   : Transmissions: Element 120   Score   : 8/10    TL:DR   : A great little experience if you're a fan of the Half-life series, although the brief length of the game hinders the full potential of all the elements and new ideas the game brings to the table.    Summary   : Let me first say, the game certainly was a great addition to the source engine's vast library of success. It utilized all of its assets and created an experience that was well worth enjoying. Power to the developer for making such an interesting little mod for a near-forgotten universe. Although, I'd like to give (hopefully) constructive criticisms where I see them fit.    Lack of Continuity   - What I mean when I say this is, you are presented on multiple occasions with an interesting new mechanic that aids in solving a couple of puzzles, though thereafter it's merely tossed to the wind. A primary example of this is manuevering in the dark amidst zombies. There was so much potential for further utilizing this type of puzzle, though after only a one time use it was never used again at any point in the game.    In fact, thereafter players were instead greeted with an onslaught of zombies. While still a fun encounter, it only further fuels my point.    The gravity gun in many respects also falls under this critique, as it had the potential for so much more, yet met its peak of use mere moments after having acquired it.    Little Story Development   - Aside from recognizing that you are in a city infested with zombies and that there are combine soldiers patrolling the streets, there isn't much to tell. While there are notes that further elaborate on the situation, they too left me wondering 'What happens next?'. It's good to have ambiguity in stories such as these, though without any form of revelation, I feel as if the premise falls flat.  But, aside from my opinions, the game itself is certainly a more than enjoyable experience if you're looking to kill an hour or two. So, with that said, I would definitely recommend picking this little diddy up!",

While not much is explained during the story it is clear that we join the rebels and support them in their fight against the Combine. Journals and QR codes scattered across the 4 chapters shed some light on the story.  The new addition to this game is the unique gravity gun we are provided with. Instead of being able to pull objects from a distance the gravity gun now launches an energy orb - similar to the secondary fire mode of the Pulse Rifle - that destroys everything in its path. It uses our auxiliary power so whilst it is practically a weapon with infinite ammo we have to wait until it charges.   Not only that but shooting underneath us propels our hero up the air. Call it Half Life's version of Quake's good-old rocketjump! This allows us to reach higher spots and helps us with maneuvering against the striders in the endgame.  The only downside with Transmissions is that it's terribly short. It could have used a couple of more levels with the inclusion of other enemies from the franchise such as more Combine soldiers or some Hunters. In any case, this is a must for Half Life fans!",

            "review_text": "A fun little mod for sure, and at just a single hour's length it isn't a big time investment at all to try out, with an atmospheric first half and a bombastic combat-focused second half with a unique modified weapon. I suffered one crash during my playthrough, but luckily the autosaves are frequent. The mod includes achievements, so while it is short, there are a few challenges to increase replay value for those who want to play it a second or third time. I would say just go play it and judge for yourself due to it's short length - as such the remainder of the review contains some gameplay spoilers:  The unique element of the mod is a gravity gun that fires exploding energy balls, and can be used to rocket jump by firing below you as you jump. It was a fun mechanic, but it felt a bit underused. There are just a couple of arbitrary moments where you are forced to use it to reach a high ledge, but in combat it is seemingly optional, since the game kits you out with pretty much the entire gallery of weapons from Half-Life 2. Ammo is a little scarce, but not entirely, making the game feel like it sends mixed messages a little. On the flipside it does mean you can play with either the new weapon or have a more traditional Half-Life experience, but it does mean neither option is particularly tightly designed. You also don't get the modified Gravity Gun until about halfway through the game, which was a surprising factor considering it's the mod's selling point. It feels like the guns are there as a get out of jail free card for when the gravity gun runs out of charge, but I'd rather it retained it's standard close-range jolt to stun enemies, so you can run away and recover - perhaps make it so this mechanic also allows for long jumps for retreats without causing damage to enemies.  The first chapter was nicely designed with the darkness providing some neat gimmicks. I'd be lying if I said I didn't have to really work up the courage to descend into the pit of zombies, despite being well-familiar with them from multiple Half-Life 2 playthroughs over the years. The crescendo at the end of the third chapter felt more fun and exciting to use the new Gravity Gun, with tons of toys and traps to manipulate with it to wreck hordes of zombies. Meanwhile the fourth chapter's finale encounter felt like the epitome of my 'mixed messages' criticism, where rather than being used creatively for combat, the gravity gun instead is just a means to get around and collect a finite amount of rockets to take out Striders in a very traditional manner. While two cranes can be shot to drop shipping containers on the Striders for a very satisfying payoff, once both those chances are used up, that's the end of the only creative idea the finale has.  Overall, I feel if this mod is intended to serve as a proof of concept for this gravity gun idea, it has succeeded very well, the idea has great potential. I just wish the mod was overall more focused and tightly designed around it, I'm sure some more creative things could be done and the reliance on showering the player with typical Half-Life weapons could be axed. If however, the mod is just meant to be what it is, it still succeeds at being a pleasurable experience from start to finish.",

            "review_text": " Transmissions: Element 120  is a short single-player experience, where you play as Gordon Freeman [obviously] from the original Half-Life series. You are not given any objective from the start, you don't know where you are and where to go. All of this creates an unforgettable, dark and immersive atmosphere.   The game looks beautiful, the new, redesigned source engine is just a joy to look at. The gameplay introduces a few new game mechanics, such as zombies can't see in the dark, so you have to keep your flashligh off while avoiding zombies in a pitch black darkness. Also, you are given a new weapon - a reconstructed gravity gun [Element 120], which shoots out energy orbs, killing instantly everything that's in its way. I don't have to tell you, that it is incredibly fun to play with.  Since the game is not very long, there aren't many action scenes. There are only two big action sequences, both of them at the very end. But when you experience them, you will want more! They are perfectly choreographed, with adrenalin-pumping music and lots of ways to dispatch your enemies. It's evident that a lot of care went into designing these scenes, but it's a shame that the best parts are only at the end.  The only criticism I have is the lack of guidance. There are a few rooms you will get stuck at, trying to figure out what are you supposed to do and where to go. There are moments when you have to use your new gravity gun to blast open barricaded doors or just jump through something, however, they aren't indicated very well, often just blending in with background.   PROS'n'CONS:  + fast and enjoyable gameplay + immersive atmosphere [play this at night with lights off!] + fun action sequences + music + sound design + free to play  - too short [one hour to complete the story + 20 minutes to get achievements] - lack of guidance/tutorial   OVERALL:  It is a nice, albeit short, one hour experience, but incredibly fun. And hey,  it's F2P  so why not give it a go? ",

Guns become pointless as the jump gun one shots both zombies and combine whilst having an area of effect damage.  The final battle is very well done as striders use their cannon to shoot holes through all of the buildings and crouch to shoot you through the holes, my only two complaints are that striders cant shoot you on most of the roofs and that it gets tedious when you have to constantly jump around the map searching for rocket launcher ammo (which always comes with health) instead of having the ability to use creative means to kill the striders, other than two shipping containers which have a ridiculous delay on dropping and the fact that the game just adds more striders in the same number at the same time with a few combines adds no tension or desperation when the game doesnt try to add another type of danger which could possibly counter your jump gun, such as a chopper or the striders destroying structures completely.",

A shout out in particular to the design of the environments, which is suitably dark and gritty just as City17 and Ravenholm were at their very best moments (plus some wonderfully moody lighting in places) and the new 'gravity cannon' which is especially satisfying to use.  The main detractors would be the short completion time and the lack of any real plot or purpose - a vague backstory is alluded to, but never really built on or made the most of. It's also not going to win many awards for originality (besides the new weapon) as it's the standard trawl through familiar crumbling urban environments battling Combine and zombies. It's a free mod though, so there's little reason not to pick up and play and lose an enjoyable couple of hours to Half Life once again.",

This game is certainly one to be called 'Short but sweet', Transmissions:Element 120 is a known, a HL2 modification that takes place in an unknown city, the player has to traverse the incredibly 'Alive' levels and under alive i mean, levels that will make one truly believe that someone lived, fought, died there, doing something. The game also adds a new weapon, i won't spoil it, but its awesome, adds a very interesting piece of AI to zombies (ONe that blew my mind), the music is fitting in every place, addind to the perfectly crafted and detailed atmosphere. So, what are its good sides. - High details, every scene tellig its sad story - Ai, tweaks to balance or add realism - New additions to the scenedry like bar codes, new graffities etc. - Interesting puzzles that do not require one to wrek his mind to solve. - A lot of breakable props, openable doors and so on  And its bad sides are...Typical half life Shinanigans that came from the release of it...and eye-hurtingly dark, i'm writing this the moment i finished playing the last level, it is incredibly dark.  TE120 is an incredibly atmospheric game, one must have a lot of curiosity and test out their ideas to find hidden items, loot, etc. Look for drawings and bar codes az they help out a lot. So don't be shy to test out your theories about somehting. This can't be considered a horror game, but its no less good. If you look for said category, turn back, but if you want to immerse yourslef into the dead city, filled by echoes of the past and bodies of ones who wanted freeom...This is a game for you  Developer, thank you for making me spend these 1.4 hours of my life and be incredibly satisfyied with it.

In fact, right as you get the crowbar, a scanner appears and you can destroy it if you want to. Later on you get an interesting weapon that acts similar to a rocket launcher in the fact that it shoots a powerful projectile that explodes on contact with anything, and allows you to blast jump (kinda), but the main upside of it is: it does not hurt you at all (excluding fall damage), and technically has infinite ammo. Downside is: it takes auxilary power, which is what you need to sprint to escape from any dangers you cannot handle, and the amount used per shot is about 20-25%, meaning you only have about 5 shots before you cannot use it. Thankfully auxilary power regenerates somewhat quickly. At the end of the whole thing, you have a decently large battle against some combine troops, including some of the more powerful ones which can only be killed with rocket launchers. To aid in this battle, the rooftops and the shed have rocket ammo on(in) them, which can be picked up at any time.

It had a nice 'portal' mentality as the user figures out how to use Element 120. It's about as long to play as Half Life: Lost Coast - I would need to sit down and time them to be sure of the difference. But very enjoyable and a nice challenge. I would recommend without question. Even if it were sold (for, say $5-8) I would be willing to purchase it.  Well done, Creator. Well done.",

The biggest one is that you can “rocket” jump with the gravity gun – pretty cool. The graphics are good; I liked the outdoor sections very much. The achievements are easy to get but if you are not prepared you’ll probably need to beat the game twice (which is not bad at all).  It is a real treat that we can have this for free. ",

Transmissions: Element 120  is great for fans of the  Half-Life  series who are looking for more content. Easily recommended - no complaints here.",
