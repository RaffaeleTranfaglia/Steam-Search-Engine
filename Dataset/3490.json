            "review_text": "Venice is a puzzle game from casual game company PopCap. While the company is very familiar to many people, this game is not. It's a hidden gem on the PC platform, and it has a harsh difficulty curve.  The game centers around Venice, Italy sinking into the waves, and it's up to you, as a random small-ish gondola, to save the treasures of Venice before all is lost. It's a better story than Bejeweled, but not exactly AAA writing. But, for what it needs to do, it sets the game up perfectly.  If you've ever played Luxor or Zuma, the game controls essentially like that. Your objective is to match all of the shapes without letting any fall into the water below. This is where the game can and will screw you over multiple times, by placing nearly impossible trick shots that rely on pin-point timing and accuracy. It can get frustrating, but you feel a good sense of accomplishment after completing the level.  The music is up to PopCap standards, as it fits the gameplay very well, and adds to the atmosphere. The visuals do the job, but show their age. Not too much to the point of looking bad, but enough to notice. I have a reoccuring problem with many of PopCap's games. It doesn't detect that my graphics card supports hardware acceleration, even though it does. I'm sporting an AMD Radeon HD 8240, and my old iBook G4 from 2005 supports hardware acceleration. I don't get it, but the game looks nice even without accelerated graphics.  Overall, I give this game my Seal of Reccomendation. Pick it up if you want an obscure classic. I'm not responsible for any hardware-related damage you may inflict upon your system.",
