            "review_text": "I couldn't play this due to the menu bug yesterday, they fixed this.  The game automaticaly detects xbox360 controller, which was cool, but it didn't work in the menu. So you have to click the menu buttons with your mouse and then switch to your controller which is bothersome and bad UI design. My mouse cursor disappears in the main menu also.  The screen was too small, and by that I don't mean the resolution. The logo's got cut-off on my screen at the left and right side. Besides that, there is very little room to manouver your ship. You can't even defeat a basic enemy when using your non-upgraded gun and staying still. The enemy will shoot either twice or once and you can't stay in the line of fire. So you have to rely on upgrades in order to actually kill anything.  The upgrade-system is funny. There are two kinds of upgrades: weapon and 'movement'. The first one upgrades your weapon to either triple, double-triple or double shot. The second either slows or speeds you up, fixes your position horizontally or vertically (all with matching sound effects) or gives you double damage. This causes the game to feel random and unpredictable, which can be fun but I thought it was irritating since you can't rely on upgrades to help you.  It felt to me like I got more of the negative upgrades than the positive ones.  The graphics are ok for a Unity game.  I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone unless they balance it more. It feels like a pretty Flash game.",

            "review_text": "This is a terrible game.  The game itself is a horrible mish-mash. Even simple things like the sound and music sliders are done poorly (this is in unity, and they are clearly not getting the slider value from the saved preferences when they load the scene). I couldn't figure out whether 'Star Game' is a typo or just a really bad name for playing.  The power-ups, such as they are, are mostly random, and all last for just a short period of time. This is a good thing, because power-ups can be negative as well as positive, like slowing down your ship for 30 seconds, or making you unable to fire for 30 seconds.  The objects on the screen are huge compared to the play area, which means that it is really easy to hit and to be hit. Also, enemy shots often appear to have faint particle trails attached to them, without any actual image for the projectile. This means you can't see many of the enemy bullets that are coming at you. That is devastating for a bullet hell type game.  Also, the art is all over the place in terms of quality. Either they have an artist that is really not very good, or they bought assets from a variety of places, and then just threw them all together without thinking if it made for a visually coherent experience. Speaking of visual incoherence, your ship is set up in a side scrolling mode, but the particles in the background come straight at you as if they were purchased for a flight simulator.   All in all the whole thing just does not work. The game is needlessly difficult due to randomly bad powerups and invisible bullets. The art is a mess. The options don't work right. They didn't even put an intro graphic in the unity launch screen.  I assume this is someone's first attempt at a game. Don't waste your money on it.  1/10",

            "review_text": "EDIT  I recently reformatted my laptop to install linux. Upon searching for the chromium browser, I accidently installed something called Chromium B.S.U. Chromium BSU is a shooter space game that looks almost exactly like Stellar 2D and has been around for much longer. Ships, power-ups, everything practically the same.   It takes a lot of guts to rip someone off like this. You make me sick. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  This game really seems to have a lot of potential and it floors me to think that the dev released something so...incomplete. I don't want to say it's 'terrible,' but honestly, in its current state, Stellar 2D is a steaming pile of crap.  Cons: +Volume controls don't work- this is important because the shooty sounds are pretty annoying while the music is fitting and nice +Font is absolutely dreadful (this may be the graphic designer in me, though) +Enemy spawn is hugely unbalanced. After a certain point, the game becomes impossible and left me feeling extremely frustrated.  Pros: +I want to commend the dev on how quickly the menu bug was fixed! Awesome! I hope fixes like this will come often. +Music is nice and makes me feel like I'm in an arcade space battle +Cool ships +I want to keep playing! But at this point, I probably won't because of how unbalanced this game is.  With more effort and a lot of love, I bet this lil' baby can be turned into something successful and great.  Due to its current state, however, I cannot reccomend Stellar 2D.",

It is not worth a dollar, it is not even worth a sale price. This should not be 'sold' at all, but given away freely only to the designer's closest friends who will then probably never play any other games he makes again.  As far as arcade shooters go, the controls are clunky, the graphics are not coherent with eachother (and other than the spaceships are very ugly), and the powerups? are confusing. Most of what you encounter with your ship is a randomized effect (almost always negative) with little or no explanation. When you do get a weapon upgrade it barely lasts any length of time. The enemies are huge on the screen as is their fire, your ship is also too big for the screen size making it very difficult to dodge anything.   I played this for a very short period of time and found no enjoyment what-so-ever. I do not recommend this title on any level.",

            "review_text": "As much as I like 2-D shoot ‘em ups, there isn’t much good I can say about Stellar 2D.  This game has potential to become a decent 2-D shooter, except the gameplay constantly works against you while playing the game. The ship is fairly hard to control in contrast to most 2-D shooters out there. Pressing up and left while shooting will cause the ship to ignore your input, making it harder to maneuver around enemy projectiles. Some of the bullets are difficult to see, particularly the linear bullets that are mildly faded. It’s not too big of problem, but I’ve died so many times not knowing what just hit my ship until the last second. The biggest problem I have with the enemy bullets is the sound it makes when the enemy ship fires one. The default audio level of the sound effect greatly contrasts the default audio level of the background music and you will constantly hear the same few sound effects every second. The red, blue, and green sphere thingy (Note: I don’t know its official name) is the most annoying mechanic in the game for me. Basically, its risk versus reward. You can either get a speed boost, power boost, or one of the major debuffs the game has to offer. These debuffs occur way more than it should and it destroys any chance you have at surviving. These debuffs include: no horizontal movement, no vertical movement, having your ship slow down, and worst of all, the inability to shoot. The inability to shoot not only allows you to become more susceptible to damage, it also hinders your progress towards making it to the next level. Finally, the bosses are a joke. No really, they only exist to randomly show up and die in less than three seconds.  As much as the bad stuff outweighs the good with this game, some of the good ideas this game has seems faintly innovative. I like the leniency of this game. The amount of HP it gives, the shield mechanic, and the rate the health packs spawns lends the game to a more casual audience. The amount of health the enemies have, make the gameplay fast-paced and mildly amusing compared to the average shoot ‘em up. The range upgrades makes the game somewhat enjoyable for me. Having an edge over your enemies when using this upgrade is satisfying to say the least. If I could say anything bad about it, it’s that you’re not able to pick up a better range upgrade until your current one runs out. That and the fact you can only keep it for a limited amount of time.  Overall, the game felt unsatisfying. With a decent idea, bad gameplay, and that unskippable logo sequence, I would recommend getting it only for the trading cards. ",

            "review_text": "The developer probably put a lot of what he felt was effort into the game. However, the game fails in many levels.   THE BAD: 1. When you 'die', you skip to the next level. 2. The controls aren't very responsive. 3. The graphics are mostly very poorly made.  4. The UI is definitely not 'Stellar'. 5. The colours and font usage is very bad.  6. The voice acting... I wanted to shut the sound off. 7. The sprites on the map do not seem optimized for the game screen's viewable area. They all seem big and clumsy. 8. In Level 2, the developer used a picture of the SSV Normandy which is obviously against the law. He's stealing content and using it in a commercial product.   THE GOOD: 1. The music is passable. 2. The power-ups and random buffs and debuffs adds an interesting touch to a shooter game.  SUMMARY: Buy it if you want to risk making a few pennies off the trading cards you can get from this game, when the game is selling at 15 cents. If you have a very old computer from 2002 to 2004 era, go ahead and pick this up if you truly have nothing else to do. Also, if you want to support independent developers, even if they have very little design sense, go ahead and buy it.  Otherwise, I don't want to sound mean, but I rather lick a piece of white paper for an hour than to play this game for 10 minutes.",

            "review_text": "I only felt the need to write a review because of all the people hating on this game. Not that I'm going to come out swinging in an attempt to defend it as it definitely has issues, but it has also been out for all of four days as of this post. Four days and the dev is already admitting to making some mistakes (start menu locking up and making the game unplayable) and better yet, taking steps to fix them. How many triple-A titles are chock full of bugs at launch requiring patches for the next few weeks? Pretty much every WoW xpac comes to mind among many other titles. I'm guessing that's forgivable because it's a big name developer, right? The game is a DOLLAR at base price... I work a minimum wage job part-time and find nearly that much in loose change on the floor when I sweep at night, how is anyone complaining about anything in this game? Especially since it's on sale for thirteen cents... that's not sitting between the cushions in your couch? It's far too loud, yes. Turn your system/headphone/speaker/whatever volume down if the in-game volume controls don't work. Game.exe seems weird? Really? Should they have named it stellar2d.exe instead? Do you remember any of the older games that started up in DOS as ______.exe and sat there while command lines popped up until it had finished doing its thing and the game finally started? There's more that I'd bash on but I'll just get to the review.  ~~~~~~~  The game is quite simply a very low-end indie version of any side-scrolling shoorter you've ever played and this is visible in pretty much every aspect of the game. It seems very similar to the old shooters I played as a kid in the local arcade, R-Type for instance, though much less polished.  I can't comment on the Config window that pops up after launching the game as I set it to what I felt should be right the first time and never messed with it again and I don't play with a joystick, WASD works great.  The main menu is uncomplicated and features the usual selections though the sliders in Options are more difficult to manipulate than they should be while the font throughout the game is perhaps too stylized and the navigation arrows in some places aren't immediately obvious (the ones in the ship select screen particularly) and need some sort of contrasting border or perhaps not be neon blue. The Credits page (did anyone even bother checking that out?) points out just how much of an indie title this is, six people. That's counting the gal at the end who was responsible for the social media end of things and not credited with any sort of development. Something else I noticed, they're all the type of photos you'd see on someone's facebook page (except for David Webb's, totally lives in an 80s sitcom... ) My point is these are just a few people, probably all friends, who wanted to make something and share it with us.   As for gameplay, it's actually kinda challenging, for me at least, and it gets very frantic further in but is fun in its own way. I think the gameplay elements need to be a bit more clear, like the swirling blue cloud that starts to chase your ship around... what is it? It'd be cool if hitting a new power-up either reset the timer on your current one (assuming they're the same) or swapped to the new one. I feel that the traps, debuffs basically, are a bit too powerful or unclear. For instance the vertical/horizontal freezes and no shooting, they last far too long in my opinion. The no shooting one especially, that basically ends the game as the screen is swarmed with enemy ships long before it wears off.   There needs to be a cursor for menu navigation or have mouse movements change what items are selected as with tabbing through clickable things in a window. Just seems weird that you have to navigate with an invisible cusor.  The intro movie made me facepalm, I just... that voice, it's a good try though.  The ship designs for the most part are very interesting and I feel sensical in many cases. I'll probably use some of them as ideas for Space Engineers or my own artwork.  I love most of the backgrounds and in fact I'd have paid a dollar for a game that was simply dodging asteroids with high-res versions of the images used for the backgrounds (total space nut) though I'm not sure how I feel about images that are obviously from other games like seeing the Normandy from Mass Effect.  The music is kinda nice and if they released a twenty-five or even fifty cent DLC of the soundtrack I'd probably snag that too if the tracks were at least a few minutes long each or all mixed together to make a long-ish track that looped well.  I think the general backlash from many of the commenters could have been avoided if the game had been released as Early Access and therefore obviously a WiP and as it stands right now I think that's the only way this should even be on Steam since it is far from completed (glaring typo on the main screen for instance unless that's supposed to be Star since the game is Stellar 2D, stellar-star... har har?) But that also means that if they plan to do more with it such as general improvements maybe there will be more modes like a zen type mode with relaxing music or a super swarm mode featuring default gameplay but with a bazillion debuffs that last a fraction of a second just to mess with you...   Overall I can't sit and play for hours straight and I doubt this game will get more than a few hours of play total but for the price it's well worth it. It needs a ton of work but it's a decent attempt at producing a simple game so it gets a 3 or 4 out of 10 for execution but I'd add a point for the attempt and at the non-sale price of a buck, it gets another point or two for value so say an even 6/10. I definitely don't feel that I was ripped off, even if the developer made no more changes to the game and left it as is, it is playable and mildly entertaining. Not a bad way to kill ten or fifteen minutes before heading out the door. Recommended if for no other reason than as encouragement to an indie developer to try again.  ~~~~~~~  tl:dr ♥♥♥♥ off with the negativity about the problems in a thirteen cent game made by a small group of friends who have lives outside of game development.

The graphics are decent, although sometimes telling what is an incoming projectile and what isn't can be difficult. Sounds are subpar, and the voiceover in the opening sequence is so poorly recorded and over-modulated as to be almost unintelligible. The enemy AI is laughable; there is no variation, they all just plod along in a straight line. As other reviewers have commented, hold your fire button and that's the end of it.  Buy it for $0.13? May be worth it. $0.99? No way.",

Also, some of the powerups, mainly the directional locking ones, annoyed me a lot.  If the developers continue to work on it and improve it, I'm willing to give it another shot. At least it showed potential to be a decent game, if nothing else.",
