            "review_text": "First off , before I go any further into this review I would like to state that the ONLY way to play this game is to :  1) Turn off the in game music 2) Download the Daft Punk 'Tron Legacy' OST (preferably the 2 disc one with all the bonus tracks) 3) Replace the in game music with said OST 4) Get your Tron on  Ok so I'd like to start by saying that I don't play any types of mobile IOS or Android type games (regardless of the argument of whether they should exist on Steam or not) let alone any type of endless runners. I actually had to go find You Tube footage of numerous endless runner type games so that I could make the same comparison that others (who seemingly have never played this) are making about the game. I can say for certain that this IS NOT LIKE ANY ENDLESS RUNNER AT ALL. The fact that you are running is about the only comparison I could find. Endless runners that I have seen dont have or let you :  a) Double jump into a flying mode b) Wall run c) Manilpulate the existance of platforms d) Destroy the enviroment e) Engage and destroy enemies f) Ninja dodge g) Ride awesome light cycles and do freestyle tricks with them h) etc. etc. etc.  I could go on and on about how this IS NOT LIKE ANY ENDLESS RUNNER AT ALL, but if you still want to believe it after what you just read , then I can't help you. To the rest of you, here is an amazing Tron game with a great pricetag!  I like games that I can get in and out of and test my reflexes within a matter of minutes, e.g- 'Race the Sun, Spelunky, Nidhog' and this scratched that itch perfectly. Amazing levels with great artstyle true to the 'TRON' universe. Great disc upgrading and perk systems and fast and precise platform style running gameplay. When I got into serious sessions with this game (albeit with the Daft Punk blasting) I would finish the levels feeling ultra powerful, highly skilled, and generally vibrating with excitment.  Great little game and totally worth of the price!",

            "review_text": "I waited until the game was on sale but was very interested in its bright, colorful graphics and thumping soundtrack. As I'm already a fan of Tron, I may be a bit biased in praising the game.   However, as far as runners go it offers some of the most variety beyond the simple platforming / dodging of the genre.   I am not a fan of the lightcycle / bike segments in the title, as they feel pretty clumsy with the driving. The on-foot segments shine though and have abilities you can equip before going into the levels to amplify your score or wipe out an entire section of obstructions at once.   The ability to customize your character / cycle, as well as Interesting platforming variety with rails to grind on, walls to run on, a double jump + glide, slide, and tank fire to dodge while taking out enemies invading the area.   The effects, fluidity, and soundtrack all go well together. If you're into the colorful effects and overall digital world of Tron, or just wanting to give the 'Runner' genre a try, this is a title I'd recommend.",

            "review_text": "This is an excellent endless runner set in the TRON universe, with visuals inspired by the last TRON movie, TRON: Evolution, and the TRON: Uprising TV-series, though DLC characters will be made available soon from the original TRON movie. It has everything you would want from an endless runner, including two different 'campaigns' of sorts consisting of 16 levels each. In the first, Disc mode, you run through a particular track towards the finish, gaining points along the way and trying to get a three-star rating. In Cycle mode, you basically do the same thing, but using a light cycle. A third mode is Stream, which is classic endless running, where you will also switch between walking on foot to driving a light cycle and vice versa.   The difficulty ramps up nicely as you play through the various modes. You have to run and jump along the track, slide underneath obstacles, run along walls, grind on rails, and defeat enemies using your disc. Enemies are either other standing programs (sometimes deployed via Recognizer) or moving grid bugs. Sometimes, a light tank will pop up and you have limited time to defeat it before getting damaged yourself. You can buy special abilities and helper programs to make life a little easier, using a currency consisting of bits (you get an ample supply of these when you buy the game and more are earned by simply playing the game).   Graphically, the game looks really nice, running on Unreal Engine 4. Everything has an electronic glow like you would expect and the surfaces are hard and reflective. In motion, it looks even more fantastic. Gameplay is solid. I have only played the game using an XBox 360 controller and I think that's probably the preferred way to play it. If there is one problem, it's that the game currently doesn't have a Quit option: you have to hit Escape on the keyboard on the title screen to quit the game, which strikes me as a curious oversight.",

GAME SOMETIME STOPS ALL COMPUTER if you minimaze game (specially then on loading screen), but it's fine if you are not doing.  I like running levels itself. They are not easy and require practice. I don't know why it says partial-controller support, but you can do everything with controller. Motoauto levels are fine. It's exciting game to play with friends on couch. Bought it for 8eur (deluxe).   ALSO THERE IS DEMO VERSION OF THIS GAME. But this demo have worse optimization than the actual game.  And... why the ♥♥♥ there is /r in the title ? Is it some mistaken escaption symbol ? (lel)  After some month I feel wasted money on this game. Game is really badly optimized. Loading times for this simple Temple Run game is too long. And main menu interface is designed to use BIT's (gambling currency). I mean if you want to start game, you can press [Enter] [Enter] [Enter] ... and the last [Enter] before game start is to use BIT's instead of start level (wat?). And start level button is [Space] (wat?).",
