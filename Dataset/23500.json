            "review_text": "I can't help, but notice insane amount of negative reviews, bashing the game for all sorts of gameplay issues, i.e. constant crashes, unfair AI etc.  I played the game for couple of hours offline, so don't pay attention to time record, and I didn't experience a single crash (played on Win7 64bit, CPU: AMD, GPU: NVIDIA) I should try to play online a bit, if crashes occur - I'll update my comment. My only real complaint for current is the lack of controller support of any sorts.  Also I haven't find AI cheating at all. I admit, the enemy pretty much owned me at first, but, understandably, I accepted all my failures, because the board layout completely differs from original PQ series, so it takes time to learn the predictable patterns for falling tiles (truly, as the story take place in zero-gravity space, new tiles can be falling from all directions, not just from up-to-down) So, once you figure out how the board works - the enemies would become no problem. And learning new puzzle mechanics is always fair and interesting challenge.  Speaking of the space setting: that's another thing you can easily praise 'PQ: Galactrix' for. They have successfully managed to rework the whole mechanics of the original game and blend in the usual space fiction tropes with new gameplay features (say, for example, aforementioned zero-gravity battle grid with tiles falling from all directions or the mandatory for space games mining business, that was combined here with useful weapon crafting or selling the extracted minerals to the star systems, willing to pay the best price per ton.. Or selling the cargo cheaply to a hostile race to buy their loyalty)  The game atmosphere has heavily reminded me in many ways of 'Space Rangers' - another game series I love very much. Surely, Galactrix is a nice spin-off and worth at least the summer sale price, which is what I bought it for and thoroughly enjoyed playing the game - I'd say, give it a shot.",

            "review_text": "I find myself laughing at the sheer torrent of negative reviews I've found for this game, both here and everywhere else all over the Internet. Most of those can be written off as either 'I don't know how to play, so it's a bad game' or 'Nothing like the first Puzzle Quest game, so I don't like it'. People who write reviews with those sentiments as their core points should not be allowed to write reviews.  The puzzle board is a refreshing change to the standard 'match 3+ of a color' formula. Six directions allows for so many possibilities to surprise an enemy with a strange combo.  Combat is well-crafted and challenging, and there is always a way to win if you're willing to look for it, whether through a suddenly-favorable board configuration or a way to exploit the enemy's resources so they can't use their items while maximizing use of your own.  Hacking LeapGates does not deserve the massive level of criticism I've seen it get; it's a straightforward puzzle, with a simple goal. Yes, you have to hack every gate you want to pass through, but since people seem to think this is tedious, there's always an option to use your PSI points to open the gate automatically - and you're never going to run out of those unless you're reckless, or you use them to dodge every battle.  Haggling for discounts is small and motivating; you always want to do well. It's a minor annoyance that you have to do it for each item you want to buy or sell, but it only makes a real difference for the more expensive purchases like ships, so it's not a concern for the smaller items.  Rumor puzzles are well-designed, but serve little purpose other than as collectibles and experience. I do wish they would've played a larger role, because the puzzles are better than what they're used for.  The faction system is expansive and logical. If you make someone hate you, they'll make sure you don't pass through their worlds without a fight. I see little basis for the near-universal criticism of the game's characters, since the situation the universe is in pretty much justifies the near-total pessimism. And the fun part: it's entirely possible to become allies with literally every faction, except for the story's main antagonist - even the pirates.  I'd never heard of the Puzzle Quest series when I found this game. I'm a huge fan of puzzle games overall, and the RPG elements are a very welcome bonus. The negative reviews actually helped convince me to buy it, since it just seemed absurd that people would hate the game for things that have nothing to do with the actual gameplay. I did get it on a 90% sale, but that doesn't change anything. Galactrix is a beautiful, well-designed game.",

After four victories your faction will be powerful enough to use the special bonus granted by your secret base. 'Choose a planet to destroy.'

The board shape may change, the direction they drop may change, and so on.  Further, depending on how your 'ship' is outfitted, you will be trying to match different gems. For example, you may need to do 100 damage to an enemy to win, and your rockets deal 1 damage Per red gem on the board - but you also need to have removed atleast 10 to use it. Coupled that the AI will have their own strategy, and the game is turn based, makes for interesting gameplay.  You dip in and out and have great fun with it - just DO NOT expect much from the 'rpg' or 'story' elements. Those suck.",

            "review_text": "I can't recommend this.  The game has four different types of puzzles to my knowledge. I didn't get too far into it. They all play the same way, you group three, pieces slide around, you group another three until you finish. The first type is the 'battle' puzzles where you and an opponent take turns either grouping three or using a weapon but the random nature takes a lot of the fun out of these. I did pretty well with only a couple retrys but when I won, it was completely random. I would group three bombs, the pieces would slide into a combo, more bombs would appear on the board, they would slide into a combo, and I would win. No skill here, just randomness. Oh, and making a wrong move (IE: Moving pieces that don't make a group of three) results in taking ship damage. So you're punished for making mistakes.  Then there are the hacking puzzles. These are extremely tedious and nearly every star system has 2 star gates to hack and it becomes old fast. The hacking puzzles differ by being timed and having to group specific colors in a specific order (yellow, than red, than blue, than yellow again, etc). It is extremely frustrating because what color pieces are moved onto the board everytime you clear any is random and there are times where you spend 15 seconds just grouping random colors to get the ones you need to show up. You can group clocks to get 10 additional seconds but adding a few more seconds doesn't make these any more enjoyable.  The other two types are mining and crafting. Its the same group three. You 'mine' for materials by grouping three or more until you have no moves left. No complaints but you don't get to choose what you keep if you mine too much. It'll even what you mine and you'll have to sell to make room. You can use those minerials to 'craft' which is another group three puzzle.  After a little over three hours and about 30 puzzles, I wasn't having fun. Game also crashed four times during those two hours.",

            "review_text": "Props to Puzzle Quest for trying a new take on the format, but in the end it's not worth it. Some of the mini-games (for example, mining) are fun, and it's enjoyable to play it as a little space economy simulator, flying around systems to find the place that will pay the most for isotopes or technology or what have you. Unfortunately the combat, which is essential to advance the plot, is much worse than in either of the 2 'traditional' puzzle quest games. Both sides have shields which are recharged by matching blue hexes, and the hit points are higher so it becomes much more of a slog to do a significant amount of damage. Except, of course, that once you cascade 4 or 5 chains in a row you go 'nova' and then 'supernova', which doubles the value of matches, which means that lucking into a cascade like this can do 50 or 60 points of damage (about 4 hours into the game I was doing fights where both sides had around 90 hp and around 30 shields, and standard attacks were doing around 7 or 9). Combat then becomes a matter of trying to match shields and hold out long enough that you can luck in to crazy high damage cascades before the computer does. There are items that will let you do various other things in battle, but they're scattered around the systems which makes it a pain to try to find an upgraded laser or whatever. Just play puzzle quest 1 or 2 if you really need to scratch that match-3 itch.",
