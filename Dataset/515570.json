            "review_text": "So I happen to get this game by being bored and decided I would browse steam during the holloween sale for some cheap games. Saw this in the list and for some reason the Name of the game interested me. Got al three games and the OST for only $2.39. GREAT DEAL! Right away when I started playing it it was just amazing. You are like some punk samurai chick(that can also use gun) who must slay aliens and other things and you can also cut/block bullets.It never really gets boring either. You just always want to try and get a better score than you previously did :D. I would definitely recommend this game if you love like 8bit 3rd person shootem up games.",

            "review_text": "A challenging, but overall fun experience.  Sound and music is good; Songs are Rock/Metal with some electronic elements. Visuals are good if basic, but the action blurs all that anyway.  ===  WASD/Left Gamepad Stick = Movement Mouse/Right Gamepad Stick = Aim Reticle/Crosshairs *Mouse control of reticle navigates normally, but gamepad control of reticle follows stick position (resetting to center when stick is released to neutral position).  Right Click/Left Bumper &amp; Trigger Buttons = Sword Slash Left Click/Right Bumper &amp; Trigger Buttons = Shoot Gun  There is no pause ability while playing. Pressing Escape will end the match. No Button on Gamepad matches the Escape function.  ===  Menu has Play, Tutorial, Game Mode, and Exit actions. You can also view Badges earned and choose Your Class Mod Here on the Roulette, which only spins in one direction as far as I can tell.   Play  begins the battle. 90 Seconds to survive the horde of enemies. Default Start Weapon is a blade that can deflect/cut enemy bullets and kill if they collide with an enemy. Secondary Weapon (Main if you choose so) are the various plasma shooters the enemies drop with varying spread types (fat single projectile, two dot projectiles in a V path, many projectiless with a large spread, etc.). Only one gun can be held at a time and switches when going over a different gun type. Endless terrain with enemies attacking you from all directions. Changing weapons is not slow, but not extremely fast and requires skill to know when to switch for close-range attacks/deflections or medium/longe-ranged attacks. The amount of enemies makes this more difficult as you can leave yourself open.   Tutorial  allows you to test controls with your blade and offers 3 gun types to pick up and try out. No enemies appear in this mode.   Game Mode  changes between Classic and Hardboiled. Changing modes (difficulty) resets your best score.  Badges are tough milestones for each Class Mod. These milestones revolve around achieving at least 400+ KO's (one for 800+ KO's) or completing an Event (I believe this means surviving the 90 second match; I have not been able to do this).  Class Mods change how many times you can Respawn (how many times you can be hit in one match; this does not reset location/gear) and how many KO's (kills) it takes to activate Brainclap (projectiles burst outward from the player in all directions), as well as starting gear.  ===  Only issues I have noticed in my play-time so far are: the failure to deflect projectiles at times, the game crashes sometimes for unknown reasons at startup, and no Audio/Visual Settings. The deflect issue could be my fault for not doing a proper deflect, but hard to tell. The game has only crashed trying to start up, when it gets to the menu it seems to be safe from those crashes and has not happened while playing. The Visual settings are not anything I personally considered tweaking, but wished I could alter the Audio settings to lower the game volume while maintaining my PC volume for voice chat.",
