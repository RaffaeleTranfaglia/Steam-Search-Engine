            "review_text": "For an iOS game ported onto PC, this game really impressed me. Yeah it's an iOS port but it's a good port that one ups it's the original. PC version exclusively includes local co-op mode, vs. mode and full gamepad support. Best of all it includes a level editor. Personally I loved this game for the first few hours, it's addicting and the puzzles are fun. Although I did get bored of it after a while, then again I can see how other people love this game, there is so much content. Especially when playing with an extra person. The visuals are top notch but the gameplay is a bit like flappy bird (please don't give me crap for this). I know, this game came before flappy bird but we all know this game overshadowed this. The controls are very well responsive, so if you die it is your own doing. It does get a little repetitive and times and frustrating but it is fun. 7/10",

The game designers really though this one through. It's hard enough to be absolutely sure you won't make it, but in the end you always do because in the previous level they taught you everything you needed to know to finish this level succesfully. This is how great gameplay should be.   + easy controls + pick-ups make it challenging + great puzzle/platformer level design  + lovely design  + actually, everything is great",

            "review_text": "Let me just say that I was one of the first to buy this game when it came out on Android, and it became my favorite mobile game. It still is! And when I saw it was ported onto Steam, I bought it ASAP. What do I think of the port? It's great. It can be a bit unnerving to be able to go backwards now, unlike the mobile version, but it is a very minor problem that I quickly adjusted to.  The art is fantastic, the atmosphere sometimes sunny, sometimes scary, but always mysterious. There is no soundtrack, but the ambience and sound effects greatly add to the tone.  This version has bonus worlds, which really expands the game from what it used to be.  And multiplayer has never been better. It was amazing on Android, the great race against your friends to see who can best survive the chaotic environment. Not only does this game have more unique multiplayer levels, it also has an added co-op too!  The power-ups are fun, I love becoming a mammoth beast that crushes everything, or a swarm of swift creatures that are difficult to kill in numbers.  The difficulty of levels increases nicely too, and I never find myself too frustrated to continue the game.  So do I reccomend this game? Of course! From its great visuals to entertaining gameplay, it is truly a gem. It may not be my favorite game on Steam (Papers, Please, but THAT'S another review), but BADLANDS is definitely an entertaining game to pick up.",

            "review_text": "badland is in an incredible fun and unqiue game with challenging but enjoyable gameplay.  Badland is a mobile port. I have played the original and I thoroughly enjoyed it on android and I thorughly enjoyed it on there. Having played this version I was very sceptical about it being released on PC. The controls of the game on mobile are extremely simple. All you do is tap the screen to go up and let go to go down. I didn't think this would work out well for a PC game.  What badlands does to combat this problem is introduce a simple but definitely well needed feature. They make it so you can go left and right. You may think I seem completely crazy even advertising this as a feature, but trust me, without it the game would feel so bland on PC. As far as I can see the levels have also been edited to go with this change and you do need to use the movement to get to certain parts of the level. Not as much as I would have hoped though. The majority of the game you do still only use up. Which can make the game drag at some points.   Outside of the trailer the game has no story. The trailer basically tells the story of them being clones and that is about it. I would have personally liked some kind of basic story but it isn't entirely necessary. You should definitely watch that trailer by the way because it is incredible!  The challenge of the game is provided by use of obstacles and power ups. The screen moves along automatically. You need to try and keep up with this. If your character ends up going off the screen you will fail. There are also obstacles with spikes and such to avoid as well and these get increasingly hard to avoid as you go along through the game. Pretty standard gameplay really but it still does what it needs to do well.  But the real thing that gets the gameplay going is the powerups. You start the game with a few standard power ups that you can pick up during levels. These include size powerups to make your clone bigger or smaller, clone powerups to make copies of yourself and many more. You unlock more as you go throughout the game. The powerups are necessary for you to progress through the levels and you need to make sure to use them correctly to progress. This adds a real great element to the standard gameplay presented.  Now what you will probably notice immediately is the incredible graphics the game has. It adds a real nice style and nice depth of colour to the gameplay. Many of the levels give a very dark vibe and then others give a nice colourful vibe. These contrast well with each other. I'm not certain, but I believe the PC version also has had a high upgrade in the graphics and looks way better.  The biggest problem I found with badland is the laziness of parts of the mobile port. The menu seems to have just been ported straight over, without being edited, from mobile. This means that to navigate parts of the menu you have to slide your mouse accross the screen. While this method of control works great on mobile it isn't nice to have to do this with a mouse. You then just have the fact that the menu looks extremely mobile like. I mean the buttons are rather simplified to fit with a small screen on mobile. You even have a facebook and twitter button.   The options menu does mostly stick with this trend as well. Initially the only option your presented with is a sound slider. It is only one slider and there are no seperate sliders for music and sounds or anything else. You do also have a very basic graphics options menu. This includes HD graphics, bloom, V-sync and fullscreen. But there are no resolution options or other customizable graphics options. There is also a controls menu with completely rebindable keys.  Overall I have to say that I did thoroughly enjoy playing badland and will definitely go back to it and enjoy the highly challenging gameplay. I am nowhere near to completing it and I can only imagine it will get much harder. I would definitely recommend it to any fan of a challenging platformer. And the price is cheap for it as well!

            "review_text": "Before I write the review, I just want to say how awesome the people at Frogmind (the people who made the game) are. They did something on Facebook where the first 50 people who message them would get a free Steam key, which I sadly missed. However, I contacted them anyway, and they gave me one! It's so nice nice to see a company who values their customers so highly. Anyway, onto the review.  I got this game on iPad about half a year ago, and it was one of my favourite games. It has a really nice art style, and the physics are awesome. Even when you complete single player, multiplayer never gets boring. Indeed, how can it be, when you are constantly knocking your friends into circular saws or blowing them up. I always appreciated the regular updates, which constantly brought in new content, something which I expect they will continue in the new game.  I really like the function in GOTY edition that allows you to move back, something that I always wanted in the first game. It also has 4 times as much content as the original one, and 15 hours of playing time, which is ridiculous for just £6.99. It seems a realistic estimate as well, considering how long it has taken me to get as far as I am.  The only 2 asks I have of this game are: bring in online multiplayer (which according to their website they are already considering), and please add in a level customizer, it would be so awesome!  Overall, this is a great game, which I would definitely reccomend getting.",

            "review_text": "Control a floating black puffball through a gauntlet of things that want to kill it.   The developers came up with a lot of great ideas to flesh out this concept. The powerups are imaginative and fun, and the level design works with them beautifully. The best stages are a blast to play through as you bounce through rapidly-spinning gears or navigate a whole swarm of puffballs through a shredding machine. Only one may survive, but hey, that's all you need!  I wish I could end the review here and give this my recommendation. Unfortunately, about 30% of the levels in the second half of the game take place in near or complete darkness. You have to navigate through mazes with no feedback except the glowing eyes of your puffball failing to move towards the right as they bump up against an invisible wall. Then you die and start over - yes, there's a time limit of just a few seconds.  Some levels pull this dark maze trick off, but it's only fun when you're controlling a whole swarm of puffballs, and you can use them as a sort of 'throwing flour on a ghost' trick to work out where the walls are. But there were numerous times where I had no such option available and had to just (literally) bang my head against a wall until I found the correct path.   BADLAND is a good game with a major flaw that comes up far too often. On the plus side, they are very generous with save points and you do have the ability to skip sections you've failed multiple times. If you play this, you'll get a lot of enjoyment, but also a great deal of frustration.",

There isn't anything really wrong with that: Limbo, NightSky, and BADLAND are all very pretty games. Badland falls short of the other two, though. It rushes the player through the world in the pursuit of frantic action, without giving much depth to the action that it provides. More often than not, puzzles are solved through blind luck. Even still, the mediocre gameplay would be allright if it came with a nice soundtrack or compelling story... which this game does not. Pick this up for idle amusement on a mobile device if you like, but there are better ways to spend your time on a PC.",
