            "review_text": "'Midsummer Night' is a beautiful, little indie gem. It tells an interesting tale (probably based on Russian folklore), features great pixel art, a decent soundtrack and plays with your emotions. It ranges from eery, dark and gloomy to heartwarming and touching. Taking around 2 hours to complete, achievements suggest that there is way more to do and explore than I actually did during the 1st playthrough,  so there definitely is some replay value here. I absolutely enjoyed playing 'Midsummer Night' and was sucked in by it's charm immediately. If you like pixel graphics and nice story-telling, this game is for you! ",

I got this game for 25 Indian Rupees. Its a Thumbs up from me. I recommend this game for the ones looking for foresty/flowery atmosphere.",
