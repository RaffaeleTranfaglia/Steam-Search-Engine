That's one thing that has always bugged me with shoot 'em ups. Having to only go head-on with an enemy the traditional way forced very linear battles, either vertical or horizontal. The big question I had was, would it work?          YouTubeâ„¢ Video:  Xenoraid&nbsp;",

            "review_text": "  The best thing about Xenoraid is how weighty it feels. You definitely get the sensation your ship is a real object swerving in space, and I love that. I can't help but wonder if Xenoraid over complicates things, though; most great shooters have a minimalist style, and honestly, the story isn't all that good or interesting. Yet, the extra tactical bits that the game adds-like bringing a full squadron into battle and being able to switch the active fighter at will-is very cleverly used, with deep mechanics worth exploring.",
