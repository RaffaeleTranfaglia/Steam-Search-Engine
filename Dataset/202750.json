            "review_text": "A dramatic shift from the first game, 'American Nightmare' pushes the franchise more towards the action/shooter genre than the survival/horror of its first iteration. with plentiful reloads and ammo pick-ups, resource management is never a concern, which is fortunate as enemies are never in short supply either. The game still boasts impressive graphics, although the entire adventure is spread across only three maps, which you will frequently revisit. However, rather than feeling repetitive, each time you return to a map there are new challenges and I quickly came to appreciate the lessons I had learned from my last visit. The story is more fantastic and, at least in my opinion, slightly creepier thanks to the addition of new character (and Alan Wake's evil doppleganger) Mr. Scratch. The first game lacked an identifiable personification of evil with whom the player could relate (and hate); Mr Scratch fulfills that need very well. The adventure is fairly short but enjoyable throughout.",

            "review_text": "This is a pretty big departure from the original Alan Wake, but i don't really see the hate towards this that some people have. If you approach this like this should be approached, by considering this a shooter you will have fun. Gone are the good storyline (although there are some fun bits in this one), suspense, atmosphere and detailed locations of the original, this is a shooting fest for few hours set in the same world, and expanding the lore/plot of the original.  The combat itself is fluid, they seemed to concentrate on that mostly, which is understandable, but still the levels feel very empty. They're small and not crafted with the same passion that we had before. Basically they're just there to house some dudes in for you to shoot. The timeloop aspect of the plot, gives us some funny moments and pieces of dialoque, but it also makes running the levels a bit tedious.  Manuscript pages are back, and this time they're used to unlock weapons :D I don't know is that a good thing or not when thinking about how important part they were in on the last game, where we didn't really have much combat at all, but at least it's somehow funny when you look at it. And guns are plenty, but the bad guys come in shamefully low numbers for us who have accustomed to shooters. Game does offer arcade mode also so we aren't limited only to the campaign, but it's 10 minutes per level. If you want to shoot hordes of Taken, better be fast!  This is fun for a few hours, but this goes in the same category as Elder scrolls online vs Skyrim. People marched into ESO thinking it's the new skyrim because it had the same name. Yes, you play as Alan here, but he's ♥♥♥♥♥♥, he's had enough of this darkness nonsense, and he has the firepower to back his frustration!",

I am so glad I didn't pass it up, it is worth buying even if it is not on sale!  While this game is not nearly as long as the original, the story will draw you in. I had a hard time putting the game down once I began playing the story mode. It is similiar to the originial in that there are manuscripts to collect, radio shows to listen to and also T.V. recordings to watch. You will also see some familiar characters.  The combat system is so very fluid! The combat in this game is addicting in itself and outside of the story there is plenty of arcade levels to enjoy the combat! The mechanics are nearly the same as the original but there are tons of weapons to find and unlock in this game! There are also several new enemies that were not in the original, each which requires a different tactic to take down effectively. And that brings me to my last highlight of the game..  Mr. Scratch! After seeing him in this game he is now my favorite villain of all time. He is so different from anything else I have seen in a game and he is definitely the biggest highlight of the game. The actor that plays him(and Alan Wake himself) is phenomenal!!   I can not wait for another sequel!",

            "review_text": "Alan Wake's American Nightmare is a fun game. But compared to its predecessor, it is definitely not as good. It doesn't live up to the first Alan Wake, mainly because they didn't put as much effort into it.  On the good side of things, Alan Wake's American Nightmare presents a brand new story that is very interesting, but it is a bit of a stretch from the first game. The weapon system is fun, making you collect manuscript pages to unlock new guns. The enemies are also new, improving on the plain minions from the previous installments. They introduce an all new Arcade Mode as well, and it provides entertainment for those that have finished the Main Story. Plus the game improves on the graphics, looking better than ever.  But, there are some bad things. The story is extremely short, especially taking into account you go to the same areas 3 times. Yes, it is a part of the story, but they should've considered making it more interesting. Increasing the difficulty each time isn't going to win you Game of the Year. The story in itself gets pretty boring. Fans of Alan Wake will enjoy it more, but it just doesn't pull you in. It doesn't do very much to keep your interest, relying on the gamer to finish the game just because they paid money for it, and they should get their money's worth. The new characters (everyone except Alan) are not that enticing either; they don't make you sympathize/get attached to them. And finally, the game is easy. I beat the game in three hours. That's just unprofessional.  It may sound like I hate the game, but I don't. The story is an episode of Night Springs that Alan wrote, putting Mr. Wake in a time loop set by his dark side. Alan must perfect everything in order to defeat his evil self, or be sent back in time to relive the defeat all over again, until he suceeds. The ending is decent, and it isn't that bad of a story overall. But it fails to make an impression that rivals the previous game or any other best seller. There is some replay value, but not much. The Arcade Mode is pretty much the only reason to go back to the game.  In summary, this game is for fans of Alan Wake. So make sure you've played that one first. The game has an okay story, but some great improvement, like new enemies and better graphics, but it just isn't as good as the first.  Score: 7/10 - Good",

It isn't.  What it is, is a totally awesome direct sequel of the first game. If you liked the original Alan Wake then you've got to play this one as well. It continues on the same plot from the first game, and brings it through to a satisfying conclusion (one which many felt the original game lacked). If the base game of Alan Wake is part one, then the DLC for the original game, combined American Nightmare, is part two.  It took me about 6 hours to complete, according to Steam, so bear that in mind when you're looking to buy it.  It's just as satisfying and fun as the first game, with some new enemies and a different environment format. Instead of the more linear style of the first game, this one gives you three open-world areas to explore and complete tasks in. They aren't huge, but they don't feel small, and I think any bigger would make them a pain in the ♥♥♥♥ to traverse.  American Nightmare is a must-play for fans of the original. However if you haven't played the first one, don't even touch this American Nightmare until you have,",

But where Alan Wake's combat got pretty samey a few chapters in, American Nightmare's combat got samey almost immediately, and although Wake is supposed to be experienced at this sort of thing now, there was basically no tension. There were quite a few 'Oh crap' moments in the first game where the game would have a genuine surprise ready to throw at me. Not so in Nightmare.  The story (though I will not spoil) is also pretty light-weight. The big bad shows up to taunt you, throws some mooks at you, rinse and repeat. The nature of the Wakeverse is such that ambiguity about what's going on is entirely appropriate, but in Nightmare the writers seemed to use it as an excuse to avoid writing.  Buy Alan Wake, but you can readily give this one a pass.",

            "review_text": "If you haven't played Alan Wake, you might actually enjoy this, but won't really understand what's happening plot-wise, if you have played Alan Wake, you should definitely pick this up because it fixes a lot of the mechanics from the main game and adds more to the Alan Wake storyline.  This was released as DLC to the main game but it works as a stand alone title, and I believe it was originally meant to be a complete sequel but they only got funded for this size project.  If you enjoyed Alan Wake, but disliked the flashlight and shooting mechanics, you'll really appreciate this as the gunplay and combat is vastly improved. The enemy types are similar to the last game, and although they follow the same formula of flashlight-stun-shoot they have different abilities and appearances.  This game is set in the Arizona desert as opposed to the last games lush Pacific Northwest forests. The setting makes for a nice change of pace, and the big open landscape is really beneficial to the combat and exploration in my opinion. Also, whereas the last game took a lot of cues from American horror literature... and Twin Peaks. This game takes more cues from American horror films, and television, specifically the Twilight Zone, and it's very well off for it.  The story doesn't do as much as I would like in continuing the storyline from the first game but is still fairly interesting on it's own as it gives glimpses into what's going on in 'the real world.' I think the developers wanted to do more in that regard, but held back because they're still hoping to do a proper sequel at some point.  Finally, I'm not sure if it's because of the restraints on the development or just a design choice but the biggest drawback of the game is the constant backtracking. You replay each area at least three times due to a weird time travel element in the storyline. Although it does get sped up each time due to you changing things in the past it's still fairly annoying, I would have preferred more areas, or just a shorter experience honestly.  Overall though, the game is a good indication of the potential of the Alan Wake franchise in my opinion. I hope eventually a Publisher takes note of American Nightmare and decides to fund an actual Alan Wake 2 at some point.",

There was something (albeit admittedly something frustrating) to be said for the tension of frantically hand loading individual revolver rounds as the shadows closed in on you.  Where as the main game you slogged through the combat for the story, this almost takes the opposite approach... they spice up the combat but the story is a little less... riveting. Its not terrible, its just not going to live up to the main game there.   All in all its a decent little diversion for Alan Wake fans, but I wouldn't chalk it up as a must play.  (7/10)",

But under all its bad features there are some good things about this game. The game has a slow motion feature which adds more action to the mix. The arcade mode is just a simple survival mode.

The whole game is just way too easy, you can refill all your batteries and ammo to maximum all the time and most of the unlockable weapons weren't worth exploring the area to find the pages to unlock them with in the first place.  The first game suffered from being repetitive and what do they do this time? Make it even more repetitive by making you play the game three times. Combat is a little tighter thanks to having automatic weapons and limitless ammo strewn about all the time but that dissolves what little tension there is. As a big fan of the first game I can not recommend this to anyone, but rather just watch the cut scenes on youtube because the rest of the game is just shooting fish in a barrel with an assault rifle with a bottomless magazine.",

            "review_text": "It would be hard for me to talk about American Nightmare without touching on the original Alan Wake, because it very much feels like DLC that got spun into its own game. Alan Wake's strengths were its story, pacing, and graphics. The combat was a bit of a toss-up between decent and monotonous, depending on who you asked. American Nightmare is a shorter, weirder story told across three mostly open areas that you visit multiple times. The visuals are still sharp, but lose a lot of the atmosphere that Alan Wake had... the open desert just doesn't have the same creep factor as the dark woods, at least not as it's shown here. Dialogue is pretty snappy and clever, but it's propping up a story that really adds nothing to the themes introduced in Alan Wake.  So the main draw is the combat, and to its credit, it's a little more interesting than in Alan Wake. Enemy encounters are varied in makeup, and there are some new foes like ones that split if you shine light on them and creepy jumping spider things. All the original weapons are here, along with new additions like a nailgun, uzi, and carbine. You can unlock weapon cases with additional weapons by finding manuscript pages scattered around which encourages exploration, but honestly as large as the areas are, there's not much to find. Enemies only appear as you follow the main plot, and the game showers you with ammo and flare, more than enough to handle any situation. I tried playing on the harder of the two difficulties and the battles were still a breeze with all the resources I had, but I could be killed in just two hits which led to some frustration with unlucky hits at the ends of long fights.  There's an arcade mode similar to the mercenaries modes in Resident Evil that's pretty fun, assuming you like the combat. And that's really what American Nightmare boils down to, did you like the combat in Alan Wake? If so, this is for you, but don't come looking for the atmosphere or story of the original.",

It's a lot more open than the main campaign, but it's still rather linear, in that there is only ever one objective that can be done at a time, but you can roam around and explore. The areas aren't very big, and you can't freely travel between them, but this kind of gives me a taste of what the main campaign could have been like if it were designed as an open world game instead of being as utterly claustrophobic as it was.  This standalone DLC made quite a few changes from the original game, but not all of them were good. In the original Alan Wake, there were 4 weapons. In this one, there are 2 pistols, 2 rifles, 3 shotguns, 2 automatic weapons, a flaregun, and a nailgun. While choice is always good, some of the weapons are insanely overpowered, and some are just pointless. It seems like the developers took people's complaints about the main game's combat system to mean that combat was too difficult (it wasn't), and made it easier. Unfortunately, that means combat is now a cakewalk. Ammo is RIDICULOUSLY plentiful, weapons are insanely powerful, and enemies will barely ever even get close enough to hit you. Throughout the whole game, I got hit maybe 4 times, used 1 handheld flare, never fired the flaregun, and totally forgot I even HAD flashbangs.  They beefed up the flashlight as well. The enemies seem like they take less light to burn away the darkness, and the flashlight recharges CRAZY fast. From completely empty, it will charge to full in about 3 seconds, including the 1-2 second delay before it even starts charging. I was playing on Normal (there's only normal and nightmare), too, but maybe in this game that's the equivalent of easy.  The story is still rather interesting in this expansion, but the writing and voice acting are HORRIBLE. I mean absurdly stupid at times. I'm all for campy fun, but sometimes it gets so ridiculous that it really pulls you out of the experience. Speaking of acting, the little 'TV' segments where your dark self talks to you go on WAY too long sometimes, and don't really play any importance in how the game unfolds (and you don't get any achievements for them or anything).  Overall I liked this. The story and acting took a step backwards from the main game, but you're not confined to the stupid outdoor tunnel sections (running through the woods), and combat doesn't get in your way as horrifically as it did in the main game either.  It's rather short, so don't pay $20 for it or anything, but I enjoyed it. Your results may vary, of course.",

Results are the same for the player. Developers got an idea to use a time twist physics theory. It allowed them to literally recycle thir product multiple times. Only three maps exist in the game and the only major difference is amount of enemies. This in turn leads to runing out of ammo in the late game, causing multiple, frustrating deaths in row due to lack of melee combat option.  Combat itself is limited to blinding enemies with flashlight which causes them to stop moving and become vunerable for bullets  All this increases the lenght of the game, it dosenät help much though becouse it took me only 1,5 h to complete whole game.  Luckly the developers had enough reason to remove same aleready done objectives every time i repeated the map, so it aint a complete disaster.   Plot of the game is very similar to another title 'Cryostasis', With different location and few combat differenses. For examle you will fight darknes zombies with light and firearms, instead of ice zombies with heat and firearms.  Ending is also quite predictable and resembles cheap horror movies from 1970:s .

While less of a sequel than a low-budget side-story, the series still enjoys playing with the pacing of a level, giving you brief periods of exploration before attacking you at your more vulnerable moments. This is damged somewhat by the re-use of levels in the game, but the justification for this and the different approaches taken each time you revisit an area is very well done.  Where this game shines the most, however, is the story. Alan is trapped in Night Springs, the Twiligh Zone-esque show he created early in his career. While the previous predecesor explained his ability to change reality through writing only gave him the briefest glimmers of hope, this rendition allows gamers to experience a writer's power trip, one that allows Alan to quite literally rock the heavens after some careful planning and skill.  A special mention must also be given to the game's villian, Mr. Scratch. While the idea of an evil twin is a bit of a cliche, Mr. Scratch's showboating in everything he does is consistently entertaining.

            "review_text": "If you liked Alan Wake, then this one can be considered action 'sequel' in which is emphasized 'action', so actually the name of a game should be 'Alan Wake's American Dream' since you get almost double amount type of weapons, like crosbow, uzi, automatic shotty etc..  Enemy count is also much bigger and interesting designed but the style of gameplay is almost the same. You are Alan the writer dude who is thrown in a desert of Arizona (don't ask me how he got there, you know writers, all alcoholics, he probably doesn't remember how his ♥♥♥ got stranded there) and is trying to defeat his nemesis bla bla spoiler.  In contrast to first 'sequel' is that this one is relatively shorter (much shorter) and poorer story wise.. It's pretty straight forward with not many plot twists (if any..), naration is very good, you collect manuscripts again that explains the story and Alan's actions.. Antagonist is really funny and interesting guy with twisted sense of humor hehe.. I pretty much enjoyed all his videos ingame hehe, almost started to root for the guy haha  PRO - very good graphics, level and enemy design, sound is pretty good - more weapons, more enemies, more fights, more slow motion kills :) which can irritate some people though, - good playability, - new game mode (arcade) which is made only for shootin' and killin' those mofos, you need to survive til sunrise which is 10 minutes per round..  CONS - since the emphasize is on fight, there is small number of puzzles (but there weren't many puzzles in the first one so..).. - weak story in contrast of first part and it's shortness and predictability.  This one is fun to play as long as you don't have expectations from the first 'sequel'. Story is not on the level it should/could have been, it is obvious they were 'saving it' for Alan Wake 2, but it is doubtful that AW 2 will ever be made though (see Quantum Break)..  If you can get this game somewhere on the cheap, buy it, play it, enjoy the combat in this 'action shooter survival, NOT adventure game', but somehow, even though I'm a fan of Alan Wake, I don't think this sequel, if you can call it sequel, is really worth 10 bucks..

            "review_text": "It's hard to recommend this one. It should've been included with the main game, rather than being a standalone game. It's too short for one and it's repetitive as hell. There's also less humour and subtleties. It's more action oriented and 'dumbed down' than the main game. If you're looking for a fairly simple and short action shooter, then you might get more enjoyment out of this game than I did. Sorry, but this game just didn't do it for me.  The acting's better this time around though (except for the British scientist lady, her delivery is dreadful). The soundtrack still kicks ♥♥♥ as it did in the main game.",

Using the laws of the world they established in the first Alan Wake game, Remedy give us more to play with while biding time for the inevitable Alan Wake 2.   You don't have to scratch your head trying to figure out the plot in this one, just pick up the flashlight and enjoy the action.

            "review_text": "Don't get this expecting a full game. It's roughly a DLC, but the intro to the story is bundled in with the main game (the two Special episodes), so it gains an Arcade mode to add a bit of substance. A word of warning: for about the first third of the game, I was worried that it was utterly, inexplicably terrible. Luckily, it's not. It is, though, mediocre, a bit tedious, and lacks the charm and depth of the original.  The quickest way to explain it, in my mind, is that it feels like it was made by a different group with different priorities. Manuscript pages now unlock weapons, for no particularly well-defined reason. Ammo caches are scattered around the map, but this leads to some oddly low caps for items (5 flares, 5 flashbangs, 10 batteries). There's a bit more of an open-world feel, but the areas are small (you don't get a map, and realistically don't need one) and it leads to a lot of ugly invisible walls. There's a nice variety of new enemies, but generic enemies are basically all you fight (no 'boss battles' and just a few poltergeists). The villain is a fairly interesting character, but it feels like he doesn't really get his chance to shine (er, no pun intended - his TV bits are reasonably well done but his short appearances ingame are underwhelming).  Now, most of these are tradeoffs - there's plenty that's different, but it's not objectively worse. The real problem, as far as I'm concerned, is that the story and the overall flow of the game - which are pretty directly connected - just don't work this time around, certainly not in the way that they did so well in the original.  The entire game takes place in three areas, each of which has a living population of precisely one attractive woman, which considering that in theory Wake is doing all the writing is more than a bit weird (there's arguably an excuse for him, but then there's not for the developers). The central mechanic of properly 'setting up' significant story points from the manuscript is actually pretty neat, but it's hamstrung by another central mechanic which isn't explained well, runs contrary to the concept of Wake having to write a coherent story, and leads to a lot of the gameplay feeling like doing the same thing over and over again in a way that isn't particularly interesting.  If you're looking for some more refined Alan Wake gameplay, this is a neat little DLC. If you're looking for a worthy continuation of the story, you might actually want to stay away. Overall, I'll give it a hesitant recommendation; there's a decent game under it all - it's just not Alan Wake.",

And any survival aspect of ammo conservation is also gone, as there are infinite ammo boxes scattered liberally about every level. The weapon-unlock boxes you find smack of artificial longevity by forcing replays to get better weapons.",
