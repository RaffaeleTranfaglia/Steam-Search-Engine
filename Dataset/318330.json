I tried this game, and had so much fun with it.  Try one of their game. It costs only as much as a burger, and lasts much longer.",

Your choices matter, they have a gravitas in them that similar 'choice games' such as Mass Effect lack, and it's LONG. You'll want to replay the heck out of it trying to get different endings. Love it! I honestly hope they do a sequel, or at least another story in the same genre.",

There are also character stats, which increase or decrease based on the decisions you make through out the game. If this sounds like something you're interested in, then I'd say definitely give Mecha Ace a shot. I've never played a CYOAB before, but my love of mecha anime seriously made me enjoy the time I've spent so far on this little gem.",

            "review_text": "I'm going to have to agree with what a lot of other people said in terms of irrelevant choices. While playing this game, it felt as if I wasn't really in control or influencing the story aside from small details. A lot of the time it seemed as if the game did not approve of my choices i.e 'what would you like to do?' *picks option* 'Unfortunately since you did not pick (insert option here), you didn't (insert possible outcome of option you did not pick).' I wasted a lot of time restarting from checkpoints trying to get better outcomes because I was essentially told I could have done it a certain way and gotten a better result. Situations such as these made me feel as if there was some ideal story the author wanted me to follow instead of being free to choose my own, which was counterintuitive to why I bought the game.   Most of the choices made only have the consequence of effecting a 'stat' such as how diplomatic you are or how much will you have. these choices only matter at critical points in the story and very few other times. I will admit the story started to bore me towards the end, but maybe that's just me. I bought the game expecting a lot more combat and actual fighting than exposition and unfortunately that's not what I got (my kill count by the end was somewhere around 73 but 63 of those kills were given to me at the start of the game as background). While it may seem like I am being harsh, I did enjoy the game and you can't beat the price so I reccomend it.",

            "review_text": "God damn this game is difficult. I mean that the choices are extremely hard to make and what they will lead to is hard to determine, every choice means something and you can't just go back on it without suffering some losses. And that is a good thing. Sometimes with Choice of Games's games I can just rn through them and easily find the best scenario ending, but this one, gosh, I haven't I even finished it because I don't have the heart to see everything crumble around me and not go my way. This game gives a good dose of cold, hard reality and that gives it heart.",
