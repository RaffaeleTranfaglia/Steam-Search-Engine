    "description": "Onechanbara Z2: Chaos is the latest entry in the Onechanbara series. Two sets of buxom vampire sisters battle through over a dozen stages of high-octane real-time swordplay. Fight off the invasion in gruesome detail, occasionally transforming into a demon for short bursts of added power and speed.",

I love the combat, the fast character swapping combos, the music, the girls wearing only the most needed clothing items for combat, and all of it! HOWEVER, there are a few issues you need to know before purchasing this game! First, there are NO graphics options at all. So if you do not think your rig is a great gaming rig, I would reccomend buying the game to see how it runs for you, then returning it if it is unplayable. Also, there is a very strange issue with the audio in this game. It chops up often and VERY badly! Not to the point of it ruining the game, but it can get annoying at times. I am playing with a gamepad and there are no complaints from me on the controls. They are fast and feel responsive (no idea how this game is on keyboard and mouse). I hope this review could help anyone on the fence about buying this game :)",

            "review_text": "I have to recommend this game for two big, well-rounded reasons. The first being the fast and complex gameplay system, that demands skillful play and rewards it with a spectacular zombie massacre. The second reason, of course, is the girls themselves, who aren't only well-shaped but customizable as well.  This is without a doubt the breast iteration of this series.",

            "review_text": "It's a really fun game for casual players.  In terms of replayability, this game isn't that great. I've managed to beat normal,hard,violent,and berserk difficulty within 16hours of playtime.  After you've maxed out Kagura, the game will become easy to a point where it seems boring. Bosses are extremely easy to kill on any diffculty.(I've killed the final boss and berserk diffucly in 30 seconds...this is just pathetic) The only time that you'd have a hard time on the bosses is your first time playing the game. If you're looking for a challenge, try to avoid buying weapons and rings. The technique ring pretty much breaks the game.  Overall, I'd recommend buying this game, it is a really fun experience.",

            "review_text": "Been a fan since the first release on PS2 with the Simple 2000 Series. I was very happy that they finally released one for PC. The game is quite enjoyable if you like hack&amp;slash, beautiful protagonist, zombies or the combination of these. The story is typical (so far), but spices it up with variation of intro, comic cuts and general conversations between the characters.   When I first bought this game, the first intro was unwatchable and the game just did not run smoothly enough, but thanks to the patches it almost runs normally.  Pros: Nice graphics Slightly erotic girls Mass fighting  Cons: Audio fails during screen changes (it sound like you are in a hangar), which caused the game to crash for me during some intros FPS drops sometimes Full screen mode has a widow It feels like it is running on an emulator  It has some flaws but if these will be fixed with patches in the future the game has potential. Please fix these issues, because I really liked it so far! Cheers",

It is quite evident that the developers spent a great deal of time trying to make a game with good graphics at least for the main characters .    I have looked at both the negative reviews of this product and the positive ones .The deciding factor seems to be if the game runs well or not. Not on the game content . Some of the other negative reviews are really filled with hate for this product which I can understand almost $50 for one game is a lot of money for some people .    f you own the game there is $66.73 worth of DLC you can purchase The DLC is not in fact new game areas or new campaigns or add on's to change the dynamics of how the game is played .They are all various costumes for the girls in the game .    The game could be summed up as this kill zombies move to next area kill boss get cut scene kill zombies move on to next area kill boss get cut scene and so on till you kill the final boss and get the final cut scene and the game ends . It also opens up an animated still and audio gallery .         I really can not advise anyone to spend almost $50 on a very short game that ' might work' No matter how much cartoon T and A it has .",

Not sure what that is about. Also got stuff for the gallery and the gallery didn't open up? Seems to have alot of issues. It's still fun to play anything with hot chicks fighting is cool and this is good enough but wait for a steam sale and don't pay full price for this hopefully they will update this more i got ver. 1.9 and it still has glitches i read about since 1.3 Over all it's ok",
