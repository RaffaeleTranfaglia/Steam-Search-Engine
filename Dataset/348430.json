            "review_text": "Bought the Quell trio bundle pack which I very much recommend. It's almost like meditating yet you're still gently using your brain with each puzzle set just a little more difficult or more interesting than the last set. And you can redo when you either have gotten yourself to a point where you can't win. Or you want to try again with less moves. And I'm a sucker for game controller support. This game absolutley does not need it. However, they provide it better than some action games I own! It's nice to not be tied to a keyboard but instead sit back and relax with the controller. Love the music. The game is interesting. Relaxing. Falls into the box of good-for-you brain games. You lose track of time. You don't feel frustrated when you're done. It's like being engrossed in a good book and after a bit you look up and realize your surroundings around you. You feel refreshed and recharged. And, again, relaxed yet challenged just a bit. No other game like this out there. Kudos to the developers for originality!",
