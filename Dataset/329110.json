            "review_text": "Gems of War is a match-3 game with RPG and card collecting elements. If you've enjoyed the Puzzle Quest games, then this one is up your alley. It's free to play and even with the Gold 'energy system', it's still a blast to play without having to spend a dime.     Your team consists of 4 members which is usually your hero and 3 other Troop cards.    Troops  can be earned from Iron Keys (random chance, 1000 gold, guild tasks) or Magic Keys (real money).   Troops level up by enchanting them with  Souls . Max level as of now is level 10.   Souls are gained by killing enemy Troops, completing Kingdom challenges, disenchanting duplicate Troop cards, PVP rewards, and guild tasks.    For every Kingdom quest line that you complete, you are awarded with the Epic card for that kingdom so no need to spend money on Magic Keys unless you really want a chance at those Legendaries.  Things will start out a bit slow since you only have 1 Kingdom and a basic team but hang in there. Once you unlock more kingdoms and join a guild, Iron Keys will become frequent and gold won't seem like a huge deal.  Read on for more tips on Gold and maximizing it.  WARNING  wall-o-text inc.  In Gems, Gold is used to initiate battles and unlock new kingdoms. Each unlocked kingdom will produce Gold for you if you complete up to a certain point in their quest lines, however, you can set one kingdom as your home kingdom to give you bonus gold and mana. Your home kingdom will produce for you 500 gold per 24 hours, or 525 gold if you completed the quest line for it.  If you log in once a day, you will receive a daily log in bonus. The bonus begins at 50 gold and then maxes out at 300 gold. The day resets at 7pm EST/6pm CST.  Gems also runs PVP events that will rotate every 2 weeks. So far, the events give you an additional 200 gold per day.  My recommendation is to join a guild. The guild will give you an initial daily gold bonus of 5% and of course, the percentage bonus will be higher the higher ranked the guild is.  This is what it looks like so far on a Day 7+ log in with one completed kingdom:    Home Kingdom: 525 gold    Day 7+ Daily Bonus: 300 gold   PVP Event: 200 gold   Guild Bonus (5% to daily): 25 gold    Total:  1050 gold / 24 hours for just logging in  Other ways to maximize Gold is to play smart. Matching 4 or 5-in-a-row will give you 4 gold and 5 gold respectively. If you are decent at match-3 games and setting up moves for those 4 &amp; 5-matches, you will seldom, if not never, run out of Gold. Out of my playtime on Gems, I have yet run out of Gold once.  There are also several Troop cards that give you Gold as their ability such as the Alchemist:   Alchemist   Transform a selected Mana color to Yellow. Gain [3+Magic] Gold.   At Level 10, he will give you 8 Gold and then you can choose a color to change to yellow and net yourself easy 4 or 5-in-a-row matches.  Tip: The maximum gold you can earn per battle from Troop skills and 4 &amp; 5-matches is  105 gold .  With Troops like the Alchemist, you can come out of a battle hitting the 105 gold cap easily. And when battles cost 50 gold - 80 gold, you've made profit every battle.  The biggest gold costs are unlocking kingdoms. It costs 250 gold to unlock your first kingdom and then every kingdom after that costs 250 gold extra (e.g. 500, 750, 1000, etc). There's really no way to lessen the blow so just save up :)",

And cards are quite upgradable (up to lvl 15) -Lots of great, short stories throughout the game. Quick plots (nothing too special) and awesome characters. -New cards come out roughly every 10 days that are fairly accessable. Special cards come out that require diamonds to be saved up or bought every month or so. -Having enough gold is not really an issue, despite other reports.  Cons: -No 'easy view' or battle chat, and is limited to one short sentence at a time... -No true PvP.  All in all: -Expect a normal, mini-transation Facebook MMO. But it's still quite playable free. 7.5/10",

Gems of War is a mixture of Puzzle Kingdom and Puzzle Quest by the original creator. I never spend any cent on this game, yet I am the 1 of the top 4th guild. This may sounds bad for the developer. If you pay money in this game, the only different is you get increased chance to get better monster than those who do not pay.  I don't have Legendary monster, but Rare monster are good enough.   In other puzzle RPG like Tower Of Savior and Puzzle &amp; Dragon, enemies attack you with multiple turn 'CD'. But in this game, everyone is playing a same rule.  Most important is monster synergy and color.   Rememeber how you play PQ1 by customizing skillset with balance mana? It is here. The only thing that lack from PQ1 is crafting/mount/puzzle mode but it is irrelevent in 'Gems Of War'  Fans of Puzzle RPG. It is time to rejoice.",

The developers have made the game so you can buy with crystals if you are patient everything. Also I have obtained 2 legendaries from silver keys and a joining a guild after level 25 is worth your time as the people donate more gold and you usually get at least 18 silver keys and 30 crystals each week. The game is progression based and you can earn higher level cards by farming souls such as using the valkyre and brian the lucky cards together (60 souls cap per battle).  I do prefer this free to play style game where waiting will get you everything slowly vs other companies using a clear abuse of paying to win tactic you can never obtain paid content/rewards - these games I refuse to play. I will always donate some money for the developers as they are fairer than other companies. I play divination fields challenge 1 over and over to progress now i have finished all the stories. This game can be linked to your phone so you can play in your lunch break or even walking or to relax. I have never run out of gold and PVP rank does not drop if you lose matches so you do not go backwards. Thumbs up from me for a fun Gem match RPG game and other puzzle quest games.",

(You can link your account on Steam to portable device or vice versa, not having to play 2 different games)  As all free games they need to get money from somewhere, in this case as in all other games..a shop to buy crap in. I still havent bought anything in that shop..nor will i ever..can't really see the need to. (possibly will, to support further development of the game though) Most fun is that most of the negative reviews have hundreds of gamehours,,but still they won't recomend it ^^ That's like eating the Pizza AND the box it came in and then tell everyone how bad the Pizza was. *nom nom nom* So obviously the game is a bit fun,,even if it's bad ;)  Nah...download the game..try it..

And quite a lot is built around that core to make the experience diverse and entertaining for hours.  Just try it. Personally, I was quite surprised that I ended up to like it that much.   And a side note regarding PvP critics in the recent reviews.  Yes, you play vs AI but you still compete against real person's team composition and progression/level.  Using AI have benefits of instant and fast paced(but without turn time limits for you) matches.  I don't think providing a real opponent would add much for a game with half-casual mechanic. This is not MtG/Hearthstone. ",

It is a free to play with an energy sytem in the form of gold, so if you want to play more than 45 min a pop and unlock new packs of cards at a quick rate be prepared to pay. I have not tried too much pvp, but I can imagene that if you wanted to get up high in the ranks it will cost you some real world money. I can forsee hitting a wall where it could stop being fun once I have completed the story quests and their challanges, since they are not repetable, but until then it should be some good old match 3 fun,  Edit: Tried PVP, and I have not ran into any limitations by my not playing money. Playing PVP you get more gold than you spend per round, so you could play till your eyes bled without having to worry about running out of gold. The Devs plan weekly or by weekly events to keep things fresh, so I do not think I will run out of content any time soon.",

            "review_text": "Gems of War is a strategy based game, with plenty to do.  The main objective of the game is to match gems to attack oponents (CG or PVP) however there is more to do than this, which is what I find sets it apart from almost all other similar style games.   There are specialities, which focus on which gems give extra mana (which allows you to use special moves quicker) You can also gain souls, which are used to level up your characters. With hundreds, if not thousands of different characters with different abilities and majoring in different gem colours, there are so many combinations to create to make your team all-powerful.   Guilds are also an increasing important role (ahem, mines is 'WARMACHIN3'). Guild participation allows for additional keys for treasure chests (these give characters, as well as other cool stuff), gold (this helps progress to other areas), souls (help with levelling characters), diamonds (good for buying new armour)and maps (allow you to gain extra loot)  In order to go into every detail of the game I would be writing for a long time, there is plenty to do and hold your interest. The only downside I've seen is that it kind of throws you in, and you need to discover a lot yourself, but that's not major as it's pretty easy to get the hang of it. I've been playing aound 50 hours and I'm nowhere near close to halfway through. In my opinion it's well worth the time and effort, and has quickly become one of my favourite games.",

            "review_text": "TL;DR version: Hesitant yes, if you're an intelligent player that paces their games. A no if you're a one-sitting gorger.  As far as a game goes, I find it a nice and interesting take on the Puzzle Quest concept. The art is clean, the mechanics are smooth, and things are for the most part labeled as they should. It's still a question of how much mana of a color you need for a certain card, but considering it's fairly recently come out it's not that big of a gripe though.  In regards to the reviews of 'Getting stuck after 4 hours' because of coins and souls, I have to say this: There's more to this game than the storyline.  In regards to coins: Yes, you only get 500/day, and battles do cost 50-60 coins apiece, but this is to try to help you limit your playtime. You're not supposed to gorge on video games for 12+ hours at a time. The game does seem to be formatted like a mobile game, and one of the logos on the title splash IS a mobile department. So the micropayments for additional playtime/content seems normal, yet I haven't spent a dime on the game and am having fun.  In regards to souls: Don't hoard cards. Look through what you have, chuck the crap for souls. Along with this, also do Challenges. Broken Spire's Stone Wall and Fortress Siege can be done really easy with a lot of cheese tactics, and they give large amounts of souls for completing them. So it'd be a win-win, no?  The one gripe I have, and is starting to become a wall for me, is the RNG in the game. Far far far FAR too often will gems fall perfectly for the AI to combo off of (since 4+ strings give an extra turn), or will drop down skulls at the perfect placement for them to push them into damage. It's almost too coincidental, and feels more like fluff difficulty than an actual challenge, which without this luck of the draw for the AI, would be a general pushover.",

Early game is a bit rocky but once you get going, there is meaningful experience through the early-mid, mid, and early-late game in both PvP and other modes.   Don't like PvP? Don't worry, Gems uses an AI to control player-made teams that you can set to defend for you and go against whenever you please. Gems is fairly well balanced, with a couple VERY powerful troop combinations, but it is possible to make anything viable for as far in as I have played.   Would I recommend this game? Hell yes. And I have, and I've gotten several friends playing now as well and they love it, too. So jump on in and give it a try. It's free, so the only thing you stand to lose if you don't love it is a bit of your time.  Oh, and as a final note, the developers are incredibly awesome and come on from time to time to talk with the players. They take feedback into consideration and have a fairly transparent design process and are open to discuss anything from in-game topics to daily life with anyone.

            "review_text": "This was my original review of this game, and I had recommended it to others: 'Fun game--great to relax to. No need to buy extras unless you really want to. In early play in the game it costs more to play than you 'earn' by winning, but play through and soon earning plenty to play and get extras.'  Now, I no longer recommend this game to others, and although I still play some, I am very close to quitting. Here are just a few of my thoughts:  So far, I do not like anything about this new update. The previous update was a degradation of the game, but this one has taken the game to a point where I feel like I am 'slogging through' an unpleasant experience rather than enjoying an engaging fun game. When I started playing the game it was relatively easy to understand the play and logic, and it was a nice way to relax after a day of work. It took some thought and strategizing to improve your game, building teams for different purposes and using them to advantage under differing circumstances. Leveling up is now too complicated, and even the 'buying' rewards with earned glory or gems, etc, has now essentially become so complcated or expensive (seemingly targeted at the pay to play audience), I no longer have incentive to play enough to 'earn' enough to buy a reward of armour, additional character or new weapon.  Now everything that was relaxing and casual (and fun) about the game has been taken away or changed. I have previously recommended this game to others, however, do not believe will do so again. The last update seemed geared towards smart phone or tablet users, and the appearance of the cards/characters changed significantly. Most of the character/card appearance updates were not positive.   Please bring back the original game as it was--roll back to a couple of updates ago and release it as a 'version 1' or 'classic'. I did like the addition of new kingdoms, rewards, arena, and maps. It would have been better to have rolled out a different version ('gold' or 'championship' or even as simple as 'gems of war 2') to make these changes, rather than so drastically altering the play of what had been a very fun, enjoyable and relaxing game.",

            "review_text": "The longer Gems of War is played, the more it cheats. Not the actual A.I. routines mind you, but the gem drops. At first the drops are manipulated to slightly benefit new players, but as you rank up they heavily favor the A.I. opponents.  If this wasn't a 'free to play' game searching for 'whales', it probably would have been better balanced and satisfying. Even though I'll continue to play, I won't encourage this kind of phone/tablet philosophy with 'micro transactions'. The developers should design a better game and charge a reasonable price. I recommend Puzzle Quest 1, since it's still the best game from this sub-genre (match 3 RPG) I've ever played.  Edit-  While my comments were accurate at the time of my initial review, I feel that the obvious 'cheating' mentioned above had been addressed awhile ago. This is not a deep game, but I keep playing.",

It's a very intriguing mix between a basic match-3 combo game and a card game, where you create your own team.  I want to highlight what I like about Gems of War:     Lots of different units with unique spells and attack moves make for endless team constellations that you can try out.    You don't to spend real money  at all . Simply because you don't need the cash items to enjoy the game and moreover there is a way to get small amounts of cash currency in the game, so you can save up.    The unit design is beautiful. All kinds of fantasy creatures and heroes - check it out.    There are many things to do and you can create a guild with your friends and work on goals together.    It's very good if you only have small time windows for some casual playing - you can easily play 1-2 rounds and make progress in 10-15 minutes without having to invest hours at once.    The new update brought plenty of new features including harder difficulties for extra challenging gameplay.   Big fat recommendation!  10/10 ",

This is NOT true. You can easily get a good unit from the free key drops and if you think about how to put your best line-up out there you can definately beat someone with 3 legendary troops. I spent a lot of time just winning P2P with a common troop (goblin) in my line-up. 2- You can only play 10 minutes a day because you run out of gold to pay for your battles. Also NOT true. Just win some matches at P2P and gain enough gold to keep playing for as long as you'd llike.  Highly reccommended game, IMHO.",

My advice? Don't buy keys, you can earn them just by matching those gems.   Defend you kingdom does gain gold, it cost you 50 gold to get around 30~60 gold, easy money. By the way you can get EPIC cards , i repeat EPIC CARDS just by unlock the kingdom and finish all it quest. By finish all the challenge you can earn 100 souls, enough to upgrade the hell out og your troop up to max Level. Thsoe challenge are nothing, it super easy.  For those who said this game not good, I feel sad for them. It a good game for great mind. Just don't play it when you have a bad day. You might fall in a losing chain instead of winning chain. It like playing chess, you move one gem wrong , you dead.  After 45 hours of playing I now have a great deck without paying any real money.

I recently decided to switch around my teams and went from a team with attack power over 4,000 to one under 3,000, but was doing better just because the team worked better together.  You can join a guild which allows you to connect with other players, but also to increase your daily earnings. The other thing that keeps it fresh for me, is if I ever get bored of battling, I can just relax and play a treasure map which is all about making big matches to earn gold, glory, keys, and traitstones.

No matter what you do, how many guilds you join, how often you allow them to post to your Facebook page, or how many dollars you throw at this game to embellish your troops or your main character, once you reach the advanced level of the game, you will not win. Gems of War doesn't want to challenge you. It wants to make you angry, and at that it truly succeeds.  Play this game long enough and you'll see for yourself: at a certain point, the AI literally takes control of the match and gives itself 6 turns in a row to your every 1. Super powered monsters come out of their respective lairs and blow your characters to smithereens leaving you sitting there slack jawed and stunned, with nothing to show for your efforts. Blatantly rigging a game in this manner is audacious and mean spirited, not to mention just plain stupid. There's not even any attempt to make it appear as though you lost the match fair and square.

This game is predicated on two extremely broken concepts:  1. The person who moves first in this game (which is you) has an overwhelming advantage in a short game. 2. The AI is overwhelmingly stronger than most players in a long game.  So you start your game and you're easily able to leverage your first move advantage and beating the AI down easily, and you think this is a fair game for a F2P or that you're just so awesome at this game. Then, eventually the game gets longer as AI comes with more complete teams + higher level teams with HP values your team can't touch. Since the AI pretty much never evaluates a match 4/5 or a skull situation wrong, eventually you're going to make a bad move and watch the AI merciless pound your guys to oblivion. Now this is where most reviews will claim the game is P2W or the AI is cheating. But it's not that. Even if you spent hundreds of dollars on the game your slightly stronger team will still get pounded horribly whenever you make a mistake, but if you got enough money on your guys you might be able to withstand the barrage. Of course, for those who aren't big spenders you'll simply lose and run out of your gold. You can try again or grind some more but overall it doesn't change the fact that as games drag on, you'll simply be beaten by AI's flawless evaluation of the key scenarios, and evaluating those scenarios correctly determines the winner about 90% of the time.  Of course, the lack of information on your cards from an in game source makes any attempt to put together a team a wild guess at best. There are skills that reads like 'does 2 + damage based on number of reds'. How much damage? You don't know unless you check a forum for a guy who has worked out the math. So you face a significant deficit and you don't even necessarily know how your skills will work. Can you expect this guy to be able to tank or that guy to be able to do damage at level 10? Better check a guide elsewhere, because this information isn't available in the game short of leveling the character up yourself, and there's no way you can afford to do that just as an experiment.  I suspect if you spent enough time/money on the game you'll eventually reach some kind of equilibrium where you have enough high level characters with enough cheap skills to reduce the average game to a length short enough to be even, but I don't know why anyone should be expected to put up with the abuse on the way getting there. The game by design is meant to hurt and I guess you win when you can overcome the beating. Or you can just not play the game.",

But, for every won fight you get... around 10 gold. After a few fights my character didn't have anymore gold and I had to stop playing. Ofcourse, game provides player with daily gold but it amount is as low as for the won fight. So, basiclly, if you want to play more that 3 games a day you are forced to buy in game gold for real money.  Also, the pvp matching is horribly unbalanced. My character, below lvl 10, was matched against characters over 30 lvl. Pvp also cost gold fee for entering, which is way bigger that normal fight and if you loose... you loose almost all your gold.  The game itself IS nice and fun.

            "review_text": "Guys avoid this game like the plague the AI is rigged, its like playing against a supercomputer as soon as you go past lvl 15 the AI will chain combo you endlessly its almost impossible to beat him. The game dev have done this on purpose to tempt free players to buy gems, avoid this game you won't regret it. Its a shame ps4 allows these type of developers on their platform.  Its just not the AI the issue, i will explain : things such as new line gems appearing and which give the AI perfect chain combos i mean i am talking about 5x combo chained automatically when the new row falls down this is the best part the AI did not have to even do anything the game gave him free combos. The dev claims its 50/50 when several players have discovered the same things , the game has an edge of the player at all times. I wouldn't mind if the AI being smart but when the game mechanics includes the other elements i have mentionned you not even fair ground match, its like playing poker and your opponents keeps having royal flush or straight flush.",
