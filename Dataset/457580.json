To show them how the Oculus Rift or HTC Vive can draw on your fear just as well as reality can. I told my friends that if they wanted to try my Rift for real, they would have to play through this game, lasting roughly 10 minutes, as a test of their dedication to try virtual reality xD  Needless to say, I sat and tried to hold in my laugh as they played through the game, knowing what was about to come. A few of them even refused to continue playing half-way through the game, so they failed their test. For 1€, this game is worth it all, especially because of the EXTREMELY scary atmosphere in the game!",

Had a friend try it and it suddenly decided not to work correctly with models beginning to just twitch randomly and with odd shadows but I won't judge the game for this since it and the very least worked once. I'll just say that this isn't scary, that's the only reason I wouldn't recommend it as it is fairly boring and could only be scary if you never experienced horror before. One way or another $1 seems worth it but I would recommend 'Emily wants to Play' if you want something with a more involved horror experience.",

My final and successful attempt was accomplished by leaning against my wall so the chaperone field was activated - thus keeping the ghosts out with my awesome pretend Faraday cage.  It's short - you can't do anything - and it's got some jump scares, but this has what many games lack - terror.  Give the guy a dollar. Let him make something grand with it.",

My youngest wanted to give it a shot and stayed in for about a minute before he decided it was too intense. My wife tried it a little later, having missed my initial run, and the kids and I had a blast watching mom. She even picked up on a few things that I missed on my first go so I'll have to try it again. This is a good fun demo for the 99 cent price tag. I'm looking forward to the next project. Thanks..",

To stay constructive: There is way to much time between the different events, and the buzzing, flickering lamps are annoying and take to much from the atmosphere.  I would have been happy if the events were triggered by looking to specific locations. And only if the player is not doing what you need him to do or is totally lost, use the light flickers as a last resort of a hint.  ",
