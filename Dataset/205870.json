            "review_text": "I played this game long, long ago, on the suggestion of Tycho from Penny Arcade. I played through all the demo levels in one sitting. When the finished game became available, I bought it.  And then, like so many rereleases on steam, I bought it again.  Auditorium is one of the best chill out games. It's a puzzler that can tax you intellectually, but still manage to feel fair and grounded in a consistent set of rules.   Ever played Orbient? It's a game in Nintendo's Art Style series, featuring gameplay that revolves around(excuse the pun) planetary orbits and gravity wells, singularities and the resulting trajectories of moving from one gravitational influence to another.   Auditorium quickly becomes the cousin to Orbient; At its best, ontrolling the path of the flowing lines across the screen becomes an entrancing kind of interstellar dance, with objects that attract or repel the flowing trajectories of sound. You create your own little solar system of music. Those moments? Sublime.",

I usually don't like puzzle games because they're mostly stressful and I feel like there's no reason to complete it level-by-level; this is one of the first ones where I actually wanted to progress further, and didn't want to stop. Really creative and unlike anything I've played before. The trailer sold me and playing it is more fun than I expected.",

            "review_text": "Auditorium is a game based around some very simple mechanics that affect how various colored particles move and change color. The game consists of 15 levels of 4-5 stages each. Each stage requires the player to direct particles of specific colors toward each 'container' or sensor. Each sensor is associated with one color (or more, in later levels), and the player must find a way to fill the bars of all sensors on the stage at the same time.  Despite the straightforward mechanics of the game, the difficulty of the puzzles lies in the ways the different mechanics interact; it's easy enough to get one stream of particles to go towards one sensor, but when you're dealing with 2 streams, 5 sensors (several of which are multi-color), and a black hole, and you only have a few items to work with, things can get a little tricky. These complex interactions can be a little unpredictable, so later levels may involve a lot of trial and error - even if you look up a solution online, being a few pixels off can throw a wrench into the works.  Despite ostensibly being a game heavily involving music, the soundtrack is not that great. All the stages consist of short repeating loops of music; each sensor, when filled, causes one element or instrument of the music for that level to play. When the stage is completed, the screen changes to indicate this as the music continues to play. Because the music consists of short loops, however, even the best music gets old quickly.  This game is probably best played in short bursts. I decided to sit down and beat most of the game today (I'd probably finished the first two levels years ago), and just finished it. Overall, Auditorium is more of a webtoy than a proper game, but it's still quite enjoyable and challenging for what it is. There's probably not much replay value once you beat it; though theoretically you could mess around and find alternate solutions for each stage, there's no real motivation to do so. I would probably not have paid full-price for the game, but I would recommend checking it out if it's on sale. Plus, you can always check out the demo online first if you're unsure about buying.",

(at least not yet) No tutorial at all, and no hand holding, but simple enough to pick up on your own, and they start you off slow. They add new control elements every few levels so there not enough time to get bored. Very happy I got this game.   Not everyone will like the simplicity, but I love finding something a little outside the box that was obviously well designed.",
