It’s fun and all BUT ….It’s broken and it seems as if the development team has absolutely no intentions on fixing any of its issues. For the first week or so it was out on steam the developer was active with the community, but once they made sales.. poof, best magic show disappearing act ever! Check out the HUGE Bug Reports discussion in the games Community Hub, if you glance it over you can see the developer say he will look at them all 'over the weekend' them come back and say he was too busy to look at them. That was.. over 50 days ago as of this review… still no word on fixes.  I don't think I will ever trust Hammer Labs with my money ever again, Its clear that they are only out to make a quick buck then move on to the next thing, there is no care to if the product actually functions or not.",

            "review_text": "Fantastic little game for what I paid for it.  I completed the entire story mode in roughly 10 hours. I definitely feel like i can cut that time in half now that I know what to do and how to do it all in the game. Very little in the game is explained unfortunately, but it doesn't ruin too much of the experience as you can always google some of the answers. More than half of the achievements don't get unlocked for some reason, but who cares about that. There are some very minor detailing issues which could have been fixed but instead were overlooked, again, nothing worth complaining about though. Character customization feels a little bit weak and everything available in the customization minus hats and glasses, you see in the game on NPCs, but at least you have some customizing options which is nice. The game is much better played using the keyboard to move the map around cuz side scrolling gets irritating as the GUI prevents the scrolling. The some of the recipes training is annoyingly difficult to get 3 stars (fastest cook time) but at least once you get the stars, it's permanent unless you get even more stars, and 1 star is simple and easy to get... just take your time and get it done. The helpers do a pretty good job with the restaurant and farm, but there are still things they cannot do, like cut grass, milk the cows, make the deal with the customers, and they sometimes glitch in an annoying way where they pick up and drop something about a dozen times while they wait for more work, they also put the basket down in weird places making you have to search for them every time you want to use them. Since I muted the music cuz I tend to play for many hours at a time and music usually becomes repetitive and annoying (no idea if this one's any good though), the game ends up really lacking in sound effects... like when I throw the potion at zombies, no sound, you never hear birds and wild life in the background, etc... still not game breaking though. In this game, there is always too much to do and never enough time to do it which really keeps your mind sucked into the game trying to rush into everything and you can easily spend several hours into the game without even realizing it. The ending of the game was a little disappointing and too simplified as you basically cure the old man and he thanks you in a bubble text and the end credits appear. Also, the game froze after the end credits during loading (at 86%), probably bringing me back to game menu? Other than that, the game is very stable, plays fine on my gaming rig without having to hack the game apart in order to force it to work like some EA and Rockstar games out there...  I definitely recommend this game to anyone who is into farming and time consuming games. Zombies are optional as you can disable them. Endless mode is also available if you prefer to play without an ending. I didn't play the game for the story and neither will you, but the gameplay by itself is definitely worth the money. I would suggest waiting for a sale though as I doubt those minor issues mentioned will ever be fixed and the way I see it, 'why hand a developer 100% of the money when he only delivered 90% of the game?'",

Before I knew it, it was 4 in the morining and I hadn't left my computer for hours!  I'm not usually into casual games, or even games in this style.genre, but I thought this was really fun. There's quite a few directions you can go while playing/farming and that allows you to learn and play again with a better plan. Really fun, totally worth it on sale!",

Farm for your Life was a fun alternative and with added features (like Zombies!) I found myself to have a lot of fun playing it!  If you like growing things, farming, or gardening in games I would definitely recommend this game for you!",

            "review_text": "First, let me say that I don't recommend this game NOT because it is a bad game; it's just that there isn't much to it. It's a bit too easy (it took me very little time to beat it - less than 10 hrs).  Not bad for a short-term time waster, and it's even kind of cute, but honestly I'd recommend playing something else as the playability is short-lived and the replay value just really doesn't exist. It's kind of like Farmville meets Diner Dash; plant a crop once, harvest that square repeatedly over time to get the ingredients for your restaurant, occasionally fertilize, don't forget to buy sprinklers. You throw crops at the zombies to make them disappear, occasionally you venture into the 'forest' to get some needed tool, and the money you make from your restaurant gets used to buy more 'farming' items (seeds, cows, chickens, etc). That's pretty much all there is to it, in a nutshell.",

Farm, harvest, cook, look for resources, and set up a few defenses to stop the zombies. Not much more to do.  Pros:  Easy to play. No learning curve. Graphics are bright, very geared for younger gamers. Its cheap, but i would still buy it on a sale.  Cons: Its geared for younger gamers. The control response is shockingly annoying Story mode is about six hours, it does allow you to play on afterwards, but... After story mode your only real objective is to find the golden tools. The zombies don't hurt you, but they take your resources.  Overall, it feels like Sesame Street helped develop it. Only kept my attention for a few minutes at a time. Dont get me wrong, it really had a lot of potential, they just gave up. Only reason i played for so long was because Playfire payed me.  Who wants it? People that like farming sims, kids, or the really casual gamer looking for a few minutes to kill. I recommend it simply because of the effort put in to it, and the ease for which a child can play it ",

It wasn't that long of a game and while the idea behind the story is great there isn't enough dialogue to make you feel for any characters so I just kind of grinded through the game purely because I wanted to win. The gameplay is AWESOME, the mix of diner dash, harvest moon, plants verses zombies, and fruit ninja is HILARIOUS. I will probably be playing this again for sure, and perhaps try the endless mode. WARNING if you're looking for something challenging and or difficult this game is not for you, unless you intentionally make it harder for yourself because the game gives you tons of helping hands and machines to deal with the work around the farm.",
