            "review_text": "System Shock 2 (which  doesn't  expect you to have played the previous installment) is a survival-horror first-person-shooter with role-playing elements, and is regarded by many as one of the all-time classics -- and deservedly so.  The game takes place within the cold metal walls of the FTL-capable spacecraft 'Von Braun', and its piggy-backing sister ship, the 'Richenbacker' -- which, handily, needs a capable grunt to help keep it safe. After a few short (and, thankfully, optional) tutorial VR simulations, you chose one of three 'classes': a gun-wielding Marine, a psi-power controlling Psi-Op (otherwise known as a wizard!), or the middle-of-the-two Navy -- and are then dutifully assigned to the Von Braun on its and humanity's maiden faster-than-light voyage. Put into cyrogenic sleep until needed, you are rudely awakened to find your memory erased and the ship seemingly empty, barring a Doctor Janice Polito who offers you help over your communicator. You quickly find that a force of seemingly alien beings have taken control of the ship and its system-controlling AI (along with a fair amount of the on-board monkey population!), as you and Polito form an alliance to try and regain control of the ship...or at the very least re-enable the needed systems to call for help.  The game plot initially focuses on your player-character receiving orders from Pollotio, who's quite handily barricaded in her room on the Operations deck. With a primary objective of attempting to reach her and call for help/escape, she keeps you updated with any objectives that need to be fulfilled to gain access to further areas of the ship and slow down the advance of the enemy where possible. I say 'initially focuses on' as things soon change, and, without spoiling anything, System Shock 2 will spin the story on its head -- and treat you to one of the most wonderfully constructed plot-twists in gaming history (well, it had more of a  kick  in 1999, anyway). It isn't ground-breaking story-wise, but it's exceptionally executed, and has left an impression on everyone who's ever played it; Ken Levine certainly engrossed right from the beginning.  The Von Braun itself is split into several different sections, each deck providing a different function for the on-board science crew, and each providing you a different type of environment to explore; from the cramped and radioactive engineering deck to the more open shopping and recreational deck, each section feels individual -- although all of the decks feel as cold and oppressive as you'd imagine a floating tin-can to be. Make no mistake though, the game is quite linear: objectives rarely span more than one deck, allowing you to constantly pursue and explore new and interesting areas -- however you may wish to back-track across previously-visited decks to research artifacts and weapons which will provide you with bonuses for later on.  While there are a few survivors dotted around, you never really interact with them; most of the plot is advanced through either the environment, with words written in blood covering the walls -- or through voice-logs and emails of the recently dead, much like in the game's spiritual successor, Bioshock. You're never taken out of the game; you're always in first-person perspective, and always quite alone...with mainly just the voices of the dead to keep you company!  System Shock 2 isn't all roses though, especially with age. Games have moved on quite a bit, and without nostalgia to help ignore the flaws, new-comers might find the low-polygon creatures a little cartoonish, the graphics a little underwhelming, and generally just lacking the kind of polish you find nowadays. The game-play itself requires a more cautious-than-usual approach too -- not quite as cautious as the Thief series, but not quite as guns-blazing as most first person shooters -- which may put some off.  If you're not afraid of rough edges and want to experience one of gaming's classic playgrounds, black out your room, slip on some surround-sound headphones, and  enjoy .",

And I don't regret it. The comparisons between this and BioShock are pretty much spot on, but I must say that this game seems like a more complex version of BioShock; a great thing, in my opinion.  The gameplay is pretty varied, from the number of different weapons you can get, to the psionic abilities. The RPG aspects are pretty good as well, allowing you to customize your character according to your playstyle. The weapons get damaged over time, which means that you must perform maintenance on them periodically, otherwise they'll end up breaking (you can still repair them, though). The hacking mechanic is good, and the research function, which sometimes requires you to find the appropriate elements for your research is excellent.  As far as environments go, you can go almost anywhere. You can return to earlier sections of the ship to look for stuff you left there, and all the different decks have their unique style. There's a good variety of enemies, each with their own weaknesses and strength, which you can learn about by researching their organs after you kill them. It also has a good soundtrack, and the story, without spoilers, is excellent.  I really recommend this game, especially if you enjoyed the original BioShock.",

            "review_text": "(Disclaimer: I've spent much more time in SyS 2 but outside of Steam). Beforehand: I'm as far into the game that I just have to share my thoughts with you. I started with the vanilla version but I spent most of the time with a modded version (community patch, various texture and graphical mods). So my experience is mostly based on a patched up SyS 2. As many others, I knew Bioshock before I've heard of SyS 2. I was aware that Bioshock was heavily influenced by Sys 2, the one can be seen as the spiritual successor or the other way round SyS 2 as the predecessor. Some say that SyS 2 is the better game and I was sceptical about that because of the game's age and Bioshock's quality. Well, it's a matter of taste and I won't debate it here.  (Let's finally start with the review at this point.) However what SyS 2 delivers is downright beautiful. I actually turned the new NPC models (mod) off because the original ones with high poly scare the pie out of me. This refers to my first point: -Atmosphere- The setting presented is executed in a brilliant way. Music (ambient one, not the DnB/Techno - at least for my taste) and surrounding are intertwined beautifully. Additionaly the mechanics and gameplay add to the hostile feeling and environment because you're constantly short on supplies. You are worried about every next step. This again meets with the urge to explore. The game does it right, because not only you want to explore, you also have to because of the supply shortage. And you don't feel forced to as well as you will get rewarded for your curiosity without making the game predictable. I forgot to mention the customization which goes far deeper than in e.g. Bioshock. Your character can be developed in innumerous ways - not only in terms of common classes. In sum classes and specialization are very 'fluid'. Everything makes sense in-game - it isn't just there, so you can do it but it's thought through. The way this game makes you making choices is just hard to be matched. -Realism- Some people classify this game as a 'sim fpsrpg' and that for a reason. E.g. every weapon wears off. You can maintain, repair and modify objects. Certain weapons work on certain enemies etc. You have to know and can research your enemies weaknesses. It boils down to stats eventually but also on how you approach every single situation. Gunplay (if focused by your way of playing) itself isn't very satisfying but it serves its purpose.  -AI- Well the AI has aged but it has implemented the stages of awareness you might know of the Thief titles - being suspicious, alerted, etc. It may be clunky but pathfinding works good and it strangely fits the game. It is bone-hard to beat anyway, and the AI makes it even scarier.  Some final words: Of course the game has faced enough criticism as well for being clunky and overly complex but I guess the community patches have brought some extra balance and smoothed out the rough edges (graphically and figuratevly speaking). And the mod manager let's you turn mods on and off (!) in a matter of seconds which is a big advantage compared to dumb copy and paste of modded directories. Simply put, the (modding) community is great - also thanks to Looking Glass Studios. Ad Backtracking criticism: I don't consider this as a problem. As aforementioned - it makes sense and is part of the realism. Furthermore it adds to reduce linearity so often seen in games and it rewards players who can memorise stuff. Final words: SyS 2 reminds you of what a game can be and what a game can and should do right. I recommend it to everyone and plead for some patience of those who feel e.g. overwhelmed at first.  Yours, B.",

Setting the flag for the survival horror schifi rpg genre, SS2 is a game lots will enjoy, and few can handle without any help from walkthroughs and maybe cheats as well.  Find yourself alone in a ship far away into the dead space in the middle of a chaotic hostile and evil environment. Choose your skills well. Your moves even better. Trust the machine. Scavenge. Hack. Kill. Survive.  The game is scary, creepy, spooky (insert more synonyms here) and good god it's so hard.

The story is simple but nice and has some surprises.  The best of the game is the atmosphere for me! The most I liked is the cool voice editing I guess. Regulary you hear some voices in your head and these are edited quite good. The creepiness comes along with scary monsters and creepy voices. The monsters respawn randomly so you actually can never cool down. Additionally, you are alone all over.  The RPG part consists of a skill system. So you can hack consolses and more but you have to have the knowledge for example. Moreover, there's a research system and for some objects you have to find chemicals. I really like that idea.  Altough System Shock 2 is from 1999 it's great. It's a classic game. I really like old games. You too? Then don't wait to buy this game it's really worth it!",

It's atmosphere, level design, visual design and level of depth in its rpg mechanics is why i love this game. Great techno music during combat, great writing and a fun and creepy story.  It's still an amazing game i just think that most gamers are spoiled with the hand holding in modern games and they will never be able to get into this kind of game and experience it which is sad. You have to figure out what you have to do and where you have to go by yourself. There is no magic waypoint all the time telling you where you need to go. You have to read logs to find codes for doors to progress and research specific items needed to progress using different chemicals that you have to find in the levels. You have to carefully manage your inventory and supplies throughout the whole game or you won't be able to progress. The game forces you to use your brain and you get a great sense of accomplishment when you complete a stage you have been on for hours (engineering).  This game also rewards you very nicely for exploring every area of the game with items which encourages taking your time and exploring every area of the ship. This game has some of the best sound design of all time with the voice of shodan and the sounds of the ship and the music and sound effects etc. It's still honestly one of the best games ever made i would put it somewhere in my top 20 i can't really think of anything i dislike about it.  10/10 (Masterpiece)",

            "review_text": "Ah man, where do I start with this game. This game is one of the greatest computer games I have ever played. From the creators of Thief, and it’s just as good. Anyway, let’s get into this. DISCLAIMER: This review will include some forms of spoilers  Gameplay- The gameplay is very nice; very easy to get into. Admittingly the two different forms of HUD were a little funky at first, but I quickly got use to it, and I enjoyed running in one direction away from Hybrids while trying to reload my gun with a different set of bullets. The “Cyber Modules” system was also good. Using Cyber Modules you can upgrade the player’s Stats, Weapons Skills, Psi Powers, and Tech. At the start of the game it’s easy to get into upgrading your character with the different Cyber Modules you are given or pick up throughout the Von Braun, and then as the game goes on Upgrades start costing more and more Cyber Modules to the point where each Cyber Module you receive is like the greatest thing ever, and that my friends, is how you do a Upgrade system. I never actually got into the Psi Powers, so I can’t say much on that, but of what I did it was pretty cool and snazzy.  Graphics- The game was made in 1999 for Computers… So that should say something about the graphics. But the graphics aren’t horrid, they’re easy to look at, but it actually took the “Horror” aspect of the game down a bit because of how laughable some of the enemies look. There are some mods are textures you can download however to increase the quality of the textures, and those do look good so I would recommend them.  Setting- As I mentioned above, the game is “Horror”. However, it is much more than just a Horror game(and as I mentioned before the graphics make it not all that scary). In the first few parts of the game you’ll come across the occasional severed limb or head. But as the game goes on they start appearing less and less until they’re just gone for good almost. In my opinion that shows that the developers weren’t trying to make a full out Horror game (of the Hollywood variety anyway). There are also a couple dead bodies hanging from the ceiling with horrific face expressions, but I only find like three of those. The main enemies in the game are Hybrids, which look like humans with a worm coming out of their chest biting onto their head, but really, it’s not all that scary. Now that I’ve covered the Horror parts of the game, it’s time to talk about how the game isn’t actually a “Horror” game. As I said before there is so much more to the game. It is definitely a Suspense game, and that it does perfectly. The game depends on the mysteries and suspense to creep you out rather than gore, which is great for the game. There are also the many Audio-logs left by the dead crew members. Many of these Logs help flesh out the history of the ship and it’s inhabitants, and all that happens before the start of the game. Some of the Logs you’ll wish you never read… Ehehehehe *Spoilerriffic stuffs start here* SHODAN is also a very important point of the game. Starting from her reveal up to the end of the game the game is at it’s best, with her constantly talking to you and prodding you along in her distorted yet adorable(I kid) voice. SHODAN’s interactions with the player are some of the best parts of the game: “I AM SHODAN”, “I-I-Insect!”, “Can’t you do anything right?!”  I was actually pretty disappointed when she betrayed me, I thought me and her had something, D: *End* VERDICT- This game is great, but probably not for everyone. If you are a fan of darker games or just want to play a game that’ll scare you(DARN ROBOTS!) but not give you nightmares, play this. Also I recommend this to fans of the “Thief” series, as it is made by the same studio and shares many voices(Stephen Russel, FTW!). This game took “Sci-Fi Horror” and made something great. I would really like to see a third game someday… *looks off into the sunset* Anyway, 8.5/10! It’s a great game! ALSO: I highly recommend listening to Cryoshell’s Breakout while playing the game!

There’s a strong storyline backed by first-rate voice acting. The combat is okay given the game’s age, and the RPG elements are convincing. Personally, I’m not a fan of weapon degradation and repair (thankfully dropped in the Bioshock games) but otherwise the gameplay design is very good.

I was pretty much, hoping for the author to pop out all of the sudden and say 'I plan to update this game completly, everyone who bought System Shock 2 Will get a free copy of the new updated game System Shock 3 :)' But that didn't happen, Oh well, at least we have you system shock 2. The game itself is good, if you know what to do and how to do it, if you don't know what to do or where to go, then you might as well be trying to eat pie without your mouth. I really enjoy it, and i was suprised on how good the game was considering the fact it was made, a while back, not only that but i was also suprised on how smoothly it ran throught the whole time i was playing, perhaps it got scared of the old graphics. I would recommend this game to the people that are open minded when it comes to old games, don't mind playing old video games, and people who like scare's now and then. Would not recommend to people whom Dislike horror games, outdated graphics and plots, ect ect. Other than that I would rate 11/10 Cats.",

The game takes place on the worlds first star ship 'The Van Braun', unfortunately, the ship has been taken over by an hybrid force known as 'The Many', you would then have to explore and do certain task to reach your main objective. The level design is great the graphics are not great but you could download mods to optimize your graphics. There is something called 'fan missions', fan missions are levels that you could download off of websites, fan missions are my favorite part about system shock 2 because you could create your own custom levels and the fan missions you could get are VERY fun! The soundtrack for the game is one of the best that I have ever heard, some songs are creepy, some are awesome, but sometimes they will start creepy and then they would sound kick butt. The gameplay is slow paste at first, but the more you level up, it will start to become a bit more fast paste and at some points chaotic. There is multiplayer, but you would need to download a program in order to play with your friends.   The story and chrectors are well written, the AI could be stupid at some points but its usually not a problem for this game.   I give this game a 8/10",

Now this game, System Shock 2, it's a doozy. I could recommend it solely because of the atmosphere it drapes over you. It's the only game I've played that actually reached in through my eye sockets, curled its wires around my spine, and really, truly made me feel powerless.   Imagine, if you can, my situation. I am trapped, trapped inside the twisting bowels of a vast machine, with just a little space to move around. And the more I move around, the more I realize, I am tangled in two machines - one of flesh, the other of hissing steel. A voice is guiding me, helping me, but it's just a voice. And as I wrench myself free from deep within this machine, violently stumbling out of the clutches of one chamber and into another, always the steel is watching from my front, and the flesh is grabbing at my heels.  I am never allowed to forget that between my scampering body and the dead vacuum of space lies a thin layer of aluminium and glass.  This game is not a cake-walk - it's a tough journey and a tough experience. If you like horror, you HAVE TO experience System Shock 2, the acme of the genre. There are a few brilliant moments in the game that made my brain drop whatever it was doing and just kind of kick and whimper. I recall saying things like 'Ga! It can't, wait, how? Oh hell, what?? No!' (And I'm a pretty jaded guy.) Some of these moments are big, others are small enough to miss for a while - and then, when they do hit, they hit really, really hard. It's just brilliant, singularly brilliant.  Even with the horror that is the graphical technology of 1999, the visuals in SS2 do a fantastic job. The NPC models are blurry by today's standards, but somehow so disturbing that they never lose their impact. The dying spaceship you're on is a masterpiece of design: corpses and debris are meaningfully scattered, each piece telling an aching story. The stellar sound design (by far, by far, the best I've encountered in any game) begs to be experienced. A sprawling RPG skillset and intrigueing sets of tools and weapons let you survive in any number of ways, all of them challenging.  I recommend playing the original System Shock first (the enhanced edition with all the sounds); it's not essential, but will give you a little more context and back-story. It is definitely worth playing just to experience the first chapter of what I think is the best villain in a video game. SS2 does a great job of painting the full picture, though.  I could host a week-long seminar about the great things this game achieves, but the truth is, you should simply experience it for yourself. Get the game now, and try to play it as coninuously as you can to avoid fragmenting the experience.",

System Shock 2 has a reputation as one of the best Survival Horror and/or FPS games ever made, so it couldn't be bad, right?  Well, it's not perfect, but what it does wel, it does really well.  We'll start with the positives. This game is one of the few I've discovered that gives a damn about the 'survival' in survival horror. Weapons degrade quickly, ammunition is rare, and a lot of the enemies will destroy you if you just charge into every fight. The game is nice and challenging.  Next, the atmosphere. Through a lot of the game, they manage to reach Ravenholm-level atmosphere, with enemies placed in the perfect locations for maximum jump-scare potentail. I'm not ashamed to admit that some of my least-dignified moments have come from the protocol droids- definitely the most paranoia-inducing enemies in the game. Not the most powerful, but if one sneaks up on you... You're probably going to die.  Now, it has gameplay and atmosphere down. What doesn't it do right?  Level design. A large number of the levels are divided up into mutiple parts, with each one having a separate checkpoint. You die without finding the checkpoint? Back to the load screen for you. Oftentimes, where each checkpoint services is completely arbitrary and nonsensical- five meters to the west is okay, but not five meters to the east, for example.  Worse, later evels remove the checkpoints entirely, but don't change up the gameplay to match the lack of this mechanic. I ended up having to completely restart the game after entering the last hour, thanks to running out of anti-rad hypos, anti-disease hypos, and health items on top of bullets. I would have restocked, but I didn't have enough money. The entire last area is unwinnabe unless you're perfectly well-stocked.  Overall, however, the game itself is solid, and recommended for any fan of survival horror and shooters.",

Featuring two really creepy antagonists, a wealth of mechanics, and the freedom to play how you want, it was hailed as a game that defied genre classification and considered to be quite ahead of its time. It's not without its flaws, however.

But all the strategies and options you have for how to take on enemies makes up for it.  -It's a game from 1999 and it's already scared me 4 times.  -The story and setting are fantastic.  -Good options menu. (You can fully rebind controls and save control pre-sets)  NUETRAL ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -The graphics don't look all that great from a technical standpoint, but because of the art direction it still holds up ok.  CONS ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -Difficulty can be a frustrating at times if you make a big mistake, or have no ammo for a section that reguires a ranged attack. Also you are required to have a research skill of 1, and a hacking skill of 3 in order to finish the game.  -The GUI is awkward to use and just doesn't look good, especially the map.  -Music completely ruins the atmosphere. I HIGHLY recommend turning it off before playing.  VERDICT ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  The best sci-fi horror game of all time. Even at full price this game is totally worth it. 5/5",

            "review_text": "As tends to happen when people don't experience a 'classic' until long after they came about, they are sometimes skeptical. I am not very skeptical about games that much, usually. In fact, I will often assume a game is better than what people say, but you can't do much more if they say the game is the 'best' ever, which many people say about System Shock 2. But after completing it, I have to say:  Play this game! Get it! If you've ever wondered about it, don't wait any longer!  This game has landed in the group of my favorite games of all time. It stands the test of time in just about every aspect. And for a game in the 1990's, that is a great feat. I have played all of the BioShock games before I have played this predecessor, and I have to say that System Shock 2 has pretty much all of the features of the BioShock games, and even more. That is not to say that it suddenly changed my opinion of the BioShock games. They are all put together very well in their own ways and I love them too (hence why I have them on Steam after beating them on console).  System Shock 2 is a challenging game, but very rewarding. I will advise not to play on the hardest difficulties on your first try though, as the game will quickly throw you aside. Technically, you don't have to worry about dying if you want to keep reusing the regenerators that you find in each level, but they cost money (unlike in the later BioShock games), thus you can't keep dying forever. However, I find that doing so will ruin the atmosphere of the game, so do your best to play it well; but don't try to be a perfectionist either, or you will ruin the fun that way.  I liked the RPG aspects of the game, being able to modify items and upgrade your character. In some sense, they were just there to make the game harder as you can't use some items for a while, or hacking is worse. But they are still relatively balanced for the most part, except for PSI Powers. Honestly, most of the PSI Powers are useless and even if you invest heavily in them, you won't get that far. I feel like on hardest difficulties, using them at all wouldn't do any good. Others may say you can get far with them, but I just stuck to standard weapons and melee for the most part.  Exploring the ship(s) was interesting, as the environments were relatively different in certain decks. The creatures around were very creepy, though eventually wore off on me and I wasn't as freaked out as I was at the start of the game. The game requires you to backtrack a lot at different times, which was rather bothersome, but the story kept me focused, and the audio logs that you find are very well-done for a game made at this time. It is interesting to see how a small set of characters made it (or didn't) through the events with the Annelids.  The sound in the game was relatively well-done, aiding in the atmosphere. I enjoyed the music itself, but it did take away from the vibe of the game, and also makes it hard to hear enemies at times. Thankfully, it wasn't played that much in most areas, so I left it on. As said above, the audio logs were really well-done. All of the voice acting was great and kept me engaged.  Speaking of voice acting, the best part of the game was SHODAN. A very interesting character with a very interesting backstory. All throughout the game, I felt very afraid of her, wondering how things were going to turn out. I think that the voice alterations done for SHODAN's audio were perfect and that she made the game entirely. She made the story much better, as I feel like the general exploration and backtracking would have worn you down without such a captivating person (or thing!) at your side the whole time.  The only thing in the game that didn't really hold up well is the graphics, which isn't that surprising. But most games are still playable if you don't worry too much about the physical appearance. If you are, however, a stickler for how a game looks (even when it's as old as this one), then you'll be happy to know that there are very good mods you can download to improve the looks if need be.  Really, the only thing that disappointed me about the game was the ending. I won't go into any detail here, but many people agree with me. It ruined the tone of the game and was rather sloppily done. I wish there had been something better done with it, as essentially throwing your players' hours of hard work away is terrible.  But I have to say, play this game. Everything is put together well, especially for when this game was made. I only grew more excited as I kept playing and never got bored. As I said, I think the largest factor of that was SHODAN and the story with her. Easily one of the best video game characters of all time.",

Given the importance of the twists and turns for the full 'System Shock 2 Experience'(TM), those who haven't played the game to completion should probably stop reading (that is if you've somehow avoided spoilers for an 18 year old game). If you're just looking for a recommendation, well... it's System Shock 2. It's a classic. Play it for your sake, if for no other reason.  With that disclaimer out of the way, on to my actual thoughts on the game.   If you somehow couldn't tell from the disclaimer and convenient large blue thumb showing its appreciation, i quite liked System Shock 2. The story is intriguing, the environments uniquely disturbing, and if you can stand the cluttered interface you'll find an RPG with a surprising amount of equally viable strategies and builds. And holy cow, that atmosphere. I personally challenge anyone to play the game for more than an hour and not feel engrossed by the world and the characters (the very vast majority of which are either found as audio logs or, optionally, cadavers). In particular, the Many are a great departure from the usual 'beastly alien' found in science fiction, adopting the role of a foil to SHODAN's icy discontent at your presence.  Particularly, i think that the use of visual storytelling is brilliant in SS2. The layout feels like a logical way for a space frigate would, and the many obstacles in your way are a great way of familiarizing oneself with an area and then thinking about the next as a connected part of a monstrous, living organism. That's probably the best way to describe the environment: a creaking, delapidated, and rather irate monster hell-bent on introducing you to demise in as gruesome a method as possible. The sense of isolation is strengthened by the fact that you are the only living human on the Von Braun ; everyone else has left, is dying, or is in the process of doing so. It makes that feeling of creeping dread a lot more present.  In terms of content, the game feels just about perfect. While there is a bit of backtracking, it never feels too forced, and tends to increase the tension on higher difficulties. My first playthrough clocked in around 16 hours (pay no mind to my hours) and i still feel interested enough to give it another go on a higher difficulty with a different specialization.  So, it's a highly atmospheric, well-designed, and surprisingly replayable game. Go buy it. It's awesome. ",

System Shock 2 is one of the most influential games of all times, yadda yadda, masterpiece, yadda yadda. Long story short this is where BioShock came from. You can trace it back to System Shock, but System shock even in comparison to 2 is a primitive, vastly inferior game.  Essentially SS2 plays out very similarly to BioShock games. You're a dude, thrust into a situation - although System Shock 2 being far heavier on the RPG elements actually gives you a training course and an entire section during which you create your character and choose their path - and things spiral out of control as you, the player, move the story forward and realize you're nothing but a pawn. Setting those nuances aside, SS2 is still very much an FPS first and an RPG second. You will be killing a lot of things, with a lot of different weapons, and a lot of them will probably break too, not to mention be beyond your ability to mod or repair for a significant portion of the game. Fortunately for you, if you're terrible at aiming, the hit boxes for enemies are very large, considering the game is from 1999.  And yes, you'll probably get killed by a monkey, and turrets, and radiation.  Many sources will tell you SS2 was a landmark for storytelling and player driven narrative (though HL1 is probably more so) but SS2 basically took the concept of finding plot bits in written form - like in Resident Evil - and converting them to audio. It gives life to the characters, and adds a new layer of immersion when you unravel a story as if you are actually listening to the audio logs or reports or whatever left by these people. Just like BioShock 1, 2, 3, and Dead Space 1, 2, and 3. Other than that, SS2 is definitely one of the first games that screwed with you - a lot.  You can easily get this game for 1 dollar on Steam and pretty much anywhere else, when the sales are right, and after you do that, there are a wealth of well preserved mods on the internet to try and update the 16 year old graphics to something slightly more pleasant on the eyes. Unfortunately there is no complete remake, and likely never will be, but if you're going to take the leap, you may as well play the original anyway.",

Thief 2 wisely avoided combat entirely for this reason, but unfortunately too much of 'System Shock 2' is just straight up combat. The early portions of the game when you are just getting your bearings and exploring the ship level by level are entertaining enough, but as the game progresses it turns into a much more tedious corridor shooter. Ammo is scarce, enemies are repetitive and, even worse, they repeatedly respawn. Like Thief, the levels are massive and thus easy to get lost in, but unlike Thief they are not all that varied or well designed. And as the game progresses too much of your time is spent back tracking over areas you've already covered on tedious object hunts which usually don't amount to much more than cleverly disguised 'find the red, blue, green, etc, etc keys to advance' style of game play that used to be 1990s FPS' stock and trade.   There are some brilliant ideas here (it has tons of atmosphere, the scarcity of ammo really creates a palpable sense of desperation and fear at times, and Shodan is one of the most memorable and influential video game villains ever for reasons that would probably be too spoilery to go into), but for all its innovation and clever ideas unfortunately the core game play just isn't that fun.",

I'll just make a cynical starting point here - System Shock 2 was nothing terribly new when it came out. A disastor story set in deep space dealing with parasitic aliens taking over mankind's greatest achievement in space travel - a faster-than-light starship. It's the sort of story that has been done to death, no doubt because Alien made it an insanely popular concept. Then again, it is a perfect set-up of scares and despair.  But what helps System Shock 2 stand out is its execution, much like its prequel. Through the masterful use of sound, color, and lighting, a scenario we are quite familiar with is presented in just the right way for a video game: compelling and terrifying, but fun. Add in its unique take of the FPS-RPG hybrid and you have a game with incredible depth and replayability.  To put everything in context, this is an old-school survival horror game (scarce resources, exploration, fetch quests, etc.) with ideas that put it years ahead of its time. The game is all about building a character whose strengths and talents match your preferences; character growth essentially, since the main character is you pretty much. What is most important to note is that the interface and the RPG elements themselves are not convulted, but innovative. After brief explainations, it is easy to understand how it all works and pick up the little bits and pieces along the way. In the end, you will become addicted.  Lastly, the scare factor of this game is found everywhere. You can hear it as the ambience plays, broken lights flicker, or an unknown assilant walks by. You can see it in the blood-written messages, foreboding darkness, or the state of disrepair. You can feel it when you realize how so very alone you are with a threat around every corner, in every shape and size. No one is going to save you. All it will take is a moment of weakness for the horrors of the von Braun to consume you.  But brave through all of that and you will know why this is one of the best games of all time.",

The player models are a bit 'ugh' but aside from that the graphics are quite good for the time it was released. The one thing I didn't really like about it was that the default controls really suck. W is forward (as usual), but A and D were turn left and right, respectivly, and S was crouch, whereas Z and C were strafe left and right, respectivly, and X was backward. Of course, this can be easily changed, so it is but a minor annoyance. The thing that first hit me about this game was the tutorial. Most of the time, the tutorials in games are crudly done (Half-Life) or very vague (Ghost Recon) if existant at all (Day of Defeat). System Shock 2 takes tutorials to a whole new level. It's very thorough and fits into the storyline like a cute glove. And if you're on your second playthrough, you can skip the tutorial completely. However, if it is your first time playing, you really should play it. This is not just another FPS. This is unique. So how much is this worth? More than Steam is selling it for. If you don't like RPGs, you wouldn't like this. If you only play modern games because 'GWAFIXXXXX', stop it for this game. You can't just not play it. Oh, and by the way, there is a co-op mode.

But if you want to play the grand father of Dead Space and Bioshock and have a look, what ancient knowledge these games remember (and which they did forget!), then this is the adress to go to!  Story writing of System Shock is on eye level with stuff like Dead Space 1. Not great, but definetely servicable. Voice acting is great (and everything is voice acted!). The graphics are... well... ancient. But work well enough as to not being confusing. You will be able to tell apart enemies from kitchen wear. The game mechanics are... awesome! Really, not by 1999 standards, but by today's standards. You got different weapon types, you can specialize on, different psy abilities, you might learn, but you also have to learn, how to maintain and repair your equipment. You need to manage your resources... honestly: Quite a few of today's survival games should REALLY have a close look on System Shock 2 and reconsider their mechanics!  So, good game with lots of nostalgia value (remember the waxd as your default move keys?). Play it, if haven't already. That is, if you are into shooters and you can stand the rather old graphics. Check them out, before you buy the game.  For those, who want to try it out, here are's a word of advice, so you don't mess up your character and have to start over again: -The most powerful weapons in the game are the pistol, the grenade launcher (and to a smaller degree the shotgun). Learn to use these and don't mind about the other weapons, unless you got some leftover points late in the game. -Psy is funny, but not that powerful. Don't spend too much on it. Cyber affinity is a must have, though. -Hacking is very useful! Lvl 4 is recommended. Repair 1 is the only thing you need for the important weapons. Maintenance needs a few points. -I didn't find the stats, besides strength all that useful. -Save ammo and nanites, whenever you can! There are a few rather tough sections during which you'll go through your resources as if you there'd be no tomorrow! Make sure, you got some! Otherwise... there are plenty of ways to play the game (even pure psy run-throughs oO), though some are more difficult than other. But, hey! Try to find your own way through the Von Braun ;)",

Graphics and bloody has nothing to do it with Its all about the story line and immersing the player in the storeline as if he/she were there. The PDA's, voxophones, whatever you want to call it. The classic SS2 drum and base in engineering. The medic hypos sound effects. Its all about these small little things that add up to something quite special. The fact that when you open the inventory it freezes the player is great. It creates tension if someone is running towards you with a pipe. Why should the game just freeze and stop when you want to look at inventory this creates a safehouse for the user. In SS2 no where is safe and its this that makes this game epic! 5*",

Overall, the game was way ahead of its time and gameplay wise the depth it offers has surpassed even most, if not all of the modern titles. Bioshock Infinite is a joke when compared with SyS2, the only selling point of the former is that the plot is 'deep', but to me that's just artificial mind♥♥♥♥ery that appears to be deep, I have no idea why such a mediocre shooter could be so overhyped. tis really a shame that most modern gamers have never even heard of System Shock, and no more titles like this can be produced today even though the budgets of modern video games are much much larger.

Lastly, because it's been around for so long, that pie now has many stories to tell and further more, it demands that you listen to them; thankfully it's pretty good at doing that and it's probably the only reason you haven't tossed that rotting pie in the garbage by the time you get to the Rickenbacker and you realise you're grossly underpowered.",

            "review_text": "I bought a hard copy of this game many years ago at the insistence of friends that game was pure brilliance and wow, they were right. I loved every minute of playing through that game, searching for ammo and audio logs, fighting back the Many while trying to piece together what happened. The atmosphere, the difficulty, the tension, it was all fantastic and it created this visceral, rewarding experience. In a way, this is very much like the original Resident Evil games, only it's approaching survival horror another way and producing it's own unique, rich experience in the process. This game easily fits onto many 'must play' lists and it's easy to see why.  When I got a Steam message one day about how this game is now available to purchase on Steam for a small fee and you can bet your backside I snapped it up harder and faster than a crackhead grabbing a baggie of drugs off the floor after it falls out of someone's pocket. I loaded it up and dived into the hell aboard the Von Braun and UNN Rickenbacker once again, my trusty wrench at my side. Naturally, for a game that was about 16 years old (at the time of my playthrough), the graphics were a tad dated compared to more modern offerings, but after 5 minutes I was so hooked on the game that I didn't even notice. The sound design of things like the hybrids begging for you to run so they don't kill you, the everyday musings from the ships inhabitants on the audio logs scattered around the ships and the announcements of Xerxes over the PA system combined with visuals of messages written on the walls in blood, bullet holes stitching the walls and the clash of nice looking ship interiors that have been sullied with violence and gore make for a wonderful inducement of dread as you try to slip through the ship, trying to source more ammunition for your trusty pistol and frantically trying to bash in the skull of a shotgun wielding hybrid with a wrench after it surprises you by coming out of a doorway you didn't expect. This game was a more palpable experience than many games I've played in the last few years, despite the fact that some, myself not included, would argue that this game has aged poorly.  If you're someone that can look past a game being older (I.E. you won't refuse to play a game because it doesn't have the latest in graphics), I urge you to give this game a shot. Look up some videos of the gameplay (speedruns don't count, as they're intentionally skipping a lot of stuff), read some reviews and if you're not sure, just wait for a sale to pick up the game. Sure, you'll have to do a tiny bit of control rebinding (it's not that big of deal) and you *will* die a few times at first, but bear with it and you'll find a very enjoyable gameplay experience waiting for you within. There's a reason people love this game so much and I'd very much like for other people to understand why. Hell, after hearing some of the audio logs from the game on a Youtube video, I'm thinking about playing through this game again myself and after writing all of this, I think I will.",

Back then the game wasn't really scary at all, but when you actually in control, you'll feel the intensity, you won't feel safe. When you walk through the silent corridors with dead bodies, rooms that you thought it was safe until you heard someone mumble 'Kill me~' or 'You don't belong here~' while you were busy setting up your inventory or levelling up, you'll feel that intensity, pressing buttons in panick, thinking what weapon should you choose, and then zombies or cyborg girl come in swarm. You gotta be ready by then.  SS 2 is a combination of FPS and Action-RPG. Yes there are level ups, equipment systems, etc. For example you can't use shotgun without levelling up a bit, increasing your status. You can't use decent armor without increasing your STR stat, and so on. The gameplay you'll find similar to Doom 3, you'll be given objectives, and you gotta starts exploring on your own. No waypoint like in BioShock. Overall this game is pretty decent, modern gamers should try this.  ",

            "review_text": "System Shock 2 has been mentioned often as one of the best games ever made and seems to be the favorite game of many. After the digital release, I was finally able to experience the game and see for myself.  The gameplay is a mixture of RPG and FPS. The RPG part brings some depth in the game, but the implementation is a bit lacking. With the exception of psi-powers, the difference between a new character and one fully developed is noticeable, but too little. For example, a fully developed standard weapons skill along with a high agility makes it easy to snipe enemies from the distance, but aiming was not that hard to begin with. A higher skill makes better weapons available, though. Regarding this, it seems a bit dumb that a marine does not know how to use an assault rifle at the start of the game. The skills in this game prepare you for battle, since there are no alternative ways of doing things. If there is a tough enemy guarding an enterance, the only way inside is to kill the enemy. I didn't notice any option to negotiate or hack a backdoor to find my way inside.  The most original part of character development is research, which makes some alien artifacts available for use. Researching is often not completed with just a click of a button, but the player also needs to find appropriate chemicals to complete the research.  It is not necessary to complete the first System Shock to play this game, although there are some minor references. There are some minor twists in the story, but otherwise the plot is pretty average. Finding out what happened on the ship is revealed through audio logs, which are occasionally interesting to listen. The game starts getting a bit boring at some point, as there seems to be hardly any progress in the story and the player is forced to scour the levels for the next item needed for progress.  The game has a good atmosphere, which makes the player feel that they are under a constant threat, but sadly the surroundings often kills the immersion. Sometimes the layout of the levels make sense, but often they resemble narrow labyrinths and make you wonder why the ship was built that way. The levels are mostly freely explorable and have several paths. You can even go back to previously visited places, but there is hardly ever any reason, since key cards and -codes for any locked areas are never found in later levels (or at least that's how I found it). Some of the enemies seems a bit unfitting to the environment as well. The game also has unlimited enemies spawning out of nowhere, but in my opinion the spawning rate is not too bad and some areas seem to be safe.  Having been released in 1999, the game looks dated. This can be remedied a bit with mods, but I'm not bothered by the visuals anyway. The voice acting is generally good and the ambient sounds add to the atmosphere, but some of the enemies sound awful. I also turned off the music pretty fast, as the electronic tunes broke the immersion more than anything else.  The game is playable, but I just could not see why so many people think it's still so amazing. Some better enemies, better level design and a more interesting story would be something I need to enjoy this game more. I can recommend it to anyone who likes Deus Ex and Thief (the original ones) and those who want to see what the fuzz is about. The game was not great but, not bad either.  5/10",

Instead of relying on jump scares, System Shock 2 prefers to latch on to your sanity and slowly pry. While the enemies aren't the most terrifying or challenging, your scenario is. Being completely alone an a vessel floating in the far reaches of space doesn't help put the mind at ease. The DETERIORATION of your weapons, to the point where they jam and are rendered useless, not to mention the scarcity of ammunition provides a healthy amount of fear. Health is also scarce, and it takes time to build skills for more efficient playing. Transversing the sheer magnitude of the Von Braun, entirely on foot, while avoiding enemies as much as possible made me tense enough to require regular chiropractic visits for the rest of my life. Not really, but it feels like it. Lastly, SHODAN's voice always haunts you, taunts you, breaks you. She never stops and she's always one step ahead. This game is a truly horrifying experience.",

Of course, this can be easily changed, so it is but a minor annoyance. The thing that first hit me about this game was the tutorial. Most of the time, the tutorials in games are crudly done (Half-Life) or very vague (Ghost Recon) if existant at all (Day of Defeat). System Shock 2 takes tutorials to a whole new level. It's very thorough and fits into the storyline like a cute glove. And if you're on your second playthrough, you can skip the tutorial completely. However, if it is your first time playing, you really should play it. This is not just another FPS. This is unique. So how much is this worth? More than Steam is selling it for.

A game that was pretty good for its time and still is pretty good, but could have been a lot better had the developers had the time and money to make this game be something even better. Unfortunately, the developers didn't, and as a result, the game suffers from quite a number of flaws, such as poor hit detection, an in-game plot that is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ (not counting the magnificently done audio-logs, which are actually good), clunky platforming (this made the Body of the Many a pain in the ♥♥♥), AI that can be quite stupid at times and one of the worst ending I have ever seen in a game period! What the game does quite well however is making a tense atmosphere by having you be careful with your ammo (which is scarse in this game unless you have a bunch of nanites (in-game currency) to buy them from replicators), clever use of sound design and great music. As mentioned before, the game does have a very good back story that you find through audio logs scattered around the ships detailing the events that take place before you wake up from five months in cryo-sleep and a surprisingly deep RPG system, allowing you to build the character you want to build through the use of cyber modules, which are given to you by completing tasks or by finding them, usually in dead corpses or in some containers. In the end, System Shock 2 is definitely a game that is fun to play, but could have been so much more, and as much as I wish for there to be a true sequel to SS3 or a remake that is faithful to the original but improves on its faults, I don't think it will happen any time soon. Recommended for fans of the FPSRPG hybrid, especially if you want to see one of the games that helped build upon the FPSRPG hugely.",

Scavenging in bins for snacks and currency, PSI usage, reliance on hypo's for healing, Weapons having a maximum of two modifications. The major difference is while the 'Plasmid' powers are more easily accessible, and the RPG elements have been streamlined and omitted.  Add the tempramental co-op (that's mostly buggy because of the age of the game I believe.

However, there are some VERY important criticisms that you might want to know before playing:  -The game is difficult, and while it is usually pretty fair, there are some very, VERY unfair sections. [PSI reavers and the radiation water in the BotM come to mind] -Weapons are really unbalanced. Any first time player is essentially forced to use Standard weapons, since all the other weapon classes have one really good weapon and two really crap weapons, with the excetion of Energy's EMP rifle [Also, kudos to Looking Glass for creating the Stasis Field Generator, the most useless weapon since the Giant's Knife] -The annelid worms. These parasitic buggers are the worst thing... Ever. They serve no real in game purpose other than to annoy and irritate. They can be killed in one hit with any non energy weapon, but you can't use melee against them because they're too small, they never stop moving, and the hand-to-hand collision detection is bugger all. So, you end up wasting about 50 bullets worth of ammo on these pests, and in game that's THIS heavy on resource management, you might as well start tossing your med hypos into the never-ending vacuum of space.  However, the Pros outweigh the cons greatly. Specifically...  -The atmosphere. Put on headphones. Turn off the lights. Play for 5 hours straight. I can't even properly describe it. -The depth. Games like Bioshock and Human Revolution are massively fun, but they tend to be more action games than they are RPG's. Make no mistake; System Shock is an RPG, and a fine example at that. Easily my favorite feature is how it handles exerience, not as a well to be drawn from, but as a resource to be handled wisely. You HAVE to specialize and think long term when picking skills. -SHODAN.  So, should you play this game? Well, if you like RPG's, and you haven't, then you're kind of obligated to. So do it.

Seriously, this game had me terrified as I ran around trying to determine whether or not it was safe for me to try opening up my inventory to repair my weapons. The enemies are a constant threat, as most of them will respawn indefinately, so there is always some voice screaming in your ear, and you'll have no way to gauge where it's coming from. Weapons have a degredation system, and slowly break down with use, so you'll find yourself either throwing weapons away constantly, sticking to the few weapons that don't degrade, or scanning the area frantically for maintenance tools and working on your repair skill. SHODAN and the Many as the two primary antagonists are absolutely fantastic, and will fascinate, terrify, and aggrivate you throughout the game. If there was anything that I had any real problem with, it would be the AI, as enemy patterns are incredibly easy to figure out, and there are some real simple tricks in certain areas to prevent them from attacking at all, (although I won't say what they are), but the need to explore should get you past that issue, and quite frankly, the AI, despite being now quite old, is still leagues better than some other fps and horror games I've played.

However I would suggest playing on your own first to understand what it is like helplessly being on your own while scrambling to survive, doing what another survivor is telling you via radio communication.  While you might feel like you are getting stronger receiving upgrading modules, the games difficulty progressivly gets harder and more challenging a long with the different and creepy kinds of enemys you face. The story is quite rich and each recording picked up adds a peice to the puzzle, all while painting a deeper picture of the environment you are in.  The RPG elements means you can customise your characters abilities: -Physically (strength, agility, etc).  -Technically (hacking/repair/research/modifiying weapons). -Weapons (the more invested allows for better use and abilities to use more advanced weapons in that field).  -Psionically (use a psi amp to attack enemys and substituting your lack in other areas with temporary boosts and abilities). While you may start out in any given field, you can branch out based on your personal play style.  The music is quite awesome for its time and again different to many games out there. The scenery and environment is involved and at times interacted with.  As a whole the game pushed many boundaries and is very different.

Despite a rough start getting the game to run in widescreen mode, I eventually managed to switch to 1080p and started to play.  I can now say that it is nothing short of a masterpiece! The kicker for me is the spectacular audio design combined with the dark, brooding atmosphere. As opposed to what many others have said, I actually really loved the fast-paced electro music once I turned the volume down a bit. Since the music usually starts up in areas swarming with enemies, it really gets your muscles on edge and your mind alert as you shakily turn the claustrophobic corners, always low on health and on your last clip, not knowing what lays in the dark corridor ahead. And SHODAN's distorted, seductive voice crackling over the PA forcing you to do her bidding is just... wow!  Beware, the gameplay is really complex and doesn't hold your hand; you may not even like it the first time. I only played for about 2 hours, on and off, before I set it down and forgot about it for a few weeks. Feeling bored one day, I decided to try it again. Now I've clocked in at around 10 hours already! The game 'clicked' for me when I listened to all the audio logs in a secluded safe spot where I could finally let my guard down.  Now that I have grown accustomed to System Shock 2's unique and multifaceted gameplay and appreciated the storyline that envelops it, I can safely say that this is the best video game I have ever played! I heartily recommend it. Buy it now, and join the Many.  Linux users note: When it comes to graphical quality (this game is from '99 after all), mods are your friend!

It is fascinating and inspired. + Has a wide range of weaponry with both 'space-magic', laser guns and standard bullet type and otherworldy alien arms. + Enemies are downright scary and will make you feel uncomfortable right away. They'll give you an enclosed feeling of loneliness. + Game is very difficult at first since you don't know what you're doing. But is rewarding once you get used to it in both fun and skill. + The ambience and music are well thought out, it will throw you right into the frey with fast-paced techno music giving you an alarmed feeling whilst still keeping its creepy atmosphere. And by God if Med Sci 1 isn't the best techno tune ever I don't know what is. + Ammunition and other resources can be quite scarce if you're not careful, making you want to avoid combat. You must be cautious of how you use/manage your items. Learn melee combat! + Very easy to mod. + The map design is why I love both System Shock and System Shock 2.

I've seen lego toys with more polygons. There isn't too much story and basically just puts you in a bad situation and you make your own stories as you try to escape.
