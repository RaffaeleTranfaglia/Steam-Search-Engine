            "review_text": "  I played this on the Oculus RIft incase your wondering if it supports it, yes it does. Top notch game. Great Quality. Simplistic tone with relaxing music that wont distract the game play. You can move around in the world by using the other directional pad and the RB and LB buttons to go up and down on the xbox controller if you want a different view. There also some challenge modes to practice situations if you dont wanna start a fresh game. If your bad at chess like I am then its a great learning tool and if your a seasond chess player you'll love it. Very remniciant of the late 80s early 90s Battlechess games but WAYYYYY MORE immerisve.",
