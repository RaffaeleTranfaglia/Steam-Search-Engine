            "review_text": "A decent entry level strategy game. While not as deep as games such as Hearts of Iron, it offers a fair amount of depth. Things like research and diplomacy are in the game, but not so detailed or timed consumer that they take away from the game. If you are looking for something fun that can be played in a few sittings then consider Strategic war in Europe.  Key points of the game  Unit types:    The types of units include Infantry, Mechanized, Armor, Airborne, Fighters, tactical bombers, strategic Bombers, and a verity of Naval units. Land units (except Airborne which are corps) can be bought as either army or corps. Armies are bigger and thus cost more. Depending on the size and type of unit it will be ready for deployment in 1 - 3 turns.  Research:    Players can research, infantry, armor airplanes, navel, subs and nuclear bombs. Nuclear bombs are only one level (you either have them or you don't) and once you do you gain a bomb every few turns which can be dropped by one of your strategic bombers.  All the others come in five levels (some countries start at higher levels than others) and each level needs 100 points to reach. Players spend production points to increase research effort in the area of their choice. Any area can have up to three investments (represented by light bulbs), the first one cost 200, but the price for future ones goes down as the research gets closer to the 100 mark. For example if you buy all three investments upfront it will cost you 600 (3 * 200); but if you buy the initial 200 and wait a few turns the next investment might only cost 170. I seen it go as low as 30 when it was 87 out of the 100 needed. Of course once 100 is reached that level is unlocked and all the light bulbs go out and the player must start investing again  Nukes work slightly differently, there is only one level that needs 800 point and the initial investment is 1000 production points.  As new levels unlock better units can be bought at an increased price. For example if you ahve 4 levels of infantry unlocked you can buy them at any of those four levels.   Mod support:    While there is not allot of stuff in the workshop yet the game does allow for mods. Want to change something, simply ask the developers on the forums and they will point you in the right direction. They even explain to one user how to remove the turn limit  Scenarios:   There are a great number of scenarios included; ranging from beginning of D-day (13 turns) to full campaign (70 turns). Other options start with Operation Barbarossa and even a what if, that has the Allies fighting the Russians after the fall of Germany  Play as any country or countries:   One thing I really like is the ability to play as multiple countries. Where most games let you only play one, here you can play as many as you like. This really helps in saturations like the invasion of Russia where in many games the players German troops get stuck behind the AI Italian or minor axis allies forces. In fact if you want to play as all the axis, all the allies or as Russia there is even a quick start where you pick a faction and control all the nations in it  Difficulty set by country:   You can set the difficulty level for each country in the game. The different levels adjust how much income the nations receives. This allows you to boost or subtract from nations for some interesting what if. Say the Italian economy was more in line with the other nations, or America was not the economic powerhouse that it turned out to be.   CONS:    Like any game Strategic War in Europe does come with its faults. The two biggest are: Random crashes and achievements not opening up. In both cases the developers are on the forums discussing the issues and are actively working the solution",

            "review_text": "Ok i have played for awhile with this game so here you go. First off yes i have encountered bugs. 1. Game tends to crash if you DON'T apply a 1 second delay to the AI's turns. 2. Also encountered a crash bug while using a question mark in my save game title , such as : Invasion of France ?.......save - click - crash. I posted this one. 3. Others have reported problems using very high resolutions to play ( i personally run 1280x1024 and have no problems with screen/buttons etc,etc) Now for the game itself i haven't had it crash after making these changes and would give the game a solid B-. It's not as hard or confusing and micromanged as Hearts of Iron and just a bit more complex than the old Axis and Allies pc game or board game. So when it's on sale i would recommend getting it but make sure you make a few changes to the options before warring it up.",

Bugs are pretty common, but also crashes on a regular basis. The naval system, is pretty much broken and or the map data is corrupt. Play wise, I would highly recommend this game, but its still one or two patches away from a finished product. Can't recommend it for that but so close to being a great game.",
