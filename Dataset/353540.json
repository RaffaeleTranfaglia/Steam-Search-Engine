            "review_text": "A truly brilliant puzzle game. It takes the mechanics so much further than you would imagine, to the point there are genuinely 'Oh my god, did that just happen?' moments. I got 30 hours of thoroughly enjoyable play out of this and can see myself playing it again at some point, so it was worth every penny. I have only positive points to make:  - Very challenging puzzles right from the get-go. - There *is* a learning curve - a very well crafted one - it just starts you off high. I'd say the level of difficulty is consistent throughout (given that you are also learning as you go). - There are a lot of puzzles. - The puzzles are meticulously designed such that they all have very interesting, completely different solutions and you can see how everything was arranged to make that solution and only that solution work. - Pretty much every puzzle twists what you know about the mechanics (some will have you proclaiming 'This is impossible!' before you *get* it). - Every puzzle is super satisfying (to the point I'm shouting YESSSSS after each one). - The graphics and audio are very well designed to not get in the way but also add a lot of character. - Exploring the overworld is very enjoyable. - You truly feel like you've improved as a puzzle solver by the end of it - there's a very definite evolution in the way you think about the puzzles.  There was almost a point early in the game (maybe 2-3 hours in) where I could have stopped playing, simply because I couldn't see where it was going. If you get past that hurdle, you'll be glad you did.  Perfect for puzzle fans. Couldn't recommend it enough. Also recommend having a friend playing the game as well so you can talk about ideas and spur each other on. If you're not sure, give it a try.",

The game never punishes you for your mistakes as you are free to undo all your moves at any point. I also like how the game lets you play past the point of failure and discover new level and sausage rolling mechanics through trial and error.  I looked up the solution to one puzzle and I regretted it.",

            "review_text": "First off, this game is *difficult*. But it's a fair difficulty if you have experience with puzzles. If you don't have prior experience but want a difficult puzzle game you can actually complete, you would be better off playing either English Country Tune or Snakebird first. Go ahead and pick up those two titles first, and complete them. Those are easier than this, but still quite difficult for a first-timer.  Now, a review for those of us who are actually experienced in puzzle games (but somehow haven't bought this?).  Stephen's Sausage Roll is a puzzle game that, first and foremost, prides itself on having some of the most ludicrously difficult puzzles, yet having merely a small handful of fairly simple rules. Think Fish Fillets, Hana no Puzzle, and Snakebird. You play as the titular Stephen, who has crashed her ship on the Island of Wisdom and must presumably find her way back home. However, the island is strange; it has sand and grass as you'd expect from an island, but it also has mysterious pink cubes, metal grilles, and ghostly versions of Stephen herself.  Oh, and Stephen for some reason holds a giant fork. Don't ask why, because I don't know. Maybe that's her ship's anchor or something.  At this point, you're probably wondering what the gameplay is like. I understand; the trailer doesn't show anything, you don't want to spoil yourself too much by reading reviews on external sites, but you're not sure if this game really is worth the 23GBP. So I'll say this much:  The pink cubes are sausages, the metal grilles are grills, and you have to grill each sausage by pushing them onto the grills. Take care not to burn them or lose them in the water. It's like Sokoban, but more difficult due to the giant fork that Stephen's swinging around, making it annoying for her to move. But that's where the 'puzzle' part of the game comes from.  It's really not too easy to describe the difficulty of a puzzle, but I'll give it a try; on one level, the obvious path of 'push both sausages together' ends up burning one of them. Many people get stuck here when they try and push one of the sausages out the way and fail. On another level, there is a moat around the two solitary grills in the centre, and you somehow need to get the sausage over the moat and onto the grill. Then there's the tricksy Clover level, where you think you have the solution, but need to avoid getting trapped. On yet another level, you have to somehow juggle around three sausages on a small island, while making sure that none of them push each other off the island.  Many times, when I've shown the game to my friends, they've all played a level for 15 minutes and simply given up, claiming that the level is impossible.  Well, that's just the first island. The second island unlocks once you've completed all the puzzles in the first island and not before, so if you're not a completionist for puzzles, this game is probably not for you.  In the second island, there is a new game mechanic introduced; but unlike many other games, this game mechanic had always existed; it was just unapplicable in the first island (no spoilers as to what the mechanic is), and it's at that point that you really gain an appreciation for just how well-designed this game is, if you hadn't already gleaned it from the previous levels.  Basically, what I'm saying is this; if you're not good at puzzles, then your 23GBP would be better spent on The Witness, The Talos Principle, or a combination of cheaper puzzle games; you would probably just get frustrated at this game and refund it after getting stuck on a bunch of levels in the first world. If you're good at puzzles, this should already be in your library, so go play it now.  Oh, and don't worry about the infamous 'Tower' level. It's really not that large of a jump in difficulty.",

            "review_text": "I dream about sausages now. I think of sausages and how they roll. I wanted an aerodynamic fork, and if you do, this game might be for you.  Deli-cious sau-sages.  Made from succulent pigs. Don't like rolling sausages for moral reasons? This game might be for you.  The geometry of the common marbled sausage is round. This property allows them to be rolled. Rolling a sausage is like playing the piano - hard to master, but very rewarding. Burning a piano is also frowned upon. Much like sausages.  If you lose a sausage at sea, it is lost. Where do you go, little sausage? No High Arts can save you now, my fortune telling friend.  There was a great review here, once. Now, there is something even greater.",

But you won't mind. Because you'll know the truth. The true beauty that is Stephen's Sausage Roll.

I see a negative review saying 'the game is so relentless in its difficulty'. I completely agree with the review. I even understand that the reviewer, who is surely better at this game than I am (I feel even the puzzles before the Great Tower are merciless), does not recommend this game because it's too hard. Yet I should recommend this game. I enjoyed being hopeless while I have been playing this game.  The learning curve can be compared to climbing the height of Mount Everest in a day. Deadly. Do not expect a single puzzle that simply 'displays' the game's mechanism.  My friend recommends Snakebird. I think I should play that too.  Edit: I've been playing Snakebird for some time. Similar to this game, Snakebird has simple idea with advanced yet straightforward mechanics. But so far this game is much more challenging.  Edit 2: After solving all non-cloud puzzles I can definitely say that while Snakebird is a well-made, challenging puzzle game, this game tops that.",
