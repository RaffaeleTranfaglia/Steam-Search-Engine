            "review_text": "This game is terrifying in a primal, gutteral, mind-expanding kind of way. Don't play this before you go to sleep.   I'll fully admit I haven't plumbed every depth of this experience, but it goes places I could never have thought. Weird, dark, abject horror places. Places that will make you think about how you approach life.  This isn't a funny review. This is legit a mind-bengingly transformative experience.",

            "review_text": "Okay so first off I guess this review contains spoilers.  Secondly: SODA DRINKER PRO is not the actual game.  I kept playing thinking there was something to be found in the 'soda' levels, but there is none as far as I can tell. The art, audio, and gameplay is intetionally terrible, It's only purpose is to distract you from the actual game that can be found on level 2.  The actual game is something called Vivian Clark, a series of interesting mini-games with great music and great art.  I honestly haven't been this charmed by a game in awhile. Maybe it's just the juxtaposition from Soda Drinker, but the moment I got into the main game I was hooked. The games are quick, though a tad difficult to figure out at times, but once you figure them out they are very enjoyable. The art is goofy and colorful, and I believe at least part of it is hand drawn? Everyhting you do has an impact, even death is just a part of the cycle.  Hiding the main game within a 'joke' game was a risky move, and it seems that a lot of people aren't getting the joke, but honestly I really enjoyed it. Good game, and a great gift to prank someone with.",

            "review_text": "Never in my life has a game encouraged me so wholeheartedly to enjoy it without even trying.  I think that's the beauty with a game like this.   On paper, walking around drinking a virtual soda doesn't seem like much, but when you let yourself actually give it a chance you'll find that over 40 levels have already gone by, and you and your friends are anxiously anticipating what weird and interesting levels come next.  Video games at its core should always be about having fun, and if you are able to find the fun in drinking a simulated soda in places like the skate park or the moon then you will fall in love with this game.  Pros:  Huge Soundtrack - Each level has its own unique song Oculus Rift Support Vive Support (coming soon) Ultrawide Monitor Supported (tested with 3440 x 1440) 60fps achieveable even on low range PCs Over 100+ levels to drink sodas in  Hundreds of secrets and levels in hidden separate game inside Soda Drinker Pro Level Select after completing the game In-game Soda Customization  Cons:  No Leaderboards/Tournament Support currently Leaves you wishing there was simulated food to wash the soda down with ",
