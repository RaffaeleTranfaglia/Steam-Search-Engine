The interactivity wasn't perfect, and the physics could get a little buggy, but some of the things you could do with the controls were really innovative for the genre. I would definitely recommend this to any puzzle room / escape the room fans.",

            "review_text": "This is one of the best experiences I have had with a vr game in a while. It's fun, different, and an overall great time. The Film Noir style helps you keep immersion with the odd, but yet realistic puzzels. Each puzzel is well crafted and creative. They're not too hard, yet not easy and straight forward. Each one leades to another in a way which you are never stuck and you know where you should focus on next. At the time I was bought it other players and I ran into a small glitch where the mail shoot wasn't magnetic and wouldn't grab the pipes, but after a quick restart of the game it fixed itself and I was able to solve it. Other people are complaining the ending was odd and didn't match the style, but I quite liked it and was a 'satisfying' end. My only complant is the price, I think 10$ is too much for the 45 minutes (how long it took me) of gameplay, and I can not justify keeping it and never playing it again. That is why I returned it, and I hate to not support the creators and get a 'free pass,' but if they were to add another room I would gladly rebuy it and keep it.",
