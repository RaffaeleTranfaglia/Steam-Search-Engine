            "review_text": "-I play on another account and my game time is around 7 hrs there- Nice puzzle game with witty dialogue. Main puzzles are mostly moderate difficulty, game world is really peaceful with relaxing music. Question marks(bonus objectives) are a little bit harder and got me stuck sometimes. Other than main missions, there are payload mission stages with heavy action and combat which I haven't yet played much, they look fun but not my style. In overall, it is a good game to play after a long day :)",
