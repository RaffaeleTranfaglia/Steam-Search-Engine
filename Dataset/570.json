You race to the tree, and begin to open a beautiful present, adorned with festive colors and a wrapping scheme that is both dauntingly complex yet also simple in its execution. You turn to your mother, father, and two siblings and smile; for you know that your adventure into opening your gift is about to begin. You go to open your unwrapped box, and BWONG.. A horn bellows, deafening you. Out of the box pops a small, dwarf-like figure, wielding a multicultural bat festooned with Ecuadorian and Peruvian patterns, and of Russian construction. 'THANKS FOR STANDING STILL, GANKER,' he shrieks, as he wallops young brother Timmy in the teeth. Your mother tuts and scolds him, for being out of position. The dwarf darts under the tree, looking for a hole in the wall to continue his pursuit of rat-DOTA. 'Gank him, ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥!' your father roars, as he sits on the couch lazily and watches. You crawl, desperate for your gift of victory over the rat, under the tree, and he continues to elude you. Suddenly, with a flourish, he produces a lighter, and proceeds to methodically burn down your house while muttering 'GG 2 EZ', and your family sits in the living room muttering 'garbage team' and 'reported'. Your family home burns down around them, and only you escape the engulfing flames, accompanied by the chortles of the dwarf. Downtrodden but not easily bested, you begin your walk down the street to your friend's house, in the hopes that by having Christmas at their house, you might be able to somehow catch the multicultural dwarf on the second try.  10/10 Best fun and Peruvian simulator.",

There's no reason to play this unless you need a time sink that'll come around to having a measure of control of your life.

Because if you managed it, it'd make you feel better. What other games does your mood revolve around whether you play well, and how many other games can you name where you'd take that 'feeling good' to the point of willingly sacrificing an entire day to it?  Unless you've got a team of people to play with, and you don't care how much you suck, or you're actually a pro-gamer with an active team looking for a transition, don't waste your time. There's plenty of other things to do with literally 100+ days of your life.",

The trick to enjoying it though ? start playing with friends or people you know, make a plan, help your teammates, and CHOOSE A SUPPORT IF YOU SEE THERE ARE NONE ! and reach level 13 and you can play ranked matches, where the people are not much friendlier but will at least help you out.

            "review_text": "This brand new game by Riot puts a spin on the definition of 'Casual Gaming'. What consumers thought would be another fun and enjoyable experience for the family turned out to be much more. This game is called 'Dota 2' which is an acronym for 'Delicious Orange Teamwork Association 2', the sequel to the original DOTA.  DOTA 2 revolves around 2 teams of 5 players each (the perfect number for a happy family and maybe even a friend to all sit down on the couch and play together as a team) who are both trying to sell as many oranges as possible while sabotaging the enemy team's orange sales!  Gameplay is very casual and easy to pick up. You don't even have to play the tutorial if you don't want to! Just jump in the game, let everyone know you're new and start selling oranges!  Speaking of new players, those who are new to the DOTA universe might be a little discouraged by all the terms that more experienced players use, so I'll explain a few of them here.  -'Feeding' is when your team is selling oranges at a very fast rate. This is very good, so make sure you feed as much as possible! -'♥♥♥♥' is a term you may see thrown around a lot by players of this game. DOTA is a very popular game in Russia, because it is developed by a mysterious individual named 'Ice Man' who is from Russia! '♥♥♥♥' is a friendly term that roughly translates to 'Keep up the good work!' -'Report' When someone says 'Reported.' or 'Im going 2 report u!' that means that they are filling out a sales report on how well you've sold oranges! This is a fun way to keep track of how good you are at the game, and it's considered friendly to try to report the best players you see in a game, even if they're on the enemy team!  DOTA 2 has over fifty dozen players on at a time, so you better get playing now and become a veteran because before you know it, everyone and their grandmas will be playing the new nation-sweeping casual game DOTA 2!",

You picked another carry because it seemed logical? Well guess what, I got a few replays that will show crybabies throwing the game so you cant compete for thier spotlight.

The new HUD is completely ♥♥♥♥, so tiny you can't see abilities well or inventory items easily. Everything is dumbed down. Scanning enemy inventories for their items is also a disaster (need a microscope to see). Essential stats and other important information is hidden under tool tips which obstruct the screen when you hover over them.   The HUD is a critical part of playing Dota 2 and often a lot of time is spent looking at this, so the changes have a really detrimental effect on enjoyment.  On the right hand side of the screen there are kill pop ups and rune pick up notices blocking out your view 24/7. Minimap is ugly, coloured terribly and extremely small (can be re-sized but doesn't solve the other issues).   The new update genuinely makes me feel dizzy and unwell. My eyes/head hurt. It's a real pain both literally and figuratively.  That aside, the fact that there are now 4 bounty rune spawn locations makes the whole point of bounty runes futile. They used to be a luxury bonus for those who invested time in securing rune areas.  Nobody challenges rune spawns anymore early on, because two are safely on the dire team side of the map and the other two are safely on the radiant team side of the map. So bounties have simply become a meaningless chore to level up faster for each team.  Valve has cut down leveling in general so that it's easier and made adjustments to mimic the lame League of Legends MOBA. Most notable is the similar map design to LoL which is a complete ♥♥♥♥ing eyesore to play on and the ultimate system now being skilled at levels 6, 12 and 18.  Neutral creep camps are different, seemingly placed in any part of the map with no thinking. A number of winding paths intersecting each other in the jungle creates a maze for players to walk through with little strategy.  The new 'skills tree' system appears to have potential to work, but ultimately comes off as a cheap attempt at complexity when the game already had so much depth.  Overall, the feel of Dota 2 is very child-like now.  I cannot recommend this game in good conscience until major fixes are made.  4/10",

            "review_text": "Honest feedback / observations - Dota 2 - 7.00  I was watching the eg vs newbie game last night, and I've honestly never been that uninterested in a pro game, and this is coming from someone who really enjoys watching them, almost to the point of enjoying it more than playing .. It was hard to pinpoint one specific reason why I disliked the viewing experience, there are so many changes to this once great game it's really hard to put the feelings into plain text, its almost unrecognizable from previous versions. Nevertheless, I tried to honestly reflect on my thoughts and have covered some of the issues I've noticed and that the caster pointed out as well, see below.   At face value, and for me personally, the game seems to have generally lost what made it so special to begin with - it was different than the other MOBA's, it had its own unique identity and old school feel. I feel that this is due to the very gradual changes/improvements that patches have brought over the years, never straying too far from the core gameplay. Change is good and inevitable in many cases, but this isn't change, this is almost a new game. The game feels dumbed down/too easy in some respects (6x runes/talent trees/less emphasis on item progressions/item countering/arcady feel) but also too complicated in some respects (horrible pathing/lame fighting areas with too many stairs and jungle juke spots/extra towers in the jungles/small hud that fs up my focus/vital info being hidden or taken out completely etc etc etc). Basically what most people are saying on here is how I am feeling as well - if you're one of the people who puts their arms up and says go into more detail, please just ask, I would be happy to elaborate.   Now... The caster, who has been playing basically since dota inception (and was also once a beta tester for icefrogs patches) kept noting how terribly 'boring' the update is, and compared many of the changes to games like LOL/HOTS. I personally found it refreshing to hear someone with loads of experience break down some of the shortcomings of this new patch as not many high level dota players have as of yet (why would they bite the hand that feeds I guess). There were several specific points made as to why the new patch has fallen short and I wish I could remember exactly what all of his points were. Nevertheless, one thing that stood out was when the caster spoke about the new runes, which he disliked very much. This sort of sums up what he said: The new runes effectively force players to go to point X at time X, and if you don't you're missing out. It feels like a forced meta, and that there is now a very specific formula to the game that promotes less creativity. Support players can hangout in jungles to collect runes etc most of the early game, pick up their talent tree exp or gold bonus or w.e and then start 5 manning. In general, he felt that whoever has the better lineup tends to win, and thought that many games were effectively won or lost at the draft (obviously there's more to it but I thought it was an interesting statement). He also absolutely ripped into the new HUD - however i think most players tend to agree (even the ones who call out the 'whiners') that the HUD sucks and will most likely continue to be overhauled. He also mentioned that, although there is not much public outcry from the pros, that behind closed doors many of the pro players are extremely disappointed with the new direction of the game. He covered many other issues that I do not have the time/energy/memory to touch on but as you can tell..I care deeply for this game. I am not the type of person to come on forums to talk ♥♥♥♥/complain but I felt forced to in this case.. I have not abandoned the game yet as I think that is a premature knee jerk reaction, however, I am abstaining from the current state of the game until (I hope) changes are made.",

As far as most MOBAs are concerned, this one has a good blend of strategy and relfexes that rewards those who can use both to their advantage. The gameplay is, as a result, solid, and every sessions provides new opportunities for fun and strategy.  The UI is a little underpopulated, however, and doesn't explain much. learning how to do some of the functional things, like leaving a game that's safe to leave, or muting people, or reporting people, are not super intuitive: you have to dig. Furthermore, the options available, though very powerful and plentiful, are not explained super well. As a result, it's important to toy around with your settings a bit, which can be a hassle.  As far as the F2P model goes, it's pretty fair: you can play the whole game without needing any of the micro transactions. The only thing they do is customize your aethetics, and happily not to an extreme extent.   Because of this, the game has a really unified look despite all the different items your characters can wear. This might dissuade people from buying them, because some of the items are barely even visible.  Overall, I would recommend this game to anyone with a hankering for a challenge. The game is NOT easy, but it is worthwhile and a lot of fun once you get a hang of things. Veterans of the genre will find a lot to like.",

Thanks for taking me back to my League days and reminding me about the things I found in modern mobas that I hate. Dota was all about skill, strategy, and pacing. You're just dumbing it down like Blizzard did with WoW so you can mass market it more and make more money from the competitive scene. That's all this is, it isn't for the long term playerbase, it's for your wallet. League is all spamming and immediate gratification from success, or instant recovery from mistakes.  In Dota, if you waste a long cooldown ability, like a Ravage with a miss, you know you ♥♥♥♥ed up, your team knows you ♥♥♥♥ed up, and the other team knows when they drive down your mid lane forcing a fight or having you relinquish buildings while stalling to contest until your team is prepared to fight.  Now? The defending talent capped carry gives no ♥♥♥♥s because she can sweep a whole team by herself, even when the str initiator doesn't have his main team fight ability available to butt heads with the other team and give her space.  Yeah, you murdered Dota. You took a team game, and watered it down into a version where everyone is holding hands and it isn't a big deal to make a mistake, or a big deal to make a good play, because now there'll be a million decent plays and mistakes constantly, happening so fast and frequently that they aren't a big deal.  I'll probably continue to play occasionally until I find another game to pick up when I have spare time, but as of now I'll be ceasing any spending on DOTA and looking for a new past time to spend that money on. Today marks the day of the slow death of Dota for me.",

I'm still not sure how or why it happened but i do enjoy playing Dota and sometimes i even play vs people, even though it makes me want to cry or yell in rage.  There are few major issues with Dota 2 at the moment:  1) Absence of communication between developers and players. Dev forums seem to exist only for players, since thousands of bugs (especially cosmetic ones) and suggestions simply remain ignored.  2) Infrequent content updates and lack of features. They could've at least allowed us to play game modes from different events to diversify gameplay or added new maps, instead they keep focusing on adding new cosmetic items. 9 out of 10 updates only include 'hats'. Game folder keeps growing but nothing changes gameplay-wise. They even stopped adding new bots to my favourite game mode.  3) Constant server side issues which they can't fix. There are issues with downloading replays, reconnecting to games, watching matches, searching for games and even finishing matches without somebody getting crashes or disconnects.  4) A lot of racism, swearing and general anger towards other players. Especially Russians. Report system is completely inadequate and doesn't help at all.  I would recommend Dota 2 because its cute and well-thought game, with amazing voice-overs and excellent replayability. I do advise however against spending money in their store since once your start you cannot stop. This is probably how drug addiction works - they pull you in with free stuff and then you just want to complete a set, buy new items because of the modified effects, gamble for a chance to get some common item which would later cost hundreds of dollars (valve deliberately removes some items to drive up prices), find some unusual courier which could easily compensate all of your spendings... or plunge yourself into poverty if you get unlucky with chests.",

            "review_text": "I have been an avid Dota player since beta. With over 3000 games played and countless hours invested, I clearly enjoyed the game. I recently took a break after the International, due to the overhype that happens every year with it. I saw that 7.0 went live (didn't see that coming) and was excited to patch up and start my addiction all over again.   After playing a few nights since 7.0 release, I keep asking myself 'wtf is this?' I don't even know where to begin describing the absolute sh*tshow that this game has become. I find myself confused constantly, and not because of mechanics or UI, or items, or X...but the overall design that is the package of 7.0.   What is the vision? Who in the Hell is in charge of quality? What made them decide to make such drastic changes overnight? Why was there no narrative or rational explained behind this overhaul. Valve just vomited this poorly designed, extremely buggy, modge podge of randomly designed and bloated features onto live servers.   Lets start with the map changes. Why? Why bounty runes? Why relocaiton of rosh? Why change core mechanics on a whim? I tried multiple games to stack jungle camps and was maybe successful 5% of the time, trying at multiple iterations of early to mid 50 seconds. Rosh is on the other side of the map...right in the middle of the river..o.O? There are so many terrain changes now that I don't know how to ward properly and at this point in my time spent in the game...I don't want to relearn all of it.  The minimap will be your demise. Don't use it to flee frantically because the scaling is actually larger than the frame window and you will end up running face first into the enemy. On that note, when trying to launch something across map (like clockwerk's rocket) the actual trigger point is not in the center of the rectile, but the tip of the hidden mouse, which is the upper left hand of the bounding box. Nice bug there, that went live???  The pregame VS screen is atrocious. Particles flying at your face to reveal the two battling team compositions...with horrific shadow flickering, polygon tearing, and half of the heroes are so poorly framed that their face isn't even seen! What in the Hell is that all about?! Did you have some unpaid intern work on this loading screen?  Monkey King needs heavy tuning. Not even going to get into that f*cking mess of a hero. Dota 2 has not released a new hero that has never been released in Dota 1...until now...and its not even original or new. Yea yeah yeah I know he's been in talks for like a decade or something, but he's not new. He rolled out in League a long time ago and it just makes Valve look unoriginal and cliche. Oh cool new hero!....its a monkey...how lame. A monkey with an arcana, give me a f*cking break.  Seriously, at some point were there 10 random people in a room throwing darts at a wall to design this patch? Sadly, in 3 months from now..most of the bugs will still exist, new ones will be present, old features will still not be correctly implemented, and a year from now most of the stuff that was added in this patch will not be maintained properly and the game will be an even bigger mess than it is now. But who cares right? As long as people keep buying hats, pouring millions into overhyped tournaments, and fattening Gabe's wallet...why should they care?  Pre 7.0 = 8/10 Post 7.0 = 4/10  Don't waste your time, money, or effort. Go play a game designed by a team of people that have a vision and care about their product. Or don't, who gives a sh*t.  ",

Bought at Price:  $0 - Beta test  Put it this way, I have over a thousand hours in this title for a reason. Something always brings me back to it. It has even elapsed my hours in Counter-Strike somehow. What is it exactly that keeps bringing me back here?  First off, this game is of the 'MOBA' breed. It isn't an RTS, FPS, or even MMORPG. It's roots are from Warcraft III, and other RTS games. Someone brought these games out of the shadows and gave them an overhaul. You have probably heard about LoL, being League of Legends, the most direct competitor with Dota 2. Not getting into the whole thing, simply put, Dota 2 is more 'hardcore' and 'punishing' than League of Legends while still providing a fun and inviting atmosphere. This I can say with certainty because I have played both titles in their infency.  Valve is known for their work. There's obvious reasons for this. They don't scam you out of your money (*cough**cough*EA*cough**cough*), but rather let you spend money. Items are cosmetic, and you don't really have to participate in trading, collecting, or even buying anything in Dota 2. Just like Team Fortress 2, all items are random drops at the end of a game -- which can be from 20 minutes to 90 some odd minutes.  Just like other Valve games, they are best played with friends. Reasoning being that you know how they play, and they know how you play. Enjoyment can come from winning, but I think it comes more from a collective win, where everyone felt like they did something to win. This is more obivous in the matchmaking in ranked play. Unranked seems to be all over the place, but with ranked, you play with players of like skill. Plus this is the only game I can think of where pausing a multiplayer game works more than half the time.  Graphics aren't a huge thing here. They can be scaled down quite well, but be expected to run a reasonable setup. This isn't Half Life 1 or 2 in terms of system requirements. I've managed to get it running on my laptop which says something.  Overall, like I've said before, there's solid good reasons to play and continue playing Dota 2. Since the title is free, hop on and try it out.",

            "review_text": "Dota 2 is a multiplayer game (though you can play against bots). There are two teams of five players - the Radiant, and the Dire. Each player picks from a list of many characters, each with a different set of abilities. The two teams start on opposing sides of the map (there's only one map in the game). Each team has a base area, in which resides an 'Ancient'. From each base, creeps - these autonomous NPC creatures - spawn periodically in waves, and start a journey toward's the other teams base. Towers are scattered around the map that will automatically fire on any enemy unit.    The goal for each team is to destroy the other team's Ancient, while defending their own. Hence: Defense of the Ancients.  Sounds simple - but there's a lot more to it than this. Imagine the game starts and both teams just stay in their own base. Creeps from both teams will wander out from one base and head to the other, meeting somewhere in the middle of the map, where they will fight (again, they do this automatically without any player input). The creeps are evenly matched so typically they will both wipe each other out. The next wave of creeps will clean up anything left over - or they'll reach a tower, and get smashed by it - and the cycle will continue.    Basically, nothing will happen - the game will not end, because the creeps can't get anywhere. Now imagine just one player from one of the teams goes out with his creeps. He can attack the enemy creeps, and support his own creeps as they make their way across the map, knocking down towers along the way. Eventually, he'll get to the enemy Ancient, and be able to destroy it. But if just one enemy player comes out to meet him, the teams will be more evenly matched - and it comes down to a player versus player (PvP) scenario.  The PvP is, of course, the heart of the game. It is of a high level of complexity - the learning curve is quite steep, making it challenging for noobs, which is one of the reasons why the community was famed for being full of what I will euphemistically call 'short tempered people'. One player who doesn't know what he is doing can easily bring down the whole team.  The complexity comes from two main parts - first, the sheer number of selectable characters in the game. At the time of writing, there are 102 characters - with more added periodically as the game is updated. Each character has four different abilities (sometimes more) that are active (requiring the user to press something to make them go) or passive (they just operate automatically). The abilities are character-specific, though there are common elements between them. Some of the abilities require chaining to use them effectively, and each ability is leveled individually as your character earns experience.    After you've done the maths and figured out how many different abilities there are between all the characters - and thought about how long it would take to become familiar with even a small handful of them - consider that in addition to that, there are over 120 different items that you can equip your character with. Items can perform new actions or augment your existing ones (again, they are active or passive in nature).  Oh yeah - each game takes a long time to finish - around 45 minutes is pretty common. You will never get away with saying 'I'll just have a quick game of Dota' to your significant other - at least, not once they've put up with you playing it a few times.  So - learning curve. Big one. Time investment (or sink, if you prefer). Big one. Especially when you're trying to play with other people and they're abusing you for not knowing what you're doing. But the real question is - is it worth it?  I've clocked up almost 400 games (and there's still some characters I haven't played). I'm not turning pro any time soon, but have a reasonable handle on the fundamentals. My win rate is about 50%, which seems to be fairly normal. Losing is often traumatic, especially after you've lost a couple of long 45-60 minute games in a row, or you're saddled with random teammates in the matchmaking who are abusive idiots (or just bad).    But the games that are good - they're really good. With so many combinations and different ways to exploit them, the level of satisfaction when you're playing with friends and manage to co-ordinate a five-person push on a tower, laying down that perfect combo that takes advantage of all your abilities, wiping out the other team.... well, that's what keeps me coming back for more.  Not only that, but once you've invested a bunch of time and gotten over some initial learning humps, it's genuinely fun exploring the different characters and item combinations. There are always new builds to try and new items to buy. I've gone through several 'favourite characters', depending on which new ones I've played recently and how well they worked out with my natural play style and with my teammates. Even after around 400 hours of gametime, I still have more to explore.  I do, however, only really enjoy playing the game with my friends. I've tried a few games 'solo', just picking up teammates using the matchmaking service, and I find this massively less fun. It's less engaging because I typically don't like to communicate with randoms via voice, and your chances of picking up toxic players are increased. I've had good games with randoms, but generally don't bother playing unless my mates are online.    As with all reviews, this one attempts to help answer the question: 'should I buy this game?'. Well, good news - Dota 2 is free. It has just come out of a long invite-only beta period, so your actual financial investment in whether or not you should get into the game is zero. But there are two big questions you need to ask yourself:  1. Can I justify the amount of time I need to get decent at this game before I start enjoying it?  Make no mistake, the learning process for this game is An Ordeal. If you're prepared to spend many hours reading guides and playing with bots until you can beat them on a reasonable difficulty - maybe 10 games? - then that's a good start. If you've got mates that are happy to babysit you then that's good - but note that most of them will not want to do this because it almost certainly means they'll be losing (a lot) while you're still struggling with the basics.  The best way to approach it is to read some guides - I recommend Welcome to Dota, You Suck - and play with bots until you can beat them on Hard, reliably, with one character. Then find some friends who are happy to play with you knowing your noob status, and play some games online with them. The more friends the better; if you're matchmaking with randoms they will probably be less tolerant.  2. Why is it free? I seriously can play this without paying anything?  Dota 2 is built on the 'freemium' model. It's free to play, and you can purchase in-game items for money. By giving the game away, Valve hope to make more money selling in-game items than if they'd charged for the game. This is an increasing trend - so get used to seeing it more, especially for games with a strong network effect (i.e., anything with multiplayer).  The things you can buy for Dota 2 are basically adornments for the characters. For example, you can outfit them with new armour, or a new sword, or some new spell effects, that are different from the stock-standard one that they come with. You can get some of these for free - they'll randomly drop at the end of games - but the good ones for your preferred characters you'll have to shell out for.    It's very important to note that these items are purely decorative and have no impact on the gameplay at all. You can't pay money for a new sword that does more damage - it just looks different. This is critical and stops the game from becoming a silly pay-to-win thing. If you're a content creator, you can also create your own stuff and sell it in the store (splitting revenue with Valve).

However, they have so much in common: both sports offer healthy food for the mind, require the player to experience a serious tactical analysis and the ability of many moves ahead to predict the development of events. Unfortunately, in public opinion, Dota is not only devoid of these qualities, but seems to be the embodiment of Vice, evil, and Satan himself.  When a player all day playing hundreds of parties and studying tons of literature, this is called professional diligence. When the same is engaged in 'doterla' - 'secretscom'. Released in 2003 year card-modification for WarCraft 3 Defense of the Ancients broke the gaming community into two camps. For some, 'dot' was the pinnacle of the evolution of game making and lifestyle. Others look at it as the abode of vulgarity and bad taste, 'Dom-2' of the game world. But who would say that no, Dota has become one of the biggest eSports disciplines, being an appendage of WarCraft 3. The question of its transition into an independent game has been solved recently.",

However, I am brought here to say that this game no longer reflects the custom map we all used to enjoy so much. The developer (or Valve) changed how the game is played entirely. From the noticeable changes of the map to the small intricate details (such as hero stats, user interface, etc), Icefrog and valve decided it was a wonderful idea to completely change the game to be more similar to League of Legends / Heroes of the Storm to appeal the casual audience or maybe someone who may spectate one of the International tournaments every year. Sadly, the Dota we love is gone and is now taken over by people who want the wrong progress into a new game. I saw nothing terribly wrong with the old map or how the game used to be played. In the past, there would be balance changes to change up the strategies from those used in the previous patches. Now the game is entirely new and everyone basically sucks (except Monkey King hero pickers). The game is moving towards a strict metagame where a chosen few heroes will be spammed at tournaments, similarly to League of Legends. I do not want to continue supporting Valve in this transition and I hope you will also avoid playing this game until it is reverted.  Note: this isnt my main account, just wanted to re-iterate my sadness and disappointment",

            "review_text": "This game was one of the best MOBAs out there in my opinion. Key word 'was'. The most recent update, 7.00 completely changed everything for worse. The new character is ridiculously overpowered, the new map layout is horrible, the whole feel of the in-match shop and hud are not too bad, but not as good as they were before. The new character 'Monkey king', has an ability that lets him jump on to trees, and go from tree to tree without using any mana... he can turn into a tree, courier, and dropped items. While he is disguised, the towers dont attack him. I am seriously dissapointed. It makes me think, why did anyone think this was an ok hero to put in the game, or why anyone thought the new interface was worth it to change so much so that it ruins the feel of the game. Roshan is now just sitting in the middle of the river, was that really needed? The new shrines that are by the secret shop are just stupid. They give you more regen than the fountain does, why... just why... Overall, I'm very dissapointed with this update, and I'm hoping the new hero is nurfed A LOT, the roshan location is returned, and the shrines are no longer a thing. Also, I think the interface and HUD was made far worse than is was before, it could either be changed to actually feel like dota again, or just returned to normal. I would recommend the game before the update but after the update I wouldn't simply because of how ridiculous it feels now.",

Dota 2 developers should soon find something that will affect 1- Quitters, (intentional leavers) really bad. -10 bad conduct points 2-Disconnections should be punished. - 5 bad conduct points 3-AFK players - 7 bad condcut points 4-and flamers -3 bad conduct points 5-and the least , the noobs.

That will make a solution for smurf accounting and disorganized, no knowledge pub players. I dont mean being a rookie or not making support stuff should get you out public games but if someone does it usually, this has to cost him/her -1 bad conduct points.  -10 points in a time period should make you go for that many games you ruined for low prio.  I think that is FAIR.   ...all for the love of the community, we and my friends with at least 20 people will leave dota 2 in the next month and this summer if these changes doesn't take effect in game and my score for that game is 55 / 100 until they mnake the change.  by the way we are starting to play Paladins, Overwatch, heroes of The storm , Magic The gathering and other cooler games better than dota community.",

The game can be super fun with friends or competitive as much as you want it to be. I would be lying if I said there's no skill involved, there's plenty ranging from the basics all the way up to advanced knowledge. It's definitely not easy and there is a steep learning curve but overall the experience can be fun if you let it be.  The game has all the good old moba stuff... the usual if your familiar with the genre, but if your not that's okay it's good to learn new things. It's simple 1 map, 3 lanes, 3 towers on each team, 2 bases and it's 5v5. The roster of characters or heroes is roughly just over 100 so there's plenty to work with, each with their own skill set. You can practice coop or solo against bots or go head to head against real players, there's also competitive ranked matches too. The user interface is simple and easy to use, there's matchmaking for US, EU, ASIA &amp; AUS including a party system for friends. You have an inventory for items, which will mainly be for cosmetic items for heroes. There's even a watch tab for spectating matches, events etc. Settings are good and the game is optimized well for both beasty rigs or old computers. With the new addition of Dota 2 Reborn the game went from great to amazing. It's a complete overhaul, new user interface, engine, game modes, custom games (User created modes, similar to the arcade mode in StarCraft 2). It even comes with creation tools and source filmmaker like you would see in Team Fortress 2.  Now the bad stuff, first off the game won't be for everyone it's challenging and well there is pretty much a big learning curve but most are willing to get past that. The community is okay but for a game as big as this it's normal that you will find yourself running into people that don't help often or would rather put you down and you could guess what the end result is? New players don't feel the need to stick around for that. Most of the good stuff is behind ranked matches, so early on you will find yourself grinding bot matches... learning but I think reborn is trying to fix this for causal players with the new game modes and custom matches.  Dota 2 went from the most challenging moba on the market to the best moba.",

I started playing it because my friends convinced me, and because almost everybody in the forum I post on play this. So I started playing it both with my friends and solo. Today at the end of my very last match(which I lost) I realized that I have never had fun in this game. I mean, out of 900 hours I can only remember like, 7-8 really funny moments where I actually laughed.  Oh, the irony of fate, the very last laugh was in my very last match. I was Earthshaker top dire in lane with Warlock against Death Prophet and Batrider, we got first blood like 10 seconds after the 00:00 mark, I spotted DP warding our jungle, I used fissure to block her escape way and Warlock used Shadow Word. While we were AA her, she started to move left and right like she didn't know what to do, it looked like she was dancing, and it reminded me of that case of mass hysteria happening around the early XVI century in France, where several people started dancing uncontrollably for weeks until they died(yes I know, my interests are ♥♥♥♥ed up), and THAT actually made me laugh, THAT to me was a funny moment, not the quick first blood, not the 2 more kills we did on bat in the next couple of minutes (warlock got all of them btw) but the fact that DP started dancing while we were beating her up. This made me think a little, but only for a couple of seconds, there's a game to win here guys! Focus!  There's very little to say about what happened next, the typical things that usually happen in a bad, unranked, 0 MMR, trench ♥♥♥♥ tier match; me without blink until 25:00; our Drow disconnecting (and abandoned) cause of PC problems, Lina with Aghanim and no Meka; wards only for half match(I'm guilty of it too); we lost Roshan two times, over 20 kills of difference for the Radiants, Lina and Storm Spirit arguing with each other, calling names, your mama did this, your fatha did that, your sista lul ♥♥♥♥♥ don't evel let me start on that one, and so on.  At the very end of the match, we hid in the fountain waiting for them to FF GG WP EZ QQ M8S ecc, and in that moment, reading the argue between Lina and Storm, i asked myself some questions: Am i having fun? Is this game making me laugh? How many funny moments i can remember about this game? Is that normal that to me every single match i've done looks exactly the same as the others(lul of cuz yes u ♥♥♥♥ing &lt;2kh scum n00b)? The answers to the questions were: no, no, not even 10, i don't know.   In that instant, I realized that this game, to me, was just a gigantic waste of time. How many times have I actually enjoyed what was going on on screen? Why am I taking this so seriously? Why do I want to win so desperately? Why do my teammates want to win so desperately?  ...  How many times have I smiled while playing this game?  ...  These are not pro player matches we play, we are earning nothing from this, there's no need to yell at each other! This makes me sad. I've heard yelling my whole life, I play games because they help me forget about how life is hard, to relax and laugh at the hundreds and hundreds of funny, silly, nonsense moments this beautiful piece of software can gift me. Games really help me, they help me a lot. Please, guys, stop, don’t get mad, I’m serious! This is a game, right? Games are meant to be fun! Please stop arguing, we lost a videogame, it’s not the end of the world, next time you will win, we will all win :) and even if you don't, who cares! It’s just a videogame! Enjoy the little things you can get out of it! Remember DP dancing to death? Wasn't that fun? Remember Pudge denying himself after we wasted literally all we got at him? And then the Radiants team wiped us? Yes, we lost money and experience, but wasn't that kinda fun? Sorta fun? Even a little bit? Yes we lost this match but c’mon! Don't hide in the fountain! Let’s do something silly to them! Let’s annoy them! Storm, use your ulti to get near them and then immediately go back in the fountain!

Drumstick of the Albatross 2, co-designed by Gabe Newell and David 'Phreak' Turley, has everything: HUNDREDS of weapons to choose from, an ENORMOUS array of materials obtainable to build one's own home base, and THREE different unlockable character models. At the low price of $5.99 each, booster packs are an amazing addition, allowing one's character and mount to be personalized even further. But where DotA 2 really shines is in its gameplay. The tight control scheme, designed exclusively for the Steam controller, allows a seemingly seamless interface between man and machine--you ARE the character. The experience of battling with enemy mechs up-close and personal is unrivalled by any game, especially with the advanced mango physics. Overall, I would rate DotA 2 a 9.8/10 experience; its only flaw is the slight lack of purchasable, pay-to-win content that I usually rely on to make my gaming experiences successful. I'd love to see a DotA 3, especially if Zynga takes a note out of Blizzard's book and makes the game dozens of times easier for paying customers to succeed at PvP.",

He chose snowball heroes his MMR rose, there was a certain joy in his victories no matter how badly his team did. Then after long nights of 1v5 he thought to himself 'I wonder how it would be if i played with those other four russians' For a week he tried to help lead others into the light of smart plays, excelent ward placement, and proper item choices. He led by example keeping the games close through the mid-game. But when the late game struck and the enemies BKBs were built, the team he spent the past thirty minutes of his life guiding and supporting were not there. They were not there when the bottom rax fell, they were not there when the ward spotted the Radiant attempt on roshan's life, they were not there when the mid rax was taken, they were farming, chasing illusions and supports. When the time came. When the last set of rax seemed doomed to fall, they came. In came my four hard carries like the lost children of a single mother they came to defend my home from the void. They had spent so much time farming and leaving the fighting to me that they hadnt a clue how to fight together. the four of them died a horrible death, only killing a crystal maiden they saw on their way back to the base... Why do i tell you this tale? Because there is a moral to the story, never play a support to climb the MMR bracket. It only leaves you heart broken, and 25MMR less. 10/10 would Carry again. ",

Dota is not a game for the faint at heart and one should only attempt to play it if ready to lose; but losing the match isn't all you'll lose! When playing with friends you will find yourself constantly hating each other as you or your friend(s) ♥♥♥♥ up. You will latch onto that hate and it will consume you. If you can survive the hate and keep coming back though, you will soon emerge into a world of new found misery and sometimes joy, as you begin to learn the basics. You will start to win, while you remain to lose at the same time. Dota 2 is a game where the player never truly wins. The player is never truly good, they're only slightly better each and every time; and every time will be different, no matter how many hours you pour into the masochistic game, that is -- Dota 2.",

I bet Blizzard is kicking themselves over cause if they had picked this up before Valve did, they'd be making a whole lot more money. M.o.b.a. games are a trend these days and the original DotA was a game i really got into for years. I recently only started playing again and immediately i remembered how petty and elitist certain players are. Sometimes you don't even enjoy playing the game, sometimes you just play cause you wanna even up the losses from the last time you lost. This game makes you rage in ways you thought you never could. Ah but the feeling of crushing your enemies is a fair trade off, no?  Good graphics, gameplay hasn't changed that much, events are pretty cool, marketable items are nice too. If they do promotional tie-ins with certain games like how TF2 did (for rare items. other than that genuine master thief set.) that'd certainly make it more interesting. Pudge with a super meat boy outfit or maybe Sniper with a tf2 sniper set.  I give it an 8 out of 10. Play it if you don't mind getting flak from your teammates when you mess up one tiny bit. I'd play LoL but then its too cutesy for my taste. To each his own. ",

After about 3 matches you've seen it all- this is a painfully simple game that offers no challenge whatsoever. I have some suggestions to improve the gameplay at least twentyfold:  1. Introduce a loadout screen and killstreak perks, such as uavs and AC-130s, to reward hardcore junglers such as myself. 2. Have an in game marketplace, where in game gold can be purchased for bitcoins, at a ratio of 1:1. 3. Increase number of players per team to 16 for epic battles.",

Aeon of Strife, AOS, that's how we came to know games of its like.  Afterwards, Tides of Blood popularized the custom map variant and the original Dota and it's ilk *About 100 different or so versions of it* spammed the custom map channels. Until All Stars came in and swept the competitions.  Now we see Dota 2 here, nearly a decade later and I have to say...  It's even better than it was back then.  The balance now is impeccable (Not withstanding popular competitive picks), the community is friendlier (Than LoL or HoN's to say the least) and although more complex than its competitors, the game gives you everything from the start.  It's a difficult game to be sure, but as a RTS-RPG hybrid, it contains depths of strategy, tactical complexity, and split-second reflex gameplay that is sure to delight and impress any gamer.  Dota 2 is a highly polished e-sport designed to draw in and awe. Is it perfect? No. Is it good? You bet.  For those of you who don't know what Dota 2 is, Dota is a mobile online battle arena, otherwise known as MOBA. You control a singular hero and play in a team of five heroes, who's task is to protect their ancient (home base) all while laying siege to the enemy ancient. The team who destroys the opposing ancient, wins the game.   In conclusion, I highly recommend anyone to check this game out. You won't be disappointed.",

It was the 1st MOBA i had ever played, infact i had never even heard of the term MOBA before, (and for those who dont know it stands for Multiplayer Online Battle Arena)  First of all i was LUCKY i had friends who played this, and watched and got help from them as they played before even starting the game, as when landed into the thick of it, it is quite daunting. The tutorials are BLAH... until you actually get to the main gameplay tutorials, but no mention of custom build selection??? , this is another reason why some of my friends have just given up. From my experience, if you are a keen gamer STICK WITH IT. However if you value your life then give up now because it is very addictive, stressful and fun in the same sentence.  DOTA is a very tactical game, which is extremely fun, overwhelmingly addictive too and by knowing the basic fundamentals and working as a team and not being arrogant or being able to take advice you can have a great game. You dont have to be an absolute strategist to win, although it does help  The problem with this game is the community, and that is not the communitys problem, infact i blame the creators VALVE for not putting enough restrictions in place, and the restrictions they do put in place are ridiculous.  First of all you have to have a half decent machine to play this on standard settings ( i sometimes even have problems on lowest settings on this machine and my machine lives up to their MINIUMUM SPECS. That saying that the game is quite playable for the most time on their minimum specs, but it seems bugs do keep popping up that they just wont sort out  Also take the game as it is... free to play... and if anything happens just suck your gut in and relax.

DOTA is a TEAM game, however many times you will get landed with players who cannot play as a team, don't get the essence of DOTA in the same way you do, are absolutely rude and ignorant and arrogant. My advice after lots of headaches.... sod them, you are playing because you like to play, if you suck they dont help by screaming at you, and if you are dieing too often (and not intentionally feeding) then it is their fault for not working as a team and protecting you.  Also matchmaking, you will find when you get into the game servers.... english speakers take off everything except us east, west and europe west and set language preference as english. This wont stop you being annoyingly teamed with people who dont speak english, but it sure helps... for some reason people dont understand communication is fundamental for a team game and selfishly pick servers where the know they will be teamed up with people who dont speak their languages. YES I AM SPEAKING TO ALL YOU RUSSIANS WHO SELECT EVERYTHING OTHER THAN RUSSIA.  Other problems are that with the report system or restrictions. Now people with low end computer who get annoying bugs ingame which randomly kick them off suffer most. However it goes for everyone on the report system. I rarely use it anymore because it does jack ♥♥♥♥ unless you are with a group of people you know will report the same person for the same actions. You get 3 a week no matter how much you play, which is dreadful, and you only get a report back if action is taken against someone, which seems to me it doesnt matter what they have done, if noone else reports it there is no check and they get away scott free.

When the games didnt load it was a pain in the ♥♥♥ and you may have to search another 3 - 10 mins for a game, but that was an annoyance i could live with. Now on the odd occasion i fail to load i get penalised for half an hour from finding ANY game, except ones with bots, remember failing to load does not effect the game as the game hasnt currently started, and it is annoying but getting a ban from finding a match for 30 mins (i even got an hour at one instance) is ridiculous, taking in account that a game lasts between 30 and 60 mins on average. that means sometimes when you only have a set ammount of time to play you are screwed.  [Bugs ive experienced taken out since they dont appear anymore on new laptop upgrade]  Other than that this game is the most fun game i've ever played, and so rewarding so no matter how crap valve are, or no matter how annoying the game can be at times, i alway come back for more.

            "review_text": "It is gravely unfortunate that I now find myself unable to recommend this game, but alas, it is what it has come to.   Dota 2 was once unique in that unlike many of the MOBAs, one had to work with a scarce amount of resources and manipulate said resources intelligently in such a way that would give them the advantage over their enemies. Many aspects, such as spell cooldowns, spell vamprism, and even respawning time reduction, could not be changed by any means, and set all heroes upon equal ground. One could not freely return to base unless they had spend some of their gold at certain locations, and only in the base could one regenerate the health of the entire team.  However, with the recent update, patch 7.00, the New Journey update, all of this has changed. A talent tree system that grants statistics simply by reaching certain levels (which is different from the ability upgrade system, mind you) combined with an item system reduces the incentive for acquiring the latter; every few minutes, certain reservoirs within the jungle allow ones team to simply rejuvinate health without spending time or wealth; nearly any statistic can be manipulated, like any other MOBA, and allow those ahead to exploit the power of their abilities further, especially considering that some heroes can manipulate different statistics more than others. Even the aesthetic of the interface has changed to something minimalist and flat from the formerly artistic, unique, depth-filled style you currently see in the preview images above.  Although some of you may not see these changes as too harmful or drastic, they are indeed something that drives the game a fair distance away from the unique experience it gave. For those of you that hail from other games of its genre, know that, a few nuances barred, it has become a game like any other, although with a severe case of balancing issues. It is currently in a fetal state, having been unborn and Reborn once again before it had fully formed. I had seen this game flourish for two years. Others have been with it for its twelve year lifetime. Many of both types now believe the game deeply scarred from the beauty of what it once was, and now look upon it as a mediocre work.   If you do not mind the tumult of imbalance and the groan-worthy humdrum of yet another modern MOBAs array of gameplay mechanics, then enter with a wish for good luck.  However, if you mind a deep sense of flaw within your games and seek something more refined, balanced, and pretty to experience, waste not your time with this half-born, ill predecessor of its former self and look elsewhere. I find Hi-Rez's SMITE to be rather nice nowadays.",

Dota 2 is definitely one of the best games of this generation, and I'm certain it will remain as popular and as influnencal for many years to come.  Graphics: 8.5/10 Very pretty, the art direction in DotA 2 is one of the best. The source engine ensures you can run it on anything more powerful than a toaster, and have it look great too. Cosmetics look great, and fit perfectly, with some exceptions,(I'm looking at you Alpine Ursa) but many stay true to the heros artstyle.   Sound: 9.5/10 All heros have a multitude of voice lines,and some even respond to one another (e.g Tidehunters hatred for Kunnka). If you find the default anouncer not too flash, theres a huge variety of optional packs, from the smoth talking Narrator from bastion, to the harsh condescending tone of Pyrion Flax.   Gameplay: 10/10 The big one. Theres a reason DotA Allstars got so popular, not just from the incredible passsion from the community, or the dedication of IceFrog and co., but from the incredible gameplay that spawned one of gamings most popular genres. From perfectly co-ordinating a fountain hook, to getting stuck on top of a cliff accidentally as Storm Spirit, no other genre rivals DotA 2 outstanding strategic gameplay and near-vertical learning curve. At the time of writing, I have 7,469 hours played and I've only just scratched the surface in the combos, stratagy and 107 availble heros to use, it takes year of hard work, dedication and passion to become truly great at the strategical masterpeice that is Dota 2.  - beardATTACK @ fren",

You can customize the appearance of all the heroes and it does not affect the balance of the game and I find collecting cosmetic items to be quite fun. If you are into trading you can make a ton of money (steam wallet funds) playing this game. Pretty much all my steam games come from profits from cosmetic DotA 2 item trading.

I could describe Dota 2 as a fast-learning curve not easy to master, I mean that everyone could start playing this game, but a little of them can reach high-level. Valve tries to satisfy the whole community adding a matchmaking that tracks your statistic and helps to find the right match for you, but sometimes match could be frustrating thanks to community; the major issues with Dota 2 is the not region-locked matchmaking, this could make teams that, due to language misunderstanding, won't cooperate. In my opinion loking the regions isn't the better way to fix this issues beacuse players should have the possibility to match worldwide to improve their skill, rather I prefer a team region-locked or, better, language-locked. Gameplay speaking is way better than other MOBAs, less user-friendly and more competitive; last-hitting mechanics allow team to focus on single hero that will be useful in late game, otherwise denies mechanics allow to counter enemy heros' growing. The hero pool is unlocked by default, so you can choose the right hero to counter enemy team. Valve is trying to set a new standard for e-sport investing a lot of money on it, we have just to support it by playing the game and following the growing e-sport scene, this will grant hours of fun.

The most important part, the matchmaking, is utterly horrible and doesn't deliver. Also its is so non-transparent that its impossible to know anything about your game before hand. Valve doesn't seem to care about this which is very problematic.

It can be really good when you are stressed out, as it can easily distract you. There are also some bad things about it. For example, people rage and flame too much. The worst thing that can happen to you in Dota is when all players in the game are flaming you. You will be come angrier when playing this game. Don't get me wrong, there are people who play Dota and don't flame or rage. Finding these people can be hard, therefore I suggest playing with friends. Dota can make you happy, you can have a good laugh while playing it. Remember, if you are already angry and raging too much in the game, go make a pause and come back later.",

The Aegis is used to reincarnate if you should die within about six minutes after Roshan is killed. The regular mechanics are similar to other Mobas, farming, shopping, leveling, skilling and pushing. There are some advanced mechanics like denying and stacking though. There is much more to tell about the game, but I am a lazy dude. You should definitely give it a try.",

            "review_text": "''Is DotA2 a fun game?' is usually the first question people ask about this game. Great games in recent times seem to often have set themselves apart from other games by being an 'experience game'– as an example Proteus is 100% experience and very little game. Braid was great because it was an innovative platformer but some of the greatest lasting attraction I felt to the game was because of the endearing story and symbolism that was symbiotic to the music and art of the game.   DotA 2 is not a game that tries to make it as easy as possible to 'experience' the game and then be done with it, unlike the set of games that have defined themselves a new genre in run of the mill First Person Shooters which make it as easy as possible for new players to complete sections of it and reach great heights in an attempt to lower the dominance new players have through tricks like fast healing, killstreaks and fast respawns. It doesn't fit with Half Life 2 like games in being a great singleplayer experience which you run through like a roller-coaster ride either: each game starts out the same but can diverge in an incalculable number of ways due to the enormous number of variables innate in the vast number of heroes and builds.  DotA 2 is a game; a game with rules and learning and practising; a game where you can't see the top of the skill ladder from the middle, a game that is challenging and intriguing at every turn.   What is it that makes a game fun? I don't think anyone knows the true formula, but we know that fun activates the reward centres of the brain. DotA 2 will give you the rulebook and some practise scenarios, but you cannot expect to have it play itself. You must teach yourself the game and through your endeavours you will get noticeably better each time and you can and will feel proud of it. DotA 2 challenges both the intellect and the reflexes with battles between an enormous range of heroes each with interesting, astoundingly well thought out and developed move-sets and characters. Because of the sheer challenge and complexity of what DotA 2 provides, it is a very fulfilling game with much room for growth; it is a game that will be enjoyable, I expect for a very long time.  Because of this, DotA 2 is not a game that is inherently fun– in as much as you can't pick up a pack of cards for the first time and expect to play poker.  But we have touched only on the mechanics of the game: DotA 2 takes place on a very beautiful map, complete with birds and squirrels, fish and butterflies, spiders and cobwebs, day and night; and forests and ravines. In honesty, all it would require for me to feel its atmosphere was perfectly polished would be weather effects– it would be wonderful to see rain splashing in the river, or even little streams!  The game has over 100 heroes, each memorable, with well-developed movesets, storylines and copious amount of character-to-character dialogue which allow the game's endearing heroes to cater to a huge variety of playstyles.  Overall, DotA 2 is a game that is not made to take Game of the Year one year, then fade into obscurity as people complete it, it's a game that sits in that category of games that you go to to have fun with some friends, it's a game that wants you to keep coming back to it and you know in years time you can still pick up the cards and have fun again.  If you want to pick up DotA 2, which, I should again emphasise requires some self-investment– I suggest you ask a friend to introduce you one-on-one to the game's concepts with passive bots, then practise with bots, trying characters until you find one you like and are good at. Progressing to be able to beat the hard bots with little difficulty is very good preparation for multiplayer. Then, all get on mic and play an online game, you'll win or at least have fun if you co-operate.' - Zemnmez 2k13",

Ok so dont be turned away by the huge learning curve, when you start you will be TERRIBLE but thats ok and likely you may never be great but you will make amazing friends and have so much fun. Actually I wish i could go back to being a blissfully ignorant noob because learning hero's abilities, what certain items do, lane compesitions, ect I can go on forever about how much there is to learn even after 2.5k hours (probably 1.5k - 2k hours actually playing) I'm still learning!  The game hits an odd paradox it can be the most satisfying and exciting game I've ever played but also the most enraging and frustrating, its a ♥♥♥♥ing emotional roller coaster sometimes. There will be highs there will be lows from amazing comebacks, to terrible throws, great teamwork, and Brazilian ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ feeders. I've even tried giving up after long agonizing losing streaks but nothing, no other game can quite fill hole not playing this game for a few hours a day leaves. Its perfect for me, I love being social, competitive, passionate, and excited all maybe too much at times but thats just the kind of person I am. Some of my best friends I've made playing dota with and even though I've never meet most of them I love them all and noting can quite compare to queueing for a ranked captains mode game with a 5 stack.  Valve is an amazing company and I'm glad they took the game and ran with it. Were constantly getting new seasonal events, heros, game modes, and more cosmetic items I can throw my money at. Oh and one of the best parts, all the heros are free and unlocked from the start! No progression system where you can buy characters with in game currency or level up some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t passives in a skill tree or something (like a certain game). You don't need to spend a dime but I strongly suggest you should considering your funding not only the people who make the game but the cosmetics are created by the community who they pay! Also all the items are tradeable, I’ve spent countless hours browsing trading sites looking to swap my items that I got for free as random drops for my favorite heros new hat or whatever. I’ve spent way too much time watching pro games as well which Valve fully embraces, they even host one of the biggest e-sport tournaments ever every year called The International.  I put a good bit of time into writing this review so thanks for reading it all if this even gets one person to give it a try then its not time wasted. I hope you enjoy the game half as much as I do.",

If this thing exists, please ignore that part of the comment, because I must say, I'm a little lost in the interfaces yet.  Otherwise the game is to be congratulated .I played LoL for a couple of weeks and I must say, and even with the punishment system, generally players were very rude there. Not to mention that it is a more recent game , while playing Dota I realized that many characters there are similar to here . Almost like a copy ... What I liked is that it is also much more complex, it requires more attention from the player . LoL it seemed like a light version of DotA.

            "review_text": "  This is my story of Dota 2.    My brother gave me a copy of it when the game was paid, he had loads. I watched some tutorials, l found one with Pudge. I played as Pudge, for my first character. Then as Shadow Fiend. I kept playing untill l got bored, at early stage it was ok. I didn't play it for like a few months. Went back on and started playing. About 9 months later l went back on. The game was MUCH more diffirent then and l hope it will keep changing and expanding as it is now. Right now l keep playing it daily doing challenges etc.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    So what is this game? and how dose it make it better than League of Legends?     This game is a MOBA. Well l get asked this question alot by my friends, is it better than LoL, Honestly l think yes it is, buy LoL is more comixy and diffierent gameplay. I played both of these games a fair amount and honestly l prefer Dota 2 than any other MOBA. But whats better about it? well, l would say its a bit harder than LoL (many people will not agree with me) and the gameplay is more free open, while LoL has a feeling of being squished, or sitting in a small room moving around. But Dota 2 is just a very unique game. You may not even play the game but collect items, what can l say, everything makes it better than LoL. Trading , finding items , etc. What l do like about LoL more is the creeps, in Dota 2 they look litterly like 'creeps'. But thats just because l like comixy more. Also, l recommend taking strectes after each game.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    So what do l do in this game?    Well long story short, It is a 5v5 game. You start of on a tutorial and after that you play in Match Making. There is diffirent modes in it such as All Pick , All Random , Ability Dwarft and more. l'll explain all three of them below.    All Pick       5v5 Each team picks any player from a BIG list of characters. Support, Nuker, Carry, ETC.       All Random       The name explains it all, 5v5 All random heros. You can repick to get another random one.       Ability Dwarft       This is recommended for experienced players. 5v5 random characters. Out of all the random characters all the abilites go in 3 squares and an line at the bottom. Each player gets 4 picks. You can pick 3 abilites and one Ultimate (your forth ability)     -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    So, recommendation time.      Pros    Fun game, not too repetetive. Many OP characters. (e.g Ursa,Riki) Many annoying characters. (Disablers) Usally extreamly fun map. Recommended to play with friends.    Noobs    Fun, but hard. Repetetive. Alot of cool characters. Unknown abilites. ( I recommend using in-game guides due to many people not knowing what abilites to upgrade or what items to buy)   So as my rating for this game (finally) l think the dev's are good due to very good daily updates. And requested fixes.  I rate this game 9/10    Thanks for reading this if you did. it took me approx. 45minutes to write. I hope you decided on getting this game!   ",

The game is an incredible amount of strategy, and you have to find the comatible hero for you, such as Axe, a powerful brute who is great for those who like heavy damage heroes. Sniper, (who everyone will ALWAYS try to murder even at the start) who is a very good ranged unit whos ranged attack can get very high. Then there's Riki who can become invisible, and hit the enemy from behind, while regenerating health much quicker. All of these characters allows diverse ways of strategy between the teams, and this is also how you win. Dota 2 should be a 6 star game, and is just wonderfully amazing. The ONLY problem I've had is that when I've been in low priority matches, everyone abandons and I don't get my matches down, even with the completion of the game (which I do).",

You are going to die alot and probably yell at your team mates but that's just the nature of this game. Dota 2 takes place in an arena where you will fight to destory the enemies Anicent if you destory it; you win.  The Ancient is protected by 11 stuctures called towers that protect it. Each of these towers are found in each of the three lanes bottom, middle and top. You take control of a unit that is a hero, many of them are diverse and have a lot of pros and cons such as Crystal Maiden who is really good at locking down heros early game with her stun but she is also the slowest hero in the game.   You are accompanied by 4 other players including yourself to fight against another 5 players. You need to push lanes to be able to destory the enemy towers in each lane but the catch is the enemy team is doing the same thing, so you need to not only push to your victory but to stop the enemy team from pushing aswell.   There is 107 heros in Dota 2 out of the 112 heroes that are in the Warcraft III. They are categorised into 3 groups. Strenght, which are usually the tanky guys. Agility, most carries are found in this category and Intelligence which most of the supports are usually found. All these heroes have different skill levels,  You can customise your Dota experience with annoucer packs which change the voice of the annoucer which include Glados and the narrator from the Stanley Parable. You can change your HUD to different themes example Familiar Woods dat just like Furion / Nature's Prophet world.  i know Dota 2 is a hard game because dota 2 always update patch and getting further, but Dota 2 is a nice game to play it to spare away your angry or bored something like dat...",

Don't be afraid to ask players for help and watch videos, watch TONS of videos. Read guides and builds, and experiment with every hero in bot matches. Go to the Library in-game and read up on every hero and item. Don't skip the tutorials! They may seem boring or dry at first but they really, really useful. This game can be extremely fun, and so fulfilling when you play it. There will be games that your team gets stomped with a 74-16 game....don't worry about it. There will be other games where the entire game is tied and both team have the same amount of towers down and neither team can get ahead, and it reaches over an hour. When it does finally end, whether you won or lost, it won't matter because both teams realize it could have went either way and that is was a truly amazing game. It is moments like that when you are congratulating the other team on a good game, not just because it is expected of you, but because it really was a great game. This is why you need to stick it out in the beginning and keep on trying. More than likely you will start out with a 2-17-4 score, but that's ok! Because in no time you will have that game, the game where your team worked together amazing and your hero was a perfect counter to their entire team and you'll get that 44-6-12 game.  As far as the gameplay is, Valve is very good about fixing the bugs. Most bugs are only on for a few days before a fix has come out. The game is very stable. The only problems I could have with Dota 2 are with the servers. There have been server issues and sometimes it causes you to have an abandon which wasn't fair, but non reversible. Also, there are issues if setting your language preference to English and you get paired with players who don't know any English, this can get frustrating.  All in all, Dota 2 is well worth the hours put into it and the best part is it is completely free to play. You don't have to pay a dime for any content whatsoever. The only thing that costs money is to customize your experience while playing, including Cosmetics, HUDs, Loading Screens, etc.",

            "review_text": "The satisfaction is incredible, playing every game to game having a great time is just ... amazing. Always constantly active and never getting bored.   Most of the negative reviews are written just because people get angry/rage (including myself) since it's such a competitive game, I know its 'only just a game' but, this game is revolved around teamwork and if your team dont co-operate you will probably lose.  But lets anaylse why I have changed from a positive to a negative review. *EDIT* Changed back into positive.  The game has a few downsides such as public matchmaking and the MMR system, In public games where you get matched up with people with 200 games played whereas you may have 1000 games played (which is a very big gap) literally is detrimental to your game, most likely you will lose because the player is not as skilled as you are.   A big ♥♥♥♥ing mistake that I feel is ruining my DotA experience is my MMR - a ranking system which determines where you are placed based on skill. Low MMR is about 3k below, medium is about 3k - 5k, high is 5k+ #ProLyfeRuffLyfe. Based on my friends decision they told me as a player is decent at the game and should be able to hit 4k, when i was around my 400th win I thought I was pro and decided to calibrate - I was a ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥. I calibrated to around 2.4k which is an absolute ♥♥♥♥ MMR and right now I'm way better. 'So why can't you just carry games because how skilled you are?' Well here is the problem. I know people have bad games and you can just accept it and try to help them and move on. BUT HERE IS THE ♥♥♥♥ING PROBLEM. I decided to play some ranked games, first 40~ or so games was a sucess I carried most games - team was okay, listened and communicated. I got to around 3.2k not bad for a month play. I come back after summer refreshed and decided to play before the International update. MY ♥♥♥♥ING GOD - THIS GAME THREW ITSELF IN THE TRASH. ♥♥♥♥ing every single game - mid leshrac, mid storm, mid mid mid mid. These heroes were unbalanced as ♥♥♥♥ and it took them about 3 months to update this game, next thing you know REBORN *will get into that later* then games just were ruined. I was on an 18~ loss streak back to like 2.8k and was stuck in this *Trench* forever, these few updates have ruined the game. I'm still stuck in 2.8k and trying to make a smurf to get to 4k. During my 18~ loss most of my games were me going positive and the rest of my team going negative not because they were unskilled but because of the meta/heroes that were being picked. I know you can counter pick - but no hero can counter 1vs5 - this resulted in teams feeding, quicker games, and overall a ganking ganking flamming kind of game with no chance of comeback.   Recent changes such as Reborn client as well as custom games have dropped quite a few players, right now meta is unbareable, rushed games, ganks only, nerfed creep gold, no item changes - the game isn't in a great state right now - thus why this review has been updated. It's been almost a full year since i've written this review and many updates have been made but, honestly, this game is going downhill, I've actually switched to LOL and find that there are always updates (usually 2 weeks) and they actually update what needs to be nerfed and what needs to be buffed. Constantly, items and heroes are always being changed, special events being added regularly *Giff Diretide* - well no more, some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t custom game called Haunted Colleseum. I used to love DotA but right now not so much, when valve as a whole decide to update their games regularly I may comeback but right now with a recent change to Cs:GO adding a broken revolver shows how much Valve as a whole are slacking right now so who knows when these changes will start to happen.  *MASSIVE EDIT* Well then, balance of power update released. I am amazed at what valve has done. However MMR thing still bothers me but now the game for once actually feels *balanced*. I am throughly enjoying the new heroes games feel winnable again, pulled a sick comeback from 0-23 to 42-35 the other day, games feel like they are lasting the approprate time, gold gain feels good. (Midas feels broken) The new Arc Warden is pretty legit if i might say - great creative choices. Right now Valve has outdown themselves just in time for the christmas holidays. This game is actually becomming a great game that I'll always love forever. Thanks, IceFrog - for everything. DotA&gt;LOL  On the other hand some positives.  This game has a very steep learning curve by nature and may take a while to get used to but once you learn all the mechanics the game is quite easy. Only way to improve after that is just improving individual ability and learning the game mechanics. You feel a sense of acomplishement when you win a game, all that hardwork and skill pays off. THAT FEEL IS SOMETHING YOU NEVER FEEL - IT JUST FEELS SO GOOD WHEN YOU CARRY A GAME 21-3 WITH LINA MID *KreyGasm*  But anyway,Dota is a really enjoyable game and I recommend it to people with time and the compassion to play as well as to take massive amounts of time into a game. DotA will always be an enjoyable game and will always be the game that I will love and forever play - when its updated.  I've also met a friend in Dota that I eventually met in real life and he is a good friend. I alway play with him and we have tons of fun. Not only is it a fun game but you can meet new people playing the game you love and enjoy.  Good luck have fun, go and rekt noobs :d2invoker:",

I could describe Dota 2 as a fast-learning curve not easy to master, I mean that everyone could start playing this game, but a little of them can reach high-level. Valve tries to satisfy the whole community adding a matchmaking that tracks your statistic and helps to find the right match for you, but sometimes match could be frustrating thanks to community; the major issues with Dota 2 is the not region-locked matchmaking, this could make teams that, due to language misunderstanding, won't cooperate. In my opinion loking the regions isn't the better way to fix this issues beacuse players should have the possibility to match worldwide to improve their skill, rather I prefer a team region-locked or, better, language-locked. Gameplay speaking is way better than other MOBAs, less user-friendly and more competitive; last-hitting mechanics allow team to focus on single hero that will be useful in late game, otherwise denies mechanics allow to counter enemy heros' growing. The hero pool is unlocked by default, so you can choose the right hero to counter enemy team. Valve is trying to set a new standard for e-sport investing a lot of money on it, we have just to support it by playing the game and following the growing e-sport scene, this will grant hours of fun. I almost forgive... it's FREE.",

Since I've been playing dota I've learned to speak russian and spanish, Who needs rosetta stone when you have dota right? The russians are so friendly and have a neat little nickname for americans called 'Suukah', I think it means comrade or friend. And the peruvians are so helpful, for instance I was mid as pudge and at the start of the match a peruvian dazzle came mid with me and stayed with for about 11 minutes, He helped me out by taking the last hits and first blood. He said 'movimiento ♥♥♥♥', I think it means 'I got your back', What a nice guy. Dota is great and all but there are a few problems with some heros, like bloodseeker, Phantom Assassin, Faceless void, And huskar. They need to be buffed, I find them extrememly underwhelmed. Bloodseekers ult cd is just too long and needs to be lowered to ten seconds, Phantom assassin needs a higher crit ratio, faceless needs more evasion and movement speed, and huskar's flaming spear should cost no hp. Oh and there's one other hero needs to be nerfed hard, Bat rider is just too overpowered and unbalanced. I think he has too much hp, and the base should be lowered to 320, also lower his base movement speed to 200. Aside from those few problems dota 2 is the best FPS I have ever played in my life.

Sure there are some unbalanced heroes and items. Sure there's the occaisonal right ♥♥♥♥, but if you are going to play a game that has near constant connection to the untamed internet and its hordes of demonic flamers and trolls, your gonna have to walk over that bridge, wether the troll likes it or not. The artstyle is appealing to the eye and the combat is vibrant with epic style animations and effects. Don't get me wrong, the Combat FEELS Good, but it LOOKS even better. There is no Pay-To-Win, which is what makes this a real 1# Place titel for me. The HUD Is Grounded in what works and has none of what doesnt. There's even a little tutorial to explain the base game mechanics (with the exeption of runes and items). Overall, the game left me impressed and a few few cents short after those beautiful visual clothing sets i bought (just a few, I Swear) What i'm trying to say is that youre experience with this game is what you make of it.

It's a bad game, a cluster♥♥♥♥ of story and characterization that isn't very well done by any aspect, but which attempts to compensate for its weaknesses by adding in excessive waifu ♥♥♥♥♥♥ry and DARKNESS. The normal gamer can see this as the ♥♥♥♥ it is, and may enjoy it, hate it or be indifferent to it, but all the while recognizing that the game itself, regardless of their opinion, is plain bad.  However, these very aspects that try to smear over the ♥♥♥♥ of its core make it a breeding ground for aspie, unsociable underageb&amp; ♥♥♥♥♥♥s who engage in every kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ry both online and in the real world. The superpowered characters all trying their hardest to look cool, the abilities, peculiar, colorful clothes, the whole hero ♥♥♥♥♥♥ry and everything about the Dota world fuels their escapist fantasies, while the pity-party character backgrounds, emphasis on revenge, and overall preachiness of the game make it fit just right with the mary-sueish drives of your average preteen and his sense of unwarranted self-importance towards the world. Exactly the kind of ♥♥♥♥ that makes little kiddies and underageb&amp; ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ eat this ♥♥♥♥ right the ♥♥♥♥ up.  Dota is basically THE series to attract the most hated game fanbase known to steam, which is why, regardless of individual opinions, it is the responsibility of every gamer to troll the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game and everyone who likes it, and ensure that no Dota threads ever encourage the newfriends to show their faces here.

However that doesn't stop the game from being fun, unless you're unlucky and end up with a couple of raging russians telling you to... ...well if I knew russian I probably would've known. So, how is this game good enough for people to play it even though the community is crap? Because it's simply amazing and well balanced. There might be a few heroes that could use some tweaking, but I wouldn't call them overpowered. The graphics are pretty nice and the lightning is really good honestly. Also, something good is that I've never met a hacker (as far as I know), even though at the time of writing I've played about 325 hours. This game does contain IAPs (obiviously), however, none of them give you any in-game bonus, all are cosmetics for your hero or HUD etc.   So, should you download Dota 2? I'd say yes, it's a great game with a few minor bugs but nothing that should affect gameplay or bother you.  If you decide to download it I strongly recommend you to play the tutorial.  It is kinda strange and isn't on the normal Dota map but it teaches you the basics pretty good.  This has been fixed with reborn, it now offers 'guided bot matches' which are much better.  Pros: + Nice graphics + Great settings menu + Good amount of graphics settings + Balanced heros  + Insanely fun with nice teammates/friends + Free to play but not pay to win (all items are purely cosmetic) + There are some really nice announcers if you're tired of the default one (they're paid though) + There are also music packs if you're tired of the default music (also paid) + Many items can be purchased cheaper on the Steam community market + SOURCE 2! + Custom gamemodes + Matchmaking for custom gamemodes is really fast + Fast tab-ing out/in (even with fullscreen)  Cons: - Community is, like with almost all competetive free games, ♥♥♥♥ - Russians who only speak russian - Russians who speak english yet they speak russian - Matchmaking can take a while  - You really notice how old the Source 1 engine is (it's soon getting replaced with Source 2 though) - Seems to have problems with some ATI/AMD graphics cards (minor problems though, nothing gamebreaking, seems to have been fixed with Source 2 too)",

The map, the talents we can get used to it pretty fast, after few matches, but it is still bad. The UI and the HUD was the biggest mistake ever. Unclear, small, basically unfit to reach its purposes.  More vision of the map still could be done with the old, by cutting the 'skin' part near the portrait. Its actually more fits to the 'Reborn'...while the game actually dying.  The Talent system is okay in case if you wanted to create some unbalanced heroes. I own you a thanks by robbing me by 79 items in my inventory. You know guys I used to collect Loading Screens,like many other players I guess. Thoose arts are beautiful when you heading into a battle, its really gives the spirit. BUT with this update, there is no place for them, they became useless :, ) Thanks. The Dota uniqe system, atmosphere Intelligence-Agility-Strength resembling Storm-Earth-Fire is nearly fully worn down to dissappear. But maybe we will still play after these changes, yes... we can't let behind our history, thoose many hours, our energy and time even money fit in the game. We had moments when we were angry, joyful, when we had disagreements... when we sweat blood at thoose 70mins games. Even tho we have dissidence, BUT now we all agree in one thing: some of these changes are NOT good...That's why we forge together, showing our loyalty to this game.

            "review_text": "Let me start by saying this, Dota 2 is my favourite game of all time, but I feel that most of the time the negatives outweigh the positives.  The negatives:  1. The community is cancerous. Everyone spams 'ez' or 'изи' ('ez' in Russian) at the end of every single match, making the losers feel terrible and spreading that attitude of negativity to others. People also spam 'ez mid' or 'noob' for no reason other than making others feel bad.  2. The ranked system is broken. I don't care what some 6k egotist on reddit says about 'git gud to raise your mmr'. That is simply fallacious. Raising your mmr is just a case of playing a snowballing mid and hoping for the best, but the people on your team will almost never let you go mid and argue about it. You can't help if you get matched with people that intentionally feed or go afk. No matter how well you do in the game, if you lose, your mmr decreases. This also works the other way around. If you feed deliberately but your team wins, you gain mmr. Seems fair. The only way it seems to raise your mmr consistently is to abuse the cancer (overpowered) heroes of the patch (looking at you, Slark), in which case, it is not by skill that you are raising your mmr, but by abusing a broken hero. Again, a broken system. Don't hope to have fun in ranked.  3. 90% of the people I get matched with can't speak English, despite my language preference being set to English.  4. Even though the game has over 110 heroes, you see the same ones over and over again (PA, LC, Drow, Slark, Pudge etc) meaning you have to play the same heroes over and over to counter them.  5. Getting reported for no/stupid reasons. I got reported by 3 people because I said I was playing Windranger as a support, because they believed that she was best as a carry (we won that game aswell).  The positives:  1. The game is fun with friends. Playing in a 5 stack also eliminates the possibility of deliberate feeders and AFK'ers.  2. Cosmetic items keep the heroes fresh and add something for people that enjoy collecting things.  3. Sometimes you will get a good team and have a really fun game.  4. The game looks very nice visually.  5. The game is insanely addictive.  The game itself is very good, but it just gets ruined by the players.  Nominating for the 'Just 5 More Minutes' award as it is the most addictive game that I have ever played.",

The only problem is every game is different, in the far too many games I've played I don't think I've ever had the same game before. When your teammates ask you 'What were you thinking when you did that?' Generally with some curses thrown in, normally you don't have a good reply, they can all see with hindsight, you couldn'tve have known that Pudge had an Invis rune. In all honesty Dota is really fun to play with friends, whether you're just messing around or playing seriously, if your lucky maybe 1/50 games if you make the effort you can pick up some new friends to play with.   Pros -Easy to pick up/simple -Very interesting in that every game is different -No hero is truly 'OP' at least for long, there are always counters. -Meet many interesting people -Some people truly try to help  Cons -Toxic community (for the most part) -Random people not on your language preference speaking stuff you don't understand -Learning to play all 90 or so heroes instead of 2 takes a little while -People saying you suck if you don't have a set -Watching people do exactly the opposite of what you recommended and dieing -Watching people do exactly what you asked and dieing",

Dota 2 requires alot of skill and it isn't a game where ou jump right in to the game like TF2. Valve intended that players should find their favourite hero and learn tacticts with that hero however most players don't get that and hate on it for childish or just ride the hate wagon. Let's get to the game now... You start in the same map each time (And I would appreciate some more maps). Each side looks similar and there are 3 main roads to each team's spawn but they are protected by minions, towers and players, the objective is to destroy the towers and get to the enemy base and destroy this core thingamajic. You start leveling up your character and your abilities/hero gets stronger and it's key to the game. You will really need to play as a team rather than a lone wolf and will require you to speak with your teammates and not expect them to know your stun and attack plan.   I will give this game a 4.7/5. I think it's a good game but it might need some new maps.",

Dota 2 is a well balanced and evenly paced MOBA which offers a lot of variety when it comes to Heroes to play and items to make your hero stronger. The game has quite a steep learning curve, but once you feel like you've gone over that curve then the game becomes so enjoyable especially with friends. The game has now been released and is F2P, so what do you have to lose?  Negatives:   The community is quite hostile to anyone who doesn't play very well, sadly. A lot of Russian players don't even want to play with other Russians and instead choose the 'English' language preference and end up screwing over the people who actually do speak English and causes communication issues. The toxic behavior some people in this game can be unreal, and they will sometimes do whatever it takes to make your game horrible. Yeah, you can mute them and try to ignore them but surely they would be inclind to just help the enemy team by feeding themselves to them just because you done one thing wrong that they didn't like.

            "review_text": "Don't get me wrong, this isn't a bad game. Not by any stretch. It's a candidate for my favourite game of all time, in fact. I have a second account devoted to it, where my playtime is similar, and I haven't gotten anywhere close to 2000+ hours in any other video game.  But I can't recommend it to a new player, for a single very significant reason.   The community is the single most toxic community I have ever been a part of. It is extremely, extremely rare for a match to be completely free of players abusing you for bad decisions and shouting at you over a microphone in a language you can't even understand. For me, it's become comical, but for a new player, unless they have friends that are willing to teach them the basics and help them learn the mechanics of the game, they are going to struggle. There are tutorials, but these are beyond limited, and with a pool of 113 Heroes each with individual and unique abilities, the learning curve is exceptionally steep. In order to be a ''good'' player, every detail of every single skill and item in the game will need to be learned (that is, its function, cooldown, damage, added effects, gold cost, mana cost, and more.) This takes several hours to achieve. The best way of learning all these intricate details would usually be to just play the game, but the aforementioned toxic community makes this impossible unless you have a number of friends willing to play alongside you while you learn the basics.  Now, let's assume you have a group of four friends, or you are lucky enough to be matched with reasonable and understanding players. Let's assume that you've put the time into learning the mechanics of the game.   You're going to have a great time. The game is, with a few glaring exceptions,    *cough* Monkey King *cough*    well balanced and fair at all times, putting the outcome of each and every game at least largely down to the player's skill and their ability to communicate with their team. It is completely and utterly free to play, there are no extra heroes or stat bonuses that can be bought, although there are cosmetic item sets and other miscellaneous items such as different soundtracks and HUDs that can be bought with real money, but these are entirely optional. This means that every player has access to the same number of heroes, and on top of that Heroes are not cycled like in other MOBAs- all 113 heroes are available all the time. The sheer amount of playtime that this game offers is mindblowing, especially taking the fact that it is free into consideration. I can't think of any other game, free or otherwise, that could remain so fresh and enjoyable for so long. There are so many different playstyles and so many different incredible hero combinations that can be utilised, the cliché that 'no two games are the same' definitely applies here.  On top of all this, it's excellently optimised- most systems will be able to run it at a semi-decent framerate.  The terrible community and the natural learning curve that comes with the MOBA genre really are a shame, because this game really is a true achievement of video gaming. Its a 10/10 game without a doubt but it's near impossible to get into, and it is that very factor that means, in the vast majority of cases, this game cannot be recommended.",

The more kills, the player is getting rich, and vice versa, the more killed, players will lack the gold so it can not upgrade the item itself.  DotA 2 is a team game, not a solo game, because if you want to solo do not play DotA, go play chess. Therefore, it's useless if only one hero who has a hero equip decent but the other does not, the team will definitely lose. This game teaches us that we can not stand alone without the help of others, especially the help from our friends.    Players Type Server Dota 2 In Southeast Asia      People are always calling other people as Pinoy  Pinoy is slang for the Philippines. For unknown reasons why, if you have people like this in the game so if something goes wrong then you will be called Pinoy by this person. No matter where you come from countries, such as Indonesia, Malaysia or Singapore you will still be called Pinoy. Such people will assume Pinoy is a person who can not play the game without seeing meraka national origin.     People who are considered by the other players as Pinoy  It does not matter if you're Filipino or not, if you make a mistake then you will automatically be Pinoy. This may not be too offended if the person who made a mistake is the Philippines. Although the Philippines has a bad reputation in Dota 2, but not all Filipinos will admit it. Filipino nationalists are people who, if they were heckled by pinoy call then they will become more aggressive. So I think you should focus on their mistakes rather than calling him Pinoy.     People who do Crowing Bottle selfishly until the end of the game  Bottle crowing is a technique used to increase the survivability, especially in the middle lane and it was fine. That is not cool is to do it at the extreme stage. Do you have to be selfish bottle crowing from the beginning to the end of the game? Why? Although the role of support you are, you realize that I also need a courier? For example, for the wards? Do you realize that there are 4 other people who also need their items? If you make the team overwhelmed just because you need a bottle crowing to survive until the end of the game then I think you should review again the way you play this game.     People from Europe or North America who complain about lag  No such thing as dedicated servers. I know it. But sooner or later you will meet the person who decided to play the game on the server that is located in another part of the earth. It is not wrong because the rules do not prohibit it. I even tried to queuing at the European servers to play with friends there. But if you experience lag during play because choosing a server far away there then stop complaining or worse pause hoping lagnya lost.     People who pretend to be someone Singapore or Malaysia  With the purpose of pretending to be a person of Singapore or Malaysia, people like this will continue to add 'le' or 'la' every time he says something. And I mean absolutely everything ('Top la! B la! Nice la! GGWP la!'). How do I know that there are people who pretend to be like this? Because I know some of them. Why do they do it? I do not know for sure. If they want to retrace the footsteps of Daryl 'iceiceice' Cai Yee Koh or 'Mushi' then they need to be more than just wearing this access.     People Pinoy  I'm actually not sure whether to be a player from the Philippines could fall into this category. But if you think about it I have never heard of the other players in Southeast Asia servers invoked with the country of origin besides Pinoy. This may be because the Pinoy has a way of 'unique' in the play and 'act' in pubs. It all comes back to you to consider whether the Pinoy is a bad player or not. But the bright side is, they are quite 'creative' in play Dota. They just need guidance in the right direction and sometimes a reality punch when #PinoyPride syndrome relapse ('Pinoy Doto, Best Doto').    This review translatable in   Google Translate   ",

But once the practice and skill comes, it really pays off and you will soon find yourself right into the game. Dota 2 provides fun gameplay for both those who just want a good time and for those who want to play competitive. I believe that this game has been very well prepared and is continuing to grow at a steady pace. New aspects of the game are regularly made to keep the game going. Some of these include new gamemodes (such as Diretide and Wraith Night) and new heroes (such as the three spirits and Legion Commander). The game provides a friendly welcome to the new players by giving a tutorial and offering practice without any negative criticism from raging players. As well as that, coaches have been introduced to help you as you game so don't be afraid to try it out! Overall I really recommend this game whether you are playing by yourself or with friends.  Rating: 9/10 Notes: Overall very good. The 1 point off is just the community and the matchmaking ranking. By this i mean that usually i'm put with like people that are very new (not that i'm against them, it's just that at my level i expect people with higher skill levels) sometimes mess up really badly and cost me the game. Additionally, they sometimes blame for no apparent reason. A solution to this is the new ranked matchmaking but how are you going to be put in the right skill bracket if you are constantly pulled down? A note the new players, try to practice with bots before going into pubs :)",

The game consists of two teams that are put in an arena (like a circle for cockfight) where you should defend something called 'ancient' but in reality you do not enter the game to defend him but rather to destroy the opponent 'ancient' killing against their will who defends him (the other players), as you can already hear the name diverts from the real purpose of the game, the game wants you to suppress your opponent at all costs (even the death of your hero which then justifies by waiting a few seconds before being reborn). all that is evil because it creates negative emotions deep that then imply that they are filled only by playing more games, in this game you do not feel good if you lose, and even if you win, if you lose you do not feel good because you were not able to overcome the challenge to fight as roosters against a person, you feel as deprived from that person and you lose everything that the game says 'you should' defend as important to not know what purpose, the simple fact of losing to someone too many times can create a sense of depression as if to say that we are not able to be on par with someone and to succumb to their will, and that is where it comes hatred towards teammate, you do not agree to not being up to the game and start to blame the teammates. every time after training you will prove that you have become better and the game puts you against opponents that you are not yet up to beat and the cycle begins again.the game makers have implemented the system of ranking so as to push on this mechanism even more since the number you see written on the screen at the time indicates how much you're worth inside of their system, more you practice and the more they reward you with a number on the screen , but the fact that you play only goes as they please because keeps alive the game and they can make money over there.not even win games is rewarding because what you must do is suppress the enemy against his will and make him feel bad as you never wanted to feel when you lost the matches. they call it 'free to play' because this mechanism is activated immediately, they know that probably many of the people who try the game will pay with their dedication, time and hidden deep sadness and justifying it as a passion for the game. the fact that they sell cosmetics items in the store is just another way to take advantage of weak minds not to mention the money that goes around the 'pro gaming', there are tournaments with millions of dollars as a reward, and you compete on a game that is completely unbalanced, with many bugs and even less content of the first version exists for many years.  in the end this is horrifying, I think I analyzed it all exhaustively.",

The game's punishing design is sometimes enough to drive you up the wall, but it's worth sticking the hours in: success in Dota 2 is about learning to effectively juggle both the broad strokes and finer details.  If you're not aware of the basics of the burgeoning MOBA genre, two teams of five players spawn on corners of a map. Each team needs to work together with the goal of ultimately destroying a central structure--in Dota 2's case, the Ancient--in the opposing team's base. With most games lasting around the 40-minute mark, and occasionally edging past an hour, watching the enemy fortress dramatically crumble and sink to the ground feels like an exhilarating payoff.",

You can play as an oblivious person with your oblivious friends and derp around the game and have lots of fun trying to bash each others heads in while trying to break that coveted ancient, but be warned; if you enjoy this game you might want to try playing online.  Playing online is a different experience ENTIRELY. Team work becomes so much much oh ever so much much so muchly much much more crucial than before (Dr.Suess reference XD) If you are still playing with your group of friends though at this point that should help a lot. But like many people (myself included) you will be in games where you are alone amongst 4 strangers All of whom have their own agenda seemingly (it is not ALWAYS like this.) you will try your best to help your team win but it will inevitably end in a couple of your teammates being head-strong idiots who fed the other team (let the other team kill them to many times) then the fed team is big bad and bulky, then you lose.  There are games where you and your team will work together and you will DESTROY!!! that will not always be the case so enjoy it when it happens and get over it when it doesn't.  If you plan on being great at this game be prepared to spend hours researching what the items do; all of the recipes, heroe's skills (especially ultimates), and watch games of people who are good (I reccomend Purge he's on YouTube.)  If all this seems overwhelming it's because this game can be CRAZY overwhelming however it has potential to be CRAZY fun!   The bottom line is what you put into this game is what you will get out of it; at the time of this review i have 270+ hours in-game and I still feel relatively noobish; I have been having fun this whole time however.  So if you don't feel like putting away crazy amounts of time into a game then i suggest you get 1-9 friends who also don't know how DOTA works to get this game and just play private games together and have a BLAST because it is quite a lot of fun.   A little about me. I played DOTA 1 the Warcraft III mod as a late-comer with 1 other friend game after game and we derped PLENTY But through those games I learned about the stats and recipes of about 90% of the items in the game, giving me a pretty sizable advantage.  I could have made this review about ten times longer but then it would have been a guide... (it already kind of is)  10/10 by the way this game is great!",

There are some items that are incredibly rare and un-attainable unless you are willing to pay a good £30/50 for them. For example the Treasure of the Emerald Dragon that came out recently was only out for an hour and the items within it are amazing but are beyond comprehension and you'd have to sell an unusual of TF2 in order to obtain it. It's a fun game in itself, however I'm just a bit peeved that the developers would make it so impossible for fans to gain the cooler items they love and how some treasures are hidden from the public eye. Download the game, love it for what it is and sell your soul to it; then realise you can't obtain the beautiful items you would like :)",

Each heroes have their own specific roles so choose wisely and don't anyhow go whatever you feel like.   There is no in-game money in this game and you earned different rewards as you play many matches.   There is a lore for you to read for each character if you're interested.   However these game have a steep leaning curve and those who are new to MOBA genre will struggle how the gameplay system work.   It require a lot of tactics &amp; teamwork in order to win a match........that is if your partner will listen to you cause a lot of player i found will quickly rage at you if you make a minor issue while some other just rage quit because they felt like they cannot make a comeback.

            "review_text": "The horn bellowed throughout the battlefield, signaling yet another war for these 10 brave warriors to fight. The green and red foot soldiers and magi of the Radiant and Dire sharpened their swords and practiced their spells, all whilst praying to their ancient and reminiscing memories of their families one last time; as they knew that once they set out of the barracks and into war, they may never be able to see them again. These soldiers had to let go of all emotion now, as emotion on the battlefield is a sign of weakness; one the enemy could very well take advantage of.  But these soldiers knew they were nothing; they would die to the sword of the enemy, and no one would remember them. There are thousands and thousands of them, they were not allowed to be phased by the death of their comrade. They knew that they were but meat shields to be used by the real warriors, the heroes, in their quest to destroy the enemy ancient. One of these brave and skilled heroes was Kanye. Kanye of the West. Kanye has witnessed many battles on this battlefield. He fights 5-6 wars a day, sleeps by dawn, wakes by the morning, and is ready to fight 5-6 more. These wars were but play time for him, he would fight enemy heroes, kill or be killed by them, and just laugh at whatever the result. There was no doubt in his comrades' mind that he was skilled, but there is a slight problem with Kanye, one that stops him from receiving all awards and accolades that he very well deserves.  Kanye wasn't allowed to receive any awards for wars that he participates in as he would suddenly disappear from them, for apparently no reason. It was obvious Kanye didn't want to leave any of the wars he participates in; he does well, never complains, never bad mouths his enemies, and all in all, has fun. But even through all these, all these disappearances negatively affect his record, as he is penalized and banned from all awards and accolades for a given amount of battles. Therefore, Kanye has to push and force himself through wars that he isn't even given credit for to get rid of his penalty, before he can receive awards again. ********************************************************************************************** 'Kanye, be careful. I see no enemy in sight, they might be headed your way.' Kanye heard, as he slashed at enemy soldiers from atop his steed. 'Copy, no problem.'  This was Kanye's last battle before he would be recognized for his efforts one again. Once he finishes this fight, every succeeding war that he fights after will finally be recognizes by his superiors, and the motivation he once had of fighting will finally be rekindled. Kanye pulled his sword out of the last foot soldier in the enemy battalion, and wiped the blood off with his hand.  Out of the corner of his eye, he caught a short glimpse of movement in the trees. He pulled the reins of his horse towards the trees, and his horse promptly followed. 'I think I got one over here where I am, but I'm not sure who it is quite yet.' Kanye said. 'Alright, we're on our way there. Be careful.' 'I'm closing in on where I saw the movement.' As his horse clopped towards the trees, a horrid stench began to creep unto his nostrils. 'Damn, it stinks.' He whispered. 'Crap! I think I know wh-' Kanye's sentence was cut short, as he suddenly saw a bloodied chain hook speed towards him. 'Come to Pudgey!' The hook dug deep into his back, as he was pulled towards where it was thrown. The stench grew stronger the farther he was pulled, and as he turned his head around, he saw what atrocious being was the cause of this. Pudge. ''Ello, mate. How 'ya doin' today?' Pudge yelled as he pulled Kanye and his dark horse towards him. 'Sorry to spoil your little party over there, but I decided that I wanted to join in.' Kanye reached for his sword and slashed at the chain of the hook. The chain easily snapped and fell to the ground. 'Oh, I'm sorry Pudge. Did I break your little hook toy? You'd think a butcher would get a stronger chain for his hook than that, yeah?' Kanye laughed as he pulled the hook out of his back. 'Oh that thing, mate? I have a lot more where that came from, don't worry.' 'Enough talk. Your breath is killing me more than your fighting. Let's dance.'  Kanye raised his reins, lifting his horse up. 'Aphotic Shield!' A dark magic surrounded Kanye, forming an impenetrable shield. He charged, sword at the ready, at the huge hunk of talking meat in front of him. 'I'm not scared of you, mate. Get over 'ere.' *Poof* Kanye disappeared. 'What?' Pudge said confused as he looked around him, searching for signs of the lord of Avernus and his horse. 'He seems to have disappeared, mates.' Pudge told his teammates. 'Who?' 'Kanye.' 'Oh, Kanye. He always disappears, don't worry. He's gone, move on now.' 'Alrighty then.' ********************************************************************************************** The slight drizzle has become a full blown heavy rain, banging on the metal surface of our roof like cats and dogs falling from the sky. And there I was, staring at my monitor. *Auto disconnect in (25.0) seconds* My heart sank and my blood boiled. I have played in the low priority matchmaking for almost a whole month now, all because of this crappy internet.  *Auto disconnect in (10.0) seconds* I alt-tabbed, opened google chrome, typed in  google.com  in the address bar, and alas, the page wouldn't open. There was no internet. I disconnected from the game, and I had 5 minutes to reconnect. I immediately turned off my router, hoping that a hard reset would fix the problem. I went outside, ate dinner as fast as I could, went back in my room, and turned the router on. My heart pumped stronger than Derrick Rose would as he lays a shot into the basket. The final light lit up, signalling that the router was fully on. My laptop connected to the internet, I opened up Dota 2, and reconnected to the game. 'Did I abandon already?' I typed into the chat. It took a while for someone to reply. I was hoping they were typing something along the lines of: 'No, we paused it just for you!' This thought brought me a slight glimmer of hope that maybe, just maybe, I did not have to play Dota 2 in the low priority bracket for another 5 games, and that I cou- 'Yes.' replied another player. Well, that sucks.  I disconnected from the game, my heart heavy from sadness as I slowly walked towards the kitchen, and asked my mom to cook me 2 more eggs for me to eat.  I cri. ********************************************************************************************** TL;DR My internet sucks and never works, and i'm mad. 11/10 would abandon again",

New players on team.  2. Crying baby you have to babysit.  3. Angry all knowing abuser.  4. Russians …  5. Open karaoke in foreign language.  6 .Being forced to play same role over and over in hope that you might win (&amp; still lose).  7. Losing to a PA/Bashing heroes (Bara/Troll/Void(+backtrack))  8. Being blamed by the whole team for being the solo support and getting focused by the enemy team.  9. and so on …   If you can handle at least 4 of the above mentioned points, you should definitely try to play dota, Yes it has a steep learning curve as many people have rightly pointed out, but once in a while you do get those games which just makes you wanna come back for me. And to continue playing in dota you need to invest more time like one does for studies to be able to maintain your standing in the MMR or general pubs or you can say that you play for the FUN, ( but we all know, we play for the Win :P ).  Yes the dota community is bit harsh and you will need lot of patience to get through to people and once in a while you will rage at others as well but that is just part and parcel of this game. But once you get into it and start enjoying it, it is one of the best game available in market which can give you the best feeling of accomplishment and satisfaction when you win a game after a long and hard battle which will just keep you coming back for more and more.",

The community is so garbage that it will kill this game for you.   No lie, no joke, you will grow to be the most cynical hateful person because everyone 90% of the time in the game forces you to be the only competent one.   The game itself also has quite a few flaws, for instance the pathfinding is absolutely horrendous and in terms of balancing there isn't much.   You may look at the roster and want to pick a cool looking hero, but you shouldn't because ♥♥♥♥ you. Most heroes are either irrelevant to drafters who know what they're doing or are jokes. Each patch has a rotation of heroes that are strongest that will be overplayed in every skill bracket untill they get nerfed to the point of irrelevance. Then there are some heroes that are just absolutely broken and shouldn't be in the game to begin with because no matter how many times they are nerfed or their counters get buffed they manage to find a way in.   Also, the game has an extreme learning curve but no utillities in present to help you learn it. The tutorial shows you the most basic information the could've figured out by just playing the game however it does look nice. The bots aren't programmed particularily well, but they may show you some things that the tutorial did not care to mention.   The most irratating part of the game is that there is no region lock, so in a communcation teambased game (and i've had this happen before) you may get up to 5 different langauges on the same team.   Most of the time its dysfunctional numbing mess that makes you wonder if you have too much free time like me.  Positives  If you have the patience, and the iron will to grind for competent teammates and try to have a positive attitude the game is actually quite fun. It offers a good challenge, and despite win or loose some games really are 'gg' (good game). When both teams have 'meta' heroes that can fight each other equally it becomes a real good time. Working as a team to accomplish a goal, and playing well really has a fulfilling feel to it and if you like that, you may want to try this game.  While the game is scattered interms of balance, each hero can be fun in its own way, and each certainly different to it. Some heroes act fairly simillar, but even then they each have their own feel that makes each worth trying out atleast once.   Individual playstyle in certain heroes is also highlighted by this uniqueness and your personality and how you play often shines through by what you play the most.   For instance i'm a prick so i play heroes that display this through underhanded and dirty tatics. In contrast one of friends who plays mostly nice characters that do simple things is a pretty nice guy.   All in all this is like the cheap hooker of mobas, she may look nasty and she probably got some diseases but shes experienced in the job and no matter how many STD's she contracts she'll be always for a good time every once in a while.

I will say this particular type of strategy game has never really been my favorite so I may be a bit biased. In execution this game just feels tedious and repetitive. You painstakingly build up your character and slowly attempt to take over bits of territory inch by inch. The thing is by the time you are about to win or lose the match i've been ready for it to end for weeks. There is depth here but for myself the mechanics are either too simple (wait for the perfect moment to kill something to get a gold bonus) and tedious (kill your own minion to prevent your opponent from getting a gold bonus) for me to want to stick with the game for any longer.  I appreciate what they got right (relatively simple game design with loads of features) in this game but the bottom line is that I just do not enjoy playing it and cannot see where the crazy high ratings are coming from.  I would technically give this game a 5/10 which would lead to me normally hiting a yes to the recommend option on these reviews. I still would recommend it to people who are fans of warcraft and the rts in general. However because of the overwhelming positive number of ratings and reviews a 5/10 is about as negative a review as I have seen on this game. I am clealry in the minority here and may be missing something...maybe i'll try and pick it up again in a few months but for right now I am putting it down and scratching my head.",

I would know because i dropped 300 points since the calibration and haven't gained a single point. Why? SirActionSlacks has given the most accurate representation of sub 2k ranked matches, your on the ss dumb***k. Everyone sucks and your stuck. This is known as the potato level, a place almost impossible to escape because often you are put on teams with potatos that don't even know that you need to buy boots. I'm not talking about phase boots or power treads, no these people are mentally handicaped and dont even know how to buy boots of speed. To summarise don't do ranked matchs unless your playing with friends because most of the time your team will suck and you need at least one good player.  The most common misconception is that you can't use op heroes in mmr matchs, that is utter bs. If you don't then you may aswell abandon because the other team will and the result will be your entire team sitting in the fountain for half the game because the second you leave the base the enemy will win a 2v5 and you will always get one a**ehole that says to report your team in the chat for feeding when hes the one with 15 deaths and 0 kills.",

It has an impossibly steep learning curve that requires hundreds of hours of dedicated play to reach even a sub-competent level of skill. It requires an intuition that has been cultivated to an instict-like level. Succeeding at this can provide a high unrivaled by any other kind of video game. It's the addicting kind of high that makes you strive to play more and get better. But just like heroin, the more you play, the more those satisfying highs become fewer and farther between. There are hundreds of variables, many of which are almost completely out of your control, that can impact how fun or satisfying a game is. Worst of all, the community is not welcoming to new players in any way. You will be personally insulted. You will be blamed and flamed. Every decision you make will be questioned and judged by people who usually have almost no idea what they're talking about. 50%-90% of games which depend heavily on team-coordination will have people on your team that do not speak the same language (Don't worry, they will still insult you in their native tongue). People will rage and lag and quit. All of these things stand between you and that next heroin high. They waste tons of time, they don't help and in some cases are detrimental to you getting better or making improvements, and it's not fun. That's right. 50%-90% of the 30-60 minute games you will play will honestly not be fun. And that is AFTER you have spent all this time learning and becoming proficient at the game. Seriously. Don't play this game.",

There are a lot of other MOBAs out there, but Dota 2 is the best one for me. Dota 2 offers complexity, depth, and excitement unlike any other MOBA. I would definitely recommend Dota 2 to people who have never tried it yet. Dota 2 might be difficult for beginners, but I can assure that if you continue to play and study the learning curves of the game that it would be an amazing and life-changing experience.",

            "review_text": "Hey you, yeah you! Don't have the brain capacity to control a massive army, build bases, and execute daring army battles even though this game's mechanics were taken from real-time-strategy games? And do you enjoy blaming teammates rather than doing something about it when you're losing? Do you enjoy picking characters, who only need right-clicks(carries) to function? Do you say 'we no def' when you're losing even though the game is called DEFENSE OF THE ANCIENTS? Then if so you hypocritical basterd, this game is meant for you!   Expect your first matches to be full of carries and practically no support plays at all! But who cares? You're having fun losing! Be careful though young warrior! Matches can be full of people complaining about your play or the items you buy! Don't worry they're just jealous of your feedi-- I mean killing streak! So what if they call a 'r*tarded play' or a 'wrong item' on you, if you're getting killz, then it's all fine! They're just jelly that you found a secret new meta before they could! So what if you play a support hero and they complain when you last hit? Not your fault my brotha, they're just too slow to react! So what if you're a support hero and not buy wards? Those wards are expensive as shet! If they want all the farm, while you just stand there, and then expect you to buy wards, then they are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ as ♥♥♥♥! How can you possibly buy wards when you don't have any gold?! Bunch of r*♥♥♥♥♥, amirite?   You'll notice in your first games that people like to kill other people. Well that's normal, people do that in real life. But you must remember this golden rule: Always push. Kid, no matter how many times you pawn their noob arses you can't win if you can destroy the ancient. This game is not won by kills but by pushing. For example: There is an impending 5 on 5 brawl or 'clash' as they call it. But as your teammates prepare for bloodshed you notice at the other side of the map a pack of allied mindless soldiers or 'creeps' as they call it, slowly march towards an enemy tower. This is the perfect situation to push because the enemy 'Heroes' are way too far to respond to their tower being pushed. So what do you do? Ditch your teammates and head for that tower. Wait until they have started fighting and then you push. With the enemy team busy slaying your outnumbered teammates, you're free to burn that tower down to the ground. Results? A bounty of gold, and a pushed tower! Your teammates can complain all they want about you leaving them, when in fact they should be thanking you for giving them the tower bounty, ungrateful basterds.  If somehow, you managed to get to their 3rd tower, you'll notice that behind it are two buildings. These two buildings spawn the mindless 'creeps'. Unless you destroy the 3rd tower, these buildings are invulnerable, meaning they can't be f*cked with. If you destroy the 3rd tower then they are stripped of their godlike armor and now are ok to f*ck with. Pro tip: Destroy the melee barracks first. Why? Because destroying it somehow gives your melee creeps steroids. And since the melee creeps are the most produced creeps, giving them steroids is the most rewarding effect. And also, the building somehow has a regeneration effect, meaning it will heal itself! So if you're going to attack it, might as well destroy it now or you'll be forced to retreat and watch it 'heal'. Which leaves you to wonder as to how is it able to heal itself if it's just a building. How? Because f*ck logic that's why! And if you manage to destroy all of the enemy's barracks then the in-game announcer will shout: 'Mega creeps!' Signifying that all of the allied creeps have steroids. At that point, you can pretty much let the creeps swarm the enemy. I mean why not? You fought your ♥♥♥ out the whole match, and had to deal with the enemy's b*llsh*t, so why not let them have a slow and painful death? Sounds good doesn't it? And if you're lucky, you might witness an enemy hero get killed by being swarmed by your steroid creeps, fun ain't it?  When picking a 'hero' don't be that guy who picks first. And if you're notoriously unlucky, don't bother to random a hero. Yes it does give extra starting gold if you do, but you'll just end up giving it to the enemy as you feed. Let the others pick first. Take your time. This is the part of the game where you actually use the most of your mind with. Analyze, be considerate, and choose a hero who can both counter the enemy picks and complement your allied picks. Now that you've pick a hero it's time for the laning phase! If you're support then they will need wards, and wards need gold to possess, so what do you do? GO TO MID LANE. Why? So you can last hit without any teammate hogging all the farm. If you're carry then they will need you to get lots of exp and gold, so what do you do? GO TO MID LANE. If you're an offlaner then you need farm to get utility skills and items, so what do you do? GO TO MID LANE. If you're tank then they need you to get tanky items and lots of exp to get stronger, so what do you do? GO TO MID LANE. In fact, any hero you choose is a prime choice for mid lane. Remember, first come gets the lane.  But anyways this game is quite addictive and may ruin your social life, if you even had one. Friends, family, love ones all seem insignificant when you're in a match. If you're still in school, study time may become dota time, and if you're working, well you know what's going to happen. Overall this game has achieved what all games should achieve: Making you play and enjoy this game. So yes I recommend this game.   Good day to you sir",

            "review_text": "Defense of the Ancients 2 is my favorite video game. It is a free-to-play game created and maintained by the Valve Corporation, which is headquartered in Bellevue, Washington and ruled by the legendary Gabe Logan Newell. Defense of the Ancients 2 (DotA2) is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) in which each of ten players (two teams of five players each) take control of ten heroes to do battle and fulfill objectives on a roughly-symmetrical playing field. The game is routinely praised for being unforgivingly strategic and nearly impossible to master. Players seeking any level of success must be nimble of hand, cunning of mind, and, perhaps most importantly, completely void of human emotion: when two warriors lock eyes on the battlefield, be they the armorclad Dragon Knight, the enigmatic Juggernaut, the unrelenting Bloodseeker, or the mischievous faerie-dragon Puck, all mercy must be put aside. The best teams do not only destroy their opponents, though that is an important part: the best teams humiliate their enemies, casting them down like broken-winged birds into the loser’s pit of shame amidst an unceasing stream of ridicule and scorn. In a sense it is not a battle of heroes: it is a battle of egos where the most resilient emerges the victor. I, having accrued nearly two thousand matchmaking points, am unusually good, and with my signature hero, the Sniper, I have sown violence and death across thousands of battlefields. Regarding items, I start with a Butterfly. Providing massive bonuses to agility, attack speed, and evasion, it is, by a wide margin, the best item in the game. I usually stay mid lane and farm gold until I finish it, typically around minute 40, at which point I will start roaming and ganking. After netting a few kills I will purchase Mask of Madness to improve my attack speed and mobility. Some people prefer Boots of Speed as their mobility item, but in my opinion, only the dimmest of dimwits rely on passive effects: a truly skilled player (like me) can utilize active effects to greater result. Not to mention the Boots of Speed have no offensive capabilities whatsoever—neither attack damage, attack speed, or agility. One could argue that the upgraded Boots of Speed (called Power Treads) remedies this problem, but I would counter-argue that the passive 30 increased attack speed granted by the Power Treads pales in comparison to the Mask of Madness’s active attack speed bonus of 100. It is painfully obvious which is better—yet still I am routinely disappointed by just how many players refuse to buy the Mask of Madness. Passive effects are the bane of my online existence.",

In dota you are the minion, your master unseen, yet he sends creatures to aid you, you are not alone, other heroes battle with you, users, have wow in such a unique blend of both multiplayer battles with astounding detail, every character can move their mouths the designs on their clothes visible, cloth waving in the winds.  One thing i very much respect is when you point your character in all new directions he won't repetitively bother you with. 'Yes.' 'Setting tragectory,' 'I'm manning this spot,' They each have a variety of things to say when walking, and won't say it every time you click, which is such a distraction in most MMORPG.  The only thing that would prevent me from loving it fully was the amazing 3D face you have in the corner, getting to see your hero is great, but he only talks when walking or being reincarnated (Coming back to life after dying,) this game supports mic input, so why wouldn't they have your character talk in the side when you did. anyway, that's a minor issue i see with it, this game is great, there is literally no reason not to get it, this game is free to play, and totally awesome.  #UPDATE002: Upon playing more of Dota 2, i have found a major flaw in all of their matchmaking systems. you see i have 5 matches left, in laggy servers, just because i quit. i wasn't abandoning i had my language on spanish not english, so my server was all the way in mexico, it was lagging on so i disconnected, next thing i know, the accept button now says 'Accept low prioity match'. so now i can only join laggy servers for abandoning the team. I COULDN'T DO ANYTHING FOR THE TEAM LIKE THAT. and now whoever quits the low priority servers i keep joining, it adds up to my punishment as they say, my punishment list. in numbers, well i'm currently at 5, yeah, it's fun to pay off my punishment, for having to quit! and that's why my review is now 8 out of 10, not 9 out of 10 anymore, thanks valve, way to make me hate your game, i still like this game enough to play it and have fun with it, but i'm stuck having to wait out in servers a sitting duck (Cause the lag is too much to bear, i'll only be feeding myself to the enemy.) until my numbers run dry!   hopefully thing review provides a lengthy opinion on why you i recommend it. this game was put together greatly, but still failed in a big part of me, i believe this game deserves a 8 out of 10.

It'll drag you in mud , before throwing you in freezing cold water . But DoTA is rewarding . DoTA is like God .

You won't understand . But worse , English speaking people . Yes , they are worse . They'll tell you 'stfu noob' they'll say 'stup feeding' when you don't , 'u sukkk' when you do better than'em .

The game's punishing design is sometimes enough to drive you up the wall, but it's worth sticking the hours in: success in Dota 2 is about learning to effectively juggle both the broad strokes and finer details.  If you're not aware of the basics of the burgeoning MOBA genre, two teams of five players spawn on corners of a map. Each team needs to work together with the goal of ultimately destroying a central structure--in Dota 2's case, the Ancient--in the opposing team's base. With most games lasting around the 40-minute mark, and occasionally edging past an hour, watching the enemy fortress dramatically crumble and sink to the ground feels like an exhilarating payoff.",

Do you like hearing 10 pings per second from at least 2 people at the same time on a point on the map where you must go and die, thus feeding the enemy team (and then being called a noob)?  When alone at home, enjoying a quiet, uneventful afternoon, in a relaxed, civilised environment, do you feel the urge to throw yourself in a highly stressful, xenophobic, toxic, sausage-measuring slugfest of teenage (mostly Russian) boys with barely any knowledge of English, attempting to inflate their egos by virtually punching each other while insulting each other?

Although the game advertises a 5vs5 experience, at the very least it will be a 3vs7 because the first law of DOTA2 is 'In a public game, there will be a minimum of two mentally challenged people on your team.' If you're unlucky enough to stumble on to hard mode than the game will become a 1vs9. There are over 100 different heroes in the game with more being added which means you can experience different levels and forms of pointless bickering with mongoloids. 100+ heroes means you can experience literally A BAJILLION unique combinations of contracting Down's Syndrome from the community.  Ever see someone give up on life so easily? Well now is your chance! Enter matchmaking with other players and die at least twice within the first 3 minutes to watch players throw every single known profanity at you. Then watch as these players say 'gg go next' faster than you can ♥♥♥ from a cool summer breeze. If you die enough times in the game then watch as your team mates leave the game to kill themselves in order to ascend the DOTA2 heaven as this is the only appropriate reaction to getting a noob on your team.  Want to learn different languages but don't have the time? Too poor to afford free Google translate? Well now is your chance to become a multilingual god whose vast array of languages will surely impress the ladies.   Warning: Game is extremely addictive. Once you start playing, you have a 103% chance of becoming mentally challenged.  Overall, 1/10 would recommend.",

It was out of beta, and some of us knew about DOTA 1, so we gave it a go. From that moment i was obsessed with the game for something like a year. So were my friends. Dota became the most common game played among our community and spread like the ♥♥♥♥ing plague. Listen. The community might be toxic, the russians might be Russian, and I might be stuck at mid 2k MMR busting my ♥♥♥ off while some dickbag loses my team the match, but you know what.

Region and especially language settings are unfortunately more or less ignored at the moment. :(  Comparison to League of Legends In contrast to League of Legends you can play any hero right from the beginning, though recently the amount of 'new' heroes (so far there are still a few Dota 1 heroes awaiting to be 'ported') introduced is quite less than in League of Legends. There are no masteries or runes, which makes stuff easier in this regard. There are no summoner spells and no backteleporting (though you can buy teleportation scrolls which teleport you to any friendly building.) There an upgradable courier to bring you stuff! :D :D Felt there are a lot more monster or 'creature' heroes in Dota 2, hm. I don't mind humans Valve!  Free to play You can't buy any items which would give you any advance on your opponent. Which is a good thing I'd say. Items you can buy are cosmetical items, like armor parts (please don't start to force Item Sets on me Valve), different HUDs, taunt animations, differently looking wards etc.",

Developed by Valve Corporation, Dota 2 was released as a free-to-play title for Microsoft Windows, concluding a public beta testing phase that began in 2011. OS X and Linux versions of Dota 2 were released on July 18, 2013. The game is available exclusively through Valve's content-delivery platform, Steam.  Dota 2 is played in discrete matches involving two five-player teams, each of which occupies a stronghold at a corner of the map. Each stronghold contains a building called the 'Ancient', which the opposite team must destroy to win the match. Each player controls a 'Hero' character and focuses on leveling up, collecting gold, acquiring items and fighting against the other team to achieve victory.  Development of Dota 2 began in 2009, when the developer of the DotA mod, IceFrog, was hired by Valve as lead designer. Dota 2 was praised by video game critics, who lauded its rewarding gameplay, enhanced production quality and faithfulness to its predecessor. However, the game was criticized for its steep learning curve and inhospitable community. Dota 2 has become the most actively played game on Steam, with daily peaks of over 800,000 concurrent players.",

Gameplay is a competition between the two teams, consisting of three or five persons. One team is the bright side, the second - the Dark. Each side, a different set of characters.

In addition, he regularly receives small amounts from its base, it can mine gold by killing enemies.  Murder heroes brings significantly more gold than the destruction of enemy creeps. In addition, the hero can collect and buy a variety of items that affect its strength and development, as well as provide additional benefits.  In the course of the game have to fight not only with the opposing party, but also beat the regular attack creeps, computer controlled.

I will not compare D2 to any other MOBA-game, because itll just cause some disturbance and trolling in the comments section. So lets compare it to the original: graphics(all of it inc. animation and artwork) got better, interface got free from the 'chains' of WC3 engine and became more user-friendly, after a while adequate matchmaking system(kind of...), ability to watch tournaments online in client itself, genious marketing model(you can buy ONLY cosmetic items, which will have no impact on balance(HEYO~ other MOBAs! sry..).

I got better since the beginning of course but there are still a lot of things hindering me from becoming better due to the people I often get teamed with. Unreasonable, uncultured, foul, uncooperative, egotistical and indenial people ruining my games 80% of the time. People like to say not to complain about others and work on yourself to get good and that's true. I can live with my mistakes and I know I do sometimes. But complaining about a team that snowballed pretty well until the mid game where every crumbled because of the refusal to get BKBs isn't my mistake when I've been telling them for 15 minutes to get a BKB and end the game. It was too late when my carries had their BKBs because they've been losing the past few team fights due to not being able to survive. Nobody cares how much damage per second you can do when you can hardly survive a fight. It's like having the fastest car in the world with no engine. Logic? I'm not a high skilled player and not very mechanical but I observe a lot of the things people do in pub games and often times my team makes the most mistakes. Primarily because they like to play for themselves and refuse to strategize and listen to the shot caller. I've been in normal skill bracket all my life since I started so I know how they play very well. If only my team is on the same page with me, I'd win most of my games and not have to waste time on a bunch of immature, fun loving (as in spoiling games and throwing), and unreasonable ♥♥♥♥faces.   TL;DR : I hate how most Pinoys, Indonesians, and Thais play. Mainly Filipinos and Indonesians because they think they know the game but they can never show it in their plays and for Thais, they barely speak a word of English so it was very difficult to communicate strategies with them.",

DotA 2's straightforward mechanics are simple to conceive yet difficult to master. And just when you think you've found a workable strategy for one of your favorite heros (of which, there are over 100 to choose from!!), a new patch is released with Nerfs &amp; Buffs that change the entire landscape of the game.  DotA 2 brings players together in a competitive environment where communciation, team dynamics, sacrifice and objective based gaming coalesce into perhaps the greatest online gaming experience ever.  The Internationial, an annual DotA 2 competition hosted by Valve, held it's 5th event in 2015 and boasted an impressive $18.5 million dollar prize pool. The prize pool is almost entirely generated by the DotA 2 community (all 11.5 million of us) and their (our) in-game purchases during the weeks preceding the event. The International's prize pool in 2015 was the second largest prize pool on record for that year, with winnings exceeding that of the Masters and Wimbeldon. (NOTE: The International 2016 shattered last year's prize pool with just over $20.5 million)  The content is centered in an epic fantasy realm filled with Knights, Dragons, Assassins, Kings, Magic, and enough lore to keep the obessive supporters (self included) entertained for days.  If you consider yourself a gamer and have yet to experience Dota 2, you are in for a real treat. I'm trading my console in folks! All it does now is collect dust, for I am ever busy defending my Ancient from ensuing attacks as I battle alongside warriors in arms as we ebb and flow across the Radiant/Dire battlefield to solidfy our victory, or die in defeat.",

Communication in this game is hard, the game does it good at that point, but then the russians and arabians or whatever show up when you clearly clicked EU-WEST and that you want to meet up with ENGLISH people instead of other language. So yeah, game is perfectly with regulary updates and interesting events, but the communitie really needs to get better (I mean a LOT better) or valve should just link english people with real english people and auto search for the best server instead of choosing the server. i would say 9.5/10 for the game (nothing is perfect) and 2/10 for the communitie (sometimes you meet a nice person)",

As a player of other moba games such as League of Legends, Heroes of the Storm, and Smite, in my own opinion Dota 2 is the best amongst them. For those who really want a challenge that is...... because Dota is not something that every player can play and expect to win easily. No, this is the only game which employs some of the hardcore moba features such as lasthitting and the sort. The variety in terms of heroes (which are all unlocked), combos, tactics is insane. I have put 1000+ hours in it and I still find tons of stuff everyday. And once you get the hang of it, you'll get addicted. Teamplay is a must in this game and i recommend you play with friends (or you can play and make some). Ofcourse, you'll need a long time to learn the game, but its worth it. Once you start ranked matches, its 'all about dat MMR'. I recommend it to all moba players out there who want a 'real' moba. If you want casual, go for LoL or something.  9/10",

I was a DotA player previously and shifted to DOTA 2 just before the The International Dota 2 Chamionship 2012, after I got beta invite from Steam. DotA players will love Dota 2 because of IceFrog and his concept and designs and its very similar to DotA but with added attractions and customization. If you have played DotA in your past you can very well know what the game is all about, but if you haven't, don't worry, DOTA 2 has got your back. You get training and how to play and all you need to know In-Game. Its a free to play game, but I think its about time to change that and make people buy this game just because its worth buying.  So, what are you thinking? Just download the game and start playing. Make friends and teams online or ask your friends to join alongside yourself. Just Remmeber : Every player you come across in game is there to have fun and enjoy the game like yourself. So, please keep the gaming spirit alive and don't forget to enjoy and have fun.

After a while i got one and what i saw after installation WAS AMASING! Valve's desingners and artists did their best to bring good old Defense of the Ancients up to the standarts of graphics and style of games today. I will not compare D2 to any other MOBA-game, because itll just cause some disturbance and trolling in the comments section. So lets compare it to the original: graphics(all of it inc. animation and artwork) got better, interface got free from the 'chains' of WC3 engine and became more user-friendly, after a while adequate matchmaking system(kind of...), ability to watch tournaments online in client itself, genious marketing model(you can buy ONLY cosmetic items, which will have no impact on balance(HEYO~ other MOBAs! sry..). After a couple of matches i got one thing perfectly clear: DotA2 gives you is thing that youll hate or love, dont think something in-between is possible. Conclusion: MOBA at its finest.

            "review_text": "Scientists (better known colloquially as Boffins) are a quirky and interesting bunch. Burdened with the responsibility for delving into the Forbidden Mysteries of the universe, they have an insatiable curiosity and an unhealthy obsession with monkeys. They also like Star Trek and love to make funny laser noises when they think no one is watching. Even though the endless pursuit of knowledge has driven them insane, they go about their tasks with great ardour and perseverance, not because they want to, but because they must. Because intelligence is a privilege. A gift, to be used for the good of mankind.  Since the beginning of time, science has waged an eternal war against the forces of Magic. Scientists claim that the Universe was created by a massive explosion called the 'Big Bada Boom', resulting from the collision of Egos from two Hollywood superstars in another dimension. The Magic guys however claim the Universe was created by some old white guy who sent his only son to Earth wearing his underpants on the outside with a symbol that looks like a red 'S' on his chest that meant 'hope' in his home language.  To this day, all attempts to resolve this war have been unsuccessful, often degenerating into drunken ribaldry and rampant wedgies. To settle the matter, Arthur C. Clarke declared that 'Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.' This is because whenever you go to Vegas to watch a magic show, you can never tell if the magician is using technological tricks or real magic.  Incidentally, practitioners of Vegas Magic are masters of manipulating the time-money continuum, as opposed to the space-time continuum favoured by garden variety scientists. Anyone who's ever observed one will wake up the next morning with 2 hours missing from their life and $40 missing from their wallet, having no memory of the previous night except for the sinister phrase 'Ta da!'  Anyway, scientists are also no slouches when it comes to Jedi Mind Tricks. While pondering the perplexing but rather otiose question of ' Why Asparagus Makes Your Wee Smell  [www.bbc.com] ', scientists managed to convince a bunch of strangers to eat the vegetable and then sniff their own and each other's urine. Seriously, how do you convince total strangers to eat vegetables?  The reason why scientists are so good at mind manipulation is because they do a lot of research in the area of Cognitive Biases. For the less academic types, Cognitive Biases are inclinations to think in certain ways that lead people to behaving irrationally. Where by irrational they mean more stupid than usual. For example, people consistently confuse the price of a good with its quality - they think an item labelled with an expensive price tag is better than the same item labelled with a cheaper price tag. This is why people keep buying the same overpriced and over-hyped Call of Duty games year after year.  Worried that their simian friends might be conned into buying Call of Duty games,  the boffins at Yale University  [news.yale.edu]  designed a series of experiments to test whether  Capuchin monkeys  [en.wikipedia.org]  were susceptible to this pricing bias. They taught them to make choices in an experimental market and to buy novel foods at different prices. They also trained them to get jobs in  government  and in  executive management .  What the scientists found was that the Capuchins were not fooled by higher prices. When given Steam accounts, Capuchins would eschew banal and overpriced sycophantic franchises in favour of more affordable Free-To-Play games like Team Fortress and Dota 2. This result didn't surprise anyone except the scientists because as everyone knows, monkeys don't have money and don't go shopping. They are actually barred from shopping malls because of their blasé attitude towards shoplifting. Even Amway won't sell to them. No kidding.  The downside to Capuchins playing online games is that they are very bad losers renowned for their deplorable online behaviour. They rage quit, AFK frequently, and like to render dubious gameplay advice peppered with imprecations and expletives. They regularly accuse superior players of hacking and 'kill stealing' while casting aspersions on their sexuality and genealogy. They also sometimes speak in tongues (which may or may not be a foreign language).  As for Dota 2, it was originally a mod for WarCraft 3 that became popular and spawned a new gaming genre known as the MOBA or Male Only ♥♥♥♥♥ing Arena. Dota, on the other hand, is an acronym for Don't Open Thy ♥♥♥, perhaps a reference to a game winning strategy or an obscure Latin Biblical reference, nobody really knows. Basically two teams (mostly males) get together and aggressively complain about things like OP heroes, exploits, ganking, and useless teammates. There's a lot of preening and posturing, not unlike the tribal mating rituals of the Wachatu Tribe.  MOBA gameplay is similar to Action RPGs like Torchlight or Diablo. Basically you run around exploring jungles and steal gold from enemy players called 'creeps'. They are called 'creeps' because they will stalk you on Facebook and spam dodgy trade requests for your rare items. The toughest enemy units are towers that have a lot of hitpoints and can kill you in a few hits. With lots of practice you should be able to take one down solo with no more than 6 or 7 deaths while teammates encourage you with their battle cries of 'Stop feeding!' Whatever that means. It's probably an abbreviation for 'Stop feeding the Beast!' A statement of reverence for your amazing tower soloing skills.  Because MOBAs are so popular (and hence profitable), the market is being saturated by companies pining for a profit churning them out. It's like those game shows where contestants are put into a glass box filled with money, and a fan blows the money around and they have to grab as much as they can before the time runs out. At the moment, the most popular MOBAs are League of Legends and Dota 2. Blizzard's new Heroes of the Storm will likely make an impact somewhere between 'Meh' and 'Whatever'. Although WoW fans will probably be mad for it, if they can tear themselves away from WoW long enough to play a game. Blizzard is the company famous for rewarding their loyal customers with laggy online-only single player games.  Although the majority of MOBAs are F2P, they have different business models. In Dota 2 all heroes are immediately available with only cosmetic items available for purchase. Others like LoL and HotS favour a rotating roster of free characters, with a permanent character unlock available for cash. For those credit card warriors with more money than good sense looking to supplement their lack of skills with debt, this is probably not the game for you. For everyone else, Dota 2 is free, so try it out risk-free, or not.",

I have played this game for 3 years and loved it, that is, until ranked matchmaking. Ranked matchmaking is the worst thing you can add to a TEAM based game. The thing is, you very rarily will get a team on your skill level. Therefore in the first 10 ranked games, which is your rating period, you will probably have garbage teammates. This will make you lose the game, and your rank is based on win-loss for some reason. So say you have 7 bad games and 3 good games in ranked. All due to team flunking, your rank will suffer, easily &lt;2000. Which is the scrub teir, MEANING, you will not be able to raise your rank due to the trash you will be put with. I would fix this by making the rank system depend on: xpm, gpm, kdr, support items used, wards placed and destroyed, towers destroyed, assists. Rather than just wins and losses.  Another complaint I have about this game is the ridiculously toxic community, you could miss one last hit (how you get gold) and they will call you out on being an 'autistic muslim with downs.' Ive heard that one a lot recently. The reports on comm abuse don't do anything unless the entire team reports them, and most people dont report just because they dont care.  The game itself is AMAZING, getting a team together is how you have to play though, if you arent severly masochistic.  Thank You",

With over 100 unique and original heroes to choose from all from the start (no unlocking required), and how difficult, occasionally cruel, and complex Defence Of The Ancients 2 is, it'll be an extremely rewarding and satisfying experience whenever you emerge victorious from a match after reducing the enemies' base to rubble.

            "review_text": "This game... This game is so much fun. I had never played a MOBA before Dota 2, and I thought I never would. If you didn't know what a MOBA was, it's a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena. There are 10 people in a game, 5 on each team. You pick a hero out of 100+ heroes and fight together as a team and hopefully win. It sounds straight forward, but there is a lot of strategy involved and you have to think before you act.  I remember hearing about it a lot while it was in Beta, but never really took an interest in it. But when it officially realized, I took a stab at it and never look back. I now have about 140 hours on it, and I've been playing it for a couple months. It is that fun.  But if you have never played a MOBA before, it has a VERY steep learning curve. I remember going into my first online game after the training and was for some reason in the All Pick gamemode (I'll get to the gamemodes later) for some reason and played as Bristleback as he look really awesome. I though I would do good... I was wrong, so wrong. I did sooooo bad, so, so bad. I recommend you look up some guides and videos before you jump into online. Also, play a lot of bot games before online too.  When you start playing online, choose the Limited Heroes mode. The LM mode is where you can choose out of the 20 easiest heroes and hopefully play against other new people. This is where everyone should start. The other gamemodes are Single Draft, you choose out of 3 randomly chosen heroes, Least Played, you can choose out of your leasted played heroes, All Pick, where you can choose any hero, Captains Draft, you get assigned a captain who assigns and bans heroes for you from a limited hero pool, Captains Mode, the same as Captains Draft, but you can pick and ban all the heroes in the game, not just some, Random Draft, you choose a hero out of a pool of 20 heroes, everyone takes turns, and All Random, you get assigned a random hero.  Dota 2 is a free to play game, but it is NOT pay to win. Everything you can buy are all cosmetic and do not affect gameplay.  When you are in your match, there will be things called 'Towers', you want to protect yours and destroy the other teams. There are also little minions called Creeps, they are more important than you think. They go up with you in the Lanes, which there are 3 of. A bottom, middle, and top lane. Your prized possesion and most valuable structure is your Ancient. If you destroy the other teams, you win, if they destroy yours, you lose. Simple. There is also a big monseter called Roshan. If you kill him, he drops an item call the Aegis of the Immortal. Whoever picks it up will resurrect at the spot they died.  There is some more in depth stuff in the game, but this is a review, not a guide.   So there it is. my review for Dota 2. It is a very, very fun and addicting MOBA with a steep learning curve.  if you just want a score, I would give it a 9.5/10. Not a 10 because of it's steep learning curve preventing some players getting into the game.  Thanks for reading! :) Also, this was my first Steam review, feed back is appreciated.",

I will only recommend DotA 2 for anyone who wants a challenge. DotA 2 is not your average game to destress. In fact, it is quite the opposite. DotA 2 will make you pull your hair out, smash your headphones in frustration and spam Alt-LeftClicks. But why do I still play it? Little can beat that satisfaction you get from beating the enemies after a long 60+ minutes match, the feeling of accomplishment when you escape with 1 Hp or the rush of adrenaline when you jump into all 5 enemies, ready to use the biggest ultimate of your life.  The skill ceiling of DotA 2 is only as high as the sky. It's reachable, but it is not exactly very easy to be a master. 110 Heroes to choose from, 110 Heroes to master. Its up to you and your patience to master them. Some heroes are definitely easier than others, and vice versa.   DotA 2 also is somewhat like the real world. There are tons of people who will critise and put you down, and you must have the peserverance to keep moving forward.   Also, Some things to take note of if you are playing in the SouthEast Asia region and below the 'average' skill of players (e.g. when you are first starting out) Pinoys who lack humility and overloads everyone with insults + chat/mic spam Singaporeans whose ego is too big  Ultimately, it is still your Choice. If you enjoy a challenge, DotA 2 may be the game for you. If not, thanks for reading my review.",

Dota 2 is a game where you have two teams, Dire and whatever that other thing is, and a large array of characters and gear.. The only problem about gear is that you need it to suit your kind of character, an example would be that mages require wisdom and archers need agility! I played this game a fair bit, so i have lets say, moderate skills.. I'm a big range guy. But anyways back to the point. Dota 2 is wonderful for a F2P game, and can really bring out the inner gamer in you. Along with its entertaining feel, it can unlock a land of oppurtunities such as the Championships.. This game deserves a whopping 9.5/10 which trasnlates to a gold in my rating system..",

The gameplay is pretty good too, but the game really depends on the early and late game stages, as games have been turned around from megas.   However, the community, on the other hand... The majority just instant pick heroes they want to play, and generally feed. Supports try to last hit instead of denying and harassing the enemies to create space for their carries to farm, which would generally mean that they lose. Another downfall would be that there are a lot, and I mean A LOT of non English players on the Australian servers, not showing cooperation and team work, becoming dependent on themselves, which I think is irritating.  We all have to admit on something...  Meepo is the best hero that the game has to offer. 8^)",

When I first started I felt like I was doing bad but once I got my MMR I realised how good I actually was. I was put at 1 MMR IMMEDIATLY. When this happened I jumped into the air and screamed. I was literally the best person to ever play this game with very few hours. I told my parents (who didnt give a ♥♥♥♥) and my friends who made fun of me calling me trash prob because of jealousy. My second game I played I also won cause I am best but something weird happened I gained points so I was rank 25. I got scared and I cried all night but I knew I could fix it. My next game I lost because people were yelling at me for rushing a heart (like why wouldnt you do this on a Crystal Maiden, it is more health and regen) and we lost before I could complete it (typical team mates) but I realised I was back down to 1 MMR becaue Valve like my strat so much. My next game I rushed rapier on techies becaue it is even more damage and I was able to complete it this time but since my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ team mates didnt help me, rat I died and lost the rapier which was picked up on a Phantom Assassin who wi[ed my team in one hit since no one on my team rushed a heart making us lose again. At the end of the match I waited for my new MMR while my team was yelling at me for some reason even though they were the reason we lost. Then I saw it, I was rank one still, I couldnt believe it so I now do rapier and heart strats every game cause I am the best and I know how to keep my rank. That being said you are probly wondering who I endorse for the arcana cause of my mad skills. Well it is simple Vote IO for Arcana",

You must understand that yes, it really does take over 100 hours just to get a grasp of all the basics, but you can improve faster if you take the time to read what things do. Once you understand all the interactions in the game, you'll remember everything you need to in no time. It can be fun figuring it all out for yourself!  Remember to relax and that you  will  lose a bunch of your early games. You will probably get raged at, but you should simply ignore the insults! Rage doesn't help the team win and you shouldn't complain or rage back. Taking a breath and encouraging the team to move forward with helpful suggestions will alleviate the tunnel vision received from getting needlessly angry. Even if you lose, you can still have fun and will have still learned a wealth of information!  Once you accept all that, you can easily enjoy the game. There will be plenty of great times had, don't let anything stop you from reaching your wins!  The most important thing to remember is to have  fun  and  learn  during all that time, because you will be spending a lot of time getting to know the game.  A personal recommendation of mine:  Get involved in the forums and keep up with the metagame. It ebbs and flows every few months with the trends players follow, changing seasonally. You have plenty of time to learn and your previous knowledge is still useful and never wasted by a balance patch. On the forums you can find like-minded individuals who can provide feedback on your questions and thoughts, and with the guidance of others you'll never feel lost.   To the Veteran   Dota 2 is  the  game to play if you like this genre. With over 10 years of refinement the balance is unparalleled by any other game of its kind. Pretty much the best of what you're looking for.  So to all I say: dive in! It's completely free to play and definitely worth every delicious hour spent playing.",

If you the player with 3k about a raising of MMR it is worth forgetting in principle because it isn't real, behind an exception if you aren't a GOD. And if one player bowled off, the statistics is set off by everything, considering that every 3rd game leave. But all team is guilty.  Things in which constantly I trade it too separate conversation. In my opinion things of a rarity of Immortal have to be much more than simply shining stick, we play not Harry Potter.... As a result of Immortal and rare don't differ than, only in the price, and the prices such establish I even I have no idea what fools... (it is a pity that it is impossible to use foul language) But from year to year it doesn't change, but money flows the river. Hi to school students.)  As a result really good players, about myself I don't speak, I now about PRO of players which it bored and they go to other games, stabler and which to play validly it becomes interesting and the same SC, HotS.  It it is possible to play adequately with friends or a lobby, and about solo I already spoke, garbage.  The most interesting that everyone tries to convince you that you are guilty of everything and nobody else even if you also pull out also holes of these little fools.  Well good luck to you in conquest children.) ________________________________________________________________________________ Единственное что нужно разработчикам игры - это выкачивание денег из мажоров и школьник, что в принципе, хорошо получается....  Прошло уже несколько лет, но им так и не удалось исправить постоянные дисконэкты из игры.  + они добились того что куча игроков наделали +100500 профилей в игре для поднятия MMR  Подбор игр это в обще что-то с чем то.... 6+k игроки играют с 4k (недовольство многих PRO игроков, играет один мусор.) Если же ты игрок с 3k про поднятие MMR стоит в принципе забыть, потому что это не реально, за исключением если ты не БОГ.И если из игры вышел один игрок, статистика засчитывается всем, учитывая то каждую 3 игру покидают. Но виновата вся команда.   Вещи которыми постоянно торгую это тоже отдельный разговор. На мой взгляд вещи редкости Immortal должны представлять из себя гораздо больше чем просто светящаяся палочка, мы же не гарри поттера играем.... В итоге Immortal и rare не отличаются ни чем, только ценой, а цены такие устанавливают я даже не имею представления какие дураки... (жаль что нельзя материться) Но из года в год это не меняется, но деньги текут рекой. Привет школьникам.)   В итоге действительно хорошие игроки, про себя я не говорю, я сейчас про PRO игроков которым это задолбало и они уходят в другие игры, более стабильные и в которые играть действительно становится интересно, да тот же SC, HotS.  В нее можно адекватно играть с друзьями или в лобби, ну а про solo я уже высказался, мусор.  Самое интересное что каждые пытается убедить тебя что во всем виноват именно ты и никто другой, пусть даже ты и вытаскиваешь и ямы этих дурачков.  Ну удачи вам в покорении ребятки.)",

I could say it's a great game and that wouldn't be a lie, but it would, however, be far from the truth. While the game does provide a rich environment for players to hone their skills and play with friends, the game also roots itself into your subconcious: consequently making your more and more toxic. Winning is great in this game but losing. . .losing could potentially make you mad, as you'll eventually find yourself blaming other's for your lack wins. It took me quite some time before I realized just how bad this game was for my life. I became a condescending prick and found myself losing friends simply because I wasn't fun to play with. It was a tough lesson to learn, but it was neccessary. To this day I still know people who play this game, and I've urged them to quit while they're ahead. Because, while the game can be fun, in the long-run the amount of pent up frustration emanating from this game is uncalled for. My profile says I haven't played since December; in reality, I haven't played since May 2015 and haven't looked back.",

But following a lunchtime conversation wth 600-plus-hours-of-playtime-expert Cassandra, her boundless enthusiasm persuaded me to take the plunge.   I documented my experience as I played through the game's fairly solid training mode in our DOTA 2 LiveTopic, and evolved from clueless idiot to idiot with a clue. Following a week of playing with actual human beings, I'm now fully grounded in the game's fundamentals, and am looking forward to mastering its subtleties and nuances in my quest to become an adept DOTA player.   The Facts Developer: Valve  Publisher: Valve  Version reviewed: PC  Also available on: PC, Mac  Price: $FREE  Get it here  Review copy was downloaded for nothing.  What immediately strikes me about DOTA – to coin a hideously over-used cliché – is that it's easy to learn, but difficult to master. It's a phrase oft bandied about, but in this case it perfectly describes DOTA's very simple concept and goals – which take mere seconds to understand – and its phenomenal gameplay variability and strategic depth – which offer enormous scope for skills development.",

I like that all the champions are free, with the ability to pay for non-effective, aesthetic customizations, not to mention the integration with Steam Workshop, to potentially get your own mods in the game. I still favor LoL, but there is a lot to like here, and I look forward to spending more time learning the depths of this game.",

In Dota, everyone is so broken that its an even playing feild, and luckally you have every hero to start off with allowing you to be able to try out your favourit play style. As being a huge fan of games, I highly suggest you give this a try even if youre not a big fan of Moba's.  Tip: dont feed riki",

I have just reached my 1000th game and almost 1000th hour in Dota 2 and I felt compelled to write a review regarding my thoughts. Dota 2 is unlike any other game you've ever experienced and unlike any game you'll ever probably experience. It is an extremely detailed, intricate and competitive MOBA styled video game that takes place in one small arena with five persistant players.  Dota 2 is a game that punishes you severely for being bad and making mistakes but also rewards you greatly when you start getting a hand of how the competitive gameplay works. Getting good at Dota requires effort, attention to detail, patience, a love of Mother Russia and many many ruined mice. In my experience I have played with Dota players that sabotage a match willingly and I have played with people who are capable of turning a losing battle into a great victory. Once you start playing you will most probably be horrible but as your hours start to accumulate slowly your skill starts increasing too and once you start getting a lot of kills you will truly understand the fun of Dota 2.   You will surely find players that are better and also players that are worse than you. In my honest opinion it is a game one should start playing with the knowledge that great teamwork will most likely lead to a great victory. If you are not looking for a game that requires good teamwork and communication however Dota is not for you. The game can get very intricate as the skills learnt coupled with the items you choose to purchase are capable of boosting your stats incredibly and can change the outcome of a game.  Try it out, who knows, you might enjoy it so much that you'd start playing it professionally..",

The devs don't care AT ALL about pubs (the matches where people who aren't pro play), they only care about the pro players and how they're doing. The abandon system is completely rigged, if you leave a game for more than 5 minutes (this means if you crash, your internet fails, or you just leave) you get an abandon. Abandons make it so you can't get battle points to level up your profile and you also have even worse matchmaking for the next game you play. The thing is, when someone leaves a game, it simply says, ''Whomever' has left the game.' It isn't like in many other games where it says whether you have dc'ed through straight-up leaving or crashing. Don't get this game.

Classic Dota dominates three quarters of the UI, but that 'Custom Game' tab ultimately represents an offering far, far bigger than it.   The Dota 2 community is enormously elitist - a sign of weakness is tantamount to blood in the water. Nobody wants to admit their mistakes, everybody wants to blame somebody else.

If you the player with 3k about a raising of MMR it is worth forgetting in principle because it isn't real, behind an exception if you aren't a GOD. And if one player bowled off, the statistics is set off by everything, considering that every 3rd game leave. But all team is guilty.  Things in which constantly I trade it too separate conversation. In my opinion things of a rarity of Immortal have to be much more than simply shining stick, we play not Harry Potter.... As a result of Immortal and rare don't differ than, only in the price, and the prices such establish I even I have no idea what fools... (it is a pity that it is impossible to use foul language) But from year to year it doesn't change, but money flows the river. Hi to school students.)  As a result really good players, about myself I don't speak, I now about PRO of players which it bored and they go to other games, stabler and which to play validly it becomes interesting and the same SC, HotS.  It it is possible to play adequately with friends or a lobby, and about solo I already spoke, garbage.  The most interesting that everyone tries to convince you that you are guilty of everything and nobody else even if you also pull out also holes of these little fools.  Well good luck to you in conquest children.) ________________________________________________________________________________ Единственное что нужно разработчикам игры - это выкачивание денег из мажоров и школьник, что в принципе, хорошо получается....  Прошло уже несколько лет, но им так и не удалось исправить постоянные дисконэкты из игры.  + они добились того что куча игроков наделали +100500 профилей в игре для поднятия MMR  Подбор игр это в обще что-то с чем то.... 6+k игроки играют с 4k (недовольство многих PRO игроков, играет один мусор.) Если же ты игрок с 3k про поднятие MMR стоит в принципе забыть, потому что это не реально, за исключением если ты не БОГ.И если из игры вышел один игрок, статистика засчитывается всем, учитывая то каждую 3 игру покидают. Но виновата вся команда.   Вещи которыми постоянно торгую это тоже отдельный разговор. На мой взгляд вещи редкости Immortal должны представлять из себя гораздо больше чем просто светящаяся палочка, мы же не гарри поттера играем.... В итоге Immortal и rare не отличаются ни чем, только ценой, а цены такие устанавливают я даже не имею представления какие дураки... (жаль что нельзя материться) Но из года в год это не меняется, но деньги текут рекой. Привет школьникам.)   В итоге действительно хорошие игроки, про себя я не говорю, я сейчас про PRO игроков которым это задолбало и они уходят в другие игры, более стабильные и в которые играть действительно становится интересно, да тот же SC, HotS.  В нее можно адекватно играть с друзьями или в лобби, ну а про solo я уже высказался, мусор.  Самое интересное что каждые пытается убедить тебя что во всем виноват именно ты и никто другой, пусть даже ты и вытаскиваешь и ямы этих дурачков.  Ну удачи вам в покорении ребятки.)",

This helps avoid power crawls when developers create a new hero to play.   (Sorry League.)    - There are over 110 heros to play, all with thier own unique skills. All of the heros have thier own animations as well.  - Though there is only one offical 'gamemode' for Dota, there are hundreds of user create modes. Many of them are quite popular, such as 'IMBA.' (One even turns Dota in to a hack-and-slash RPG!)  - I agree that the community can be harsh, but that's what friends are for? Seriously. It's better with them. In fact everything is.  - And Dota is free. Unless you want purely cosmetic skins.   PURELY COSMETIC SKINS.  ",

Spanish- I’m ether high or drunk, or maybe both. All I know and talk about is the different ways of having a sexual intercourse with one of the heroes, my personal favorite is the penta, anal, bestially, incest, Meepo, ♥♥♥♥. (But some other good ones are: Tide hentai, Bear ♥♥♥♥ Syllabear, Undying zombie orgy, midget sniper, silent Silencer, long lasting Void, Deth ♥♥♥♥♥ Vo’jin and then there’s Rubik, how does whatever.) Russia- ♥♥♥♥, This is lest respected culture of them all, in order to gain respect, one must be the loudest on coms, and also not speak English. in order to understand this culture fully. One must consume 5 bottles of vodka between every pudge game, and that would explain their handicap of playing the game properly.   Some other side notes of this game: When I began playing, I realized that the real objective of this game is to insult the other players the most, even when the achent is destroyed, the chat wars still rage on. The servers are filled with broken heroes than always win, despite Dotabuff saying otherwise. 1% of all games are enjoyable. And the 1k hours I’ve spent plying this game has resulted me to loose faith in humanity. Basehunter did defiantly not know about all this before he made his song.   10/10 would recommend. ♥♥♥♥",

Hard to predict how much time to set aside to play. -Match Making Rating system is somewhat unbalanced and makes it hard to conistantly gain rank.",

            "review_text": "I think Dota used to be a great game, but got worse over the years. The community got worse and worse and I can say that it finally has one of the worst one among all online games. Icefrog(the guy who balances the game) started to add drastic changes(such as 5-6 new items, Aghs upgrades, map changes, huge balance changes) every patch without adjusting them properly.   Balanced changes has been poor lately, leading to 3-4 extremely overpowered heroes you'll see in every game that will get nerfed into oblivion in the next patch and be irrelevant for at least a year, and 5-10 unplayably weak ones you'll almost never see. The new items Icefrog has added in the last year has been too strong before their eventual nerfs in the next patch, which led them being built in every game by at least 5-6 people.   Also, in the second half of 2014(aka post TI4), a comeback mechanic has been added, and it broke the game. Dota has been balanced around early agression, while maintaining late game strategies viable. Comeback mechanic ruined it just because a vocal part of the community(*cough*reddit*cough*) complained so hard about TI4 finals and having no chances of winning after literally getting destroyed early. It has been nerfed, but it's still there. Many aspects that broke the fundementals of the game(destroying cost efficency, nerfing every damage item etc) has also been added.  I think Icefrog wanted to make Dota more enjoyable to watch, but made it more boring to play in the end. I've started playing the original Dota in 2010, and have been playing this game for years(you can see how many hours I've played this game) and I've been very passionate about it. I've stopped playing it like 2 weeks ago, and my friend who played it for like 10 years(more than some professional players) did the same. I feel like Dota is not the game I played with lots of fun years ago, and the enjoyment I get out of it is not even close.",

            "review_text": "Dota 2 is unlike anything you've ever played before. The first thing that blows me away is the fact that every game lasts anywhere from 30-60 minutes. You'd better hope none of your 4 teammates have social lives, because if only 1 of them disconnects, you get to experience the thrills of being farmed, butchered, and roasted for the remainder of the match.  Another captivating facet of Dota 2 is the player cards that randomly drop as 'rewards' for playing matches. Rather than getting in-game items for your heroes, you get to ogle over some of most l33t pr0 g4m3rz Dota 2 has to offer. Each player card not only tells you the name, age, and preferred heroes of all the pros, it also shows you a mugshot of their stunned face as they get exposed to light for the first time in their lives.  Challenge appeals to many gamers, and most would agree that a well-practiced human opponent is the toughest thing you'll ever face. In Dota 2, that's not the case. Enter bots, Dota's way to get rid of as many newbies as possible right off the bat. If you're new to a competitive, online game, what do you do first? Most people would start by training with bots so as not to make fools of themselves against the real deal. Sadly, starting out against ai is the worst mistake you'll ever make. Even on the 'easy' difficulty, noobs will be double-teamed, pwned, and danced on by the bot zergs before they can allocate those skill points.  Lastly, Dota 2 offers surprises on every menu. Crashing to desktop when I'm trying to read up on different heroes in the included library feature always manages to keep me on my toes. The micro transaction store loads so slowly you'd think they wanted to keep all their items for themselves. The tutorials are really helpful, that is until you reach the final section and aren't allowed to finish after dedicating hours of work on all the previous tasks because the last mission is bugged.  All in all, Dota 2 is a very fun, competitive game that has something for everyone. I highly recommend it!",

            "review_text": "As a dota (1) player, I'd say dota2 is quite a satisfying version of its ancestor.   The servers are pretty good (at least in AU I usually have 30ms -ping after rebirth). In addition to its wonderful graphics and cool hero designs (not pretty sure about female heroes, ss and wk though...), the gaming experience becomes extremely smooth with the introduction of numerous convenient functions, such as voice chat and alt click (informing your teammates of HP, mana, exp, lv, runes, items, time...). They give us more freedom to focus on controlling the heroes and using their skills, with a higher level of execution within the team. You probably wanna play this game to understand what I'm trying to say. It's free to play anyway. You can have so much fun playing normal games with your friends, or play ranked if you want to go competitive.  The community is awesome. Custom games and fan-made 'skins' are positive bonuses to the original game.  Yet still there are things that can be improved. I've met several players who intentionally ignore their own responsibilities as a team member, either feeding without communication or filling our ears with malicious insults. It's so frustrating to see your team losing a winnable game due to some childish ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ especially in a ranked game. I've realized these people don't really get punished after being reported for at least three times and can still turn up on your loading screen every now and then. I guess for now the only way to avoid those players is to disconnect before everybody gets in, if luckily you are not the last one who connects into the game and these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ don't change their names very often.  In recent patches new heroes, items and skills have been added to the game (and some old skills and items were changed). It's common that a hero can become relatively imbalanced after a patch's release then quickly gets nerfed in the next patch. Perhaps it's better for the developers to put in more consideration before implementing new changes, although I understand this game has almost infinite possibilities.  Well, I didn't buy any of those arcana... so 10/10.",

PROTIP:  most people know this but if you are looking to buy items check the Marketplace, you can buy from other players usually much cheaper than from the official store. + Despite only 1 official map, every game feels totally different due to endless combinations of heroes and builds + Devs put a lot of effort into balancing, updates are very frequent + Active and talented modding community, tons of fun, crazy custom game modes to play + Tons of servers available including South Africa and SEA + Tons of settings to tweak in terms of controls and HUD options so you can play exactly how you want- a big deal in a game where technical skill and response time is very important  ~ Won't be a concern for most people but the AI for computer-controlled bots is really terrible, and they play nothing like actual humans. Unless you're learning the very basics of the game practicing against bots will actually teach bad habits and adversely affect your skill. ~ LAN play is supported, however you still need to have an internet connection to launch the game ~ Personally, I feel that although the variety of cosmetic items is nice, many of the more expensive items have really flashy, over the top particle effects that can make already visually cluttered teamfights very hard to follow. As of this review there is no option to disable custom cosmetics.  - (In it's current state) very little rubber-banding or comeback mechanics. Unless all players are exactly equal in skill, once one team starts winning they will continue to snowball to inevitable victory, and playing from behind in DOTA is one of the most painful and frustrating experiences in videogames - Extremely steep learning curve, not to mention the game is constantly changing, coming back after a month almost feels like playing an entirely different game - Like most online games, the community is absolute cancer - Like most online games, playing alone is absolute cancer   WARNING: Personal sob-story ahead. There was a time when I was so addicted to DOTA that I neglected my studies, social life, my health, pretty much everything else. It ultimately culminated in a bit of a breakdown, and since then I only play when my friends get together for a LAN. Now, I obviously don't blame all my problems on the game, there were a lot of factors that led me to that point in my life, but DOTA was definitely a big one. Not everyone will get hooked like I did, but I do think the game is inherently quite addictive. Due to the very high skill ceiling, you want to keep learning and getting better, and it's very satisfying when you win, but very discouraging when you lose. You'll keep coming back no matter how many times it beats you down because that high from pulling off a close victory is really exhilarating. Those of you who have played Dark Souls know what I mean. The difference with DOTA is that you'll never actually beat the game- there is no final boss, just the next match, and the next match, and the next. Anyway, just something to keep in mind.    TLDR:  It's the definitive MOBA experience, but not for the faint-hearted. An extremely technical game. Would only reccommend if you have some friends to LAN with, it's free at least.",

I noticed immense changes, and across the time I have been playing, I noticed more improvements since I started a year ago. All I can honestly praise about the game is the time and dedication put into this game by Valve. If you have ever played a Valve game (TF2, Portal, Half-Life), this game is made with the same quality and care, with over a hundred heroes to play, each have their own amazing model, animations, cosmetics and voice-lines and lore. This game has a somewhat great community (I say somewhat because of the constant game-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who love to ruin my games), and Valve takes input from it. Each hero has their own respective playstyle, such as micro-management, and you can change the way you play with each hero by skilling them different, or building items differently then you normally would, thus creating new ways to play your hero and adjust to each situation. I most definitally recommend this game only because of the infinite enjoyment that this game bears, even if you lose, you can get better and learn from it.",

Although, Terrorblade and minor hereos could use a nerf. The community is known to be cancer, but if you get good enough you can ignore them and outplay everyone with your skill and experience. Just be warned no one supports in the lower MMR levels, which I should say do not get hung up on your MMR, it will improve when you take Dota seriously and want to actively improve. Flaming teammates, and getting tilted is the worse you can do to yourself. Besides the negativity, dota is the only competitive game I really enjoy, I come from FPS games and have grown accustomed to the MOBA genre. But nothing stacks with Dota including LoL.  Update 9/8/2016: They added Warhammer 40k sets for the heroes, basically cosmetic stuff that costs extra if you like the look. And god damn, they make Doom into a Chaos Space Marine.",

For example, the mid to bot Dire secret shop path. I was shocked at first because it's a bit different (But i got over it) The runes, especially the bounty rune. Never have I seen them in DoTA 1. Also, the item system. Well, im ok with the items, it just gives you that sense of achievement. I played LoL and HoN for a year or so and the idea of getting items at the end of the game is just new to me. BUT, gamer's alert. Rage gamers are prowling in the servers. Yes, I DO mean those types of gamers that just cant accept defeat. I played other MOBA games (LoL and HoN) and I've already realized the pain of losing. I know no one want's to be defeated, so do I. But sometimes, some things can't be won. You're no GOD, and so are your teammates. Keep calm in every game you are in. Ignore the RAGE gamers and play well.            Also, don't play with russians.

The word video in video game traditionally referred to a raster display device, but in the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Video games are sometimes believed to be a form of art, but this designation is controversial.  The electronic systems used to play video games are known as platforms; examples of these are personal computers and video game consoles. These platforms range from large mainframe computers to small handheld computing devices. Specialized video games such as arcade games, in which the video game components are housed in a large, coin-operated chassis, while common in the 1980s, have gradually declined in use due to the widespread availability of affordable home video game devices (e.g., PlayStation 4 and Xbox One) and video games on desktop and laptop computers and smartphones.  The input device used for games, the game controller, varies across platforms. Common controllers include gamepads, mouses, keyboards, joysticks, the touchscreens of mobile devices and buttons. Players typically view the game on a video screen or television and there are often game sounds from loudspeakers. Some games in the 2000s include haptic, vibration-creating effects or force feedback peripherals. In the 2010s, the video game industry is of increasing commercial importance, with growth driven particularly by the emerging Asian markets and mobile games. As of 2015, video games generated sales of USD 74 billion annually worldwide, and were the third-largest segment in the U.S. entertainment market, behind broadcast and cable TV.

The earliest example is from 1947—a 'Cathode ray tube Amusement Device' was filed for a patent on 25 January 1947, by Thomas T. Goldsmith Jr. and Estle Ray Mann, and issued on 14 December 1948, as U.S. Patent 2455992.[1] Inspired by radar display tech, it consisted of an analog device that allowed a user to control a vector-drawn dot on the screen to simulate a missile being fired at targets, which were drawings fixed to the screen.[2]  Other early examples include: The Nimrod computer at the 1951 Festival of Britain OXO a tic-tac-toe Computer game by Alexander S. Douglas for the EDSAC in 1952 Tennis for Two, an electronic interactive game engineered by William Higinbotham in 1958 Spacewar!, written by MIT students Martin Graetz, Steve Russell, and Wayne Wiitanen's on a DEC PDP-1 computer in 1961. Pong, a 1972 game by Atari.  Each game used different means of display: NIMROD used a panel of lights to play the game of Nim,[3] OXO used a graphical display to play tic-tac-toe[4] Tennis for Two used an oscilloscope to display a side view of a tennis court,[2] and Spacewar! used the DEC PDP-1's vector display to have two spaceships battle each other.[5]        Nolan Bushnell at the Game Developers Conference in 2011 In 1971, Computer Space, created by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney, was the first commercially sold, coin-operated video game. It used a black-and-white television for its display, and the computer system was made of 74 series TTL chips.[6] The game was featured in the 1973 science fiction film Soylent Green. Computer Space was followed in 1972 by the Magnavox Odyssey, the first home console. Modeled after a late 1960s prototype console developed by Ralph H. Baer called the 'Brown Box', it also used a standard television.[2][7] These were followed by two versions of Atari's Pong; an arcade version in 1972 and a home version in 1975 that dramatically increased video game popularity.[8] The commercial success of Pong led numerous other companies to develop Pong clones and their own systems, spawning the video game industry.[9]  A flood of Pong clones eventually led to the video game crash of 1977, which came to an end with the mainstream success of Taito's 1978 shooter game Space Invaders,[10] marking the beginning of the golden age of arcade video games and inspiring dozens of manufacturers to enter the market.[10][11] The game inspired arcade machines to become prevalent in mainstream locations such as shopping malls, traditional storefronts, restaurants, and convenience stores.[12] The game also became the subject of numerous articles and stories on television and in newspapers and magazines, establishing video gaming as a rapidly growing mainstream hobby.[13][14] Space Invaders was soon licensed for the Atari VCS (later known as Atari 2600), becoming the first 'killer app' and quadrupling the console's sales.[15] This helped Atari recover from their earlier losses,[16] and in turn the Atari VCS revived the home video game market during the second generation of consoles, up until the North American video game crash of 1983.[17] The home video game industry was revitalized shortly afterwards by the widespread success of the Nintendo Entertainment System,[18] which marked a shift in the dominance of the video game industry from the United States to Japan during the third generation of consoles.[19]  Overview  Platforms  See also: History of video games        Different video game consoles from left to right: Sega Dreamcast, PlayStation 2, Nintendo Gamecube, and Xbox The term 'platform' refers to the specific combination of electronic components or computer hardware which, in conjunction with software, allows a video game to operate.[20] The term 'system' is also commonly used. The distinctions below are not always clear and there may be games that bridge one or more platforms. In addition to personal computers, there are other devices which have the ability to play games but are not dedicated video game machines, such as smartphones, PDAs and graphing calculators. In common use a 'PC game' refers to a form of media that involves a player interacting with a personal computer connected to a video monitor. Personal computers are not dedicated platforms, so there may be differences running the same game in different hardwares, also the opennes allows some features to developers like reduced software cost,[21] increased flexibility, increased innovation, emulation, creation of modifications ('mods'), open hosting for online gaming (in which a person plays a video game with people who are in a",

            "review_text": "Dota 2.  Dota 2 is a MOBA (Massive Online Battle Arena) similar to games such as League of Legends and Heroes of the Storm. In this, you pick from a slowly increasing pool of 100+ characters, called heroes, and wage battles against other people online.  The combat comprises of mostly right-clicking and spamming your abilities, which have diverse effects (and cool animations). It requires split second decision making, quick reaction time, and a good chunk of math. Though this sounds bad, you quickly learn the approximations, and you require less time for said math.  Now onto the worst of it. The players. How do describe the Dota 2 community? Toxic. Expect to go into every match with people complaining about the game, flaming you for your mistakes, and being complete jerks. People here are quite egotistical and believe they are amazing at the game, when in reality, they are just as bad as the rest of the team. So please, do us all a favour, and NOT flame others. If you have anything positive to share, do so. If not, it may be best to simply keep quiet, as flaming your team leads them to play worse.  Why should you play the game? In all honesty, don't. It'll most likely consume your time and fill you with hate and rage. However, if you manage not to be affected as such, or find a nice group of friends to constantly play with, it's actually quite a pleasant experience.  Cool 5 v 5 battles, with all the animations and visual effects flying across the screen. The perfect ability at the perfect time, winning your team the entire game. Surviving what seems like a fatal attack from your opponents. And the most amazing moment of all, when your team has been losing the entire game, it seems hopeless, it seems like a loss, but somehow you manage to win that one fight, which leads to winning another, and another, till you eventually comeback, and WIN the game. Truly amazing.    Cons: 1) Steep learning curve: This game will take you 800 hours just to get decent. 2) (Very) Toxic community. 3) Difficult. 4) Time-consuming. 5) Feels like hell at some points. 6) Team-based.   Pros: 1) Strategic. 2) Amazing with friends. 3) Filled with amazing moments. 4) Team-based. 5) Not Pay-to-Win: The only items you can buy are purely cosmetic. 6) Never gets boring.   Tips: 1) Don't play ranked till you're about 800 hours in. Doing so will give you your rank when you fully understand the game, meaning your rank will be higher than it otherwise would be. 2) Mute everyone. If your teammates are in the slightest bit toxic mute them. Do not respond. Do not tell them you are muting them. Simply mute them, and continue playing the game. 3) Spend time watching professional matches and guides to improve your gameplay. 4) Don't believe you're in the right. Doubt yourself. Claiming you know everything will prevent you from improving. Learn from your mistakes. Even if it truly was your team's fault, find a way to blame yourself. To improve. 5) Remember, it's a game. Don't get angry. 6) Take a break every once-in-a-while. Go read a book. Do some exercise. Anything but staying glued to a screen. 7) Enjoy.",

If you don't enjoy the typical MOBA genre - go play the custom stuff! By the gods, they've remade Castle Fight and Legion TD - maps that I've played with friends back in ye olde Warcraft III days.  Yes, grinding ELO, getting angry at your teammates and losing matches can get frustrating and seem like a waste of time. But DotA2 gives a lot of opportunities to play a whole lot of different stuff with friends you can't interract with physically anymore (because you/they moved f.e.). And in my opinion playing a nice Tower Defense map with someone while in a voice-chat call is more fun than just chatting.",

            "review_text": "This game was once highly favored by me (Hence over 2000 hours), but now it is a mere pass-time. Hear me out on why I would not necessarily recommend this game before you go replying to this.  (To save time, skip to last paragraph. For more details, read through.)  Dota: Reborn made similar custom games as Warcraft III, which was a good move for 'Reborn' and custom game fans. This game still has major/minor glitches that have not been catered to for years, as well as new annoying glitches per update that need attendance. This will never go away, don't wait for it. Items won't work when clicked, broken items on ability draft will ruin entire games, your player will turn and commit suicide when you are clearly clicking the opposite direction, the game delays even if you have an amazing ping which ultimately will get you killed, etc...   Remember, don't take my word for any of this, just google it. You’de think a near billion dollar grossing annual average to a game would get developers interested in fixing these constant bugs. Maybe they have other incentives.  A large portion of custom game time hours are spent in a menu waiting, or failing game starts. On regular play, you are forced to play entire 30 - 75 minute games, which will make a 'fair game' totally worth it. Problem is, around 5-15% (MAX) of games are the fair games, and the rest are entirely abandon worthy. Maybe this is how they suck people in. By using gambling strategy to get people to click a button and wait for the 5 - 15% chance of having a good game.   What is a fair game? Most of the time, you want to abandon a game due to the above glitches. Another would be being matched with adolescent troll children from the hills of a third world who constantly throw games because they can't click a button for the life of them. The other is hackers scripting (google/youtube it), which make the game practically impossible to win or lose depending who's side they are on. Finally, another reason is just bad judgement by Dota on teams matched by statistics. I have literally checked this out by viewing all the statistics from both teams before a match. I saw several games with complete imbalances between levels, lifetime stats, and last 20 games stats. Instead of fixing the imbalance, Dota just recently decided to block me (and whomever else) from viewing these statistics now. I can only view the stats of the first player I click on per game, leaving the rest blank. There is also nothing on this subject yet on google. This way they probably lessen the early abandons, and waste even more time for players.  Why can't you quit (abandon) a game before investing 30 - 75 minutes of your life in a troll filled game? If you try quitting a game, you will be placed in low priority. Why is this a big deal? An 'abandon' is guaranteed you have to win your next game or so in order to get out of it. This low priority is horrible because you are stuck with another set of hills children but with a longer game wait under 'single draft.' Single draft is being forced to play 1 of 3 characters out of around 110 possible. Which means another set of imbalances based on luck of the draw gambling techniques, and now you can repeat the abandon and start the circle over again with more games piled in low priority. YEAAAAY!  So I'm just going to say that although 'Dota: Reborn' has some amazing challenges and fun times with friends, the weight of faults heavily exceed the fun. This is why I would not recommend it to new players, friends, or family. At the end, only you can decide if a game is worth it. Good luck.",

You can get offended by anything, be it a black peep avatar, a cy ka bly at nickname, an early pick, a marked lane, a Pablo voice or an honest advice. You can ruin the experience for at least 4 other people and can easily trigger other Skeletons to quit the game by simply being passive-aggressive or by using one of the plenty means of grief that Valve has provided you, ranging from disable-help immune abilities to feeding multiple couriers, items and your own hero to the enemy team for as long as you like. You will always have an audience because you can't be dodged without capital punishments, and early abandons lead to hell priority for up to 5 games that must be won in order to get out, so most people will be stuck with you. You can't be completely silenced despite the in-game mute system, so you can keep spamming cherry-picked chatwheel messages and visually and audibly ping over people or areas constantly (albeit, at an reduced rate). You can use the built-in Skeleton report system to punish people in their future games, like silence them for a whole week, or send them to hell priority - absolutely no reason required. The more people you can rally for this task using 'report x', the better! And the best part - nobody will hold you accountable. Dota 2 is a Skeleton Safe Heaven.",

Graphics are good in this game and there are a lot of heroes you can choose from, heroes do not have to be unlocked like in some other moba games to play so you can try every hero you want, however there is only 1 map to play but i never disliked that becausse every match is different with all the heroes you can choose from. The hate relationship i personally have with this game is that the community in this game can be really really bad to other players. I have had matches with players that are shouting,cursing,insulting other players and all that stuff that makes you want to puke on ur computer. Most people that u will meet in a match will call you noob (they only know 1 word) or will report u for making mistakes or not doing what they would like u to do. Lucky enough i also meet friendly people on this game (rarely though) or people that help u or who are chill about losing sometimes. It is a game after all people ! I admit it is better to win a game but sometimes people can be so rude to eachother :-(   If u however have a good team and nice people to play with and having a good match then its an awesome feeling :-)  After 990 hours i still have my love-hate relationship with this game :p  If u think this game is nothing for you or u dont think to like moba games, just try it. I tryed it once and well 990 hours later....",

            "review_text": "Dota 2 is the spiritual successor to the Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne custom game 'Defense of the Ancients: Allstars,' in which the player controls a single hero unit in a battle to level up, collect loot, and destroy the enemy's structures, all within a typical 30-45-minute experience. Games can be longer or shorter, but typically fall within that window. As the metagame has changed due to content update patches, games have grown shorter over the years, but in the past, Dota was likened to 'World of Warcraft in an hour.' It is an accurate analogy, as the player experiences many traditional RPG elements while competing head-to-head against other players.  Dota 2 is an incredibly complex, strategy-driven, competitive game. With over 100 individual, unique heroes from which to choose, as well as a variety of different game modes to mix up the drafting process, each game is an experience unto itself. No two games will ever be identical.  The one thing standing in the way of most players new to the genre of MOBAs is the unforgiving nature of the game. For better or worse, each mistake a player makes can be critical in the final outcome of the game, especially as the clock ticks on. In a couple of seconds, the entire tide of the game could swing heavily from one team to the other's if even one costly mistake is made. As a result of this, many players have developed a rather distasteful attitude toward others when mistakes are made. A word that is often thrown around is 'toxic,' which isn't inaccurate; the toxicity of the community can be a terrible deterrent to new players, and can actively inhibit growth of the game.  Thankfully, Valve have implemented ways in which to curb these behaviors through punishments dished out to players with nasty attitudes. Each player is given a number of 'reports' per week, which can be issued against other players who have exhibited poor form, rudeness, excessive communication spam, or other infractions, and as a player accrues reports, he or she may face a communication mute or a number of games in the 'low priority' queue, which is sort of like rehabilitation back into society.  While I have spent a lot of time talking about the negative aspects of the game, I want to stress that I have been playing Dota since 2004, and I don't see a stopping point in sight even yet. I am consistently captivated by the dynamic and interesting nature of the game, of each individual game, to offer me a unique, fun, and rewarding trade-off for my time commitment. There are few feelings in gaming as satisfying and enjoyable as coming away from a game with a hard-fought win against other players with good attitudes. It makes the bad stuff seem trivial by comparison.  In addition to the actual gameplay elements explored in this review, Dota 2 is part of the greater Steam Trading community, a collective of games featuring in-game economies and persistent item storage for players through the Steam platform. Even if you don't particularly like the game itself, item trading from player-to-player can be tremendously rewarding and fun, and if you're lucky, you could find yourself with an item worth up to many thousands of dollars.  Of course, with any relatively free market, there will be unsavory and dishonest individuals out there who will not blink an eye before attempting to scam you, rip you off, or otherwise take advantage of you. Thankfully, there are plenty of resources available to new traders, so do your research! In fact, if you need help, don't be afraid to add me directly and fire away. I'm always happy to help.  In conclusion, Dota and Dota 2 are without a doubt the games on which I have spent the most time playing. Each new game brings me a new, exciting experience, and as long as you remind yourself to maintain a positive attitude and resist the urge to treat your fellow player with disrespect, you will agree that it is among the best multiplayer experiences available anywhere.  Learn it, love it, and play on!",

Dota 2 is a very complex game that takes a long time to understand. But, the community is very welcoming and friendly to new players for the most part. This game will keep you hooked for a very long time. The game is updated every few months or so with major gameplay changes that keep the game fresh and exciting. I have also spent hundreds of dollars on in-game cosmetics, so if that's your thing we have that too. Overall Dota 2 is a great game that I would reccomend to someone who is willing to take on the challenge. NOTE: Some reviews recently are saying that the new update 7.00 'broke the game.' Most people are complaining about the new HUD and the bugs in the update. Valve always takes feedback from the community and I am sure the HUD will be improved. As for the bugs, I would say that most of the major bugs have been fixed and the rest will be fixed shortly. Dota 2 is very playable at this current moment in time.",

Firstable Dota 2 is EXTREMELY hard to learn and play properly, this is a proble because many players could just leave this game after a couple of matches. Yes, there are some 'Noob-friendly' heroes but I believe that learning and using properly a hero in Dota is the least difficult part of the game. Second bad thing about Dota 2 is MMR; I'm not saying that MMR(Ranked Matchmaking) is broken, doesnt work or things like those, I'm talking mostly about MMR calibration matches. I've played with some players that are actully able to play really well bur are still stuck in 'MMR hell' with avg MMR of 1.5 k MMR. When you are there you are in the worst place you can be in Dota 2 because of the absurd amount of flamers, trolls and trash-talkers.  Well, these are what I think to be the worst problems of this game; but I still strongly suggest to play this game because it's extremely funny and beautiful.

I can't ever get enough of it, I've already put approx. 700 hours in it and it isn't even *fully* made yet (still heroes to be added, etc.) It's a very hard game to get started with and don't expect any help from the community, they'll just call you an idiot that should uninstall the game. However, recently tutorials were added so you can at least get the idea, but you'll still be bad. This is ok. Deal with it and try to learn step-by-step, insult-by-insult, and when you're finally a decent player, you're never going to quit it again.

Team work is a must if you want to be a lone wolf it just simply will not work unless you're a very goody carry that knows what you are doing but either way connecting and letting your team know if you want to slay an enemy team member you get what i'm saying don't be a lone wolf &gt; lone druid bad joke i know. Also chances are you will be connected with a team that at least one of the members might not speak english but thankfully you can manually choose your preffered language before finding a match.

Don't get me wrong,I love this game and it's roots,and deep below I know it is a smart game.But being an RTS gamer,I'd expect deeper planning and more strategy within the team.It's in my muscle memory to find and exploit weaknesses in the opposing teams defense.And I can't take a single base all by myself,while my team is literally banging their heads on the thickest part of the base.

The basic principle of Dota 2 is there are 3 paths some dudes walking up and down a river trees and some towers. Towers are important you are meant to push towers which means destroy them. Then you got those running dudes they are called creeps they run along all weird and have a load of money on them you hit em and they drop the money hit em for all the money. Then you have this big dude in a cave he is called Roshan roshan is a chilled dude he just sits there and eventually you gotta kill him he gives you this thing which makes you immortal and then you can continue you guessed it bumrushing their towers. Simple right NO!!!!! Now you got to know all the heroes at the time of this review there are 105 heroes and all of them have 4 spells and then you ahve Invoker who has a butload of spells and then you got to add in rubick cause he can have all the spells but there is one thing i know for sure there are these little things called wards you buy them and place them on the eyeballs that are on the map and they give you vision. Now you need to know runes they sit on both sides of the river they give you some buffs like super fast running and invisibility for a short time. The main problem of learning Dota 2 is it is like learning to control a submarine. People will tell you oh it is okay just ignore all these buttons just use the joistick it will be fine and then you are like okay cool. So you start controling it all of a sudden he starts hitting you and screams why are you not getting this you should have bought a Armlet on a Wraith king you idiot you should have put the ward there. Anyway now you need to learn all the items there are like 100 items or more and then people will tell you it is easy just get some boots and and a clarity and some tangos you will be fine NO!!!!! there are so many items and you need to pick it according to your heroe and your role ingame. Essentially Dota 2 is pit where you throw in all your time all your energy and any chance to ever see a pair of human ♥♥♥♥ again are gone thanks to Dota 2 stay away just STAY AWAY STAY AWAY. Anyway now that i am done writing this review im gonna go back and play Dota 2.",

That is expected from a free game however. Once you get past that bad part of the community you may find a team who is really good and matches eachother and is really professional when you play them.

Valve is doing a great job keeping the community active and keeping the game up to date with balances and new heroes.

Then is dis win/loss system continues wit dis kind of peopls then it could be rather say that MMR is luck game wit good teammates matchmaking or bad day for getting bad teammate wit poorskills ability.

If you can take on a terrible community, go on 30 losing streaks due to team, and not buy a single cosmetic, go for it.  PROS: Great game. Gameplay is difficult, intricate and requires great amount of logic. Some people are nice enough, but it's pretty rare. Winning games is very emotionally rewarding too.  CONS: Community is terrible. Rascism is prevalent, from people screaming at Russians for feeding, to screaming at Peruvians for playing Dota 2. The way Valve deals with its community problems in Dota is terrible. Bad behaviour is often punished so insignificantly that the violator will simply continue, while people who are disconnected due to Valve's terrible server are punished equally to the violators.  Also, this game is amazingly addicting. You can play with your friends all the time, and have no fun (since you kill everything), or go solo. If you win, you want to play another match to feel the satisfaction again, however if you lose, you just say 'one more, one more match then I quit' until you win, and then restart the cycle.   MOBA's in general I find have a terrible community.   10/10 gameplay 2/10 community  Last note: However bad the community is, THIS GAME IS AMAZING TO WATCH OTHERS PLAY.

Knowledge from experience was a huge factor in games, now they want to make it more acessable and friendly to beginners, basically it is looking more and more like league every patch.   And why would they want this? Idk fam, maybe look at how many people play DOTA vs how many people play League, veteran players were happy with the way it was, content with SnowToad mixing it up with balancing and maybe adding new heroes.

There is nothing much to say in advance really, the graphics are mesmerising(more of an eye candy to be accurate), the gameplay is fun and addictive despite being in-depth and chellenging as you progresses throughout the game.  Cons :- -Toxicity of most of the member of the dota 2 community, yes.TOXICITY.Although it is irrasional to say this, but it takes a while to level up your dota.  Conclusion :- -I'd recommend this game to anyone who wants an enjoyable gaming experience and competitive environment. Remember to be cautious and matured as you'll be facing angry kids throughout the matches, kek.",

This game is full of variables, all of which can add up to an amazing concotion, or an epic failure. It all depends on you to decide which you'll take.  It does take a long time to 'learn the ropes', if you have friends who are good players in Dota 2, ask them for all the help you can, if they are willing to teach and help you, gather all the information you can.   Find your Hero. Melee, Ranged or Magic? Strength, Agility or Wisdom?  If you like MOBAs like LoL or Smite, then you definately have to try this game out.

Players take turns moving forward along a prescribed track and shooting bean bags at their opponent’s ship. A hit on one of the side panels will force it to pop off and give the player a free shot at the other side; a hit forcing the sail off becalms the ship for a turn.  To add to the pirate flavor, each player also has an eye patch. Wearing these will slightly affect depth perception and add a marginal bit of sport to the shooting.  This game retailed for the somewhat impressive sum of $16 back in 1962. With its huge plastic ships (close to a foot long), giant vinyl play mat, and the eye patches, it may well stand as one of the more overproduced games of the early 1960s. Dota 2.",

After the release of the original Dota map in 2003, the WarCraft 3 community began producing a long line of Dota spin-offs, sequels and mods (just as Eul, Dota's creator, had used AoS as inspiration for Dota itself), which culminated in the release of DotA: Allstars by Steve 'Guinsoo' Feak.  Allstars would become the most dominant and consistently updated version of all the Dota maps and mods. In 2005, Guinsoo passed the torch to the enigmatic IceFrog, who has been supporting, updating, and shaping Dota ever since. His changes have been the most significant, the most popular (the mod grew more during his time than ever before), and arguably have benefited and enriched Dota as a whole. By 2010, DotA: Allstars became simply DotA, and IceFrog was showing no signs of stopping. Later that year, Dota 2 was formally announced (with its development spear-headed by both IceFrog and Eul, both of its most important 'authors'; its past and present, alike), entered a semi-closed beta in late 2011, and was finally officially released in mid-2013... and the rest is history.  History lessons aside, Dota 2 is a game of uncompromising depth and complexity. Though its gameplay intricacies can appear opaque, arbitrary and incomprehensible at first sight, the way these expansive game mechanics interact with one another when exposed to the element of player imperfection is truly remarkable: over a hundred heroes, each with at least four spell-based abilities and all capable of using up to six magical items, from a massive arsenal of over a hundred. Games can last anywhere from 25 to 55 minutes, and possibly far more!  Dota's metagame is constantly shifting, and as of writing the game and mod are at total parity through version 6.80, released earlier this year. On top of that, it is completely free to play, with no features locked out to any players whatsoever. Not even cosmetic items, which form the backbone of the game's vast micro-transaction-based economy: these items are freely distributed by Valve to all players through level-based gift drops and random-chance item drops. Free game updates alter the game balance significantly, while introducing new seasonal game modes, and far more. And that's not even scratching the surface of the game's competitive scene, with its many tournaments, its constantly evolving teams and its own storylines, all leading up to the annual Valve-organized grand championship: The International.  It may be incredibly difficult and frustrating at first, but given time, patience, simple memory and a keen mind, anyone can ultimately come to see Dota as perhaps the most enjoyable, enthralling and captivating game experience ever conceived.

I got reported and was sent back to the lobby forced to wait for another game, When I finally got to play again, I was met with the most awkward controls I have ever seen in any game ever made. I was rapidly murdered by basement dwellers that probably played DOTA 2 every single second of their lives. The Learning curve of this is game is deeper then the Grand Canyon and is near impossible to get past.  3/10 Only play to sell items on the market.",

I love League of Legends a bit more for some weird reasons, but let me say why: Pros to Dota: -Its valve. Just this makes the game 30% more entertaining. -Graphics are incredble, while staying cartoony. -Its fun to play.... ...sometimes. -Its playable But let's see its cons: -The players... especially the spanish ones. -Way too complicated, at one point I could even think you can barely play it -Its unforgiving -Everything is just too much important -The same thing over and over and over again. Always the same things to do. Buy this, level up that, then that, then buy this, etc...  Okay, let's start on the players: '♥♥♥♥♥♥♥', 'hijo de ♥♥♥♥', etc... its not always better with other players, since if you make ONE small, tiny, microscopic little bad step, you end up being the 'most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ noob ever able to live on this planet and you should get banned for ebing this dumb'. Alright, Mr. Elementary school. Oh, also, you get the same kind of presentation as in League of Legends: 'sorry guys if i suck today i am on drugs and acid atm'. Hmm-hmm.  Complications/Importance/Same thing over and over: In this game, as said earlier, if you make the slightest mistake, you're the problem in the team and the reason why the nuclear war has started. You're just forced to do the things everyone tells you, and forced to get better, its always a ♥♥♥♥ing competition. And nope, ♥♥♥♥ you, ♥♥♥♥ your rythm, ♥♥♥♥ your mental status, I don't care if you are stressed enough, we will judge you and if you don't buy the million dollar item that you absolutely need for your class 5min after the game has started, we will make sure to trash down your week.  I enjoyed League of Legends more because I felt a bigger and better space for you to be more... creative and youself. I mean, the players in Dota care too much about the outcome of the game becoz dey wannabee mlg lulz, when in comparison to League of Legends, people will say 'That's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but we're in a bot game we don't care as long as you don't feed'. In Dota? Even if you're trying to say 'I am new' or 'I am just trying' they won't care: You NEED to be BORN a professional player to not be the one to start WW3.",

Well comrades it is fantastic, I never knew how truly racist I was until I played with actual Russian people!   Just follow these simple steps for perfect MLG game play and become the next Dondo:  1) Mid lane is where you are never at fault, Instant MLG status for picking a mid hero just as the character selection screen appears.  2) Pick characters that are easy to play which that are appropriate to your skill level. Pudge is always a good option in ranked matchmaking! Psyche out the opposite team with 'missed hooks' and blame your team for poor connection, then in the 40th minute when you land your first pro hook you can say 'gg EZ mid'  3) The current meta for new players is always to give the opposite side first blood. This luls them into a false sense of security so when you die 4-8 more times the Real game can begin ;)  4) Flaming is not just fun, it's encouraged by Volvo! Why else would they allow you to talk to your team?  5) Last hitting is for noobs and tri-hards, unless you are a support! Then your carry will appreciate that you are helping him/her out with that all important creep damage and XP increases.  6) As a support you are instantly a semi carry. This requires you not just to get kills, but to go out of your way and get them at the expense of the conventional carry. How else are you meant to get items? By efficient laneing and supporting other players ? F**k that noise and get yourself a Dagon my son and watch the mmr fall from the sky.  7) Whatever happens in game happens for a reason, so don't be disheartened. It is the will of the almighty Gabe Newel who sent his one begotten son, RnJesus to limit our fun so that we may suffer percentage chances to screw up for our sins.   Ti5 here you come!

            "review_text": "So I first reviewed this and found this game really fun. After establishing a little over 1000 hours on this game I have a little more to say:  The game has now a fully developed tutorial that will ease new players in and I wish it was as fully developed when I first started to play. The tutorial goes through the basics and explains essential information to anyone who is new to MMOs or just to Dota .   The hardest thing about playing a game is finding a reason to play. Whether for a great story or for a fun multiplayer. While most of the story in Dota 2 lies behind character bios and annual yearly events most the action is in the multiplayer environment which takes me to the most important topic.  Dota 2 is a challenging game, offering a range of difficult characters and with over 102 characters the game is rarely repetitive. Those who disagree usually are ones who play CoD and shoot other players in the face 24 hours a day 8 days a week... and yes I know my calender. MMOs are a different kind of game and should be taken as such. To be more specific there are 1.701821437811023x10^20 combinations for games. Yeah. That's a LOT of different games and I'm not counting the numerous different play styles and levels of players. Despite how fun I find this game, I have much to critique.  Teammates are rarely supportive and in the early stages of learning the game are very negative and are the number 1 reason why nobody ever comes back to the game. To be more specific the learning curve is very large. Regular updates are nice but for those who have limited internet this will be a hassle.   So in conclusion Dota 2 is a great game, rough to learn but fun to play, and it is bound to last a LOT longer than the Halo 4 campaign. Considering it is free to play I would recommend you try it out. You may just find that you are the next Invoker master... Good luck with that",

Games like these also help increase your cognitive functions, memory and finger-work (if you play the piano).

Smart, intuitive gameplay, with vast collections of customizable gear your hero can wear, along with in-game chatting and open text-chat, this game is already living up to its standards.  Many people would hate the fact that despite Dota 2's ingenuity, when playing this game, many people would often insult the people performing below standards. Even the report button does not seem to stop these people from telling you off. But here is my advice: Ignore them. What goes around comes around. Dota 2 was not meant to mentally hurt people, it was meant to be an addictive MOBA game that genuinely gives fun to others. I should know, I have been playing for quite some time now.  My recommendation? Play Dota 2! Why shouldn't you? With MOBA-style games dominating the gaming industry, you should not get left behind! With tutorials all ready for beginners (comes with a free set for completing most of the tutorial as a bonus), playing Dota 2 will be as easy as breathing. Or walking for that matter. Play Dota 2!",

It has so many mechanics that you're always learning a new playstyle, a new hero, a new role as a certain hero, what items to get, what abilities work well. The game also never gets boring. Even though you're always just trying to blow up a statue in the end, there's never a stale moment. Well... Barely ever. I'm not gonna lie and say that every aspect about this game is absolutely perfect. In public all pick games, there'll be heroes that are easy to be good with and are picked more than you want them to (Riki, Sniper, Bloodseeker). Also, there will be people that don't speak the same language as you even though you put your preference as english (Я смотрю на Вас, русских). And not everyone that plays this game is nice. At all. While there are more nice people than bitter people in the community, you will encounter really friendly people, and bitter, upright mean people both in game and in real life. But even though alot of this review is not so good things, I guarantee you will not regret playing this game. It's my favorite game and I couldn't recommend it more.",

Every patch has something altered in the game instead of just fixing bugs. Old heroes who had the same skills for decades (since dota on Warcraft 3) have been changed and nerfed (Ex. Techie) while new imbalanced heroes are introduced into the game. The map has been completely changed in its first historical alteration in the last patch. They're attempting to bring in features from LoL. Dota 2 is losing more players to LoL. And it's a pity that they are willing to cut originality in order to keep a few douches.   The matchmaking and reporting system is horrendous. If you win a few games then you'll automatically be paired with losers. If you suck a few games, people randomly report you and you end up in the low priority pool. Which is pretty much a penalty. This happens often when you play alone with a four-man team.  It's been over 2-3 years since release and these issues have barely been addressed. They focus more on creating content so it drives money in. The gameplay and nerfing/buffing of heroes has deteriorated the once praised dota experience. It's not worth playing anymore. I know a lot of old school dota players from warcraft 3 that have avoided playing this version.",

I decided to write this review because of my last game which I find unacceptable. I got kicked out of the game by the server, and when I try to get in, guess what, it took forever to load. And I think this game was mocking me, because by the time I got in, I was just seconds away from the opponents destroying the ancient, and my entire team trashed me. The worst part was that I was tagged as 'abandoned', because of your failure in making a stable game. I've waited a year for you guys to fix the problem, but I've given up hope. Go ahead and make more huge, but unnecessary updates. I'll go back to playing lower-spec games like GTA V for now (sarcasm intended).",

Dota takes a good amount of time to get into it and be prepared to be hated and despised by other players while you learn, this is very standard in MOBA's and you should never let it get to you.  I initially played League of Legends for roughly 600-800 hours before Dota 2 and thoroughly enjoyed that but ultimately decided that Dota 2 is newer, fresher and more enjoyable game. Valve are updating this on a weekly basis and some of the heroes are absolutely fantastic in comparison to many of their League counterparts.  Dota 2 is completely free and although it has microtransactions similar to League, all are purely cosmetic and you can actually unlock all the cosmetics without paying anything should you wish. You've got nothing to loose by giving it a go but I'd recommend doing at least 10 or so games before you make your descision to continue playing or not since the game is so complex and in depth. Choose a hero you like the look of, something like Viper, Axe, Lich or Wraith King are good starting heroes and go from there.

As this is based on the tower defence genre, last-hitting creeps is a source of income. The bit that's extraneous is last-hitting your own creeps to deny your opponents getting them.  The courier animal system feels extraneous to me.  Other issues include an announcer that makes me feel like I'm a third grader, map legibility issues, and balance issues. By balance I mean that when you die, you get penalized more than is necessary: not only do you lose the time you spend dead, but you lose some of your cash when you die.  I think in creating this game the designers shackled themselves too closely to the old Warcraft III mod, when they should have been finding ways to refine and streamline the game.  It's not that there isn't a game here to be played and learned and enjoyed. But there are far better MOBAs out there.",

Well I can assure you that is false. What happens is that if you begin to lose even the slightest amount, the person your losing to becomes god and is almost impossible to defeat. I know people are going to hate me for comparing it to this, but for example, in league of legends, a person can get quite fed, but you can still turn it around if you are good enough. However in this game, there reaches a point where this is physically nothing you can do. Not a damn thing. And you might think that my recommendation sounds like its coming from someone who is just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ because they lost a bunch of games, but I did win my fair share and it still felt like an overall bad design for this game. The shop is confusing, theres alot of balance issues, the map is difficult to understand where you can and can't go, and it's overall just not a good game.",

The transaction system is unfair, the graphics are bad and can be computer intensive, and it's plainly too complex for me to thoroughly enjoy. Plus the community isn't as active and more toxic when compared to LoL. I'm not saying the game is bad, in fact it's still really good... I'm just personally quite particular when it comes to games I'm really going to invest a lot of time into and enjoy it like it should be.

For example, you want to play some hero and even showed and told the team before they made the move, they ignore you and then flame you for picking the hero anyway.. You may try your best, but since 98% ppl are under 110IQ (its truth) and they dont get what they are doing or even worse, that they are maybe wrong, they will report you for, lets say griefing. Since 98% are not that smart, this will happen TOO offen. And the result? You will get lower priority game.. EVEN after you WON the game for the ones that reported you.. Make sense? No. So, if you love DotA, you may try go back to old DotA game (W3 version).   And I will not write here about racist Russians, whos picking EU servers and yet not respecting the language. And ofc report you for whatever reason they like and f*** your game again.",

Even in ranked, it is full of people that enjoy trolling and will do anything to make you mad.   Therefore, I would NOT recommend starting this game, the player base is way too toxic to enjoy it. You may get 1/5 games that you play to be enjoyable with a good team. I will continue to play this as I've invested a lot of time into it and want to improve and hope that the higher rank I get, the less toxic the players are. However, I would not recommend starting this out, as the pain of playing with toxic people is too much.   I would suggest they introduce a stricter policy on toxic players to ensure they cannot continue to flame. Maybe introduce a premium service, where people that are serious about the game can pay a small fee a be bumped into a different version of the game which only has other premium players in it. This would allow the toxic players to be toxic with each other and leave the players that want to improve and play what could be a great game with each other.   Also, add more reporting or reviewing functionalities e.g. 'Was the player a good team mate?' or 'Would you play with them again?'. This will allow the matchmaking system to group together good and helpful team players and allow the other people to be toxic amongst themselves.",

And then you really get mad and if you wana win you will have to do your best.   Best playing with a Team , matchmaking is really stupid alone cuzz most of the time however you play there is that 1 guy that will ruin it for you . Trade in this game is really the best you cant find a good trade like in CS:GO or TF2 like you can here.  I really made some cash in this game .  10/10 would play ..   I do have 1,110 horus in this game and I only just started playing this game , to call your self pro you must atleast play Captans mode and really understand the game what hero to pick , what hero is a counter to a nother ..

Regardless, Dota 2 remains the quintessential iteration of the genre and Icefrog and Valve continue to refine the formula with subtle-but-meta-shifting updates. Be warned, even compared to other examples of MOBA/ARTS, the game is extremely confusing for a newcomer. The tutorials are underwhelming, and a lot of interactions around heroes' spells and items are never fully explained in-game. Studying outside resources and guides is almost required.  If you can stomach being thoroughly perplexed and mystified for the first thirty or forty hours of gameplay, you will find the depth of gameplay rewarding.",

Go outside, and thou shalls't play in thy warm summer nights and frolic upon flocks of highschool girls. Quit thy drug, and continue thy life in peace and serenity.'   I was surprised to hear such wise and stunning words from a spirit breaker. How he managed to find out my life problems and the fact that I was in highschool I haven't the faintest thought, for the only thing I said to him was, 'buy courier sb u ♥♥♥♥ing noob.'

            "review_text": "This review was posted by user 'cylian3' on the metacritic user reviews page on july 7, 2014:  'Never In my entire life have I witnessed a worse community revolving around a video-game than the one that is to be found in Dota 2. The players are: Egotistic, ego centric, unsporting, aggressive, hostile, uncaring, mean, mistrusting, immature, callous, apathetic and incredibly pretentious while at every loss prompting everyone inside the current game to 'Report player X' if someone on their team was even remotely new to the game or did any other action not sanctified by them, be it going in what lane you want, not purchasing courier/wards or simply just had an unlucky run/getting cross-classed. Along with being completely miserable to be around, they frequently never speak the language in the region you're playing and nowhere else is this more apparent when russian is spammed into the chat at all times on European zones from 3 different sources at once. And if people do know English, trolling is nothing short but assured from all directions to all teams.  Second biggest problem with this game would be the elitist mindset that orbits anyone that has played this atrocious game for more than a couple of hours. Any behavior that breaks the typical dota 2's hardcore player routine of buying tango, healing salve and iron branches, perhaps with some boots of speed if they're feeling adventurous will result in a wave of F-bombs, intentional feeding, votes of surrender, spam prompts to report player X and disconnecting users as far as the eye can see. I even had cases where players left the game because some guy forgot to buy a courier at the start of the game. And that's me overlooking the fact that killstealing off your TEAMMATES is considered average behavior/a common tactic. In LoL, you can even report people for 'being unskilled'. As in, anyone. Even if they're level 1.To put it bluntly, MOBA's like dota 2 give out a special kind of disgusting behavior that makes me feel physically ill for very good reasons.  Coming close to problem number 2 is the third epic fail problem of this game. The match-making in Dota 2. Broken, poorly thought through and executed horribly. You are prompted to select a variety of regions before initiating the match-making system and the more regions you have selected, the less waiting time..  Which begs the question, what is the point with the regional system if you're just gonna encourage people to sign up for all regions? The end result will be that nobody sticking to their geographical zones and not only causes frustration in the form of people trying to communicate and chat with eachother in the chat as described above but also disallows any kind of vocal / text tactical communication since everyone does not speak the same language. In all honestly, this game is overloaded with issues just like this and I would be able to overlook this particular embarassing design-flop if it wasn't for the actual hard functionality of the MM as well being broken. The scenario on where 4-5 organized people in a group, all sitting in ventrilo/teamspeak while packing thousands of hours in Dota 2 each have a very likely possibility to be 'teamed' up against new players with less than 10 hours with no complaints from the match-making system (even if there is a very large queue) throws out any chance of that. This happens particulary often if you decide to try the game out with a friend or two which leaves me with yet another question: The purpose of match-making was to find equally skilled opponents. So why is this even remotely possible? Team-based games with a mandatory MM are supposed to be fair. Not Tyrannosaurus rex VS a duckling. I'm reluctant to say that Dota 2 even has a match-making at all once you look at all the facts.  Even with all these problems, I could actually see myself overlooking them at a certain time during a year due to the sheer amount of possible combinations in this game with heroes &amp; items and the addictive quality the game has if it wasn't for all the other flaws.  The commitment to play DotA MOBA's however, is the biggest flaw of them all that this game inhibits. It changes whoever plays the game as a person. For the worse. Why? Because the game inhibits 'addictive' qualities similar with that of jamming needles full with endorphin into your spine every half hour. It's painful, it hurts your emotional stability, it hurts you as a person and it hurts the people around you and for what? A small kick of pleasure/self satisfaction as you managed to win a fundamentally unbalanced game with an emphasis on gank above all else due to chance or otherwise pre-meditated 'pubstomping'? Not worth it in so many ways since at the end of the day, Dota 2 will never be fully balanced because Valve will be split between tournament-balances and casual or the 'normal' version of the game while repeatedly adding more and more content in the form of heroes.  I could keep on going with design flop after design flop but at the end of the day, this game is not worth anyone's time or dedication.'  With all this being said, I fully agree with the opinions articulated by this user and do NOT recommend this game as it is equivalent in an electronic sense to how alcohol and drug abuse would destroy psyches, lives, and families.",

DOTA is a hero siege style game, one of the original of its kind, it involves heroes struggling to destroy the enemies ancient in teams of 5, whereby heroes have to kill enemy player heroes and npc enemies/buildings in order to win. The game has a steep learning curve and has a community which has always been broad, this is both a good and a bad thing. Mechanics such as 'creeping', 'denying', 'last hitting', 'ganking', item/hero builds, lane arrangments and hero combinations challenge the uninitiated however once you master the details of DOTA you get a rich and highly competitive game. Due to the aforementioned no game of DOTA is the same and you will find yourself interested even despite the core elements of the game remaining unchanged. DOTA 2 brings some unique features such as hero/cosmetic customization and a standardized matchmaking/ranking system, which will keep players coming back. In all, DOTA is a challenging game to learn, and an even more difficult game to master, but it is a game in which players keep coming back, even a decade later. Full recommendation provided you have the patience, and a familiarity with these type of games doesn't hurt to ease the transition (or at least a familiarity with RTS).",

            "review_text": "This review was posted by user 'cylian3' on the metacritic user reviews page on july 7, 2014:  'Never In my entire life have I witnessed a worse community revolving around a video-game than the one that is to be found in Dota 2. The players are: Egotistic, ego centric, unsporting, aggressive, hostile, uncaring, mean, mistrusting, immature, callous, apathetic and incredibly pretentious while at every loss prompting everyone inside the current game to 'Report player X' if someone on their team was even remotely new to the game or did any other action not sanctified by them, be it going in what lane you want, not purchasing courier/wards or simply just had an unlucky run/getting cross-classed. Along with being completely miserable to be around, they frequently never speak the language in the region you're playing and nowhere else is this more apparent when russian is spammed into the chat at all times on European zones from 3 different sources at once. And if people do know English, trolling is nothing short but assured from all directions to all teams.  Second biggest problem with this game would be the elitist mindset that orbits anyone that has played this atrocious game for more than a couple of hours. Any behavior that breaks the typical dota 2's hardcore player routine of buying tango, healing salve and iron branches, perhaps with some boots of speed if they're feeling adventurous will result in a wave of F-bombs, intentional feeding, votes of surrender, spam prompts to report player X and disconnecting users as far as the eye can see. I even had cases where players left the game because some guy forgot to buy a courier at the start of the game. And that's me overlooking the fact that killstealing off your TEAMMATES is considered average behavior/a common tactic. In LoL, you can even report people for 'being unskilled'. As in, anyone. Even if they're level 1.To put it bluntly, MOBA's like dota 2 give out a special kind of disgusting behavior that makes me feel physically ill for very good reasons.  Coming close to problem number 2 is the third epic fail problem of this game. The match-making in Dota 2. Broken, poorly thought through and executed horribly. You are prompted to select a variety of regions before initiating the match-making system and the more regions you have selected, the less waiting time..  Which begs the question, what is the point with the regional system if you're just gonna encourage people to sign up for all regions? The end result will be that nobody sticking to their geographical zones and not only causes frustration in the form of people trying to communicate and chat with eachother in the chat as described above but also disallows any kind of vocal / text tactical communication since everyone does not speak the same language. In all honestly, this game is overloaded with issues just like this and I would be able to overlook this particular embarassing design-flop if it wasn't for the actual hard functionality of the MM as well being broken. The scenario on where 4-5 organized people in a group, all sitting in ventrilo/teamspeak while packing thousands of hours in Dota 2 each have a very likely possibility to be 'teamed' up against new players with less than 10 hours with no complaints from the match-making system (even if there is a very large queue) throws out any chance of that. This happens particulary often if you decide to try the game out with a friend or two which leaves me with yet another question: The purpose of match-making was to find equally skilled opponents. So why is this even remotely possible? Team-based games with a mandatory MM are supposed to be fair. Not Tyrannosaurus rex VS a duckling. I'm reluctant to say that Dota 2 even has a match-making at all once you look at all the facts.  Even with all these problems, I could actually see myself overlooking them at a certain time during a year due to the sheer amount of possible combinations in this game with heroes &amp; items and the addictive quality the game has if it wasn't for all the other flaws.  The commitment to play DotA MOBA's however, is the biggest flaw of them all that this game inhibits. It changes whoever plays the game as a person. For the worse. Why? Because the game inhibits 'addictive' qualities similar with that of jamming needles full with endorphin into your spine every half hour. It's painful, it hurts your emotional stability, it hurts you as a person and it hurts the people around you and for what? A small kick of pleasure/self satisfaction as you managed to win a fundamentally unbalanced game with an emphasis on gank above all else due to chance or otherwise pre-meditated 'pubstomping'? Not worth it in so many ways since at the end of the day, Dota 2 will never be fully balanced because Valve will be split between tournament-balances and casual or the 'normal' version of the game while repeatedly adding more and more content in the form of heroes.  I could keep on going with design flop after design flop but at the end of the day, this game is not worth anyone's time or dedication.'  With all this being said, I fully agree with the opinions articulated by this user and do NOT recommend this game as it is equivalent in an electronic sense to how alcohol and drug abuse would destroy psyches, lives, and families.",

            "review_text": "Extremely addictive game. Has similar timeless quality to it that chess and go have(and probably many other classic board games), where you continue to study this one setting, one battlefield, and explore different possibilities it offers. For the true experience, you want to have 4 friends to play this with, because all sorts of social conflicts can arise when trying to play a very demanding team game with strangers.  Client is maybe a bit clumsy, with many useful outside-the-game UI elements, such as hero information library, acting sluggishly, making it difficult to look up hero information during a game, but overall it's steady, and offers almost every single feature you could possibly ask for, with actual gameplay being extremely responsive and almost bug-free.  Since Dota 2 has direct competition with LoL, HoN, and some other games that are based upon very similar setting(5v5 wizard deathmatch), I feel I should mention the main thing I feel Dota 2 has going for it, that it does better than the competition, and that's character selection. Heroes, as they are called in Dota 2, are varied, each offering their own set of possible playstyles, and each of them having personality through artwork and multiple voice responses. When you are playing Axe, it's difficult to not get excited and just jump deep behind enemy lines because of just how manly he and his skillset is. Then again, with the cunning Invoker, you spam myriards of spells at the enemies behind allied support all the while Invoker makes obnoxious, snarky remarks about heroes he's squashing. The best I can tell, heroes don't really have intended item or skill builds, you are free to play them as you see fit. Game offers you guides and by default offers you a good suggested items for each stage of the game, but this is merely to help new players get into the game, not the final word on how the hero should be played. This kind of freedom is often cited as the reason for migrating from other similar games to Dota 2.  All in all, if chess was a 5v5 game, played with modern computers and had hats in it, that would be Dota 2. Some people like that, some don't, and everyone hates the community surrounding it, but grab a bunch of friends and give it a try.",

The Aegis is used to reincarnate if you should die within about six minutes after Roshan is killed. The regular mechanics are similar to other Mobas, farming, shopping, leveling, skilling and pushing. There are some advanced mechanics like denying and stacking though.

The 2 of you will most probably rakes up the kills and win the game. -do not let the game gets to you or the trolls.

Silencer had to get a recolour because he looked like DK, but nyx now gets a SK theme, difference between the situations? Once money was being made, that rule went flying out of the window. 1 year ago - cosmetics now apply to pretty much anything; camera wards, cat drow, skateboarding phoenix, rowing rabbits, pig techies, ♥♥♥♥it, anything goes, rest assured, cosmetics will never effect gameplay though. Now - Cosmetic has an entire event that will impact gameplay.  Ads after loading the game (the 'news' page usually advertises new items) Ads when choosing a game mode (special items for things like Wraith Night and Diretide) Ads when choosing a character (the game shows which sets are available, and how much they cost) Pseudo ads while respawning (the death info screen advertises what items the killing hero is using). And now we have ads at the start of the match as well. The future looks ugly. I hate ads.  People here make fun of LoL and their ludicrous microtransaction system, yet every year we are getting closer to what LoL is doing.",

This game has been picked up by Valve corporations and is being worked on by none other than one of the original creators of the Warcraft 3 Modification. After its official launch on the 9th July 2013 it has been a massive hit in the MOBA genre. With it being the number one game on the free to play list on steam and arguably being on par with the largest contender on the MOBA market - League Of Legends.   The game corporates a large roster of playable heroes which are instantly available with gameplay which can offer ten times the amount of strategy and depth compared to any other game on the MOBA market. This combined with players who are working on the game for other players and the fact that the game is trademarked by steam. Dota 2 also has a large competitive scene including the annual “The International Tournament” held by steam.  I totally recommend Dota 2 to anyone with a computer. The ability to play casually or professionally with your friends really is awesome! xD 94/100 -Dom ",

Unfortunatly matchmaking is desinged to balance teams and not nessisarly just match people up with 9 other people of equal footing. The flaw in this a very experienced player with 4 idiots will almost always lose to a team of average or below average players, but matchmaking would see these teams as 'equal'. This often leaves you feeling fustrated as you waste 40 minutes to an hour of your life baby sitting ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and feeling helpless. On the flip side, when the other team has the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, matches are often a quick stomp that is about as satisfying as beating mentaly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ childern repetitivly.The rare (and by rare i mean extremely rare) other case is a match where it is actully close, and these are actully enjoyable as they are decided by who play well and not who ♥♥♥♥ing sucks and ruins it for everyone else. I feel most people would wait longer for matchmaking if they knew thye would get a match like this, but another focus of it seem to be the speed with which it finds a match (which can still take for ever and throw you on a team of 8 year old peruivans with english vocabularies limited to noob and profanities.) and if ive investing an hour into a game id rather not have a hasty slapped together match. There are other problems as well, but matchmaking by far is the bigest problem.   TL;DR: Great game, worst matchmaking ive ever experienced.",

However, the penalty from not accepting a match is just overkill. Now, i understand that not everyone can just say 'it was lag' or 'my computer froze' and some punishment IS good. However it is common that in a que that is taking a long time, people will do other things outside of dota and entireley fprget about dota. Sure you can read the bio of EVERY character two times over since you can still accept when viewing the library but there is very little to do in dota to keep your mind off the que (unless you want the highscore in that SUPER fun minigame in witch you drag items in to make a certain recipe). So far, ive only seen a 24 hour ban from matchmaking due to forgetting to accept. That is WAY too mutch time away from dtoa. 24 hours of LP is ok as a max punishment, but being entirely BANNED from matchmaking for a whole DAY is crazy. maybe 8 hours top so that way you can actually play within the day or wake up to dota in the morning. Low priorty is entirely fair (Although it should cap at like 10-12). Still dota is a fun game and i'd reccomend it.",

The only problem of the game is that it is difficult for new players, even though there is a tutorial which tells the basics, it isn't very reliable for new players because it only explains that fundamentals of the game. Another problem is the community itself, unlike other MOBAs, this game is more punishing and it isn't suitable for every new players. Many people who played the game tend to be very sensitive and they will bring negativity to other players who are mostly because they are playing bad. Each game has an average of 30 minutes to an hour. Whenever the game ends, players will have a chance to receive a item. The items themselves is quite random which people might like and people might not like. Overall the game is good but very difficult to new players. My suggestion is watch PurgeGamer who is a youtuber, he upload videos that might help you in understanding the game further.",

            "review_text": "The Sequel to Defense of The Ancients (DOTA) which is what one could call the grandfather of what people now call a Moba.   Gameplay is team oriented, obviously... but, most abilities that heroes have are also unique interesting not to mention the fact that a lot of them have impact in the game.  Some ultimates can more or less win you a fight or even the game... and you'll usually -feel- the power in your abilities. It is very, very satisfying in my personal opinion.  You will feel like you're useful to your team. Many of the great looking, devastating spells belong to the supports.   Sound and Music The music is not, in my opinion, bad.. although it may need a bit more variation. The sound of your abilities will largely be satisfying.. if you slam into the earth, you will -hear it-.. and you will -feel- it. Some sound effects can be replaced by items you can buy, however.  Customization: Sound effects can be replaced here and there, as said. And most heroes can use custom items to change their appearence.  Possible turn-offs:  The Vast amount of time each game can take (usually ~50 minutes or more)  The Community which sometimes can be very, very toxic and harsh especially if you're new but, there can be ways around a lot of it (Will give tips under this section)  The Difficulty which for some may be a bit too high.. at first anyway.   Your Personal Preference.. I do not know what you dislike or enjoy and dota 2 is a very different game once you go from being new and stressed to relaxed and enjoying yourself as you know what to do a bit more.   Tips for Fresh blood; Videos and Streams can be helpful and entertaining if you find a personality you enjoy watching and listening to.   Play against bots at first.. it will not be ranked and a lot of fresh blood use these games to learn new heroes, the game itself and more. It may also help if you're afraid of playing against other players.  It may be intimidating at first but, once you get relaxed and can enjoy the game (even if a team-mate is being annoying/mean or you are losing) the game becomes a lot more fun.  If you join a game with other players, state the fact that you're new! A lot of people have respect for this. Yes, a lot of people will ignore this fact and be rude or blame you anyway but, chances are higher that your team will be understanding and explain how things work.  There are guides online and videos made specifically for new players.  The games can drag on, try to play when you know you have the time ^.^  And, I know this is cliché but... -enjoy yourself-! There will be times when you will be frustrated but, playing should at least in my opinion not be a chore. Play when you feel like it!   And of course, be nice to other people even if it's online. Not only can this mean you get in-game friends.. it also means that you, your team and sometimes even the enemy team enjoy yourselves more and even play better (if you're rude to the enemy, they may try to win even harder. Just so you know ~ ).  Thank you for reading ! I re-wrote my small review into this over a small amount of time so, there will be a few things missing most likely but, hopefully someone found this useful &lt;3  I've written some more detailed stuff about mechanics and gameplay below if you want to read it but, as said, there are videos and guides that state what I'll say and more ^.^  Good Luck, Have Fun!  Some more information about gameplay and mechanics below, beware!   The gameplay depends on your role( Core or Support) but, the vast majority of Dota 2 consists of farming in a lane or in the case of supports, making sure the core will be able to gain the money he or she needs.  A support will need experience just like the Core will so that he or she can use their abilities proper and secure the game for their team but, Cores usually need more gold than a Support would in order to properly fulfill their role in the game.  All roles are important however, supports are needed as they will ward (Provide vision for your team) and purchase a courier ( a slave-like being which brings your items to you and your carry! Fancy, no?)   Supports buy these as they are, as stated, not as reliant on gold as the Cores but still needed to make sure you, your lane partner and your team will not die horribly or otherwise come behind your foes.  Now, Cores. Cores need a lot of gold but, to make up for this these heroes are made so that when they do get the items they need they will be able to do a lot in a game. A really good carry can more or less secure a game for a team once they have their items, assuming the enemy team's not able to counter him or her. (A job for the supports, making sure the Core you've fed gold doesn't die early if possible ^.^) However, playing a Core may be harder than playing a support in the end.. and if you play wrong as a Core you could lose your team the game even if you were ahead.   There are three paths on the map also known as lanes, Top(Also known as ¨Offlane¨), Middle and of course Bottom(Also known as ¨Safelane¨) There are two towers on all the lanes until you reach the enemy base which has a single tower and two barracks (buildings that, when killed, makes your npcs stronger.)   Beyond the Barracks you have the Fountain, defended by two towers and the enemy team. If you kill this building, you win the game! Each building gives gold however so, sometimes you may want to kill the towers and barracks in other lanes before going for the finalé. Gold and of course a safety measure in case something bad happens as the base will be defended viciously.  Top is used either by a single offlane hero (this is so that that hero will gain experience quicker.) the heroes that get to go in this lane alone is heroes that you're sure won't die easily if the enemy wants your offlaner dead. (Example; Timbersaw has an ability that gives him more armor, making him less likely to die generally speaking.)  If you want a solo top you will need to have three heroes in the Safe lane to make the process for your Hard Carry (A type of Core hero) or a hero in the jungle.  Middle is generally used by heroes that, like the offlane, can do a lot with more experience early on and or are capable of ¨Ganking¨ your enemy heroes with some early levels, aka helping out other lanes by killing the enemy heroes.   Bottom (Safe lane) Should have a Hard Carry (A hero that can do a -ton- later on if they get good items) and a support. The support will make sure his or her partner will most of all gain gold from farming but, will also make sure the Hard Carry dies as little as possible or even kill some of the enemy heroes in your lane (giving you and him/her experience and gold and making your enemy lose gold.)   Sometimes there can be two supports bottom to support your Carry if you want a solo hero top, use your numbers to your advantage in that case. Experience is shared around the killed hero/enemy npc and as such, if you're three, you gain less experience! So, more farming, more supporting and preferably also more possible kills!  Besides farming Supports (and to a lesser degree Cores/Carries) should also try to deny your -friendly- npc's if they get low. If you kill them, your enemy does not recieve the gold nor the same amount of xp.  Beyond farming, aka killing enemy minions or monsters in the jungle for items to help you win against your enemy in upcoming battles the gameplay also consists of what Imentioned earlier; Fights and ganking.  Sometimes you alone, you and your laning partner or maybe your entire team will try to kill the enemy heroes in an effort to gain the upper-hand over the enemy team.   Ganking is more or less surprise attacks, assassinations (usually provided by your team's middle lane hero) which helps you kill Heroes, towers or simply farming without the enemy team pestering you as much.",

( atleast give more gold if we killed that super mega creeps.. it give us hope to win :/ ) -teammates DC? nobody cares just play! ( i want some auto pause with nobody can resume for 10minutes ) -some hero are too over power, but some hero too weak! resolve this problem gaben :3  conclusion this game is too cool to play! delete this game from ur directory before its too late, if u late u never sleeps ( just play this game ) hit the monitor ( cause rude players ) burn keyboard ( cause suck player ) and eat ur mouse!  10/10 ",

Alright, guys, listen. My name is [IG] D[andi] SingSing aka Wild♥♥♥♥♥Digger1998UA and i will throw some of my wild gameplay suggestions in a game that is totally not corrupted by trends, pro leagues where people play like lobsters on acid (denying your own aegis because you click like a frenzied ape when nothing around is happening) and totally not toxic community where every Ivan, George and PingPongClingClong is a distinguished pro gamer with 200 years of training at Icefrog's monastery of enlightement somewhere inbetween Tibet's asscheeks.    Anyway i give this game 100 dirty apes out of 100 and encourage you to start playing as fast as possible, to join in most viral addiction the world ever saw since taking heroin rectally, poping polyethylene packages or throwing water filled condoms out of the window became a thing.",

At least it's not like COD where you can pick it up and be a pro in 10 seconds. Did I mention that how toxic the community is?

The client itself is great to be honest, then you dive into a guide that wouldn't let you go off tracks and keep going. No way to buy anything that wasn't advised, the game pauses to tell me I'm getting hit by creeps in the center of the screen, that was obnoxious. Then, after around 10 pop-ups that made me groan, I finally destroy the tower and the tutorial is over. Then, the game advises me to play a full game against bots, in which I find out too late that the 'back' button I'd have found in LoL isn't here. That's right, you need to walk, and so I did after a long sigh. One more pop-up, and this time there's no button to close it, and the game is paused of course. I left the training game because of this bug, but to be honest I was getting very bored after a few minutes: it was the second hero I played, I thought as a mage she'd rely on her abilities, but it turns out she doesn't and I started feeling like Dota relies far too much on auto-attacks, as much as ADCs on LoL, despite the fact that I got a mage. Then,I tested this feeling by playing other heroes on a test/sandbox mode (write that down Riot). I felt a slight feeling of enjoyment when I used the given cheats to reduce the cooldowns of my abilities and made my hero invincible, and once again I thought I found a spellcaster but he turned out to use auto-attacks by necessity too much. What completely ruined my experience was Io. I'm not going into details, but I activated the max level cheat and used my ultimate which could have killed me because of its fast health and mana drain. So in a last hope to like the game, I spectated a game and asked its spectator chat what I should do to enjoy the game. This is when I met the Dota community, which seems to be even worse that of LoL, and look at its state. I got advised to 'play medusa and afk 80min', to feed, to troll... In order to enjoy the game, I got told to become toxic. There's no way I'm doing that, so I closed the game and promised myself I'd never play it again. I felt like everything was wrong about it, honestly. So if you liked LoL and liked spell-casting champions there, I do not recommend this game at all. If you liked fast-paced fights and strategic moves, don't download this game. Heroes could have been very different from each other if they relied more on their abilities, instead I felt like each one of them was an ADC that had slight differences from the others. This one could fire a fiery laser while moving, this one becomes a boulder that goes wherever he wants, this one screams sometimes... I'm out after less than an hour.",

Number 2, this game requires alot of brain work; more than CS:GO or any other NORMAL game (even Skyrim and RPG games with a market). There are hundereds of items, heroes (and abilities, and item combos and recipies. Each item/combo/ability adds a new feature to the match. Like most MOBAs, your hero has his starting ablities and base damage/mana pool. BUT you need to have everything memorized and know the compatibility between the two. It took me at LEAST 2 months to understand everything. So plan on playing for 3 months without understanding how to properly play.  Number 3, the market sucks. I have around 70 dota2 items as of now, and only 10 of them are marketable. Only 3 of my items that are marketable I did NOT buy. The reason behind this is because the Valve market SUCKS for Dota2. You do NOT make any money what so ever. I would suggest TF2 or CS:GO over this to make money while playing.   Number 4, the people in the matches are really salty. They don't know how to respect people, and most of them are rude. It's fun to meet that one person that you keep as a friend for a while, but even then, it can get pretty annoying to hear 5 year olds mic spamming (like any MMO game).  Number 5, there really isn't a point to this. DotA (Defence of the Ancients) is a really fun game that has been sucessful, but in the end, you'll still be defending that Ancient. So have fun brawling over and over again!  Just my thoughts.  -LukeS I_M_3rd",

I've never played a game where you are not suppose to be dealing the most damage to your opponents. You're suppose to let the bots go after everything? I guess in that aspect it's a little like chess and pawns... So I guess I like playing chess, but don't like videogames that are like chess. The game was a bit glitchy as well. 'Press space to focus on your character!' (presses space, the camera shoots to this bare random part of the map) 'Press the F3 key to have your bought items from the store delivered to your character out in the battlefield!' (presses F3 MULTIPLE TIMES only to end up running back to my fountain to get the items myself) My A.I. companion just ran in circles the entire time!! Say what you will, but I was very excited for this game only to end up being disappointed... maybe I'll try again some other time.",

        {
            "review_text": "Why i don't like the game:  First of all and most important, this is not NOT not NOT a team game. Why?   -The game structure and meta is focused on making one player fed and then he carries his team to victory.  -Supports have to stay far away from the other team mate in the lane they share because this way only the other guy will have the full experience from cs(if both stay together, they will have the exp shared between them, so this means that they both can fall behind fast compared to the other team). (and don’t even dream on touching the cs of the guy. As if the toxicity of most players wasn’t enough, you have to only have fun in this game without taking part of the action for the most part of the laning phase. Pffffttttt. Can this be more stupid as it is? Yes. Just continue reading)  -Only one player can buy wards. Yup. The same guy that has to sit on his thumb since the beginning of the game.  • Other gameplay mechanics:  Controlling the currier is frustrating, especially when you want an item and he is going to grab something for another player. You have to wait. And then you have to be positioned in a way that the currier will not get killed by the enemy. As if you can control that (ex: when you are getting killed because of a gank in the same moment that the currier arrives. o.0)  There is a secret store. As if buying wasn’t a frustrating experience for new players. This store has some recipe items for the most OP higher rank items. Good luck understanding that in the tutorial or in the actual custom item build section of the game were they don’t show you the recipes.  You are close to victory and just destroyed the inner turret of mid lane. Then you see 2 melee barracks and2 ranged barracks and 4 other structures. I only ask why? Why so many useless stuff between me and my team mates victory?  River runes. Random spawned runes that give various bonuses. It’s a rush game for them. They cannot actually be contested. It’s” just pick me up” and you will have a stupid game mechanic that sometimes can be OP (if you find the double damage). I think it’s stupid and it doesn’t favor the good players.  Hey look. I’m with low HP and I need some health. Ohhhhhhhhh. I know. I’ll eat a tree. -.-‘  Loosing gold after death. As if cs was an easy task. Let me explain. You are playing a ranged champ. And you see a low hp minion. You think: ok since I am low level I’ll hit it only when he is really low. Yeaaaaahhhhhh. My bullet took 15 years to travel to him, so now I have to try to approach the cs with so much anticipation that even the enemy will know what I’m trying to do, and now they can hit me for free every freaking time. And now another fun game mechanic for noobs: I’m dead and my item is there for grabs (only some higher “ranked” items). Hahahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.  Glyph of fortification: omg. Really? Is this a good thing? Protecting structures for a short period of time. This combined with some other stuff makes the game last longer than it should (in conjunction with players being afraid of being killed by the enemy fed player, being afraid of stealing kills, afraid of stealing creep score, of dying and droping items and being flamed at because you are a noob (even if you play the game for like 1000 years). The game is actually boring because it lasts too long. It’s unrewarding from beginning to end and a frustrating experience, and more so for new players that have to learn all this stupid stuff that is totally questionable if it’s good for the game or not. Other moba game players look at this and say: DAMN BITCCCCHHHH. FK THIS CRRRAAAAAP. (vomit)  Speaking of vomit. Rushan drops a cheese. (not a wood(y). But at least I beg some coherence in this crap. Why food when players can eat wood?)   • Some small things I think that ruin the game  Buy teleport scrolls. With what space in the inventory? The same space I need to have my recipe components of the item I want and potions and my wood(y) eating crapp? Ohhhhh. Ok.  Learning the jungle creeps. Some of them are not affected by skills from champs. Can this game be more boring and slower? I can’t even use my skills? Really? Damn.  Learning the champions. Yeah. Good luck on that noob. Learning all of them will take weeks (at least to understand what they do when you face them in the enemy team). There isn’t any good info on how to play them or to make item builds for them (try the in game item build and you will cry) it’s just looking at people doing things and no actual guide on how and why (DOTA players do this on purpose, so they can rub on noobs faces that this game is much complicated that LOL. Yes it is. It’s too much stupid useless stuff on it. It doesn’t make any sense. When they say that more skill is needed for this game it’s a lie. This game is slower. You have time to think, and dream, and take a bath, and kiss your girl, and then you fail the last hit on the cs. But if you get unlucky (vs a more experienced guy) you will die. Yup. Tadaaaaaaaaa. The same as any other game. Pfffttttt. Duhhhh. And face rolling (in the key board) is slower. Even that is boring. Jesus. Being hit by the crowd control skill that lasts for 5 years will make you die (eventually, I hope), and this is why this game is ruthless on mistakes. Ohh wait. One stun that needs no skill to hit (it isn’t a skill shot) and lasts 5 years is another reason why dota players say that this game is ruthless and needs more skill than other mobas. Yup, fk logic.  All “high rank items” are freaking expensive. Why? They know that this game will take too freaking long, and it will be no fun, then they make you suffer to get a full build before the game ends. DOTA2 devs say: suffer biiiitttttccccctcheeeesssssss.  When you win a game, you will earn some random useless (immediately useless. Maybe useful later, I don’t care) stuff that you can blender with some other useless stuff, so you can get one random useless thingy, and there are ways to take advantage of this, like special recipes or whatever (another thing to look at in guides and make you waste more time looking for stuff on the internet and not appreciating a good gaming time). This is a must for me: a big effort (trying to win games) just to get one random stuff that isn’t going to make my game experience better. Essentially, no rewards. Wow, nice.  Denying. Omg. Denying cs. Hahahahaha. The enemy will earn exp because you killed your own minion. Fk logic. This is another reason that the freaking game is so boring and takes too long. And to add pain to injury: suicide. Hahahahahahahahaha. This one just killed me. You can actually deny your death to the enemy team. Ok, listen carefully. I will only play this game if they make one item I just came up with. The item is a strapon, and it’s called U.R.ACuuuUNnnnT. this item could be activated when team members have less than 75% HP, and it will kill then instantly and has no cooldown what so ever. This is actually the only thing that is missing from this game to make it totally fked up. And another: an item that denies the cs denial. And can deny the deny from the deny that was denyed in the first place. How about that for a mind fk.    Overall, the game looks bad in my opinion (it reminds me of Diablo 2 graphics but in hd and polished), its slow, unrewarding, it’s not a team game, lots of toxic players, the game has an individual ranking system (in a fk ing team game!!!! Wut?). It’s bad like the most known mobas.  You want to kill your brain cells. Try this game. It will make you angry and you will lose the perception of what a fun “thing” is in real life.

It is more easy as well, but DOTA 2 (Defense of the Ancients 2) is more serious in terms of being bad = being reported. If you get reported, most likely you will be sent to low priority which results in longer wait time for finding a game. It is also more punishing than LoL, which results it making more harder than LoL. If you are looking for another MOBA game, give this a try. If you are tired of noobies in LoL, play this and quit LoL. More likely you will find better players in here than LoL. There is also good sportsmanship in this game.

It'll turn you into a monster and destroy your life. It'll murder your loved ones and feed them to you.  But you'll play it anyway. You'll ragequit and uninstall and stare at your library of games as the creeping realization sweeps over you that you not playing Dota 2 will not effect the universe in even the smallest way, will have no conceivable effect on anything. You will be filled with a sudden dread that nothing you do matters and life has no meaning. Basically the same feeling you get when you play Dota 2. And Dota 2 will be your only distraction from this dessicated husk of a life. So the next day you'll find yourself drawn back into it like a moth to a flame, staving off the moment when you'll have to face your demons for as long as you can.

            "review_text": "Please don't play it.  I know I'm going against the grain by saying this, but please, don't play Dota 2. Now, I know what you're thinking: 'But all my friends play it! It must be good, right?' NO. That feeling is that thing they called 'peer pressure'. Of course, usually when they say that, they're discussing things like smoking and alcohol. Both are addictive substances. Dota 2 is an addictive game.  This leads into my first point:  don't stick with a game because of your friends.  You need to be able to judge a game for your own and separate with it if you don't think it's fun.  My second point is that  this game requires a heavy investment before you can enjoy it properly.  This game is a very complex game. I can't attest to its depth, but only because it's so complex that I can't see the bottom of the lake. But know that it's only so deep because it's so wide. And because it's so wide, you'll have to learn a lot before you can swim in it.  The learning curve of Dota 2 isn't so much a  curve  as much as it is a  cliff . There's a ton to learn about it, and if you're not ready, willing, or able to do a lot of studying, you can't enjoy a game like this to its full potential. I tried to learn it all. I couldn't. So I stopped playing.  My third point:  there's no singleplayer content.  Like TF2 and CS:GO, it's a multiplayer-only game. Now, that would be fine and dandy  if it weren't for my fourth point:  the players are dip♥♥♥♥♥.  From the many and varied foreigners shouting '♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥' at you to the suckers that yell 'MID OR FEED' and, when denied middle lane, feed extensively and generally ruin the game.  On the subject of the players, here's a fifth point:  nobody's concerned with the game itself as much as they are with the professional players.  Having a strong eSports scene is good, I agree, but when it's the only thing people care about, well, the game might have a lack of purpose beyond that.  A relatively minor complaint for my sixth:  the lore sucks.  It's not compelling, impactful, or even cared about by anyone. If you ask any random Dota player what Crystal Maiden's real name is, it's not really likely that they'll say the name 'Rylai.' In fact, there's a high chance they'll say, 'Who cares?' Dota's lore really doesn't affect or justify anything that happens in-game. It sucks.  My seventh is probably the ♥♥♥♥♥iest, but it's the one I have the most trouble with:  nothing makes sense from an in-universe standpoint.  Why are the lane creeps traveling on lanes instead of taking more discreet paths through the jungle or just rushing at each other head-on? Why are there random monsters in the jungle just hanging around waiting for someone to kill them? Why does any soldier on any of the three armies have money on them? Why do I have to bother with laning and getting items when I'm already supposed to be a ghost made of ice that could already deal with anybody you wanted? Why do I need items anyway? What's the deal with sitting around in a lane for two hours farming? Why does holding on to a pair of boots (really, not even wearing them, just  holding on to them ) make me move faster? Why does buying a sword increase attack damage for an archer? Why is any of this the way it is?  Because the gameplay demands it.  Because thou must.   In my opinion, that's a poor reason.  So, in conclusion, it's a game with amazingly complex gameplay, but it has a huge learning curve and nothing in the game makes sense outside of gameplay rules.  And hey, if that's your jam, I'm not stopping you.  But please don't.",

IF U R OK WITH PLAYING THE GAME FOR COMPETITION, and your nerves are made of steel, and u can deal with your teammates flaming, blaming, trolling, leaving suddenly, feeding, crying, and etc. this game is a fair challenge for u. this were obstacles along your way towards high MMR and playing with more decent players. and oh, if u want to get into playing dota 2, all I ask u is to be mannered and advise others to be soo. this game lacks decent humen beings. take care.

So play with friends and vocal communication, you'll know their game style, you'll know their moves, YOU ALL KNOW HOW TO PLAY LIKE A TEAM. The other road is to reach slowly an high mmr, because real competitive players even without communication know the game so well that can adapt to each over picks and play like a pseudo-team, but it's very hard and painful.",

Though that same idea is what made me give this game a chance to begin with. I've played DotA 2 for about a week now and have come to the conclusion that this game is not very good at all. Allow me to explain.  Sure, the gameplay is generally solid and relies heavily on team coordination (which can be both a pro and a con), but other than that it isn't exactly a welcoming title -especially to newcomers. With a single map to play on, you're given the option to play over a hundred different heroes; each with their own strengths and weaknesses. While looking through the character screen to decide who I wanted to play, I noticed some archetypes listed on the bottom to narrow your search. Although one of them really stood out to me, 'carry.' At first I thought this was a complete joke. The word 'carry' is usually a derogitory term used in just about any other game, but here it was a legitimate strategy for any team to have a heavy carry through end game.   I can say I've found my entire experience with this game both very puzzling and frustrating. The mere idea that there are characters made to be so overpowered that they carry a team to victory. Doesn't that kind of defeat the purpose of it being a team game? I understand most carries aren't very useful until late game, but still; I digress.  One major problem I have with this game is its learning curve. It is not an easy game to take in all at once. Not in all facets anyway. However you are entirely expected to understand everything in the game before you even start playing. Not by the game of course -the community. I know it's unfair to judge a game based on its community, but never have I witnessed such belligerant immaturity, stupidity, anger and overall toxicity within a video game. You make even the slightest mistake (or not) and everyone including your own team will jump on you like it's the Spanish Inquisition.   I have plenty of experience and time spent with online gaming in general, however I cannot recall ever wishing a match to end preemptively. You should want to play the game you're playing, right? I would like to enjoy DotA 2, but I beleive I'm done with this game now. There is absolutely nothing here to keep me and the meta is abyssmal.   Sorry, but I'm not recommending this game at all unless you have a full group to play with first. If you go solo to play with randoms, good luck.",

Two big reasons:  One: Items.  Most items are very useful and easy to use, but simply don't offer enough in terms of defense against stacked characters. No matter the items, if you are versing a Lion who is decent enough, he will kill you unless you or others kill him first.  Two: The biggest one, YOU ARE PUNISHED FOR SUCKING NO MATTER YOUR SKILL LEVEL Yeah, this might seem weird, you would want people to be punished for doing bad, but apparantly to Valve missing out on XP and possible kills isn't bad enough. So they thought about how else could they punish someone who is sucking, no matter if they legitimately don't know what they are doing or if they just are having a bad game, and it struck them: Let's have them lose gold. Yeah, if you are having a bad game, you will never come back from it because you'll never have the gold to get the items to help you. It's a simply screwed system that can't be fixed.  So yeah, thanks for reading this through if you did.",

The difficulty comes with remembering how all the mechanics work in conjunction with one another, as well as when and how to use them while playing. Dota 2 has over a hundred unique heroes, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, and the game does not pressure you into learning every single one. However, if you want to become skilled at the game, you should probably learn and play every hero. Dota 2 is a highly competitive game, capable of bringing out the worst in people, but also capable of making you feel like a real winner. With that said, it is HIGHLY recommended you play with friends, as the game relies highly on teamwork and synergy.  TL;DR: Play it with friends, if you have the patience to learn.",

Decade later, still no surrender button. Could be 60-0, you still need to play or be penalized.    Support is a thankless, basically boring role that nobody plays. This remains a constant even up and over 4k mmr.    The climb is near impossible.   I have given up and came back many times over the last 6 years, but nothing of matter ever changes. If you only care about playing and having fun once in a while with friends, by all means, play away. If your goal is to have fun, competitive games every time while improving your MMR, I wish you luck, but suggest you give League Of Legends a fair chance instead.",

A mod that has been worked on by many, and therefore it was hard to determind where the rights belong. A lot of legal hocus pocus were going on between Blizzard and Valve last year, and it ended to valve's favor. The Dota name and franchise is now legally a part of Valve, probably thanks to the sneaky acquisition of IceFrog the year before.  Dota 2 is a real-time strategy game in the sub-genre called MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena). A genre that has grown rapidly the past few years, with different type of alterations in favor of success. Dota 2 is a close second to being the most popular MOBA, right behind the giant League of Legends. Just like LoL, Dota 2 is gaining success throughout it's competetive e-sport scene, and it's clear that valve is highly pushing it towards the first position. The latest and biggest tournament was The International 2013, which included a total prize pool of over 2.8 million US dollars, which was the biggest prize pool in e-sport history. ",

I saw so many people with 4k of played time in Dota 2, though i don't know where they find this time for playing. It looks like there are a lot of pupils from schools, trifling nervously while on holidays. Only one map, which takes 11 Gbs on the HD. And for what? If you don't want to become a prof in this game, so don't even try to do that. Save your time. And money, if you like improving your own self, having some chilly staff in your inventory. Yes, it has a huge community, and this point plays a worsening point - there are a lot of beggars, scrummers and children, as i see from the comments. And i can say, that there are a lot of Poles, who sharpen their teeth on Russia (poor men, looking so miserably). Maybe i was an also-run, getting into the wrong teams? Perhaps. But i played the 1st dota, when it was a part of Warcraft III, and i was doing just my first steps in this 'world', i was coverd with mud for several times. So my principal advice for you - save your time, money and nerves, It will be better for yourself.  P.S.: Instead of producing Half Life 3, they release tons of unnecessary money-crap in TF and Dota 2.",

Cut in shortening, using pastry blender (or pulling 2 table knives through ingredients in opposite directions), until particles are size of small peas. Sprinkle with cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time, tossing with fork until all flour is moistened and pastry almost cleans side of bowl (1 to 2 teaspoons more water can be added if necessary).  2) Gather pastry into a ball. Divide in half; shape into 2 flattened rounds on lightly floured surface. Wrap in plastic wrap; refrigerate about 45 minutes or until dough is firm and cold, yet pliable. This allows the shortening to become slightly firm, which helps make the baked pastry more flaky. If refrigerated longer, let pastry soften slightly before rolling.  3) Heat oven to 425°F. With floured rolling pin, roll one pastry round into round 2 inches larger than upside-down 9-inch glass pie plate. Fold pastry into fourths; place in pie plate. Unfold and ease into plate, pressing firmly against bottom and side.  4) In large bowl, mix sugar, 1/4 cup flour, the cinnamon, nutmeg and 1/8 teaspoon salt. Stir in apples until well mixed. Spoon into pastry-lined pie plate. Cut butter into small pieces; sprinkle over filling. Trim overhanging edge of pastry 1/2 inch from rim of plate.  5) Roll other round of pastry into 10-inch round. Fold into fourths and cut slits so steam can escape. Unfold top pastry over filling; trim overhanging edge 1 inch from rim of plate. Fold and roll top edge under lower edge, pressing on rim to seal; flute as desired. Cover edge with 2- to 3-inch strip of foil to prevent excessive browning.  6) Bake 40 to 50 minutes or until crust is brown and juice begins to bubble through slits in crust, removing foil for last 15 minutes of baking.

Character voice acting is okay as well as the announcer)  Gameplay: between 3/10 to 9/10 (the reason why I gave a range is because the learning curve for this game is pretty high but can get pretty addictive once or if you can get the hang of it)  Story/Plot: N/A (this is like football or basketball or counterstrike, there is no story, just one game at a time which usually last between 15 mins to an hour)  Community: 1/10 to 10/10 (This is a multiplayer focused game, and the reason why I gave a range of the full spectrum is because it will highly depend on who you're playing with)  Final Verdict:  This is a very huge step up from DOTA 1 IMO and can be really fun if played CASUALLY with friends.. But can be also be really brutal if played alone and/or with random people depending on your people skills and general level of skill in DOTA. Teamwork will be the deciding factor wether you will either feel total satistaction or depression, when playing this game",

I began playing Dota in September and it is easily the best game that I have ever played. Absolutely fantastic gem of a game, from the graphics, to the gameplay, the risk, and the reward. The learning curve is extremely rough, more so than many other games, but once you get past it, the view from the top is fantastic. In my opinion, this beats any other MOBA by a mile, including League of Legends. 10/10 hands down.",

NO, don't do it. i mean it's great but I can't stop playing this game. I maybe am addicted at this point. I have fun sometimes, but ♥♥♥♥ who I am I kidding download it now and play it until you die because when you die you can't play dota anymore.

My winrate may be around 50/50, but in a ratio of decent matches and good matches to a 'normal' match (which is not good) is probably 10/90. I have never been in a game where: -Everyone speaks english on the us servers -Someone willingly supports and buy wards, courier, and doesnt take all the kills on purpose -Someone abuses their mic with loud and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ music Also someone disconnects every other game and usually dont come back.  AND dont even get me started on ranked. You expect it to be better, like getting a phone upgrade. NO. The enemy team picks axe and meepo, and you lost 8/10 starting matches. My starting MMR was 1200, and even after like 50 more ranked matches it hasnt moved. 1200s. There is no cooperation in this 'teamwork' game, and people rarely communicate. After a while I installed League of Legends, and it was really easy compared to Dota. Turns out it was, and everyone who has played both MOBAs agrees that Dota is more difficult and complicated. I still play both but the only reason YOU should get this game is if you want to get a head start for League. Not saying that it is better; both games and pros and plenty of cons, but Dota has more cons in the community, not the game. Everyone is a ♥♥♥♥ (including me) and probably the harshest group of people ever. Imagine Call of Duty with only 10 year olds, but with less racism and they cant speak english. Overall, this game gave me cancer, and you shouldnt play any MOBAs. Just get some indie games or any other Valve games, but after you read this you'll probably end up watching somone else play games on Youtube.",

            "review_text": "As a pure multiplayer only game, I am very happy to say that this game is a satisfying experience. Not everyone may find the MOBA format fun, but for those who do like this genre, this game is excellent. First of all, it has the one thing that competitive multiplayer games must always have: light minimum specification to play the game. Pretty much any kind of semi-recent PCs or laptops can run it to various degrees of performance, unless it's a extremely old rig. And then there's the excellent business model. The game does have somewhat of a progression system, unlocking pretty much everything past level 15. Game modes and different drop rarities are unlocked before that, and while it does take a while to get to that benchmark, you do get a free booster to smooth out the process. But do note that levels have NO effect on your performance whatsoever, and only matters for unlocking different modes and cosmetic drops. If you don't plan to climb the rankings, it doesn't really concern you other than the guaranteed drop you get every time you level up. The cosmetics look great though. Other than that, the game is filled with features to make you want to immerse yourself in the community. Got quota-limited internet like me and can't watch streams without wasting tons of bandwidth? Watch the games on the spectator mode, which does include a broadcaster mode. All major tournaments are casted there as well, and you can watch them for free or even buy passes and get prizes for watching the games (including limited edition cosmetic items). All of this is only possible thanks to Valve's status as pretty much the holder of a good majority of digital game sales.  Alright, enough of the extras. Is the game any good? It is. Is it fun playing the game solo in the long term in a casual manner? Thanks to the competitive nature of the genre, not really. Unless you have a group of people to play the game with or plan on being seriously involved in getting competitively better in the game, playing solo will often lead to great frustration. However, learning the game by itself isn't a horrible experience, surprisingly. The tutorial is quite excellent and the bots are challenging, though not unfairly, for newbies. All in all, it's a game you will love if you like the genre and like climbing a rather steep learning curve.  TL;DR +) Good minimum spec requirement +) Great business model with little progression requirements +) Lots of community support +) Allows you to immerse yourself in the game experience +) Good tutorial -) Steep learning curve for absolute newbies -) Doesn't fix the solo player's frustrations when playing in a team game",

Which i find very cool.)  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- cons  -Can't opt out of channel joining   (when you jump into the game and connect to the server, you are immediatly greeted by a channel which you join and hundreds/thousands of others have been forced to join. However you can leave the channel as soon as you see it pops up.)  -no preferred player matchmaking  (If you enjoyed playing with someone, or took great displeasure in playing with them, there is no way to avoid them/opt in with them in global matchmaking. You can mute the ones you took displeasure from, sure but you still have to play with them, and thus ruining your ability to work as a cohesive unit and your gameplay experience.   There is a party system in game you can take advantage of to join up with those you like to play with, however like most games i fear party games will match you up with other people who are partied together.(I havn't tried the party system so i don't know too much about this feature) If this is the case then it will be your teams ability to work together vs theirs, which in some cases your opponents could be pros and so you lose possibly every game until you learn to work just as good.)  -reporting players for bad conduct  (Although this is a feature in game, i feel it isn't enough to stop people from herassing you or others. After you report someone valve says they have taken action against these users at times, however... after you've reported them you still find them in matches thus ruining your play of the game.(There are numerous solutions to this problem i can think of, so im not sure why valve allows this to happen to their players.))  -bullying  (now this is a major issue in game. When you, or one of your fellow teammates do badly in a match, because your still learning how to play or just plainly doing badly during the match, the bullies jump out to rage on you. They won't just stop there however. They appear to band together almost like a gang to join your matches to herass you and spread hate about you to other such gang members or normal player (so i would suggest changing your profile name from time to time if you plan to play this for exended periods.))  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  personal note  (I really enjoy playing ability draft, the combinations you can do are very OP others not so much. The amount of bullying going on is a real issue for me in this game. After this summers compendium is over and i sell my items, i will probably uninstall this game forever. It was a fun ride to check out, but the stress of playing just isn't worth the little amounts of time you can actually enjoy the game. I would not suggest this game for anyone to play, for mental health reasons.   I feel bad about the young people who will be suckered into playing this game, only to be bullied online. This could be a real issue since adolesent teens can have intense mood swings, some may commit suicide after numerous bad experiences, especially if they are considering being sponsered to play this game.)   There are many other features i havn't mentioned in this list, however this is just a list i cared to write so, take it for what it is.   Take care out there, its dangerous.",

I've played League of Legends and other similar MOBA games, and none really match up to Dota for me, it could simply be that I'm familiar with it and have friends that play it, but I also feel strongly that Dota has a much better system overall and has immensely improved with updates. The game has now officially launched and I am comfortable with giving a review after playing for a great deal of time with friends. I would highly recommend giving the game a try, and if you have friends who play it, ask them to teach you. I have fun playing Dota for the most part because I have friends who play as well. Playing with friends as a team in a MOBA game is recommended as it's always better than teaming up with someone you don't know. If you're looking for a good game to play with your friends that is free I'd direct you at Dota, and hit me up if you do too, we'll be best friends! Friends all around.",

This game has a definite learning curve, and for newer players, there are multiple UI choices that exemplify this. The camera is hard to control at first, and there is no simple way to have the camera follow you. There is no recommended tab for items in the item store, meaning, you have to figure out which items work best for every character before you know what the items do. Additionally, I can't find any form of tutorial to teach you the game mechanics, so it is either nonexistant, or hard to locate. Either way, all of these factors make for a difficult experience for newer players.   Side Note- Your team is going to be especially hostile towards you if you play poorly, and they will almost never give any tips to help you play better.

Unfortunately, Dota 2 is currently maimed by an idiotic matchmaking system that punishes you for winning. That's right, punishes you. You win a few games, get over fifty percent w/l, and then all of a sudden you're getting match with guys that don't speak english and fail to understand even basic concepts of the game. Then, when you lose a ♥♥♥♥ load and your winrate is down to forty eight or forty nine percent, you're magically tossed back into a group of people that actually know what they're doing. Then you get a win streak, and get some wins and get out of the hole.   Then the cycle starts all over again. There is no way around it. No amount of always taking a carry, or always taking mid, or always waiting to pick to get what your team needs is going to help you improve your w/l rate. It is rigged, and it is frustrating.  There is also no excuse for the servers for english speaking people to always be flooded with people that don't speak english. This is not racism, this is common sense. You're playing a team based game so you need to be able to communicate with your team. It is ignorant of Valve to allow non-english speakers on the servers in such overwhelming numbers, as that it ruins the play experience for all involved. ",

You can also expect to be put in low priority games about once a week because it currently takes around 3 reports in 20 games to send you to low prio. That is 3 people reporting you out of the possible 180. The game is centered around competitive play to the point that there is really no reason to play if you don’t intend on getting better. However the ranking system is currently the simplest and most inadequate of any “competitive” game out there if you win you get +25 MMR if you loss -25 no matter your performance. Go 15/2 as a phoenix that started the game as a support then was forced in to the carry role because you’re the only one that isn’t currently 0/10 clearly you’re not a good player or you could have won that game. The ranking system is so awful that a black market of accounts has popped up so now any scrub with 20 bucks can buy an account in your ranking were he doesn’t belong and give you 0% chance of winning the game. I wouldn’t consider getting in to the game at its current state 12,000,000 players and it’s still a buggy mess with incompetent players that are unavoidable at any skill level.",

Normally, I never write review, but I think this is needed.  1700+ hours on dota 2, okay maybe this is not much like the other older player that maybe play already more than 4000 hours.  I already played Dota 2 since patch 6.83, and I found Dota 2 extremely addicting till the 6.88. New hero, a slight bit change of ability, new item. It's a small change but it change a lot in gameplay for Dota. And yes I already played Dota for about 4 years.  Today, the new patch came out (7.00) sized about 6,6 GB. I don't know if valve want to make a new game or what. I found these patches are extremely stupid. The first time I need to make a complain about this patch. All are new, even the hero even the gameplay. big changes on the map, everything is crazy.   I am sure even all the pro players having some critical thinking on these big patches. I would like to say go on make this Dota 2.5 in a test or something. I am sure also even all the former players of Dota 2 want it to revert the changes. Honestly, this is like Lol or HON, even crazier.  Big patches should not be applied instantly, valve you need to review these changes or maybe you will lost a lot of player. This is crazy and maybe you need to start thinking about 6.89.  I think you can update a new survey in dota 2 whether even the players like these new changes to see what you all did. If it has 40% at least a good, then you may have a go.   I remember the Dota 2 Reborn, you guys worked hard and even applied a test on it. Now, it became the new dota. Its a good one. I dont know if they are very desperate for some big changes. But, I think they need to rethink all of these changes.  Funny thing, there is a question whether I recommend this game or not. The answer is yes before the patch 7.00, but for now no is the answer.  Thank You.  ",

However a downside to the game would be the low-priority matchmaking pool which can sometimes be very annoying as if you were to lag out of the game and not reconnect within 5 minutes, you will be put to bad servers with other people in low prior and gain no XP until your 5 games are over. Overall i would reccomend downloading and playing this game.  **UPDATE** Not too sure about the new reborn beta. It has been out for a while now but it just doesn't feel like DOTA anymore. I mean, most things are similiar but they tried to hard on the rework and made it feel so different (not that that's a bad thing), however for a player who's played on the previous UI it's like they started remaking it but then left it unfinished.",

Pros :  -Very fun, especially with friends.  -Unique design and characters.  -Intresting and classic lore (evil vs good). -Mostly balanced (emphasis on the mostly) -Not Pay 2 Win -Rampages, FeelsGoodMan (This is a personal one, but coming back from a losing position is amazing.) Cons: (Brace yourself.) -Some heroes are as broken as my life. -Community is more toxic than your underwear after a marathon. -Developers that only really care about that sweet Treasure Chest/Compendium monay. -R A G E  -Possible damage to computer. (See point above) -There is no way to surrender, even in a 100% 'You lost' situation. -For most of us gamers, its really hard to find people that you like playing with, and even more, people that are nice. -Boys below the age of 14 are a real treat, trust me.(Some above that age are great too.) -Extremely hard to learn, requires extensive knowledge of the game. -Lose track of time, games can drag on almost indefinitely. -'I have to go in 30 mins, so I can play one match' players. Conclusion: To be honest, DOTA has been one of my favorite games of all time, and as a MOBA, it is a truly great game. I played this game for a truly a long amount of time as this is one of my many accounts. Been playing this game since beginning, and loved every moment of it. Remember the extremly long Global Silence on Silencer, but no one really cared. Anyway, the game was moving in the right direction right up until Reborn Update.  As with almost every game that Valve 'makes', they turn it into a profit machine, 'Skins are great, Duck gameplay'.(*cough* CS:GO *cough*) I wish that this game wouldn't have turned into such a trash heap full of ♥♥♥♥♥.",

But as you get better and better (which would atleast take months or more) the toxic people getting angry will start to fade away. I love dota, it is one of my most played games. Dota is beautiful if you have a beefy computer, if you dont, you can still play it but I recommend that you upgrade your specs to fulfill the true beauty of Dota. Dota also has amazing heroes and so far have no bugs for me. This game is 50% skill 49% teamwork 1% luck, so dont be those people who complain because of their teamates. As you can see by my hours.

Dota 2 have only one game mode. Seriously?!   4. Its free to play. Every ♥♥♥♥ing kiddo/maniac/troll/hacker can join and ♥♥♥♥ up this game really fast. Do you want it? So make it cost something at least! Will be less punks to deal with!  5. Valve steal this game from Warcraft 3 custom map called Dota, because they ran out of stupid ideas like Hollywood!  6. Dota 2 sucks because of its fanbase. Fanboys are so toxic and stupid so they will build their own Dota 3 soon!  7. Microtransactions! No explanation needed here :D  8. Valve anti-cheat system is broken and will ban everyone who have no life and really 'good' at this ♥♥♥♥ game.  9. Its addictive like drugs and Mcdonalds junkfood. I can see your beautiful life is going away real fast. I feel pity for you people!  10. There will be no Half-life 3 for Valve fanboys.

Your goal is to eliminate hot dog storage that's being defended by 3 towers from each side and angry consumers from your and enemy side rush them for some unknown obscure reason. While experience is bearable if you have five man stack, it's still frustraning as you see that your competitors equiping themselves with better sauce and mustard dispensers while you can bearly afford cost of rent. Sometimes I wonder why I even started playing it and remember that it was frustration from other fabulous game. To fully enjoy this game you have to know the essence of Hot-Dog and what makes it heavenly tasty. So in other words you need to read loads of information about many possible hot-dog sellers, that call themselves champions, and their hot-dog making abilities. After you read about them make sure you'll play every single one of them least 10 times before entering glorious matchmaking system, or else you won't atract enough costumers to buy your hot-dogs and won't get money which means no wireless ketchup dispenser. If you happen read all that info and you know how every single hot-dog seller works in given situation, you may start playing and actually enjoying dota2. arsefegits/10",

The match making system is better than Garena, Hamachi and Blizzard; however, sometime, I was teamed up with a bunch of newbies and annoying people. The report system is bad. I want some feedback from Valve whenever I made a report. Other than that, there is no major improvement. I only play this with my friend. There is little to no fun while playing alone.",

Another problem i have with low priority is that you now have to win a game for the game to count, this is a problem because these people are in low priority for a reason, be it too many abandons or too many reports against them, which means that these games are incredebly dificult to win. You will end up getting potatoes on your team that say that they know what they are doing but in actual fact they have no idea, you will spend months in low priority and raging at you team members that are only good at running their mouth's.

There are too many OP stuff nowadays and they even keep adding new more OP stuff to the game. In conlcusion I would say that they spent too much money into commercialising the game and bringing new players to it. I lost all my interest in the game since the main goal is attracting more players to the game and most of all attracting people who will WATCH the game. Before that Dota was really a unique game, now it's a mash between LoL Hos and Smite. Dota lost it's identity and this for a game is the worst thing to happen. I guess money are more important nowadays than tradition which even makes me sad. Valve's point is creating people who WATCH the game and I don't want to be a part of such community. The game is SO unbalanced. This is the death of dota. I hope more people realise the big picture.",

            "review_text": "I consider Dota 2 to be the closest thing we'll ever get to a sequel to WarCraft III. For the uninitiated, Dota 2 is the sequel to the WarCraft III mod, Defense of the Ancients, a game that all but launched this genre of games back in 2002-03. Since Activision-Blizzard is busy minting money with other enterprises, I'm taking this opportunity to take Dota 2 and enjoy it as a sequel to one of my favorite games ever.  Dota 2 was snatched away by Valve Software from right under the hands of the mod's original host, Blizzard Entertainment. What is lost in that transition is all connection to the WarCraft universe, which for this fan of WarCraft is slightly disappointing. However, in keeping Dota 2 as close to the original as possible, Valve took the game assets and re-imagined them in such a way that the sharp-eyed gamer could easily detect which WarCraft asset it owes its existence to. This could have been done only as a means to keep the balanced gameplay intact, but either way it was fun for me to say to myself as I played, 'Hey that's the Arthas character right there.'  The premise of the game is fairly simple: you and four teammates each select from nearly 100 heroes, and along with your AI controlled creeps advance along the map to destroy your enemy's ancient, or base. Immediately behind that simplicity lays a game that is both incredibly deep and with a much higher skill ceiling than is found in many competitive online games today. I committed a full 100 hours of gametime to have the mindset that I am only a learner in this universe, and even now after that mark I only feel I have become not horrible at the game.  What makes Dota 2 a game that you can come back to over and over again is that it feels inherently balanced. Many modern online games end up with the scenario where you or your team has brought the veritable knife to a gun fight, and the only thing that remains is how much death and destruction you are to eat. The item shop in Dota 2 solves that in my opinion. Instead of tying all abilities and upgrades to your chosen hero, the item shop allows a team to read a situation and react accordingly with the heroes they are already locked into. If your team just happens to be weak against magic attacks and you end up against five full magic nuker types, you can still save your match by running to the item shop and pick up the Black King Bar.   My only complaints on Dota 2 are two-fold. First is this infant genre has yet to find a way to allow more casual gamers to drop in and out of matches. Once a game of Dota 2 starts, the game is locked in with the ten players it has. Dropping often yields some sort of negative communication. And if someone does drop, no one can come in to take their place. This needs to be addressed at some point.  Secondly - and this is not necessarily the fault of the developer - is that the players of Dota 2 take this game way too seriously. This generation of gamers in my opinion has been brought up that these games, their outcomes and your associated summary statistics are meaningful in a way that matters to you as a person. Of course nothing could be further from the truth, and for gamers of my generation the continuing loss of the random chaos element in online multiplayer video games and the joy that comes from being in it is saddening. It is frustrating to be in matches with players who are so apoplectic about something in which they have no control over - their teammates. No matter how far the technology of video games gets, this one inviolable truth will always prevail: In an online multiplayer video game with random matchmaking, there is no way to control for the vicissitudes of gamers' skill, motive for playing and commitment to the objective of the game.  Dota 2 is another example of how Valve takes a successful mod and turns into something even greater. If you are looking for something truly new, with deep gameplay, a high skill ceiling, and a bright future, Dota 2 is certainly a game for you.",

I always knew this game had UI issues, but once you get hands on and think: 'Oh it is 2016, it should be fully working' NOPE! Odd little things and arros to click, like the 'download' symbol you see, but inversed, and shown durring a loading player state like...I sit there and think...'What will happen if I click that? Explodeth the game??? Instant gold?....and you hover the mouse over andddd nope...won't touch it'.... stuff like this ALL OVER!   Make matters worse, so you have this giant menu to look at heros...ok, animated little thumb files...you click in, little run down, but no 'see what they can do' just a button that offers you a demo round with them like what??? so all that effort into a making a aniamted thumbs but what COUNTS! WHAT REALLY COUNTS is this shove in load a new screen sort of presentation? OHHHH IT GET'S WORSE!   So go in to play: I select my character, choose the game mode (which is confusing as fewk, I just chose : 'All' which makes you think you are about to queue up for ALL the modes availabe, but now it just means 'all characters available' as opposed to 'just 3 at random' mode....you see it is brain dumbing down UI choices that make me think : 'Why do people call this the 'smart mans MOBA' over LoL? Lol is actually WAY more logically put together than this POS.  So I ge my match fired up in under a minute. And then....WE CHOSE AGAIN heroes...Wait wait wait, oh and get this, it is not, of course, USER INTERFACE FRIENDLY! You have this Windows 8 / MAC interface rip off window selection of characters... you know, like a bar of icons to sift through like a whirly book...so I now, as a new player, I have to RESWIFT through all these champions...You see before, on a one page lay out, it is organized by FORCE - Agility - MAGIC heroes (and you have to click into each one to see which one is carry, distance etc... just bad), but here it is nothing...just all sloppily thown into this whirly book icon thing...so I panic since the match is about to start and timer counting down, I start franitcally swifting through...oh god who was it again???? What did I want? Oh look, that one looks cool...no, stay on target.... AH HA! FOUND IT! WHEWWWW lock it in....  And now another 2 min wait for...I don't know what...but in the end about the same waiting time as LOL to fire up. So no major issues...  In game....ok...oh god...*Insert massive rant on the horrid UI. Poor camera. Bad map movement*. WHAT? I pressed C for camera hoping it locks me in place, but NOooooo I activated a pack donkey....folks...I kid you not. My character straight up goes STATIC, and I became a pack donkey.... DONT EVER PRESS C!   So then back to game once I got that straightened up. I follow my zerglings to the nearest tower, some guy is killing my zergies behind the tower, ok, I start whacking the tower and some one that was 100% invisible unlcoaks, and 2 shots my 'Tank assassin' guy (he being a regular assassin, some kind of shark with invisibiliy).... And THAT is when I literally pressed ENTER: 'This game sucks, LOL is better', Abandoned the match. Hit EXIT: Uninstalled from Steam!   0/10 back to LoL Simulator   ",

Matchmaking system is broken, worse than LoL or CS:GO; while your team consists of newbies, and im not against newbies i try to help them, other team consists of Dota 1 elites with 2k hours in dota 2.... It is worse in ranked, so don't play ranked if you are not able to carry 1-2v5. If you are lucky there will be another guy who knows how to 'not feed'. That means the game wants you to win, 2v5 means win in my dictionary.  3. There is a bug when you have ping higher than 60, that keeps you from farming as last hits don't give gold even if you get gold sound.  Please try to make it as good as Dota 1, since it still is way better than dota 2. I would like to let the legend go on. But R&amp;D team needs to work harder.

The mechanics are archaic, granted that this was a mod for a strategy game that's nearly a decade old, and most of the core gameplay is identical to its first iteration, there's very little replay value (only one map and very few game types, most of which are just the normal game type with an added gimmick or twist), and most of the characters are extremely gimmicky, each falling into one of three generic categories of characters, with 4 different abilities being the only thing setting each character apart from the dozens of others. The game also has quite a few RNG elements, like randomly-spawning powerups and inconsistent damage numbers, making it a joke from the perspective of competitive gaming. But then again, competitive gaming is a joke to begin with, seeing as how a lot of people see ♥♥♥♥ like Call of Duty and Starcraft 2 as games that take legitimate skills and thinking to play. I'd say that the art style is nice, but it's almost all plagiarized from Warcraft 3. Except for one hero. He's plagiarized from Starcraft instead. And god help you if you ever come in contact with the disgusting ♥♥♥♥♥tain community that plays this game. Dota's playerbase is literally the worst of the worst that video gaming has to offer. Oh, and enjoy your forced TF2-style 'hat based economy'. Valve already ruined Team Fortress 2 and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive with that ♥♥♥♥. Now they'll do it again.

Then since it was the most popular free to play game on steam I decided to get, what could possibly go wrong. So I got and looked up some things on Youtube and learned that it was hard to play meaning you cant be to tanky. So after that I played it and learned that it is very easy to feed but that didn't stop me. This game is full of good fun intence gameplay. And once you learn how to play it can be extreamly addicting. My tip is don't listen to people on youtube that say Dota 2 sucks because it DOESN'T! I can tell you 80% of what they say is not true. Just try not to feed you need to be extremely careful.  Another tip is don't make the Russians angry, sorry to all you nice russian players but I have to say from what I've played so far alot of Russians are very serious about this game.

            "review_text": " Writing this for the “Love/Hate Relationship” community write-in qualifcation.   I just recently started playing DotA 2 as you can tell. I literally play every game there is with the group of friends I play with on (almost) the daily. Never played DotA 2 with them, however, until recently.   Always heard them talk about it, watched videos with them. Crazy stuff, countless possibilities, crazy combos. All requiring a good game-sense and immense skills when it comes to some heroes.  Never tried to get into it because I've played a lot of MOBAs (have a lot of knowledge on them) and I just didn't feel like getting into a new MOBA (to myself) that required me to learn a ♥♥♥♥-ton of heroes, their abilities, tactics &amp; strategies, techniques, knowledge on how to counter certain heroes, core builds, situational items &amp; just the store's items in general.  But lately, I've been feeling like taking up a challenge like that. I do not like playing a game being very unknowledgeable and possibly ruining the experience of others for the sake of my newbiness. As a new player, I try to play with a full-party being my friends. This means that, yeah, I'll mess up sometimes, but they'll be there to tell me what's right rather than bash me for doing what I did that was wrong. Even when we cannot play as a full-party, however, we happen to come across people that are understanding. Hard to believe, I know, I mean we do come across some toxic players, but hey, that's just inevitable in today's online gaming world.  But what if someone asks me, do I love or hate the game? What would my answer be?  I honestly love it &amp; hate it. It's situational. There are times when I do really good being up against heroes I can instantly learn how to counter and play against, while my friends brief me up on their abilities before I read them real quick in lane. But there are times when ever if I'm told exactly what they do and how to counter them, I just cannot. Some heroes seem like they have really short cooldowns on abilities/ults that should have longer abilities, items that they get to upgrade their ult, etc, all that. It just seems unfair sometimes.   But I know, I'm not one to talk when I just started playing the game, everything is probably there for a reason &amp; things cannot be 100% balanced but everything that I may think or claim is unbalanced or OP might just be normal when all this new knowledge is slapping my face.  I'll get used to it, eventually, I just hope I don't ♥♥♥♥ off a lot of teammates on the way.  I don't feed, I try my best not to, I usually don't end up with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ K/D ratio (except for the last few games). But this is my love/hate relationship with DotA 2. It's amazing, but it's really difficult. I love it... But I hate it?   Nevertheless, another great approach from Valve.  Zitten",

With the newest release of Monkey King and a plethora of other changes you are sure to spend the next few weeks just praying that you and the others on your team can manage to pick the broken heroes before the other team. This shouldn't be a problem much longer though. Valve is working round the clock releasing medium to large size updates every 45 minutes, surely they will balance the game anytime now.

I don't consider them that much alike other than they have the same basic set up. 5v5, Destroy the other persons main building, lanes, top down heroes that level up, shop system. That's about it.  Why I choose to pick Dota over LoL is pretty simple though. Dota 2, to many peoples beliefs, is much more new player friendly. Not talking about the playerbase but the actual mechanics and set up. There is a good tutorial system that rewards the player with further cosmetics as they progress. The player profile leveling system is purely cosmetic and leveling unlocks more cosmics and gifts. Absolutely NOTHING outside of the match can influence the outcome in it.  LoL has a Glyph, Talent and Power? (Ability) systems that are limited as a new player. You don't have any glyphs at one, you have few talent points to spend at one, you have a limited number of Powers to pick at one. All of these have an affect on the match you are going to play before you play it. That makes it more of a grind to have these glyphs, and have these talents and have all the powers available to feel like you can really play competitively or on an even edge. And while rank is locked to max level, assuring you that it is fairly even, a new player won't get this experience.  When I go into a match with Dota 2, the only thing I know holding me back is personal experience. Which is just built up over time. I pick any hero I want and don't have to grind to unlock one to play or sit through a free hero pool. I get to choose what I like. And if I want to learn how to play em maybe a bit better I can choose an in-game guide that instructs me as I play, what abilities to level up at what levels, and what items to get through the game as well as tooltips on how to effectively use my abilities or items as that hero. This helped me a TON.  I've got only about over 300 hours of Dota 2 as a casual player but I still love it a ton. Unstanding wins and losses is as simple as rewatching your last match as a replay and seeing what went wrong where. Sometimes it's out of your control because of a team mate or a skilled foe. But I've enjoyed every hour I've played and I've slowly mastered how to play 20+ heroes out of the 110+ pool. Though I have at least played almost all the heroes once to get a feel for em.  Gameplay aside, solid sounds and visuals, beautiful graphics, doesn't require a heavy computer to run great. Best of the genre.",

I was taking zinc supplements so I was shooting massive loads and it became something of a sport to me. For anyone interested here is your best strategy. first, you need to find an isolated spot so you don't become a sex offender. I found a short kind of channel area where I saw the pigeons would congregate. Next, you arouse yourself. I was usually content with envisioning the occasional jogging lady coming over and taking a ♥♥♥♥ on my chest and that was enough to fuel the fire but if you're not as sexually charged as me just take some porn on the go. After you're good an horny, you get some bread. My pigeons preferred white bread but healthier birds might have a taste for honey wheat or maybe even multigrain. Fat, unhealthy birds are slower and easier to hit so remember that. Once you are seated on the bench and ready to do the deed, whip your roosevelt out and scatter bread out within a few feet of you. use your judgement based on how far you know you can ♥♥♥. I was a lonely and depraved soul who could hit targets the size of a thimble at distances up to 4 feet. You wait for the pigeons to begin eating and to get comfortable with your presence. At this point, you want to coo gently and talk sensually to them to gain their trust. Now you're finally ready to ♥♥♥ on your bird. This is a tough part because the rapid motion of masturbation is very frightening to the birds, so you have to be subtle. Once you master a technique, you simply wind it up and let it go, aiming depending on your past cumming experiences. I always came high so I would aim for the neck of the bird and catch it right in the face. It's an extremely satisfying and erotic feeling, seeing those birds reel around covered in ♥♥♥ and maybe even transporting it to other places in the city. Either way I haven't done it in years but every now and then I catch myself gazing wistfully at a flock of birds, ♥♥♥♥ throbbing and waiting for them to land close to me.",

In general, the game is incredibly satisfying when you’re ahead. There’s a lot of enjoyment from simply outplaying your opponents and communicating with your team. Unfortunately, the game can become a lot less enjoyable if you’re losing. A (memorable) portion of the playerbase is incredibly toxic, and that shows both in the game and on any forum talking about it. You can be flamed for not doing things properly if you mess up even once in a game - it’s not a common occurrence, but it’s one that you remember for quite awhile.  That flaming tends to happen more when you’re newer to the game, because of its rather steep learning curve. New players often start out doing incredibly terribly, simply because of the sheer number of mechanics there are to learn. There are a lot of tutorials online on how to improve, and once you know the mechanics exist they’re much easier to master. But no matter where you fall on that curve, there’s always new things to learn. Even the best players in the world make mistakes.  Overall, the sheer complexity and variance in the game keep me coming back. It’s a great way to kill some time with friends (or enemies), and it’s a game that I hope to continue enjoying through the 7.00 patch and beyond. ",

            "review_text": "Dota 2 combines the real-time strategy element of traditional top-down perspective, while also incorporating the leveling and itemization system of a role-playing video game. Players are pitted against each other as two distinct factions called the Radiant and the Dire. The Radiant is a faction based at the southwest corner of the map, while the Dire is a faction based at the northeast corner. Players assume the role of one of eighty-five 'heroes' - strategically-powerful units with special skills, who, through combat experience, may progress to a maximum level of twenty-five. The heroes' methods of combat are heavily influenced by their primary property, which can be physical strength, agility, or intelligence. The basic setup of Dota 2 places two strongholds containing critical structures called 'Ancients' at opposing ends of an geographically-balanced map. These bases are connected by three main paths, (referred to as 'lanes'), which are guarded by defensive towers and groups of weaker units commonly referred to as 'creeps' periodically spawned, which traverse their lanes, attacking enemy units and structures upon sight. Players are split into two teams, each consisting of up to five players, to compete as the primary defenders for each Ancient.  The overall objective of each match is to battle through the opposing force's defenses, in order to arrive at and destroy the opponents' Ancient. Because Dota 2 is highly team-oriented, players must coordinate with their teams in order to achieve victory. The towers and stronghold defenses are invulnerable to attacks so long as the towers nearest to the enemy side still stand.",

Teamwork is somewhat non-existent in pub games although sometimes you find players who communicate and cooperate with each other. On the other hand, most of the time you'll find yourself surrounded by strangers who do not even speak English, moreover they act on their own, then blame someone when they die, curse you at their own language, then rage quit. This kinda ruins the fun, as your team will be playing against a more organized team (most of the time). That said, DotA 2 is meant to be played with your friends whom you can communicate and allows you to execute epic plays that will turn around the tide of battle.  DotA 2 is updated regularly with bug fixes, hero nerfs and new features. I think this is what makes you wanna come and play again after 10 straight loses, because most events reward you with great stuff, like in the last Phantom Assassin event, you can get mythical sets and even arcanas for free. There's always room for improvement, even after 10 loses, because every game is different from the other, unless you act the same and do not learn from your mistakes.  If you have the patience, the game will reward you with good stuff, and of course experience to improve yourself ingame.

And unlike, LoL or HoN which require you to use a rotating hero list until you buy your own with real money or accumulate enough in-game currency to purchase a single hero, DOTA 2 immediately gives you access to its entire library of heroes, for free. In LoL as of the date of this post, it would cost $588 to unlock all heroes with real money. (15000RP/$100, total cost heroes 88185 RP. This calculation excludes bundles)   Each character has a unique playstyle and skillset, and doesn't feel like a clone of another character or a cheap rip off. Every character plays a certain role well, and plays it uniquely. Playing well leads to great rewards, and playing poorly has severe consequences.   There are issues with DOTA 2, the biggest being there is a huge learning curve and you are going to start out being bad if you don't have previous DOTA experience. Learning characters skills, what items do, and what you should be doing early mid and late game initially may be overwhelming. However, doing research and practicing eventually pay off as DOTA 2 is truly one of the most challenging and highest skill cap games available. Valve is also implementing (or has implemented) a tutorial, but there is no way the sheer amount of information needed is contained within it. But I'm sure its a great place to start.   Graphics are great. Gameplay is great. Servers seem lag free. Crashes are very rare. ITS FREE!",

            "review_text": "Dota 2, the succussor to the Warcraft III ROC and TFT now maintained by Icefrog and his team.   Several thoughts come to mind when playing this great RTS game, though it is tedious and frustrating to play at times considering the community, the pro's outweigh the con's by so much.  In my honest opinion the reason why I continue to play Dota 2 is not just for glory and all ( Though to be honest maybe it is haha). Dota 2 encompasses more than just the wins and the rewards you receive. To me it represents so much more that people tend to overlook.  The stuff that people forget is that this game is a TEAM-BASED game and as such it requires a team in order to finish the main objective: Destory the main base of operations for the Dire and Radiant.   In this case what keeps me going is the sheer intensity of strategy to wonder:  Should I save my team-mate? Should I go back to base? Where are all the enemies? If I continue this route, will I be ambushed?  Multiple upon multiple things come to mind when you play this game, because not only must you think rationally and at times abstractly you must consider the base of what Dota 2 starts with a well-oiled team.   Many times, I've come across a team in which they either troll, be passive, ignore, rage-quit, disconnect at the start or even intentionally disrupt the team's flow. This was one of my primary reasons why I am hesitant in playing with other players I don't even know.  Although, when I look back on it, I realize it was a foolish feeling because as you continously play Dota you realize ultimately that:  you learn how to cooperate with your teamates you learn how to adjust accordingly to different situations and circumstances You learn how to strategize with your fellow team mates in order to maintain a strong sense of balance that it doesn't cost the game, but work together towards winning the game.  As an Gamer I realized these thoughts later on, which server to fuel my endeavor to contniue to play with other people just for fun and entertainment.   For every kill we would accomplish, a team-mate would congratulate us For evey nearing death scenario we encounter there is a kind soul attempting to save your skin. For every death we become undeterred and serves to only fuel us even more into winning the game.  And for every single action we take we are closer to making ourselves laugh and have fun in the face of this serious and yet entertaining game that individuals continue to play more and more.  Many people would argue that Dota 2 is just too harsh on it's players and all, but aren't other games also harsh?  When have you ever heard of a Call of Duty player not bash or rage quit in there game? When have you ever heard of a League of Legends player also not bash or rage on there teamates? When have you ever heard of any other game in which OTHER PLAYERS bash, rage, or just plain insult the others because they are losing.  Of course there just words, if you fall under you stand once more, if they insult you, you show them how wrong they are.  For all intents and purposes Dota 2 to me is an entertaining game that I would revisit everytime with a friend, stranger, team, or a guild.   The point is don't let those in the community get to your head or heart, because you never know maybe you'll teach them a lesson in humility, pushing all seriousness aside and feeling the enjoyment and excitement when playing an online game in Dota 2.  In hindsight I regret not being a better teacher or teamate to newbies because it is an unforgiving game with a steep learning curve. Considering the all these faults, players can still have an enjoyable experience playing a game in Dota 2.  All it matters on is if your willing to have a heart to play and learn as you go, because the failures you experience will make you stronger and make friends in the community that will help you have a far more enjoyable experience playing with others for fun.  9.5/10",

If you random match you basically get whatever random players on your team that know or don't know how to play together. Which basically lends itself to uneven steamrolls.   So Ranked Matchmaking (Solo).  Playing with other people in your skill bracket....   Completely broken. Players are awarded or penalized points based on if their team wins/loses.   The problem is is that it is random and you can have the best game of your life, while another player completely feeds the other team and YOU lose MMR points.  This places you in a lower bracket. At which point you play with players who are worse and you've got a better chance of losing more MMR, thus being placed even lower.   That might work if you chose who you play with. But THAT is TEAM MMR. And as the name implies that reflects on your TEAM MMR points.   If you are in Solo Matchmaking you have absolutely no control or sway over random players on the other side of the internet. You can beg and plead with them to stop playing badly, but you have no control at all.  Then you get dragged down into worse and worse games and the game starts to completely blow.   Dota2 is becaoming very VERY unfun. I try my best to play well but bad players keep ruing game after game whci hdrags me down more and more.  I haven't had a good even, tense well matched game for a month and at this rate I doubt I will ever again.   Steam roll after steamroll or late game givaways are common in low mmr and it's just getting worse.",

But in ranked games there are no 'All Random mode' and if I pick in ranked all pick someone random, then my enemies will pick snipers, drow rangers and phantom assassins. Wtf?? This situation make me sick.",
