            "review_text": "They really need to add an neutral choice to the recommendation options. On one hand yes this is a very simple game that pretty much plays itself as others have mentioned. Fairly fun for one finger operation. This game is a mobile/touch inspired game but with very good KB+Mouse support. However, when will developers learn that the mobile microtransaction method fails on PC horribly. Mobile microtransaction fares quite differently than 'made for PC' microtransaction games. Which I am now realising why after a month there are so little reviews. On the other hand I will say it is a good little time filler if you are on a work/lunch/recess break (whatever you do) but like most mobile games. I see in it's future, getting very repetitive. However, I am only 30 minutes into this game so. I will update the review when I have accumulated more time. I have also downloaded the game to iOS &amp; Android so I can get more time into the game.",
