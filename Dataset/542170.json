            "review_text": "I gave this a recommend because I like what the creators are doing, but I do not agree with their method of delivery.   It's okay. It's a good app to tour and thats the end of it. Kind of like visiting a museum, only more boring than a real museum. I also found a few bugs and kinks that really made it kind of frustrating. I feel like the app needs to immerse people more in the displays it has around. The collosseum was the coolest part; but thats just because I could warp inside of it and look around.   For example, if the cell exhibit would let me highlight certain parts of the cell, and show how they contribute to the cells functioning (animation would be paramount, but even without). Showing how something works is much more educational than just looking at it and having a relatively boring narrarator explain in a very scientific manner how it works.   Don't take me for a fool, either. I learned a couple of things from this app that I didn't already know.  In my opinion, the devs needs to work on method of delivery. Good app anyways, fun to mess around with then never play again. I am not deleting it because I will check it again in a few months, and I'll update the review if the app impressed me more than it did this time.",
