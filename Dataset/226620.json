            "review_text": "I guess I was expecting more RPG and less Strategy because this game seemed to me to be too difficult to be fun.  It starts out easy, you have to clear single-screen 'dungeons' that are tough but defeatable. By the time I had finished the tutorials (and even some of those I had to cheat and look for solutions on youtube) that was the end of any successful dungeon clearing that I was able to do.  Game in a nutshell is: The playfield is dark except where your character begins. You always begin at level 1 but can choose your race/class and optionally pay some ingame gold for starting equipment (example: a shield that reduces all damage by 2). You are placed on the screen and have to move around uncovering the darkened squares and ultimately defeat the level 10 boss of the dungeon. Sounds fun right?  The only way to heal yourself and your mana (used for skills found as you explore the dungeon) are potions or uncovering darkened dungeon squares. Both are in limited supply.   The 'casual' rating of this game is true in the time required to play sense, but if you don't exploit every single weakness of every enemy, and if you don't kill higher level enemies for the bonus exp (which is harder than it sounds, again, very limited healing) you have no chance of killing the level 10 boss monster.  Because every move counted so much, and because ultimately it takes a lot of moves to clear a dungeon, I found myself getting frustrated at how incapable I found myself of clearing a dungeon. I'd get to level 8 or 9 and simply not be able to kill enough enemies at that point without dying, to get to level 10 or have enough of a stockpile of potions for the final boss of each dungeon.   So, instead of surely dying to the higher level boss, I would exit the dungeon, able to keep whatever gold I found in there and selling off the potions for 50-60 gold, take away 10-15 it costs for the items you bring with you. At that point I was looking at minimum 500 gold upgrades to unlock anything more fun about the game, and I decided to uninstall and give up on the game because there was no other difficulty setting.  If that kinda game sounds fun more power to you but I was looking for a much more casual game, as in not an intense experience. I wanted to shut my brain off for a bit but this took all of my concentration and was, for me, not a fun game to play in hindsight.",

You enter a one-screen (sometimes with a basement) dungoen with one or more bosses hiding in it. Your objective is to kill all the bosses. However, you will have to level up your character enough in order to be able to stand a chance against the boss. You do this by defeating lesser enemies in a logical order, using your class and racial abilities. Enemies don't move, so you have plenty of freedom to think out your moves. Strangely enough, you gain HP and mana by exploring the dark areas of the screen, so you'll have to manage this resource carefully.  Overall, this game fits the bill for those who like puzzles, but also enjoy random elements and roguelikes or rpgs. Don't expect an exploration-based experience, though.",

Everyone keeps going on about how awesome this game is, I like it too, but it's not what' you would normally expect froma dungeon crawler, please let me explain.... forewarned is forearmed....   1st, This is not really a dungeon-crawler... it's a PUZZLE GAME It uses a lot of maths type puzzles - you need to figure out how many minions to kill so that you can level up, and how to do it efficiently... killing higher level baddies gains you an exp bonus, but you need to do it as much as possible so you don't lose XP from minions that are now 'lower'... you need to snowball your XP. Levelling up gives you 100%health and mana, and you have to exploit this all game so that you don't use too many potions.... you'll need them for the boss in the level.  2nd, because it's only 10 minutes, things have to be simplified. You move around on a checkerboard style tabletop. revealing a tile (standing next to it = gaining visibility of the next tile) will restore some health and mana.  3rd, this is not a 10 minute game. You can play a dungeon in 10 minutes, sure, so you can play in 10 minute sessions, this can be a positive... but 'just one more, it's only 10 minutes' will quickly translate into hours of game play.  4th This is a Rogue LITE - it does have a progression system where you can unlock new classes, abilities, etc between runs, in a similar way to Rogue Legacy. [A true rogue-like features permadeath where you lose everything and start again at level 1.]  For those that like this game, it's addictive. Look at people's play times, the ones that have reviewed this. there are some who have 15-30h, then there are those with 80-120 hours, and the odd one over 200h - that's about the point where you beat the game, from my understanding / reading on the wiki.  Do I recommend this game? That's such a hard one. Yes, If you know what you're getting into when you buy it, but the Store description is deceptive, and doesn't really explain just how this game works, and I was dissapointed about that, I wanted more 'hack n slash', and less 'calculating the next 7 steps to level up without using that mana pot' So for me, Although the game itself seems solid, I do like it, and I will play it some more, but I already know I won't clock it if it requires 200h it's a No.    ",

Pros: + solid tutorial + fun and funny mini-questing/story line + good aesthetics + varied soundtrack with good music + kingdom upgrade system adds meaning/progression + challenging + procedural generation = big replay value + high satisfaction level when solving troublesome dungeons + tons of gameplay/replay value + great value on sale, good value for most at full price + unique  Cons (not many so I am grasping at straws) - Not as casual of a game as advertised (you need a strong knowledge of the interactions between abilities/effects/statuses etc.) - Could have high frustration level for some - Perhaps too much puzzle and not enough dungeon crawler - Aesthetics may be confused with graphics making it undesirable tosome (yes, this game has bad graphics, but good aesthetics)  I’d definitely recommend it if you like to think, strategize, and take your time to make a move in games. Great for people on the go, but perhaps I’m a bit slow/dumb, because the puzzles take me longer than 15 mins usually. ",

The Good:  -The necessity to use different strategies and builds depending on the levels. There's no single strategy that will beat the game for you. -The difficulty is almost spot-on throughout the entire game. It's only easy in the beginning. By the end it's brutally hard, but you feel accomplished. -Fun in small spurts or for long periods of time. -There are a ton of upgrades that keep the game fresh.  The Bad: -The more you lose on one level the harder it is to remain patient and play well (more of a personal flaw, but it applies greatly here). -The randomness of the 'boss', glyph drops, enemies, etc. can break/ruin a run for you. Takes some luck on harder levels.  Verdict: If you can deal with feeling dumb as you try to figure out the best strategies and are patient enough to not blow a fuse as you repeat levels multiple times, the game is great. The upgrades keep the game and strategies fresh and you feel great accomplishment as you make your way through the harder levels. For the price they are asking, you get great value for your buck. I'd give it a solid 9/10.",

This is a not a game for casual playing; while it does not require quick reflexes to win, it instead falls back on good ol' strategic thinking. Desktop Dungeons is unique in most ways, all of them good, and I highly reccommend any players who enjoy using their brain in many, many, many RPG combat situations.",

Desktop Dungeons is an interesting little roguelike in which everything is a carefully managed resource. Gold, inventory, enemies, even unexplored dungeon areas must be handled in a delicate balance as one progresses towards the boss. You will die uncountable times in your quest to learn the nuances of dungeon exploring, but the wit and fun of the game take the edge off the many failed attempts.  With 112 different race/class combinations, every randomly generated dungeon brings a new experience for any play style. The dungeons are small enough that a run can take as little as 10 minutes, excellent for the casual gamer who doesn't have hours to spend at the computer.",

            "review_text": "Desktop Dungeons is an interesting game and worth looking into, but it's not quite the 'roguelike-lite' that it advertises itself to be. Each dungeon is one level (occasionally with a sublevel with more treasure or more enemies) and your adventurer always starts fresh at level 1 at the beginning of the dungeon, so there's no characters that carry over from dungeon to dungeon. The most notable difference between this game and other roguelikes is that monsters in dungeons do not move and do not attack until you attack, which causes the game to become more of a puzzle game than a genuine roguelike- the challenge comes not from the monsters themselves but rather budgeting your resources and defeating the monsters in the correct way to give your hero as much power as they need to defeat the boss monster and defeat the dungeon.  That's not saying Desktop Dungeons isn't entertaining or worth looking into, though. As far as being a sort of time-waster to play inbetween ordering a pizza or during a break at work or something, it fits perfectly since each dungeon could take at most 15 or 20 minutes to complete. The gameplay suits itself well to playing in short bursts rather than sitting down for long sessions and as such is a perfect fit for the busy gamer looking for a more intricate experience over Bejeweled or games on Facebook or something.  That being said, I'm not entirely sure this game is worth the $15 price tag. Maybe wait for it to come on sale for $10 or less, then go ahead and make the dive.  One final note: The soundtrack, made by Grant Kirkhope (Banjo-Kazooie, Goldeneye, Perfect Dark) and Danny Baranowsky (Binding of Isaac, Super Meat Boy) is excellent and fits the game well. Makes the dungeon-crawling a lot more thematic and interesting than it would have been otherwise.",

If you are balking at 12 quid for it when there is a free version do not worry. The paid version has so much more content than the free version (city building etc) and is much more refined and well balanced. The years of refinement really do show when comparing the two versions.   One of the best and unique indie games around. A must buy.  10/10",

The learning curve is deceptively shallow until you pass the Easy dungeon. Then, it gets steep quickly. I haven't decided if the problem is the procedurally generated levels (meaning you can't figure out the right path and then execute it properly on the second run, if you didn't manage it the first time), or if the problem is the tricks you can use to beat things beyond your normal abilities (an expectation that once you've encountered an ability, you'll be able to put it in practice like a seasoned rules lawyer). Either way, the Normal dungeons are all too difficult for me, even after several runs at trying to solve them. The result, however, is this: far from being a fun and quirky game you can use to fill ten minutes for a break from your work, it becomes a frustrating problem that has players spending much longer than intended trying to beat a dungeon, any dungeon, before giving up in furstration. Great idea, lousy execution.",
