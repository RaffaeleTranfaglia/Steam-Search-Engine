            "review_text": "The Baconing is a sequel to DeathSpank. It's a cartoony, colorful action adventure game with gruesome humor. Fart jokes agogo as Deathspank fights an army of undead cyborgs to destroy some sacred thongs.   It's absurd, it's ridiculous. It's also colorful and fun and reminds me of some fo the more twisted cartoons of my youth like Ren and Stimpy, Invader Zim and The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy.   The Baconing is a pretty simple game at its core, but has more complex equipment and item systems than what I was expecting. On the one hand it's kind of a button masher, but some fo the mechanics are overly complex for such a game.   It might be your thing if you like hack and slash adventures with sophmoric toilet humor, but it just didn't do it for me.",

            "review_text": "I can't recommend this one. The story is ok in an over-the-top ridiculous kind of way, some of it is sort of funny. The RPG elements are super light, the loot system is very shallow to the point that you can essentially ignore it. After the first zone you realize that each zone is going to follow the same exact formula. Some quests have you running back through areas you already cleared, which at times can seem like an annoying way to extend the hours the game has to offer.   The worst part about this game is that the combat is extremely clumsy feeling. You must be quick and have timing down with your shield bash to win in the encounters, but the inputs feel laggy and you often miss the enemies for no good reason. Its the main part of the game, and it is implemented badly. This makes the game pretty challenging at times. Challenging is fine, but challenging because the controls are bad is not.   Overall, everything feels rushed. I had heard good things about this series, but this is not the one to get into.",

            "review_text": "Excellent dialog, story, and charming graphics make up for what can only be described as mediocre mechanics, it's a hack and slash that will frustrate the hell out of you with collection quests and side missions that add little to the overall game and serve only as a comedy tool. The co-op feature is not much to write home about, with a number of sidekicks available with a sort of reduced functionality, no gearing for sidekicks limits this a bit and minimizes loot fights. The game itself is rescued by its pacing and story and on the whole I would recommend it at a lower than usual price. not worth the £10 tag it puts forward.",

However, this game works a bit different from the other DeathSpank titles because of their blocking system - expect to die a lot, especially in the beginning.",

I haven't played the previous 2 installments of DeathSpank, but I've read The Baconing is very similar to those. So take that into account.  Good, entertaining game. ",
