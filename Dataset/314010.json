            "review_text": "Boid is an RTS, a single cell RTS where your goal is not only to reproduce your creatures via spawners, but to mutate them into different combat forms to fill a variety of strategic roles. Multiplayer and bot matches are free, but single player is a DLC. I feel like this model works to get people to try the game and jumpstart the community without having to drop a monetary commitment. I think Boid is pretty neat and I would recommend it to a variety of fans including RTS, strategy, multiplayer, mobile and a long list of others. If anything I have said sounds interesting give Boid a try.",

            "review_text": "Online multiplayer and skirmish games are both free; purchasing the game grants access to the fairly standard campaign mode. There is a map editor, but no randomized maps (there are plenty of maps included, though). The interface could be improved: tool-tips appear entirely too slowly, counters are not indicated on the aforementioned tool-tips, the minimap is useless, and you can’t zoom in or out. Units are unique in appearance, although they fall into general categories (fast, ranged, healer). There are hard counters in the game for the basic units (guns beat crabs beat scouts beat guns) and turrets that can be captured to freeze, fight, or revert enemy units to their basic form. Units auto-attack while moving, but do not move as a group, resulting in a lot of micromanagement. Difficulty in managing units is compounded by the fast pace of the game; typically, one wrong move (such as losing a large battle, or losing units to a neutral location) is enough to do you in, as the AI is adept at the mechanics. While the campaign isn’t really worth the cost, those who can handle simplified, fast-paced real-time strategy games have nothing to lose in downloading the free skirmish and multiplayer modes.

There are zones which create units, units can be mutated into a variety of more specialized units, usually fast ones, tanky ones, ranged units, explosive units, sometimes poisonous units and medics... ocasionally you also get a super-ranged-reincarnating-explosive-giant-squid. There are also a couple of powers which can be casted locally.  Multiplayer is free, and works flawlessly, the game has pleasing graphics, fair/good music and no apparent bugs.  Must try for every anxious RTS lover, its simplicity makes it a very good casual game kind of like playing speed chess.",

Nothing like being new just to get reamed by players with thousands of games under their belts. I like it but not enough to be some other player’s punching bag on a regular basis. If you like queuing against the same high level player game after game to get your ♥♥♥ kicked this game is for you.   This game has about 10,000 registered users according to its ranking lists. Over 8,000 of these users are the lowest rank. Why? Refer to my punching bag remark above. The bottom line is that this would be a fantastic game if match making were more refined. New players shouldn’t be going up against players in the highest tiers of the game with thousands of games to their name. It’s because new members get their ♥♥♥ kicked repeatedly upon first trying the game that they get turned off by it. ",
