            "review_text": "'Do you recommend this game?', Steam asks me and for once I honestly don't know which button to choose. I like Eidolon, I really do. But I'm not able to play it anymore, after just a couple of hours. I have nothing against walking simulators. But this... this is pushing the idea to the limit. The area is vast. Any kind of map is hard to come by and it's mostly just fragmentary and vague. The only kind of hint can show you only what direction to go in order to get another random piece of narration. With no word as to whether it will take you one minute or one hour to get there, it's not really all that helpful in the long run.   On to the positives: the story is interesting and told in a way that suits the idea behind this game. Together with the overall feeling of the game it puts the player in a very specific mood. You really feel lonely in this empty, strange-yet-familiar world as you try to discover its past. This atmosphere is the best thing that Eidolon has to offer. Visuals are a matter of taste - it's clear that not a lot of priority was put on them in the development process. If solid color polygons are something you can't stand, it's not for you. There are moments, however, when the game is simply beautiful. The night sky with its myriads of stars is quite stunning and effects such as fog or sunset/sunrise light work wonders even with such simple graphics. The soundtrack is pretty, but it gets repetitive after a while. Oh, and the game has some sort of survival system. It's very simple and easy, but at least it makes up for some slight alteration from the usual 'walk, walk more, and then walk yet some more' routine.   Even with all its flaws, I enjoyed this game when I still had the patience for it. It's peaceful and works well with the right attitude - I would strongly recommend to play it at night, with nothing to distract and enough time not to hurry anywhere. That being said, I usually like this kind of games but couldn't get very far in this one. I've just had enough after some time. So in the end, do I recommend it? I clicked 'Yes'. But only, ONLY if you know what you're getting yourself into and are okay with it. It's a very specific game for very specific kind of gamers.",

I just finished 'The Old City: Leviathan' and LOVED it so I figured I would try another of my many walking sims. I thought Eidolon might be similar to 'Proteus' (short but excellent game) due to a similar art style. Unfortunately, it is not. I just spent (wasted) several hours 'playing' Eidolon and got NOTHING from the experience other than the ability to collect mushrooms, blackberries and wood. It is boring, repetitive and pointless -- the map is hard to decipher and it doesn't show where you are -- useless. This game is neither fun nor interesting. Not worth a buy at any price.",

The story is interesting, and I'm only a few hours (real time) into it so I doubt I've even touched the surface of content.   Graphically it is minimalist, and I would like to see it be a bit better. It doesn't need to be next gen graphical design, but at least a bit better to aid in the imersion aspect.   One thing it doesn't have which I would very much like to see is a keybinding allowing me to look around while I'm walking. At the moment if you want to look around while walking you have to turn your entire body.  Given the caveat I have only been playing a short time, I would also like to see a bit more interaction with my environment. Being able to manipulate objects and perhaps even being able to build rudimentary shelters such as lean-tos to further the survival aspect of the game would be awesome.   Even with my 3 suggestions above, it is still a great game if you just want to relax and go fishing, hunting, camping, or exploring.",

On the second try I froze to death within minutes. Third and most recent attempt: starvation. In the time i've played this game, I haven't come across a single note, transcript, tool or other noteworthy item despite doing my best to look for them,   The closest I ever got to finding something interesting was just recently when I saw something that looked like rows of little cottages along a swampy lakeside. I had emerged from the forest at the wrong side of the lake and so I had to get around it. After several attempts and a few in-game days later, I reached the cottages. To my great dissappointment, they turned out to be trees with oddly shaped foliage. I remembered that one of the 'cottages' was located a bit further away from the rest and had a bit of a different shape, so I decided to check that out for the hell of it. At this point however, I was fatigued. cold and hungry, so I decided to rest for a bit. When I woke up a thick mist had crept in, covering the entire lake and the surrounding area. I tried to make my way to the cottage-shaped piece of mystery through the mist, but then I starved to death.   Frankly I really want to like this game, but it´s just too unforgiving for me to enjoy. Be prepared to sink some time into this if you want the most out of it. I will give credit where it's due though; the soundtrack is pretty good, even great in some cases, but it triggers far too rarely to compensate.  -EDIT-  Just now I gave this game one last, serious chance. I summoned every bit of patience I could muster, and set out to explore the world. having already tried going in multiple different directions, I decided to try venturing past the giant, snow-clad mountains, hoping to find something beyond. I gathered mushrooms and tinder for days, planned my route to the best of my ability and set off.  After travelling for what felt like an eternity, barely avoiding freezing to death by building campfires along my path, I finally passed the mountains. For the first time in a long time, I was actually excited to see what lied beyond the misty veil that greeted me.  Then i fell off the end of the world and got dumped back where I started.   And then I uninstalled.  Also, someone said this game has stories on notes in it, but I never found any. Supposedly there are tools too, but I never found any of those either.",

            "review_text": "[Copying over a review I made on my tumblr because I am lazy.]  This is a very interesting game. If you’re a fan of massive worlds with basic survival needs, but you aren’t much into digging or building, and have an eye out for a story, this might be a game for you.   Eidolon plops you into a post-apocalyptic western Washington. You have no goal, no purpose. The world is immense and beautiful and it becomes what you make of it.    There are documents from the past littered around the world. If you so choose you may search for these documents (as you find them, you can request a light to shoot up into the sky to guide your way toward finding more), or you can simply explore the landscape, creating your own goals. Reach the top of that mountain, see what’s on the other side of that lake, follow this river, explore these ruins of a once-great city.  As stated the game is set in a post-apocalyptic world. I’ve yet to find out exactly what happened, personally, but apparently things started some time around the 2070’s, when a massive earthquake destroyed Seattle. More than that, I am unsure. I did find some documents in Bellevue pertaining to some fanatical cultist. I’m unsure what to make them as of yet. The story really draws me in and I’m excited to continue exploring the world and discovering more of it.   Eidolon has a very slow pace. Your first goal is survival before you can do anything else. There are berries and mushrooms to sustain you, but you can also fish or hunt if you choose to do so. Watch out for bears and wolf-like creatures that will attack you on sight. If you get wounded it may fester, causing illness and increase your need for food and sleep. There is some way to treat wounds and festered wounds but I’ve yet to discover it. I ended up looking at a guide and apparently there are bee hives you can shoot down from trees. The honey you collect is what has the antibacterial properties to treat those wounds.   The simplistic art style lends its way beautifully to the size of the world. The only downside is the lack of a physical sun or moon in the sky, but all other aspects of the colors changing makes the passage of time as smooth as possible. Perhaps the lack of the celestial entities is what truly drives the powerful movement of time. The world is simultaneously beautiful and simple, such that exploration is hardly boring, but you can also turn your focus to collecting documents for the story without missing much by ignoring the scenery.   I’ve only spent a few hours with the game overall so far. Spend an hour and you’ll accomplish very much and very little at the same time. You can find the game on Steam, but it’s also available for purchase from the developer’s blog. Buying off their blog brings you through Humble which grants you access to both a Steam Key and a download for a DRM-free version of the game. It also helps support Ice Water Games a bit more. I look forward to more games from this team!",

Trees and plants to observe? They are too lacking in detail to be very interesting to look at. Wild animals? They are more likely to be stuck running in place than flashes of shy wildlife. But the landscapes? I expected them to be visually beautiful. I was disappointed.  The stories? Hit and miss. Some are definitely intriguing, some are mundane.  Survival resources? A simple chore. I like how the food deteriorates so you have to keep gathering. Survival tools? They feel out of place. Navigating? Not for the faint of heart! You will still get halfway lost after planning your path carefully.  Yes, I still recommend it.  The game is found in how it blends together. The ponderous pace, the passing titanic trees, the conscientious pauses to plan your eventual destination, the forced attention to what lies beside and ahead, the beckoning twinklings of a lost epoch... it is a long quiet desolate trek. It feels like lying in the grass for hours and staring at the flickering leaves. The desolate wilderness was an experience in patience, serenity, and meditation. I enjoyed many hours of this muted melody.   Except for how my game ended. I didn't know you could hurt yourself descending slopes. I found myself rudely informed when both of my legs broke. I crawled, nauseous, to a constant food source. There I lay, passing out every 45 seconds, until it became clear that I was not going to get better.  Ever.  I didn't even have a single hint for what to search for let alone where to search. I couldn't try to find an answer in my condition.  So I looked up what to do in response to this calamity. Honey. ???? In some distant forest maybe. ????? I tried to drag myself to the specific type of forest, but failed to find it after crossing half the map. The only solution? (Serene)Ragequit. I never worked up enough desire to go back to Eidolon again.  Yes, I still recommend it. It didn't mean I didn't like the time I had. Eidolons. Eidolons.   Related games to try: Viridi. Waking Mars.
