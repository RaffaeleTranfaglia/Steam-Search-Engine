The cut scenes were well done, even though at this point they are dated, they still draw you in. I think the only real flaw in the game is that sometimes you are left with no immediate purpose, and you wander from place to place until you find what you need to trigger the next step in the game. This is something that is present in most of the older point and click adventures, so I try not to let it keep me from enjoying the rest of the game.",

            "review_text": "After the disappointment of Post Mortem I was relieved to find this game is as great as I had been led to believe.   In comparison to Post Mortem, this game still has a hard coded 4:3 aspect screen resolution but crucially it does not crash all the time when the game loses focus. The horrible first person camera is gone. The annoying branching dialogue that could result in you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ off a character so you miss out on crucial information has been replaced with a much simpler system. The interface is generally much better all round. There are no randomly appearing items in this game which makes things more satisfying as instead of back tracking across every location you can just remember where you saw a suitable item.  The story in this game is excellent, it really engaged me and kept me wanting to play on. The split between the two interconnected murder investigations was very well done.The puzzles are also very good, they are all very logical and don’t feel arbitrary. Most of them are quite simple but the more challenging ones take a bit of thinking about but are very satisfying.  I did encounter one bug though. The mouth movements didn’t work properly, the characters either kept their mouths closed or they rapidly flickered open and closed. This is only a very minor thing and in no way detracts from this excellent point and click adventure. I don’t think you are going to miss out on anything significant if you entirely skip Post Mortem and just start with this game.",

Especially when you have like gazillion permutations for right cooking recipe and each animations takes eternity. Oh joy when you fail. Also, I spent like 3h of gameplay solely solving the lockpicking puzzle: greatest time of my life. And that robot puzzle was also diamond, because it didn't indicate explicitly where's the goal (also because background graphics are so basic Microids: grey, dull and gray).",

Still Life is a point-and-click adventure genre game; thus, a game more favorable to those who have ample patience for a slower paced game with a good amount of searching, exploring, and figuring out what to do next.   Still Life also includes puzzles mixed within the game, with some being very difficult to solve. Most people will need a walkthrough to solve the harder puzzles.   The graphics are not great, only having about average quality. Voice acting and dialogue range from fair to poor.   Score: 7 out of 10",

There are a lot of locations involved and the level design is amazing. As regards to the story, this is a well-thought game. There aren't a lot of plot twists and the resolution of the story might seem a little unsatisfying for some, but the overall plot has a lot of strong points. What I liked the most out of this topic is the interwined stories of Victoria and his grandfather, and how everything is not as black and white as one might think. The puzzles are very good, but at times a little cryptic, just like some parts of the game where you are left wondering what to do next. But, despite the minor flaws, Still life is a very exciting adventure and it has a lot to offer to people that enjoy a good story and well developed characters.",

Story line excellent and the puzzles although difficult in some cases are all solvable with the evidence given. Nice switch of characters between chapter 1 and 2 looking forward to completing and trying number two. 9/10   Now having to change my review as now come across a stupid puzzle that requires you to navigate a robot through a virtually invisible laser field. Totaly stupid and no way to bypass.  Destroyed about a thousand robots and still no luck.  A good adventure/puzzle game ruined by a stupid eye hand co-ordination puzzle.  5/10",

I made it to just past the opening credits when the first character the protagonist comes in contact with is an American black police officer. It appears that those responsible for the translation are only familiar with American black people through 19th century minstrel shows. As I can only find one review that discusses this atrocious characterization, and they only refer to it as 'borderline racist,' I feel some responsibility to inform the Steam community (a community that I consider mostly comprised of responsible and open-minded game consumers) to think twice before purchasing something so offensive. This racism is not borderline, it's outright and unacceptable.",

I ended up playing it more as an interactive novel, using a guide to cheat my way through it, and that was an enjoyable experience for me - one I'd recommend to others.",
