            "review_text": "Year Walk is a game that I first purchased about a month after it's release here on Steam, over two years ago. I mainly just wanted a quick horror fix, and what I got was a lot more. This game focuses on the very obscure ancient Swedish tradition of Årsgång, or Year Walking. After playing this game, I was awestruck by not only the way the story was presented, but also by the amazing visuals, and how even though there was certainly horror elements in the game, I felt completely comfortable.   Upon completing this game, I felt like I needed to know more about this tradition that was Årsgång. This feeling sent me on a two year journey through Swedish sources and 20 year old dead internet forums that helped me conclude a whole blog and thesis on this subject. Never has a game compelled me so strongly to find out more, and to know all I can possibly know, and in April of this year, I had done it. I had found out all there was to know about this once obscure tradition that now found itself as common knowledge.  This is why I am asking everybody who could be reading this to BUY THIS GAME. You will be intrigued, terrified, curious, excited, mystified, and much more over this 2 or so hour journey, maybe three if you read the excellent encyclopedia. I've played this game 5 times now at different speeds and settings, just to make sure I found every little thing in this game. Now that I have, I must say it was completely worth it, and I'm sure I'll be going back to it again soon. Some people may find this game boring, and I understand that, it's not necessarily for everybody out there, but please just try it. This game is $6.00 (£4.10), when it should easily go for twice that price. if I had to give this game some sort of overall rating, it must be a 10/10. I feel ridiculous giving a rating out to a game that has changed the way I see things so much but I feel it's justified. Just play it.",

The game mechanics are simple and the puzzles are challenging but not irritatingly so.  Where this game really shines is the incredible atmosphere. Few games that I have played have really drawn me into their world the way that this one has. The scenery and the music work together in a way that make you truly feel the game as you play it. I honestly felt that I was wandering through a supernatural forest seeking answers to questions that only the spirits knew. Don't even get me started on how eerily creepy the game was, especially since when I first started playing I hadn't been aware that it was a horror game. Your second time through the game only adds to this as you learn A LOT about the events of the game through a second individual's eyes.   If you're looking for an atmospheric, creepy puzzle game with a deep storyline, look no further. Year Walk is worth a playthrough!",

            "review_text": "Year Walk is definitely an interesting game, maybe less so 'game' but huge emphasis on interesting. I would call this a visual story (not to be confused with a visual novel) and while most games are obviously 'visual stories', I'll try to give a reason as to why I call it that. I'll start with the gameplay as that will help me get my point across.   Your character (never given a name) is put into this beautiful snowy landscape. The only movements you can make are to walk left and right, or forwards and backwards on paths. You have a cursor so you can click on objects here and there, but there aren't a ton of things to interact with. Hence, why I say this is more of a visual story. While you do have control, I feel more like you're just watching through their eyes.  Onto the gameplay/setting. The term 'Year Walk' (Årsgång) refers to a Swedish ritual that was believed to be done by people from the medieval times to the 19th century. The Year Walk was done on either Christmas Eve, or New Years. The idea is that you lock yourself in your house, void of light, no eating, drinking, or interacting with others. After which of 24 hours, the year walker is tasked with heading to their church in order to have a vision of the coming years future. There, they will have to pass the tests of supernatural creatures in order to be granted that vision.  The premise alone is very intriguing, and I knew nothing of it while diving into this game. Let me say this, I played through Year Walk in one sitting. Now, it only took me about 2.5 hours, but that time alone was very gripping and I couldn't wait to progress further along. The atmoshpere of the game is mind blowing. Play this with headphones on and in a dark room for full immersion. The game is also genuinely terrifying through it's use of the lore. Added that the soundtrack beautiful and the art is amazingly well put together, you've crafted a very serene yet eerie world that can totally draw you in and make you lose sight of things.  While I would love to tell you much more about this game, I really need to leave it up to you to discover what it holds. It's not terribly hard, puzzle wise, but there are some here and there. Also, in game, if you'd like to read up more, they provide an encyclopedia that provides some descriptions of what you'll encounter. I've also heard you need to play it more than once to really get the full picture. So, I hope you will play this as I highly recommend it. It's something that will stay with you long after it's over.  P.S. Don't worry about the box. Yet.",

            "review_text": "Year Walk is one of the most interesting and unique experiences I have had in gaming for a very long time. It's a first person adventure horror game based around the little known Swedish folklore of the 'year walk', a ritual where individuals go without food and drink all day and then wander the woods at midnight, hoping to gain visions of the future but also potentially encountering dangerous supernatural beings. As such, the setting and story are fantastic and really draw you into the game. The great soundtrack, creepy sound effects, and unique visual style that looks like a mix between a pop-up book and a silent film help to enhance the setting even further and make this game a very emotional experience. While playing Year Walk, I truly felt the sensation of being all alone in a dark forest. In this way, the game was simultaneously comforting and terrifying in a way that I can't quite explain. Another enjoyable aspect of the game is that it essentially drops you into an open world and leaves you to explore and solve puzzles on your own, much like Myst or The Witness.  Overall, I highly recommend Year Walk. It's an experience not easily forgotten and best played on a dark snowy evening with a good set of headphones.",

While starkly simple, YW capitvates its player with a completley unique sountrack and quite obscure historical and mythical items. I can't possibly explain the story line, but the premise is that you, in your crazy swede mindset, decided to follow the traditional avenue of the 'Year Walk'; a ceremony of sorts where the person in question isolates themself for a whole day in a dark house without food, water or exposure to anything whatsoever, then ventures into the remote woods at nightfall to encounter beasts, magic and possibly see the future.  Before you ask, yes, this was a real thing that people did. I'm proud to be swedish, but good grief are my people wierd.

Like a book, once you've read it, you're done with it.  The only pluses that Year Walk has are that it's relatively cheap and that the story is interesting.

I just wandered around, figured out the map, viewed the encyclopedia. Most people have said that there are just a few times that things jump out at you or are horrifying. So far almost everything after that first 5 minutes happening in the game is VERY scary/horror to me... not just eerie/creepy. It isn't just a few times. All I've seen/heard are    screaming, scary images, bloody scenery, and dead babies.    There should be more emphasis on the horror aspect in the video and description.

Inspired by the Swedish folk tradition of Arsgang, Year Walk sets you in the shoes of someone who dares to undertake this strange journey.  The art and simple controls, as well as the sensation that you are watching an old film complete with tears and dust on the print, put you into a realm where anything could happen. It is not without some quality jump scares and unsettling imagery. There is a bit of Lovecraftian horror dwelling within Year Walk.  The puzzles fit into the world well, although while manipulating them you can tell the game was conceived for tablets. It should not diminish any enjoyment, however. They are clever enough to make the player feel smart upon completing them.   And the less you know going into it, all the better. Year Walk is worth it for fans of interactive fiction games and creepy short stories.",

The dark, supernatural atmosphere is fully immersive, with haunting music and sound effects, a creepy unlockable journal, traditional Scandinavian monsters, and a few jump scares that add to the surreal horror. A warning, though: If you are at all squeamish about blood or death, you will have a hard time playing this.   The artwork is reminiscent of hand-cut paper collages, further enhancing the traditional folk feeling of the game.  As far as gameplay goes, it mainly involves circling through a layered snowy landscape in search of puzzles and clues. As you advance the plot, new paths open up and new interactables appear. The key is figuring out which puzzles you can solve right away, and which you will need to come back to later after you have more information. Backtracking is a key component of the game, but the map is small enough that it never feels like a slog.  The built-in hint system is useful in guiding you through the main plot if you are stuck. It contains a progressive series of hints for each chapter, with the first hint being an extremely vague nudge in the right direction, and the last hint being a blatant spoiler. Players can control which hints are revealed and which remain hidden, so you only ever get as much information as you need.  Something I didn't realize on my first playthrough: Some puzzles require keyboard interaction, some puzzles require the mouse, some require a combination of keyboard and mouse. If you are stuck, it might be because you didn't realize you could click and drag an object to move it, or click and hold an item to carry it.  Some of the achievements are tricky to get, but between the game itself and the achievement descriptions, you should eventually be able to figure them all out.   While this game will likely leave you feeling depressed due to its tragic thematic elements, it is still an amazing little gem, and I would give it an overall rating of 9/10.",

            "review_text": "Year Walk is a beautiful, unique experience, and despite its length, it is well worth the price. While this is considered a horror game, its primary draw is its clever puzzles and deceptively quaint and calming atmosphere that seem to take some inspiration from Tim Burton films. The sound design is excellent; both the music and sound effects are extremely crisp and know exactly when to go all out and when to draw back. There are even some music-based puzzles that will rely on your sense of pitch to be able to solve. However, most of the game is very quiet, with little to no music in many sections (though what music is there is quite well done), and only the eerily realistic sound of footsteps crruching in the thick snow will accompany you.  One of the key selling points of the game is its focus on Swedish folklore, which is told through a companion app (included in the Steam version) and, while it is not necessary to read, I highly recommend going through it so you will know about the different creatures you will encounter on your journey. I found myself fascinated with the folklore itself, and some of the legends are truly frightening. However, the horror elements are mostly intermittent and not exceptionally scary (most of the 'scary' parts I would classify more as unnerving than outright terrifying), I think this game is perfect for anyone who is new to horror games and will do a good job easing you into the genre.  However, despite my glowing recommendation, I would not recommend playing it on PC if you can get it for another device. This game was originally developed to be played on mobile devices, and while the cursor is perfectly functional, it feels a bit clunky and does not have the same seamless feel of dragging across the screen as using your finger. I would say the ideal version of the game would be the Wii U version, as it has the touch controls of the mobile version, the convenince of having the companion act on the GamePad, and is presented on a large TV to let you truly soak in the visuals. However, if you don't want to play on mobile and/or don't have a Wii U, you experience will not be significantly hampered if you choose to play it on PC. Highly recommend,",

Every time an elaborate animation begins, you're forced to stare at it at the dev's intended angle. One particularly irritating example is when a character who you have to follow performs their walking-forward-animation, and you're prevented from moving while the camera points straight at the spectacle, temporarily rendering you unable to continue following the character. Very jarring and annoying.  But apart from that, Year Walk is delightful. Buy it. Don't you dare use a walkthrough.",

The visuals are identical, it's a few bucks cheaper, and the controls are arguably better when actually using your fingers to swipe across the environment.  As for the game itself, it's a stellar game. For such a short runtime, Year Walk shows an interesting world and builds a genuinely fascinating and creepy atmosphere. The visuals are absolutely gorgeous and really compliment that atmosphere. The story is also really clever and doesn't overstay it's welcome. Much like the original Portal, it's short, sweet, and gets it's point across with no distractions. All killer, no filler.  Absolutely pick this game up if it looks up your alley. Again, I'd urge you to try the iOS version first if you have that option available to you. If not, the PC release is absolutely fine, with only sometimes fiddly controls and a few surprises neutered in the process. I highly recommend Year Walk.",

The encyclopedia tells some interesting tales which will help make your Year Walk easier and on top of that, you have access to hints to point you in the right direction. The first time you finish the game, it isn't exactly over yet. You are given a clue to discover a secret, which will lead to a lot more information and the actual end of the game. The achievements are small puzzles themselves, as you don't get them for simply completing the Year Walk; you need to do things in a certain order, not use hints, etc. It's definitely worth another walk to get these done and it won't take long if you paid attention and/or took notes during your first walk.",

I love the attention to detail - the soft crunch of snow with each step you take and the complete isolation of the wintery woods. The blending of mythos and mystery is carefully considered. It's a shorter game, but I didn't find it lacking or feel like the price was unreasonable. It's as much of an artful experience as it is a game.",

            "review_text": "This is my review of Year Walk.  Well, what a game that was. Or maybe it shouldn't be called a game. Instead, an experience in solitude. I had owned this game for over a year before finally playing it, and I can't lie, I’m kind of annoyed I waited that long. Me and My Associate decided to go through all of the games that I have not played in my Steam Library and this was one of them.   I had no idea what to expect when we started up the game. I was pleasantly surprised by how much we enjoyed it. This game is an Exploration Puzzle game with odd navigation controls. You soon get used to it and the game becomes a blast. You navigate across 2D planes in first person and hop between layers of the world. First of all, the sound design is peng. The crispyty crunch of the noise of snow under your feet is a very nice and subtle choice and puts you right in the Snowy Swedish Wilderness. The art style was reminiscent of 'Fosters Home for Imaginary Kids' and really suited the shifting tone of Wonder and Dread (Not the Judge). The story is difficult to explain and should be experienced first-hand with all the pieces of the puzzle aligning to make a beautiful mosaic of Swedish folklore. I would valiantly recommend giving this Modern Masterpiece a couple of hours of your time.  Remember Dear Readers, You heard it here first. Off the record, On the QT, and very Hush-Hush.",

            "review_text": "For the longest time I put off buying Year Walk since the price tag versus the average amount of hours reviewers played tended to scare me away. I usually like investing in things I know I'll get a good amount of time out of, and I felt that I could just as easily wait for a sale to get something that I'd spend more time on for around the same price. I know this is incredibly moronic tact to take with games, but I've been burned more often than not on shorter 'experiences' to come to have that reservation.   Having bought and completed Year Walk, I can honestly say I wish I pulled the trigger on the game sooner.  The folklore the game is based on is interesting and a bit unsettling, leading to simple, yet effective scares that managed to stick with me. Wrapped around this is a pretty well done story, that even with accidentally getting spoiled on some of the details, I came away impressed with. While I wouldn't say the puzzles are anything too special, combined with an atmospheric soundtrack and the game's 2.5D first person presentation, they were enough to get me to want to to keep going.  Admittedly, Year Walk might not be everyone's cup of tea. Regardless, if you're looking for something different, I highly recommend taking a chance on it.",
