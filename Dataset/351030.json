            "review_text": "I don't recommend this puzzle game. I wanted to like  Pixel Puzzles Ultimate  but there are too many things that distract or take away from fully enjoying the game:   Larger puzzles (300+ pieces) are too small to see the detail. There is a zoom option but you are zooming in on an already 100% resolution photo. As you zoom, you're met with increasingly blurry pieces to try and put together. Zooming also adds some strange vignetting around the edges of the board, further obscuring any pieces located near sides.   The puzzle preview is too small, this is further complicated by the zoom issue. You end up trying to match tiny pieces off a preview that is a 10% (or less) thumbnail and cannot be enlarged. You can try to zoom on the preview but, again, you are zooming in on an already 100% resolution photo which becomes more blurry as you zoom--plus the edges of the preview also suffer from vignetting the moment you zoom in.   Pieces can't snap together in advance, they can only snap individually into the correct spot on the puzzle. Find two or three pieces that match but don't know where to put them on the board yet? Too bad, you can't do anything with them. You can put near each other, or in one of the drawers, but next time you load the game their position has been discarded.   The game doesn't have a taskbar icon. If you alt+tab out of it you can't use the taskbar to get back into it. You either need to use task manager or alt+tab back into it.   Steam overlay seems to have issues with the game, even on a very powerful PC. (For example F12 to take a screenshot is delayed by about 3 seconds.)   The shapes of the pieces are mostly non-standard. Crazy looping edges which would never work in a real puzzle, this makes matching them by their shape less practical than usual.   The default options are constantly spinning pieces, needing to rotate pieces 4-8 times, and the almost non-existent snap distance takes away from the fun in the larger (300+ piece puzzles). Sure, you can change these the first time they are presented, or later in the menu, but having them as the default option is frustrating.   Overall this is a game that could be fun if they would pay more attention to detail. If you're on the fence try it out--you don't have anything to loose since this is free to start playing. The smaller puzzles (300 or less pieces) are okay but I wouldn't buy any of the larger puzzles unless they start scaling the resolution of the photos accordingly and get rid of the edge vignetting when you zoom in. Often it feels like you are playing a click, drag, and release simulator, hoping to find the snap in spot, rather than using details to piece the puzzle together.",

            "review_text": "Awesome game if you enjoy jigsaw puzzles. It really does an excellent job of bringing jigsaw puzzles to the computer screen, which is rather difficult if you consider the limited space. I especially like that the developers are listening to the users, and are quick to make changes. In fact, most of the things people have been complaining about in the negative reviews have been fixed in today's patch (9/11/2016).  Update: I just did one of the largest puzzles (1000 pc) to see if the game held up to that many pieces. I'm pleased to report it did remarkably well. The 5 puzzle trays provided ample room to divide the pieces by section, and I just threw them back in the puzzle pool when I was ready to work on that section. It took about the same amount of time to do the puzzle as in real life, with the added benefits of:  - not having to turn all the pieces picture side up - being able to use my dining room table for dining - having that warm, cozy feeling of knowing that all the pieces are actually there, and not fallen on the floor to be eaten by my dog (or not even making it into the puzzle box at the manufacturer) - being able to enjoy the completed result without having to break it down to make room for the next puzzle  All in all, a very enjoyable experience. My only disappointment with the game so far is the lack of a golden retriever puppy puzzle in the dogs pack. Everyone knows they are the cutest!  P.S. For those wanting to put pieces together, then move them as a group, there is a simple workaround. Before putting the pieces together, take one of them and move it around on the puzzle board in the approximate location of where it goes (as can be seen using the puzzle picture). Wait for it to lock in, then just build around it. I did all the horses in 'River Crossing' this way before doing the rest of the puzzle. Works like a charm.",

            "review_text": "As an achievement hunter, I love this series. Its a great promise of an achievement unlock when I dont feel like playing anything that requires attention.   I have perfect gamed a few of their other puzzle games and im happy to see it go free to play.   The only thing I dont understand is how it could possibly take any time to release new packs. I mean its a chopped up image, I could automate this fairly easily. I'm going to call it 'testing' and say keep up the good work. But there should really be a lot more puzzles, if you expect anyone to buy a pack for the current prices. I wont likely buy any, short of a sale 2 years from now when they are basically free.   Keep the achievements high, and you will still attract us regardless.",

The game is nearly the same...but there are some problems...  1- (NEGATIVE)snapping is really bad...you know every puzzle has 4 corners (usually :P) i found all of them...but it took 10 minutes to put them at the right places...before i was playing really quickly and finishing the puzzle in a short time...but today i really get bored while playing. By the way...some reviews say that 'there is no snapping outside the board'...is the before??? i don't think so...it's normal for me but before while you were searching the piece was sometimes finding it's place by own :) that's what i'm talking 'bout...  2- (NEGATIVE)before the series have their original sounds...like pixel puzzle space it was like you were at NASA and exploring the moon :) but when i was playing the 'space' puzzles today the music was awful...no no...normally the music is pure jazz and i relly adore it...but while you are making a satellite...it is not the right one...in my opinion...  3- (POSITIVE)at the bottom of screen there are five sections as '0'...first i couldn't understand what they are but then i figured out. when you put a piece at the bar it counts as '1'...then if you put the second one it becomes '2'...ok it's good...and then you can click on the other part and for the first time you can 'divide' your pieces as colour/shape or etc...it is a really good thing for a player.  4-(POSITIVE)the other series have always the same achievements...finish the puzzle...finish the game etc...but now there are several achievements which are really make me happy as a player who likes to achieve :)   5-(POSITIVE)the game is FREE to play...only for 'some' puzzles but it is free  6-(NEGATIVE)the DLC packages are not cheap as the series i played before...for 4 puzzles you have to pay an amount which you payed for the whole game before...it is a big negative for me...  anyway...i am playing it...i liked it...but i won't get game until it becomes cheaper...no way...without a good snapping and a good price i can only play for free...sad but true...  that's why for the first time i have to give 'negavite' vote for this game...i hope things will change...",

            "review_text": "Pay no attention to the nay-sayers of this game for they are like a child that wanders into the middle of a movie.... Seriously, these folks obviously have zero idea the history behind the Pixel Puzzles series. Just a few examples..  'Oh, the pieces are floating and always moving around and hard to get...' Really buddy?? Those pieces are a dream to grab out of the floating pond compared to the second and third pixel puzzles. Seriously, I've had no issues with grabbing pieces like we used to have. And personally, I like it. It simulates shaking the box of a real puzzle around.  'The pieces aren't in the correct direction..' My god why are we even seeing this.... First off the pieces will ROTATE with a right mouse button click. Secondly, I'm sure the last time you went down to the store and bought a puzzle all the pieces were facing the right direction as you pulled them out of the box...RIGHT... You want your pieces to all come out facing the same direction go play some of the older ones where they do. Or play the first Pixel Puzzles where you have to fight zombies while building the puzzle.... That ought to blow your brains...  'I can't put random pieces together in improper locations and have them lock together...' Cause to sooo hard to put a few pieces together somewhere then just pick them up and move them when you figure out where they go? Most times when I assemble pieces together in a random spot on a real life puzzle they wind up falling apart when I try to move them to the proper location anyhow.... Also, you're not really trying here because in digital form there's other tricks you can use that you can't in a real puzzle... like randomly guessing where they go and getting it right through trial and error. Let's see you try that on a real puzzle....  'The devs didn't look at successful puzzle games..' Uhhh, they have made several successful puzzle games in the past man. You obviously didn't look for them before making this comment...  'Please stop accepting crappy mobile games' Now right here is truly someone who doesn't have a clue. Probably never even played the game or he would have known that there's zero way of making this on a mobile device without everyone going blind trying to see those little pieces on their little screens.. Seriously, man, think before you comment.  'I love puzzles but this is just wrong...' No, no you don't or you would have liked this.  I think the problem is that all these people are like a Facebook joke I saw the other day. 2 blonds walk into a bar screaming 'SIXTY TWO!!!' The bartender asks, 'why are you screaming sixty two?' and the blonds replied, 'Because we just finished a puzzle in sixty two days that said two to four years..' Sadly, I'm sure they probably won't get that joke either.  So is the game without flaw?? No, but as far as gameplay goes it is pretty much on par with more recent versions of Pixel Puzzle. Biggest flaw I've seen so far is that I don't care for the pay as you go model charging more money per puzzle than we got in previous editions of the game. Yet I do understand that it is probably the best way to go. I mean, pinball games have been widely successful with the same model. That being said though there are quite a few free puzzles to work though before you'll be paying for them so there's that. At the end of the day I'd say it's as good if not better than previous versions of Pixel Puzzles. It's a great game to chill out to and relax.",

Menus are clunky, and options are spread out and not explained well at all. Had to look up on the forums how to rotate pieces, which is kind of important. Couldn't figure out how to see the final picture of the puzzle, which is kind of important. Accidentally reset the board three times before I understood what saves.  Not angry because it's free, but can't see how trying to navigate what seems like a UI nightmare is relaxing. I'd rather just buy a real puzzle.  ",
