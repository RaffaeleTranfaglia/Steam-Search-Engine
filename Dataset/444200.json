There's no artillery, the maps are small, and matches go very quickly because of it.   You still get your WoT mechanics with penetrations, armor thicker in front, angle of attack deflections, module damages, ammo rack explosions, and crew damage based on hit locations but in a slim fast paced fun design.",

I have seen it improve and develop and I am uncertain why Wargaming haven't released WoT on Steam, however, Blitz isn't all that bad either.  It does decrease the anger due to the removal of Arty, and it allows you to play with Mobile/Tablet/Ipad users. Although, they might not be the ideal way to play a game such as WoT against normal PC players since the controls are easier, it is nice that you can play with Friends or Family.   Do not judge the game by it's looks",

            "review_text": "If you've played World of Tanks on the PC, then you'd know the aspects of it that most players despise. In World of Tanks Blitz: - There is no arty - So in turn, games feel more dynamic - There is +1/-1 matchmaking - Sixth sense is a free perk that comes with all crew - For crew skills, no huge ton of grinding to get them because they transfer between crews  Other pros: - You play against people on their phones, so you get a significant advantage. PCMR - They have animeme tonks  Cons: - Graphics are terrible, but they're what you'd expect for mobile games designed for weaker systems - You can spend gold to research through tanks, unlike in WoT PC where you still need to grind the free-xp.  I'm currently still in the low tiers (tier 6 right now), but it seems like the 7v7 games feel both more team-focused and carry-focused. You can easily sway the outcome of a battle by getting everyone to agree to push through one side. In the chance your entire team dies, you won't have to deal with a 1 vs 15 carry, but a 1 vs 7 carry.  Overall I recommend it if you're a more casual player or if your system can't handle WoT PC. I also do want to say I do actually enjoy this game quite a bit soley because there is no arty. If you're already heavily invested in PC version, enjoy the more competitive aspects, or like the slightly more 'serious' and 'realistic' overall tone, you should leave this alone and go play PC.",

So choose between German, France, USSR, China, UK and USA tanks and battle. The tanks for all countries break down to light, medium and heavy tanks. Each tank has ( and countries) type of tank are designed with specific playing style. But it really comes down to how good are you? your skills? Understanding your tanks ability and type of ammo/shooting and tactic, manuvereing is all key. LOCATION X 3. Yes, that saying, is how you play this game. There are daily missions and a tuturial mission to start you off with good gold/silver for upgrades or research points. Research unlocks tanks or crew skills, and gold/silver gets your tanks provisions, ammo,equipment, and camo. Its all about making your tank the best in every way possible to get that edge in battle. Faster reload or faster repairing? ammo penetration rounds or explosive rounds? Make your tank the way you want with upgrades. Very custimizable. Plenty of camo skins so you look ''individual'' as you can as a heap of moving gun and metal...The maps are neat and with plenty of hiding, ambushing or sniper points for you tank. Games are a capture the point or destroy all other team tanks...up to you. Have fun and hear that BOOM! of your tanks gun, with the gunman yelling PENETRATION!",

Becasue of the smaller maps, and shorter time limit team-mates cannot just camp the whole game. This makes for a much more dynamic game. Who cares if it is a mobile port. Runs great on my HP laptop.",

The game is great, it's basically a downscaled and simplified version of the original World of Tanks, it has less tanks than the original, and less maps. it still has micro-transactions in it that is available in most free-to-play games. However, micro-transactions only allow you to progress faster in the tech tree, the further you are on it, the tougher your enemies. The micro-transactions are not pay-to-win  The gameplay isn't very different from the original World of Tanks, only that it's faster, the maps are smaller, and matches generally last less than 5 minutes. a new armor highlighter system has been added for this version of the game, letting players see which parts of the armor are easier to penetrate. this however, may turn off some of the more hardcore players, you must understand however, that World of Tanks Blitz is designed as a casual game, not a heavily competitive one.  progression is somewhat of a grind, where you have to collect xp coins to upgrade your tanks, and to progress in the tech tree. as mentioned earlier, there are less tanks in the Blitz version of the game, however, regular updates every month or so add more tanks and armored vehicles into the game.  graphics is as previously said, the same as the original world of tanks, but downscaled. the textures are not as sharp, and the models are simplified.  overall, it is in my opinion that it's a great game and worth a try for anyone who likes simple and fast tank combat. if the beta is closed on steam but you still want to play this game, you are able to download it on your mobile phone or from the Windows store",

I dunno &amp; i don't care all i know is that it's a good game. I'm not looking at this like 'Oh for shame on you WG.. We wanted WoT on steam.. &amp; this is how you pay us? With WoT Blitz? UNACCEPTABLE!' If your like that. Fine! Go play World of tanks. But WORLD OF TANKS BLITZ is DIFFERENT!! They both do great at what they want to portait here. WoT(big WoT) is great at realism while WoTB(Baby WoT) is good for those who have a terrible computer &amp; still want the World of Tanks expirience. In my opinion they are both different games, you cant say that one is worse that the other cause one of them is originaly a mobile game. AND dont say that WoT(Big WoT) is a saint. Cause your wrong. They both have thier flaws, &amp; thier stengths. But they also have different audiences. WoTB is for people who dont like the console version but yet still wants a competitive yet fair playing field in a quick matter. While WoT(The one that EVERYBODY is saying that you should go DL instead) is for those who want to play a game that is a bit more detailed &amp; historicaly driven but pretty is much the same. imo. I mean c'mon your still shooting enemy tanks &amp; if you do damage credits &amp; XP come out.",

World of Tanks Blitz is quite the same as its big brother but more nervous and fast paced due to smaller arenas and smaller teams.  Drive a tank and work (or rather try to) with your teammates to defeat the enemy team by anihilating it or capturing zones. Individual skill has a meaningful impact as every teammate or enemy killed weighs quite a lot in the balance, and the lack of SPG in the game removes the biggest threat there was to the Heavy Tanks, making the assaults more brutal and relentless than ever.  Contrary to WoT PC, the feel you get at low tier is quite similar to the feel you get at higher tiers since you no longer have to cover a lot of ground to see the action and the lack of 'capture the enemy base goal' means that your team no longer camps (at least not too much).

But the crew skills are WAY more useful i give it that  EVERYONE is shooting Gold ammo in this game, dont even bother with heavy tanks  In short, if you want to feel competitive in this game,play only the russian line,dont play heavy tanks cause almost everyone is shooting Gold ammo.Fun on Tablets,but dont see a reason to play it on PC.
