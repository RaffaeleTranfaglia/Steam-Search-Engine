As the game progress you can combine cubes to make a cannon, wall, power plant, etc...  This game is quite hard too. You need to consider where you build your things to maximize your your power. To get perfect score (4 stars) you have to finish the level flawlessly (collect all the batteries, finish below the time limit and taken no damage at all).",

But, Cubetractor is pretty much a retro-ish game with happy music and the gameplay is about pulling cubes together to create towers that shoot cubes, barries and all kinds of fun stuff. The game gets harder as more enemies pop up during your adventure. There is side levels aswell, that are more like challenge levels. Keep in mind, i have not completed the game fully, so i cannot say what is there in the end etc. But overall, it's a fun experience i enjoy playing. ''It's a good timewaster'' in short. 8.5 outta 10 ",

            "review_text": "The combination of a slight delay needed for every input, the coordination required for building, and the fact that you take damage from everything including the blocks you use to build stuff results in an extremely frustrating underlying experience. To make matters worse, you are stopped dead anytime you take damage, and this on top of the slight delay built into the game creates a very odd start-stop style that makes coordination even more annoying and frustrating then it might've been otherwise.  Stay away unless, well, you've seen gameplay and thought 'I must play that' on sight. If you're on the fence, it's probably not worth it.",

You play a robot, who is able to pull certain cubes either horziontal or vertical. Once moved they keep on moving, smashing everything in their way (critters, towers and, yes, even you). The tower part comes in, when you are able to pull two blocks on the same spot. They combine and you get a tower. Now imagine pulling blocks, while being chased by homing missles, getting attacked by critters and shot at by dozens REALLY fast shooting towers.  Yeah, I like it, but man, this game will take some time. They could've at least made the 'pull THOSE two blocks at exactly THAT spot'-excercise easier Oo'... dunno, maybe a marker for when to pull or something.",

When it started to get a bit harder, the difficulty was purely due to the action elements, the strategy required in the level was obvious. That might be okay, but the controls are also not great, despite being very simple.  ",
