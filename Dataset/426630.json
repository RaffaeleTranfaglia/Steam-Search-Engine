            "review_text": "For the time, the game had purrfectly acceptable level design; it just didn't age well in the face of the relatively homogenized (milk pun? Sure, let's go with that), and, honestly, much betfur ubiquitious one-lane, always-move-right standard we have today.   So, think the level design is bad? Keep dying on the first stage? I can actually get to stage 7 with all nine lives, at this point, and I'll tell you how.  Think of every level as having 4+ 'planes', none of which necessarily intfuract with one another well. There's sometimes a 'dungeon' plane, there's the ground, there's the roof-plane, and there are usually 2-3 regions above the roofs.   Jumping to a higher plane is dangfurous! The combination of the game's camera + Bubsy's ridiculously high jump (sorry, Bubsy, you can't jump out of your own game :( ) makes jumping an arduous endeavfur, but...  You have to be /extremefurly/ carefur about jumping UP to a higher plane, but, the game is immeownsely generous when heading downwards. So, stake out a place without enemies, jump upwards for a while, and then glide downwards. You can clear 20-40% of the level this way per leap, and, while gliding, the zoom and controls actually opfurate in a manfur that makes the game feel /fair/. Bubsy will almost never die while gliding (unless you get as unlucky as Bubsy's career), and, by staying either within your 'plane' or only heading downwards at high speeds, the game suddenly turns into the Mario/Sonic fusion it's sometimes accused of trying to be.   So, uh, yeah. I like puns, I love the way this game plays like an interactive cartoon, and, hopefully, by assuaging some of people's completely justified rage about the level design, more people can see the pawsitives inherent. Just climb to a meowntain and glide.  Also, it's still better than No Man's Sky.",

If you are a fan of the mascot craze of the 90s and 2-D platformers, then you need to play the Bubsy games! I wanna see the ol bobcat running free in a new title someday!",

An emulator running a console version of a 2D platformer with control pad support removed... what? I have no interest in playing this without it, it is not a game suited to keyboard controls.",

Anyone who uses Emulators knows they've just thrown these on Steam using an emulation system. The game is laggy, sound is laggy and its an early basic game. The fact that this game runs BETTER on an emulator and rom version of it i downloaded both for FREE is severely disappointing. And its not my PC, if i can run high graphic games like ESO, TESV and TF2 with limited issues, a simple game like this should not lag!  Buy only at a discount... or not at all... or maybe just for the cards... so disappointed i cant play this properly. 'What could possibly go wrong?' &lt;-- Everything!",

        {
            "review_text": "UPDATE: The game was finally patched so Bubsy 2 no longer constantly crashes but the update also completely broke controller support for me. I used to be able to play the first game fine using either a PS3 or 360 controller, now none of them work even if I reinstall the game. Also, the function keys for quick loading do absolutely nothing.  As it is, the first Bubsy is a classic and the eponymous character really does stand out as a great character design. The game however is poorly balanced, unfair and at times completely unwieldy. It tries real hard to be like the classic Sonic games, but what you get is a Sonic-wannabe who dies from fall damage and running into walls too fast.   There are some very cool ideas for stages and gimmicks, such as the multi-part desert/train stages and the black shirt power-up - but no matter how good they are, the assets are recycled ad-nauseum and get repetitive real fast.  The sequel, Bubsy 2, fixes some of the problems from Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind - you no longer instantly die from taking any sort of hit and the enemy designs and stages are much better and much more varied with added gimmicks like shooter segments and mini games. You also have a choice in which order you want to tackle the stages which certainly makes the game less punishing in the long term. The game does suffer from inconsistent frame rates however can be really sluggish but I can't tell if it's due to poor emulation or if this was really what the original was like.  Either way, it’s Bubsy and if you’re here looking to buy, then you’re probably either getting it out of pure nostalgia - in which case this review won’t matter - or you’re a glutton for punishment like me. But with all of the technical issues of this port, I can’t recommend it for either of those groups at this time. It’s one thing to be schooled by old-school Nintendo-hard games, and another thing entirely to get stuck trying to find workarounds for controls that are completely broken.  Joy2Key does work but can be a pain to set up.",
