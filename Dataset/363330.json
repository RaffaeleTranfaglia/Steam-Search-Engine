The levels changing very, some could come from a fairy tail other are cruel science fiction. Its a look inside the strange minds of this world. A nice quality of details. Sure no master piece but i see something that you not see ;) 8.2 of 10.0 points who love this art of genre.",

            "review_text": "Overall it was quite ok, but all the puzzles feel a little to familiar, as it's all just recycled from other Artifex Mundi games. The story also fails to gain real traction, it starts out somewhat interesting, but then just paddles along without really advancing much at all. The most frustrating part however is the ending, which there isn't any of, the game just ends without any kind of epilogue or even a proper cliffhanger. This makes the whole experience feel kind of pointless and empty.",

Chapter 2 was my favourite. I really liked the theme. There was a different theme in each chapter which made it more interesting.",

Pros: Ok voice acting for what there is, but the third chapter is suspiciously like a middle school haunted house. Beautiful HOG scenes, nice environments Decent story I laughed at the pumpkins.  Cons:  Super short, even for a HOG game. 2 hours and no extra chapters. Nothing really innovative. Same old minigames and puzzle styles.  Decent. Pick it up in a bundle, or don't pay more than 3 or 4 bucks for it by itself.",

Then when I finished the chapter I was like 'Is that it?' Then I said 'So that's why I didn't get a map!'   The chapter or I should say game ended so abruptly that I was like I wish the game had a proper ending. So keep that in mind if you don't like to play games that pretty much had such an abrupt ending.",

            "review_text": "This is my review of Mind Snares: Alice Journey.  I was on ♥♥♥ and found out that they would sell random Steam keys for quite cheap. Me and My Associate thought it would be funny to purchase one and play the game, no matter how bad it looked. This is the product of that experience, and I have to say that We were very pleasantly surprised.  From the outside, this doesn't look like the most appealing game in the world. We thought that it would be kind of naff and a bit dull. The gameplay can be described as straight forward Point and Click Puzzler with Elements of Where's Wally. The art really grows on you and has the same type of charm that you would find in Alice: Madness Returns (It's not only the name that they share in common.)  The plot isn't the strongest point of this game, but it works as the carriage to help understand the setting and gameplay elements. The gaming formula does become quite tiresome towards the end of Alice's Journey, but there is still fun to be had. I would recommend that you give this game a shot at least once, and We shall be trying out some of the creators other games in the future.  Remember Dear Readers, You heard it here first. Off the record, On the QT, and very, Hush-Hush.",
