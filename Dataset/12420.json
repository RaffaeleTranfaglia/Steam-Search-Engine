Two sides, two advantages, capture mechanics (it's been a very long time, i remember capturing something), generate your power levels unlock new buildings, build units to defend or attack, turn towers into defences, use ground or water as weapons. Create a long gameplay by flooding back the enemy using water, or build the tallest plateu with ground. Artillery is an option.  The game had much promise, very similar to maelstrom, but of course without the masses of armies and first person view of a hero.  That all being said, the problem is how the game is not going to work for everyone, it ran out of compatibility for some systems, while it had compatibility for others with the same hardware, go figure.  I enjoyed it while it lasted when i first had it, but eventually after changing systems i couldn't play it without a crash. Also the variety and diversity in the end just run out, nothing new to do, nothing new to find, just kill that in your own way capture that somehow, etcetcetc. A one way ticket to a game that has no real end, until you decide when you had enough.",
