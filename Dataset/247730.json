I love this game, even though the mechanics of the game is similar in a way to H1Z1 and DayZ, this one is more of a unique one. The world design, lighting, environment is great.  And now since Phosphor Games is back developing Nether, I can't wait what they will bring to Nether now as they removed microtransactions, Nether is no longer P2W!   I hope Phosphor Games continue to develop this game and turn it to a better game in the future.",

            "review_text": "Don't buy this game. It's a broken, buggy, confusing mess of disparate elements, hastily cobbled together with little thought, ugly mechanics obscured with pretty graphics and buzz-words like 'sandbox' and 'hardcore survival' thrown around to lure in the unwary.  Pros: - This is a good-looking game, at least from a distance. - It sports a fairly large game world which feels lived-in and real. - Excellent atmosphere replete with background noise, harsh wind and insect buzzing. It pulls off that desolate post-apocalyptic feel better than any game I can think of besides Metro 2033 and Last Light. - Good overall sound design  Cons: - It's poorly optimized and chokes even the highest-end PC's and lowering the video settings to minimum doesn't help much. It tries to compensate by un-rendering many props at a ridiculously short distance.  - Confusing everything. You get a 'tutorial mission' the first time you play, which explains a few things, but not nearly enough of essential info. Hours into the game, I still didn't know what I was doing. Something's wrong when you don't explain why there are invincible, immobile enemies spawned in clusters throughout the world. - Enemy encounters are surprisingly rare outside of periodically attacked outposts. That said, when you do encounter more than 1 or 2, you can be killed within seconds. Because AI pathfinding is hard, the enemies always teleport behind you, and warp away when attacked because they're also dumb as rocks, so the devs had to make them as cheap as possible so that they wouldn't be just cannon fodder. - NPC traders only accept specific combinations of items, so you're stuck lugging around meaningless junk for much of the game. - Randomly generated 'quest' system which is nothing but deliver box A to shop B. This wouldn't be so bad if getting around in this game didn't take an eternity. Oh, and of course they have weight values and clog up your initially tiny inventory. Also, each random quest box can only be turned in at one NPC. This is literally the most half-♥♥♥♥♥ 'quest' system I've ever seen in a game. - What makes this worse is you lose everything when you die. That's fine for players who want to feel super hardcore and macho, but that's going to turn off a ton of new players who aren't even given a chance to get comfortable with the mechanics. - Random health pickups strewn throughout the world aren't enough to keep you alive and health regenerates excruciatingly slowly. - Only a handful of servers, usually just one per game mode and region, most of which seem buggy as hell. - Unwieldy, confusing UI. No way to track other players or friends... unless they have to join your tribe first, and in that case, F that. - This game seems to have been either abandoned by its developer or they just don't care. Controller support has been broken for months, private servers were promised since the beginning and still haven't surfaced, hackers are running rampant and unchallenged, etc. Apparently, they can't even do something as simple as send a forgotten password email... 3 times. I just happened to remember mine or I'd be SOL.",

I really hope they can bring the game back to life and give me a reason to change this reivew to a positive one! I'll keep an eye on the updates and give the game a few plays when anything major changes!  It pains me deeply to give this game a negative review but there is so much wasted potential here. I truly love this game (or rather, what this game could be) and I wish it was developed more and with much more care and attention.  The gameplay is your standard survival genre, scavenge for food and weapons while hiding from monsters called 'Nether' and other players. The nether mechanics are buggy and frustrating to play against, giving everything a teleport mechanic is just a lame way of saying 'we don't know how to make different enemies so we'll just re-model the same enemy and adjust it's health and damage'. The guns are good and have a nice feel to them, ammo is a pain to get put into one stack and the weight limits are just too restrictive. You have a global inventory which acts like a bank but again, you can only store a certain weight and size limit of items meaning you feel the need to keep your best weapons safe by leaving them there instead of using them, making them rather pointless. The graphics are actually very good considering the state of the rest of the game and the lighting is great apart from metalic surfaces being a bit too reflective in my opinion.  Overall, this game is 10% of what it could have been and that's a damn shame.  If you have a couple of friends who'd buy this game, it's worth the small £7 price tag but otherwise - as much as it pains me to say it, I'd stay clear of this game.",

This is my first review and felt because of the overwhelming bad reviews I wanted to add some good/bad points of my own.  1. I've heard a few times that people can pay to win...this is just not true. You can't buy weapons or any item that will give you an advantage over another player. Now if a freaky looking mask is your idea of pay to win then yes...people will be able to purchase masks in game for real money but these items have zero stats.  2. Teamwork! This is key in a survival game...I've heard time and time again where people hate this game because they get killed while starting out. To be quite honest I love when I have nothing on me. I'll go out of my way to find people and stab them in the back to take what they have. Find people to play with...plan out where you are going and what you are gonna do if 'X' or 'Y' happens. Will this prevent you from getting killed? Nope...YOU WILL DIE. There was a time I kille four people with a shotgun in a building and got over run by Nether and died myself. That is the way of this world and if you can't handle the loss of items then do not pick this game up.  3. For awhile I stopped playing the game because of hackers...mainly aimbotters who ruined it for me but since the update I've not run into any WTF moments of people turning 180 to headshot me in 0.2 seconds flat.  4. No storyline stuff is in the game yet from what I can tell.  5. Nether invasion of towns are freaking HARD to clear out considering the massive spawn rate of nether but one would assume that they would swarm a town like that if given the chance. Again if you have a few guys with you and people who know how to play then you can do it.  6. Did I mention you will die? Cause you're gonna die...a lot and my best advice...learn to laugh about it and understand you're...gonna....DIE! You will not have that bad ♥♥♥ DR-mag forever. You'll round the corner and have a TFC special smiling at you as it all fades to white.  So would I reccomend this game? Depends on what type of games you like and if you have a rage issue when it comes to getting ganked. If you rage like a little 6 year old girl.....no...don't buy this game cause I don't want you getting your rage on in chat after I ♥♥♥♥ you with a katana while you spray and pray with your mac9.

That changed after a patch introduced a game breaking bug that wasn't fixed for the longest time, where you could prone and become invincible. Then, the hacker problem began to arise from this. Not to mention money exploits where you could get so much money that you could simply buy the best gear and meds, and all you had to do was find guns. After this was the hitbox breaking. You couldn't shoot anyone who was jumping and half of your shots on stationary players and things wouldn't register. Now, the only thing keeping the old community from playing is the hacker issue that we get no direct acknowledgement of from the developers. The game is dead in it's current state. It is no longer as fun as it used to be, maybe not even at all. Hackers will keep coming and reducing the price to 'NOW 9.99!!!!' won't help unless Phosphor is damn sure of it's anticheat. Or whoever runs the game anymore.  Edit as of 6/24/2015: Clearly the developers have abandoned / have little care for the game, seeing as the last update at all for the game was over 6 months ago, going on about 10 to a year. The game is dead, regardless of who still plays it, it is dead.  Edit as of 2016: The game was picked up by the original developers again in an attempt to remarket the game as 'Nether: Resurrected.' While the game lasted for a solid 2 months under this nomenclature, and I ran the most popular US server for the game, it eventually went under and is no longer receiving updates. I applaud Phosphor, the developers, for attempting to revive the game and giving us the ability to run our own servers as a community, but sadly the game is permanently dead, topping out at around 15 people TOTAL playing the game across all servers combined.  So as a result, I'm not going to recommend the game to anybody and suggest you do not buy this game unless you want to play it for single player PvE purposes.",

And i honestly tried to give this game a chance, and after i screamed and cursed i put it down and came back to give it a couple more chances. But in the end a game is only worth playing if it gives you some sort of positive entertainment. The map is not that big, but they compensate by making you move irritatingly slow, you have a sprint but it only lasts a little while until you get a penalty for sprinting to long and cant use sprint for a short time. Monsters are irritating to fight because you cant use terrain to run from them, you cant out run them at all, and if there is more than 2 you probably dead unless you have a great weapon. Why? Because the monsters in nether can teleport... thats right, they dont run at you, they just teleport to the rooftop your on because you aggrovated them from the 2nd floor. If thats not bad enough, they disable safe havens from time to time so its not safe there either, one moment your looking through your inventory, next your getting gangbanged by elite nether monsters that teleport to you as you run for dear life. And thats not even the bad part, people just sit outside the safehavens waiting for you to leave so they can blast you in the back of the head. Take all your stuff, and guess what, all the exp you earned to level up your character is now reset. You go back to having your butter knife no items and level 1. Whats the point of even having levels if the guy who has a sniper is going to one shot you back to lvl 1? I'm actually upset, this is the first time i bought a game, gave it a real honest go, and been thoroughly upset i ever spent money on it. All the items you can get in the store, you can also spend real money on. And the prices for a someone who bought the standard game is rediculous, played the game for 8 hours and had 1000 bucks, a paintball mask costs 10000.....really? You bet your ♥♥♥ spending 5 dollars of real money would be easier, and not as much of a waste of time.

Even if they just said that they were working on the issues, it would would have been enough to make people hang on. But with their utter lack of transparency, people just become tired of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and quit. When Phosphor Games ended up leaving development for the game to Pure FPS, I really hoped the'd make some positive changes, but I don't think there's been an update since about August of last year (2014). I really hoped that the new devs might be able to bring this game back to what it used to be, and if that becomes the case then I will gladly rejoin.

My computer isn’t the best so it was laggy, but still playable. I enjoyed running around, finding loot, dodging players, even working with some. Then came more updates. By the end of the beta I feel that Nether hit rock bottom. It was losing players by the week and many of their updates were turning into fixes and unnecessary content. Then they announced that they were moving out of beta into the official stage. I was surprised by this move. Now recently I have learned that the original developers have returned after the torch was passed to someone else. I didn't realize that the development tea had even changed, but I'm glad to see the old developers back. I will not be changing my thumbs down just yet though. I need some time to explore the reboot.

It gets old very fast, especially as a solo player. This may be fun with friends, but I don't have anyone in my friendlist who would want to play this. Also, at first the environment may look interesting, but you then come to realise that everything is just a copy and paste.

The game has loads of bugs, you will get stuck on random things constantly, the graphics are alright but a bit bright. The fact you lose everything on death really sucks and takes alot of the fun out of the game (unless your one of those no-life people who enjoy gaining the same levels over and over again) as far as i can see the game doesn't even bother to take care of hackers so be prepaird to die... alot...  all in all i give this game a 2/10  skip it and go play something better.",

One friend couldn't even log into the game as the patcher send him through a seemingly infinite process of trying to link the steam account to a nether account which is impossible. Me and my other two friends managed to get through without that problem but we were faced with a number of crashes and bugs which made it impossible to get into a server.

I honestly think that this game has great potential but it needs some drastic changes to its mechanics. Especially colission detection. Oh and not to mention, the leveling system and the scavaging system SUCKS beyond all reason. You die, you go to level 0. WHO THE HELL DOES THAT IN A GAME? The diversity to characters are crappy at best and if you really want to 'have fun' Then you are urged, like a money drone, to buy the game with the chosen or believer bonuses. Which in my opinion is a grand waste of money that could be spent on games that are being more thuroughly developed. This game feels old and clunky at times. Also, the skeletons and items you find in the game look bigger than any human being I have seen. It is stupid and needs to be fixed. Id recommend that the scavaging system be hammered out to being so much more specific and grandios. Like Rust or The Forest. Perhaps that would make the game that much better.",

So I played for about 10 minutes today. I got to start in the world instead of town, so didn't have to worry about being killed right out of town by the people that do nothing but camp there all day, so that was a plus. The world is still extremely empty, I found not 1 item while looking around...and having nothing but a knife grows old when others all seem to have guns.. I still got stuck in a wall, more awesome fun. Once out in the world I actually saw somebody else runnign a mission I guess. I went to go after them, had a huge fall into water. I went for it, survived the jump, then the second I stepped out of the water I died...no clue how. So, while I hate to give a bad mark on something because people put hard work into this stuff (usually), unless they fix some stuff, I do not recommend this game.

Upon first playing Nether, I was excited by the concept of a large, open-world survival game, with 'PVP' elements. But after playing throughout the Early-access period, I found that what was being developed was just a remake of WarZ. Essentially, it's groups of over-powered gangs killing new players, with the odd alien-thing thrown in. Please, don't fall for the £3 price tag, you'll be dissappointed with it.",

            "review_text": "My experience with this game have been a rollercoaster, the first hour i spent was trying to get into a server &amp; actually play the game. Although the game feels like it's still in Alpha, I actually really enjoyed the game once I got started. The downside is, that it is one rough start, you'll find yourself scared, lonely, hunted by the nether or the ruthless players who kills on sight. Heck you'll even spend a couple of minutes to try and find your friend who you bought the game with.  But now, you've found eachother &amp; you're thinking what now?  You go out scavenging for supplies, sneaking past nethers who seem very scary at first, and you feel like you're powerless. But now you and your friend decide to try and take it down, you get a feel for the combat and realize they aren't so bad. Now you've leveled up, you have no idea what the different skills do, what's good? what's bad? you decide because you're a viking, you'll skill up in melee combat. But right as you skill up and start moving again, your friend gets shot by another play, you panic, you run around in circles and what not. You now know how dangerous it is to be in the open. You think you see the other play, you only have a kitchen knife and the dude who just shot your friend is picking up the stuff you just scavenged together. You decide to go for revenge, you hack &amp; slash at the player and you bring him down, he explodes with items all over the ground. You now feel satisfied, you've taken down another player with a damned knife. Now that you've picked up the players rifle &amp; gear, will you start hunting other players just like he did? or will you try and protect players from nether &amp; make new friends. That's all up to you.   The game has it's keeping players in it's grasp, in my opinion it's the satisfaction of killing someone geared &amp; taking down the hordes of nethers. Sure, the game has it's glitches &amp; issues, it truly is tough getting into the game, through the glitches etc, but once you've died the first 10 times maybe more maybe less, you get the feeling of the game, you want revenge on the nether that killed you the first time, you want to find that player and hunt him down for killing your friend. And you do it.  The leveling system is also a good thing in this game, the character levels you lose upon death, like most survival games. But you still keep your account level, which i find awesome, so you don't feel like you wasted too much time leveling up, you still have small perks from your account level that keep you going.  To wrap it up, you want to look at this game as it's still in alpha, expect alot of glitches, unmercyfull players &amp; nethers. And expect to die quite a bit. But you wan't to stick to the game cause it is just downright awesome when you get into the gameplay.",

For someone like me who doesn't really commit to any particular game, this game is impossible. Nethers aggro very easily and you lose all of your equipment when you die. On top of that other players will 99% try to kill you to loot your weapons, ammo and healing items. Yes, you get a chance to recover your dropped items when you die, but if you happen to die far from a spawn point then tough luck, chances are, you'll either die again on your way there from nethers or other player OR your dropped items have already despawned. very frustrating when you have spent the last 2 hours farming to get a weapon and lose it the next minute.  Also, this game is not for people who likes to play solo. you will get swarmed by either nethers or other players. so if you will get this game even after reading this review, better make sure you join a tribe.  So nether would be an amazing game for people who are totally into PvP FPS. But it is definitely not for me, I would rather play something that would give me less challenge but allow me to explore the world without dying every 15 minutes and lose all of my gear.",

Guns are horribly imbalanced, and the company seems to not have any care for updating their game. The new gamemode they added in, is equally as bad. Everyone just camps super hardcore, making those players who are dead having to sit and watch seven or more minutes of people crouched in a corner hiding like that's the objective of the game.

I just can't believe it's even being sold as a full game, instead of early access right now, I was actually kinda hyped for this, but now I would rather play literally anything else. I feel like there has to be something in this game that I'm just completely missing, because as far as i can tell from like 2 hours of playing is you just wander around, pick up random junk, that can't really be used for anything most the time, and just keep wandering around until another player spots you, kills you, takes all your ♥♥♥♥ and then you start all over again, the entire game lacks a point, there's just nothing you can achieve as far as i can see, the most you can get is a better weapon, which isn't that useful, most of the NPC enemies can be killed with ease by the starting weapons, and player fights come down mainly to whoever shoots first. Health and food are pretty negligible too, just from scrounging i easily found enough ♥♥♥♥ to survive. I don't have DayZ (but i really want it) but from what I've seen of that game, it's what Nether want's to be, except in Dayz you actually find useful ♥♥♥♥, find health items, food, new armour and weapons and you use it to fight off zombies and players or find a good hideout and to survive, which is what this genre is about. This game lacks all of that, surviving isn't hard, unless a player kills you or you stand in the water there's very little in the world that can actually kill you. In this you're just a glorified scrounger, picking up junk waiting to be killed by another player. And I'm not even mentioning the laggy/buggy UI, menu, movement system, the broken graphics engine, or whatever the hell is going on with the water, I'm just focusing on the gameplay.  This game needs a LOT of work to be considered average, but it does show some glimmers of being an interesting survival game.",

This game is NOT full release, despite what the 'developers' and rabid few fans (likely because of how easy the game is to hack, dupe items, camp, etc.) may say. Just drop by the forums for a few and take a look at what people are saying there.  The game is, in my opinion (for what it's worth, I have participated in 19 different alphas / beta's of various games) still in alpha stage, NEARING beta, but not nearly there yet. The claim of being 'full release' is utter nonsense, and you WILL be disappointed if you spend money on this game.  Specifics you say ? terrible hit detection, terrible, non intuitive crafting system, terrible 'quest' system (consists of running from point A to point B to deliver a cardboard box. over ... and over ... and over again.) TERRIBLE inventory management. there is a space and weight system, neither of which correlates with reality or common sense (its being used to essentially keep people from carrying more than a standard load of weapons, which is a huge hinderance when trying to gather loot)   Typical F2P pricing scheme in marketplace where the in game currency vs cash currency is monumentally lopsided, which is to be expected.   water kills you. and by kills you I mean this alpha state game is so glitchy, if you go into the water and try to swim, you have something like a 90% chance of getting stuck on invisible geometry, and unable to escape the water which you just found out damages you slowly. The solution offered by a helpful player in game ? 'bunny hop across the water' yes indeed, because the programmers couldn't do water without making it a deathtrap, you get to bounce giddily about as you frantically mash the space bar in order to skim the surface without getting stuck and slowly withering away in a pond of what i presume must be toxic sludge that just looks like water.  did i mention invisible geometry ? its not just in the water folks! thats right, randomly whilst walking about, you get to discover the myriad number of invisible dirtbike ramps strewn about, suddenly hovering 10 feet above the ground on some mystery object you cant see. Which is nowhere near as enjoyable as the stairs, steps, and ladders EVERYWHERE that you cant walk up without first wiggling your way past the invisible forcefield at the first step. Best technique ? mash that space bar while moving back and forth!   Some of you may have read a review a while back, when the game was first submitted for early access, talking about he 'verticality' of the game, and how it added a whole new depth to the game, sneaking your way in terror through vast skyscrapers, nether creatures shrieking nearby! spooky! ... Guess what ? complete and utter bull****! MOST of the buildings you cant even enter, the ones you can, 90% of them have a single floor, which would be the ground floor. 8% of the remaining have ... *gasp* two stories! the second of which you might have to struggle for 5 minutes with those darned invisible forcefields to get to, but when you do, gosh! the verticality of looking 10 virtual feet to the ground! Its almost as if you're soaring with the eagles! or mutant bats in this case. the remaining 2% ? i think i've found maybe 5 buildings, total, so far, which have more than 2 floors. and these exciting buildings are literally just one giant open room on each floor, with a giant plank ramp leading to the next floor, over and over and over. Verticality must mean something along the lines of 'uninspired and unoriginal' the level design literally looks like CS_Mansion, and i'm talking about the one from Counterstrike beta 3.1 ish ... like ... what ... 5 ? 6 ? 8 ? how many years ago was it ?  I could keep going, theres a LOT more to complain about, as this game is fundamentally broken and unintuitive in just about every way you can imagine... except for the subways ... those are nifty... and spooky for about 5 minutes till you realise that for some reason, the creepy scary nethers apparently dont like creepy, dark abandoned subways ... which makes the subways a lot less creepy.  Other positives ? ... the guns feel relatively distinctive for the most part, although theres not much in the way of variety. And despite the fact that they 'feel' different, there are basically only two worth trying to get, and stock up on, for pvp (which is what this game IS, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but be aware if youre thinking of buying that the nethers are just background noise, similiarly to DayZ these days, the other players are the real monsters) annd ... well ... thats about it ... I got about ... 5 nice 'ohS***!!' crap my pants moments, all in the first 30 minutes or so... the problem is, after that first 30 minutes, i had literally already done EVERYTHING this game has to offer. Theres such a draught of content that once you realize theres really nothing else to do, you end up just looking for some poor helpless newbies to lure out of the safezone and then promptly execute ...  I want to keep going ... I want to write a book about how unfinished this game is... but i know most wont even make it this far TL:DR,  This game has VERY few redeeming qualities ... i think like .. two ... maybe. other than that, its terrible, feels, plays and crashes like an alpha, not a 'full release' title, and i think steam better start considering refunds for those of us who got duped. At the same time, it has its funnish moments ... but theyre just not worth the pain. Stay away!  Overall rating ? 2.5/10  Graphics: 6/10 Sound: 4/10 (some sounds are fantastic! the screams of the nethers are pretty great ... but most are terrible) Design: 1.5/10 (Most repetitive game world i've seen since ... literally ... the 90's ... we're talking Playstation 1 fps level design here, its just sad) Content: 1/10 (like mentioned above, I literally did EVERYTHING there is to do in the first hour or so of playtime.  Fun!: 3/10 (for the first couple hours, I kept pretending not to notice all the glitches and rough edges, after the first couple of hours, my soul had been crushed to the point that I couldn't pretend anymore, and now here I am writing my very first review ...)",

I found that when I started the game and joined a server I was in spectator mode and I could only fly around the map and I couldnt even exit the game without forcing it to shut down, and I found out lots of people had this problem. If you have this problem the only solution I found is that you had to simply wait for the menu to appear, which toke about 15 minutes. Sometimes looting does not work and I've encountered situations where the game simply didnt even register my melee attacks. I don't like how when you die you don't necessarily lose everything. You can store some equipment in like a safe bank where you can retreive them whenever you want, including when you die. some people will like this but I think survival games should make you start from scratch when you die to create more of a risk to the game. And this seems to be a very unsocial game as when you see anyone they just shoot you on sight for you loot. However this is a fun, fast-paced, heartpumping game. I think this game has lots of potential but hopefully more updates come to fix bugs because this game can get very frusterating as I was randomly kicked from servers. I don't really recommend Nether at its full price ($14.99) due to its amount of bugs, glitches and pure frustration which you WILL rage quit like I did, but on the summer sale it may be worth it at $2.99. This game is different and has great potential. Even after bugging out of the game I still found myself wanting to join again. So it is fun and if all those problems were fixed I would really love this game. 7/10",

But, if you're unlucky enough to be one who has bought it later than anyone from early access (ie anyone who buys it after reading this comment...) You will just be doing the 'run' part and hope you won't be shot.. SAFEZONES! THEY ARE GREAT!! you can run towards them in hope that one of the 50 people on that server camping the safezone will fail to notice you. Finally found a gun? to bad try to put it in your global inventory to keep it safe, but you will just be shot trying to get to a safe area.   Leveling and xp! you work hard, finally unlock the perk at the very end of the bar that is actually useful and then you lose it upon death (or, in my case, everytime I leave the game..) and have to wait to get even the first ♥♥♥♥♥♥ perks again. Dont get me wrong, leveling is actually quite easy, but you are sure to die before getting the good perks.  Weapons- buy or find a katana... most of the other melee weapons suck... and guns do great damage but will you have enough ammo to defeat the monsters that heard it from a mile away?... The answer is no. Fighting is rather annoying just stay in 1 sport and keep doing 360 spins to see where the monster will teleport from..and keep it at bay 1 atk at a time. Spawning with a crappy butter's knife (game calls it butter's knife not butter knife idk why) these battles against the weakest monsters and players will last forever. And Lets also hope that you dont get a buggy monster that can hurt you but cannot be hurt until you move around for a minute or two.  Missions-pick up package drop off at one place get another one and repeat with the rewards which may include but are not limited to money (which you will probably lose when you die in 5 minutes) xp (same asa money) and of course! another package to continue your epic journey of quest venturing.  Pros: -Gun mechanics are good.  - Graphics look nice, I really enjoy the scenery.  - Tribes system is interesting and I do like how it can be cooperative (until you get betrayed in an hour or so and lose everything you have..)  -I do enjoy the Hunger and stamina which rewuire you to find food (I like it but its not to say its not annoying as well, you will probably starve to death in all of 10 minutes because you fill your hunger bar up with 2 bags of chips anyway)",

Pay for cash currency and ingame obtainable currency can be traded for items in a 'safe zone' in both or either currency near a global inventory market stall. You can buy consumables, backpacks, vanity items and melee weapons, after purchase they get deployed in your current character's inventory.  You start with a server list. After joining a server with max. 64 players you can choose your character's appeareance, some appearences require gold obtained with real money.  Then you can choose to spawn in the world or you can spawn inside a safezone.  You start off with a knife and a box, which you can turn in inside a designated safe zone or outpost at a specific market stall's NPC. For turning in the boxes you get experience, ingame cash and/or items. These boxes can be obtained inside those outposts, they have abbreviations like WTO to WTM, which indicates where the packages is obtained and where it needs to go.  Inside the safe zone, you can turn items found or given by delivery assignments into various weapons, some 'junk' items can be exchanged into ingame currency, if you have enough of those items, if not store them in your global inventory for later.  The crafting system is simple. It's more like a turn in quest, you have item x + y + z, you can craft the 'can gun' which fires shotgun rounds.  Outside the safezones it's very likely to be shot, chopped, stabbed or clubbed to death by other players.  Istead of zombies in 'Survivor Storries' aka 'WarZ' you get to fight different kind of monsters, apparently called 'Nethers', so far I encountered two types, first one attaks you via melee attacks and teleports around, the second one uses some kind of ooze on you and teleports around, both are easily killed and drop tongues, spines, vials of blood, skin and other entrails.  After death you loose your character's experience, but you get to keep your money, most of it, but your inventory is lost, except for mission items, I don't know though, if vanity items or backpacks will be lost.  Loot is distributed by either containers or items direcly, in the case of containers you have to 'open' it and then various items appear around the said container, then you just need to pick them up.  The game currently seems to be in some stage of early developement, but the level design is seems to be quite good and fitting for a post apocalyptic game, except for the largly scaled doors and ceilings, some things make less sense like the lights of emergency vehicles and traffic lights are always on even though the power supply should be dead by now.  Performance wise I didn't have any issues. I haven't seen any warping or lagging players. The graphics don't seem up to par with other current gametitles, but seems to be in the upper range with simliar games of this genre.  Gunplay and Meleeplay is simliar to older titles (Half-Life), bullets hit targets immdiatly, fly straight lines in a fire duration dependant cone of fire.Melee weapons hit when the animation is finished and when the target is in range.  Currently I won't recommend to anyone in buying this game, either turn away forever or you wait for it to be more polished.  We'll see what they'll make with this game.",

            "review_text": "First of all it is very alike to 'Survivor Stories' aka. 'WarZ'.  The UI looks similiar. The Economy is simliar and so is the ingame market.  Pay for cash currency and ingame obtainable currency can be traded for items in a 'safe zone' in both or either currency near a global inventory market stall. You can buy consumables, backpacks, vanity items and melee weapons, after purchase they get deployed in your current character's inventory.  You start with a server list. After joining a server with max. 64 players you can choose your character's appeareance, some appearences require gold obtained with real money.  Then you can choose to spawn in the world or you can spawn inside a safezone.  You start off with a knife and a box, which you can turn in inside a designated safe zone or outpost at a specific market stall's NPC. For turning in the boxes you get experience, ingame cash and/or items. These boxes can be obtained inside those outposts, they have abbreviations like WTO to WTM, which indicates where the packages is obtained and where it needs to go.  Inside the safe zone, you can turn items found or given by delivery assignments into various weapons, some 'junk' items can be exchanged into ingame currency, if you have enough of those items, if not store them in your global inventory for later.  The crafting system is simple. It's more like a turn in quest, you have item x + y + z, you can craft the 'can gun' which fires shotgun rounds.  Outside the safezones it's very likely to be shot, chopped, stabbed or clubbed to death by other players.  Istead of zombies in 'Survivor Storries' aka 'WarZ' you get to fight different kind of monsters, apparently called 'Nethers', so far I encountered two types, first one attaks you via melee attacks and teleports around, the second one uses some kind of ooze on you and teleports around, both are easily killed and drop tongues, spines, vials of blood, skin and other entrails.  After death you loose your character's experience, but you get to keep your money, most of it, but your inventory is lost, except for mission items, I don't know though, if vanity items or backpacks will be lost.  Loot is distributed by either containers or items direcly, in the case of containers you have to 'open' it and then various items appear around the said container, then you just need to pick them up.  The game currently seems to be in some stage of early developement, but the level design is seems to be quite good and fitting for a post apocalyptic game, except for the largly scaled doors and ceilings, some things make less sense like the lights of emergency vehicles and traffic lights are always on even though the power supply should be dead by now.  Performance wise I didn't have any issues. I haven't seen any warping or lagging players.

            "review_text": "I've decided to completely rework my review for the current status of the game. The game I was telling everyone would be fantastic as it went on. The game I told my friends I'd rather play than DayZ. The game I bought myself, my brother, and two of my friends.  At first, everything was just fine. It was an Early Access game with little content, but good bones. The environments were often lovely to look at, even being a dirty, gray apocalypse. The engine it used certainly had potential, however it ran like garbage. To this day, with my 780ti, AMD 8350 and 16GB of RAM, the game stuggles to maintain above 30FPS in some areas. The game makes almost no effort to use the power available to it, even after an entire year of patches. The only graphic option available to make a difference is turning off shadows completely, which just makes the game look flat.  Combat has always been floaty. Melee, while having a bit of impact, is hard to determine. Will you hit the enemy in front of you, or your friend by accident? Who knows if you'll hit anything at all, despite being right in front of them. Guns are also hit or miss, literally. They also have little to know sound travel. A sniper rifle cannot be heard in the middle of a dense city only 3 streets away? Yeah, not likely. That thing would echo for blocks.  Despite the Early Access warning being completely removed from the Steam page, everything about this game is still completely buggy if not broken. Since day 1, don't use vehicles, or at the very least the motorcycles. They sort of just...slide across the environment and can barely climb over tiny obstacles, and if you try there's a 99% chance you'll just flip completely over and even die.  The Nether themselves, probably the most promising aspect of this game, aren't even well implemented. Don't get me wrong, their ideas and designs are fantastic, even terrifying, but all the promise is shattered when they see you through walls, you can't judge their range of sight or hearing at all, and 9 times out of 10 they will just instantly swarm and warp to you causing your death. I know the point was to make them terrifying and deadly, a real challenge, but there's a difference between challenge and just being completely unfair. I love a challenge, but I hate how this game offers it.  Then there's the other players. This is the most obvious case of a survival game turned into complete deathmatch I've ever seen, and it's partly the devs fault. They continued to add things that encouraged kill on sight rather than encouraged teamwork. How loot spawns, how XP works, and then...territory claiming? Really? Did we need the game itself to encourage that? In games like DayZ, claiming a piece of land was implied. If a player set themselves up there, it was up to them to protect it. They didn't need extra XP or in game cash as incentive.   If this game was still labeled as Early Access, I'd still be able to forgive most of this since it had an actual chance of being fixed, but now since I can't find any evidence that it's still being developed and there's no warning that it's still not finished, I can't help but feel now they're just trying to trick unknowing gamers out of their cash and run.",

It simply seems broke to me right now. I'll be playing more, though, so I'll update my review if I find anything else about it worth sharing. Oh, also, horribly optimized. With all settings on max I only get around 45-50 FPS and quite a bit of framerate drops.

I got this game a very long time ago, I was highly anticipating everything this game would someday be, I was just super excited to play hundreds of hours on it. This game does do it's job pretty well, you can run around in this giant world from safezone to safezone hiding from players or the 'Nether.' The Nether are these really terrifying creatures that can teleport. They aren't friendly -_-. The nether can't go into the safezones but every so often the machines keeping the Nether out (in the safezones) will go out, letting the nether in. At this point there is also PVP in the safezones, which you can't usually do.. Player's now have two options:  Option number one: Come together and fight off Nether, fix these machines and not get eaten alive.  OR  Option number two: Fight each other to the death in the safezones, taking one anothers stuff and fix the machines yourself!  Both have a pretty good reward. When you fix the machines everyone in the broken safezone gets a butt load of XP. So by now your probably thinking that this game is pretty good! If I was reading this review that's what I would think, but notice my review is in the 'Negative Review's' section... here is why: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  This game has been %100 abandoned by it's devolpers, they took the money and they ran. This game has tons of bugs and nobody around to fix them, they do not care about this game and they are not coming back! I suppose someday somone can buy this game and fix it up, because it truly would be amazing. But with the devolpers that this game has it will never get finished and will always be a steaming pile of ♥♥♥♥  3/10 DON'T BUY THIS DISAPPOINTMENT OF A GAME (if you do you will be directly supporting these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ devolopers.",

The loot was challenging to get, You constantly felt the need to just crouch down the endless streets until you found a safe haven.

You can no longer survive alone anymore. You either group up and mindless kill everything and look for supplies or you go alone and die every 4 seconds. The game used to be focused on survival but now it is just constant PvP. This game could have been something great. It is a shame that I cant even dare to leave a safe haven.",

Then you can also jump into the PVP servers if you got bored of fighting Nether. Theres quite a few glitches and bugs but if you ignore all that and just enjoy yourself on the main parts of the game which are surviving, looting etc you could enjoy this game more than what people are saying. Also I've not payed a penny extra into the game besides buying it and I've still had a ton of fun. You don't have to buy loads of currency and things to enjoy the game.  TLDR: Decent game with nice features, can have a lot of fun but it's quite buggy and money grabbing.

And of course you lose your dignity in front of your family for crying out loud 'NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO' and then slowly weeping like a sad little girl.  Things you WILL DIE from:  &gt; YOU - you will kill yourself more often than not.  &gt; Nether - you will DIE when they swarm you.  &gt; Other Survivors - They will KILL YOU for what they think you may have.  &gt; The Developers - 'unintentional' but a fire escape landing at 12 stories that has not had its physics enabled is a DEATH TRAP and you will DIE.  &gt; Friends - They will at some point KILL YOU maybe by Friendly Fire or maybe because they are not your friend?.  &gt; YOU - I think I cannot stress this enough, I have killed myself more times trying to leap to other buildings while not having a glider in my backpack.  Note: in Single-play you will not have to worry about friends or survivors.  Bugs: There are quite a few but as Nether was in Beta and still is so, I expected that and I have not found a game breaking bug as yet.  The game over all:  I am told the game engine is Unreal 3, however it reminds me more of a Unity Build graphic wise, simular to Beasts of Prey (Bop)  &gt; In game entities are good and makes the post-apocalyptic very real.  &gt; Map is quite large and well laid out.  &gt; The textures are reasonable.  &gt; Enemy AI - When you first start, these guys are SCARY and unpredictable, and of course then you DIE, see 'slowly weeping' above.  Game Play:  &gt; Perk System - works well.  &gt; Clan System - I am of course in the STALKER Clan :D  &gt; Open world - do what you want when you want to.  &gt; No story to follow as such, which I like.  &gt; Escort missions are available (more than likely you will DIE).  &gt; Transportation of goods missions are available.  &gt; Killing a nasty kind of Nether missions are available (more than likely you will DIE some more).  &gt; Defending missions - the Safe Zone (yeah you will DIE).  &gt; Searching for everything - Not a mission but necessary to survival, no food guess what :) YOU DIE!  &gt; Loot Drops - not a mission but provides some great free stuff (yep DEAD AGAIN if you're not careful)  &gt; Hunting other players - not a mission but provides an income (you may DIE or not).  OVERALL:   I enjoy this game!  There is no grinding or running all over the map to get things done, day in and day out. No daily missions you have to do. So just take your concrete pill and harden the XXXX UP! Just get in game kill or be killed! Or survive until you DIE.

Literally, they teleport behind you so you basically walk backwards the entire time while fighting a horde. How did the game get such high ratings is beyond me. The game is an unorganized mess. The towns are empty and filled with no AI at all. The shops are just scattered in the towns btw, and the towns can also be taken over by the Nether, which is a cool idea, but they get taken over every 5 min or so when I am online for about 30 mins or so before I end up dying by an endless spawning horde of zombies. There aren't a lot of weapon choice/customizations. It's a pretty straight forward game if that's what you want. You buy the game, you play a survival game and ONLY a survival game. Not much story or anything to it.   In my book this game would be a 3/10. I do like survival games however this game was just so unorganized especially the shops in the towns. If you're a new player you will get lost in the towns.

Or at least, you'd like to, because storage and trading is only available in safezones, which forces you through a killzone of camping Clantagwearers.  This at least ruins the game for me, because it forces non-organized players to serve as a target for someones kids.  The game itself doesnt promote any cooperative gameplay, it rather punishes being nice, which leads back to the counterstrike analogy: its a deathmatch with some zeds.",

First, the update deleted my old inventory which sucked since I was filming the game and had a huge stockpile. Another issue that came from this is now there are very few servers which causes them to be too crouded. Now on a possitve note, the world has gotten bigger and there are more interesting ways to kill creatures. It rarely crashes and is much easier to play than Day-Z control wise.

            "review_text": "Nether dosen't look like much, yet I encountered significant lag and stuttering during gameplay, and the initial server browser that serves as the game's main menu consistently freezes for almost five minutes for no apparent reason. So, anytime I want to play or quit the game, I have to wait an extra five minutes for the stupid browser to finish whatever it's doing.  The game itself isn't worth this much trouble. There is nothing in the game world but players, traders, and monsters. Nothing about it feels alive. The monsters themselves are standard MMO stupid, walking back and forth endlessly as they await the next player to come along. Most monsters will teleport as soon as they see you, and will then reappear somewhere aroudn you. Initially it seemed then that it was impossible to not be hit at least once by every monster, but in practice it's possible to avoid damage so long as you keep your eyes and ears open. It's still annoying, though, and bigger monsters that don't teleport will happily come out of nowhere to assist thier smaller allies.   Problems arise whenever you try to get past a large group of enemies or even engage in combat. There is a stealth system, but it's not reliable, as the range of sight for the monsters seems to vary. In combat, lag can lead you clicking the mouse and seeing no response as a monster slowly chips down your health. This is a big problem, as you will loose everything on death. Guns make things slightly easier, as there seems to be no way to miss an enemy so long as you aim in the right direction. However, gunshots attract all nearby enemies, severly reducing the value of most guns.  On top of it all, there are the other players. It's possible to avoid others on servers with 20 players or less, and it's totally valid to play on your own. However, when deaths do happen at the hands of other players, they can be far more frustrating than any monster encounter. My first death came at the hands of a player with a rifle; I had only just seen him when shots rang out. Bang, game over. So, on top of the lag and everything else, there are player hunters with weapons that can kill you in a mere few hits.  It would be easy to dismiss all of this, if there weren't a leveling system. It would be all too easy to get to level 11 or 12, then get killed and have to start all over agian. Over and over agian. And that, on top of the lag and possibility of near instant death, make this no fun.",

I have done everything possible to get this garbage going and nothing works. If your wondering about my comp... I play Bf4 on Ultra.  UPPDATE...  I got it to go took 7min of just waiting on the server screen not doing anything else. Now that Ive played the game Id rate it about a 4/10  Game mechanics - 4/10 Broken - zombies can teleport. So you die somewhere... all your ♥♥♥♥ is in a pile at a zombies feet. To pick something up takes almost 1sec. So you hope to pick up your old gun. but nope you get something else. So you run... but the zombie can teleport and 1 shots you. you respawn no where near your old bodies... you buy a gun with either REAL money or in game cash... waste money get a gun but no good equipment go back to your bodies... Shoot at the zombie but he teleports... Uh oh where is he behind you and bam! you die again... So you now have 3 bodies all in one spot.  The Biggest upset is that when you Die which you will ALOT.. your exp is Reset to 0.... you keep most of your money BUT if you got a backpack for money.. thats dropped too. No way of respawning with any of your old loot.  Another thing is experience players hunt noobs for fun. Or pay to win people.  Game Feel 4/10 or less. They Rave that the games guns work like Battlefield??? WTF really? BF1? because they do not in any way feel like BF4. its more like counterstrike 1. Running dosnt feel real. It dosnt look or feel like DayZ at all. So they Promise DayZ and BF4... This game is Counterstrike 1 but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly unfair. Infestation Survivors ALL over again...  Please give me my money back!! Update... PLEASE GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK!",

            "review_text": "Overall, this is a fantastic game, certainly better than the average survival game on steam. The world is immersive, the 'nethers' feel like they're living things that want to survive just as much as you do, they just happen to see you as food. On the other hand, this doesn't take away from the fear, nethers are definitely creatures to be feared, ESPECIALLY the larger ones. Take STALKER and combine it with DAYZ and you get this.  Now onto some less positive things.  First off, I don't get what people mean by microtransactions in this game, I've simply not seen them (granted I only have 4 hours logged, but I did a lot in that time). Judging from other reviews, microtransactions existed in the past but were removed, same goes for most issues people complain about. But this game is by no means perfect.  In the time I've played this game, I've experienced crashes fairly often (when taking screenshots primarily) which the devs claim to be working on, but they've been saying that since 2014 from what I see, so it might take a bit. I've also seen glitchy hitboxes, ranging from slightly hovering over the ground to whole structures with no colision at all, that you can comically just walk straight through. Finally, as much as this isn't a personal concern for me, I know it is for a lot of other people: graphics. The visuals are decent, the lighting is really nice and what graphical quality the game does have is well used in enhancing the atmosphere, but there are moments that make you notice how old the game looks. If graphics are a concern for you, I recommend looking at some youtube gameplay, really I recommend this for many games but this one especially.  Overall, dispite its flaws, I highly recommend this game and I hope the devs keep up the good work!",

The other special types generall can two/three hit you and are relentless, even with upgraded stamina they will chase you forever constantly teleporting in front of you while you need to take around 15 swings to kill them.   On top of all this, again, it's typical DayZ/survival ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. The game runs poorly as usual, the community is all a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥s who KoS, and thanks to how the world design is structured you will spend a lot of time looting the same places over and over.

When you spawn in with only a knife to defend yourself, you are very vunreable. Sneak past the Nether creatures and other survivors to reach the safe zones around the incredibley designed map. Once you character beings to level up and begins to grow their inventory of loot, roaming around because a huge risk - where every encounter becomes more intense than the last. Do you hide from the enemy to avoid confrontation - Do you run away or attack and risk all you have earned. Dying means you lose EVERYTHING so the choices you make are CRUTIAL.  What an incredible game - highly recommend, on or off sale!  GOOD S**T: - Unique game - Great weapon and gun play - Intresting enemies - Incredible level design - Tense enviroment - Survival game with objectives (Big bonus in my book) - Servers still populated  SOME BAD STUFF: - Poor optimisation - Infrequent bugs and crashes  I see some comments about spawn kills - I didn't ever get spawn killed I see some comments about hackers - I didn't see any hackers either Maybe I missed some of the bad stuff  I love high risk games like Nether - when your character dies, that's it!

Being dropped into the city, with plenty of options for cover sure takes the frustrations out that earn other games the moniker 'Marathon Simulators' forcing you to run for 15 mins to get to a town. I'm looking at you DayZ and Infestation. Second, safe-zones can give you a goal and a fresh breath of air, but other games don't keep you on your toes while giving you a chance at the same time. A safe-zone can come under attack, you have the option to stand and fight or run from the ensuing chaos. And if you choose to run, a time limited protection mechanic lets you safely get to cover and avoid the wide open sniper areas that got me killed a lot in infestation:Survivor stories.

            "review_text": "I'll start by stating this is my first review and I will be focusing on different sections of the game.  Graphics/Atmosphere/Audio - The game has very nice graphics and plenty of smoke, fires, fog, and a night day system help pull you into the game. The game also has a nice sound selection that makes you feel like a survivor.  Servers/Connectibility/Ease of Use- The game has plenty of servers, however the loading screen takes a very long time and almost any action during this loading causes a crash. Many times the game will crash for no explainable reason before or during the server loading session. Once in the game the connectivity is rather strong with no noticible lag spikes. The game has many random crashes during loading and playing. However, once in the game you should be safe from crashes.  Gameplay - The game plays at a moderate level. The weapon play is pretty weak. Melee weapons will often not register hits and guns can hit or miss for no reason. The actual Nether in the game are almost no threat. You can walk for hours without seeing one. Most can be easily killed with the first knife after getting some skill and all can be outrun if going in a straight line. Food, to survive, is almost worthless. Either you survive long enough to buy it or you die before your hunger runs out. The latter is the most common.  PVP- OUT OF CONTROL. Many say that because this is a survival game that everyone KOSing is almost mandatory. I beg to differ. Survival does not mean TDM, but that is what this is. There is a huge gap between players. The very experienced and well equipped and then the noobs. As a new player you will be hunted down and killed at all times by all players, except clan mates, even if you have nothing to loot. Just respawned? Shot anyways. I was killed over and over by a group of four with assault rifles while I only had my chef's knife.   Overall, unless you are willing to suffer the neverending PKing you should not get this game. However, if you enjoy more of a TDM game with a sprinkle of survival, get it.",

The fun of the game is playing with friends and ganging up on other people or joining up to take down a Reaper. If you're planning on buying this game, know that you're going to get into a fairly difficult survival world. If you're up for challenges and enjoy harder games, play this.

I enjoy playing games that u need to be careful and hidden. Eventhough it takes hours its fun that one mistake can do so much. If somone runs then there is a chance of being sniped but at the same time camping the same place is not worth it because someone can back stab you.   It is a fun game and i recommend people to play and give it a try. MEANING USING KEYS!!!! from friends then deciding to play or not.   TRUTH IS ITS WAYYY BETTER PLAYING WITH FRIENDS THAN ALONE. It takes hours walking from one place to another because of the insane map but with friends everything becomes more fun because you are not serious and in Nether and all other games its about having fun and playing.

First off yes this game isnt perfect by no means, it does have some bugs that hopefully the devs will work out. Most the reviews about it not working and being stuck in free roam mode was because the servers wernt ready to handle all the people that got it on steam sale. They seem to be up and running now, iv played 20 hours last 3 days just fine. That being said dont go into this game thinking its gonna be a better dayz, This game is much easyer(even tho iv seen more rage and crying in chat then dayz)Dieing doesnt mean much cause its super easy to just gear back up and the smaller map makes for faster and more often pvp. combat is like your classic fps and i really like the change from zombies , the nether can actually kill you pretty fast if you get swarmed.I also really like the lvling system tho some people dont like that when you die you go back to lvl 1 , but just like gearing back up lvling is easy and fast . Run a few packages kill a few nether and your back up again. The only big issues i have with the game is the server loading screen bug , when you first launch the game you need to take your hands off the key board and mouse and just walk off and let it set for about 40 secs-to a min and then your good to go also the game needs a lil more survival elements , would like to see eating and drinking split into two diffrent needs and would like to see base building in the future when the map gets bigger. All in all nether is a fun lil shooter with some lite survival elements and its worth the $3 to me But it wont be topping Dayz any time soon( Im speaking from 2 years dayz mod exp, havent bought the stand alone yet) !",

(IMPORTANT!- you WILL die a lot and you WILL lose all of your hard work, items and lvls when killed -items can be stored in the global invetory in safe zones- so be prepared and hopefully grow a thick skin since dying is an annoying inevitable fact that happens in Nether. Also if you are being camped by a SZ camper just disconnect from the server and reconnect and you'll spawn at a random location.) the game is more enjoyable with friends or a people you deem trustworthy and this game can be a lot of fun with great potential in the future.

Even though they are marketing it as a 'stable release', it feels like I'm playing a game that has never left the alpha stage of development. You sit and watch your character hopelessly glitch and twitch through an annoyingly large landscape with long expanses of nothingness except for the noises of yourself russling through the bushes alone; Minecraft lends itself to be more suspenseful than this. And at least in Minecraft you feel the satisfaction of striking iron ore once every four minutes. Whereas I'll spend half-an-hour meandering around and scrounging piles of garbage without receiving any reward for my time spent. The factor that intrigued me most about the game has become the factor I loath most about the game. It was pitched as an MMO where you bump into new players, and then have an intense moment to decide whether to fight, go your separate ways, or attempt to build alliances and hope your trust is true. Yet, without microphone capability there is no time/way to explain your hopes/intentions/truces, so the game becomes more of a PvP shoot-em-up-free-for-all-deathmatch-thing. Sure, there are the occasional 'Nether' (the NPC bad guys) scattered about, but they are the least of your worries in this game. THERE IS NO ONE YOU CAN TRUST IN THIS GAME, SHOOT EVERYTHING THAT MOVES. Permadeath is a fun idea, until you watch 4 hours of your work go down the drain on a regular basis. The game throws level 1's with level 30's and expects things to go smoothly. But I built my character up to level 12 only to watch him get insta-killed by a bully level 30.

There really isn't much you can do besides loot, bring boxes to people, and capture different regions (sounds more like gang wars to me). It is alot like dayz (or tries to be) where it has no point. But at least dayz has decent gun fights, player interactions, and they are building it to where you have something to go for. Another thing is how the 'nether' are so friken OP. They do so much damgage, are fast, call their friends, and teleport! It makes it so hard to get from one place to the next. Also the safezones are camped to often. I know that they tried to fix this with an invincibility counter but it can still be gaurded by bandits. I would only reccomend this to someone who just likes to wander in games.",

The basic thing for this game is to survive as much as you can. Nethers can kill you, players can kill you, and even you can kill yourself by not eating of drinking water.  It forces you to go and explore the world and at the same time, to be careful, so its definitely not a game for a quick play, if you are expecting a fast pvp or pve it’s not that, but it’s very enjoyable when you learn that surviving it’s not just go and kill everything like a Rambo!!!

Well I am not really sure whom to blame. Possibly the developer or AMD with their crappy 14.x drivers that don't even let me run Crysis and Battlefield 3 for unknown reasons anymore. Both games are reduced to an ultra low frame lvl which already starts in the main menu. Nether is showing the exact same symptoms I get the serverlist but I have to wait for the screen reaction of my mouse for like 15 seconds which prevents me from even joining a server because I have no controll over what I am doing. It is possible that NVIDIA users are not even affected by what I am writing here.  To let you know my System Configuration:  AMD Phenom 1090T, 16 GB RAM, Sapphire R9 270 2GB OC Edition, Windows 8.1 with current Catalyst 14.6 RC2. I am also running several Linux Distros and am happily playing there while being completly unsatisfied with Windows 8.1. OpenSuse 13.1, Mint 17, Ubuntu 14.04. Where I run X-COM Enemy unknown and StarConflict, Rust, Portal, HL 2 complete, Legends of Grimrock, ETQW, Hammerwatch and Civ V just fine with one exeption in OpenSuse13.1 where it prevents X-COM from loading saves.  Maybe you should give Nether a Linux Client as well, I am sure AMD players would at least have a playable framrate.   Since I cannot really review nether here I will change my recommendation as soon as I can play. Also I would still everybody wanting to back the Game recomment to buy it.

Am i missing something?

            "review_text": "This game is pretty hit or miss. There is a very solid foundation of a good, fun game, plagued by bugs and development problems.   The bad: -Most of my problems don't occur within the game itself, rather I have problems with the launcher and server list not loading or being extremely bugging. Server stability is unreliable at best. Often times I will wonder around for 15-30 min, only to find out the server has been 'frozen' the entire time and nothing I've done has counted. There are days I have to try 4 or 5 servers before I can get properly connected.  -Additionally, I'm a little concerned that the developers seem too focused on content instead of optimization. The game is very beautiful at times, but I too often encounter strange textures, floating grass, and other oddities. I would also like to see more graphics options in the pause menu. Currently you have to edit video settings from the config file. Finally, I have had trouble with key bindings and the way items stack in your inventory is not intuitive and makes it hard to manage your items. -There definitely is a learning curve. At the beginning, you while probably die and lose some good loot several times. But there is a leveling system that persists through death, and your cumulative experience will make each fresh start easier. At first, deaths were frustrating but the more you play the more you will realize Its not too hard to come back. -Hitbox detection ranges from the absolute best to the absolute worse I've ever seen. Using a gun is more or less a crap shoot, but finding a server that works well for you can partially resolve this.   The good: -Damn this game is atmospheric. There are times when I am sitting at the top of a building at night tracking 2 player in my scope and I all I can think about how exciting this game is.  -There is tons of area to explore (even if much of it is empty wasteland) and there are plenty of little areas you can examine and get a little blurb like 'I ate at this cafe once'. There aren't a whole lot of them but I'm hopeful this will expand in the future to help you better figure out the back story of this game (side note, the story is somewhere between nonexistent and meh at this point).  -Though lots of people complain about it being impossible to face more experienced players, I just don't think its true. The game is well balanced enough you can fight low-level nethers as a beginner. Most of this game is learning what areas to loot and what areas/nethers to avoid. Most of the time I'm able to craft a high-tier guns with just an hour or two of scavenging. Also I've been able to go from start to the highest level without a gun more than once. -There's no grand strategy or overarching objectives. So the game is what you want it to be. You can spending your time carrying cardboard boxes across the map for a cash reward, or trying to make a shotgun out of dismembered zombie flesh. There's not a huge variety of things to do, I think the fact that different players are trying to accomplish different goals makes encounters interesting. You have to decide if you are going to be the kind of person that shoots on sight or try to cooperate. (side note, i'd say about half the people I meet will just shoot on sight. There have been plenty of times I've run into friendly players who want to team up or trade)  Final verdict: 6.5/10 I do love this game, but because of shaky development and mixed community response you should probably pick it up at a good sale price.",

All of which look fantastic on screen! The dynamic day and night cycle is also great!   On the other hand the game basically consists of spawning, running around the map for hours desperately fending of hordes of creatures with a kitchen knife desperately hoping to loot a firearm. 5 hours later, when you find a gun, you get shot in the back by another player and start again with the kitchen knife.  The content is pretty much ended there. No real quests. No real storyline. Hence: unfinished - a BETA at best.   Has the potential to be a very enjoyable game, and again it looks amazing when playing! But definitely no where near a full release. Based on the fact that they no longer claim it to be in Beta or early-access I have to say no to a recommendation. If it was labelled a Beta then it would definitely get a yes. But I can't help feel it is just a lie to say it isn't.",

The truth about this game is that you start off really weak with 2 different levels; A player level: which restarts at 1 if your character dies, and an account level: which is constant and lends smaller boons (benefits) to every character made by the account. This game is worth a try in my opinion. It may offer more in later hours of a playthrough but we'll see just how bad it gets. I recommend this game.",

It's faster paced, allies are few, but jump around for a while, and you can have a blast. Tribes can create some team work, and fending off a massive nether group chasing you until the ends of the earth can build bonds quickly.  For $15, I would give this a shot.

Nether is a Post Apocalptic Mmo with breath taking visual's of Chicago and real life Locations  For me,I live in Illinois so I know most of the landmarks in the area. Which makes me really want to explore the land.   The greyed out Areas you cant explore yet but they are being worked on as we speak.  Now about the real deal  The game has fair combat with a nice touch of visual on it which really makes it stand out 8/10  The Graphics,I play on low (I have a windows 8 x64) Are fair,But they are with a bit of lag. So if your computer is a complete potato, I highly reccomend you upgrade. 7/10  This is a high PVP game,So if people snipe you out of nowhere don't get mad. Thats only just the first step of the game! I havn't got killed by a player yet and or killed someone but it can happen at any time. Its a Apocalptic world ya' know. 9/10  Skill trees are allright but I can't speak on behalf of them,so If you wanted a more detailed look go look on Google. 9/10  The Game is still in its Early stages and is playable,Ignore the people who say its BUGGY. Of course it is it is a Alpha (Correct me if im wrong.) Game. Not very buggy as I played it. Maybe I havn't explored it enough. 10/10  Overall,If your a enthusiest of any Survival games (You have a food and health meter aswell) A fan of DAY-Z or WAR-Z Then you need to buy this game right now.  Ignore the other people with the bad and rude comments,This game is Semi-Social,I play by myself but the teaming is great.  Go buy this game right now while its on sale!

I was hesitant to get the game at all with so many negative reviews not just on steam but everywhere, but I figured $3 was low enough for me to risk it.   It took mutliple attempts to link to steam (which is required to play) and the server lists kept freezing on me. When I finaly got in a server i was put in a sort of spectator mode where I could't do anything and had to use task manager to close the game. After about an hour of these sorts of issues I was finally able to get in the game. I spawned in a 'Safe zone' only to find out that it was under attack. I had to fin 6 anti-nether stations in order to make the safe zone safe again, while getting attacked by low to high level enemies and some players in riot gear swinging axes player killing all the new guys like me. After an 50 minutes of this (and in my opinion poor melee combat mechanics) me and the other players activated all the stations and it was really a safe zone again. There was however nothing to do in the safe zone, so I left to go explore. I found no enemies, no players, and no loot. It was a complete wasteland. While yes it was very atmospheric and lead to a sense of isolation , it very quickly became simply boring. I found nothing to do in the game and very little guidence or quests.   Later on, with some more development this could easily become a great PvE or PvP game. For PvE it needs A LOT more content, and for PvP they need to rebalance it so new players have a chance and aren't discouraged and stop playing. I may or may not return to this game anytime soon, but maybe if they add more to the game my opinion of it will change. On sale for $5 or less I would say why not get the game, you may like it you may not. But at full price I am sad to say that I cannot recommend this game to anyone",

(spectatored for 5mins before my first spawn) - the game will show you two buttons once you are dead. If you click the left button quickly, you will be back to the frozen server list again. (The death msg is like a Yes/NO msg box, therefore I miss-clicked the left button twice. It takes me 10+ mins to re-enter and respawn) - after played for 1hrs, my friend and I suddenly disconnected from the server without any alert and the game were frozen.

Because you will realize that DayZ is awesome, and you can stop looking for something better. It takes 5 - 10 minutes to load the server list, (which is by-the-way the first screen when the game opens) and in that time the game will seem like it has stopped responding. It took me 20 minutes to figure out that ITS NOT FROZEN! Its just loading every server available in the world, yep, there is no filter options for the server list. So it will load all of em... In the world... Which is acceptable, because this is in 'beta'. But after playing for about a half hour, and after it crashed on me, and I had to restart the stunningly long process of loading the server list, then playing for a bit longer, I came to the conclusion that this game has an unacceptable amout of aggrivating glitches and bugs. So... I quit the game and went to the main menu, (The main menu is the server list) So I could select the EXIT button and GTFO. BUT, I had to wait for the server list to load...

For some reason, recently, I was unable to actually play the game and was stuck in spectator mode, flying freely around the map. Then, a minute ago, I open the game and notice that it works just fine. So I'm going to assume that it will continue to switch to spectator mode every so often and revert back to normal, although this hasn't been a problem till recently. When the game works, it is quite fun.   I always have a sense of unease while playing PvP, for fear not of monsters, but of players.  Probably because most of them are hackers who have a 'Shoot-on-site' mindset and will not hesitate to one shot you if they see you.   PvE is a much different experience, since it adds an element of cooperation between players, but also makes the game much easier since the Nethers aren't too difficult to evade. PvE also removes the threat of hackers, since they cannot harm you in PvE.  If you want a challenging PvP survival experience that comes with hackers (free of charge!) then I certanly recommend this game. If you are looking for a cooperative, PvE survival experience with little challenge (if you know what you're doing), I also recommend this game. But be warned, hackers are an issue in PvP, and the development team seems to have dropped off the planet, so it's unlikely this will be fixed soon, if ever.  Overall: The development team should be more active, and should be more diligent with anti-cheat. But it looks unlikely they will be back soon, if ever.  For what it is in its current (and probably permanant) state, I like the game a lot, despite it's flaws.  7/10",

Plus this game is more fast past its not soo realistic that you have to stop for 2 mins and bandege your self and you dont have to exchange blood. Plus this game has good mission that gives you moneys,suplies,exp and this game you have levels and perks you can use and you also get bonus for surviveing longer.

If i had to match this game to another i would say metro 2033 and the movie the road.",

When Nether's hit detection is spot on as well as no other glitches running (running through buildings or hiding inside mounds) this game is insanely awesome and offers a pvp environment that literally has you off your seat in pure fear and anticipation. This game was initially built to be a survival pvp game and i think at the beginning they definitely grasped that dream, but since then and with all the new things they are putting in the game the team has put off ironing out the bugs with the game since it was in beta. It makes me sad because i've both logged a lot of play-time on this game and had many ridiculously fun fights ranging from butter knife duels to full on team massacres. Being a high profile player for many months on this game i'm sad to see it in it's current condition and if the dev's choose to revert back to their initial ideals i would be happy to return, but for now it seems i am disinterested.",

The game has two big problems that I've found in the first 2 hours. The first is lots of graphical bugs, with floating furniture, or in some places furniture you can walk through and in other places furniture you can't come close to. Water tends to screw up your movement, it's crazy. The second is lack of players. There doesn't seem to be many online at all, and it's saturday. Since the map is huge, this means it can be pretty difficult to actually run into other people.   Still, I'm going to keep playing this. Hopefully, the bugs get ironed out in future updates.",

To lose everything creates no progression, makes it terribly grindy, and gets boring very quickly. Also, when you know you'll just lose all progress and your players are less likely to play regularly and get attached. Imagine if losing in Pokemon to an elite and you lost every pokemon in your inventory. They'd make A LOT more money and loyal frequent players by at LEAST making a server that allows losing 2 lvls on death instead of all.   First off, they never mentioned it was 64 bit only so I couldn't even play it for the longest time. I was excited once I built a new computer. When I told all my friends I can play Nether now and their first response was,  'Oh, did it stop sucking?'   I wasn't sure what they meant until I played the game. There's a reason there are only about 5 people on all servers combined that play now. And it's a rather simple thing, get rid of perma-death. For every 30 people in the forums that hate it and 1 likes it. The game will kill itself with this feature. No one cried in Everquest when they got RID of perma-death. I'm all for penalties but when I can't progress past lvl 3 because of being overrun or sniped and it becomes horrible grindy. MMO's might be grindy but at least have some progression to offset it. Lose gear on death, or lose 2 lvls each death. But to go through the trouble of leveling up high to be dropped to lvl 1 with nothing isn't any good.   It encourages people to just run around at lvl 1, try to kill a lvl 8 player and take all their stuff. Because when you know you will always, eventually, be lvl 1 anyway and you have no attachment to the game. At least with Rust and there's more to do and faster progress. Building. Etc. Even if you lose everything in rust and you usually have your home to go back to. Don't bother making a lvl system when you can easily get overrun by a 'purge' or campers. Every game that got rid of perma death experience a surge in activity and profit, guess Nether won't learn until exactly 0 players are playing.",
