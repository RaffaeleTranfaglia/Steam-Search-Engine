            "review_text": "Videoball... Sorry, I need to clear my throat for this one...  VIDEOBALL is an air hockey-Asteroids-Crossfire(the board game) mashup sports game where you shoot projectiles at the ball(s) and can use them to stun other players (including your teammates). Games can be 1v1, 2v2, or 3v3 if you're feeling up for one VIDEOBALL match you'll never forget. The controls remind me of Asteroids except more floaty, but they're fine. I also appreciate the intuitiveness for just using the control stick and any one button to navigate though menus, though it can get somewhat confusing at times. It's not a horrible thing though. If you're a shut-in like me, you'll be glad that there's AIs, each with their own behaviors. You could have an AI for scoring, an AI for defending, and you, for.. Whatever you want to do, I guess. Even with the large amount of customization available in exhibition matches, there's also an arcade mode where you (and a friend (assuming you have any after kicking their ♥♥♥ in VIDEOBALL)) can play against predetermined AIs in several different arenas. There's also an online mode which I h̶a̶v̶e̶n̶'̶t̶ ̶t̶r̶i̶e̶d̶ ̶y̶e̶t̶ ̶(̶w̶i̶l̶l̶ ̶u̶p̶d̶a̶t̶e̶ ̶t̶h̶i̶s̶ ̶r̶e̶v̶i̶e̶w̶ ̶w̶h̶e̶n̶ ̶I̶ ̶a̶c̶t̶u̶a̶l̶l̶y̶ ̶f̶i̶n̶d̶ ̶s̶o̶m̶e̶o̶n̶e̶)̶.̶ tried and it's actually better than I expected with all the stuff that can be onscreen. Sure, there were a few hiccups here and there, but I played a 3v3 with little to no lag and that's awesome.  So yeah, that's pretty much Video- VIDEOBALL. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go relax my throat again... After one more game of VIDEOBALL.  Now my throat is dead. Meh.",

            "review_text": "First of all watch the trailer. If you like what you see, now imagine that the experience is 1000th times funnier with a pad in hands.  There is a great Rocket League feeling in this game, you have fun immediatly, and after a while you start to see all the possible tactics and the progression curve that makes this kind of games even greater, with huge momentum, intense suspense, offensive and defensive combinations, etc..  Lots of different arenas, cool music, lots of game mods, this is a huge pile of fun over there.  We need to be millions playing this game, so we'll always have fun. Videoball is damn fun.  I said ''fun'' a lot of times. Come and have fun with us. It will for sure be funny.  10/10 would have fun again.",
