Still to this day we are gifted with excellent mods for it, currently Caustic Creative are developing a wonderful overhaul mod named Deus Ex: Revision (be sure to check it out!).  This was one of my first childhood games, I can still remember certain stealth patterns to the levels. Really good to revisit from time to time and like I mentioned, mods really revitalise an old classic. JC Denton the badass! The question is, which ending did you choose?  For those wondering, the storyline of the Deus Ex series is as follows;  2027 – Human Revolution 2029 – Mankind Divided 2052 – Deus Ex 2072 – Invisible War  So the events of the original come AFTER the events of Human Revolution.",

Deus Ex: Game of the Year Edition is a masterpiece. If you didn't play it yet - you definetly should. An exceptional mix of FPS / RPG / Stealth / Adventure. Took me 62 hours to get the whole 3 endings and still didn't get enough of it.  You get to play as UNATCO (United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition) agent J.C. Denton. Not a simple agent, but an augmented bionic man. Find out betrayal, carefully choose who your friends and enemies are and, finally, decide the fate of the world.  The game gives you freedom in everything. You don't get a Game Over except you get killed, throw yourself from a building, drink booze or do drugs till you overdose, or smoke cigarettes till you get cancer. Overwise it doesn't care what path you choose as long as you can survive the consequences. And there are choices to be made every instance. Use lockpicks to open a door or find a key for it, look for computer login info or use your computer skills to hack it, find acces codes for door keypads or use multitools to disable them, jump on your enemies and slaughter them the way you like it, or look for alternative ways, tunnels, air ventilation systems, etc, and avoid unnecessary kills. It's very rewarding also. A lot of augumentations to choose from, a big variety of weapons, ammo, tools, enemies, locations, etc, which will increasingly keep you interested in going through this cyberpunk conspiracy story.  Proclaim yourself God, be part of The Illuminati, or plunge the world into another Dark Age. The choice is yours.",

            "review_text": "Pretty much objectively one of the best games of all time. Nearly every aspect of this game has aged very well. The plot is engaging and intelligent. The gameplay allows you to approach nearly any situation in nearly any way you wish and the levels are so damn big and well designed that you will often find all sorts of alternate ways to do things each time you play.   For that matter there are so many little things and side missions you can find in the game that it is almost always worth exploring everywhere that you can. Not to mention that the game WILL reward you for exploring.   Building a character is so much fun and there are so many things that you can specialize in and it will change the way you play the game in very significant ways.   The story is very malleable and you can pretty much do anything you want and rather then giving you a 'MISSION FAILED' thing when you kill a story important character the game will mold to your actions.   The Music is awesome and really captures the atmosphere of the game.  Pretty much the only two things I could imagine somebody objecting to would be the graphics and voice acting. Which sure, I mean the graphics ARE pretty ugly but if such an old game having bad graphics bothers you so much then you can easily download some graphics mods to make the game much more paletable for you. (As a side note this game has a pretty decent modding community you should check out.)  And while the voice acting can be pretty bad it (thankfully) is the funny kind of bad so you shouldnt be bothered too much by it.",

Whilst the game hasn't aged well visually, and the voice acting is terrible, the amount of freedom afforded to the player to make decisions is still impressive. The feeling of reactivity and decision on the player is quite exhilerating, especially as the game goes on and decisions have further reaching impact.  The opening can feel clumsy, but as you realise how immersive the level of reaction can be, and the opportunities you have to make meaningful decisions, the game really comes to life. The endings lack a little impact due to how they are presented, but the journey to making those decisions is worth the investment, the game is a true classic. It's a shame most games since have focused more on narrative and mechanics as separate elements, rather than blending decisions into meaningful influences on the game (as an aside, I think the closest to achieve this other than Deus Ex is Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines).  Whilst Deus Ex: Human Revolution never lived up to the freedom and openness and impact that the original set in place, the two slot together beautfully lore-wise, so if you've played one and not the other, I'd highly recommend them both.",

You might not immediately warm up to it, but you'll quickly learn to love what has been created here. Deus Ex is a meaty as hell game, and one of the indisputed kings of Player Agency.

Yes, it looks ugly - no doubt about that - and it does have some truly awful shooting mechanics, but once you get into it - you'll love it.",

One day soon I'll play some fan missions, maybe. Also this doesn't count the hours I've played on disk which too is a lot and I don't leave the game on without playing it, well purposely anyway.  This is my fave game of all time and has been since younger childhood. The first time playing through this was the best experience in any game ever. Absolutely mind-blowing. I just wish I could reexperience playing it for the first time because by now I've played over 300 hours on it (including my disk). This and the Thief series are the most magical games to have a first playthrough of ever. This game has a lot of flaws that also add to its charm, so instead of the normal Pro's and Con's, I'm going to have a Charmy Flaw list as well.  Pros: +Great sound design +One of the most beautiful soundtracks in anything ever +Incredible writing and story +Great UI +Sick weapons (OP Dragon's Tooth Sword) +Characters (also a con...I'll get to that) +Heaps of interesting locations +Sub-plots and mini storylines +Optional sidequests are great +Non-linear, multiplayer outcomes, ways of doing things +Five playthroughs worth of stuff to find and then some (not exaggerating) +Perfect length (took me 22 hours first playthrough) +Multiplayer ways of playing, lethal, non-lethal, stealth, all-out, no augs etc. +Great dialogue system +Upgradeable skills +Maximum replayability +A really good roleplaying multiplayer (if you want it to be) that no one has ever cared about ever +Shadow, stealth system, Thief like but not invisible +Have to mention UI again, I mean, it's REALLY good +Feels like a real world ('Who will help the widow's son?', 'Excuse me?', 'Oh sorry, I thought you were someone else.') +Nice plotwist early on +Every character you meet is memorable, every one. That dude shouting holy stuff at Battery Park. That rude newspaper girl in Hong Kong. That annoying boy who's annoying to the rude girl in Hong Kong. That ♥♥♥♥ who keeps asking you stuff in Kell's Kitchen (Used Car Salesman?). Those two lesbians in the club in Hong Kong etc. +The best bossfights in any game ever +Will update review in the future  Cons: -Some weapons are useless or pointless (PS20, Stealth Pistol etc.) -Most augmentations are useless/pointless (only helpful ones are speed, health recover, strength and that's about it. You can go through the whole game without them if you really want) -Difficulty gets a lot harder all of a sudden at the end -Graphics look bad for 2000 -Default FOV is quite small -A lot of characters become unimportant later on or dissapear completely, pretty much everyone from the beginning -Will update review in the future  Flaws/Charms: *♥♥♥♥♥♥, almost racist voice-acting *Hearing footsteps through rooms *AI getting stuck opening doors *Will update review in the future  Sound: 9/10 Graphics: 4/10 (looked ♥♥♥♥ then, looks ♥♥♥♥ now) Gameplay: 10/10 Content/Replayability: 10/10 Overall: 10/10  Get this.

This game combines different genres (FPS, RPG, Stealth and action) into one and it was the very first piece of media that actually made me think about socio-political issues in real life. It also taught me the consequences of choice and how different choices can lead to opposite or even unexpected results. It might be a dated game by today’s standards, but this game actually respects the player by interacting with him/her through choices and liberty of gameplay to reach from point A to point B while maintaining the player grasped into the plot that is masterfully delivered and never feels unrealistic or over the top. It makes you think on the final outcome of all the choices and paths you have taken and can even make you second-guess yourself for doing it. This game teaches you that there is no right or wrong, just different ways to do things.",

You can go inside a building through the front door, or you can find a back entrance. You can hack computers, digital locks, and security consoles, but you can also get the password somewhere. You can pick locks, but you can get the key from somebody. You can kill your enemies, but you can just avoid encountering them at all.  The level designs are just brilliant. They're big, but not huge. You can easily memorize them, so it's easy not to get lost. Some of the levels are visited more than once and it feels different everytime, yet you still remember the places.  The graphics aren't amazing and they may look outdated, but they fit the atmosphere perfectly. The music is great and every location has its own soundtrack that fits to what you're currently doing.  The story is great and a little bit complex with conspiracies here and there, but there's not much to tell without spoiling it. This game is set in 2052 and it takes place in a chaotic world filled with terrorists, drugs, diseases, and augmented humans. There's a lot of memorable characters in this game, and every single one of them has their own personality. You can kill some of the important characters but instead of failing the mission, it will change the story and you will have to face the consequences.  In short, it's a great classic game with a great story and music that combines RPG, FPS, action, and stealth elements with a lot of different playstyles to choose.",
