            "review_text": "  My expectations of Radium going in were pretty lackluster. However, after playing through the first 10 or so levels of Radium, what I found is a very cool, unique take on the classic 'Navigate the level and avoid the obstacles' puzzle genre. Easily worth a dollar just to experience the clever control scheme.",
