Unfortunately, the water shielded him from the explosive barrages. Then a soldier gunned him down. I am questioning the Shogun Battleship's firepower...   But on the bright side, I had an Attack Dog that took hardly any damage from running past 3 Armageddon Tanks who were firing at him. Who let the dogs out?  Canines are invulnerable! (Then they get one-shot by infantry units)  8.5/10 Dogs &amp; Bears with Anti-Tank fur coats, and troops turning into Mermaids to avoid artillery barrages --- what more could you want?  EDIT: Of course, the enemy AI cheats by being able to launch strikes at your base without sending a sighting-unit over, which Human commanders must do (i was building a little infantry army so i can para-drop them and the Soviet AI launched a badger-bomber strike there, killing them all instantly, with NONE of their units at my base to reveal the shroud - this happens in every playthrough; beware!)...",

            "review_text": "This is, to my mind, the best Command &amp; Conquer game out there. Some complain about the blatant fanservice with respect to the use of well-edowed female actrices in the hammy videos, while others believe that Red Alert 3 has gone too far with respect to the silliness inherent in the series (i.e. the use of war bears by the Soviets and the mecha-inspired units in the army of the Empire of the Rising Sun). To me, all that stuff is simply silly fluff that shouldn't be taken seriously.   What should be taken seriously is the gameplay. The game is a refined version of the Command &amp; Conquer style of real-time strategy game: a simple economy (you build powerplants to power your structures and harvest ore to get money to buy more buildings and units) with an emphasis on the spectacle of battle. Units are fragile, so expect many of them to be destroyed more or less as soon as you encounter enemy forces. Hard counters are used, which means that some units, for example, have no defences against air units, or are weak against certain types of infantry, and so forth. This means that reconaissance is as important if not more so as in other RTS games.   Red Alert 3 is more micro-heavy than most of the other games in the series. Each and every unit has a toggable special ability (hotkey F), and use of these special abilities will prove essential in most battles. Combined with the speed at which units move and their fragile nature, this means that games can get very hectic, very fast. It's for this reason that I mostly avoid multiplayer: I know that I won't be good enough to compete anyway. Instead, I stick to singleplayer and it's loads of fun.   The game has three factions and each of them gets their own campaign, with each campaign consisting of nine missions each. The different factions are the Allies, the Soviets, and a new third faction especially developed for this game, namely the Empire of the Rising Sun (essentially Japan). The Allies emphasize their air power, while the Soviets field relatively sturdy ground troops and can spit out a lot of units. The Empire is a high-tech faction with specialized units (remember: F is your friend!) and probably the most difficult to play by newcomers. The leaders of each of these factions are played by well-known actors: Vincent Pryce, Tim Curry, and George Takei, respectively.   I've put many hours into the disc version of the game before buying it anew on Steam and do not regret a single minute that I spent playing the game. The campaign is entertaining and can also be played fully in co-op mode. If you don't have any friends, an AI will take over. The AI sometimes really helps out during missions, but more often than not simply forms a distraction that the enemy AI will occupy itself with while you build your base and reinforce your army. If the campaign is not your cup of tea, you can always play skirmishes against the computer or go online (there is a replacement out there for GameSpy, so the online component does still work, thanks to the fans).",

            "review_text": "I want to make a note, that I've only played RA3 for about 6 - 7 h when writing this 'review'.  I can see a fun game in there somewhere, but one major thing really kills the gameplay for me; at least during th solo campaing, and that is the shared economy. I really hate that. Since the AI is always building stuff you can't save up money for things to build, and you are ALWAYS short of resources because of this. It is really frustrating! I was looking forward to having a full co-op campaign when I bought this game, but I was not ready for that design decision.   Otherwise I've been surprised about how well this holds up as a sequel to RA2 and YR. And it is fun that we finally get a main campaign that focuses on the Sovjet side. Sure, previous games have always had the sovjet campaign aswell, but that was not the main story. And having such a great actor-rooster adds to the experience.  The amoun of bewbs (or cleavage) this game shows can be discussed. The twelve-year old inside my 25 year old body is happy, but the game would have been just as good (perhaps better) without it.  So how does the game feel then?  Basically this game is a mixture of the previous C&amp;C titles. You've got the familiar units, all though redesigned, from the RA-series with addition of new units. You've also got the micromanagment system from RA2, which was lacking in the Generals-series; waypoints and hold-fire and stuff like that. Then again, some controls and features from the Generals series have found its way in here. It is really odd to see units and gameplay first feeling like generals, but then also feeling like RA2. I'm not sure I'm all that fond of the mixture yet.   I'm sure my view on this game will change as time goes by. And if I manage to get online I will add that experience to this review later on.   Will I recommend this game for new players? Well if you have RA2/Yuri's Revenge and you somehow manage to play that online then stick with that game, because it is more fluent than this. At least in my humble opinion.  If you don't have anything else, I can surley see this as a viable option. And for 5 dollars on steam it is worth it.",

        {
            "review_text": "Everyone will tell you that this game is a continuation of the wacky shenanigans that happened in RA2, but I really don't remember the game being that wacky and silly. Case in point, in Yuri's Revenge, there was a building that ground up troops for resources all while using slave labor.  Mind you, this was also a game where you fight dinosaurs and hollywood stars were actually commandoes, but I can also say that with the combination of frank klepacki's unapologetically metal soundtrack combined with equal amounts ridiculous and awesome units and set pieces, RA 2 worked on a level that couldn't be replicated.  That being said, RA3 is in no way the game that anyone was looking for. See, what sets RA2 above other RTS games is the idea that a gamebreaker should be countered with a gamebreaker. Just remember the chronotroops and the psychich commandos, its a game with glorious power creep that encourages you to out-do your opponent.  That being said, not only did EA make a pathetic attempt to balance this game, nothing feels as crazy or nearly as fun. Or as balanced.  A focus on naval warfare means that Rising Sun in theory should have an advatage, but with no viable anti-air until at least 2nd tier dock/factory, and to be honest I never used it. Everything feels squishy and underpowered, and nothing is as interesting as it was in RA2, and although Klepacki's soundtrack is fun, its not nearly as engrossing as it was in his other works.  If you're really jonesing for a CnC game, get tiberium wars/wrath of kane.",

Simmons just to name a few + inclusion of offshore battlegrounds: almost every building can be built on water; this gives way to newer tactics + finally, a 3rd faction we can choose from: the Empire of the Rising Sun is an instant favourite thanks to the unit variation (plus George Takei!)  - ore fields were removed: we now have stationery ore mines that are nice but cutting of the enemy's' resources now is not as important or effective as it used to be - campaign could have been a little longer: while there are 9 missions with each side completing the first 4-5 does not take very long - the game desperately tries to show something new with the inclusion of the naval warfare: this is not necessarily a problem but throughout the campaign there's too much emphasis on it  - mediocre coop integration: while playing all 27 levels with a friend is pretty cool, playing solo is pretty difficult at times due to the dumbed-down A.I. that is not always helpful  To summarise: for me the number 2 will be the essential Red Alert title but this one was also pretty neat back in 2008. Running it on modern PCs can be a tad bit difficult - thanks to the uploaded guide available you can find some fixes for the game.",

Red Alert 3 manages to nail the so cheesy it's good feel that the C&amp;C series is renowned for. I love the live action cast, and there is great fun to be had in this game. The units are diverse as are the Factions, the Empire of the Rising Sun has units ranging from GIant Robots to Psychic School Girls, where the Soviets are more docile. Soviets are slow and powerful and the Allies are the most well balanced. Each vehicle has a special ability. This game feels like C&amp;C and it is very fun, even if it isn't of Westwood stature. I highly recommend this game. My only irritation is the lack of buildings and new units. I'm looking forward to picking up Command &amp; Conquer 3 and latter on Age of Empires III!

            "review_text": "Since EA took over westwood the quaility of the C&amp;C series has been on a decline and this is another example of a game made bad. it feels like EA is milking the money cow, starting the game with a time travelling story copied from RA1 with a slight twist where there is a new enemy in the form of the japanese. This combined with over the top cheesy dialogue and bad acting makes almost every moment of RA3 cringeworthy. while cheesy and bad acting is staple of the C&amp;C series its used sparingly, the developers decided to take it a notch up and put it everywhere. pair this with bad taste (the japanese defending pearl harbour from the allies) one just cant help but question the idea behind the game.  Gameplay mechanics have been changed a bit, now instead of having harvesters going for ore, we have deposits where we can build refineries right beside it. our harvesters need only move a very short distance, which totally eliminates the old strategy of economic harassing. the game economics has moved towards something like dawn of war where its critinal to capture 'strategic points' to ensure a large economy.   the factions are now full of 'over the top units', allies have helis that shrink vehicles, soviets have cannons that shoot 'cannonball men' (paratroopers) and the japs are full of stuff copied from animes (mechas and teenage girls). to some it might feel cartoonish but it can be a matter of tastes.  the biggest drawback to the game play i guess it the 'forced' co-op and the wildly spiking difficulty levels of the single player campaign. you must play with a computer beside you, which sometimes the ally computer player totally decimates everything on the map leaving you to attack the enemy base with 5 tanks and win. other times it cant hold its own leaving you to baby it, which spoils the game.  the spiking difficulty is also another that spoils the whole experience, while i do understand that games use cheats to provide some degree of difficulty to the player. i found this to be used too often, even in medium the AI has almost unlimited resources and almost instant production capabilities. pair this with the uneven difficulty across the campaign, you'd quickly have certain missions where its near impossible to pass and those that are almost not impossibel to lose, right after each other.  all in all, i felt that RA3 was cheap idea of generating some revenue. it has nothing about 'gaming' to it and more on selling the brand which is RA. some might like the over the top stuff or the new revamped economics system, but i dont i heard that multiplayer is good but i have not tried it yet. for now considering what i have been through i give it a 4/10",

A combination of wrist-tiring unit micromanagement along with trial and error is the only way to make progress in the campaign.

The story is not something to take seriously with these games, but it is something I wish they took more thought into it because there is alot of holes that just fustrate me not make me laugh.   The multiplayer at this point is slim to dead sadly and they haven't patch any balances, the Allies are so over powered it is insane how good they have it with the freeze and commander choices that just makes it a breeze for them. So I do wish they did cont forth dispite the much hate in the past for it or let some other company work on the series atleast. Its not a bad game but I would wait for a really cheap deal, if your a red alert fan and see a steam deal for the campaign, you can pick it up for a good 7 to 8 hour challange in total for each faction.

So I'm sorry Red Alert 3, but some of us *do* have 8h/day jobs so don't have the time to learn your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ tactics. If you don't have a life / job / wife / family to really spend your time with, then yes, ok, this game is for you. If you do have one or more of the former, then do yourself a favor and *don't* buy this crap. Go have quality time with your loved ones, for your own sake.",

            "review_text": "It's a three way fight between Mr Sulu, Frank N Furter and the dude from Brazil and you're issuing the orders!  Westwood's legendary C&amp;C franchise hit it's high point with this one, beginning just before the climax of Red Alert 2 the Soviets rewrite history by going back in time and eliminating Einstein (oh the anvil of irony) in order to remove the Allies' technological advantage but, in the process, birth a new superpower, the Empire of the Rising Sun, and thu the War of the Three Powers begins with a japanese invasion of the USSR.  Gampelay wise this is pretty much the same Red Alert goodness but with the extra unit/superweapon powers added to C&amp;C3. The Red Alert series has always added more emphasis on Air/Naval power so they took the next logical step and added seaborne bases as well was making a number of units amphibious (Empire probably wins on that score with the amphibious tank though) but C&amp;C is one of the few game series that believed in 'If it ain't broke...' (at least until they did break everything in C&amp;C4...) and Red Alert 3, for my money is the best in the franchise. However Gameplay is largely irrelevant here, the true value in this game lies in it's story and cast. It's as cheesy and stupid as hell as the previous C&amp;C games but that is what makes this series so damn good, especially since Red Alert's lighter tone compared to the gloomy post-apocalyptic Tiberum series allows for what can only be described as bacon-ribs levels of ham acting and it is glorious and what better way to highlight the magnificence of this than getting Tim Curry to be your villain for the evening, this man and J.K. Simmons actively compete to see who can devour the most scenery as the Soviet Premier and U.S. President respectively whilst George Takei provides a subtle but still pretty cheesy performace as the Emperor of Japan. Add to this Johnathan Pryce's slightly bewildered Supreme Allied Commander and Randy Coture and you've got yourself the best cast in C&amp;C history.   If you want a game thats just sheer pleasure and over-the-top fun but still retains a tried-and-true formula that worked right up until EA screwed it up to bury the franchise to concentrate on ten thousand unecessary sports titles then this is the game for you.   Oh, and one thing... Man-Cannons... that is all.",
