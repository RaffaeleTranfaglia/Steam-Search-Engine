            "review_text": "Would be a decent freeware game, but for what they are asking there simply isn't enough content to justify a purchase.  The 70+ non-linear rooms they boast is a downright lie. The game is very linear and a large majority of the rooms are copy-pasted.  All the weapons are identical apart from damage and a few enchantments they can have.  Get it for a dollar, otherwise I'd recommend getting something better.",

            "review_text": "I bought this game because I'm a big fan of the fast-paced expressive combat in Zelda 2. I'd classify that game as 'tough but fair.' In contrast, I find Shadowcrypt to be overly sluggish and disadvantageous to the player for my tastes.",

            "review_text": "Great game, has that old 8-bit feel. This game seems unfinshed though. What is there feels very polished and well made, but it needs a little more imho. An inventory system, more sub-weapons, or some movement abilitys would be great. Even just a simple dash to get through the rooms a bit faster that you have already cleared but have to travel through again.",

            "review_text": "Love it. Very atmospheric and skill dependant. Honestly, for the asking price, it's a tough sell: little variety, extremely short, and few features. However, there's no doubt that the game is fun and well made. The action-rpg elements are a nice touch and the achievements are great to go through. Buy if you're into skill games or games with character. I love that the enemies are random in their attacks. That makes the combat fresh every time for me. I hope there's a sequel that fixes the only issue with this installment: it needs more stuff! Cool music and graphics too.",

            "review_text": "Random drops but designed levels leaves me a little uneasy, especially due to the difficulty. Your ability to progress is at least somewhat tied to what drops you're lucky enough to get. And then when you ultimately die (which will happen a few times, the game isn't straight up pick up and play), you have to trudge through the exact same corridors.  That aside, the game has great atmosphere, and the combat is quite rewarding, in a similar way to Dark Souls. Perhaps the enemies could telegraph their attacks a little bit more, but if you mess up it's usually the player's fault (except that their power is tied to the RNG gods).  Luckily the game is quite short, so it's not as if you'll lose hours of progress upon death. While not perfect, fans of prince of persia, dark souls, metroid or legend of zelda 2 might find something to enjoy here.",

            "review_text": "The game is fun, and works well. The enemies attack faster and are more diligent with attempting to kill the player when compared to previous builds, i'm on V1.31. The enemies must be jealous i'm still alive and they are nooooot ....errr, ok perhaps they are alive, maybe they just want some skin to go along with those bones.   Stupid! There are dark rooms that are pitched black, try upping you brightness to no avail. I found out l later, these rooms require candles that are hidden in various rooms, cant find the candle, your out of luck, or, try watching a Youtube playthrough and Shadowplay your self going through each room with no candle.  Also, Downloading a Steam game in the background? Better think again, this game will halt that download. I'm sitting here waiting for Rise of The Tomb raider to download, and I finished playing Shadowcrypt to find out the game has stopped DOWNLOADING, EERRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!",
