Story is very adorable and cute, scenario focuses on the dilemmas and transformation which the protagonists undergo under the influence our decisions. You can say that game is simple because it has only two routes and one guy to romance, but it has a few nice twists and choices. I recommend this game and I look forward to the next from roseVeRte :)  PS: I was a little disappointed that roseVeRte abandoned its previous graphic style - but I can imagine why.",

A boy becoming a city guard  Otome with single girl and single guy  And the growing pains they endure as they make choices on what they want to be to themselves and each other.  Went through both routes and enjoyed them. I'm a slow reader and do each storyline at a different time to re-experience it, rather than do it once and skip skip skip to just catch the differences right away. Either way there are still enought differences to give you good story. Choices can lead to a human ending and a kitty ending where the last few chapters have a bit of a different storyline to get to similar ending that is a cliff hanger.  They might have a sequel come out (certainly set up for it) as you get there feeling there's a lot of storyline around the two main characters that you only catch glimpses of. Might have been fun to see more of that, especially Juli's character whom is my favorite.   The art is better than past games from them, IMO.  I can't figure out if there's stock music or new music, some of it seems familair to past games, it's nondescript so can't tell. Good background music, though not something I'd want the soundtrack for.  It was a nice fluffy distraction.",

The Human side was much more interseting to me and cute. I did enjoy this game though.  Edit: Played through both sides again and the Human side of the story is definitely much better lol",

I suppose that's because a sequel is planned? But as a story of the heroine and Ronan, it definitely feels satisfying.  Art is very good, although i must admit, i do miss the usual art style. Music is pleasant and i'm absolutely in love with the theme song!  At first i wasn't very sure what to think about characters, but i've grown to like them. Everyone is likeable and well written. My faves are Juli and Mars though, i hope we will see more of them, haha.  In overall, How to Take Off Your Mask is a solid, good game, and i definitely recommend it.",
