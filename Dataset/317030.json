            "review_text": "This game reminds me of my father, he and I did something like this when I was just like Kayla, young and curious. This adventure is remarkable and I will never forget it, this will be a memory for ever. When/if I get a kid in the future, I'm going to make a birthday like this for them. Hopefully they will be as happy as Kayla. The feeling when she got so happy made me cry, such a lovely family. Without the help from Fatty Bear, this epic story would not have been anything, he's a hero and will always be a hero for me!",

            "review_text": "Wow, I think that this game is for the nostalgic persons like myself who played this as a kid. It made me go way back in time and it was great. Althought I would still suggest it today as a simple game if the child is more of a visual learner.  Story - You are Fatty Bear: a magical being comming to life at night to prepare the best birthday of your best friend, Kayla. With the help of her other toys, you have to prep the balloons, the decoration and best of all, bake and decorate her birthday cake!  Gameplay - It's mostly a point &amp; click adventure/discovery game when you have to walk around the house to find all the ingredients for the cake and the decoration. There are some puzzles involves and some backtracking to do but it's mostly straight forward. There is also a bowling game which is not at all related to the story. I think the best aspect of it all is the interaction. In every rooms, there is a ton of objects that have a fun little animation that makes the thrill of the search more interesting.  Graphic &amp; Sound: There is not much to say here. I think that for it's age, it's a good looking game. Colors and objects are well defined. Animations are plenty, fun to watch and are very varied. There is not much dialog in the game but it's entirely voice acted. There is also a piano mini-game with pre-made popular lullaby. You can even make your own little song!   In all, it's a very short and simple game. As an adult, it took me about half an hour to complete but I guess it would take more time for a kid. After 23 years, this game is still as fun as I remembered it and I'm glad I had the chance to relive that adventure!!",

You go around the house at night finding the missing parts to what I consider quest all for this little girl. The game is simple and old, which is a good thing. The game is meant for a younger audience and that exactly what they achieved but it doesn't mean someone of older age wouldn't enjoy. The simplicity is well enough to attract the older audience, enough if they don't finish the game which is extremely short about 40 minutes if you can find things right off the bat. I really enjoyed it reminded me of a more simple time.  (Gifted By Friend) Isn't worth the $6.99 if short on money, but $2.79 is really great.",
