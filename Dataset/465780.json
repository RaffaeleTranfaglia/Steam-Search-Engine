            "review_text": "Welllll being one of the biggest fans of NRC there is, I have to write a review.   First the good - It perfectly recreates the arcade experience, which is what DC was going for, so that's great.   Now the bad - For those of us, like myself, which have been following this from the very beginning, it has been nearly all about emulation. Now, at seemingly the 11th hour, the finished product, while nice, has ensured emulation has taken a back seat to all the rest of the glitz the arcade has to offer.   While I do recommend this experience, it's fun, with lots of customization, I can't help but feel a tinge sad, because this was supposed to be 'The One' we were waiting for, to give us emulation fans the experience (including multiplayer) that we all were so longingly looking forward to. Kind of like 3D Arcade, with the ability to add 100's of cabinets, from all our systems. Here, you get approximately 20 cabinets, which was the same amount as in the demo. Not nearly enough to fit most of the games you truly loved to play. The arcade needs the ability to knock down walls, and remove the pieces you don't want, and replace them with more (and varied) cabinet styles. Once that piece is in place, at least for me, it will be what I am looking for. Until then, a great experience, but missing that one special piece that could have made our emulation dreams come true.",

It has become my favorite game to demo the Vive. I recommend using an Xbox controller to play the games and the Vive controllers to interact with everything else and move around. Also, search the interwebz for skins and whatnot. Visit the game's subreddit for tutorials.",

It happens to be a very fun environment that brings back memories of old school arcades. If you already have MAME or similar games running on your computer this adds a great experience and realism on top of them. If you don't already have emulator games then it can be difficult to get this game working. (Find a good download via reddit to help)  I must have spent days configuring the environment with the right posters, games, etc. That is more time configuring than playing, but that has been part of the fun. (Use Arcade Manager, again, via Reddit, to make it easier to configure.) In the end I was pretty proud of my effort.   Great fun!",

            "review_text": "This will be my first review for Steam I'm just so happy with the results and the the support the devs have kept there word to unlike so many others that I had to share my thoughts about it!  WARNING IT'S A PRETTY LONG READ BUT I WANT TO BE AS ACCURATE AS POSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND:  New Retro Arcade is that special place you might or might not have went to back in the 80's/90's I myself was from the early 90's and just about most of what I remember as a kid going to the Arcade with some friends or even just my family and playing games together having a great time and playing with that machine with a joystick and 4 or more buttons on the side is there!   Why New Retro Arcade Neon holds such a special place in my heart:  Well for Starters I use to go to the arcade quite a bit unforunatly it's been years as the one I went to was taken down and so long ago this program brings that back in so many ways  I'm one the unlucky few without a VR device but even without that the game is solid with Immersion you'll feel like you're still there. The ambient background noises of some of the machines might drive you a little crazy but with all the little features it has to offer it makes up for it greatly  Pros.  Even without VR. you can still see and feel the atomsphere as when playing a game it doesn't go completely fullscreen to it and if you want to feel even more immersed even the buttons and joystick in game move along with your button presses like the real thing!  Has all the neat little side games like whack-a-mole Ski Ball, Air Hockey,Darts,Bowling, the Basketball thing to name some,  Lots unexpected features like a Cinema for watching you're favorite movies or shows or whatever you want if the URL is supported and there's tons! A rec room with other silly things like a guitar and drum toy or that old etch and sketch to name some!  The Community alone and it's Staff are super helpful and kind in the community hub and they seem to listen to it's fans which is a wonderful thing unlike most these days...  This Game shines most for it's Emulators and Rom Support it's like a library of you're favorite games but the way it's done when you manage to get it working and have all the neat cabinet art or even cartridges that the community ethier made by scratch or tributed or get their attract screens from them it really shows what it's cappable of and shows how alive and accurate of an Arcade it truly is!   Last the latest update if you have 2 or more controllers you'll be happy to know they have added Local multiplayer so playing 4 player Arcade Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles side by side can be a reality again or doing co-op Donkey Kong Country is possible and they intend to add more like Light gun game support!  Cons: Of course there are some negatives to the program but they are not entirely game breaking ethier...  Online Support is a thing in fact it can go up to 6 people! but the reason this is in the cons area is because it's not for the Arcade machines or the Gameboy like handhelds lying around or the Super Nintendo like system in the rec room... It's for the other games like Ski Ball,Darts,Hoops there are two kinds of arcade machines by Digital Cyber Cherries themselves one which is a 6 player like Doom-Goldeneye hybrid and then a Zombie lightgun arcade machine which could be considered a testing ground for when real Lightgun support is possible  Lack of Customizations in some area's some people want to modify the magazines and change the Arcade Machines layouts more or even make there own Arcade room from scratch in the editor to name some... There's more but those are the main I see a lot mentioned in terms of customizing...personally I want that but also would like to see Arcade machine layouts like motorcycle or car machines or airplanes and for those classic Nintendo Machines Double Screen support so we can play Punch Out orginal etc  This isn't so much a negative I guess but kind of a request adding a difficulty of credits to start off with would of been neat to have for more immersion and earning tickets from Ski ball and the like so you can gain prizes or even more credits to keep playing would also be awesome! of course keep free play an option for people as well...  Lack of Arcade Machines... 20 something is great don't get me wrong but it would be wonderful to have a ton more or at the very least make a new hub room with nothing but Arcade machines maybe?   Lack of other consoles for immersion purposes Granted we have a Super Nintendo looking like system it seems weird to have a NES or Sega or even GBA game use the cartridge layout of a SNES instead of there own console look and cartridge desgin even if we had an option of a skin over for both I'd be happy  Background sound can be a bit distracting I understand it's accurate but having the option to lower it a bit or completely off for concentration purposes would of been great!  Another one would be Pinball Machines granted I don't quite play those offten even I'll admit an Arcade jus is not complete without some in the area   The last one isn't exactly there fault but due to the tech they use some emulators are ethier non functional or some games won't work Sega Genesiss on Windows 10 PC's will not run instead it crashes and some Arcade Games Crash on here for instance Spy Hunter...   All an all the game is solid in it's own right it holds up true to what it's trying to accomplish and it does it quite well  I'd have to rate it at least a 8/10   because even tho it's negative's are many on it's own the positive's still hold up quite well thank you Digital Cyber Cherries keep up the awesome work I truely look forward to what you have in store for this program in the future!  P.S. I'll update this if anything get's addressed or updated in the future!",

I am amazed how often I see myself playing those old games from my childhood!  But, if I have to say something 'bad', the nausea and sickness produced by the game is terrible (Oculus Rift). I think it would be necessary some kind of teleport system (like the Vive has) as an optional feature to the free roaming (xbox controller). Just my opinion, of course.",

            "review_text": "Edit:   No amount of nostalgia can make me want to spend anymore time in this arcade than i already have.  Pros------------------  &gt;&gt;&gt;They really did nail the enviornment, it is honest to goodness very impressive. There is a great amount of detail in everything from the sound to the lighting- even the way the screens on the cabinets get that CRT effect! Let's not forget the magic of having to hold your gameboy beneath a light source to be able to play the games. It's the little details that make this successful in what it wants to accomplish.  &gt;&gt;&gt;The devs included a small handfull of games in the arcade that include bowling, darts, air hockey, a lightgun game etc. These games are pretty enjoyable when you consider these are actually interactive with other people online.  &gt;&gt;&gt;When the game is working its amazing.  Cons-----------------------------  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I hope you werent thinking that the cabs in the demo would have games running on them out of the steam store. Players are expected to run emulated roms on them and be able to walk around and play a variety of games of your choosing. This sounds like it would be a good idea! There is a bit of a learning curve, and for the average user i cant recommend it, Not to mention unless you browse the forums on this game- you really arent even going to find the files necessary to get this working. Not. Cute.   &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Literally none of the emulation really works anyway. SNES was glitchy, the NES had some terrible sound crackling. Mame emulation is a mixed bag, some work, some dont, some crash the game- the genesis crashes the whole thing so hard i have to get my whole headset off just to restart the whole pc manually ...but the gameboy works.  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; When youre online there is no VOIP service (Which is fine i understand that is getting fixed). Also even if you can get roms running in the arcade, you cant play them with people online (which is honestly fine, i wasnt expecting to be able to do this anyway). You are only restricted to the games that the devs have already included for online play, so why then is there so little?   &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The customization is pretty minimalist and includes only hats. This game could have really benefitted by looking at how rec room created their in game avatars. I dont know if i could make a meaningful conversation with a disembodied vr headset.  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;THE THEATRE DOESNT EVEN WORK FOR ME UNLESS THE FILES ARE LOCAL. WHY? IT ONLY PLAYS VIDEOS AND IT DOESNT EVEN WORK I DONT EVEN UNDERSTAND ANYMORE.  Im so dissapointed with this, the sad part is it has the potential to be one of the must haves on VIVE and drops every ball.",

            "review_text": "I got this game a few weeks ago and went on for 7 mins and nothing worked then it crashed so i ended up not playing till yesterday in hopes of it working and when i went on i was on for a good 12 mins, no machines worked and then it crashed and this happened many times, i would recommend they fix a bit of the tinkering but i know it is hard to do all these scripts, codes and models. And when i tried to refund it was denied because i had it longer than 2 weeks which was probally expected but i only had 30 mins of playtime. i do like the concept and idea they just need a bit of tinkering and make it so its easy to fix even if you dont know a lot for theses reasons i would not recommend, i would have wished i had gotten a refund but im going to delete it anyways since its taking up space and doesnt work that good. just a waste of the 20$ i payed expecting like the trailers and pictures. but instead it was a lot of unfinished work and only a few things that work ok, Ex:The robot but other wise it is not worth 20$ espically if they are bad at understanding refunds and hopefully read it their selfs and not use it auto bot",
