Joke aside, this game didn't need any special programming knowledge to play. It's only moving number from one node to another, add &amp; subtract, and simple conditional operator. The learning curve is a bit high, you could simply solve couple first puzzle with a smile in your face and then bang those same face to the table when trying to solve puzzle number 6. And the pseudo story line encrypted in nodes is also pretty good  Verdict : 9/10 : Need workshop integration",

You get dumped into a screen with bunch of options that pretty much mean nothing to you at that point, you have to enter your programming commands with text rather than clicking buttons or dragging components or anything. Did you know you can hit escape to get a menu screen? Well, it's not like the game tells you that or has a button to click that does that. This game seems like it pretty much goes out of its way to be abusive. And while the programming isn't exactly like writing assembly language in the real world, it's pretty close. The main difference being that you only have one register and a vastly reduced set of commands to work with, but at least they give you up to 12 of these semi-worthless processors to cluster together...  There's a reason that most programmers don't code in assembly language - heck, most programmers don't even learn assembly these days. That's because it's annoying and is a huge time sink. So, Zachtronics made an abusive, poorly-explained, drab-looking game about it. And it's fricking amazing. Possibly the best thing I've played all year.  But not for those who refuse to RTFM.",

It's like being back in my Z80 days, but worse, and just as fun as back then too. Seriously. If you have an ounce of coding knowledge you will sit there crying out for just one more instruction, one more register (other than the accumulator ACC and the hidden 'BAK' that can only be accessed by a SWP instruction, so you can use it to SUB-tract two numbers, etc.), another processor to do this final task, or a way to push that data around with a primitive tight loop.  Never has a JMP instruction been more addictive, or more frustrating.  From the people who made up bash your head against a brick wall and enjoy it in SpaceChem.",

You gotta hand it to them, they’re living up to that mission statement and then some. TIS-100 is another *superb* offering from Zachtronics. Its streamlined, minimal, abstract and scratches that itch that only optimizing algorithms can scratch.

Features a fictional computer with a very simplistic architecture and minimal instruction set, so it should be easy for novices and perhaps even non-programmers to catch on.  No prior knowledge of any assembly language is necessary, though some understanding of how computers work may be beneficial. Though I already had experience writing assembly as a hobby, I can definitely see this game being a nice and gentle introduction for people interested in learning but unsure where to begin (and perhaps intimidated by the specification of commonly used architectures like x86). That said, it does seem like more of a puzzle game than an actual programming game. I definitely recommend moving on to learn a real entry-level instruction set like MIPS/ARM if you enjoyed learning the primitive TIS-100 language.  I recommend this game to anyone who is passionate about programming and computers, though I think the average person may find it a bit dull.  I will definitely be keeping an eye on this developer in future.",

It is much like programming in real assembly language, but more simplified and somwhat modularized to allow people unfamiliar with assembly programming to get the hang of it. I would definately love to see more games like this as i feel it can really peak an interest in any aspiring programmers and build a solid foundation for real world applications.   I would like to reiterate, it is a segnificantly dumbed down form of assembly language, but I feel this game does have some very strong educational roots and can help players develop a foundation for programming.   The game itself has a steep learning curve but provides an incredibly fun and unique challenge to the player, requiring lots of logical thinking. I also like that the game does not have a 1 puzzle 1 solution model, it looks for the right answer not the right way to acheive the answer, witch is fundimental in real world programming. There is no one true way to accomplish anything when programming and I beleive this game really does a good job of playing on that aspect.   Overall I want to say this game is worth more than its price tag, especially if your into programming or logical challenges. at times some puzzles can become stressful when you cant figure out how to solve one, but the game allows you to select from multiple avalible puzzles, preventing you from being hung up on a single puzzle and not being bale to progress.",

I have never manually managed 9 simultaneous processes so I do not know how to manage a system like that. If their was one node that procedurally executed op codes this game would be easier. You also have to pipeline your processes which quickly complicates things. The reason for this is that each node is limited on the amount of op codes you can process.  Although I had fun. I do not recommend this to my friends as none of them program. What would make this game more ledgit would be a tutorial on how you should manage the nine nodes.

I can´t recommend it as to the fact that it could have been so much more. Don´t get me wrong, the game is fun. It shows how much fun you can actually have with numbers and how interesting computer science (coding) can actually be. But it reaches it´s limits on what it can do way too quickly, leaving you with only the thought of what could have been possible. And what also needs to be said, is the lack of any kind of tutorial. Sure the game tries to introduce you to it´s mechanics by starting with very simple levels, tho having to open a pdf to read through pages of (for most people) irritating stuff might not appeal to everyone.  So what is TIS-100? Well it is basically the same as programming tho it extremely restricts you by either limiting the amount of commands you have at your disposal or limiting the amount of lines you can write per module. Having to shorten your label names just so you can write them in the same line as another command should not have been a design choice and should not be something you will need to do. It can be extremely frustrating when your solution takes one more line of code than the module can take, making the game simply not accept your solution. For me, the biggest flaw this game has.  Now maybe some or a lot of people will disagree with me not to recommend this game, but to the person considering to buy it: You appear interested in the game as you read this negative review and the fact that you are still reading is enough for me to say: just buy it. You will have fun and enjoy the game but if you´re looking for more i can honestly only recommend programming...  PS: If you were wondering: yes, programming will need some more time to get into, but as described here, it yields so much more possibilities. This game is a good start to see if you are interested in such logical thinking. If you really are, who knows, maybe taking that extra step and writing your first own programs will be worth it. PSS: If you´re looking for some tasks (basically what the game gives you at the start of each level) i can give you some pretty interesting ones, some of which are actually pretty hard to think through. Those lessons will get you into programming (and into some deeper stuff if you´re a non beginner). Just message me that you´re interested and we work out the details. This offer only counts for Java.",

Okay, so, first thing, right away: You don't have to refer to the manual for every instruction (although the manual is necessary to understand some other information if you aren't technically inclined, e.g you might not know that acc is your arithmetic/general register and is quite valuable later on), because the F1 key will bring up a quick instruction set reference. However, note that it's a quick REFERENCE, so reading the manual is still highly recommended unless you've worked with assembler languages before. At the time of playing this, I was already dabbling in x86 a little, but I did still need the manual for an explanation of the system architecture and how execution works. It wasn't really long of a read for me, and I did my first few exercises within maybe half an hour.   I can see myself completing this game, but if I'm being honest, I doubt I'm going to go back and optomize my code segments. I hate going back to older work, and I especially hate going back just to make it better unless it was something special or personal to me. Bad habit for me to have in this day of bad code, working on it, but for a game, I wouldn't go back and optomize my segments as 'replay value'. Nevertheless, let it be known that this game is the most notable benchmark today of a programming game retailed at a reasonable price to the public. A few programming games of the past come to my mind (Colobot in particular, I highly recommend that especially since it's free and oriented towards C++/Java), but I have not found one so easily obtained, installed, and got running as this one, for lower level assembler languages.    I recommend this game to people curious about computer science on an embedded level (meaning, closer to the hardware, not as abstracted), but really anyone interested in programming, tech, or problem/puzzle solving could benefit and enjoy this if they don't mind needing to refer to a manual now and then when the F1 reference doesn't cut it. However, for those of you looking for a wide variety of provided puzzles and solving/programming that isn't on such a literal level like writing actual 'code', this game might not be your cup of coffee. I would really like to see more games like this exposing gamers to programming on a more literal level, instead of just the 'mindset'... something more PRACTICAL!

On a side note, if you're not a programmer, or not methodical, you may have a hard time getting started with some of these. Take it a step at a time, and you may just surprise yourself.",

Relaunches the game and he is still very confused he doesn't play the game for three months.  Comes back to it after spending some time with a few higher level languages (JavaScript and C#), the game clicks Quickly progresses through first 4 levels.  Gets to 5th level. Quickly thinks of solution. Realizes that he needs one more line of space on the core for the code to run Quietly spends next 2 hours trying to solve the problem.  Brain hurts and he needs a break so he goes and writes this extremely positive reveiw.  10/10 would recommend if you like extremly steep learning curves and hair pulling complexity with what seems like a very simple language (who new moving and adding numbers could be so hard?). No sarcasm. I am genuinly enjoying this game. In fact my only complaint is that there is no control backspace to delete entire words. But seriously, if you don't like that. Dont buy it.",
