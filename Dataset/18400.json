Even worse, Windows 7 is noted in the system requirements, which might mislead someone into thinking this would work on their system.  Given what the other reviews have said, it doesn't seem like it's a good game anyway.",

For those having issues with physics related bugs - One successful workaround seems to be to simply roll back to the original 9.13.1220 Nvidia PhysX drivers that are supplied with the game.",
