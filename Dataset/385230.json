Pros: +Tight controls +Good room designs, fair challenging  Cons: -No map system, no indication for items you've already got, which makes back tracking somewhat painful (yes, there IS back tracking in this game, not much though) -Wall running may not work sometimes",

            "review_text": "Got this game super cheap but still don't enjoy it. I'm giving a good review becuase it is good for the price but it has some pretty glaring problems that annoy me in any game. If this is one of your first games made i say its a good start, but these are things i generally hate in any game.  1. its a jumping game and the jump mechanic is crap. Its not a hard fixed jump length but this game is constantly trying to force you to a fix amount in a given direction. its like you always have to jump atleast 6 feet to the right.   2. The wall grab/run mechanic is crap. Its like i have a magnet sometimes and then other times i'm spiderman running up the wall. also dropping off a ledge on the right wants to push you 5 feet to the left. Which is odd since i'm not jumping off said ledge.   3. You have predefined screens were everything resest each time you die. So you have a good deal of screens that you have to wait, stand still, etc until you can acctually move. Gets annoying when your dying several times on a level to not just beable to just go. nothing fun about starting over and standing still becuase the map is designed so i stand there. If i wanted to do that i could just hit the pause button.  4. Your non-linear map design is good but constantly being given multiple directions to go and then finding out the 2nd direction you went is still not the right direction, gets old. Maybe i'm missing something but i see no direction in which direction i should be picking.   5. The keys that open doors are not always made clear. Or maybe i'm dumb and i'm not getting it/ seeing what item is needed to open a given door. Maybe make the doors bigger and colored different instead of a barely visible image spray painted on a wall.  For the haters, not saying games to hard rather it has some generally annoying features to it.",
