            "review_text": "Once upon a time, I got this game with gems during the steam winter sale. So far I'm not regretting my decision. It's a lot of fun to play, with most levels being difficult enough to provide a challenge while being easy enough to be fun. It's a simple concept, launching a probe that orbits for as long as you can make it, but as the game goes on and more things are added to complicate play it's not hard to see the entertainment value. Great game overall, I completely recommend it.",

            "review_text": "Note: I'm currently going through my Steam library and playing all the games I've never played. This is the first of many quick reviews.   I can't believe I didn't try this out sooner. Sometimes these indie games can either be too dumbed down or too smart for their audience. I believe this one strikes a great balance. Fire projectiles from a moving body and keep in in the play field for the time limit while not running into anything by using the gravity of other moving bodies. Simple to grasp, difficult to master. Graphics and music is minimal but goes well with the space-ish setting. Seriously kicking myself for not having installed this sooner. This will stay in the permanent rotation.",

            "review_text": "This game is a mixed bag that feel is going to be very well received by a small audience, and not so well received by the majority of players. I liked it more than I thought, but I will probably never play it again after this review so I have to not recommend it for most people. Some could find enjoyment here, so here's the good, the bad, and the ugly (also bad):  The good:    A unique premise for a puzzle game.    The music fits the game well. Some of the music slightly reminds me of music from the 2002 film, Solaris.    Simple control scheme that doesn't get in the way of gameplay.    The ability to see where other players launched, but that is also a double-edged sword I feeel (see below).  The bad and the ugly:    It's basically a 'guess where to click to make you orbit the longest' game. The precision of your launces is pretty much down to twitch gaming (click at the exact right moment in time and space).    It's very difficult to intuit what a good launch point is. Maybe the game just has one of those learning curves, but even after an hour of play, I felt like I was just mostly randomly guessing.    Seeing other players launch positions is helpful, but it feels like a crutch to make up for the ability as a player to 1) really get an intuitive feel for good launch positions, and 2) be able to precisely determine those launch positions.    The graphics are nothing special. We're talking about the simplest of geometric shapes and vector graphics.    Sometimes the speed of your launched satellite is so fast, you can see the line segments of your orbit. You can see the individual line segments rather than a smooth curve. Seems very sloppy.    The game gets repetitious pretty quickly. While some new gameplay elements are added (like a 'planet' that repulses instead of pulls in like normal gravity), it just doesn't change up the 'guess where to click' mechanic of the game very much.  Having said that, I still found enjoyment in this game far longer than I though I would have. I'm satisfied with the game overall, but I got it heavily discounted while on sale. As of this review, the game is sitting with a $10 USD price tag, and I find that horribly overpriced. I can't see paying more than $3 USD (or your regional equivalent) for a game like this. There just isn't enough substance here to justify that price in my opinion.  Overall: 6/10.  Get it if it's on sale and you like orbital simulations, spacey ambient music, and puzzle games. If not, you'll probably want to pass.  ",

I loved both of those games and this one fits right in, although with this game you set your actions in motion and anxiously watch the results unfold rather than actively guiding your every move. If you enjoy astronomy, physics, orbital mechanics, and other related sciences in a cursory fashion like I do, then this might be the one for you. Also, I picked it up on a good sale, just as an FYI. I give this game an overall score of 8/10.",
