            "review_text": "This recommendation comes with quite a few caveats. This game is basically a poor man's Super Mario Strikers. It's 5-on-5 (counting the goalies) soccer with environmental hazards and various special moves. It's fun in a very goofy way. The English seems odd, there are bugs (including a few frustrating ones that stop the match and force the user to quit or retry), and the AI could use a little tweaking. The developer is aware of some of the issues, but they haven't updated the game for months, so I don't think we're going to see any fixes. Overall, it's fun, cheap, and goofy, so it might be worth your time and money.",
