            "review_text": "Dead Rising 2 is a game that drops you in the middle of a zombie infested mall, with your ability to concoct the strangest weapon in existence as your only weapon. The greatest asset of this game is the ways in which you can take the environement, and destroy hordes of zombies with it. With some of the most enjoyable weapons in games, memorable and challenging boss battles, some of the best coop gameplay I've seen in years, time management mechanics that add replayability, great controls, some nice visuals for the time of its release, a lovable Capcom style campy story and cheesy dialogue that keeps you anticipating the next one-liner, Dead Rising 2 offers hours and multiple playthroughs of fun.  I'm also glad to say that the PC port is the superior version minus the lack of availability of the Case West DLC, and is actually one of the best PC ports I've played in a while. The PC controls are intuitive, the graphics are a step up from its console iterations, and the patches for the game's major issues on release (saving kicking coop partner and inability for coop partner to save progress are examples) is included.  The game has its problems however, which I think are necessary to point out for the sake of the reader and potential buyer. The first is the overabundance of quick-time-events. I honestly consider QTEs to be a bad mechanic 100% of the time, due to it stripping the gameplay to, 'press x to watch what happens next' or, 'press x to not die.' Unfortunately this game makes you go through one everytime a zombie gets his hands on you. The button prompt changes everytime, so you can't just anticipate it and get it over with quickly, luckily the prompts are always one of the movement keys or waving the mouse around. The PC port's use of Game for Windows Live is probably the PC version's second greatest flaw. Games for Windows Live is horribly unoptimized, and is a chore to use in comparison to Steam. Another issue is one I previously mentioned, the fact that the Case West DLC has not been ported, and is not available on PC, so if playing Case West is a must for you, you might want to consider getting this game for PS3 or Xbox 360, although I'd argue it isn't worth the sacrifices made for the console versions. Two very minor complaints are Chuck's slow movement speed, because sometimes I find myself getting impatient with Chuck's inability to go faster than a jog, and how New Game+ doesn't up the difficulty any. I will say however, that New Game+ is fun in the way that you can try and complete all of the missions before their timers run out, due to you being much stronger.  Despite its issues, Dead Rising 2 rounds out to be a wonderful game, that I whole-heartedly recommend buying.",

I really enjoyed replaying it and maxing out my level and this is definitely a gem I would suggest to others. It still will never be as good as Dead Rising 1 however.  8.5/10",

The thing is useless and disconnects a LOT. The software itself is poorly made. I think everyone can agree to that.  Also this game has the tendency to not freaking work when you download it wrong. When you complete downloading it, the game asks you if you want it to run through steam. People usually say yes because thats the case with most games. BUT for this game you have to say no. Otherwise you cannot run it through Windows for Game. Then you gotta uninstall, download it AGAIN, then say no on that previous pop up which you said yes to.   The gameplay is ok at best. I found the gameplay just an average zombie kiling game. The highlight of this game is you customize your unique weapon. That gets boring after your first one. If your looking for cool way to customize your weapon, go play Borderlands or something. I haven't even touched this game after few hours of it.  ",

You won't be exploring much, I can tell you that. Another thing I don't like are the random bosses. Don't get me wrong, I love bossfights, but I think the game should save first so you don't lose all your progress up to that point. These bosses can be very tough and frustrating and it makes me want to avoid them instead of fight them. It may seem I'm not really positive about this game, but I really, really do like it and I suggest you give it a shot if you're into zombie games and third person survival horror games.

Gameplay is pretty great, its always fun to find out that you can combine a paddle with some chainsaws slaughter 100 zombies with it. :D  The story is interesting with a lot of secret stuff and plot twists, however the animation and voice acting makes the caracters boring and stiff. Also there is next to none voice acting outside of cutscenes, everything is done by text... Chuck's writing is also terrible, they tried to make a badass caracter who says badass one liners do badass stunts and kills thousands of zombies in a badass way. They failed completely. Chuck's classic one liners include: 'Wich one of you punks where throwing trash at me?' and 'Hey poindexters!' Its awful. You can dress up Chuck in very silly ways and he will wear those clothes in the cutscenes. Its pretty funny to see Chuck trying to be a badass in short shorts and a showgirl hat.  The setting is perfect, its a giant entertainment plaza with countless shops and slot machines and with lots and lots of secrets to find. There is so much stuff to do that you it is impossible to see it all in a normal playthrough.  Some complaints is the saving system wich involves you going to the toilet and taking a ♥♥♥♥. Its so easy to forget to save often that when you die you might have to replay maybe 1 hour of gameplay. Its very annoying as you sometimes randomly run into minibosses that kill you very quickly and then have to restart. So remember to SAVE ALL THE TIME! Every time in the safe house and every time you pass a toilet. If you don't do it you WILL regret it.  The minibosses and regular bosses are poorly designed and require you to play in a very specific way most of the time. I suggest you look up guides on youtube.(roosterteeth has some good ones)  Also women are highly sexualised in this game. Many have big breasts and little clothing and the game designers are not afraid of showing them off. The camera often pans over their breasts or behind and at one part of the game a woman bent over to lockpick a door and was clearly exposing her bottom to Chuck. Chuck even comments on this with 'You have some interesting qualities'. Personally I don't have a problem with a little ♥♥♥♥ and ♥♥♥ in my videogames but it is something you might want to consider.

Most people would think that mouse keyboard would fall under controller in a game like this but I actually though the port did a very good job tightening up the controls.

Also for some people apparently the volume is stuck low and the only way to make it louder is to crank your speakers, which can be a problem for headphone users.  It has a coop mode that still has the odd person around to play with, although everyone I managed to play with was kind of laggy.  I'm sad that Capcom won't rerelease it without GFWL, but considering how lazy of a port it was, I totally understand their position.  Play it while you still can!",

Explored very little of the game due to the unforgiving mission deadlines but a second playthrough with leveled up characters with no pressure to pursue deadlines might be a lot of fun.  Felt that the game should have supported more cooperative elements...like pushing each other around on wheelchairs, garbage carts, etc. As it stands, being near your co-op partner when they're wildly swinging just results in a large loss of health.

You're either playing the game to win (not so fun), or wasting time with friends and completely screwing up the campaign story. Stressing about time management is best left for the real world, not here. Outside of that, playing this game with a friend makes the time issue bearable.",

There's a story, and it's fairly decent, but it doesn't take itself overly seriously or get in the way of anything.

This game gave me a real good laugh, and it has plenty of replayability with 5 different endings!
