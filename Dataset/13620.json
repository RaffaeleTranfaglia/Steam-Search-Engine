            "review_text": "This game is awesome. It took me 2.7h to complete the game.  I will do some pros and cons for the game  PROS -The game graphics are pretty decent comparing the game to other games from '02 -The mechanics of the game are awesome. It's not like shoot them up, you have to think of your own startegy to pass the Mission -This game is one of the more realistic games, when they shoot you 1 time, you'll probably die -In this game it is required to commander 1 or 2 teams(depends on how many teams you will take), and you can send your troops across the map with your orders because they will not move if you don't tell them to move -Max number of teams is 3(including your own team), so the game is not that hard to play -Couple of bugs but no need to be worried about -The game is forgotten but it doesn't need any updates or patches except for your team mates - in the beginning of the Mission they don't always say what they should say -You can make a perfect teams of Ghosts waiting for your command -The game is 8 Missions long. Too short if you ask me but that doesn't bother me at all -Community isn't dead but there aren't many players that patrol through the Community Hub -Models for the game are ok, they have made some new ones and they added some new weapons to the arsenal -Enemies now drive other vehicles besides tanks and SAMs  CONS -Multiplayer is dead,  ubi.com  isn't working for the game. Only GameRanger supports Multiplayer now, and there aren't any servers online -You can't jump in the game  I recommend it. 8/10 Would destroy 3 tanks in a row again!",
