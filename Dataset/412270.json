I'm writing a review early because it's a travesty that this game has so few reviews; I intend to update it later. But I've played enough to know the positive rating is deserved.  Simply put, if you like Zelda you will probably enjoy this game.",

            "review_text": "A slick Zelda clone. There's a high chance you might like it. And I really wanted to like it but I'm requesting a refund out of specific reasons. Hate to be that guy, but here's why.  I'm a parent and don't have much time. And this game tries too much to waste my time.  The attack animation stops movement. Pushing boulders takes such a long time. And the first dungeon is filled with sokoban involving pushing boulders.  What led me to quitting the game: I made it past a certain gate, past the first sokoban puzzle behind, and failed at the next puzzle (balloon). Then I realized that if I wanted to reset the balloon, I had to backtrack and do the sokoban again. Slowly pushing boulders. I don't ragequit in competitive games, but here I did.  Now I appreciate the older Zelda games even more. They were limited to (mostly) one-screen-at-a-time, which led to slick and elegant design. Sadly, this is not what I can say about this game. I guess there is fun to be had for people with more patience and time, but it's not for me.  Best of luck with your next project.  One last thing: the game does establish the sense of discovery, but apparently I'm to collect eight... objects? Just about any other word would invoke more sense of w onder: amulets, shards, essence... but objects?",
