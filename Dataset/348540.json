The voices have different audio levels and don't sound very professional but they give a nice touch to the game, I like them.  Then... Do you recommend this game? I can't recommend this game at that price. I think £12 for this game is too much... There's other VN longer and better for this price. But if you find it for less than £4-£5 you'll have a nice time!  Why Steam does not have a neutral recommendation?   EDITED:  When I posted a honest opinion in the discussion forums, without being rude or breaking any steam guidelines, about what I thought about having this game bundled a month after release, causing a devaluation of the game and affecting kickstarter backers and release date buyers, they deleted my opinion completely. Without any comment or justification.   From now on I will avoid this company games unless they contact me with an explanation.",

Less Synthetic Comment   This isn't a memorable visual novel. There are very few choices you need to make during the game, probably less than ten. You are able to watch all the finals in less than four hours and after that there are no reasons to re-play it. The art style is quite good, some dialogues are decent. The story (if you can call it that) has only a few interesting places. The characters are all the same, with minor variations in their design. The price is also too high for any Visual Novel and for this one in particular.  Rating  5/10  Linux Version  No issues (as it was easy to predict) 10/10",

            "review_text": "This game is relatively short, I had completed everything in just 6 hours. I don't believe this game was worth its price based on its length. But its short length is a very minor problem compared to the other issue I have with this game; and that is with the two main girls in the game: Aphrodite and Athena. They are two of the most annoying characters I have ever seen in a game, and I really didn't like going through their routes and ending up with them. Sakuya and Taka's routes were better for the most part, but even Aphrodite's and Athena's roles in these routes were enough to get me frustrated. Unless you like games with really annoying, stuck-up women in them, I do not recommend this game.",

            "review_text": "First off, the positives: The artwork is nice and detailed, and the voice acting is pretty good. It looks really nice and professional.  Then, the major issue: The writing. Looking at it on the store page I was expecting something cute and silly with a plot a bit like Shuffle!. The premise is like something straight out of an anime, so I was expecting an anime-esque romp. I was rather disappointed. It reads like a first draft. I don't want to be mean, as there is clearly a fair amount of work put into this game, but the writing really lets things down. The characters are barely formed at best, and actively unlikable at worst, and the plot logic is disorienting in its randomness (the bit with the parents walking in on the demi-god girls naked...it's not even funny, it's just weird). I feel that if the game had just gone all out in terms of sillyness and been a bit more self-aware, (maybe a bit more like Huniepop), it would be better for it. As it is, things are just kinda awkward. It's a shame because the starting premise is pretty decent and some of the plot elements (the one girl turning out to be a demon, or the protagonist getting one of the love interests pregnant and stuck on earth) are kinda cool - overall it just feels rushed though. And I'm not even going to start on the weird emotional manipulation and nasty relationship bull...I make allowances considering it's supposed to be a rom-com sort of thing and all but it really made me cringe.  I got this on sale, but even then I don't feel it was wholly worth the price considering the state of the plot. There are far better romance visual novels out there in my opinion. Cute art though, and if you can put up with the cringey plot, fair play to you.",

It's alright, but far too short, and as some other reviewers have said, too cookie-cutter with some of the endings, could have used a lot more variety. For what it was, and the fact that I paid $4 for a bundle with 6 other games in it, I liked it a bit, but there's no way I would have paid full price for it. Save your money and buy Princess Evangile if you can't find it for cheaper than full price.",

            "review_text": "After playing the disasterous remastered version of Beach Bounce I have become very skeptical of Dharker Studios. As for Divine Slice of Life, it was not the best Visual Novel I have ever played. Far from it, it still has it's problems but that doesn't change the fact that it was a major improvement from Beach Bounce.  First off, having our main character as the reincarnation of Zeus was too funny, and having these two girls, Yui and Ryn fight over you because of your 'destiny' to ascend to godhood and choose one of them adds a very interesting story instead of just having them fight over you because they want you.  As for Aaki himself, not a very interesting protagonist. He's very weak in terms of other VN protagonists, even though he's a reincarnation of Zeus.  Yui and Ryn are just too funny that you can't help but fall for them, as they continously refer to you as their 'king' made me laugh a bunch.   Then you have Sakura, the hottest girl in school who's dating the most popular guy in school and how you and he but heads over her. Then there is the typical childhood friend Taka who has loved you since you were kids. Not original I was rolling my eyes the whole time.  One thing Dharker does get right is the music and artwork. Music sets the mood in certain situations and the artwork is absolutely beautiful.   And in this VN we actually have voice acting. Very cool as most VN's don't have voice acting. Unfortunately, the voice acting in this game is not good. Even if you turn the volume down, it's still hard to hear. But if anything, I'm glad they decided to include it rather than not have it at all.  5/10: Average. It's not really the best but it's not bad either. I just wish the protagonist was more relatable and that some of the other girls besides Ryn and Yui were original. All of that and if the game was longer, I would've gotten a 6 or maybe a 7.   It's a step in the right direction from Beach Bounce and I recommend buying this after a price drop. This game has also given me hope that Dharker has learned from Beach Bounce and will try their best to make better VN's.",

Chosing either girl forfiets the rest of the game for literally no reason other than the plot wills it.  2/10, only got so high because few VNs have voice acting A: in english, B: of a decent quality and C: voiced MALE characters.",
