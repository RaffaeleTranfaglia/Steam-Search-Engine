It has the voice of Rik Mayal who is a brilliant narrator and it plays better than worms but sadly I can't recommend this as it won't allow you to play it on Windows 10 ( why sell it without the ability to play it on modern computers ). I hope they will correct this soon but sadly I am dissapointed that I couldn't play it/",
