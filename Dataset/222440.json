            "review_text": "(My first-ever Steam review)  The Steam version of the Xbox360 port of The King of Fighters 2002 Unlimited Match is great! Having played KOF 2002 in the arcades (back n 2002), KOF 2002 Unlimited Match for the Japanese Playstation 2 (which I still own), and the Xbox360 version of Unlimted Match (via Xbox Live), I can say that the Steam port is as good as the Xbox360 version it is based off of. A handful of achievements and numerous 3vs3 and 1vs1 match options abound, but at the heart of it all, KOF 2002 Unlimted Match is a deep fighting game, yet decent online competitve experience.  Those new to the King of Fighters series will find a MASSIVE roster of characters from which to choose from; each representing their own series from SNKPlaymore's extensive history of both fighting games and action-adventure titles. From the Psycho Soldiers and the New Faces Team to multiple versions of Kyo Kusanagi and a completly revised K9999 (K-four nine) called 'Nameless', Unlimited Match boasts a wealth of fighting styles and over-the-top moves to utilize against your opponents. Offline, controls are sharp and responsive which means that special and desperation moves require precise motions to successfully execute (using a comtroller or arcade stick is highly recommended). Combos are fairly easy to pull off and juggle combos abound.  Online, however, is where the port takes its beating. As with nearly every fighting game that isn't say, Skullgirls, lag is and will be an issue. Whether it actually works, there are a few online options that you can tweak in the options menu to reduce input lag (from 1 to 9) and see the input lag measured on-screen for your convenience. Some matches will be decent, while others will be slow and painful to play; if you have been playing fighting games on Steam for a while, then it will be nothing new.  As for this port, everything from the console version has been replicated flawlessly (including the widescreen boarders, which you can change via a few options). Graphics-wise, there are a standard host of resolutions and sprite sharpening options to suit your preferences; however, keep in mind that the Steam version is based of a game from over a decade ago, so the graphics will obviously have aged...badly, when compared to other fighting games. The Endless Mode is simply a survival mode, while Challenge Mode requires you to master character combos with the utmost precision and skill to advance to the next challenge. Rounding this out is a completely 'new' soundtrack (the arcade version of 2002 had a different soundtrack) that hosts great remixes of famous themes while adding many new arrangements.   Overall, The King of Fighters 2002 Unlimited Match is a great fighting game for local versus play, but for online, the lag and latency hurt it and keep it from being a top-tier option for those wanting to prove their online superiority against others. Only time will tell if the port developers continue to fix the and tweak the netcode to where it is good enough to make the majority of players happy.",

Character diversity is amazing people play whoever they want. With combos were like KOFXIII but it doesnt matter you can still do some crazy stuff here.   Pro  + Large ♥♥♥ roster  + Netcode is good the Ping is lying  + Angel &lt;3 + Its KOF 2002UM   Cons  - Online is kinda vacant at the moment... - Kyo army which I am a part of  - Execution (Not a con but for casual the execution barrier kinda high)   I say Buy it if you have a friend to play with for an extended period of time if not you can for sure find people online just dont expect it to be ASAP or have them stay for a long period of time.",

            "review_text": "This game is freaking awesome!  Recently I've been really into the old Fatal Fury games from SNK, namely Fatal Fury 2 and Special, which is why i bought KOF XIII not too long ago. While KOF XIII is a great game and is a lot of fun to play, so far KOF 2002 is my favorite of the two. The roster of 2002 is way bigger than in XIII, (there are 66 fighters for you to pick!) i really like the pixelated style of the game and many characters got an overhaul by getting new moves added to their moveset. The controls are fluent, the special moves are easy to remember and use and i also like the fact that it actually makes a difference if you do a special move with either a light kick or a hard kick, that adds a lot more strategy to the fights.  The netcode of this game is a mixed bag, sometimes the netcode is really good, the game is fluent but other times the game runs really slow and / or choppy, but most of the time it's good. You can also see the ping difference between you and the guy you want to play against in the lobby, so if the ping is too high, you can still leave or kick the guy.  The developers are also very close to the community, they patch the game regulary and the community as a whole is very helpful.  So overall, if you enjoy fighting games with a huge variety of characters and a very high learning curve (and if you are not afraid to get your ♥♥♥ handed to you online) get this game. You won't regret it.",

You play a little more in order to reach it again. You don't reach it for some reason. 4. You finally reach it again after so long. Once again, you get reminded why it tells you to do the best you can. 5. You finally have an idea how to reach the stage. You still don't have any idea how to beat it fair and square,  no matter how many times you reach it .  9001/10. One of the best boss fights in fighting game history.",

            "review_text": "  **** QUICK REVIEW **** (focussing on online)      THE GOOD   If you're a fan of the older games, and you have someone  (or several)  to play with, you should get this. Basically, it's the ultimate resource for KoF, and I think this is the best overall roster list you can get right now. You can see the complete roster online, but you're really spoiled for choice with this game!  It also has great controller support. Both my Xbox 360 pad and my SNES pad work perfectly, which isn't all that common for the SNES pad. And of course, keyboard is there for those that want it.    THE BAD   There's not really a story mode though, and this means there's no character interaction beyond the intro to a fight, where some characters might have a unique animation+sound depending on who they meet  (e.g. Shingo vs Kyo) . But keep in mind it's all Japanese audio with no subs.     THE ONLINE   KoF13 has connectivity issues, but in 2002 Ultimate Match  online play actually works!  However, you may have to 'shop around' players for a decent ping  (there are no servers, it's all peer to peer) . I've found anything up to  250ms to be perfectly smooth while 500 was unplayable .  Online play is dependent entirely on ping, so if your opponent is based far away, the game will slow down to keep both players  exactly  in sync. This means that you can play with anyone in the world and have an equal chance to win, but far away players result in the game being played in slow motion! The closer you are to them, the faster the gaming experience. You can see someone's ping before you play with them and cancel out if it's too high, but if you accidentally go ahead, there's no way of quitting without forcing the game to close via Windows!   Possible Tip: There's a setting in the Network section of the Options menu that lets you change the frame count for input when online. Normally it's set to 9, but after changing it to 3 I got far better pings on opponents. It could be coincidence, but it's unclear how they've implemented their netcode. ",

The Netcode's all right, though if you play wirelessly, you're going to have a bad time. Definitely go wired.  Also, in true KoF fashion, prepare to have your face rammed into the ground by SNK Boss Syndrome. The game features four boss characters from KoF '99 to regular 2002 and they are no push overs. Test your skills and try to run right through them. You may even be greeted by a surprise challenger...",

            "review_text": "One of my personal favorite fighters and the perfect KOF experience, and a fine example of SNK Playmore's work and fighting games in general. Boasting a huge roster of over sixty characters, all with different movesets, beautifully designed stages and a deep combo system, KOF02UM is easily the pick of KOF games on Steam and in general, 'Unlimited' is definitely a word that's perfect for the game, due to how big it is.   2002 Unlimited is an expansion of the Dream Match game The King of Fighters 2002, both games have no story, but the single player experience is still very fresh while keeping things 'KOF'. There are Arcade modes for both 3v3 and 1v1, as well as challenges, an endless mode, as well as free Player vs CPU battles, and of course, a mode that allows you to practice and perfect your skills and special moves.  The multiplayer experience is just as expansive, allowing both Team and Single battles online and offline, something not available in most KOF games. Though SNK Playmore isn't known for providing the best netplay experience, it's definitely worth a shot, especially if you have a friend to play Player Match with.  The sprites, although pretty retro, still hold up quite well now, with some nice shading detail and coloring and a pretty range of palettes. The stages are beautifully designed and the music is enough to get any player pumped for a three on three rumble.   Despite a couple of downsides [lack of color editor and plot.], 02UM has many hours of gameplay to offer, while keeping to what's truly KOF and not blowing new players off of their feet with too much to do. Whether or not you're trying to get into KOF, or you've played it before and you're looking for more, 2002 Unlimited is the next direction to go by far.",
