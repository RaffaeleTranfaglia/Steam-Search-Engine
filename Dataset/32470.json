This is the best rebel scum killing simulator since Star Wars Galaxies. Even if you aren't good at stradegy games play easy as the empire and you will have the most fun you ever had killing rebel scum like anoying cockroaches mildly annoying your empire of unstoppable stardestroyers and at-ats. You can even take control of an entire planet using only stormtroopers and patrol frigates.",

The gameplay is really well done as there are so many details. either you have, plants that spit poision, nebulas,threatful blizzards, erupting lava pits, and astriod fields... You can also play on plane no threat levels if you feel like it. sadly mods arnt really a thing on steam no workshop...

Its just a plain and simple game with hundreds of hours of fun and maybe more. It dosen't say I have that because I played it years ago not on steam. Of course you can either play as the evil Empire or the Rebels, I have to say I found it easier to play as the Empire compared to the Rebels, but when your the empire and you finally manage to buil the Death Star it is so amazing, its just like your in the movies but instead of watching it your controlling it :) If your a Sci-Fi fan, RTS/ strategy or a Star Wars fan I would recommed getting this game now, I would say it is worth the money because there are so many skirmishes you can play and depending on how you play the campaign can go on forever literally, I even built the biggest fleet with over 200 space craft and possibly more and my laptop was lagging due to the ammount of ships I had in the game lol.",

The rebellion are annoying to fight against, with strong abilities to evade space fights and strike right at the ground, having the most number of heroes and the strongest collection of force users. Their space units aren't too shoddy either  The Zann consortium are a nice, interesting faction, able to corrupt planets to make invasions easier. they have the most credits of anyone, and are incredibly survivable compared to the other two factions, able to stick around through deviousness and stealth, like the rebels. They lack any particular strengths in terms of space or land, but their Droidekas and Canterous Tanks make excellent ground forces, and their Keildabe-class battlecruisers aren't too shoddy.  The Empire is glorious. Pilot the SUPER STAR DESTROYER Executor in climactic (and very one-sided) battles across the galaxy, exploding space stations and planets with the Death Star and being incredibly intimidating and awe-inspiring. The Empire, despite less population space in space, is clearly the winner in any machup, and on ground the formidable arsenal of AT-AT's, Stormtroopers, AT-AA, Sith, and repulsor tanks makes them nigh impossible to remove without heavy losses or superior tactics.  Empire at war is for anyone who has ever wanted to feel the sheer power of commanding thousands of units into space battle against thousands of other units. For the Empire!",

            "review_text": "might not be the best rts but its definatly a good star wars game command your armies to take over the galaxy pretty straight forward whats special about this is you got two forms of combat, land and space which really makes capturing a planet a process since you have to get both to have full control of the planet,though you can send smaller units, particularly heros and you wont have to deal with the space battle units are broken up into infantry\\fighters, light vehicles\\small ships, artillary (or what would be called glass cannons), heavy vehicles\\big ships and heros  heros are pretty self explanetory, the characters you know can fight on ground battles and some in space, alot of them can land on planets undetected and have special abilities, once a hero dies they will recharge before they can be brought back in again in the galactic modes you can build structures on planets that allow you to build units, get upgrades, etc every planet can build a space station which like some ground stuctures provides free garrison units when the planet is attacked ships and space stations are build up of hard points, hard points normally contain various types of turrets, shields, hangers, engines and special weapons, i thought this was really cool considering you can focus your forces on the most important hard point similar to how you attack the enemy ships engines, bridge, communication and life support in star wars battlefront 2 however these hardpoints contributes to the ships fuction and if they are destroyed they are gone for the rest of the battle (ex your engines are destroyed you go really slow, your shields are destroyed you have no shields)  one of the things that i disliked about the game is that you can auto result a battle which will automaticly complete the battle and show you the results the only problem is it decreases your winning chances signifgantly, auto battle is only a viable option when you want to give up a planet but want to take some forces with you but sometimes it wont even do that and if you do win you will get signifigant loses some units arent even properly balanced another thing is that the galatic conquests maps are always so split apart i enjoy the mode the most when you start off on less than 6 planets and have to beef up your defenses before going on the offenses, the problem is either your planets are two and far apart or you have too many planets and not nearly enough time or money to prepare your planets  i wish there where more galactic conquests though because skrimish is well skrimish and campagin is obviously very directed but then again you can always download custom ones so thats not a big deal i highly suggest getting the republic at war mod it really adds alot all and all its a enjoyable rts but not perfect",

Planets have natives allied to the different sides that will help that side in any battle there (Rebellion/Empire/Zhan Consortion) and also provide unique bonuses for whoever controls them.  The bundle also comes with 3 full campaigns, the third culminating in the player controlling a Eclipse-class super star destroyer complete with it's very own anti-ship superlaser. Not to mention that the Empire can build the Death Star itself and use it to destroy enemy planets.  Also, X-wings, lightsabers, and Darth Vader.  Why don't you have this game? RATING: 9.5/10",

EAW is an RTS hybrid that tries to be many things but is tripped by technical issues, bad design decisions and a clear lack of testing. The end result is a game that is mediocre at best and only held together by the magic glue that is Star Wars. Only recommended for fans who are willing to suck on a lollypop made out of pure salt just because it's shaped like Darth Vader's helmet.   +Authentic Star Wars music and sound effects that leave nothing to be desired. Sometimes even the voice acting is surprisingly good +Graphics seem fairly timeless with some space battle effects still looking pretty sweet +Space battles are fun most of the time +Asymmetric factions (Empire has bigger ships with free fighters, Alliance has better fighters that require no carriers etc.) +Multiple campaigns and conquest mode scenarios +Dropping the screen filling Executor in the middle of a battle for the first time should make any nerds inner fascist climax immediately  -Doesn't seem to play nice with Win10 and has no borderless window support. If played fullscreen while Alt-Tabing can put your Windows in a state where you have to reboot to get anything done. I recommend running it in a maximized window instead. -Game breaking bugs include disappearing critical characters, inability to task units to campaign critical missions, disappearing units etc. These issues can be somewhat circumvented with furious saving.  Always save to a new file!  -A multitude of UX issues that range from fighters needlessly blocking capital ships from selection to the way save files are handled: latest saves don't always show up first, save files take too much space etc. -AI blatantly cheats both by its very nature and also seems to gain scripted fleets out of nowhere for the campaigns -AI sometimes just freezes and does nothing with its ships in battle -Unit AI is atrocious and does not seem to do any target prioritization whatsoever for any attacks. Pathfinding gets progressively worse with unit size to the point where units like AT-ATs, artillery units and Star Destroyers sometimes require near constant micromanaging so that they move the way you need -Being unable to assign any movement orders on the galactic map in pause mode makes no sense -Forces of Corruption doesn't integrate to the main game and is actually a separate game that feels like it was cheaply hacked together in a hurry -While the original EaW is somewhat balanced, the Consortium faction in FoC is completely out of whack and seems to have the best in almost everything in addition to their frustrating corruption mechanic that requires constant fiddling especially from the opponents -Ground battles are usually horrendously repetitive and tedious -Battles can be autoresolved, but the logic for resolving them is completely ludicrous and can lead to massive casualties even if the opponent doesn't actually have any chance of fighting back -Very limited amount of units and ships in a battle at any given time (for example, you can have 6 Imperial class Star Destroyers if you have almost nothing else) and the rest have to be drip-fed into the battle as reinforcements when previous units are destroyed -Player can't choose which units enter a battle first in EaW (mostly fixed in FoC though) -Flying units can't actually fly over many obstacles in ground battles -Some of the writing and voice acting is very cringeworthy especially in FoC. A few characters also use quotes from the movies to a ridiculous degree even for fanservice -The Alliance can commit genocide without any issues and can actually get more funds from it",

It brought about major leaps in technology and laid the groundwork that permitted post-war social changes including the end of European colonialism, the civil rights movement in the United States, and the modern women’s rights movement, as well as the programs for exploring outer space. The primary combatants were the Axis nations (Nazi Germany, Facist Italy, Imperial Japan and their smaller allies) and the Allied nations, led by Britain (and its Commonwealth nations), the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America. The Allies were the victors. the nazis must have had ADHD because they lost, im a part of the allies because i like camels. im going to go ride a camel.

But after playing for a good 5 hours, I can tell that this is not a Star Wars game that I like. Which is very rare for me.   My experience with it so far has been pretty horrendous, mainly through seemingly cheating AI mechanics and sudden difficulty spikes. Naturally, I was playing on Easy, and I'm not great at RTS, but I sort of assumed it would be more like C&amp;C where you would have time to build up your forces and then assualt the enemy. Its not like that at all. My experiences come from C&amp;C Red Alert and Generals and I've also played a fair amount of Shogun Total War. My issue I feel is that the time scale of the game literally leaves you behind within 30 seconds.   In Galactic CQ, I am frequently being raided and out-gunned within the first 5 minutes of play. The AI steam rolls as it doesn't seem to be confined to the amount of actions a human could physically decide upon and take. The AI is so precise and clinical in its processes, that within the first 5 Galactic days, the Rebellion already has amased an economy 5 times greater than my own. I've been through forums and such and there seems to be no real answers about why this game is so different in play style to C&amp;C or Shogun. But I feel its the fact that the AI moves so fast.  Personally I was looking for a more casual Star Wars C&amp;C clone. This is not what this game is, unless you're already good at such game. I feel like I would have enjoyed it more if I had time to learn and not be swept off the game board almost immeditly by huge fleets which can't physically have been created with only a starting credit cap if 5K. Inexperience is also a deciding factor. The tutorials are decent, but they don't really provide you with the load of how much you have to do and organise. Also, the reinforcement mechanic which the player is forced to use, but the AI can happily spawn tanks etc against you... is just broken.   Also, don't bother playing the expansion. The 3rd faction is so OP that there is literally no point, unless you like seeing all of your 'owned' worlds, completely corrupted and leeched within 30 seconds.  Just glad I bought it on sale. If we consider £1 for 1 hour of play-time, I'd say the game at least achieved that.",

Yes, there's a pause button on the galactic map, but you can't do anything while paused like move fleets or build units. It only works on the tactical map. Also, some of the scenario maps seem glitched on tech levels. If you go to advanced settings and reduce the starting tech level while playing on hard, then you start with reduced technology but the computer starts with regular technology. Having X Wings, Y Wings, and basic frigates doesn't really match top of the line Imperial Star Destroyers.  There's also no hold position command. You can tell units to stop, but it's very easy to lure or get lured, especially when units won't respond instantly after being lured. This creates a very annoying situation where rocket infantry wreck light tanks, anti-infantry vehicles wreck light infantry, and aircraft become pointless (although aircraft dominate easily until AA weapons are around). In space, it means fighters and bombers won't withdraw from cruisers, and larger ships that are slightly misoriented beacuse they advanced two inches too far take forever to turn around.  The game really isn't that bad, but it's like they choked it for no good reason and ruined the experience. If the units were responsive, tactical map unit caps didn't exist, the galactic map was turn based instead of real time, and the pause button let you issue orders while paused, then this would be an easy thumbs up. I have no idea why they ruined their own game with arbitrary restrictions.",

There is also, of course, multiplayer.  Graphics are great, sound effects are flawless, soundtrack lends from most of the original tracks from the trilogy of movies, so you can bet your ♥♥♥ there is going to be some great music playing while you blast your way through the galaxy with the Death Star at your side.

Replayed it on Steam all these years later and it haven't aged a day, still had fun with it. If you're a fan of the genre, there is not much to think about.

Worth mentioning is that the Multiplayer hasn't worked since 2014, so if you want to play with someone else, you need to use something like GameRanger to make it think you are using a LAN, rather than being in seperate places. Of course, the singleplayer Galactic Conquest is excellent, and will keep you more than happy without multiplayer.

In the base game, there is a Fully Fledged Campaign for both Empire and Rebellion as well as a Galactic Conquest, which if you have ever played Star Wars Battlefront II then it would be familiar. Although, it's much better and you get to Control The War. Annnndddddd, there's also Skirmish where you can practice against AI and battle with them. This is my go-to mode.   Now, I just need a Sequel from EA with Frostbite. There is actually gameplay of a new Star Wars RTS, but i can't tell whether it's legit.  Bai da gaim.",

If you like units with nifty abillities to help you pull of tactical victories, the Rebellion will suit you just fine.

I usually compare this game to Halo Wars on Xbox 360. The gameplay is very similar to upgrading buildings and telling troops where to go on the battlefield, and the space combat is exactly the same. There is an out of battle part of the gameplay (unless playing Skirmish Mode) where you send fleets and troops to other planets to attack, reinforce, or retreat. You also train troops and build ships and space stations for when you actually fight in this part of the game. There are heroes in the game you can play as (Darth Vader, Boba Fett, Han Solo, Chewbacca, Luke Skywalker (Red Squadron in base game only, Jedi Knight in DLC only), Yoda, and more). This game was a gateway drug to strategy games for me and I was obviously attracted to it as a Star Wars fanboy, but this really did get me into strategy games. The only thing I might be worried about is the fanboy level in this game. If you are not a fanboy, this game is still worth trying, but you might get bored way too early.",

It may take itself a little bit too seriously, but it makes up for it in outlandish gameplay. You will play as the Rebels, or the Empire, in a battle for control of the galaxy. This game offers both a campain where you must fight on a galactic map, or skirmishes set on premade worlds.  You can take to both space, and land to fight the war. There are a ton of unique units to play with, everything from a snowspeeder, to an AT-AT, to a Rancor. The gameplay is basically a mix between king of the hill, and base destruction. WHile the game is fairly balanced, you will find that the enemy AI is extremely reliant on artillary forces, which can fire through the FoW, and essentially deal massave damage to anything it hits, which can be extremely frustrating when you have a ton of infantry or light vehicles grouped together.  All together, I would buy this when it is on sale. It is a nice game to pass time, and relive your old Star Wars fantasies.",

Ship movement is fluid, and the AI seems somewhat realistic in sticking with the tactics of their respective STAR WARS sides/teams.

Commanding either the Rebellion, Empire, or the Zann Consortium to take the battle to the ground and to space across the galaxy using iconic ships, vehicles and heros of the Empire and Rebellion as well as the new forces of the Consortium. As fun as this game is, its sorely lacking and will get boring relatively fast. That and the empire and rebellion are sorely missing a large number of their forces from the EU in the game as standard and most if not all of the models are rather under detailed. Thankfully EaW has(had) a very large modding community offering things from minor map packs to entire total conversions bringing you from the Jedi Civil War of KOTOR fame, to the Clone Wars, to the grimdark era of the late EU. If you track down any of these mods to help liven the game up then I fully recommend to play this. Even as stock this game is worth a shot. This game deserves a mention as one of the better Star Wars games. Check it out if your a RTS fan and if you like to mod.",

Honestly, if EA updated the graphics and some of the mechanics/units, they could probably get away with reselling the game. If you have any interest in Star Wars, GET THIS GAME.

Second thing is that I would have loved to see an expansion following the extended universe, I wanted so much to fight the battle of Byss and had a level destroying World Devistators plus battling the Kiss Empire (I know there was probably a mod for one of these, but still). The third and easiest change I would have loved would be for the standard runthrough for the Rebels would be following the Deathstar blowing up, retaking the galaxy and the Empire having further and further more sophisticated units and weapons while the user lags behind the advances, or not, just further pushing Empire into a ball that makes it more and more difficult to fight. Anyway, I know this is an older game and my three points are nit picking, it is an incredibly good game hands down, such a good game, do buy it",
