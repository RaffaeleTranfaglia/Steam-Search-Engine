    "description": "Growing pains is a fast and furious platformer which gives the genre a shake up with psychedelic graphics, a thumping soundtrack and an ingenious twist. The &quot;Vessel&quot; continually grows and expands leaving you in a permanent race to escape the area before you find your butt wedged in a tight spot.",

            "review_text": "This game could be incredible if it was more fleshed out. The concept is lovely, and the character handles tightly, but having solid mechanics is not enough for me to recommend it.  I try to only purchase games with aesthetics that really appeal me, so I have no idea why I thought Growing Pains was a good idea (heck, even the font is corny). The rudimentary graphics made me wonder why this isn't just a broswer Flash game. The 'particles' from the lasers and glow sticks are really nice, which is quite incongruent with the lack of details everywhere else. I feel that the developers could make it work quite easily by adding touches here and there.  The game only contains nine levels, and that's so inadequate for a paid game! Though there are ten other user levels, the base game is simply not meaty enough.  Simply put: there are many more platformers that deserve one's attention.",
