Now lets go to thethings i would personally like to see be added:  Currency:You get it throughout the map in the from of coins/shards and it is used for trading in a Yeti shop for new boards,cosmetics,single-use powerups for better scores or even map packs with a bunch of cool stages.  Wildlife:Animals like bears or penguins running around making you fail if you bump into them  Boss-type stages:A giant yeti chases you with a snowboard and you have to outrun it and finish before it catches you/Escape an avalance or types of stages like that.  Thank you mod for making this awesome game and i hope you consider my ideas worthy of using.Keep up te great work",

            "review_text": "Ugh. Like probably everyone else that bought this game or had it wishlisted, I was hoping for an SSX-type of game -- in my case for the open world racing, as I don't care about tricks. Unfortunately, with those expectations in mind, Mad Snowboarding ended up being a huge disappointment.  Note that I only played this for about half an hour, but it says something that by the end, playing to see what else this game offered was was quite a chore -- I would even characterize it as painful. I was bored out of my mind. In the levels I played, the world was very plain and dull. It isn't as 'open' as it looks, and I quickly ran into 'walls' when going not that far left or right. This is basically a really, really boring demo.  In my case, I bought this as a spare bundle key for about $0.20, so I'm not crying. But I would definitely encourage anyone wanting to pay full price to watch a lot of videos of this game and reading some of the more critical reviews before pulling the trigger.  Again, I only played half an hour, but half an hour into a game ... if it is that painfully boring, I find it hard to believe that the game would change dramatically after that. Maybe those creative types who enjoy designing stages and playing user-created levels will get more enjoyment out of it.  Seriously, why doesn't EA bring the SSX series to Steam? Even a port of an older SSX game will do. As it is, I suspect a lot of people will pick Mad Snowboarding up on sale to satisfy their SSX itch and end up disappointed.  1/10",
