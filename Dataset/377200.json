            "review_text": "DDG basically combines everything I remember about SNES platformers, and pulls it off with exceptional style. From the whips of Castlevania, the physics of Mario, the blaster from Mega Man, and some ideas from other more modern games, this game encapsulates a lot of different styles in gameplay. Despite all of the items that change the gameplay in interesting ways, the game works as a whole, and feels tight to control. The Xbox 360 controller I used felt perfect for the game, and the simple controls allowed me to jump in. Every time, I started to feel tired of a concept, the game would throw something else interesting at me.  Aside from the gameplay, there are a few other important facets to the game. First is the visual/story style. The game is set in a premise and style that I have not seen in a commercial game before. It doesn't take itself seriously, but still manages to fit an interesting little story in, and some well-formed characters. These elements aren't intrusive, but they are memorable enough to make the game stand out from the crowd.  The difficulty curve is excellent. The game speaks of its own difficulty, and it delivers, but not at first. The game builds you up to the more difficult segments later in the game. To add to the difficulty, there are four different characters to beat each level with, three challenging paintings to find, and a scoring system that drives the replayability of the game. All of this is optional, but the game can last a long time if the player desires it.  The boss levels in the game are excellent. That's all I need to say.  Downsides of the game: A few levels have a slightly frustrating design. That's basically the only downside I found to the game. It is definitely worth a play!  Note: I am quite far into the game, but have not completed it yet.",
