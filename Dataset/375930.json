Which is very annoyng since I can't blame it for being crap at it lol. Your main goal in each level is to grab all the available gems/jewels and reach the exit, but the puzzles the enemies, the traps...does not make the goal easy to attain, at all. There are levels in the tutorial which I had to play MANY times to finish them. Mind you I am not good at puzzle games, but my oh my did this game kick my ♥♥♥ lol.  Here is about half an hour of the game.          YouTube™ Video:  Trap Them, At A Glance&nbsp;",
