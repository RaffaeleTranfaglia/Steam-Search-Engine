            "review_text": "Buying this app you will actually buy support(but it doesn't work, spoilers, sorry) for previous app, because there are not many changes between them -- devs added some useless fancy UI. Reduce lagging on game is still in beta and they increased cap for framerate that anyway noone will use. Will test further with games I was not able to record or reported bugs for previous version of this software and add here if anything changed.  Its just frustrating.  Edit: 1. it seems they fixed double-cursor problem. Previously when recording an area in some games you may see two cursors recorded. I found this fixed when trying Galcon Fusion game. 2. Big fix comparingly to previous version(it would not exist if previous version was done properly) is that in case of game crash video file will not be broken and liteCam 5 usually properly stops recording.  PS.: Some time ago I've bought D3DGear and it completely satisfies me except it sometimes cannot record old games -- I must admit, liteCam might be handy with such games(tried to record Legacy of Kain series). Also recently I've tried their streaming capabilities with livecoding.tv(desktop recording) and it didn't work at all. Also there are not much of streaming configuration options if compare to other, even free tools.",
