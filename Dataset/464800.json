It tosses the cash shop in your face all the time, and it does not refill energy while you're offline so it's not even worth it to play more than once.",

            "review_text": "Looked like a nice HOG/Puzzler game, but I was wrong.  I'm familiar with the P2W concept of F2P HOGs, but this is just horrendus - you're just thrust into a year with a random fact given at the end of each scene[searching for letters/symbols] and after a few you're expected to remember the year of an event for an occasional quiz.  The mini-games feel so out of place, the flower system is sloppy + lazy, and the game feels quite claustrophobic since everything is done from one menu besides the obvious HO scenes.   The one thing I do commend this game on is the fact that some objects are hidden cleverly requiring closer inspection to discover; however, locations never change disappointingly, but they do try to offset this by adding new things after each scene.  13 Scenes x2 for the fantasy level[which I don't even understand], level 35 required for all scenes to unlock, 4 puzzles, collections, crystal runes, random facts/theories on a year, and you've got this game.",
