            "review_text": "A round of Half Dead only takes a few minutes to win or lose. The game has a very simple concept, but it is also pretty fun if you play with a group of friends. You're stuck somewhere in a grid of adjacent rooms. One room somewhere in the grid at a location unknown to you contains an exit. The rest of the rooms contain a surprise that is usually unpleasant. A small number of rooms are safe, most have traps that may kill you if you're not careful, and a few will kill you no matter what you do if you enter. One very interesting mechanic is that you can throw one of your shoes into a room to see if it triggers any traps, but when you're out of shoes, you never know which room may be your last. This leads to very interesting discussions in group chat about finding new pairs of shoes.  The different game modes do very little to add replayability. We were playing on the hardest difficulty setting and still managed to successfully reach the exit in nearly every game. The game is fun for a few hours, but I don't see myself coming back to it unless everyone else in my group wants to try it again.  Don't buy this game if you intend to play solo. It's really only enjoyable if you have a group of friends willing to risk life and limb together in a deadly race to the finish.",

            "review_text": "More like half complete!  The concept of navigating through a futuristic maze filled with deadly traps, while not new, is fun and simple.  Initally Half Dead has the ingredients for a great game, however after 20 minutes you'll have seen everything the game has to offer. All 15 of the traps will seem boring, repeditive and you'll just wish the damn doors would open faster. The enemy 'monsters' are particularly pitiful.  If you're going to base a game around random encounters there needs to have enough randomisation and player mechanics to keep it interesting. Considering the entire game is just one duplicated room, there's no real excuse for being so lazy about this.  Overall the game feels very half finished, like they had the bare bones of a game and figured that was enough to release it. Its a shame because I think with more work this game could be quite popular.  For many it's probably worth grabbing for its low cost, and even I'm not going to refund this game as this game might be fun to show friends for a quick laugh. But I can't rightfully recommend it for the reasons I've given.  I would love to see the developers add more content, steam workshop added or another game building upon this concept further.  Update- While steam workshop has been released, until more traps are added my review is still current.",

This person is a sweet, innocent soul with a deep yet misunderstood love for shoes. You start off free to roam around and explore the institution that surrounds you. At first you are content, all you wish is to enjoy a peaceable life, but life is hardly what it seems. Soon you will find there are hard decisions concerning love and sacrifice to be made. What will you do? Will you sacrifice yourself? Or will you put your life above all else? I will not spoil it but suffice it to say that you will run the gamut of emotions. You will laugh till it hurts and you will weep bitterly. The choices are tough but the experience is profoundly rewarding. This incredibly rich story has it all!",

            "review_text": "I would love to give a balanced review, but since that´s impossible I decided to do a negative one.   But why?  Half Dead is basically made for coop-multiplayer, I guess... Bacause on singleplayer mode it´s pretty boring after some time spent. The idea itself is neither bad nor innovative, you are just told to go through rooms until you find the 'exit', which is a green button on the ground... Yea, that´s it. Randomly generated rooms, with or without traps. Starts off pretty interesting but after a while it´s just repetive. Couldn´t play multiplayer so far, it´s probably pretty fun to play with good friends. Although this can be somewhat frustrating I wouldn´t call it a 'challenge', since the rooms are RANDOMLY PLACED. Sound is allright, only the chainsaw dude is a little annoying.   But now for some other aspects:   The graphics are pretty neat, at least the VFX. The characters look pretty much awkward against that, asking me. The dying scenes are just hilarious, everytime you die, no matter how, you are just torn into red pieces. On the other hand the surroundings look quite good. And according to this costs 1,99$; it´s a very fair deal, for this price this is absolutely okay. One last thing that disturbs me are the achievements. They look somewhat out of place, they could have been more meaningful. You are just getting them by playing... 'Discover XXX Rooms'; 'Find XXX Traps'... Nothing else.   So that´s what I had to admit. If you have some friends to play Half Dead with this will be fun for a few hours, probably not more. If you want some singleplayer action, I would refuse this on your spot. But still, for such a low price you can´t get so wrong.",

            "review_text": "This is maybe kind of interesting for an hour until you've encountered all the trap types, and then there's really no reason to keep playing it. You just wander around a randomly generated grid of rooms, many of which contain one or two of a dozen or so different types of traps. You can throw your shoe into a room to see if it sets off a trap, or otherwise run into the room and hope for the best. There's a little strategy to it, but it isn't a deep game and gets old quickly. The price is about right for the tiny amount of content, but I don't feel it's engaging enough to even be worth spending $2 on.  Also, this game is terribly optimized. Runs like ♥♥♥♥ on my laptop with an i7 and GeForce 840M - not a killer gaming rig, but it should be more than enough for a game with this little going on. Also, this game has the most lens flare out of anything that has ever been made. JJ Abrams wets his pants a little every time he sees it.",

A much more enjoyable experience with friends, however it is also fun if playing with random people online or entirely by yourself. There are multiple different game modes to choose from as well: some include time-limited games, where you have to find the exit within a certain amount of time, as well as there being a competitive game mode where the first team (out of 2 teams) to find the exit wins. Of course this is all on top of the regular 'spend however long you want, with whoever you want, trying to find the exit to the maze' style of game.  The graphics and lighting are absolutely beautiful for a £1.59 game, and it runs very smoothly on high-end PC's - however, an optimisation update is probably in order for people with rigs lower down the spectrum.  My only 'complaint' with this game is that there are currently fairly few different types of traps, and after playing the game for about 1 hour you will see just about all there is to see (in terms of traps). Nevertheless, it is still a very enjoyable experience that you can spend hours on.",

General note: Half-dead is a cheap game which is honestly just fun. I'd say as much fun as you'd expect from a 2.19$ game but what it lacks in variety it makes up for in concept.  Gameplay: You run around rooms which are colour coded to tell you how many traps are around you (if you're colour blind you may have a problem) your objective is to find the exit in a game where moving into a certain room can mean certain death. Of course, there are different kinds of traps, some which you can survive if you move quickly and some which will trap and kill you.  Graphics: Think Gmod but slightly flashier, character models are reused a lot but there is a workshop to help fix that. But overall, it's a 2.19$ game. What do you expect?  Sound: Eh, music is alright. Not Undertale but not bad.  Multiplayer: With the price of this game I was afraid that the lobby system might work on VAC or even worse with that crappy IP thing that Terraria had. But the lobby was easy to set up and even easier to join. No real glitches from the looks of it in the lobby system but of course, this is why I'm not paid to find glitches in games.  Overall: If you have 2.19$ and you want a quick cheap game to play with friends then go ahead and buy it. It's fun, it's simplistic, it's good. Keep in mind that it's a 2.19$ and enjoy the change of pace from what most big video games have right now.",
