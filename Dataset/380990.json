            "review_text": "This is my honest, unbiased oppinion about this game:  This is in no way a GOOD game, however it's NOT a BAD game either. I got this on sale at a reduced price so i think i only payed little over a buck for this, but for a buk and change, you get what you pay for. It's a poor man's 'Cybernator' or 'Assault Suit Leyons' there are some good levels that are fun to play, but then there are the 'omfg this is straight up unforgivable' levels where the game gets frustrating because of the clunky controls.  I'd recommend it to anyone who likes old games like Cybernator or Attack on Leyons way back in the days of old as this game feels like nostalgia bait. Fun, but not fun at times, but not enough where I feel as though I should return it.",
