            "review_text": "Before I begin: I'm not talking about plot at all as it's a quirky, weird experience with a pretty interesting story.  The easiest way I can describe this game is 'Clue meets Professor Layton'. Everything about this title is charming - the dialogue is humorous and moves the storylines along, the puzzles require a bit of dumb luck but once you dig through the game and find them all the setting feels pretty robust.  The gameplay is split into two components: 'Investigation' and Conversing. Through investigating the setting and speaking to characters who inhabit the space with you, you gain mastery and experience on a handful of intersecting plotlines. The conversing 'mini-game' is almost like playing three games of Rock-Paper-Scissors at once. Each step you take towards defeating your opponent results in a different 'stat' losing some of it's power. These different tiers are set atop an actual game of R-P-S... so starting out it seems more complicated than it is.  The only negative comment I'd say regarding this fun game is because of how the gameplay is configured there is quite a bit of repetition both in investigating, purchasing items, and winning conversations. This is relatively minor due to the short length of the title (and I was playing to 100%, which I hit around 10 hours).  It's pretty remarkable for how polished this game is in it's current state given the small staff. I hope we see more in this Tale of Last Words!",

            "review_text": "Really enjoyed this game. A quirky little JRPG style mystery story. The music is great and I enjoyed the character designs. The battle system was pretty easy to learn but tough to master, especially against opponents with special abilities. Unfortunately, since there are so few characters in the game, if you want to experience everything you'll be doing grindy battles against the same 3 or 4 people quite a bit.  There's a lot to investigate and uncover here, so if you don't want reading in your RPGs this isn't the game for you. I really appreciated the little marker to tell you which characters you had already talked to about which topic, so it was easy to figure out who you'd missed.  If you're looking for something unique and interesting, give Last Word a go.  (Editing this to nominate it for the write-in at the steam awards)",

I got this game on a whim and I really enjoyed it as the characters are all very different and interesting, the music is really nice, and the story over all is pretty great.  I marathoned this game and I enjoyed it the entire time especially with it's different gaming style.  My only complaints are that I wish the instructions explaining the battle mechanics were a little more clear as it took me a while to figure them out and that the game is way too short, as everything moves along way too fast.  I'm kind of sad that I completed the game and got all the achievements and secrets more because I really want more time with these characters.  The New Game + Feature is also really nice though it did make trying to get stored EXP pretty useless for me.",

And of course, it's all about power. I like the style on the game and the sounds on it way more than normally; it's pretty chill, and of course, simple.   The game is about you being at a mansion 'party', where you have to talk to people. Pretty much the concept. And you 'fight' the people by using your speach skills. For each chatting etc. you gain levels and unlock special topics and such.   I don't know why I didn't like Undertale at all, but I like this way more. Sort of the same concept and idea, but the art styles, sounds and 'fighting' is so much better.   I do recommend this.",

Through use of Disruptive, Subtle, Aggressive speech and it's a tug of war battle to be victorious!  Graphics are really well done from the maps to the unique silhouette characters. This game kind of plays like a mystery RPG game which is really pleasing. Not sold on paying $10... But it would be close considering this is one of the best RPG maker games I've played to this point.   Worth $5-8 if you dig good RPG maker games... Usually in bundles or on sale cheaper!

The gameplay is split between engaging in well written dialogue with the NPCs, and fighting those same NPCs with conversation based combat. Combat is a fun, tug of war like battle that uses abstracted conversation tactics to win arguments with your opponent. Yes, the game is all about talking, and if a game about talking sounds boring, this might not be the game for you. The story is short, but I found it just long enough to be fun without the combat feeling repetitive. If there's a sequel, and I hope there is, I'd like to see more variety with conversation types and tactics. Overall, a unique idea with an entertaining execution.",

It looks like your typical turn based rpg, that's set inside a single mansion, but it's not quite what you expect.  Basically there's two parts of the gameplay. The first part is investigating topics by talking to other guests that's locked in the mansion with you. You investigate and gather informations about key topics and you use it to move the story forward.  The second part, that is the meat of the game, is the discourse, the battle system. In this game, conversation is serious business, and having the last word can give you literal domination toward your discourse partner.  It's basically one-on-one turn-based rpg battle. But you don't take turn stabbing each others with swords of course. You take turn in abstract discussions, and try to gain the last word.  You have choices on what to do. You throw disruptive remark to mostly gain power. You can throw submissive remark to trade your power with tact, and finally you can throw agressive remark to actually move the conversation toward your end. Other than that there are things you must consider, like your and your opponent's composure, which is basically your defenses, the tone of conversation (tones have paper-rock-scissors relationship, and they have different effects or can destroy your opponent's composure), and of course various personal skills everyone have.  Basically, a pretty charming and stylistic twist on typical turn-based rpg.",

It feels like a mix between rock, paper, scissors, phoenix wright, and clue all wrapped up into a mystery rpg. the main problem in this game is the INCESSANT amount of grinding you have to do. I spent over an hour grinding to fight the 2nd boss. The plot line if you go out of your way for every line actually goes ahead and gives you a fairly complex story, from Gawship house defunking, Seymour's mother running off with Prattle's son. Among many other more deep plot points.   Overall if you are looking for something different this is a shoe in. If you are a fan of old turn-based rpgs in the likes of Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest you might want to look elsewhere.",

            "review_text": "This game was a pretty good time-killer. It was quirky, entretaining, and different. It is roughly divided into two phases, an investigation phase which is more passive, and a battle phase where you are more actively engaged.  The investigation phase doesn't have anything very special, you basically chat with people and gossip about different topics, leveling up your knowledge on these topics and getting to know more about the cast. While its nothing special, it's not unrewarding as most of the times you will get experience by discovering all sorts of events. The conversations can be pretty entretaining, and there are a few secrets here and there,   The 'battles' are kind of weird, and the tutorial is not the best (long text thrown at you explaining things, instead of showing it to you). Therefore, you learn mostly through trial and error. The first battle, usually used as a tutorial, is 'wasted' as you are forced to lose on the first turn (granted, it's meant to show how bad you are at first, but still, it doesn't feel fair to be thrown into a battle that you will lose for certain, without even knowing what is even going on). Instead, you get the second battle to be the tutorial. As i've stated, you are told in text all in one go how battles work, and you have to remember how it all works from the start. Maybe if in the first battle you could have two turns or more to try things out before you are inevitably beaten, or maybe if you got the tutorial commands one turn at a time, it would be less confusing.  While the presentation of the battles might not have been ideal, they are very engaging, especially compared to other turn based RPGs. In the 'investigation' phase you are more passive and allowed to rest for a bit. In the 'battle' phase, you will find yourself thinking ahead all the time, and being extra attentive to every aspect of it. A mistake might cost you the match, and it makes it a very engaging kind of fight. The battles are like playing a two games of Rock-Paper-Scissors, in which you have to choose between three types of moves (increase power-increase tact-attack), between three types of each move (low,medium,strong) and betweeen a sort of elements which affect how much damage the enemy/you take (circle-square-star).  While the game does become kind of repetitive after a while, the fact that it is fairly short, and that you get several skills to make battles different, makes up for it. The main problem will arise if you are trying to reach max level for some reason.  The last gripe, would be that there are two things that if you miss (checking a wine bottle before a certain development, and sitting on a chair in every chapter) you won't be able to get 100%, which is kind of annoying without a 'new game+' or a 'start certain chapter' feature.  I had a pretty good time, it still has room for improvement but it is a very solid game.",
