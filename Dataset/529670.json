            "review_text": "This is true horror, but I can't tell you about the actual game.  This may be a fantastic game, but I couldn't play for more than 10 minutes. The movement options are instantly nausea-inducing for me. There is no blink/teleport movement option. The best form of locomotion (I use the word 'best' very loosely) was a type where you slide along by using the trackpad. The word 'vomitorium' comes to mind. The other two movement options  may possibly  have been slightly better for nausea, but they weren't nearly as natural feeling (not that sliding is 'natural' either, but it's more intuitive than the other two options). I would definitely prefer some sort of micro-teleport.  Another nausea-inducing element is when you come into contact with the walls (very easy to do, given the lack of precise movement options), everything blurs and you are pushed backwards such that you don't clip through. A second helping of nausea for the gentleman?  If the developers or community manager would care to reply to this when there are non-nauseous movement options, then I will definitely give it another try. Until then, I give this two vomit-spattered thumbs down.",

            "review_text": "I just couldn't bring myself to give this game a thumbs up. A lot of people were raving about how scary it was and I've never tried a VR horror game yet, so thought I'd give it a whirl. To start I'll give praise for the multiple locomotion options, props for that! My favourite was armswinger as it feels the most natural of the 3. Walking through the door the environment did glitch and put me in the top of the door which was a bit disorientating.  My main gripe with the game is that it's far too dark. I know I know, it's a horror game, it's supposed to be dark, but when the Vive has horrible SDE in black/very dark scenes, this totally breaks immersion, which then makes the game not scary anymore. I think this is why I didn't feel any of it was scary until the ending, which did make me jump a little bit, but only a little bit. Other negatives include, not being able to interact with anything. Interaction increases immersion! I had hands that could close, but I couldn't grab anything, or move anything. The best part of the game for me was after the ending where everything was floating in the room, that bit was kind of cool, but when the best bit is after the game ends, it's not a great sign. I really wanted this to be good, but unfortunately for me, it just wasn't. It needs a lot of work and a hell of a lot of polish to make it into a game that could sell. Overall a disappointing first horror VR experience, which was a shame.",
