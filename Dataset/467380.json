Our main character Chimera is increadibly versatile. She can dash (which also hurts enemies) , air dash (infinite airdash YEAAAAHHHHHH!!!!!) , pougo jump using her arm and thats not even counting the weapons you get from enemies. Its more like Zero (from megaman games) actually. You dont really get a weapon but a new move or an upgrade to your normal abilities.  The writing is hilarious. I love the every single character in this game even the normal enemies. You can even talk to the checkpoints. The bosses are really fun (albeit a bit easy) , the music is catch as all hell, the level design is rich , and its just overall an amazing game. I can't believe its free. I mean seriously why is this game free?!?!  If you are a fan of Megaman , Shovel Knight , Ducktales or anything in this genre please try this game (its free anyway). Its not a great game for a free title no its a great game in general.",

Would definitely be worth 5 bucks if it was pay to play.",

            "review_text": "First of all, I love monstergirls. So I was happy to find out this game exists, and happier to find out it's both free and fun. The game is clearly and proudly based off the megaman platform games. Like the megaman games, you make your way through themed stages, each with thier own set of enemies and hazrds that get harder the further you get into the stage before you face a boss and defeat them for a new power like having a double jump, or a charge shot. The game itself is also much more forgiving then most old school platformers. The stages themselves can be tricky, the pirate ship ones having lots of traps that need good timing to avoid. But the bosses are all easy. They leave themselves open for long periods which means rushing in and smashing them in the face is the way to go. The only boss to put up a challenge is the last stage of the final boss, and that's more due to the moving platfroms and the spikes you have to deal with. The game is short, but that's to be expected when it's free. There is stuff to do after you beat all the stages. you can find fairies and books hidden in the stages, and retry for A ranks and Deathless and Beserk runs.",

Controls take a bit of getting used to at the beginning and the difficulty curve is a bit wonky at the beginning (depending on where the player starts at) but overall this is a massively enjoyable free game. I highly recommend downloading and playing it.",

I was shocked by just how much thought and creativity went into each character in the game. Everyone in this game has a distinct personality, making the world seem vibrant and alive. It has been a very long time since I have spent more time running around the HUB world talking to the npcs than actually playing the game. As for the soundtrack, I haven't heard toons as catchy as this since Undertale. While the combat system in this game is a little rough at times, it certainly gets the job done. I give this game two ensusiastic thumbs up. I'd give it more, but sadly I only have two thumbs.",

This game totally caught me off-guard and came out of nowhere to be one of the most fun games I've played all year. So cool!  PROS: ---------------------------- - Large, fun levels with lots of variety in the gameplay. (The levels kept introducing new mechanics to kept things interesting.) Very well done. - Considerable length (aka -- it's not too short). I took 10 hours to beat the game! (I like to look for secrets ^_^ ) - Great characters and dialogue. The charming characters and funny dialogue kept me smiling. I kept being surprised at how well the characters -- and there are a LOT of them -- were fleshed out. There's a whole world of character development here! - Great music! I often found myself humming the Oil Level's music as I fell asleep. Great stuff!  - Lots of collectibles! This is a big one for me. I love games that reward exploration and this one rewards it in spades. Lots of cool secrets and hidden collectible to find. Love it! - Cute story with memorable characters. This kind of goes along with the third point. Just really well done. - One of the best compliments I can give is that I found the gameplay very compelling. Once I started, I just had to keep playing to see where it went. Just lots of fun. :) - It's free. Yup -- this costs a grand total of $0. I would've gladly paid $9.99 for a game like this -- but here it is, free. (It's so good that I had to buy the 'Doctor's Assisstant' DLC just so I could give the dev *something*. I mean, come on! It's really good! &gt;_&lt;)  CONS: ---------------------------------------- - These are more nitpicks than anything else. I think towards the end of the game I saw one grammatical mistake. - For a while, I thought one jump in the Oil Level (to get to a secret location), was a little too high. (Turns out I wasn't jumping properly -- so maybe that's on me). - I can't really think of anything else. &gt;_&lt;  OVERALL: --------------------------------------- 'Khimera: Destroy All Monster Girls' truly is an excellent game. Others have compared it to 'Shovel Knight' in terms of gameplay, tone and scale -- and I think that's a fair comparison. It really is well done and highly recommended. If you're a fan of platformers (or games full of fun characters), I highly recommend checking it out. Also -- it's free!  FINAL SCORE: --------------------------------------- 9.5 out of 10",

FREE to play, great level design, controls, music, and humor make this game great to play. (Humor really reminded of Shantae) If you're the type that finds great replay value in speedrunning, you'll love it. The main game can be pretty short, but you have two different trial/race modes to play, hidden secrets and collectables to find, and trying to max out your scores by collecting all the gems (similar to Shovel Knight's treasure) and perfecting levels. Speaking of speedrunning, the dev is always checking in with the speedrun community. THE DEV IS LISTENING!  I've put in almost 30 hours trying to perfect my runs BEFORE some good updates, and I can definitely see myself putting in more because of how wonderful this game FEELS.  Youve got nothing to lose by playing this game, and the only con I can think of is that the art style may not be to your taste (really not a big deal).",
