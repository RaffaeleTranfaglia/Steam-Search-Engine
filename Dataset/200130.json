            "review_text": "The first Puzzler World was better in my opinion as far as the interface goes. This one made some unnecessary changes that only served to lessen the quality of the sequel.  The new link-a-pix is a lot more annoying especially since you have to drag the screen around to find the corners of the puzzle. I'm not sure why they decided it was a good idea. They could have just as easily added in a zoom function.  They removed codewords and added 2 other types of puzzles to replace it. Why was it removed to begin with?  Aside from the 2 things I pointed out, the game is pretty much the same. It goes on sale often so it's a nice little purchase that can entertain you anywhere between 5-20 hours depending on your enthusiasm for puzzles both easy and challenging.",

Some new gamemodes are added like Fit Word which is a drag and drop Crosswords , or one like a Crosswords reverse. There are also little graphical changes. Now you earn your hintpoints after a solved puzzle on a wheel of fortune. The biggest lack of this game is that it is only in english. Very hard for people outside the UK to solve some crosswords for example. Thats the reason I must invest lots of hint points into unknown expressions. But some of the old game modes and the mathematics riddles are still fun.",

The puzzles themselves are of middling difficulty (which I suppose means the game isn't for you, if you're looking for a challenge). If you, like me, aren't very good at sudoku or crosswords (or any of the other types of puzzles offered), it's possible to end up frustrated. The Link-a-pix needs a scroll feature, but that aside, I find the games soothing, and play this when I need to unwind.",

There are a variety of puzzles, so if you're not a fan of one type, it's not a problem. 500 puzzles in total, so there is a lot of content to get through. Lots of ingame achievements, too. The only real problem I have is that there are no instructions. With puzzles like crossword or sodoku, this is no problem. With backwards and link a pix, however I needed a little instruction to figure them out. Aside from a few minor quirks, it's a nice game for the price if you're a fan of logic puzzles.",

            "review_text": "I had issues with the first game, enough to put it into the 'not recommended' category, but was still able to put up with it enough to play the puzzles. The same cannot be said of the second game, which is readily apparent as being far inferior in quality. If a good game were equivalent to Ghostbusters, the first game was Batman Forever -- not good, but with enough redeeming values to be enjoyed. Puzzler World 2, however, is more on the level of Manos: The Hands of Fate; on several levels it doesn't just fall short of its goals, it fails to even be recognizable as making a worthwhile attempt.  The issues of the first game not only remain, they are exacerbated. The 'picture quiz' game, which has absolutely no business being in a puzzle publication on account of not being a puzzle (memorizing isn't problem solving), remains, as does the kindergarten-level Silhouette. Codeword, one of the more creative and intelligent games of the original, is removed. Hangman is still set at a level that is too easy for anybody who can read at a first grade level. The maximum number of wrong guesses one should be able to get in Hangman is 6, a quarter of the alphabet. PW2 allows eleven wrong guesses. Another irritation from the first game, that being crossword answers that have multiple viable spellings not being accepted (and not being blocked because it doesn't completely interlink the way a proper crossword should) also continues here... along with some clues just being wrong, at least by American definitions. ('Mooch' does not mean 'skulk'; it means 'freeload'.)  Still, issues of the puzzles' difficulty levels would be minor complaints on their own. What sinks this from a C average all the way to an uncontested F is the interface. There are numerous design changes in this version that are just baffling. The 'hint token' prize boxes of the first game -- mildly annoying on their own -- are replaced by a 'Wheel of Fortune' spinner, complete with requirement that you spin it with sufficient speed (remember, this is a puzzle game, not a skill game). The Fitword puzzle now requires that the words be manually dragged into their places rather than typed. The 'Sum Up' puzzle has the answers floating around aimlessly for no reason other than to make it harder to see what you're trying to click on; the actual problem solving isn't made any more difficult, it's just the physical aspect that's made irritating. The crossword puzzles skip over filled in letters while you're typing -- so for example, if you already have the 'N' in from another word, you can't type 'ORANGE', you have to type 'ORAGE'. Worst of all, the Link-A-Pix puzzles, the most fun game from the original, are rendered completely unplayable by a decision to require the user to scroll around the screen instead of showing the full puzzle.  As if these bad design decisions weren't enough, the game is also severely buggy. There's visible lag in response times, items don't always line up the way they should (the word search lines are often off-center), and worst of all, a lot of it just doesn't work. Scrolling in Challenge Mode can't be done with the mouse, but only with the keyboard. The scrolling in Master Mode and the Trophy Room don't even work with that. There are arrows there, but you can't click on them, you can't spin the mouse wheel, and you can't use the arrow keys. You're told there's stuff to scroll to, but you can't scroll to it. And to top it all off, there doesn't appear to be a 'QUIT' button for the program. I had to use Task Manager to shut this piece of crap down. I won't be starting it up again.",

PW2 is just a reskin, with added annoyances, for instance making selectables floating around instead of standing still, etc. And some differences in some games doesn't make sense and isn't covered in the instructions, so you have to either experiment to make out the rules, or just blindly guess.  Other annoyances really confused me a bit, until I figured out what the heck was going on, mainly link-a-pix: it may appear to not having all the pairs - this is because it doesn't show the whole playfield, it's zoomed in on just a part of it.  They tried to make it different, but took away the fun in the process. I have rarely been so disappointed with any game before.  Avoid PW2 like the plague, go play the first game instead.",

            "review_text": "(05/10) - At Least Playable  Well, what should i say about this? If you like crossword-puzzles, hang man and co. there is very much to find in here. My absolute favourite was something i didn´t even know before, and the 'find the error' and sudoku puzzles are fun as well. You get a ton of content, and with the master puzzles you can easily rap your head around one puzzle for hours.  A slight warning tho, puzzles where you have to find or insert words (just like crosswords for example) are rather impossible without a native tongue in english. I´d say that i speak it quite well and i didn´t finish any of those puzzles, as the necessary words are just unknown without a perfect knowlage of the english language...",
