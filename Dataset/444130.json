            "review_text": "  Auralux: Constellations is a great game for pure relax :) I was involved in beta-testing of the game and I can say with pleasure it's a very good game :) The main principle is to win by taking over enemy suns with units produced by suns that you owned so far. This version of game is a great enhacement of the original Auralux. It's introduced so many new features like black-holes, minefield zones, moving suns etc. - just brilliant! :) There is a lot of fun for a long hours in many different star constellations. This version has multiplayer and in-game chat as well, so even more fun and hours are ensured. Also the game is very nice looking, however it could be more interesting music provided. As for me this game is definitely worth to play it! :)",

            "review_text": "This game is simple. Don't let that decieve you into thinking it's easy or boring at all. If you like strategy but dont want all the extra (and cookie-cutter from game to game) monotonus steps of building all of the huts and farms and bunkers, this game is perfect.   Everyone starts out with the same initial units and has the same rate of production that constantly churns out your units, you only get stronger by sending units to take other planets, or investing them in upgrading select planets (plus a few strategic mode options) Simple.So much so that the single player mode can feel easy to complete at FIRST. Then you get to the 'insane' levels. These are very challenging maps that will require thinking outside of the box (or obit?!?!?) to complete. I have played this on the mobile app and have beaten all but 3 of the maps and those three are keeping me insanely playing this game trying to beat them!   The part about this game that i've enjoyed the most is the multiplayer, which VERY sadly needs more of you to realize how awesome this game is. The strategies you've learned to manipulate and win against the AI of single player now go out the window and all of the excitement is renewed!!!!... as long as there's actually somone on to play.... Seriously, there is so much potential here that hasn't been discovered that my eyes are watering a little bit as I type this. Check it out!!!!!",
