Theres open PvP as well as something called Arena war's which have different mods for example they have an arched mode whereeveryone has to throw engy balls at one another, some arena games have a max level so people who are higher can still play but are reduced to that max level, ive bought preium so i can level up fast and it works rather well, have to see what else prem can do yet. but all in all it's a below avg game,Stupidly shocking graphics, but by far the best community i've seen on any game, Very helpful vets of the game. so if you're looking for a chilled out game this would be it",

Can be multiple players in dungeon. Has a retro look and old school gameplay, is a ten year old game. Has multiple classes, but each character is a separate account. Try it, if you like older games.

The simple retro RPG style is amazing, there is slight room for improvement like when you walk into a wall it sometimes glitches but the game is like 2 days old so what can i say. Utterly amazing, hit the nail right on the head, this is amazing and i will probably buy the Premier Edition because i love this so much. I recomend to anyone who likes grinding games and dungeon crawlers. Overall great game. 10/10.",

Kinda reminds me of Runescape Classic as well haha.",
