            "review_text": "One of the most enjoyable co-op experiences I've had. Great puzzles, beautiful art style, cute characters, good music. Get a whole lot of mileage out of a handful of simple gameplay mechanics. You'll find yourself screaming in frustration, shouting and pumping your fist in triumph, erupting in cathartic laughter as it finally seems you and your friend will accomplish the intricate, difficult procedure you've spent so long figuring out and attempting, only to see your friend make a stupid mistake and ruin everything at the last second.  The game only lets you communicate with your online parter by drawing blobby, imprecise lines onscreen. This could be seen as a drawback, but in fact it becomes its own meta-puzzle: how do I explain this detailed series of actions that will involve precise timing, without using any words? You come to develop a rudimentary syntax; you start saying yes and no by moving back and forth and jumping up and down, respectively, or you draw frantic scribbles on the screen to indicate frustration. It's so much more satisfying to solve puzzles this way; you really feel like you've accomplished something beyond the game itself. Of course there are also those infuriating moments when you give up trying to use the in-game language and resort to Steam chat, or even make a phone call and talk through it in real time. And then there are transcendent moments when you and your partner both know exactly what to do without attempting any communication at all.   It's also great fun to be a jerk and push your partner over cliffs or into enemies.   If I have only one criticism it's that if you're playing with more than one friend (say, one online and one IRL) there's no reliable way to keep track of which levels you've finished with each friend. Like, I beat the game with friend A while I was only a few levels in with friend B, and then I'd start up the game with friend B and some of the puzzles would start to seem mighty familiar, and I couldn't be sure if it was only because I'd already played them with friend A, or because I'd also already played them with friend B. You can reset ALL of your progress, which would have made it easier to kow where I was with friend B if I'd started with them AFTER beating the game with friend A, but I had two games going at the same time so deleting my progress with friend A would have deleted the friend B's progress as well, and it wouldn't have been fair to friend A, either, if we ever decided we wanted to go back and try to get all the crystals on certain levels without replaying all the others. The option for separate play 'sessions' could have solved this (I always thought having three save slots in the Zelda games was overkill, but now I see the reasoning behind it). But, lengthy complaint notwithstanding, this is really a minor problem.  I was lucky enough to get this in a double pack as part of a bundle, but It's definitely worth the full price.",

They also use very frequent mini check points, so you don't have to start a whole level over. ... But then it digresses into really tricky timing platforming with multiple challenging tasks in timed sequenses and the fun sort of drains off to exaspiration. Put another way, when you know how to solve a puzzle but they needlessly have easy to fail tight timing/positioning things that all have to be done as one continuous chain where either person can fail, and have to do it all over again. I think I'd rather play something else at that point.  If you really really love tricky platforming (both pricision/timing and intelectualy challenging), you may really like this game. I liked if for a short while and then hit a point where it felt like a chore and I didn't want to pick it up again.",

The world, but also the objects and living animals(?), look really beautiful.  The nice thing about this co-op is, that you really need each other. I'm not sure if it's even possible to play it alone.  Also, the hidden levels bring a really nice touch to the game.  The game is hard to play though, it's not easy, especially when you also want to complete the hidden levels, which are even harder than the normal game.  What I also like about this game, is that it is developped by two Dutch companies, which I like, because I am Dutch. But even without this I would defenitily recommend this game!  i would definitely recommend this game!!  Info about the badge and emoticons of the game (NOTE: this is not in the game itself, it costs extra money): Nice about the game, but not really interesting for most people, I guess, is that the game has really nice badges.. At least the level 5 badge and the foil badge. The level badges below 5 I forgot about, so not talking about those. Also, the game has really nice emoticons, that you could get when crafting the badges. Especially the emoticon: :pinkheart:. I had the heart quite some time, then I found out, it's actually Ibb and Obb combined in a heart. This heart is also the level 5 badge.",

In the very short time I have played it, I have found the game incredibly fluid and polished, the art and animation smooth and fitting to the core gameplay, and the gameplay itself fantastic. It's the kind of game you can pick up and play with a friend so easily, and then can't put down.  The puzzles start out seemingly easy, but continue to get trickier and trickier. The lack of communication besides what you can waggle out with your mouse only adds to the fun, and you'll probaby find yourself either laughing hysterically or screaming frustratedly as one of you grasps the puzzle while the other does not. I can imagine having an unskilled/trolling teammate would somewhat diminish this experience, but if you're in the right mindset, with the right teammate, you'll have a blast.  TL;DR: 9/10.

            "review_text": "So, I forget where I first read about this game. Probably somewhere in the vijagame jouranlisms. I really liked the visual aesthetic and the idea of a puzzle platformer built not just with co-op in mind, but built entirely around co-op as a necessary central mechanic. I ended up playing the first level and a half solo just to get a feel for the game, and came away with the impression that it was going to be a cute, clever, but ultimately soft experience.  That was quite some time ago. Recently got into it seriously with a friend, and damn, my initial impression was proven wrong. This game is certainly cute but it is anything but soft. ibb &amp; obb will challenge your brain meat. The semi-hidden bonus stages especially; they gave us several excellent opporutnities to flex our brain muscle and were always very satisfying to solve. Considering all your character can do is move and jump, it's amazing the depth of puzzles they're able to create with concepts like maintaining or building momentum or manipulating which direction gravity pulls your character.  The only basic mechanic you have other than moving and jumping is a little colorful bubble trail thing you can create with either the mouse or the right stick, if you're using a controller. It's the only communication tool you have in-game, and I was impressed with how much information we were able to convey to each other using this simple, visual medium. Of course sometimes we had to open a chat window to talk deeper strategy, but still it's an elegant solution for the issue of communication between players that fits in with the game's minimalist approach to it's mechanics and aesthetic.  I only have a couple negative points to share. The game starts out slow as you learn the mechanics and builds up the complexity on a pretty satisfying curve, but there are a couple challenges that boil down to basically challenges to your manual dexterity rather than your abilty to problem solve, and those are never as satsifying. Secondly, we played online and towards the end experienced some pretty bad lag, which the game was not always good at mitigating. We ended up with some weird lag artifacts like random enemies spawning in locations they shouldn't that only damaged one of the two players, or multiple copies of either ibb or obb respawning at once, or just really long wait times to respawn after death. Generally play was smooth and honestly you have to expect some problems when you play online over a crappy connection, but when the lag got particularly bad, the game had more trouble with it than I was expecting.  It's a relatively short game but there's so few games out there that are anything like it, and those few hours are densely packed. ibb &amp; obb is pure gameplay; there's no text or any exposition of any kind anywhere in the game. If you dig platformers and puzzlers and various combinations thereof, and you've got a friend with similar interests, there are certainly less engaging ways you could split $14. love that the 'Best Friends Forevr' double-pack only costs two dollars more than one copy on its own. If you buy the two-pack and split the cost with a friend, you're both basically getting the game 40% off. That's how strongly the developer believes in their vision of a 2-player co-op puzzle platformer.",

Communication is a large part of what I enjoyed in this game, since some tricks are really difficult and we had to join forces. Nicely made coop gameplay, also it has such neat graphic as screenshots show. And.. if you want, this can be played alone with both hands.",

If it wasn't for a particular puzzle, I could say each one is unique.  WARNING FOR ACHIEVEMENT ENTHUSIASTS: You must have an Xbox 360 controller in order to obtain all achievements!",

There is also a DISTINCT lack of button use. Sure the game is jump and that's it, but we had to restart a handful of levels simply because there's no die option. If you get stuck, too bad, restart the whole level. There is a series of levels in the dark where your visibility is limited.
