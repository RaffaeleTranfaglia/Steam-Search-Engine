            "review_text": "Far cry 3's best moments are also some of my best moments in gaming, I'll leave my love for this game aside and try be fair evaluating it's aspects. First of all, you can feel the Far cry 2 engine here, similar animations and gunplay, but its definitley improved.  Graphics are pretty, shaders could have been a little less saturated for a more realistic look, but its an art direction choice, still beautiful anyway! I found a few bugs, objects revealing geometry, shadows loading in a weird way and black textures appearing on roads whenever I was nearby, It breaks immersion but don't compromise the fun. Gameplay is fluid, animations are well made, guns feel powerful and there are plenty to choose from your loadout, you can craft boosts from herbs you harvest in the jungle, use a bow that add's a Hunter feel that we all love, and take a stealthy approach if that's your thing, that was something I wasn't sure it would work out well but It did, I finished the game using the knife and bow mostly. Performance is pretty fair, the game runs well if you have a good machine and still pretty even on medium specs, I played this with an GTS450 on medium and then maxed out with a 650ti Boost, running with 40fps most of the time. Story and characters are quite memorable, did I ever tell you the definition of good character design? you got it. After you finish the story you still have activities to complete, hunt &amp; assassination missions, outposts to clear, towers to climb and work your magic to unlock new weapons, it's a very rewarding game and it has lore on every item you acquire. I still have to try the co-op, if you're reading this maybe we should give it a try!?   tl;dr + Open world + Memorable story and characters + Gun customization and variety + Stealth is an option  + Replay value  + Burning weed with Skrillex™  - Minor graphic bugs sometimes - Requires Ubi-Launcher - DLC is Irrelevant and Skippable - Dead multiplayer",

I was more patient with far cry 2 and I enjoyed that game overall more than this game even though in many ways this has improved on fc2's most obvious annoyances though it does introduce some of its own. The game's key fights are decided by quicktime events... that was really lame but I'm really just nitpicking. There's so much stuff do in the game that it practically has something for everyone.

Will you open a cage to release a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ tiger on your enemies? Or will you sneak your way through? The choice is all yours.  The story is simple but feels alright, the characters are all pretty charismatic and have their own personalities; the game has humour and dramatic moments. It is beautiful and immersive. The gameplay is varied enough, and when you think it might become boring, new gameplay elements come in. Lots of missions and side-missions to keep you occupied for quite some time; I've played more than 16 hours when I'm writing this review and haven't even finished it yet. Take your time, do some missions, get lost in the jungle, plan your tactics and stop being a prey: be the predator. I only wish the stealth approaches would be more realistic like it was in Far Cry 2, and a better crafting system.  At first I didn't think I'd like this game, but now I love it.  A solid 8.5 or 9/10 for this piece of work.",

            "review_text": "7/10 -What a trip. I enjoyed hunting animals to craft items, Looting, finding relics and completing side missions to get money to upgrade and buy weapons, stealth killing, sniping from a long distance to shoot a cage to let a tiger out of it and watch it maul everyone nearby, taking over enemy posts so I can fast travel to them, fixing towers to show the map and unlock new weapons, running people and animals over with my car, upgrading my character with xp to unlock new moves, starting things on fire and watching it spread and last but not least the story missions. You can craft plants but I ended up not crafting any except green ones which give you health because the rest of the plants you can craft are basically useless. Who wants to craft a plant to allow you to be flame retardant for 15 secs? I didn't care anyway.   Unlike plants crafting animals is useful since you can carry more weapons at a time among other things by collecting their skins. I had fun hunting these animals in the wild and checking my list of how many I needed of a certain breed to create whatever it was. However it was pointless hunting animals anymore after you craft everything unless you want to gain barely any money in doing so or just for the hell of it. Looting dead bodies got really annoying because you have to wait and see the same animation over and over again. There is no way to skip it. Another annoying problem was if their weapon is nearby you have to hover over a certain spot on their body to loot them since you use the same key press to pick up their weapon...why couldn't I just hover over their body and get the loot automatically without pressing anything and press a key if I wanted their weapon? I ended up all the time swapping my weapon accidently because of it.   There is really no death animations just ragdoll physics. Which is disappointing since I liked how in Far Cry 2 you can snipe someones leg and they start yelling in pain from it and if one of their friends is nearby they could pick them up and carry them to safety. You shoot anyone in the leg in this game they just die and fall over. The story was a let down to me. It's really a big lame excuse to kill people on an island. You go to the extremes to save your friends in any situation. I didn't like the main characters voice it was annoying and laughable at the sametime. It doesn't help that your character is a real ♥♥♥♥♥ and makes very poor decisions you have to watch unfold that you don't like. The ending wasn't satisfying at all.   Don't get me wrong though I did enjoy alot of the story missions. The co-op is alright but can be frustrating due to waves of overwhelming odds and connection issues. The motion blur in this game gave me headaches and there is no way to turn it off. I am only nitpicking here but you can't blow up a car or truck by sniping it's fuel tank. You can't cut down trees. You can't blow up a building having it's walls collapse in. You can't fly a helicopter. You can't even see your own feet. It's no Crysis that's for sure but I did have fun and I spent alot of time just wrecking havoc.",

            "review_text": " Singleplayer : Campaign: I played the campaign on it's hardest difficulty and it took me somewhere around 15 hours. The story is about Jason Brody having a vacation on an island. And wakes up in a cage realising that his vacation is over and he has to save all his friends so they can get back home. This sounds and also felt generic. But as you continue through the game the story gets more and more interesting, due to well voiced characters and the inspiring monologues. The game also felt like some kind of total recall to me, because the character has many drug trips. So even when I was playing the normal sp missions I was asking myself if it wasn't just a drug trip. Because if the bulk of the story was a drug trip the story would make a lot more sense. The campaign story was mostly the reason that kept me playing.   Gameplay: The gameplay other hand was good and entertaining, but nothing special for me. Some early missions could be annoying, because you were forced to play stealthily. Also the sp missions can sometimes feel as a narrow route. The power of the gameplay itself is that you can choose how you want to play. stealthily or guns blazing. Both can be fun but both also have some issues. The stealth problem is that the ai can be annoying. And for guns blazing you can easily run out of ammo and have to break your arm to revive yourself many times if you play guns blazing.(Atleast on my difficulty. I would maybe recommend to play 1 difficulty below or first do a lot of side missions to unlock more health, weapons etc.) Also if you have no ammo you mostly have to camp until you can easily knife someone, without getting hit. Sadly every endboss fight from the game showed the definition of insanity in gameplay. The game was also a bit overwhelming in the beginning because of the many menus with upgrades. At first I ignored them, but later I really saw the benefit of it. Otherwise you will easily die. The graphics of the game still look nice, I especially liked the lighting. And how much effort there had been put into the building.   Open World: I have to be honest I haven't done that much in it. Because I wasn't really interested in it. Still I can say if you are interested in exploring the world there is alot to do! There are enough side-missions, which is mostly killing enemies/animals in a certain way, missions where you have to go from A to B as fast as you can etc and, of course, collecting stuff. Really the only thing that made me stop fast-traveling from mission to missions was the tower climbing and the animal/flower hunt to unlock stuff. They were more rewarding to me than the side missions that just give you money and xp that I already had enough of.    Online :  Multiplayer: In my opinion the mp isn't that special. It has 4 standard game modes. Of course they are varied with some nice ideas. But to me it just feels like a cod-clone. The multiplayer also has a strong map editor. Probably at the time there were many great mods made. (I found some interesting ones on youtube. ) But now that the game isn't as active anymore, I couldn't find a modded map to play. -Co-op: I played the co-op with someone many months before continuing my singleplayer campaign. It was pretty long at 6-8 hours. But still the co-op was pretty generic and forgetable. The only thing that I liked were the mini-games. What is strange is that the multiplayer and the co-op leveling system are combined. So if I had only played Co-Op, I would have all the unlocked loadouts for the multiplayer.    Overall : I can say Farcry 3 is a great game, but you can ignore the multiplayer and co-op, because they aren't that special and that active anymore. I think for the people who only own FarCry 4, FarCry 3 is still a great game to play, especially for the campaign, that makes it something special.",

This is what a first-shooter, open-world game ought to be. Sure, it lacks character development in some scenes, such as Jason's thrust into the island without seeing his emotions unfold as he loses his brother to Vaas. And the main villain: He was really top-notch. Vaas played his role perfectly, though the game mechanics downplayed his role as a vilain. Taking down bosses in choreographed button mashes and simplistic scenes is no way to end a boss. Same went for Hoyt Voyker and Buck Hughes.  All in all, its' many hours of exploration, take-downs, gliding, sky-diving, killing and blowing up things. A journey you'll be begging to return to over and over again.  Second part: Co-Op. That is some awesome stuff. Adds many, many hours of hilarious gameplay and challenge-based system that add up XP , a'la Trials of the Rakyat in Single Player.  Multi-player: Well, this is probably my favorite so far. You can't play it once. Custom maps can also be built and be featured here too.  Notes: Mature content. Everywhere.

            "review_text": "FarCry 3. One of the BEST games I’ve ever played in my years of gaming. There’s so much to talk about, I guess I’ll divide this game into multiple categories to talk about.  – The storyline 10/10 Words literally how amazingly amazing it felt to play this game. The story mode was well thought out and executed perfectly, an original story with everything else was amazing. I do not wish to spoil the story too much because you NEED to play this game. Basically you are a tourist visiting an island when suddenly something goes wrong…  – The graphics 10/10 Graphic-wise the game is beautiful and detailed, when you’re playing it, it feels like skyrim but with better graphics and more realistic weapons. Sure some computers may not be able to run the game, but the majority of the people who can run the game on the best graphics will admit it you can feel a simple breeze from the wind. The weather system can’t be talked bad about at all because the rain wasn’t too annoying, but was made just perfect.  – The A.I 8/10 The A.I is the only element in the game I could complain about, yet it was marvelous. In times during the game I noticed some A.I glitching in the wall or just auto-noticing me behind a wall. In other times the A.I were just surprisingly professional by avoiding all walls and hiding behind baricades while shooting me only when I stand up to shoot them! Also the A.I of animals was made so they act like they do in real life, from turtles crouching in their shell to sharks slowly getting closer and going in for the kill.  – The Controls 10/10 Everything was designed wisely, starting from the basic-in-every-game controls like WASD and Shift to sprint to smaller details like switching items in your inventory around the way you like.  – The gameplay 10/10 This is the main element of the game which is most essential. The possibilities are infinite, you can play the game as vanilla as you want by using weapons you pick up from the enemy but you can’t taste the game truly unless you’ve tried the RPG’s or the Flamethrower. The leveling up system in the game is not like any other but a very original concept. You unlock new weapons and get them free in shops by claiming land from the enemy or climbing radio towers which noticeably become harder to get on top of with every new one. You can also convert to be a better warrior for the sake of the island by leveling up and getting “Tatau” aka Tattoo’s on your arm which give you abilities like holding your breath underwater longer or decreasing the damage you take from animal bites.  – The Ending 10/10  I really can’t talk much about the ending to not spoil it, but the way you want the game to end is all up to you. There are 2 endings so it’s all up to you how you end the game. – Final Verdict 10/10 The Game as a whole is a 10/10. A First person survival which has more then 30+ Realistic animals. I recommend everyone to play it.",

In the end you get a choice, but honestly it barely is a choice from the perspective of the player, we only kinda know about our main characters background but what we play and thus experience is the complete other side of the coin. So this choice in the end is some stuff we get told apperently happened....vs the stuff we ACTUALLY experienced in the game....so yeah, not much of a choice really.  And what is with the Hype around Vaas?  Dude is seriously barely in teh game, hell everyone is barely there because the core story is so damn short but man, Vaas is in like what, 3 scenes? Whoop di ♥♥♥♥, and nothing about those were remarkable or memorable, hardly the Bane from Dark Knight Rises now is he?  Story falls apart in many places anyway, like the bs reason as to why I cannot instandly kill main baddy, ♥♥♥♥ was also so damn predictable urhhhggggg.  The Island is huge and the game looks good and places are recognisable, soon you will know you way around just like you do after playing a while of GTA, thats all pretty cool. What is not is the actual content, or lack there off. Sure tons of stuff to collect....but that I find hardly constitutes of content. Skyrim for example as a lot of big stuff going on next to the main story, this game could learn from that because it has nothing of the sorts.  All in all I think if I would have to express the experience in a rating, I would be inclined to say maybe a 7/10 but that would be generous.  Its not bad, but its most def not the rating it has on several websites, really need to up our standards yo.",

The only thing holding it back from being a classic, is a very weak story and for the most part laughable acting performances especially the main character, a very tongue-in-cheek plot. Vaas' Character and performance makes up for it somewhat, but not enough to pull the rest of the cast up. Regardless of that, you will enjoy it greatly.",

You can fly, drive, kill, do quests and so on. Unfortunately, the game does go on for a long time.  Also, YOU HAVE TO HAVE UPLAY TO INSTALL THE GAME. KEEP THE CODE YOU NEED IT.

In seventeen hours, I am not even close to done with the singleplayer story and have yet to begin playing co-op or multiplayer, but what I have seen so far is amazing. One outstanding feature is Far Cry 3's use of wildlife, which is superb, and miles ahead of its predecessor, in which you would scarecly see any animals at all. While playing this game, I am in constant fear of tigers, sharks, and crocodiles, namely, but there are other animals which range from frightening (cassowaries, they are the spawn of the devil) to irritating (herds of deer darting past). Another improvement over FC2 is the more widespread utilization of fast travel, which was a huge pain and is now endurable. I am more apprehensive about the change in how outposts are managed. Instead of having enemies respawn every time the player leaves the area, guardposts are now on by default, until permanently turned off when the player kills all the guards stationed there.  tl;dr better than FC2 because of combat system, setting, plot, and ANIMALS",

            "review_text": "Far cry 3 game review. Far cry 3, also known as 'Skyrim with guns.'. There's truth to that, I'll show you in this review.  'Far Cry 3 is an open world action-adventure first-person shooter video game developed mainly by Ubisoft Montreal in conjunction with Ubisoft Massive, Ubisoft Red Storm, Ubisoft Shanghai, and Ubisoft Reflections, published by Ubisoft for Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3. The game was released on November 29, 2012 in Australia, November 30 in Europe, and December 4 in North America. A stand-alone expansion titled Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon was released on April 30, 2013.' (-Wikipedia)  In this review, I'll write about a couple of things: -Story -Gameplay -Enemy AI/Boss fights -Crafting -Minigames -Overal Pros and Cons  -Story. The story start out with you, Jason Brody, partying in a club in Bangkok. You're with your brothers, Riley and Grant, and your other friends. Lisa, Daisy, Keith, and Grand. You're celebrating that your little brother Riley got his pilot's licence. The group decides to go skydive over an island. As you land on the ground, you're captured by local pirates, lead by Vaas. All this is shown to you on a phone camera, held by Vaas as you sit in a cel. You and your brother manage to break out of the cel once Vaas is gone. Halfway through you get caught, and have to run. Once you're safely away from the camp, you meet Dennis. And then your mission to resceu your brother and friends begins.  -Gameplay. As previously stated, far cry 3 is an open world first person shooter. There's plently of weapons to pick from. You start out with a knife and a pistol, and as you enable radio towers and do missions, you unlock more weapons. You can also buy weapons from the store, although the prices are fairly high.  There's also skills to be unlocked. One of the first skills you learn is 'take down' , which allows you to take down an enemy with a knife. As you go along, more skills get unlocked. Once you've unlocked a skills, it will be represented by a tattoo on your left arm. The more skills you get, he more the tattoos form a sleeve.   -Enemy AI/Boss fights. I'll admit the enemy AI isn't the best. They'll run for cover, and sometimes try to get away from you, but they'll hardly do anything to prevent getting shot in the open. For example, if you're at a wide open field, they'll run towards you in a straight line. Sometimes they'll seek cover behind an explodable barrel. Overal, it could be improved, but it's not terrible either. Bos fights are often handled in quick time events, much like animals fights. Quicktime events are made of the following: Left and right mouse button, E, C, and spacebar. Nothing special or hard, but the animation make it look very cool and impressive.  -Crafting. This game also features crafting (Bet you geussed that already!). To improve you have to craft. More storage, more ammo storage, more weapons, more money, and more syringes are some of the things gained by crafting. You can craft multiple sorts of syringes, for healing and combat. There's also syringes for your surrounding, better senses to find animals, holding your breath underwater for longer, and being fireproof.  Syringes are crafted by collecting leaves, the other things are crafted by animals skins.  -Mingames. If you're getting tired from killing pirates and animals, there's also minigames. There are seven of them: Poker (A game of Poker) Racing (Getting from A to B hitting checkpoints) Shooting birds (Shoot birds with a shotgun) Throwing knifes. (Press the button at the right time to throw the knife at the right place on the board) Supply drop. (Get from A to B hitting checkpoints, within the time limit) Wanted Dead. (Kill a pirate with a knife) Hunting qeusts. (Hunt an animal with a specific weapon) All these are unlocked by taking down outposts and activating radiotowers. There's also side mission, all unique.  Overal Pros and Cons. Pros: Fun gameplay Nice graphics, even on low. Large varity of weapons. Good crafting system. Interesting villain (Vaas) Multiplayer (although I've never tried it personally) Lots of Collectables First person driving  Cons: Can get boring if you let it. Second island and villain aren't as interesting as the first. Main character is rather bland and uninteresting Activating radiotowers starts to feel like a chore after a while   Overal I'd rate this game a 9/10. Lots of hours of fun went into this game.",

Story: You are a guy named Jason Brody who he and his friends go on vacation on an island known as The Rook, in which get captured for randsom, and now you need to free them and get off the island alive.  Gameplay: In an open-world island filled with exotic creatures and menacing enemies, players are given the ability to survey and plot their attacks when it comes to danger; with either stealths, such as silent takedowns by performing melee attacks from above, below, or close behind, or just sheer brutality like taking an RPG and shooting explosive objects. Equipment is controlled by a simple system: Missions get completed, new items are unlocked to be purchased or crafted. Skills are are unlocked in three skill trees, collected by gaining experience from simply killing enemies or doing missions.  Pros: +Organic gameplay. +Layered narrative. +Great story. +Can be modded the crap out of. +Has multiplayer. +Has co-op campaign. +Awesome guns. +Amazing characterization. +Amazing graphics. +Moving soundtrack. Doesn't beat Skyrim's, but it's awesome. +Fantastic single-player campaign. +Upgrade system and character progression is astounding, featuring experience points, skill trees, and a crafting system. +Ecology and unpredictable creatures make the world vivid.  Cons: -Can get slighty repetitive. -Quick-time events. -Too many in-game cutscenes, leaving little to no control over your character. -Some boss fights sucked. -Unrealistic upgrade system. I mean, come on, tattoos make you stronger? -Side characters, meaning Jason Brody's drug-loving, alcohol-drinking friends, are ♥♥♥♥ing arrogant. -Like most other free-roam RPGs, this gets boring upon completion of the game. -Co-op mission design feels lackluster. -You need the right rig to play this game. -Ubisoft's Uplay.",

Now what you hear is what youd expect out of a powder keg of insanity, great sound effects, the explosions and guns all make satisfying bangs and booms but are only out done by the voice acting which is top notch and holly ♥♥♥♥ Michael Mando, the voice of Vaas, might be my favorite performance out of a video game. His performance sets new standards for voice acting in video games that will be hard to out do as he emodies his psychotic character with such character and anger and youd think there'd be nothing to out do the voice acting? YOUD BE WRONG. The soundtrack for this game is phenomenal and while not my favorite sound track in a game is pretty high up there as of now. Its not your typical score it not only accompanies the various moments of the game but adds to them sometimes elevating them and causing cold chills (I felt them) it has this indie sound that is very pleasing and I hope its composer Brian Tyler continues to bring such character to his next works..

You can just run/drive/fly around and do nothing or you can; hunt animals, craft items, free settlements, find relics and other secrets, take over radio towers, do some trials and a whole lot of other activities and (side)quests. It's seemingly endless and completing the entire game will take you probably well over 50 hours. Now that's some value right there.  The graphics are just gorgeous, no matter what settings you use. You can't make this game look bad, you just can't. The animations and models are some of the best I've seen in a game. Wow. The same thing applies to the sounds and voice acting, which is brilliant and truly convincing.  While doing the story and sidequests you'll earn XP to upgrade your skills. There are 3 skilltrees in total and the way you play the game is entirely up to you. The Shark skilltree will let you upgrade your assault and healing skills, while the Heron tree will help you with your sniper skills and speed and finally, the Spider tree will let you focus on your stealth and survival skills. There's no right way to play this. There are many ways to complete an objective. And that's what makes Far Cry 3 fun, but not necessarily unique.  However, there aren't many FPS that give you this much freedom, while telling a realistic, focused, story at the same time. So I take my hat off to Ubisoft for creating this masterpiece. The commercial and critical success for this game is well deserved.  Let this be a lesson - and example - for future first person shooters. Hooray for Far Cry 3 !  [Rating: 92/100]",

            "review_text": "TL;DR- Far Cry 3 manages to improve on its predecessor without abandoning most of its basic mechanics. Does have a ridiculous plot that is terribly handled at the end.   I had a love/hate relationship with Far Cry 2. I loved the weapons, the world, and the combat. But I hated the way the place was populated only by people who wanted to kill you on sight (except for in the closed cities). I didn't like the way enemies respawned automatically and the beautiful world was somewhat marred when I couldn't enjoy a senic boat ride without getting sniper fire, even though I'd crushed that outpost five minutes earlier. Unlocking weapons tended to be a bit tedious as well, though it was worth it to get some of the best ones. The mortar in FC2 is one of my favorite weapons in ANY game. It took patience to figure out, but once mastered it could be used to desolate an enemy encampment in dramatic fashion.  FC3 keeps the nice variety of weapons, with the facepalming exception of the above-mentioned mortar. I guess it was unbalancing because of how useful it could be against outposts, but I still wish they had left it in somewhere. Vehicles are still fun, as are boats, plus handgliding is actually a bit more doable in this game- even useful when the game doesn't cheat and turn on the invisible walls for missions. Best of all, not everyone is out to kill you at all times. There are different factions in the game and only MOST want to kill you at any one time! You can actually see battles between the different factions where you can help one over the other. When you take out an enemy outpost, it stays down... unless you decide to revert them back to enemy control so you can have fun blowing them up again- a neat option by the devs to placate both sides of the 'respawning enemies' argument. Plus they've added carnivors. If you remember in FC2 they made some kind of hand-waving statement that they couldn't do that because it would wreck the simulation... or something. Well this time they said 'screw it, add more tigers!' Bravo.   There are a lot of gimmicks in the game. You can blow open the cages of conveniently placed animals to screw with enemies, use hand-gliders or zip lines that just happen to be near enemy outposts, or... all sorts of other stuff that sometimes gets a little old. But there's enough variety that the fun makes up for the head-scratching about why the redshirts don't learn not to leave a man-eating tiger around the middle of their base. There are plenty of unscripted surprises (the first time a croc tries to eat you, for example... happens to everyone) and the whole thing is just a fun romp. The plot... well, I don't really care much about the plot. They botched it a bit by having the sub-enemy be more interesting than anyone else in the game, and there's a lot of trippy psycadelic fight scenes. The free-form part of the game is the draw. There are some RPG elements that really don't need to be there and don't serve much purpose, other than to seemingly check off a box on the list of things every game is supposed to have... but it's not a big deal.  Also a shame is the lack of a day-night cycle as in FC2. It worked so nicely and could have been used to great effect here with easier stealth at night and movement by day, or some other trade-off mechanic. Much of the plot is also nonsensical and a QTE torture scene is so hamfisted I had to roll my eyes when the protagonist looks at his hands afterwards. The whole plotlineis a contrived piece of garbage that could have been solved by your character or his combat-knife equipped buddy just killing the Big Bad who is sitting three feet away and jumping out a window... the same kind of thing you can do at every other part of the game that isn't a cutscene. But instead you have to wait until another QTE-ridden dream sequence... or something... to finish him off. Then have an awful on-rails sequence that, again, makes no sense and seems to be there just to annoy the player. Oh, and combine that with an escort mission. And the escorted person is a moron who seems to purposely get you shot down.   The plot is a necessary evil. The way its handled is... well, an unnecesary evil. Frankly the entire last mission arc is crap. But FC3's island is worth the price of admission... maybe be smarter than I was and just ignore everything after the second island gets unlocked, plot-wise.",

            "review_text": "FarCry 3 is a great game. The scale of the map, as well as the great combat features and the graphics is in perfect balance.   Let's start with combat. FC3 has a fantastic takedown system. Some takedowns are automatic, like jumping off a ledge and killing an enemy below. Some need more skill, like doing chained takedowns. Of course, you need to unlock these takedowns.  Shooting is fluid and fun, and the satisfaction of ridding an outpost of pirates is a constant fuel to play this game.   Hunting, on the other hand, is fun at first, but there are times when you go to the designated hunting spot only to find nothing is there. This has happened to me numerous times, and even using a Hunting Syringe didn't do squat. Hunting is fun at times, but does become a chore.  As for the story, it is rather generic. A bunch of kids get captured by pirates and one of these kids, a sore loser who was going no where with his life, manages to pick up a gun for the first time in his life, and liberate the islands from the pirates, while the Rakyat (People of the Island) stood around doing nothing.  The vehicles are great fun. The driving mechanics are fantastic! Driving cars through the lush forest, or driving jetskis around hunting for sharks is fun and responsive. The gliders however, are a bit useless and are always difficult to disembark as you always lose health from doing so. \\  However, I will say this now. The game lacks guns. There are not enough guns!!! The only guns you get are four or five assault rifles, four sniper rifles and so on. By the end of the game, signature weapons were the only thing I was using (along with a silenced sniper rifle) Also, the main menu feels very clunky and weird. And I wish they had not implemented the loot rucksack in the main menu. It drives me mad, especially when you want to drop unwanted loot, but have to keep clicking it, deleting and clicking yes to delete it.  Graphically, the game is beautiful. Everything from the lush vegetation to the water is really well made and detailed. Explosions look realistic and everything in this game is amazing.  Also, I felt as if they did not use some entities as much as they should. For starters, Vaas only appears a couple of times. At the start, and somewhere halfway into the game. To me, Vaas was a great and interesting character, and they should of used him more. Same thing goes with Hoyt. After reaching the South Island, I was expecting to have a long war dance with Hoyt, only to find that his time as the main enemy is short.   But multiplayer is where this game becomes bad. FC3 multiplayer is AWFUL! It's worse than Blacklight: Retribution, it's worse than COD: Ghosts. It's just a generic, non interesting pirates vs rakyat. Coop is a massive letdown. Instead of having the ability to free roam around Rook Island with your mate, you're pitted in a semi cliche set of linear missions that involve killing tons of pirates. It's ok, and can be quite fun at times, but the worst thing is the BLOODY BOMB CARRYING MISSIONS. Throughout the campaign, there are parts which involve you picking up bombs or rockets and carrying them to certain locations. When you pick one up, you can't sprint, you can't crouch, you can't do ♥♥♥♥ but carry this bomb to its location. It is boring, and a chore especially when your teammate doesn't do ♥♥♥♥ but get downed forcing you to drop the bomb and revive them. It is instantly noticable that Ubisoft just went lazy with the Co-op. After almost an hour of playing through one of the missions, my friend discovered a unique spot where, if you keep running against it, you glitch and fall out of the world, killing yourself in the process. you can also glitch yourself inside Seto's truck by running to its spawn point just as it spawns. The Co-op maps are just poorly made, and are incredibly tedious and repetitive. They also removed the fire spreading system. In Co-op, flamethrowers held by Flamers are OP as hell. But once you have the flamethrower, it does absolutely squat. What was wrong with a free roaming coop mode? Driving around together liberating outposts and ridding the island of pirates.  That sounds far better than the crappy boring coop mode they gave us.  I usually get bored of games very quickly, but I found myself playing this game for hours on end. If you don't want to do the sometimes boring missions, you can always go around liberating outposts, exploring Rook Island and looking for Letters, Relics and so on.  Great game, fun gameplay, great combat system. Don't get this game for its multiplayer.  This is the kind of game where you turn down the in-game music, put on your favourite power songs and play. This is what I did for my second and third playthroughs, and it was amazing! Some of the songs I listened to are forever associated with my killing of pirates! Great experience, one that I won't likely ever forget.  9/10",

I don't care how dumb the story is (it's not, but that was apparently a fluke), it's internally consistent enough to be coherent and convincing while being vague and last minute enough in other places to be totally compelling and mysterious, like Lost was before Damon Lindelof realised viewers were way smarter than he'd ever given them credit for and his insistence that this wasn't a case painted him into a cringe-inducing corner.  I digress.  Far Cry 3 is really, really good and interesting and fun. The island is beautiful, the wildlife is interesting, the fire system is more or less intact from the otherwise terrible Far Cry 2 SO THAT'S GOOD and the music is some of my favourite in a long, long time. There's an overwhelming amount of things to see and do, thanks to the scattershot 'world map full of activity markers' Ubisoft school of design, and almost all of it is really fun and usually quite a diversion from the 'routine' gameplay.  But nothing in Far Cry 3 is routine. Everything kind of feels special and exciting. If you liked Far Cry or The Beach or Lost or Arrow then you should definitely give Far Cry 3 a try. You probably should anyway.",

And not just because if you get bored you can hurl yourself off a cliff. No, the devs of this game really went the extra mile. For example, the hunting. Yes, you can slowly sneak up on deer before blasting it with a shotgun (if you're boring), or you can grab a flamethrower and molotov cocktails, light a section of forest on fire, and when a bear or pig runs past you trying to escape, you can stab it multiple times in the back. Also, there's a lot of side quests. From finding a missing suicidal teen to seeing how many komodo dragons you can kill with one clip of pistol ammo, there's always something to keep you busy. Also, certain non-essential tasks can help you in the long run. Sure, it may seem boring to climb various towers to reactivate old cell phone beacons, but it'll all pay off when the air fills with smoke and you can still see every one of the dudes you are about to terminate. Which brings me, yes, to the combat. The combat in this game is fantastic, and filled with variety. You can rip a dude's neck out and leave him out to be discovered by already terrified pirates; you can lure over a pack of wild dogs and let Mother Nature do the work. Hell, you can just run up to a guy and beat him over and over with a blowtorch, until he either dies of trauma or lights on fire. A personal favourite of mine was to kill a helicopter pilot while he hovered over an enemy outpost, causing the vehicle to spiral out of control, crushing both the pirates and presumably two or three tigers. Overall, this game gets a solid plus. It's Rambo, Terminator and Tomb Raider squished into one, and I love it. God help me, I love it.",

Its setting is a strong point- showing off just how well the developers worked to create a living-breathing environment that you can become completely immersed in. Graphically, it is very aesthetically pleasing but can be very taxing on older machines. Gameplay-wise it mostly fluid and intuitive, with a good, solid movement system and shooting mechanics designed for fast paced but skillful shooting. However it came become a pain to quickly move in and out of vehicles and healing yourself can become a serious pain. Few games can claim to have a story I've given 2 half-baked waffles about but Far Cry 3 has quite a good story. With engaging charater arcs and plot twists that twist the plot for once. The story is all very tight and works well with the rest of the game. However, while I don't want to spoil the ending too much, it's one of the only parts where the game lets itself down. The final mission of the game is split two ways - Flying from the enemy base in a helicopter to 'Ride of the valkyries' in an epic mounted turret section- then going through some boring tibal love drama nonsence. Then you pick if you want to be with your friends and escape or with Citra- the tribe leader. Its a sort of moral choice sequence with no moral choice. The 'friend end' is the only real end as the other one just ruins most of the stories believeability.",

Three of Far Cry 3's biggest and best features are the range of weapons, the choices you can make while completing normal tasks and the characters. On rook Island there are a massive range of weapons, including Rifles, Snipers, Bows, Rocket Launchers, Grenade Launchers, Flame Throwers and many, many more. These weapons each have the normal upgrades like bigger magazine, silencer and many more. These attachments let you be creative in killing; when overtaking outposts you can be sneaky with a bow and a silenced AK-47 taking out enemies with these weapons and skills, including creative takedowns, or you can go in guns-blazing with a grenade launcher, Machine Gun and explosive arrows. And Finally, despite the main characters weak and funny (in a bad way) personality, the other characters are really entreging. Sadly these characters seem to disapeer, or get taken out of the spotlight as soon as you meet them and start to like them. Thank Fully that is the only downside, your stuck with annoying characters and sadly your favourite characters are even killed or not seen a lot after an hour or two.

The game was released on November 29, 2012 in Australia, November 30 in Europe, and December 4 in North America. A stand-alone expansion titled Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon was released on April 30, 2013.  Far Cry 3 is set on a tropical island between the Indian and Pacific Oceans. After a vacation goes awry, protagonist Jason Brody must save his friends, who have been kidnapped by pirates and escape from the island and its unhinged inhabitants.  The third installment in the Far Cry series, Far Cry 3 was critically acclaimed upon release, with reviewers praising its world design, open-ended gameplay and story, while the game's multiplayer mode was criticized. Following the game's success, Ubisoft announced a successor, Far Cry 4.",

            "review_text": "Far Cry 3 has by far reigned among my top 5 open world games, every aspect of this game is great; from the story; to the gameplay; the action, world and its mechanics. You are Jason Brody, a young man looking for an adventure while vacationing on a remote island with your closest friends. Yet you get more than what you bargained for, when your group is kidnapped by drug pedaling pirates to be sold to the underground world of slavery. Now its up to you to save your friends, bring peace back to this once pristine environment, and inspire hope to its native people. As you diverge from your expected path you become a true product of your new environment. You turn from a scared boy, to a ruthless warrior. Though be careful who you trust, for betrayal is lurking around every corner.  This game is like no other, the story missions are long and tough and the side missions are a blast. You must climb to the top of hundred foot radio towers to acquire maps, radar and weapons; liberate pirate outposts; learn the lay of the land; hunt its native creatures, both docile and ferocious; find its most precious and scarce relics; bounty hunt for the islands most wanted; and test your skills through vigorous timed trials. This enormous world has more than enough ways to spend your time. If you feel like taking a break from the fighting, go play some poker, place wagers on your marksmanship, throw knives, get laid, or race ATVs.  As you delve in to this chaotic world, you find all resources at the palm of your hand. Customize your weapons by adding scopes, extended magazines and suppressors. You can pick someone off from a mile away, shoot them in the back with your bow and arrow, slit someone's throat, or blow it all up! Every desirable weapon is available at your disposal; hand guns, shotguns, assault rifles, SMGs, LMGs, RPGs, C4 explosives, knives, even a f**king flamethrower; everything your twisted heart could desire! The question is, how will you save this world? As a silent assassin, or a gun toting juggernaut?  Choose who you wish to become by picking skills from three separate skill trees. You can chose to become a stealthy assassin, a long range killer, an unstoppable killing machine or all three. Will you learn how to shoot from a zip line, or how to silently ambush numerous enemies from atop and below? These skill will also help you become a better hunter-gatherer. Collect indigenous plants to craft potent remedies and abilities or learn to silently hunt a tiger or shark for its hide.  Like any good contemporary game, there is multiplayer along with coop. Fight with or against players across the world to complete objectives, sabotage each other's bases, go on missions, or just shoot each other up in death match. Be careful though, for the losing teams best player is to be made an example of. The winning team can chose to show mercy, or beat him to within an inch of his life.   So mount up! This world cannot be saved without your efforts. Just remember, trust no one. Not even yourself...",

            "review_text": "An almost perfect Open World FPS with crafting and RPG elements. The story is amazing and the acting/voiceover work is probably the best I've ever seen in a game (the guy who plays Vaas is incredible. Best villain EVER). The thing that impressed me most about this game is, you don't have to spend hours of your time crafting an sorting through piles of junk, trying to determine what to keep and what to sell or discard. Junk is easily 'quick sold' and is explicitly marked as junk so there's no need to feel like you should hold onto it until later in the game when it may come in handy. The only real items of importance when it comes to crafting are animal skins for capacity upgrades (i.e., how much stuff you can carry) and plants for crafting medicines and buffs.  Leveling and stat trees are balanced and easily managed. It's possible to gain every skill in the game in a single run through so you don't have to feel like you missed out or ruined your game by taking one skill point over another. Just simply farm up some more XP and get that skill as well.  Finally, the graphics are beautiful, even if a bit aged. It's very easy to get totally submersed in the game with the wonderful graphics and beautiful locations, especially considering how great the story is and how amazing the voice and acting talent are (did I mention that Vaas is incredible? Because if there were ever Oscars given to video game actors, he should be the first to receive one). The options menu is deep and extremely configurable, from key layouts to graphics and sound settings. I have a pretty basic bargain-bin laptop (Acer Aspire E 15) with no modifications running the integrated intel HD 4400 with 1792 VM and can get the game to run with a bit of lag at full settings. I run mostly on medium with a few settings set to high, however, and get a constant frame rate of ~30fps (which is great for my non-gaming computer).  My only gripe with this game is the soundtrack. It's pretty bland and bear-bones and neither adds nor subtracts from the game. It's just kind of 'there'. It doesn't hinder the experience in any way but I feel with a stronger score or maybe even the addition of some licensed music added during key scenes, it could have added that much more to the submersive experience.  Overall, this game is a 9.5 out of 10 which by my grading standards, is practically a 10. I save 10s for the absolute best of the best. Games that not only are damn near perfectly designed and executed and fun to play, but which have also changed the landscape of gaming in general and paved the way for others to follow. The only '10's I've played I can count on 2 hands (Super Mario 3 and Super Mario World, The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past and Ocarina of Time, Half-Life II, Tetris, Mrs. Pac-Man and maybe a few more I'm forgetting). Far Cry 3 is almost there but, there isn't much here that hasn't already been done before. That said, everything about the game that came from other games, Far Cry 3 put it all together and made it better as a whole than anyone else in it's genre. They took the best parts of games like Borderlands and Fallout and improved upon them in a way that's damn near perfect.",

            "review_text": "This game is an exact cross between Far Cry and Far Cry 2. For those that don’t remember, Far Cry was the first game (afaik) which allowed players to hide in shrubs on a massive tropical island with luscious green foliage. It used the first Crytek game engine. In Far Cry 2, you couldn’t really hide in shrubs, instead you were placed on a barren African landscape wearing a straw hat and on safari. This time the Dunia game engine was used which I’d personally say is more than just a heavily modified version of the CryEngine.  Far Cry 3 uses the Dunia Engine 2. What this means is, the gameplay mechanics and overall feel of the game will be more like Far Cry 2. This is particularly noticeable with the shooting mechanics, the openness of the landscapes with trails/tracks/villages/compounds and even the driving of boats and vehicles will feel pretty much the same. Except the only difference is you’re on a luscious island where you have plenty of shrubs to hide in (or burn lol).  What’s different? We get a pretty full on cinematic experience. It almost felt personal with the characters being so close and their faces taking up the entire screen. I thought they all wanted to kiss me. Aside from that, I thought all characters were standup comedians. Vaas in particular, but Buck as well. They have hilariously crazily loveably outrageous personalities.  There is also an XP skill system in place. It didn’t bother me (see my Hitman: Absolution review) but after a year I’m now growing to hate seeing this in games. Not only is it a lame way to track progress, I reckon it damages the RPG genre. But like I said, it wasn’t much of a bother in this game.  Overall Far Cry 3 in my opinion is for those that seek a very slow-paced game where you complete menial tasks on the island, but with the goal of exploration. Having said that, the island is a work of art, very detailed at every place. Not just a piece of terrain where they plopped buildings and 3D models on randomly.  It’s interesting seeing how the land mixes in with the river banks, tree roots, erosion and sediments. Like you’ll see some tin shack on some beach in the middle of nowhere with intricately placed shore rocks, or you may walk through a plain field of grass with some oak-like trees during the night, or a lake in the middle of nowhere, it’s an experience to remember.  I can almost certainly guarantee you that you won’t traverse the same spots on the island more than twice. This can be proven by purchasing maps to display the locations of all the loot chests. There’s a crap load of them! And for about 30 hours I was really nitpicky in the beginning opening those chests.  The game was a bit buggy for me from time to time, but I always seemed to pull out of it without losing too much progress. Like sometimes you can bypass waypoints with ease which will break the mission. I also didn’t like long unnecessary animations like patting corpses for loot. Sometimes the game would just crash when I sell a lot of loot items in the store. I run an AMD 5000+ overclocked to 3GHz and HD6870. This is a pretty old gaming rig and I was able to play on high settings comfortably enough (felt like 25-30 fps when running).  I prefer Far Cry 2, but Far Cry 3 is a very sophisticated game technology-wise. Definitely a step forward that newcomers can jump into without needing to play the predecessors since the stories and characters are all different.  *note this review was cut down from 9000+ words.",

Unfortunately, very minimal emphasis on developing the friends you are actually saving. I would have enjoyed to have seen more on that aspect.   The multiplayer is also broken and would have been fun to play. The fact that this is also a Uplay game also meant that there was another challenge in actually getting the game working. Although it was worth it, it was still not a pleasing experience to have, so keep that and mind when purchasing this title. Not all the issues with Uplay can be fixed, and you may not be able to play this game.   The game took be roughly 17 hours on normal. Once you complete the game though, there is very little reason to return to it, especially with multiplayer down. I may go back and restart the campaign on a more challenging diffuculty, but once you complete the campaign there is no rewarding reason to continue exploring.   Overall, the fact that the story was really interesting, and at some stages quite poignant. At least for myself, outweighs the negatives that I mentioned above.

I don't like that it uses uplay because I bought the game through Steam and would like to play it only through Steam. But as long as it's fast going through their servers and isn't a complete nuisance to sign on, whatever.  However, the first time I tried to play this it took me a ♥♥♥♥ing HALF HOUR to get in the damn game. At first it said uplay's servers were busy or offline, which took a while. I thought 'Ok, fine, I'll play offline. No big deal.' Guess what?! You CAN'T play offline the first time you run the game. So I HAD to go through their servers. When they were finally accessible, I got the Uplay captcha puzzle, which involved putting a single set of numbers from a single picture into two boxes. The rules: One box cannot be blank. The number cannot be copied into both boxes. The numbers cannot be split up. Think the audio captcha will help you out? It specifically says not to put spaces in, then says one set of numbers. Refreshing the captcha didn't help, I kept getting the same damn problem until I found one that had a letter tacked onto the end of the numbers which I put into the other box, and it finally worked. At this point I was pretty mad, I just wanted to play my ♥♥♥♥ing game and instead I'm wasting time trying to figure out the impossible captcha.  From this point on it was easy to log in, the only other problem I had was that at one point my game stopped syncing, so when my SSD got scrambled (uplay decided to install itself on my windows drive instead of my programs drive), I lost half my progress. I also didn't know it at the time, but I wasn't getting achievements for storyline events. When I played through them again, I got them. So back up your saves, guys!  FINALLY, THE GAME  The game feels very much like the new Tomb Raider except more open. I also got a few fleeting feelings of Assassin's Creed. Like how it feels to play those games? You'll probably like this one. There's a wide variety of weapons and I like that you can get a lot for free by unlocking towers. Going hunting is actually good for something, as you use it to craft holsters, rucksacks, etc.  The story didn't impress me at first, nor the character development, but I'm liking it much more now. I only wish there were more conversation opportunities with your friends! They all seem very one-dimentional, with the exception of Daisy, who just seems much more nuanced in her words and expressions. I will update this as I finish the game, 3 missions to go.  The graphics are great, albeit a bit repetative (but they are on an island, so... lots of palm trees are to be expected, I guess). A few problems where I see black/blue shapes but nothing terrible or constant. Sometimes characters vibrate, which makes it ridiculously hard to snipe.  Controls are great for the most part, the problem I have is when performing special actions. When I'm climbing a radio tower, stepping onto the very edge, and see ropes where 'climb' should appear...it doesn't. I can wiggle one way or the other and sometimes it shows up, sometimes not. So I can jump and sometimes have the game catch me and climb up, or I can fall to my death and start over. Annoying. More annoying is when I'm sneaking around an enemy camp like a boss, killing people, when I sneak up behind someone and the 'takedown' option doesn't appear. Again, I move around, sometimes it works. Most of the time though they either turn around and alert the whole camp, or I slice but don't kill them and they alert the whole camp.  Open world, lots of places to explore even if climbing towers and liberating camps gets boring. Can't wait to see how it ends.",

The roads are just as dangerous as the jungle early on. Pirates patroll the roads with .30 and .50 caliber machine guns mounted on top of Jeeps or just 2-4 guys with AK-47's in the back of a truck. Once Jason completes a few missions, crafts a few bags and holsters and unlocks a few parts of the tattoo the game really takes off. Jason goes from a scared early 20 something kid to a merciless pirate killing machine quickly. Whatever you do, don't shoot innocent people, you get punished for it in game. The Islands are huge and the South Island is much more challenging than the North Island. On the South Island, you trade Pirates for a trained and well armed private army.

If you must submit yourself to this game, do so for the vast openworld environment (which you can explore with jetskis, ATVs, hang gliders, etc) and its decent mix of stealthy and actiony shoot bangs.

The negative aspects are tha there is no way to actually view your character (who seems to possess no feet!) and thus the equipment upgrades have no visual impact. The weapon choices are a bit limited for each of the two phases of the game when you get to unlock new weapons, although those available are fully and realistically customizable. The non realistic component is the healing system, which showcases 1st aid and self crafted syringes capable of (in later level and the corresponding skills) almost fully heal you amidst a hail of bulets in a matter of like 2 seconds. Aside from that the game boasts excellent graphics, very good characters and voice acting, a good variety of side quests and achievements (the achievements are shown on Uplay, and extra program you install together with FC3) as well as a variety of rewards and extra content that can be unlocked for free by spending points you get while playing the game. Aside from questing, you are fully able to explore around the two available islands, make little safaris and pursue some extra adrenaline with activities like paragliding, base jumping etc (I even flew on a paraglider from one island to another just for the sake of it xD) !",

You are Jason Brody, this fellow that by a series of events happen to be in the wrong place in the right time. Or the right place in the wrong time. You and your friends and brothers are going parachuting or skydiving, and happen to fall on this beaaaaauuuutiful island, full of wild animals, pirates, drug dealers and Vaas. Yes Vaas. This guy is the ultimate crazy, nuthead, badass. Unless you are a fan of insanity, then you two will have a lot to talk about. I think he was underused in the game actually. Anyway, as you get on the island you and your friends are captured/enslaved and you will become the next Rambo to help your friends to escape this devilish island of all its perils. Yeah that's the only thing that annoyed me. You are a stupid kid and become Rambo. I disgress. Anyway you are rambo and you meet this gorgeous lady, called Citra, leader of this tribe that is losing the battle to the pirate/drug dealers and you decide to help her nice little ♥♥♥ and her indian fellows to rid the island of Vaas and his pupils. I just need to stress this: go on and play it, you won't regret this decision.",

As well as all kinds of cars, trucks and quad bikes.  A lot of activities in this game from doing quests, racing, hunting, capturing outposts, crafting to gathering herbs, collectibles, helping people on the road and simply exploring the two islands you're around. Main character has a bit annoying voice acting that will grow on you as time passes, characters in game are well voiced with their own story, appearance and mental state.  Game has stealth mechanics, in form of silent kills, silent weapons, etc. There's a lot of weapons available in game, some melee and mostly ranged ones, with heavy customization and upgrade option.

The hunting is satisfying because it serves a purpose by allowing the player to hold more money, more ammo, more C4, more carrying capacity, and more syringes; because drugs are your friend in this game. Finding loot and collectibles are good adding more hours of gameplay and playing poker fun as well giving players choices in difficulty that changes the price to buy in. The only gripes I have with this game are with some skills not being very useful, money being limited, limited encounters with certain animals, not being able to experience co-op because not a lot of people use Uplay, and Uplay.

I has a rich storyline, with a lots of characters, heart booming events, and an awesome atmosphere.  Singleplayer, as I said, is the best part on this game. There are alots of exciting missions, side missions, quests, and colletcting items aswell, such as collecting hide of animals to craft holsters, plants to craft medicine, or just find collectable stuff, like Relics, Letters and other stuff. There are also a lots of minigames, like poker, racing, ski jet racing, shooting... If you dont like storylines, and rather explore, or do random stuff, you can still enjoy this game.  Multiplayer isnt really the best. Its still a lot of fun though, although if Ubisoft took care about it a bit more, it would have been a lot better. Its fun to do the missions, but the story of the multiplayer campaign is a bit short. Its still fun to play it, especially at harder difficulty, where its also a bit challenging.  Overall, I rate this game 8 / 10. Its awesome at singleplayer, but a bit boring on multiplayer",

And it totally delivered on that front - it's a true blend of action/shooter/rpg. There are still things about the game that are slightly impractical or make it too easy, but can't say they have detracted from the game in any way.  I'm about halfway through FC3 and have already put in about 50 hrs... that speaks for how much the game has to offer in terms of exploration and side missions/tasks. From hunting animals for their skins to claiming radio towers and outposts, there's plenty to do when roaming the vast land. Admittedly, it can get a little repetitive, but the game in general is too much fun to let that be a setback.  The story is involving, the graphics are beautiful and the gameplay is smooth and extremely easy to pick up (shooter newb here). You have the option to go in all Rambo or take the Hitman path in approaching most tasks, which is awesome because who doesn't like a bit of everything? The change in pace you can take is a real blessing.   Really impressed with the game so far. I might just pick up more shooters thanks to the great example FC3 has set.  9/10",

You can buy or earn various weapons and customise these to your own appeal which is a great feature and ultimately helps you to enhance and personalise the guy you play as, Jason.   Although you may find some missions or feature difficult, or even too complicated, there is an immersive help feature with all the intel you need, as well as a large and friendly community. The Combat is fluent and changes as you level up and learn new skills, and your choice of perks can really save you or doom you.   This game is great but I have only one problem with it, the price of £15 which is why I bought it on a sale. Overall though, if you have money to spare or just don't care, if you want another fun open world FPS with a few twists and turns, and a brilliant story and competitive trials, this is definetely a game to play.

        {
            "review_text": "I just finished this game and I liked it a lot, but there were problems. Some were just annoying, like how when I climb a ledge, I am grabbing the air 6 inches away from the ledge or how if I got a phone call before getting a main mission, I'd have to hear it every time I loaded the game or completed a side mission.  The best part was combat. The enemies in the first half of the game are easy to hide from until you start shooting. In the second half, they will see you better, but you are wearing their uniform so they won't be hostile until you are, or if you go into a restricted area. My only problem with combat was that if I miss with the bow, the enemies know where I was shooting from, but if you hit, they didn't seem to know. What made it great though is how the enemies rally and more will come once you start making noise. What seems like an easy fight against two enemies can quickly become a fight against 6, coming from different directions.  This game fixes a problem I had with FarCry 2. In FC2, I was annoyed that to get anywhere easily, I had to drive through several outposts which were constantly manned by enemies that respawned rather quickly. There were not multiple sensible ways to get somewhere. Here, there are enemies around and you have to be careful, but there are choices, such as driving on or off road, or walking over hilly terrain. You also don't keep fighting enemies in the same spot every time. However, there is one big problem. There are these enemy controlled outposts throughout the island. They are avoidable, so they don't have the problem FarCry 2 had. However, while clearing them is fun, especially trying to go undetected, clearing the outpost makes the area 'safe' meaning the tribe you are helping takes over. Now you will have allies in the area instead of enemies. The problem is that this makes those areas boring as there is no longer a threat. It also breaks my immersion. Where were all these fighters before? If the pirates have complete control of the island, why do they never take these outposts back?  There is actually some story justification for why you go quickly from inexperienced and afraid to a killing machine. It may or may not be enough for you, but it's something.  This was the first open world game I was able to stick with my attempt to not use fast travel. The world is big, but unless you are going from one end to the other, you don't feel like it takes forever. The island is beautiful and they really did great work and put in many detailed areas. The relics are meaningless collectibles, but they are worth collecting to see the locations where they are hidden. The Letters of the Lost, letters written by Japanese soldiers from WWII, were interesting and worth finding.  Finally, most of the side missions were fun. The supply runs were a blast because they make you drive over crazy terrain, not just a road. The Wanted Dead missions were also cool and requiring a knife kill made several difficult. However, some of the hunting missions are stupid, such as when you are asked to 'hunt' rapid dogs with an RPG or flamethrower. That's the Path of the Warrior?  The main antagonist, Vaas was one of the best I've seen. They do a great job of exploring if your character is actually becoming like his enemy. However, they deal with him in a really stupid way. Basically, he beats you in cutscenes several times throughout the game. After one of these times, you go into what seems like a dream state where you fight him. You have no reason to think anything about it is real, but you wake up and are told Vaas is dead. That's it. Lame.   Edit: The story justification is actually really good, but it is horribly unsatisfying from a gameplay perspective.  The last problem is that the ending gives you a choice despite there being no choices to make during the course of the game. One seems to fit, but the other makes no sense and you have absolutely no reason to choose it. It's as if they tried to give you a Star Wars dark side option, or a choice like the original Fable. However because there were no morality choices throughout the game, it didn't fit. Also, something happens that made me want revenge. I have never wanted to storm an enemy camp and kick ♥♥♥ more than I did at he end of this game, but it didn't let me.  Overall, I do recommend it. It was fun, but there are problems that keep it from being great. 7/10",

            "review_text": "Overall I enjoyed playing Far Cry 3. The story was amazing and the developers did a good job on portraying the aspect of building relationships with the people you meet along the way. When I say this game has a good story I mean the gameplay flows nicely and the concept of the story is really intresting. But to be completly honest with you this game is a really sad game if you think about it. First off everyone on the island except for the civilians living there has a problem. What was once a peaceful island turned into an absolute power struggle between three waring factions. Not only that but if you think of it many of these factions were into bad habits such as killing innocent people for money and doing drugs and the worst part is they learned to enjoy it. What's even sadder about this game is 'you' as a character also fell responsible for killing people and thourghout the game your chracter starts getting used to it like it's an everday thing. Although, you were trying to save your friends at the end of the game your character comes to realize that he has turned into something that he does not want to be and what he has done on the island will always be in his memory. This is why I find the game sad. One thing I didn't like about the game was the Multiplayer I had many issues with connecting to servers and even if I did get into a server tons of host migration were soon to follow which disrupted the gameplay to a point were the game was unplayable and in my opinion the Far Cry series is more of a single player game rather than a multiplayer game. Eventhough, this was the first Far Cry game I played I can't wait for the next Far Cry to come out and I can't wait to see what it has to offer.  Below I have posted an overall layout about the pros and cons of this game.   PROS: -Great Story Mode. -Amazing Graphics. -Open World. -Vehicles. -Great gameplay experience no lag in singleplayer. -The game is still fun and offers you challaning things to do after you have completed the story.  CONS: -Terrible Multiplayer.",

            "review_text": "The Far Cry series has done what so few others have in that each game has redefined our perception of what this franchise is. The first game had you blasting through a Island of Dr. Moreau-inspired landscape, the second brought us back to reality with a hunt for an arms dealer in Africa, and now the third installment aims for a more personal experience while drawing inspiration from films like Taken and Turistas.  In the game you play as an American 20-something year old named Jason Brody who accompanies his two brothers and wealthy friends on vacation in Thailand. Being thrill seekers and adrenaline junkies the group is told about Rook Island where 'anything goes' and they decide to blindly sky dive onto it. Shortly after landing the group is taken captive by pirates led by the clearly sadistic and violently insane Vaas who plans to collect a ransom but sell them into slavery anyway. After narrowly escaping, Jason is taken in by the local natives who inpsire him to take the fight to Vaas and save his friends.  The story is beautifully crafted, the characters are vivid (thanks to phenomenal voice acting and animation), and the game's use of insanity as a focal point pays off brilliantly.  Like the previous titles, FC3 drops the player in an open environment that's just as big if not bigger than Skyrim and all of it save a smaller island is available to explore from the get-go. Populating the game world are story missions, side missions, and hidden collectibles and transportation including cars, trucks, boats, ATVs, hang gliders, and jet skis. The combat is exciting and tense and a large arsenal of weapons is at the players' disposal covering handguns, SMGs, assault rifles, LMGs, sniper rifles, shotguns, and even a bow and flamethrower.   While the story missions are always varied and great fun the side missions are repetitive and lack luster after awhile. Tracking down hidden collectibles also becomes a chore pretty quickly as the payoff for doing so is limited. Lastly while the environment looks incredibly appealing it does become stale after awhile in its lack of variety. Additionally, some of the more detail oriented players have noticed that the game world lacks some of the awesome physics and destruction features present in the PC version of Far Cry 2.  Overall though the pros greatly outweigh the cons. Far Cry 3 is a tense and brilliantly designed game that is totally worth picking up. If you're looking for something that seamlessly blends a fantastic narrative and addictive gameplay look no further. Personally I can't wait to see what they do with the next game and how the franchise will redefine itself again.",

I was planning on upgrading, but realized a whole new computer was better suited for any games I really wanted to play. Far Cry 3 was the first title I played when I got my new computer and it runs like a charm. The gameplay reminded me of Fallout 3 while the story was like that of Uncharted, these being two of my favorite modern games. I can safely say that Ubisoft has an actual videogame series that I would consider playing and revisiting, unlike the Assassin's Creed games, which is a series that has just been milked so much it has lost all the fun and exciting adventure to it's promising formula. Far Cry 3 may be repetitive and tedious at times, but it makes up for that by providing an exilarating story with some of the best characters (and voice actors) I've every witnessed on a gaming screen. I recomend this game and hopefully will be experiencing the new Far Cry 4 as well.",

            "review_text": "Far Cry 3 improves upon its predecessor in almost every way. The map, while still large, does not feel arduous to cross. There is much to see and do on every journey and the fast travel system means you spend more time in firefights and less time driving along empty roads.  The first half of the game gets a little repetitive. Liberate outpost, capture radio tower, complete side missions, rinse repeat. It is in the second half, however, where everything comes to life. The story explodes into a fantastic series of story and mission quests that build towards a very enjoyable finale. Side missions are still available and the path of the hunter quests are worth doing until equipment is fully upgraded. Sadly there is little reason to seek the hidden items apart from a minor experience boost for doing so.  The unique skills in the tattoo tree add some variety but the opportunities to use them are few and far between. More often than not you’ll find yourself picking off enemies with an assault rifle or sniper and then cleaning up with a shotgun or SMG.  One of the best aspects of Far Cry 3 are the rich characters. They have unique personalities that really stand out and give richness to interactions and their parts in the larger story. The best of these is Citra, the alluring and slightly unstable leader of the Rakyat. The contrasts drawn between her and Vaas add some entertainment between missions.  The crafting system in FC3 is accessible and the items created are very useful. Syringes provide valuable boosts and abilities and it is wise to keep a full stock at all times.  Overall I look back at the experience fondly and will remember some of the moments and action sequences for some time to come. Bravo!",

Seriously, don't bother.)  Everything falls just right in this game; hunting animals to craft larger rucksacks, wallets and ammo pouches is fun (complete with certain equipment that can't be crafted without sidequest-specific animal hides), shooting feels just inaccurate enough with assault rifles, explosions feel explosiony, fire is gorgeous, water is gorgeous, and there are SO MANY WAYS to take on enemy outposts (from brute force, to range, to stealth, and even sneaky trap-setting).  However, one detail sets this game apart for me:  The sound.  I don't mean the music, or the way footsteps fall, or any bitrate magic; I mean a very specific thing:  Echoes.  You see, when a gun fires, someone shouts, a car accelerates, or an animal roars and you are at a distance, a magical echoing effect is applied to the sounds, and there's something whimsical to hearing it. Allow an example:  You're bearing down on your targets, safe in a cliffside. They have no clue a sniper is looking down on them. You shoot, and one falls without notice. Another. Another. But maybe you miss, or shoot the fourth guy in the leg, or someone turns around and sees his body fall down. Suddenly the outpost is in panic, men scream and shout, firing their guns at things that aren't there. Then one spots you, and you hear his call of 'I SEE ONE!' ring out across the air. All this sounds cool, but as I said before, hearing it with echoes is truly something  else .  Oh but Uplay is taped on to the game.  9.99/10 - The rating level I reserve for Far Cry 3 because it is a perfect game that is hindered slightly by Uplay.",

I played as a character named Jason Brody, a tourist to the islands and let's just say Jason and the pirates who own that turf don't get along. Jason came a a tourist but somehow becomes an excellent gunman, explosives expert, master offroad driver, hunter, assassin, alchemest, spalunker, and ♥♥♥♥s one of the natives in a matter of weeks.   It's a great game.   The gameplay itself is fantastic. An open sandbox world, a world bright and tropical but I could never seem to relax knowing a pirate squad could come driving up any second. I could run around and do many different things. I could collect ingrediants to craft syrums, hunt animals for there skin and craft better quality gear, or just run around taking outposts and fixing cell towers so I could get money and afford to upgrade my weapons. The map itself is expansive, and challenging to trek without proper vehicle. When trekking an enemy could be just waiting for you over the hill, and it maybe a tiger or a bear or some ♥♥♥♥ like that. The firefights in this game get intense, and the more you go on the more intense they get. With all of thise comes experience points, these points earn you a new skill in the tree which come in really handy because they actually design the map around these skills, the more skills you have the easier it is to do things on the island, including kicking pirate ♥♥♥. I spent hours at a time playing this game emersed in it's world and it was easy to slip into the charact of Jason Brody.   The story is pretty good. It definitely kept me intriqued and motivated to continue. I could take breaks from the story whenever I wanted and just goof around on the island, there is plenty of extra stuff to do that has nothing to do with the story, and you gain experience for all of it. It's hardcore grinding that doesn't really get old because each encounter is different from the last.   There are a few things about the story and gameplay I really didn't dig. Without spoiliers- There are some strange things that happen during a knife fight with 'bosses' that isn't' really explained, it just happens and then it's not happening but no one tells Jason why and he doesn't seem to question it. There is a thing that happens with the 'lost object' and it doesn't seem to make anyone curious whatso ever, and as the player just left me feeling a bit out of the loop. I was thinking that they would explain these things eventually but just rolled the credits and still don't know. Sometimes when I was hiding behind a wall from an enemy the enemy would react as though he had seen me, when I know he couldn't have, it happened rarely but it's an annoying glitch.   You get very lmitied amount of weapon slots, and a large selection of weapons of each class so it starts to become a really tough decision about what loadout to pick, but I developed a favorite loadout and it would occasionally change up throughout the game. Ammo is very limited as well, and you have to restock your supply every so often by returning to an outpost or store, or looting it from a dead pirate.   Overall this game is only a hanful of games I've cared enough to complete in the last few years. To me, that means alot.   I give this game 9 out of 10 MF Falco's.   ",

I player Far Cry 2 and found it to be annoying, repetitive and boring, yet nice-looking. So that's what I expected from Far Cry 3 as well.  I was wrong.  Far Cry 3 is pretty, that much hasn't changed. In fact the game was so pretty that all the pretty environments, visual effects and bright colours actually made me feel physically ill sometimes, which I guess has to count against the graphics, but other than that Far Cry 3 is a gorgeous game.  However, unliked it's predecessors, Far Cry 3 has an interesting premise, that of young adults captured by pirates and struggling to escape with the assistance of native resistance warriors fighting the pirates. It has cool locations, characters and missions, and most importantly: it has an arc. The protagonist, Jason Brody, changes throughout the game. He grows on you in this weird way, and I found it unusually easy to relate to him.  The voice actors are solid, the game uses original and lifted music effectively and most of the sound effects seem top-notch.  And then there is the positive surprise! While most modern games give you something between 6-10 hours of gameplay, Far Cry 3 got me up to 22 hours, with easily 90% of the side missions untouched and much of the map still left to properly explore. If you are that kind of a person, you can easily get lost in this game and just roam the land, hunting prey, be it man or animal, and taking in the glorious scenery.   I didn't expect to, but I truly recommend this game.   Playtime: 22+ hours (single playthrough)  Ratings (1-10) Visual: 8 Audio: 9 Story: 8 Gameplay: 9 Overall: 8",

This allows you to clear camps with many different styles, but each of which is rewarding: - you can rush in all guns blazin' - you can sneak in - you can release animal - you can shoot them up from a distance with a sniper rifle - you can set whole place on fire -YOU CAN BRING RANDOM BEAR TO THEIR BASE WITH STONES and enjoy the show.  I love this kind of freedom, especially when everything is at the top of its genre - you will have trouble finding better stealth game, better action game, better jungle (you are scared and hoping that you wont find tiger/bear/... on your walks), more immersive driving (in not carsim games that is).  After all is said and done, you have this kind of freedom only in Skyrim and maybe (didn't play yet) in GTA V. For example assassins creed 3 doesn't have that - yes you can do many things in it, but those things are not interconnected and balanced to provide one great package - you have hunting there, but no reason to hunt - same goes for (awesome) ship missions, stealth is broken, bullet shield mechanic is hillarious, forest animals are almost unable to kill you... this just shows how unique far cry is.",

Good handling, sprinting, has many customizable things and fun vehicles to use.   The graphics still are top notch after a few years. The people look amazing, so do the environments, animation and lighting. Some of the vehicles look a little silly but honestly I'm nit picking at this point.  As for the story, it's pretty good for an FPS. You are on vacation and everything goes wrong, you friends are kidnapped and you have to get them back. There are many crazy parts that can be brutal. Also you get to see the transformation of Jason(Main character) from his eyes. Though I did think the ending was kind of stupid and kind of went on a little long but I don't want to ruin anything.",

It feels fun and great going from outpost to outpost or tower to tower and hunting down animals to improve your gear. You also get to watch the main character question his own mentality as he struggles to save his friends.  Overall it's a pretty amazing game, the only bad thing is the multiplayer campaign what is no-where as good as the singleplayer. It's basically just run and gun with a few booring minigames and when you can actually stealth something, due to a poor marking system and enemy AI it becomes pratically impossible. Oh and UPLAY is incredibably buggy with multiplayer, it took me about 40 minutes to finally be able to join a private match with a friend after doing some abserdly long troubleshooting.  Otherthan that, this game is a must-buy. I haven't experianced any other problems with UPLAY, but I guess that is just me being lucky.",

Its kind of surreal really, because for a game that recieved such high critical acclaim, and was so popular and FPS like, I actually genuinely liked it as an FPS.   Not because of the RPG mechanics, or the inclusion of crafting, gun variety, character development, decent main story, trippy topics like drug use, and abuse, piracy, and slavery. Well I liked all of those actually, but the shoot-em-up sections were fun. The game managed to keep a consistent tone, and actually develop itself over the course of time, in a meaningful way. It created that open world magic of going out to a location, and taking it down with your acculated ability, and weapons, but this is where is starts to fray.  Because at its core, its an FPS, its no Skyrim with guns, because thats Fallout. FC3 fails not on a fundimental level, but on an auxillery one, whereby, its not fun to explore without a solid objective, or tangible reason to be exploring. The island is just bland, empty really, sure it looks nice, but there is nothing secret to explore that cant be found by buying a loot map from stores. The game turns from that open world fun, to another rather linear progression of 'go here, get new gun, do story mission to unblock this set of new skills'. The game tries to pace a open world game, and that does not mesh well. As well, it is incredibly easy, and more deaths will be attribute to poor design, rather than lack of character skill, or weapon balence. In other words, there is more of a case of rage quit deaths, than real honourable ones.  Now dont get me wrong, even though I just spent the last 157 words bashing the game, I still think it is brillient. I would recommend it to anyone that wants an easy shooter, that would like to have a rather relaxing and enjoyable experiance like me.",

Far Cry 3 was a major development from the first 2 games, and has become without question, my most favourite game of all time. Far Cry 3 explores various themes, and carries quite an incredible storyline that is deceptively dark and powerful, even if the initial plot is very simple. I've played through Far Cry 3 at least 4 times, on every difficulty and tried different endings and choices. The first time I finished the game was by far, the most moving ending I've experienced in any game. It has great replayability, even after finishing Far Cry 4 I come back to this for the memories and unique gameplay. With amazing graphics, a gripping storyline, and such realistic gameplay, I still recommend Far Cry 3 today. I will never forget my time with Far Cry 3, it was the best experience I've ever had the pleasure to be part in. The map editor probably kept me entertained for months, and while I never played much co-op, what I did play was pretty fun. I personally prefer Far Cry 3 over 4, as it just feels more magical and special. I only hope that Far Cry 5 will return to the brutal and beautiful atmosphere that Far Cry 3 had, without completely redoing it (cough cough Far Cry 4).  So yes, Far Cry 3 is still worth every cent (and probably more to be honest). It still remains my most favourite game ever, and will for a very long time. Don't hold back on getting it, It's an unforgettable journey.",

The experience is amazing. 10/10.",

            "review_text": "After spending 90+ hours completing everything there is to do in Far Cry 3, I can safely say I haven't had this much fun in an FPS for a long time. Having the freedom to do practically anything you like, in any order you like, in any style you like, is a refreshing change from the standard-fare modern military shooter. I had so much fun doing things like, when needing a vehicle, popping a jeep driver with my Desert Eagle .50, watching the jeep slide up a hill, flip over a few times, kill the gunner in the roll, and then land perfectly upright on the road in the direction I needed it. Thank you very much!  However, the game does have a few caveats - firstly, it's as buggy as all hell, even today. Crashes to desktop on buying/selling items, restarting mission/quest checkpoints, or just entirely randomly while running around is worryingly common, so save often. I even fell through the ground and out of the world on the wingsuit once.  The UI and save system is also somewhat irksome and could've been implemented better on PC (an unfortunate leftover of the inferior console version), and the cash limitation is absurd - once you've bought all the weapons, upgrades and paint jobs, the only way to spend your wallet is to deliberately burn ammo and get yourself injured to buy armour/medicine. Not a game-breaker by any means, but annoying for a completionist like myself who wants to loot every chest, but can't because of an arbitrary cash limit - it just doesn't need to be there.  Finally, there are one or two poorly-balanced story missions that can be very difficult to complete unless you metagame it and do things like lay mines with advance knowledge of enemy spawn positions (Huntley and the plane repairs, I'm looking at you!). The plot could've done without some of the trippy, mystical stuff as well.  Despite a fair few misgivings, though: overall decent shooting, interesting world, plenty of free-form fun, and some intriguing and dark characters make for an enjoyable game. Just don't expect it to be perfect.",

            "review_text": "Far Cry 3 improves upon its predecessor in almost every way. The map, while still large, does not feel arduous to cross. There is much to see and do on every journey and the fast travel system means you spend more time in firefights and less time driving along empty roads.  The first half of the game gets a little repetitive. Liberate outpost, capture radio tower, complete side missions, rinse repeat. It is in the second half, however, where everything comes to life. The story explodes into a fantastic series of story and mission quests that build towards a very enjoyable finale. Side missions are still available and the path of the hunter quests are worth doing until equipment is fully upgraded. Sadly there is little reason to seek the hidden items apart from a minor experience boost for doing so.  The unique skills in the tattoo tree add some variety but the opportunities to use them are few and far between. More often than not you’ll find yourself picking off enemies with an assault rifle or sniper and then cleaning up with a shotgun or SMG.  One of the best aspects of Far Cry 3 are the rich characters. They have unique personalities that really stand out and give richness to interactions and their parts in the larger story. The best of these is Citra, the alluring and slightly unstable leader of the Rakyat. The contrasts drawn between her and Vaas add some entertainment between missions.  The crafting system in FC3 is accessible and the items created are very useful. Syringes provide valuable boosts and abilities and it is wise to keep a full stock at all times.  Overall I look back at the experience fondly and will remember some of the moments and action sequences for some time to come. Bravo!",

While not in a mission you have the chance to take over some hideouts, while you make the decision how to get your turf, is it taking ranged shots with a sniper or just going all in with everying you have, but don't forget to disable the alarms otherwise you will have to deal with the reinforcements. Also just going for a hunt is very enjoyable, you can encounter tigers, bears, sharks, snakes and many more. The damage is also very well made, since when you just go for a fight without even considering to hide behind cover and just stand in the open with 3+ enemies firing at you, you will most likely will lose the battle.

You 'die' too much in the story. I stopped counting at the 4th attempt on my life by Vaas. I am not done iwth the game yet but I think the writers went a bit overboard with the number of times people kill you in the story and yet somehow you miraculously survive. Not a game breaker though.  2. Your character 'Jason' falls deeper and deeper into complete bada**ness as the game progresses. This is awesome. However, I think they fell short on the voice acting here. His voice throughout still sounds pretty innocent and clueless. I would have preferred the actor put some more ...'growl' in it as he becomes more jaded with life. Again, not a game breaker.   I would recommend this game for sure. The combat is solid, the jungle is beautiful (but sadly not as flamable as the dry plains in FC2), and the finishing moves are awesome.",

Fast travel is great. 6/10  The story - The start of the story is excellent but then goes a bit downhill. The story picks up again after and gets incredible. The escapes during missions are predictable and almost always the same. Overall 9.5/10  The Inventory/upgradable bags/ammunition/slots - Really? I am only able to carry 22 bullets? This in theory could have been excellent. Instead they OVER did it and you have to spend your initial hours just hunting animals to get biggest loot bags, ammo bags, wallet, etc. The initial hours should be spent doing absorbing missions to get you addicted to the game. This broke immersion for me. The game should have started out with a decent amount of ammo and bags and give the players a CHOICE to upgrade them. Items should also be stackable. 3/10  Crafting system - Good but I can think of a few improvements that they should have made, and the items you can craft out plants should be much more powerful. I ended up not bothering. 7/10  Loot and weapon system - Varied and modifiable guns. Execllent 10/10  Skill system - Lots of choice to help define your characters playstyle and mastery. 10/10  Gameplay - Overall very positive. Great fun! 27/30",

            "review_text": "“Did I ever tell you the definition of insanity?”  Gamers, if you’re fans of first-person shooters or sandbox games, buy Far Cry 3. Buy it right now. Really, go ahead, I know Steam is open. You're reading this on it right now. I’ll wait. Squared away? Good.  Allow me to start by saying that there's a very good reason for Far Cry 3 to be called the 'Skyrim of action games.' Ubisoft Montreal put together a blockbuster with this colorful descent into a surreal and bloody madness, departing refreshingly from the bland letdown that was the game’s predecessor.  The game’s action elements are solid, boasting tight, well-polished shooting, simple and intuitive driving controls, and a suitably varied array of ♥♥♥-kickery available to players. Its pseudo-RPG elements are also pleasantly deep for an FPS game. The iterative augmentations to players’ melee and stealth abilities are particularly noteworthy, as each is often more brutally satisfying than the last, serving as fitting rewards for players, and as visceral illustrations of the main character's transformation from stranded adrenaline junkie to primal killing machine. Each ability’s visual representation as a part of an increasingly intricate series of tattoos along Jason’s forearm is a nice touch of artistry and immersion as well.   Between these abilities and Far Cry 3’s limited but effectual weapon customization options, it’s this potential for personalization that allows players to gradually carve out their own play style in Far Cry 3’s organic and flexible combat system. One may select increasingly potent health boosts, and pack a shotgun and a fistful of grenades for wrecking pirate faces. Another may opt for a more stealthy approach, relying instead upon knife takedowns, silenced guns, and environmental hazards to distract and dispatch enemies.  Like bears. In no other game may you make tactical bear-strikes. Developers, get on this. Now.  An additional co-op mode, complete with its own story arc, alongside a fairly standard competitive multiplayer mode, keep Far Cry 3’s long-term entertainment value afloat, offering multiple gaming experiences under one digital roof. That said, it’s worth noting that the game’s multiplayer modes don’t allow for near the customization or freedom as that of the single player experience, though that’s to be more or less expected. The gift that keeps on giving, however, is Far Cry 3’s admirably user-friendly map editor, which its player base has taken to creating some creative arenas with.   Sadly, Pokerface Deathmatch is not one of them.  On the technical end of things, Ubisoft obviously took their time with coding and QA testing this title. Even on mid-level gaming rigs, Far Cry 3 runs with admirable efficiency, and it’s a real treat on more powerful systems. Even on consoles, the game is gorgeous in every aspect of its presentation, from its smooth graphics and diverse soundtrack, to say nothing of the actors’ stunning performances. Regarding the latter, my hat is way, way off to Michael Mando for his performance as Vaas, the game’s first and most memorable antagonist.   The standout flaw of Far Cry 3 is that there simply isn’t enough of it. The single-player story is rather short, ends abruptly, and doesn’t have much replay value. Side missions will only last players so long, and once players clear regions of enemies, there’s no real sense that their victories are ever in jeopardy. Once you’re finished with an area’s tasks, there’s just not much reason to go back. This, coupled with the patronizing hand-holding of the game’s map function keeps Far Cry 3 from really capitalizing on the dangerous wonder of its setting.   In all, Far Cry 3 looks, feels, and plays like a startlingly entertaining amalgamation of standard FPS fare, Assassin’s Creed, and Skyrim, and damnit, I want more.

For where they wanted to take you on this story and premise it could have been fantastic but they sure failed to do it in a compelling and intelligent way. This game should be the poster child for what's wrong with modern, 'polished' game writing. Course 101.  The GAME is a lot of fun and there's a lot to do in it, perhaps too much to do in regards to repetition. Still, a lot of fun and although the story is a love or hate it affair it doesn't overly get in the way. I mean, you already know what's going to happen anyway.",

            "review_text": "Farcry 3 does a lot of things right and a few things wrong.   Let's start with the positives. The sandbox open world is absolutely beautiful. It's massive, it's lush, and you'll always see the islanders out and about doing things so it really gives the world a sense of life. Out of curiousity, I turned my graphics settings down to low and the game still looked pretty damn good. I wasn't much of a fan of the music in the game, as most of it was very basic beats, but the ambient noises are excellent and you'll always have that paranoid feeling when you hear that tiger growl off in the distance, not knowing whether it's coming after you or just passing by.  Now the negatives. The side missions can be quite repetitive. They fall into the formula of 'Go hunt this animal or Kill this guy with a knife or deliver these supplies before the time runs out.' It was hard for me not to get bored at times doing the side missions, because I've already done some redition of previously. The main campaign was pretty good. Not excellent, not just okay, but somewhere in between. The story has a lot to be desired but luckily it's held up by an excellent voice actor cast.   The crafting and skill system is pretty cool. My only complaint is I had a tendancy to have all my skills filled before the next set would open up, which is dependent on your main story progression. So there would be times where I would have 3-4 skill ponts I couldn't use because the additional skills were still locked because I hadn't made it that far in the story yet.  The game has a few quirks, but overall was a very enjoyable experience. If your a completionist, then there are tons and tons of things for you to collect and complete. Playing just through the main story took me somewhere along the lines of 18(ish) hours, but if you strive to do everything, I would be surprised if you could easily get 35+ hours of gameplay. I recommend Far Cry 3 who like first person shooters and sandbox worlds. There is tons for you to explore and story will keep you interested(just perhaps not on the edge of your seat).  I am giving the Far Cry 3 an 8/10.",

Hunting is a very importaint aspect of the game because you can't buy the upgrades, you must craft them and for that you need supplies wich you only get through hunting. Combat and stealth systems are good. The game features wide variety of weapons to choose from. There is also a weapon customizing option that can increase clip size, add a better scope or a silencer. Weapon customization also includes weapon skins. Every charecter feels different. Even the pirates, the Rakyat and privateers. Each NPC acts as it has a mind of its own. At the end I would like to point out those UPlay problems. THEY DON'T EXIST. The only problem here are the players who don't how to use it. UPlay works just fine.  10/10 - There is so much to do even after you finish the main story.",

Characters - 10/10 The main characters that you will encounter throughout your playthrough are: Jason, Vaas, Hoyt, Riley (debateable) and Dennis. A great set of characters, who are very interesting and hard to read just by their actions (I think this is a good thing).  Graphics - 10/10 For a 2012 game, the graphics are brilliant, so crisp and beautiful. The sky is awesome and some of the scenery is just unbeatable in my opinion!  Performance - 10/10 Don't really need to explain this one. The rating I have given it explains it all.  Open World - 9/10  Would be 10/10 but when you are trying to hunt and explore for instance, you are constantly being attacked by bandits or privateers, but if this wasn't a problem the game would probably be less enjoyable, I just think it could have been toned down a little bit. Apart from that, the open world is fantastic, you can hunt, explore, drive, just go on killing sprees or just admire the beautiful scenery that this game provides.  Overall - 9.5/10 I have came to this conclusion because this is a brilliant game with only a few minor problems. It is a MUST buy for all PC gamers in my opinion.",

I have learned I rather do not like the main character, at all. I don't hate him completely but he's gotten on my nerves. You run around blowing people up, whooping and holering sometimes about how fun a grenade launcher or a flamethrower is, and I agree. but you can skin a thousand and one animals, and EVERY, SINGLE, TIME, he whines about how gross it is. -.- And other things here and there just bug me about him.  The only honestly likeable characters die, (some good guys some bad guys) and it bugs me the same as some a little bit that the cover guy isn't the main villian.  As for the story, it's not terrible, but personally I'm not all for it. Sometimes dumb descisions are made but I won't fault that entirely, we're on the outside and people on the outside always see the stupid mistakes. when you're in the heat of conflict you don't think straight and mistakes always happen, but sometimes they leade to AWESOME characters dieing. T_T The ending is the ONLY descision you get to make and it's a dumb one. I won't say what happens but SPOILERS, the choice is kill your friends who you spent The Entire First Half Of The Game SAVING, or do the smart thing and don't. trust me, pick the spare your friends option, Citra isn't worth it.  Overal, gameplay superb, story lacking unless you like messed up stories, then the overall game is great.  Defintely a great game but let's be honest, Blood Dragon is Better and should have a full length game and series all It's own.",

This games still had a very decent player count for even today; April,2016. Suprisingly It stand around 1.5k.  Multiplayer is pretty much dead but....Fear not ! One of the best and fun in this games is the CO-OP Mode, it still had quite a number of player in the game,anytime. The Co-op mode had quite a chapter to play and really a BLASTING ENJOYABLE gameplay. I myself prefer the co-op more than the Campaign. It had a very detail and amazing landscape and at the same time it was intense and fill with andrenaline rush. I'm wondering why is no one mention bout this great awesome co-op mode feature?! If you like FPS game &amp; great coop one like L4D2, where you can blast ur way through with friend or other player. Why not try grab FAR CRY 3 and head into co-op mode before try the -.-' Grrrrr...clunky menu campaign. Then you decide whether to refund not this pieces of Relic. Ka Kite.   ATTENTION !! Love FPS??!!

            "review_text": "Come the white savior and face your insanity through substantial substance abuse.  There are a couple of improvements from the last game, such as no more re-spawning enemies at checkpoints, NO MORE MALARIA SHOTS, more advanced upgrade system, better presented faction war, more meaningful exploration, more open world (instead of labyrinth-like ravines of Far Cry 2), etc.  The story:  You play as a rich white guy who probably never worked a day in his life and who came to the island with his friends and family to relax, jump out of airplanes and be 'the king of the world'. Short time after you and your buddies get captured and butt ♥♥♥♥♥ by a pirate named Vaaaaaaaas. Eventually, after escaping, you find out that you possess magical-primal-instinct-killer-powers which you develop and which enable you to kill pirates, run for miles without stopping, rescue your friends (or whoever is left) and liberate the dark-skinned native population on the island who accept you as one of their own and eventually come to revere your mere presence. Typical White Savior theme, it's kind of sickening. Dances with the Wolves, Avatar, Blood Diamond, The Last Samurai, anyone?  The graphics:  The graphics are okay despite the fact that this is one of the few games to fully utilize quad core processors. The jungle is static: no vegetation moves on the island because there is no wind (except for when it's raining), the waves always move though. . There's some destructibility but not much. The field fires are back though which is good. The drawing distance kind of sucks though, there's this constant distance blur and it gets even worse when you are hand-gliding. It just doesn't look crisp or sharp enough so it kind of hurts your eyes, aesthetically speaking. To add to the injury you sometimes see trees appearing in the distance and you also see massive texture load almost every time you spawn at a safe house. The water is just okaish. If you swim under water and look up you will see this weird pre-rendered texture of the same waves which looks pretty bad. Think of Crysis (5 years ago) and how that game managed to create unique wave patterns distinct from each other.  One thing that does help is the field of view which can be set at 110 degrees. I honestly thought I was playing on a 2560x1600 monitor.  The physics:  The physics are mostly well done. You can't just keep jumping and climbing everything like in Skyrim. And when you fall down the hill or you don't just hover in air, you slide down and hurt yourself. However, at the same time you can jump and infinite amount of time and run and swim for as long as you want – no stamina whatsoever. The climbing is done pretty well.  The gameplay:  it's Consolized somewhat. For instance if you want to sneak up on someone and knife them you could easily do it without breaking a sweat. For one thing, the enemies' field of vision is extremely limited both during the day and night (if I recall, it was much easier to sneak up on enemies in Far Cry 2 especially after you save enough to buy a stealth suit). You can sneak up on them even when they are supposed to be seeing you and the detection indicator won't even go op. Then, when you are about 10 feet away from them you can click the melee button and knife them easily even if they see you for a second, I kid you not. I forget how many outposts I took out just by using my knife. Also, the menus suck. You go into your loot sack and it's cluttered with stuff you collected. It's not organized in any way in case you want to clear up some room. It would help if the yellow leaves and red leaves were actually pained YELLOW and RED on the screen instead of the game indicating they were through text. Same goes for animal skins. Just color them in appropriately, not too hard.  There's also no more quick save, which works in some linear games with the whole checkpoint system but not here. You HAVE to finish missions before you can manually save (by going to your main menu) or your will lose some progress like crafting and collecting items. Not having the ability to quicksave diminishes the RPG quality of this game in some ways. For instance you go on a mission to shoot 5 deer with a specific weapon. You kill 2 and decide to craft something. Then you fail to kill the other 3 because you miss and run out of bullets. Mission failed. Start over, and craft another item AGAIN. Same goes for loot and collecting hard to reach relics. Also, why only 3 save slots? The two previous games had an unlimited amount of save slots. Why? Why can't I save the best moments of the game?  What they also did is replace the hidden diamond briefcases with boxes of loot that are always shown on your mini-map. Why? Same goes for plants that are to be harvested. That simplifies the game in many ways, so you never really end up searching for something because it's always up there on the minimap. Far Cry 2 didn't have this problem (you didn't have a minimap and you had REALLY look for them diamonds using your proximity tracker). However, at the same time you didn't really collect as much stuff in Far Cry 2 as you do here.  The constant notifications in the upper left corner are also annoying. Seriously, I'm trying to explore that part of the island, I KNOW that going to the Medusa ship is the mission objective, yet I am getting that notification a few times every minute and the only way to make it go away is to complete the actual mission.  The enemy tagging via camera is back from the first game. Only this time, once you tag your enemies you can see them through the terrain! How convenient! Just like in Hitman: Absolution.  The safe houses are still here however, now you can buy and sell your gear at any safe house! Why? You don't need to travel to those very few people who trade your diamonds for weapons and upgrades. Also, you can't sleep at safe houses anymore and pick the time of the day that you want to complete your objective. However, that's hardly relevant now since the day/night cycle now entirely depends on how fast you are moving in the world.  Far Cry 2 healing is back!  The skinning of animals isn't really skinning, it's just taking the same chunk of flesh; be it a turtle, a shark, or a giant carnivorous bird.  You also can't see your legs or cast a shadow…figures.  Viewing any foe or animal through optics automatically tags them, enabling you to see them through walls during firefights, thereby taking out lots of challenge out of the game.  Most animals also take several shots to the head to die. WTF?  The game also features a Kill-Zone type of cover system which is welcome in an FPS.  The AI:  95% of all AI's look alike. Most of them wear red for some reason. Quite often they are as dumb as a stick insofar as taking them out by one goes since most of them probably have extreme cases of near-sightedness. However, when they start ganging up on you and start calling in reinforcements then you got to think quick.  -The weapons:  Pretty decent, the kickback is sometimes not enough though, feels too arcadish. There's some customization there and there, like better scope, extending magazine. The constant lack of ammo forces you to savor your shots. Also, I don't like the way new guns become available to you. Basically new weapons get unlocked when you disable radio towers. How is that relevant to you being able to buy new weapons from your safe house lockers now?  Co-Op is fun but lacks replay value since it's basically a skirmish. In some ways it feels more like a competition rather than a cooperative buddy experience.  Multiplayer is pretty solid, I must say. What's annoying though is constantly getting the temporary killer instinct ability and being able to see through walls for some time. I also like how when the team loses, the best player from the team is granted freedom by the victorious team.   All in all,decent game that sucks you in",

I don't say its bad but through the story I am expecting something new to happen in the open world like adding some badass bases. The script scene were well done but also some non-script scenes(burning drugplantation). Something that i also want to mention for experienced FPS gamer: the KI acts dumb and it won't change if you turn up the difficulty(only taking more damage, more enemies). Last but not least the 'multiplayer'. I don't know why or for what reason Ubisoft tried to implement it. It is (in my opinion) useless. There are some decent things like the way it shows you where the enemys bullets hit. I played it for 3h and stopped.

            "review_text": "Alright, where to begin...  The game is completed, story wise. I would say i haven't enjoyed a game that much for quite some time. Story was great, although would have prefered the villain be done little better. The main villain of the game was little unneccesary. Not complaining, i had fun either way. Vaas was definitely the most well made character in that game by far, they completely nailed it.  This game has a lot of side activities to do, i mostly did story, which was around 20 hours. I did play on the master difficulty, which was even more fun and quite challenging at the same time. I liked moments where i had to think throughout my actions to make sure i succeed.   Animal hunting is also interesting addition to the game, i actually liked hunting animals. The purpose of hunting animals is for the hide you use to craft from additional weapon slots (up to 4) to inventory slots. You can craft medicine, boosters etc by cutting different plants. Also getting better upgrades require better quality hides from animals.  I absolutely loved the driving mechanics in this game. It really feels like driving a real car, with a little extreme aspect added to it. Very responsive steering and accelerating in general, even handbrake was useful. Crashing was quite realistic.  I am not sure about the AI behaviour since i played on the highest difficulty, but from what i experienced- AI is quite active, compared to some games. Even though i used stealth in most cases, they still discovered dead bodies of their comrades and were alerted right away which made it more challenging to do stealth, i liked that a lot too.  Not only crafting, but skills were interesting too. There were basically 3 types of styles you could end up doing- I picked stealth. You can acquire skills by getting XP from stuff you do. When you lvl up you can pick a skill, every skill adds a part to your tattoo on your left hand. I really liked how it transformed into a pretty cool tattoo in the end.  World is quite huge and environment is really gorgeous. I loved gliding over huge mountains and just looking at the nature.   There are also collectables... 4 types i think-&gt; chests, relics, memory cards and lost messages.  There were minor things that bothered me a little. For example quite annoying was when after a cutscene you had to do something and you failed- you had to watch the cutscene all over again. Made me rage few times :D I wish there was an option to skip the cutscene after you've seen it already once.  For now that's all i can remember about the game, still going to do all the side missions and get all the collectables some time in the future.  To sum up i'd say this is best of Far Cry so far(even better than 4). If you want to play it and enjoy the hell out of it, play on the highest difficulty, makes the game last longer ;) Surprisingly works stealth quite well in this game, which is unusual for such straight-forward games. Make sure you know what style you wanna go and make your skill decisions wisely ;)  'For the sake of my friends...or Citra?!' 'Did I ever tell you the definition of Insanity?'   I'd rate the game 9.0/10.0 Screw you cutscene and Hoyt :)",

Aside from the story there is a lot of things to do, freeing camps, un-hacking radio towers by climbing them one by one, producing all of your different bad upgrades and getting new equipment and armory.  The gameplay is smooth, and I had barely and problems with the controls, even thou I admit, Jason could try not getting hurt when jumping down a small height, and that its unlogical he pulls out 7 bullets one after another or just adds a new bandage on his arm everytime when getting hurt.  Overall I gotta say that this game was awesome. I often drifted off the story, freeing camps, climbing the towers or collecting stuff, because even that was so much fun. Id say the story itself is about 8-10 hours long, and this game is definitly worth its money.",

Having said that, this is like far Cry2 in Far Cry (1) settings. It's a go get, do this, mission quest. Unlike far Cry which was about mercs and a crazy scientific experiment.   That does make Far Cry 3 a bit of a grind, albeit a good grind. I don't see myself doing much after the main quest is over. I mean I can't see me collecting every loot chest, relic, lost-letter, etc. There is no point to it really, so that part's just a grind, because there's hundreds of them.  Liberating outposts is better than expected. Getting in and cutting off the alarm before the pirates signal help is rewarding. Plus you get extra exp for doing it without an alarm going off. Another place where it excels is missions in the main quest take you to amazing places. The sets they send you to are a bit Tomb Raider style, without the puzzles. All the up-sides then.  It is addictive. I liberate one outpost and think I'll just do another, and another. Then I might finish with a main quest mission. Then another outpost, including hunter mini-quests gained at the outpost.  If it was just a hint more Far Cry (1), I would rate it higher. Also, why oh why didn't they put an inventory/progress quick-save key on. We can go to the main menu and save progress/inventory. It's diabolical they didn't give us a hotkey.",

Sure but there are boat races, taking over enemy bases, shooting galleries and a bounty board for animals and people and some extra missions besides just the main mission.

However there is one mission that is totally stealthy but I found it be fun and easy. The game does have a crafting system but its not very deep but its fun to use. The game does go off the tracks with two boss fights that are strange. The last boss fight makes no sense at all. So I would take off half a star for that. The rest of the game is brilliant.

Far cry 3 has one of the best villians in video gaming history, Vaas Montenegro. Unfortunatley, the game falls short towards the end story-wise and does limit your the open world experience in the last few missions. Boss fights are extremely dissapointing and will have you performing QTEs in a knife battle that could have been so much more.These are the only cons I found in the game that affected me majorly although I did come across some sound issues with NPCs. The voice acting for the main characters is great and there wasn't a single bad character I can think of. However some NPC natives of the island when speaking had muffled dialogue that seemed out of place in an ultimately well voice-acted game.  Overall, Far Cry 3 is a fantastic experience for any gamer and if you haven't played it yet make sure to pick it up before Far Cry 4 comes out.

When I became A PC gamer this was the first title I bought and this version is much better than the Xbox version. There was a limit cap for the map editor that prevented you from only placing 16 IA in the test map witch sucked so bad !!!! By far my bigest complaint. On PC there is no such restriction only what your machine can handle. I spent Countless hours playing the map editor creating maps not for publishing but for creative and exciting single player experiences. The single player is very fun open world with alot of wildlife and enemys to encounter along your path in becoming a great warrior. You must hunt the wild life in order to upgrade your ability to carrie more items and ammo. The storyline really kept me interested for the most part and I would have to say my favorite moment in the game is when the Dr. asks you to go find shrooms in some cave and you tripp out hardcore lol. The weapons are impressive you can go in guns blazing or take a more stelth approach depending on what is in your inventory. Anyone a fan of open world FPS must play this. Unfourtinately You need uplay to play this title and I was dissapointed to learn how hard it is to find friends on uplay witch makes sharing your custom maps and multiplayer a difficult experiance, for that I am knocking a point off. Also Not allowing players to drive in multiplayer was a huge turn off.....What the hell was ubisoft thinking? Thats another point gone. Still a great game 8/10",

Aside from the story there is a lot of things to do, freeing camps, un-hacking radio towers by climbing them one by one, producing all of your different bad upgrades and getting new equipment and armory.  The gameplay is smooth, and I had barely and problems with the controls, even thou I admit, Jason could try not getting hurt when jumping down a small height, and that its unlogical he pulls out 7 bullets one after another or just adds a new bandage on his arm everytime when getting hurt.  Overall I gotta say that this game was awesome. I often drifted off the story, freeing camps, climbing the towers or collecting stuff, because even that was so much fun. Id say the story itself is about 8-10 hours long, and this game is definitly worth its money.",

The game does allow you to craft items, but only a set list of items. Once an item is crafted, crafting it again is not an option. You do collect herbs, but they are just classified into red, blue, green, etc.. The actual herb itself does not matter. This game is nothing like Skyrim. It does have several glitches and graphical tears which make it seem as if the game was rushed. However, aside from the issues, the gameplay is on par with Far Cry 2, and the story line is a big improvement. The character development is amazing.",

Stealth is neat, until you figure out it works too well. It's easy to upgrade all your ammo pouches/slings/weapons. Once you discover the sniper rifles can be silenced, it's a cake walk to get in and out of places.  Nothing is new. Outside of the main story (which is neat with the LSD trips), all of the side quests and exploration ARE ♥♥♥♥ING BORING. Skyrim would tease you with caves when a surprise quest or loot. FC3 does not have either. All the weapons are the same and have the same attachments as every other shooter in the market. No fancy tribal weapons other than the bow, too.  Repetitive. Oh god... same stuff over and over. It's not Far Cry 2 bad, but it's still bad, especially later in the game.  Story is the only new thing about FC3. It's pretty neat and I'd recommend it just for that. Speaking of story: If you can, just get Spec Ops: The Line instead. Why? Because The Line has a memorable plot, FC3 does not.  FC3 isn't special and only worth $25~30. 7/10",

When you go down a sloped hill, you'll slide, when you fall off of a ledge you'll tumble and have to relocate your finger. The coolest part is the games ecology. There's a whole ecosystem built into the game of animals and plants. You can see tigers chasing deer in the jungle, crabs scuttling across beaches, komodo dragons eating pirates. And the gunplay is spot on. Aside from the gameplay, the story is also great. One of my biggest gripes with Far Cry 2 was the ♥♥♥♥ poor voice acting, but this game... this game did it right. Vass is as intimidating as a Batman villian and just as twisted. This game puts all other open world shooters to shame. The best thing to happen to games since Red Dead Redemption.",

            "review_text": "Ah, what to say about this game. You play as Jason Brody and the game takes place on Rook Island. Beyond that there is an adventure of killing, hunting, and occasional drug use.   The basic premise of the game is that you, your friends, your girlfriend and your brothers are all on vacation going around and living it up. Well surprise, surprise when you get kidnapped and taken by local psycho Vaas. The game spans across a large island and smaller sub island in the later part of the game that has you trying to relocate everyone who was taken before they are killed or sold off, and enacting revenge against both Vaas and Hoyt for what they've taken from you. What stands in your way is the feral wildlife and once sane residents of the island. Vaas commands an army of crazies that terrorize the people and you join the Rakyat. The Rakyat are citizens who have had their share of Vaas and fight to have him put down and reclaim their island. A sort of red vs. blue take on it, with animals being the purple team.   The psychedelic drug trips are always interesting. Walking across a walkway of old CRT TV's while seeing things to your sides, hearing voices from the past- it all comes together to throw things into disarray. Interesting imagery and vibrant colours that pop out or draw attention make the sections very enjoyable to look at, and you will be when they limit your walking speed to a crawl, which is something I personally hate in any game, this being no different. Past this brief description I won't say much in regards to this. I feel the little drug trips were something better experienced first hand than anything else.   The game features a FPS and RPG-esque like gameplay style that blends together quite well I feel. You earn the standard EXP that you would expect to see in RPG games, and more so if you dispatch of the enemies with more finesse. Headshots give more, and special kills with the machete earn the most. This EXP is then used to give you skill points which make Jason excel in his island life. With three skills trees to choose from, varying in combat, stealth, and survival aspects, you have some choice in how you want to see your character grow; however, it is possible to get all of the skills in the game before you finish it. I got them all about 65%-70% of the way through, but I personally tried to get as much EXP as possible because it I feel it added to the challenge and fun of the game. Remaining undetected while capturing enemy outposts and chain kills with the machete and the like,so your experience may be completely different.   Rook Island is nothing if not the biggest culmination of hateful animals in gaming history. I've been attacked by more tigers, bears, sharks, alligators, leopards, and stray dogs with rabies than I fired bullets throughout my journey. I've been attacked by more tigers than I have anything else put together. I get the feeling any fear I would have of a tiger in real life is lessened because I have just gotten used to seeing them and then defending myself before they try and maul me. One word of advice I can give is to keep a shotgun handy. The best way to deal with any animal you have to hunt is a shotgun, or a bow but it is not as powerful on animals as it is humans.   The visuals of the game are fantastic. Sprawling landscapes and deep waters, claustrophobic and haunting caverns, and the great outdoors. The graphics for the game are great, it looks fantastic most of the time, odd graphical issues rear themselves every now and then, but the entirety of the visuals is grand. Deep blues for the water, lush green for the vegetation, thick blacks and bright lights to assist the atmosphere, these all combine to give a memorable experience worth taking in when they present themselves, which is common. I often found myself over looking the lands from a radio tower or cliff face and seeing a near awe inspiring world- the sheer number of screenshots that I took of the game offer no less to the game than what I am describing. I would recommend, while playing, to just take a few moments to breathe the game in. It really is something worth looking at when the over-saturation of games with painfully crippled colour palettes have flooded and overflowed our vidya market.   To keep this incoherent and already too long review of going on any further I will wrap it up here. This game is one I highly recommend, especially considering I put in near 40 hours and beat it in less than a week, which is something I don't do at all. The visuals of the game in both the worlds presentation and the mind bending visuals of the drag addled trips through your psyche set my heart fluttering because of my deep love of anything psychological or similar. The gameplay was entertaining, offering a high integrity towards playing how you want, even going as far as covering some outposts with grass that you can then blanket in flames. The sound design, quality, and soundtrack sealed the deal together offering excellent fidelity and mood/theme fitting tracks and ambiance.   Overall, this is a game I highly recommend. Even more so when you take into consideration the game goes under $10 during large sales. What excuse is there to not pick this up and live it?",

The gameplay has decent variation and is pretty fun, as it provides a significant amount of choices/options on how to complete most missions (However, outposts get quite annoying quite fast, as there are far too many of them in the game). The story is mostly well told and is mildly interesting, although what really stands out are the characters, for better or for worse. Ironically, your character, Jason, is one of my most hated protagonists of all time, yet the first villian, Vaas, is probably one of my favorite villians of all time. Despite its flaws, Far Cry 3 has enough thrilling gameplay to stand out among other FPS titles, and should entice you to heavily consider buying this game, ESPECIALLY if it happens to go on any sort of Steam sale.",

The bad? No game is perfect and FC3 does have some defects. The non-story character models are lame and there is only a handful of them, attack of the clones much? Although this is can be a great sandbox game, you will eventually run out of outposts to capture. (This was remedied by adding an option to reset all outposts which is great). The crafting is an amazing feature but it is actually very shallow. A more in-depth crafting system would have made the game that much more fun. The economy in general is gimmicky, new guns and mods can be acquired rather easily.   Overall this is an outstanding game and worth every sacond of your precious game time.   9/10.   ",

I played the first Far Cry twice and promptly uninstalled Far Cry 2 after 30 minutes of getting tired of enemy respawns and fetch quests. This latest sequel is a derivative of both, hoping to glean one-man-army tactical fighting situations from each, yet the story is—often comically—just interesting enough to keep you engaged to see what remote-jungle-island-induced wackiness awaits you next.  In certain parts, it seeks to shock simply for the sake of shocking. Gameplay-wise, it's a combination of the grittiness of Dead Island with the over-the-topness of Borderlands. It's trippy enough to hold your interest, yet disposable enough to make your maniacal killing machine dreams come true.",

I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes rpg's, adventure games, story driven titles, or any game that makes you feel like an all around badass. This game is a combination of all of those things. Whether its jumping off a cliff and literally 'Spreading your wings and flying away' (If you've played the game, you know what I mean), Hunting endangered species to make your shiney new wallet, on the dangerous adventure to save your friends from a mentally insane pirate with charasmatic skills so impressive that you find yourself laughing at the most dire situations, or liberating pirate outposts and radio towers; you will spend hours upon hours exploring what this amazing experience has to offer. But thats enough good things to say about Far Cry 3. Let's take a look at the bad things:   CONS   - Mulitplayer is nothing new. Better off playing Call of Duty ( only time I'll ever say that)  - Co op is merely missions. Not horrible if you're ok with only having the ability to do missions. No co op open world action for you.     OVERALL    Characters   You play as Jason Brody, a normal guy who goes on vacation with his friends. After being captured by Vaas and his pirate army, he makes a daring escape. Afterwards, spending the rest of his time on the island rescuing each of his friends one at a time and also taking part in a war against the pirates. Fighting along side a group called the Rakyat lead by Citra, Vaas's own sister, Jason finds himself torn between fighting a war and finding his friends.

            "review_text": "Ubisoft should be commended for their ability to tinker with the Far Cry series. While they didn't initially develop the first game, once Crytek signed a deal with EA, Ubisoft could have just left the Far Cry series to rot. Instead, we got a rather interesting sequel with a totally different setting and style of gameplay.  The main problems with Far Cry 2, though, are a lack of meaningful side content, horrible navigation and a rather pointless open-world to explore. While there were moments of beauty and the AI was super deadly, the game ended up being a bit of a drag. It simply wasn't fun for a majority of the campaign, even if it's fleeting moments of entertainment were blissful.  Far Cry 3 took things even further. In adapting a more complex story, the game is immediately more urgent than it's predecessor. While I can't say that all the characters are fully fleshed out human beings, at least having a motivation to explore a jungle island makes sense. The villain is quite a trip.  The island is also more conveniently spaced out. Instead of a vast terrain devoid of life and fuana, almost every area on the 'Rook Islands' contains something to do. Those somethines usually end up being random loot, hidden treasures, animals to hunt for upgrades or outposts to capture for quick travel points.  Quick travel really is what helps move this game along. It may end up being a bit too easy, but not having to trek a quarter mile to get to the next mission is a joy. It keeps to engaged in the story while also opening the possibility to indulge in some of the side missions.  I do have to say that the driving is beyond awful. Far Cry 2 managed to get that one better. The boss battles are also hugely underwhelming. As manic as some of the antagonists can be, finishing them with QTEs is pretty lame.  I also don't know if I enjoy the Radio Tower quests. They are functionally the same as the viewpoints from Assassin's Creed. Ubisoft just loves homogenizing their titles into one super game (which ended up being the deplorable Watch_Dogs). It is cool to see the vistas, but it feels like a missed opportunity to do something more unique.  I also kind of dislike the main player character. Everything in his world seems catered toward a male audience. While that is mostly a personal complaint, I don't see how a female gamer would find anything interesting about this. The 'love interest' (if you can even call her that) is so bland, but she shows a lot of skin, so clearly shes targeted at a male demographic.  I can't really come up with any other complaints. Far Cry 3 is just stellar throughout. It may be a bit on the easy side and have some heavily scripted missions, but it's just super fun. That almost every little distraction provided actually provides bonuses to the player is super great. More games should allow their side missions to be meaningful.  So if you can get past some of the story issues and lack of difficulty, I would recommend this game. It's got a pretty decent length and even has co-op. You will more than likely spend a good deal of time playing it.  8/10",

The pacing is very very poor (sometimes astonishingly so), and there are several points in the story that drag badly. The writer claims that this is actually a parody of FPS' (it's not), that he's tricking the player (he doesn't), and that the endings are like soooo deeeeeep man (they aren't). All in all be prepared for an awesome first half, then a goddawful second because they couldn't for the life of them figure out how to end this thing. Ultimately it peters out into a lame Heart Of Darkness rip-off, with annoying characters, and bad missions. The fun of the gameplay (and Vaas) is enough to make up for it for most players, but if you like getting heavily invested in a story or your protagonist I'd suggest looking elsewhere until inevitable Gaben-fueled sales kick this down to about $20 or so.",

Plus, the equipment needed to finish missions are also very interesting with customization available for a good price.  Nothing to be disliked I guess... at least for me.

            "review_text": "Well I know it's been out for awhile now and I am definitely looking forward to Blood Dragon but I figured I'd give this one a shot. The game is really immersive and theres ALOT to do. You won't find another open world FPS out there like this. The gameplay is great and there is SO MUCH to do. I finished the single player campaign a few days ago yet there is other side missions and collectibles to keep me going.  With all that said lets move on to the story, now the story isn't really as imaginative as it could be and while sometimes interesting the story in this game isn't what shines. More importantly the main character Jason Brody just comes off to be a big ♥♥♥♥♥♥-bag and one of the most unlikable protagonists in video game history ever to me.  Why? Well:  1. His tone is whiney alot of the time. Plus EVERYTIME he skins an animal whether its the 1st time he does it or the 1000th time he often makes remarks about it being grotesque and disgusting...hard for me to believe he's such a badass warrior if he can't handle skinning an animal without being such a baby about it.  -MAJOR SPOILER ALERT- 2. The way he treats his girlfriend throughout the game is downright awful. Lisa is probably the most likable character in the game and shes definitely the kindest. Jason is constantly arguing with her and even ends up ♥♥♥♥ing some crazy tribal ♥♥♥♥♥ who is equal as unlikable as he is. To top it off he decides to leave her to stay on the island. If you pick the bad ending he kills his girlfriend and joins the tribe. After ♥♥♥♥ing the tribal ♥♥♥♥♥ again she ends up killing him so at least they don't reward you for the bad ending. The good ending is where he finally decides to leave with his girlfriend and friends off the island. Yet its insane how everything is magically fixed and after all that ♥♥♥♥ she would still stay with him when clearly she deserves better. However there are some redeemable qualities about Jason such as his rive to save his brother, and his overall determination. But it still doesn't erase his overall douchbaggery. -SPOILER END-  The only other complaint I have about this game is that the multiplayer is awful. I attempted loading up a CO-OP game and waited while the loading screen went on for over 30 MINUTES. Absolutely atrocious. I gave up and looking it up I saw that the multiplayer wasn't that great anyway. If you get this game, just stick to the single player campaign which is still very good and amazing. Overall, this game is well worth getting and the problems it has are far outweighed by the deeply immersive and enjoyable gameplay. And even through the somewhat half-♥♥♥♥♥ storyline the cinematics are spectacular to say the least. I'm now looking forward to Blood Dragon which comes out on the 1st I believe.",

            "review_text": "One of the most amazing First person action shooters I've ever played. With amazing graphics, story telling, and gameplay, Farcry 3 is sure to make your mind explode. One of the major strong points of the game is the open world feature. This is prominent in all of the Farcry games, but in Far cry 3, the setting, Rook Island, is by far the best. The map is massive, estimated to be 4-5 square miles. It's full of different wildlife, such as sharks, lions, deer, and lizards. The main biome in the map is jungle, but there is also beaches, mountains, and open plains. Relating to the map, the graphics are fantastic. It is one of the best looking PC games I've seen in awhile. If you see the first screenshot I've posted, the draw distance is very large, and everything looks great at a distance. The character models are also very good. Faces look amazing, and the devs also payed attention to scars, pores, and moles/freckles. The scenery is beautiful, one of the most attracting parts of the game I would have to say. Walking through the forest alone is amazing. It blew my mind. Apart from visuals, the game also does a very good job with gameplay. All throughout the entire game, you had options, going stealthy or going loud and getting into a big fire fight. The guns in the game are also very balanced as well, each one has it's ups and downs. Sliding is also another cool feature in FC3. Sliding can help you quickly dodge bullets or get into cover to escape enemy vision. Apart from all of that, a new feature in FC3, crafting, is also very cool. Hunting animals will get you hide, which you can turn into a bag to create an extra weapon slot, or extra weapon ammo, or tons of other things. This was one of my favorite features in the game by far. The core of the game, storytelling, is the most appealing part of the game. The main character's name is Jason Brody. Him and his friends get trapped on an island known by Rook island, which is controlled by drug lord pirates. The main goal of the game is to rescue all of your friends and kill the main antagonist, Vass. You travel to many different parts of the map in search of them, and meet many new people in the process, such as Citra, who is a leader of a clan/tribe/group. A big part of the story is the dynamic characters. For example, the main character, Jason, undergoes so much throughout the entire story. He starts as one person, and ends up as an entirely different person. It's very entertaining to go through these changes with him. I really got attached to him as a character, and was very sad when the game ended. Speaking of the game ending, the while campaign is long, it took me a week of playing 2-3 hours per day to beat it, and I enjoyed every minute. Another thing I'd like to call out, which isn't very important to the key functions of the game, is the soundtrack. FC3's soundtrack is pure bliss. The music starts playing at the best possible times, and it sounds amazing when it does. The composer/producer, Brian Tyler, did an outstanding job. You can listen to it here:         YouTube™ Video:  Far Cry 3 - Brian Tyler - Soundtrack. Full OST.(Radio&amp;Club)&nbsp;",

However, I manage to squeeze about 40 hours (after 2 playthroughs for both endings) out of the single player, so It's not that concerning. Co-op was fun, but more of a novelty, and many people (at least on PC) never seem to play co-op. Competetive multiplayer was as clunky and laggy as it could get. Ignoring this, it's your standard FPS Multiplayer. Choose your loadout, level up, get killstreaks, etc. When it works, it works well, but it's not really anything to get hyped for.

In the past, Splinter Cell was one of my favorite franchises and I followed it very closely. I am still familiar with the forever-old/young Sam Fisher but his current adventures don't interest me. Blacklist was such an awful mess that I couldn't be bothered to finish the first campaign level. And that was playing it on console. But a lot of the mess that is Splinter Cell Blacklist involves the core game mechanics including the 'stealth' system, which is the same exact detection system used in Far Cry 3. All the way down to the HUD graphics and sounds. Despite the massive failure that is the detection system used in Blacklist, that same system works enormously better in Far Cry 3. The levels of detection and suspicion along with the difference in game play styles made for a very good fit between Far Cry 3 and the stealth system also used by Splinter Cell Blacklist. Without going extremely in-depth about the specific differences between how the same system works differently in both games, I raise one question. Why is there no prone position in either game???!??!  Whew. Sobre todo I very much enjoyed Far Cry 3. It looks awesome graphically, has a compelling story and game mechanics that work. Only real complaint is that it seemed someone got cut short on the development side and some parts are lacking including some of the story but not a lot of it, just some. Play it!",

Far Cry 3 continues on the foundation of Far Cry 2 except it's not as punishing in terms of equipment, by which I mean that you don't need to swap your weapon for a new one or repair them after firing them once.   + Ammo isn't too hard to come by. You pick it off fallen enemies or use the cash you scavenge to refill your stock at safehouses.  + To heal you actually need medicine which is acquired by crafting it using green (types of) plants that you collect in the jungle. You don't regenerate all your health (you start out with 2 slots of health) by just standing around, stepping away from the more commonly used auto-heal-regen these days. + The soundtrack is lovely. + Amazing scenery!  - Day/night cycle mechanic based on your movement, both WASD and mouse. You can stand perfectly still (WASD) but still move time forward by wiggling your mouse. - Wonky AI at times. If one enemy detects you they all know where you are even if it's never announced (by a shout/gunfire/etc), even if said enemy only detected you AS you performed the silent takedown. - Platforming (for climbing signal towers among other things) can be tricky. Ledges that can be climbed are marked in a certain way but you can't climb them unless you are given the indicator to climb them. Except that you can if you spam your jump-button, unless it doesn't trigger because you spammed it.  All in all - very much recommended!",

Over the next few months, I sunk dozens upon dozens of hours into Dark Souls and more (when you include Wiki time and Xbox 360 horseplay), and horsed around in Max Payne 3, but of the three games I got two years ago, THIS is the one I felt most compelled to finish. (Still haven't -- and I only finished Dark Souls because I could, I was content to just pvp all the time). Alas, life gets in the way and after months of on-and-off play, I didn't really play FC3 again until a week ago.  I am plowing through FC3 now, because on my birthday, my sister got me FC4 for my Xbox One. Before I have yet another addition to my pileup of unfinished/unstarted games, I wanted to give the earlier installment all my attention. All the praise it got in fall 2012 is much deserved.  The story is great, the characters are a little flat but energetic enough to make believe in their fictional lives and personalities. I am given direction and guidance in an open-world game while being encouraged to go my own way. The gunplay and stylistic elements of combat are as good as any great shooter and the depth of the loot just enough to keep me interested in changing it up and getting new gear as I plunder Rook Island.  As for the islands themselves, they are a blast to explore. I never finished the original Far Cry when I played it on my PC about 9 years ago, but I remember that game and Crysis (which was also from Crytek, the original makers of FarCry) having some of the most immersive and interesting envrionments to explore in most of the first-person games I have EVER played (in FarCry I would go crouch/prone somewhere and just spy on the enemy camps, listening to their banter and figuring out ways to mess with them. Because of all the dicking around I'm not really sure how the game started or where it was taking me to, lol. I have a similar case with Borderlands 1 and 2). This game accomplishes the same feat of wonder, danger and personality. The blood of adventure runs through its veins.  My only gripe is that Far Cry 3 reuses too many assets (NPC voices, filler dialogue, etc.) and that the enemy groups don't adapt to you so much as you makeing them dance like puppets. The multiplayer has some balance/depth issues as well but it works for what it is, and is fun and fast while being tactical to a degree.  For the record, I've never finished a Bethesda game either, so Far Cry 3 will get special honours as the first open-world immersive experience I've finished in the current modern era of gaming. Kudos, Ubisoft.  Going back to my speel in the beginning of this review, yes, I will drop FarCry 3 for a while, but I intend to keep playing this in the years to come. Rook Island is my hunting ground, and I want to hunt.  9/10 -- the game is timeless. Could've rated it higher if it had more juice to the inventory/loot and the NPC AI behaviour and assets, and the sidequests.",

            "review_text": "I bought Far Cry 3 during one of the -80% sales. It's not that I wasn't excited, I had seen Vaas in previews and that was intriguing enough. I also remembered Far Cry 2 fondly. It's just that I was a little bored with big budget shooters.  My first impression of the game was that it was predictable, shallow, and cliche, but that the gameplay itself was pretty fun. The RPG aspects were cool, I liked planning ahead in the skill trees, deciding what kind of fighter I wanted to be. Overall it just seemed like a big shooter playground. Blow things up, shoot a lot of people, leave c4 on roads and blow up a passing jeep full of pirates, etc. I played the game casually for quite awhile, just opening it up to have a little fun before I had to go to work. However by the time I finished the game I felt differently.  The gist of the story is that you're a rich white male in his 20's, who goes vacationing in the islands. Pirates capture you and your friends, and now it's up to you to save them all. The natives of the island are trying to war against the pirates, but they need a magical white man to save them, because they're just brown savages etc. Typical Pocahontas/Avatar thing. However, the deeper I got into the story, I began to notice little hints and motiffs (recurring themes). There was something going on between the lines in the writing...  Jason, your character, starts off as a frightened normal person who is horrified to have to kill someone. Once he gets better at it, and realizes how good he is at it, he starts to actually have fun. At one point, Jason has a conversation with one of the friends he had saved, and asks her what it felt like to win a race (shes a swimmer). He tells her at first killing was scary, but now it just 'feels like winning'. His friends start looking at him a little strangely as he becomes more and more ruthless, getting deeply involved with the natives who gradually tattoo his arm with tribal markings.   As you get further along, it becomes clear that you aren't the white man saving those silly brown savages, you're just being used. Jason, however, begins to see himself as the hero of the native people. Gradually, his motives shift from rescuing his friends to fighting this war.   At one point, he could escape with all his friends and go back to his old life, but chooses to stay on the island and continue fighting--and not for noble reasons.    This all mirrors your experience as the player (likely a young white male, statistically). As you have fun wiping out pirate camps in all sorts of creative ways, Jason's friends worry that he's starting to have fun killing people. The natives hailing you as their hero mirrors the typical game or hollywood movie story, when actually they're just using you, a gung-ho insane white person, as a tool in their civil war.  I can't possibly cover all the metaphors and comparisons, but here's some rapid-fire ones: Vaas is particularly interesting as a sort of mirror figure to Jason, or a glimpse at what Jason could become. The use of psychedelic drugs to help portray Jason getting deeper and deeper into the rabbit hole--oh and the use of Alice In Wonderland quotes. Jason's relationship with the beautiful native woman who loves him unconditionally because he's the best at killing, a gamer fantasy.  As the end of the story plays out, the metaphors gets more in-your-face. There's a choice you the player has to make at the very end. Stop reading here if you don't want it spoiled.    You're looking into the eyes and listening to the pleas of what seems like a real person, a young woman who loves you, a realistic, fleshed out character with flaws, feelings, and normal relationship problems. Then you have to choose: 1) Save your friends and go back to the real world, possibly with an imperfect, complicated, realistic relationship with your old girlfriend. or 2) Cut her throat while she begs and pleads, and join Citra, the beautiful, busty, half-naked woman who fell in love with how well you kill people and is entirely subservant to you, staying on the island as the best warrior.  No matter how many hundreds of pirates I had fun killing with machetes, rocket launchers, flying jeeps, and angry tigers, I would never click to cut her throat, not even just to see the other ending. It's one thing to play a typical shooter game, blasting faceless nameless enemies by the hundreds, or killing truly evil villains, but it's something else entirely to kill a helpless character that feels like a real person--and I think that was the point.

I recommend this game it looks beautiful and sounds amazing. ",

It's not very complicated, though compared to the typical first person shooter I guess it could be considered 'more complex.' I had gtx680s in SLI when I beat it and I maxxed the game out and enjoyed great framerates. If I'm going to play a 'game,' i.e. not a simulator, I had better enjoy the story or premise. I really was surprised by this one. I hated some characters in the game and loved some other characters. The choice at the end was interesting and I decided to make a save point and enjoy the fruits of both labors.   Graphics: Top notch. Sincerely. Very beautiful game. God rays, water, the flight graphics. Everything was fun to look at.  Gameplay: Also top notch. Everything you'd want from an arcade game. There's so much to do that is both story related and time wasting.   Controls: intuitive game, easy to program things the way you want them to be programmed. I would recommend this to anybody who likes arcade games.   Sound: everything was good here, good music in the vehicles, the actors were actually pretty cool. Some people didn't like the frattyboy main character but I could relate in some aspects.  ",

Despite these minor minuses, didnt mind at all since there's a lot of varieties in the island, from sneaking up on enemies to just opening fire on each base that you would need to capture.

If you always have internet, no worries, it's a thing that you sign up for once and then you see it for a few seconds when you start the game. Voice acting in general also falls here.  The bad: Directx11. Maybe it's personal, but I could not get a playable framerate with an nvidia gtx980. I run it fine at a solid 60 on directx9, and the only apparent difference are postfx. The story is pretty lame. Your character is meant to be relatable, but comes off whiny. Plot holes and cliches are plentiful.

Not so much the crafting part, but exploring the map to find the type of animals you need, killing and then skinning those animals. The map is also ♥♥♥♥ing fantastic in every way, and it is massive. Climbing up the towers to find certain areas never gets old and is so damn satisfying. Also, there is nothing like taking over a really hard base with only a bow and/or your knife and not getting seen once. This game is literally overflowing with content but it still somehow just works. Lots of people say the story is pretty lackluster. I sort of agree on the fact that it is kinda stupid, but it still kept me very drawn in. Lots of people complain about uplay. I think they they need to stop ♥♥♥♥♥ing to be honest. It isn't that bad. You can unlock dlc by getting achivements for ♥♥♥♥s sake. It is just a minor inconvenience and it isn't even that intrusive. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that the voice acting is aids. It sucks.

Enemies take sporadic damage, i know some enemies wear armor but when im shooting them in the head they should go down quite fast. Sniper rifles dont aways work, as in i shoot a guy and the bullet goes through the head but it doesn't always register. I was never a true farcry or crysis fan due to the limited control modifications available in the game, that and the fact that other things are buggy too. Vehicles are too light, some objects are unpassable when there is a wide gaping hole in the middle of them and enemy ai is sporadic and not in a wholly good way. Visually the game is great, and the story for the most part is pretty good. Other AAA games that have great mechanics, dont always have a good played out story but its ok here if you can get past the party boy who is like I've never shot a gun before or has never been in combat all of a sudden is a master of disaster and what not.",

            "review_text": "'Far Cry 3' is a very enjoyable open-world sandbox first-person shooter. Right off the bat, I was free to explore one of the two islands. I spent the first 16 hours of the game exploring, activating radio towers (the only time to date I actually enjoyed first-person platforming), hunting animals and relics, crafting bigger wallets and ammo bags, and -- the best part of the game -- liberating outposts. Given the dynamic game environment, each of my encounter or scenarios with enemies varied, and this made 'Far Cry 3' unpredictable and replayable.  It wasn't until my 24th hour that I moved on with the story missions, which feature exciting set pieces and action. Just when I thought I've got the rhythm of the game down, the game granted me access to the second island. This second island features a different terrain, providing new challenges in liberating outposts and making me rethink my tactics. It's also full of nooks and cranies and secrets waiting to be discovered, just like on the first island.  One of my very few gripes about 'Far Cry 3', however, was the boss battles. Like some of the contemporary action games I've played, boss battles were reduced to quick time events. This diminished the tension of the conflicts and made me feel more like an observer, resulting in rather unsatisfying gameplay. One particular boss battle was particularly disappointing because his character was already under developed; battling him by pressing a few buttons on cue made the experience even more underwhelming. This made me miss grand boss battles like those found in games like 'Crysis'  Despite my annoyance about boss battles, 'Far Cry 3' remained entertaining and fresh as I approached my 50th hour into the game. The game has surprisingly much to offer. 'Far Cry 3' gets a very enthusiastic thumbs-up from me.",

Far Cry 3 doesn't ever forget its roots in action and non-linearity the original and second were praised for, but it takes all the slow ♥♥♥ vehicle driving and repetitive gameplay of 2 and throws it into the pacific.  You can spend dozens of hours just exploring the Rakyat Islands and find cool stuff and doing side quests, hang glide across the ocean, or go knee deep into the storyline, which is what I suggest doing. Far Cry 3 does an excellent job of blending realistic and (occasionally) silly elements (you'll be fighting a human trafficking ring by...burning down their weed  production...yeah?)  but never feels forced or boring to play. gunplay is as fast and fluid as you want it to be, and the excellent branching skill tree system gives you multiple ways to play and approach the game. Everything oozes replayability and action in a well done package. My only real complaint is that the last 1/3 of the story doesn't feel like it transitioned smoothly. Vaas Montenegro is an expertly done villain (he's on the bloody game art for christ's sake) yet he's not even the main antagonist (some dutch a**hole named Hoyt is), and I don't really agree with it.  Despite the small flaws and the requirement to use Uplay (you will need to use it for this), the game is excellent and one I can heartily recommend. I hope someone makes a mod of this to turn the acid trip that is Far Cry 2 into something like this.",

            "review_text": "Farcry 3 is an open-world RPG shooter; and one of the best shooters I've played so far. This game inclines more to a shooter while attempting to balance it's RPG-play. The RPG aspect comes from the customisability of the player's loadout (weapon etc), allowing for the player to take on an objective with his most comfortable style. Although Farcry 3 has a skill tree or 'perk' tree that introduces more role-playing elements, the fact that every skill in there can be obtained diminishes the 'different player, different stats' element of a RPG. Hence, the game feels more inclined towards a First-person shooter. The unique thing about this game is the integration of animals into the gameplay. This gives the game a more realistic feel as animals are abound in the wild and they can come as a boon or a bane to anyone. Farcry 3 has effectively brought out this aspect by having animals roam the wild and aiding you while you set up a raid on an enemy camp or create confusion for the player while attempting to raid an enemy camp. Animals in captivity can be used to your advantage against its captors, or while sneaking up from the flanks of an enemy group/convoy/camp, a wild animal attacks you causing your plan to fail. The introduction of wildlife into game also allows for side 'quests' such as hunting and also crafting of personal equipment. This aspect gives the game a more varied feel as opposed to traditional FPS. On the topic of realism, as with many other games, the producers have created the protaganist (the player) as an android running on nuclear power. This could have been improved with the need for sleep (such as a timer which resets upon sleep or penalises players with reduced stats/abilities/actions); that, however, is my own take on how the game could have been made more realistic and may not suit all players out there. The graphics of the game is comparable to most FPS games out there on the market (2012). Although not top notch for the year, in my opinion, it is very good considering it is an open world game and has many aspects fused into its gameplay. The actions and shootouts of the game is highly non-linear due to its open world setting. It allows one to play a First-person shooter the likes of Modern Warfare/Black Ops without having a linear flow. This aspect, in my opinion, gives the player a more 'on-the-set' feel; where every action that the player makes, leads to something totally different in the reaction of the enemies. I personally went for the long range and stealthy approach, thinning the enemy ranks with hidden sniper fire and then going in 'Black Ops' style when the time is right. Other players can choose to go in loud, taking out groups of enemies with RPG or Grenades then finishing the rest with heavy fire. This myriad of interchangeable play style, which differs from player to player, is the game's main plus point - one which will make Farcry 3 suit the many gamers out there. In all, it is fair to say that this game is a strong contender for the title of FPS or Action/Adventure Game of the Year. It has a heavy FPS aspect while giving the player a role-playing 'feel'. It is definitely a must-try game for those die-hard FPS fans who want to experience something different from the linear FPS games. - 9.1/10",

Combat is fun, exploration is great. crafting system rewards you with better equipments with bigger capacity for your items and arsenals. The game is without any downfall though. Story is not necessarily original by any means. Most of the characters are pretty flat that I was not able to invest on any of them (minus Vaas.) Especially, the protagonist is a whiny ♥♥♥♥♥. Also, this game will require some true master race tier PC spec to run smoothly. It's like running Crysis all over again with mid-range computer in 2007. Co-ops are pretty entertaining and so is a bit grindy multiplayer.(It does encourage sticking together as a team though.)  Despite a few drawbacks the game possesses. I can still say that the game does many things tastefully. I can say this is my GOTY of 2012.  8.7/10",

There is also a lack of choises as you progress through the plot, which is something else we're used to with Mass Effect and Skyrim. At times it felt like I was being dragged through the story rather than watching it.  The biggest problem though is Uplay, you have to sign up with it to play and if you're not online you get a lot of nag screens asking you to connect. You would have thought Steam provided all the DRM the game needed without having to deal with Uplay as well.

This time i jumped strait into story mode and I finished the game in a few days of play ( like 8 hour days :P) And i have to say i was in love, the story and how it was put together was amazing, there was even parts that gave me gooses bumps and even made me shed a tear, even the end!  The Graphics are good but i really think they can be improved on, but im sure ill find out they have been in Farcry 4.  A few things that really annoyed me was the radio towers, and the steps leading up to them or any stairs in the game tbh, i would always get stuck at the bottom and have to jump up, might be to high of the ground or something but thats my main issue on this game.  Keep up the good work and I really cant wait to get myself a copy of Farcry 4 and do a youtube review on the game, if its as good as this ill be a happy man :)",

No major graphical problems at all that I saw throughout the entire game, however some very minor clipping occured in the background of some of the cinematics. Other than that, every cutscene is filled with vivid colour and amazing views of the land.  Gamepaly wise.. Where to begin? This game gives you the ability to conquer camps and missions how YOU want to do it. Go in guns blazing or be a silent assassin, performing incredible takedowns on entire encampments of enemy pirates. An awesome exp. and ranking system that lets you pick from a tree of upgrades that is filled with helpful benefits lets you build your character stronger and more lethal as you progress through the game. Craftable items requiring materials gathered from skinning the wild animals you find in the jungles or plants that you cut down let you grow your arsenal of items bigger and better, very similar to the way you grow the physical abilities of your character as the story progresses, and all this is done at an achievable yet challenging pace. You're constantly able to upgrade your character and his items as you go through the game.  Personally, I was never left bored in this game. Between the hunting tasks, the infiltration of the pirate encampments, and the main story missions, there was always gripping content to play through and it left me with feeling of satisfaction everytime I completed any of the tasks. Like I've said before, this game has a way of being the perfect balance of fun and challenging.   Don't know how else to put it: This game is absolutely incredible, and you cannot possibly go wrong adding it to your library. 10/10",

Each time you climb a tower you unlock the map of the surrounding area and get some free weapons and such. So, what is it about the towers that makes FC3 such a joy? Although identical in structure, each tower has been damaged to some degree, making each tower a unique mini puzzle, figuring out where you have to jump and climb to get to the top. It would have been so simple to make each climb identical, just a simple cookie-cutter pattern, and 99 games out of 100 would have done just that. FC3 went that extra mile, put in that added touch. That's what makes this such a great game. They thought about it, thought about what we'd like, what they'd like as gamers, and implemented it.

However to keep it relative to the steam community, if you do not own a DESKTOP PC and only a LAPTOP/NOTEBOOK PC then do not purchase this version of the game. The PC port of this game does not support mobile versions of GPU chipsets. I have $4800 Alienware m18xR2 with two nVidia GTX 675 in SLI, and I cannot even run the start menue. Steam will not give a refund for this type of thing either. Lucky i am in the process of building a Desktop, but in the mean time, I got a great deal on the price. Its a shame the devs didnt bother with total optimization.",

            "review_text": "Far Cry 3 is a messy game. It has highs and lows.   The best part of the game is when it lets you play. The hunting, bounty hunting, and post liberating missions are rewarding and exciting, even for the second or third playthrough. The rakyat challenges are great fun too!  Exploration elements, like collecting boxes and statues are okay, if you are into that thing, but they feel rather useless timewasters, every cave looks the same, there are no real hidden beauties worth exploring for, and the boxes usually contain pocketmoney you won't need anyway.  The main mission line is great, until the second act starts, and until its your first go. The unskippable cutscenes are extremely frustrating, and the second half (or rather, quarter?) feels lazy. The story serves the game to a degree, but you have to let logic go. Its a drug filled powerfantasy after all, nothing is really true, is it?  The gunplay is solid, leveling up Brody feels rewarding, you really feel progress and some skills elevate the gameplay for sure. Crafting is mediocre at best, its really just a grind, but at least it gives you reason to hunt.   The great thing is that the game opens up relatively quickly (after ~15 mins of forced hand holding), and you can pretty much unlock all the crafted items, except some special ones, and level up the character fairly, except some things which are gated with story related missions.  Being said that, the game is full of performance issues, and most of them are only occuring in this retail version. First of all, the double DRM is a joke. It has no use, since the multiplayer is _unplayable_. I couldn't find a simple PvP match, there were simply not enough people playing the game, and Co-op is unplayable too, its riddled with game breaking bugs, and very common lag spikes.  So, buying the game solely for the purpose of testing multiplayer options was a bad choice for me. But little did I know, that I won't be able to enjoy the game on higher graphics settings neither. The single player part outright crashes whenever I turn textures higher than the lowest setting.   This is an issue for many, and it occurs on every driver version and both on ATI and NVIDIA cards. Some wrote it happens only in the opening cutscene, for me it kills the game whenever I want to use the camera. It might be some texture streaming issue on the camera and the phone in the opening cutscene.  Second thing is that the game performance slopes down, after 10-20 minutes of gameplay, the framerate sinks and stays low for no apparent reason.  The thing is, that the &gt;cracked&lt; version of the game has none of these issues, even on highest DX9 settings. Oh sure, there is no multiplayer, but thats _not even working in the retail version neither_.  Summary: - great visuals (if your version lets you use them) - solid gunplay - passable single player story missions - great side missions  - game breaking bugs - multiplayer is not working - stupid, useless Uplay integration",

            "review_text": "The best way I can sum up Far Cry 3 is Skyrim, but with guns. Well okay, it's not quite as deep, with only a basic crafting system and a single layer of plot, but what Far Cry lacks in depth it makes up more than enough with its fast action, dynamic missions, and luscious graphics.  Set on a chain of islands in somewhere in the south Pacific ocean, Far Cry places you in the shoes of a thrill-seeking vacationer who must rise to the challenge of rescuing his friends and overcoming the local drug smugglers embedded in the area. You've got an ever-growing arsenal of weapons, whatever vehicle you can jump inside of, and a variety of items to upgrade as you wage war across the islands. The views are beautiful and the locals (and wildlife) are deadly.  The sense of scale in Far Cry 3 is incredible. Virtually every part of the landscape you can see -and there's a lot of it - is somewhere you can go. Cars, boats, hangliders and more are scattered throughout, and there are pockets of enemies and roaming packs of animals waiting for you everywhere.  The real targets, aside from the game's primary mission, are the small bases where enemies conduct business, and each is different in its design and position in the landscape. You can run in guns blazing or sneak through, sabotaging traps and disabling enemies one at a time - it's up to you.  I enjoyed the story of Far Cry 3, which is slightly predictable, but still has its share of twists. My favorite part of the game was exploring the islands and taking out the enemy bases.  Normally with this type of game, I get tired of the tedium and eventually quit, but this wasn't the case with Far Cry 3 - I stuck it out and finished it, and was sad when it was over. With a ton of hidden locations and hard-to-find collectibles though, it's easy to find more to do.  My only complaint about Far Cry 3 is that it requires uPlay to be installed and started up when launched. I'd prefer that games I buy through Steam only have one launcher. But that's just me.",

While skydiving, they land on an archipelago named the Rook Islands, controlled by pirates under the control of Vaas. Grant and Jason are held and taunted by Vaas while the others are taken to be held for ransom. Grant engineers their escape but is killed by Vaas, and Jason manages to scramble away. He is met by Dennis Rogers, a native of island working with the Rakyat tribe to seize control back from the pirates. Dennis sees the potential in Jason to follow the Rakyat 'path of the warrior' in rescuing his friends, and gives him a tatau that gives Jason the strength and knowledge to defeat the pirates. With Dennis's help, Jason locates Daisy and takes her to the house of Dr. Earnhardt, who offers to shelter Jason's other friends from Vaas. Dennis introduces Jason to Citra, the leader of the Rakyat and Vaas' sister, who tells Jason she will offer her help if he can retrieve the Silver Dragon, a ceremonial knife revered by the Rakyat. Jason experiences a drug-induced vision given to him by Citra to identity Willis Huntley, a CIA agent operating on the island with information on both his friends and the knife. Willis has been monitoring Hoyt Volker, a deranged South African slave trader who Vaas has been working with, selling those he captures into human slavery even after the ransoms have been paid, and who is also engaged in drug trafficking from the island. Keith has already been sold to Bambi 'Buck' Hughes, who offers to give Keith back to Jason in exchange for finding the Silver Dragon, buried in ancient Chinese temples on the island. Jason eventually finds the knife, but when Buck reneges on the deal, Jason kills him with it. Jason brings Liza, Keith and Oliver to Dr. Earnheart's, where they find a boat needing minor repairs to be able to escape the island. When Keith reveals that he saw Riley shot and killed, the others try to convince Jason to leave with them, but Jason, now set on the path of the warrior, vows revenge on Vaas and Hoyt, worrying Liza. Jason brings the knife to Citra, and he is revered as a hero of the Rakyat. With her help, Jason infiltrates Vaas' compound and kills him. Willis, who has been given orders to leave the island, provides Jason with transport to Hoyt's island and information on Sam Becker, another CIA operative that has gained the trust of Hoyt and is working deep undercover in Hoyt's army of privateers. Sam helps Jason to similarly gain Hoyt's trust by identifying a potential assassination attempt on Hoyt by the remnants of Vaas' pirates. Hoyt offers Jason the ability to interrogate a prisoner which turns out to be Riley. Jason, with Sam's help, is able to discrete reveal himself while still feigning his support for Hoyt by beating up Riley to get his name. Hoyt is pleased with the results, and offers Jason and Sam to a come to a private poker game. Jason and Sam arrange to kill Hoyt and rescue Riley at the game, but first assure that Hoyt's men cannot respond quickly enough by destroying their fuel depot and communication network. At the game, Hoyt suddenly kills Sam and slices off Jason's finger, having figured out the deception, but Jason gains the advantage and kills Hoyt in a knife fight. Hoyt's dying words reveal that Riley is about to be flown off the island, and Jason races to stop this. He frees Riley, and Riley takes control of one of Hoyt's helicopters to make their escape. They return to Dr. Earnheart's, finding the building aflame and the man dying after an attack by the Rakyat, who took their friends. They fly to the Citra's temple, where Cirta forces Jason of making a choice to complete his path of the warrior by killing his friends and allowing her to be his mate, or to abandon it by letting them go and return to the life he knew. The player's decision affects the game's outcome. If the player should opt to complete the path, Jason kills his friends to Citra's praise, and then he and Citra copulate; after this, Citra then kills Jason, and as he dies, she tells him that he died like that of a warrior, assuring that his child she now carries will become the new Rakyat leader. If the player opts to save the friends, Dennis is outraged that Jason refused to accept Citra's love, and rushes to stab him, but Citra moves in the way and takes the blade herself. As Jason and his friends flee the template, Dennis is remorseful at having killed Citra. The friends are then seen leaving the island on the boat, with a voiceover by Jason knowing that it will be impossible to fully recover from his ordeal.  GAMEPLAY: Far Cry 3 is a first-person shooter, which also features role-playing game elements including experience points, skill trees, and a crafting system. The player has the ability to take cover behind objects to break enemies' lines of sight and to peek around and over cover and blindfire. The player has the ability to perform silent takedowns by performing melee attacks from above, below, or close behind. The game's narrative director, Jason Vandenberghe, said that the story mode map is around ten times larger than the game's previous installments. Players are given the ability to survey and plan out their attacks with stealth takedown combinations and tag enemies with the camera in order to track their movement once they break the player's line of sight.[8] Equipment is controlled by a simple system. As missions are completed, new items are unlocked to be purchased or crafted by Jason, using the pelts of various animals found around the island to improve items-, weapons- and ammunitions-carrying capabilities. When scramblers on radio towers are removed, areas of the map are opened and weapons in the shop are first made available for buying, and ultimately made free. Apart from the basic model of each category which can be picked up from slain enemies or at the start of several missions, most weapons can be upgraded with one or more additions : silencers, larger magazines, better sights are the most common improvements. A special group of weapons (one per category), unlocked depending on achievements, possess maxed out category statistics and/or unique abilities. All weapons are based off existing weapons, using most or all of their official designation, and comes with a description describing their main advantages and inconveniences. Weapon comparison can be made depending on 5 statistics : accuracy, damage (per round), range, rate of fire, and mobility (the better the mobility, the faster the character can move while firing). Apart from guns, the player also has access to a few unique weapons or tools. Ammunitions for each weapon category can be picked up or, in the case of arrows, retrieved after use. Reloading and magazine swap speeds vary from weapon to weapon. Reloading takes place automatically when the weapon runs empty, or can be triggered manually. For the bow, arrow nocking and pulling takes time before shooting, and conditions the arrow's arch, precision and power : the longer, the better. Area effect arrows can eventually be crafted. As outposts of Vaas' pirate group are attacked and retaken, the vicinity around the outpost becomes safer, it unlocks new side quests for that area, involving missions like hunting the many different wildlife species on the island to upgrade ones equipment.[9] Skills are collected by gaining experience from completing missions and killing enemies, and are unlocked in three skill trees, which correspond to the Spider, the Heron, and the Shark. Each skill tree upgrades different aspects of Jason's abilities, with the Spider upgrading his stealth takedowns and hunting skills, Shark for assault takedowns and health, with the Heron upgrading his long-range takedowns and mobility.

            "review_text": "When I first heard about this game the initial one-liner stood out - Skyrim with guns. It seemed like every semi-sandboxy FPS game was being hailed as that. Yet, over time it really is quite true. The amount of exploration and depth is quite amazing. The storyline is quite good as well. But that's just my initial, 200 character or less impression.  Mechanics: The mechanics are prett smooth. The UI, as well as the gun UI and the menu system is quite fluid and can be mastered fairly easily. One issue I have with the gun UI is that there are 8 different options and it's easy to select the wrong item/weapon. What's worse is that your switch weapon key, or 'Y' if you use a 360 controller, only switches out between the last 2 weapons. So if you selected C4 on accident then you now have a sniper rifle then C4. Frustrating during hectic moments. Yet, when discussing with friends, by the time you unlock the extra holsters (gun slots) you should've, at least theoretically, mastered the UI. The driving is pretty good, you can certainly tell the difference between each of the vehicles you drive - be prepared to just run past a couple of them saying 'f that noise'. The wingsuit and paragliding? Once you get the mechanics down, awesome fun.  Graphics/Audio: Great! I'm rocking an AMD setup with a 9790 3gb. No hiccups whatsoever. I do have a buddy that has an 7850 1gb, and there's some hiccups when there's some battles going down in open terrain. The view distance + explosions + everything else does tend to drop the framerate below 15 at times. (running a 1080p) Still, it's a visually stunning game with some very good charatcer portrails. THe audio is fantastic - great ambiance from wildlife roaming around to the creaking of radio towers as you climb.  Story: Excellent. Very well-written. It can draw out at times, while at others tend to leave you wanting a little more. However, the storyline is so convoluted that if you put it down for a month, you'd have forgotten what's happening in the Far Cry Universe.   Multiplayer/Co-op: Multiplayer is pretty standard, but nothing to write home about. It's certainly not it's selling point. The co-op is quite fun, but not really a lasting appeal. I play a lot of BF4 so just a disclaimer, I have some pretty big FPS bias - good and bad.  Overall: I give this game a 9/10. It's solid FPS with a great sandbox feel. The storyline is pretty linear, but not so much that you have to feel like you're screwing things up by adventuring around hunting Vaas' &amp; Hoyt's men or just going big game hunting in the caves. For completionist, you'll get 75+ hours out of the game. Fantastic dollar per hour value. I highly recommend it.",

You can jump off of a cliff, glide over an enemy base with your wingsuit, and drop a hundred feet onto a bomb-suited machinegun-wielding badass and break your fall perfectly by running him through the skull with your machete. You can silently pick off enemies from a hundred yards away with your silent rifle, watching with maddened glee as your enemies scramble in all the wrong directions, looking for their hunter like confused prey. You can unleash mountains of lead into legions of enemies with your fully automatic tiger-striped death-dealing bullet hose, laughing with derision as you swallow up enemy bullets with every health syringe you inject. You can destroy a helicopter with a flare gun. It is truly a thing of beauty.  The narrative of the campaign is weak and the characters are even weaker. The campaign will be hit or miss for most people, the individual missions even more so, but outside of the main story you have ultimate freedom to rule this island, YOUR island, however you choose to do so.  Sadly, one of the greatest faults is that the progression of the game is directly linked to the lackluster campaign. Many skills and even an entire southern island will be locked until you trudge through many of the game's missions.  The game has amazing longetivity and replay value. Beating the game allows you to reset all enemies on the world map whenever you choose, allowing you to reconquer the island ad infiniatum with all your unlocked skills, perks, and weapons. Difficulty can be swapped at any time, and the surprisingly solid Co-Op and Multiplayer ensure that you get the most out of your purchase. I love this game, and I would easily recommend it to anyone.  A Fair Warning: The game does use the Steam Portal version of Uplay to launch and requires a validation code to unlock online and multiplayer components. The game can be played in offline mode, but you will be locked out of achievements and player rewards if you do so.",

But I was already very close to the end when this review was released.  were they drunk while optimizing this game i mean jesus christ  That aside, it's a fantastic game, all things considered. The gunplay is top-notch (ironsights, auto-aim if you need it, hit detection actually works for the most part, etc), the story is mature, often dark/intense, and thought-provoking, and despite all the f-bombs and vulgar humor, the writing is surprisingly poignant and well-done in many instances, with even a few movie references slipped in for good measure.   Vaas and Hoyt are two of the most interesting villains in shooter history, imo; seriously, I instantly fell in love with both of them, they're very well done characters. The stealth is also quite good and there's skill points/outposts/crafting to check out if you're bored, which greatly amplifies the replay value. The game, for the most part, largely remains the same throughout, but there's plenty of shaking-up done regardless so it never really gets boring.   Overall, I'd definitely say to get this game; it's one of the best shooters I've played in years and I genuinely feel that it's a worthy addition to your Steam library.  oh and latino skillrex plays when you burn down the crops; that's both horrible and hilarious at the same time  FINAL NOTE: As stated above, the game is EXTREMELY poorly optimized, so you'll have to do a good deal of patching and configing if you have a mid-lowish level comp like me and want it to run at a decent fps.

        {
            "review_text": "A Study in Missed Opportunity, Plagued By Bizarre Design Choices  First, let me start out by saying that FarCry 3 is a fun game. It's a very cool, original concept that's well-implemented, and right from the very first scene, it's filled with heart-pounding action that does a very good job of making you feel like a normal guy thrown into an extraordinary situation. It's a sandbox-style game, with an absolutely enormous map that's gorgeously rendered, thoughtfully designed, and a lot of fun to explore.  But there are a few design choices that are just absolutely baffling, and really inexcusable in a PC game from a major, experienced developer that's been around for well over a decade.  For example, there is only one volume slider in the audio menu. You can turn the music on or off, and subtitles on or off, that's it. Why!? In every game I ever play, I adjust dialog volumes up a little, and sound effects and music down a bit (actually this is default in most games), so I can clearly hear the dialog. This isn't a 'cheat', it just makes it so I can hear what's being said no matter what else is going on. In Far Cry 3 on the other hand, there have been times when an important phone conversation has been completely drowned out by a combination of music and a thunderstorm. Just bizarre.  Also for some reason, you can't use both mouse and keyboard, and controller, at the same time. Enabling one completely disables the other. The controller setup is reasonably well-implemented, but there are times I really wish I could use the mouse to aim for more precision.  A smaller gripe is that if you alt-tab out of this game, it reverts to Windowed mode, so each time you do so, you have to go back into the menus and turn it back to full-screen. This by itself wouldn't be a bizarre choice, except that if you're playing on controller (which you pretty much have to -- vehicles are completely uncontrollable by keyboard), your mouse is still disabled any time it goes over the game screen (which by default fills the entire window).  Now, let's talk about missed opportunities...  This is a sandbox shooter with as much land mass area as any Bethesda game, and with a story that's deep enough to make it compare favorably with RPGs, despite the fact that the player doesn't really have any choices other than when to advance the main plot. Because of its depth, and the level of immersion it almost manages to achieve, I can't help but wonder why certain features weren't implemented, even optionally, that would complete the immersion.  For example, throughout the game, you hunt and kill an amazing variety of wildlife, all of which is very well implemented, with a living biome that feels very real. Tigers hunt prey animals, prey animals run from predators, and the resulting chases soon blend the spawns into a very pleasingly realistic and diverse biosphere. There are camps dotting the islands, with campfires in most of them and beds in all of them. There is already a crafting system built into the game. It's the -perfect- opportunity to introduce basic survival simulation, like hunger and thirst and the need for sleep.  It would make hunting an even more central part of the game, as you'd have to hunt to survive. It would also be more pleasing to me, to actually utilize the animals I kill. Instead, just like the rich prick the main character started out as, he kills them for their skins, to craft pouches and slings and holsters, nothing more. Why would they not also have him take the meat? They even have stores all over the islands with signs begging for meat, offering money for meat, even listing prices paid for various types of game animals. Even if they couldn't afford the extra development costs to implement a basic needs system like in Fallout: New Vegas, it would have taken almost no extra effort to just add the animal's meat to your rucksack in addition to its skin, so you could at least sell it for other people to eat, instead of slaughtering every animal you see just for its fur in a morally troublesome manner.  Also, there was a great opportunity for character development, that I feel was almost entirely missed. Jason Brody starts out as a whiny, entitled, self-important little brat, living off of daddy's money as he vacations in an exotic locale with his friends. After weeks basically alone, fending for himself in a dangerous tropical archipelago, hunting down pirates, learning advanced combat and stealth techniques and guerilla tactics, and getting himself entangled in a complex struggle between pirates and the native Rakyat tribe, the Jason Brody I play most of the time is a badass. He's self-sufficient, he shows no fear, he carefully crafts battle plans to take out entire outposts of well-armed enemies without even being detected. If he is detected, he keeps his cool and uses hit and run tactics to whittle the enemy forces down one man at a time, until he's victorious. He's like a Navy SEAL on crack.  And then he speaks....  And he's the sams god-forsaken whiny little self-entitled brat, making the same completely idiotic choices time after time after time... (how many times does he have to shout at the top of his lungs while sneaking into an enemy stronghold, so his friends, after week of captivity, won't have to go twenty more seconds without realizing they're being rescued, before he realizes that's NOT A GOOD IDEA!?) In short, the silent killer I play 95% of the time has developed from a kid who barely knows which end of the gun to point at the enemy to a total badass. They do a -great- job of communicating his inexperience and helplessness at the start of the game, and the progression from that to uber-badass feels smooth and intuitive. But the character the developers wrote and voice-acted remains unchanged, completely static and basically unaffected and unenlightened by his experiences as a guerilla warrior.  There are other issues with this game, a huge number if missed opportunities, and a lot of points where it's clear there just is a lack of attention to detail (one skill for example, lets you move at full speed while crouched. Your perspective and your held weapon jostle and move rapidly, as if you're doing just what the skill says: Jungle Run. But they forgot to change the foley! Your footsteps remain the same slow, measured pace they always were when sneaking. I mean... was someone in the audio department asleep that day?)  All of that being said, if you're willing to put up with a lot of annoyances, it's still a fun game, and worth playing. I wouldn't have taken the time to write this, and I wouldn't be so disappointed in its shortcomings, if there weren't a fantastic game lurking behind its issues. In the end analysis, I do recommend this game, but cautiously. If you're a member of its target audience, grab it if you already haven't. If you're the kind of gamer who plays Hardcore New Vegas on the other hand, a roleplayer looking for true, total immersion? It could do a lot better.  And seriously Ubisoft... the gaming industry in general figured out that more player choice in terms of volume controls and control configurations is better in like... 1993.

Enjoy skydiving, hunting, swimming, exploring, and being kidnapped by a slave trader and his band of pirates.  FarCry 3 was an amazing open-world FPS that kept you playing to learn the outcome of Jason Brody and his friends and family. The scenery gives you the sense of a tropical island paradise where you can just lay back and forget everything, but the pirates chasing after you and the inner conflict brings you back and shows you the real story of the island.  The story kept you hanging on and eventually letting you determine the fate of you and your friends. The drug trips remind me of Fallout 3's Point Lookout DLC, hallucinations and drug use is all a part of living on the island. And at points, the ending to the hallucinations left you wondering what really went on. It adds to an already amazing story. And in the end, you get to decide what happens. Not to Vass or Hoyt, but to your friends and yourself.  Combat is seamless and taking cover is as easy as crouching, using the aim button to lean over cover. I had played Deus Ex: Human Revolution right before I picked this game up, and unlike Deus Ex, enemies are not impossible to kill, with just a few bullets to the chest. Flame adds a whole other aspect of gunplay. Burning shrubery, grass, and trees can siphon enemies out of hiding spots, as well as block off escape routes.  As I had just finished Deus Ex, I was still in a cautious stealth gameplay mode, and Far Cry 3 did a good job at the aspect as well. By the end of teh game you're able to take out an entire outpost in just a few seconds all the while staying in stealth. Throwing knives from one enemy unit to the other or taking the pistol off of one person and using it to take out the rest of the outpost. Even taking enemies out from above or below silently, adds to the stealth aspect of the game. It's not the most perfected stealth, but it works for the game's purposes.  I didn't really find too many cons to the game. No game-breaking bugs or easily looked over mistakes. I outright had a great time playing this game and nothing broke it. But, there's always people who will have a different opinion.",

And archery, but with like, explosive and fire arrows. Its just fun, really.

Now that's for the price, about the actuall game I have to say this: Really nice gameplay, feels realistic, top graphics, runs very smoothly maxed out (EVGA GTX 770 ACX SC, Intel core i5-4670K 3.40GHz), all maps are very well made (singleplayer, co-op...) which shows here: I once drove into a hole while being chased and I thought I was done for as I couldn't get out and I ran out of ammo. But than I swam underwater (there was a pit) and I found an underground cave that lead me straight through a hill and I came out on a road. The AI doesn't seem to have any major problems, but it sometimes acts silly. exp.: Two enemies saw me, but they were on the other side of the river (it was like 4-5 meters wide) so they kept shouthing at me things like: 'I'll get you!', 'I see you!' and stuff, but didn't fire any shots. I don't think I was out of their range, couse there was like 8-10 meters beetween us. It's also very well voice acted and I LOVE the way driving feels. Also very rich map with many little secrets, hunting areas and side-missions. So my final verdict on Far Cry 3 is 9/10, a great game.

            "review_text": " Story  In Far Cry 3 you play as Jason Brody, a kind of a spoiled brat who, along with his friends are vacationning on Rook islands somewhere in the Pacific. Things take a turn for the worst when the whole gang is kidnaped by pirates and are held as ransom. You manage to escape, and from there the adventure will include tattoos, hunting, saving your friends, reconquering the island from the pirates and ascend the ranks of the local Maori tribe.  The story is paper thin. FC3 doesn't make the case for first person narratives. After countless pirate kills Brody was still disgusted by skinning an animal or felt horrified by something he kinda did dozens of times before. This wasn't enough to disconnect from the game but it definitely was enough to establish a distance and render to nil any emotionnal involvement.  On the flip side though, the game introduce Vaas, the main antagonist, and he is awesomely written and acted. I would've loved to see him fully developped but alas it wasn't the case. Boy, talk about missed opportunity.   Gameplay  -FC3 has RPG elements, you gain experience from completing main and secondary missions, liberating outposts, finding lost artifacts and so on. The skill tree is divided into three categories that improves hunting, combat, health and survival.  -You have various vehicule at your disposal to get you around. They all handle pretty much the same way except for land vehicules which had a rough edge I liked. Being Far Cry you can also hop onto a glider and there are also ziplines that brings speed to the gameplay.  -I found the main missions to be a lot of fun, they are intense and varied. The same can't be said for optionnal ones. Ranging from menial to plain dull, ythey can all be skipped without generating any meaningful impact on your playthrough. -There are also diversions such as races, hunting and assassination, but they are not that thrilling at all.  -In order to get around you have to be able to see the map and you can do so by activating radio towers scattered across the map. Once you do, a portion of the map will be visible and unlock more missions and diversions. The pirates have many outpost and liberating them will lessened their foothold and open the territory to friendlies and civilian alike.   Combat  Combat is fast and fun. You have many type of weapons available, each containing several weapons. There are also unique weapons that can be earned by completing missions, discovering items or simply advancing through the game.  Though not explicitely said stealth play is THE way to go. For instance liberating an outpost undetected grants you three times the experience points and takedowns are part of the core mechanics of the game.  Takedown are quasi quick time events that lets you insta-kill an enemy. Simply approach one undetected, push the prompt button and watch. The basic takedown is a stab but skill points can let you buy several other type of takedowns such as from below, from above and the ability to chain them.  The basic takedown is savage and thrilling and offer an additionnal strategic option to combat, but I can't help but feeling that this mechanic would've been right at home in a 3rd person action game but feels clunky in a FPS. Returning from FC2, wildfire play an important part in the game. It can cutoff enemies, set them on fire but can turn on you in a pinch.   Wildlife and crafting  Wild and plant life plays a HUGE role in FC3, you can hunt the former and gather the latter. Upon progressing in the game you will unlock recipes. They can be crafted with the proper amount of plant samples and will grant you temporary effects.  You can also hunt the wildlife to gather their hide. These will upgrade your equipment so that you can carry more weapons and ammo and a bigger inventory. Wildlife is quite diverse as there are boars, antilopes, tigers and pack of wild dogs just to name a few.  If there is one aspect the Ubisoft nailed it is this one. Not only does wildlife adds realism to the setting but also makes it completely alive and unpredictable. One of the nicest moments in my playthrough was when I was slowly approaching an outpost, then in walks a tiger who proceded to maul all pirates in the camp and liberating it in the process!    Difficulty, money and others  Here comes the negative stuff. Actually it can all be summed up in two words : hand holding.  I set my game to hard expecting a challenge. The hard setting in FC3 is the equivalent of easy or normal in most other games, depending on how hardcore of a gamer you are. Let me put it this way, my health is gone and getting another bullet doesn't kill me.  Next there is money. Very soon in the game you will be chin-deep in money, it is everywhere. Most actions that you do lets you earn money on top of finding it all over the place. If a torrent of money wasn't enough as you activate radio towers the merchants will give you their weapons for free! Needless to say that the economy in FC3 is quite underwhelming.  I mentionned loot, but there is no item system in FC3, the myriad of items found totally meaningless except to be sold in the store. Too bad as it could have become the basis for some barter system that would have been interesting.  Hunting and crafting is amazing but by the 1/5 of my playthrough I had all the upgrades I could have and there is no other incentive for hunting except maybe to sell hides. As for crafting, well, you can't walk ten steps without stumbling on a plant. They appear on the minimap and shimmer in your field of view, just in case you missed it.  Here you are, in this big sandbox game and exploration is neither encouraged nor rewarded. Looking for a tiger skin? No problem, just open the map and find the area with a big fat tiger stencil on it, then travel to that area and you will find one in no time. Looking for a plant to craft a syringe? Just walk in a straight line and you will find one eventually. There are over a dozen recipes that can be made but only three are helpful and the others are completely useless. Why would I need a syringe that would let me soak damage when the game encourages me to play stealthy?  There are also loot and collectibles, namely statues and letters. All of them appear on the minimap when you get in their vicinity but you can also buy maps that will reveal their locations. Aside from the achievementsthere is no incentive to collect any of them as they will only give you more money. Let's not talk about loot crates, they are countless, and only serves to give even  MORE  money!  Last but not least, FC3 works with a checkpoint system. There is actually 1, yes only 1, save slot, and saving will only save your progress. If you quit and restart the game you will spawn next to the closest radio tower or outpost from your save point. If you want to reload your game try a different strategy be ready to make your way back first. In this day and age this kind of save system is inexcusable.   Pros  : -Wildlife dynamic is so well done that it raises industry standard -Pleasing visuals -Main missions are a blast -A good chunk of achievements feels like achievements   Cons  : -Open world game that doesn't encourage or reward exploration -In-game economy is a joke -Not very challenging -Bland story and dialogue   Final verdict  :  Although I may have seemed harsh I did have a lot of fun playing FC3. Unfortunately the triple-AAA-dification of the franchise is not for the best. The checklist of features might look good on the back of the box but once you scratch the surface their isn't much to be found.  I am actually excited by Ubisoft's upcoming Watchdogs and the almost confirmed FC4, I am anxious to take the journey into their wide open worlds, I just wish they would let go of my hand.   7/10    ",

I'd bought FarCry when it first came out, and played it to completion. I loved the gameplay and the story, and thought it something really special. Then, when I heard of FarCry 2, I rushed out to relive that same magic, but alas, FarCry 2 was nowhere near as 'fun' to play. Granted, it had nice visuals, handled well, but the constant re-spawning check-points and the whole Malaria storyline got really frustrating. I remember, in fact, giving up about half way through - still not having completed it to this day.   Then, I heard about FarCry 3. Again, it seemed to be a story set on an island, open world, with milita style check points, so I was caught in a quandry - would FarCry 3 be like FarCry 2, or would it actually be fun to play? Well, I'm pleased to admit that I took a chance and bought FarCry 3 - and I'm pleased I did.  I was gripped, from the opening cinematic scenes to the end credits, by the compelling story line and excellent handling. Not only that, but having taken over 45 hours to complete the game, I consider FarCry 3 a perfect example of how fun PC gaming can be. The characters have depth, the voice acting is superb, and the story has a plot that makes many a Hollywood movie seem shallow by comparison. Sure, there may be some (very few) linear moments, but that's coupled with a genuinely 'open world' experience, sub-missions, crafting of kit from scavenged items etc. The choice between a stealth kill and the 'all out guns blazing' approach differs in result and reward, and both can be used on every mission.  In closing, I have to admit that it's not often I actually sit and read the end credits of a game, but this one was worthy of my time and attention. It's been a long time since I enjoyed a game this much, and I sincerely look forward to FarCry 4 - Let's hope they build on the sucess of this game, and not fall back on their laurels.",

I was not aware of this until I purchased regretably but do be aware of this.

The story is rather well set up and the protagonist is surprisingly well developed but I feel that the game takes itself too seriously at times. In addition, for all the hype they build up for the antagonists I was rather dissapointed with the strange way the game dealt with them in their respective climaxes. Would it have been too hard to have at least a shootout or a chase sequence, something that tests the skills you actually apply in gameplay as opposed to a scripted quick time event knife fight boss fight that comes out of left field? Those are just some gripes but overall I'd say the game is a solid enough experience to be worth buying if you don't mind these minor annoyances.",

Yes. Pros: - Beautiful graphics (even though it's a few years old) - Amazing storyline - you are kidnapped by a psychopatic pirate called Vaas while on a holiday with your two brothers and friends. You then set out to find them and save them using the jungle and cool weapons to help you.  - Weapons - yep, this game might not have such an extensive arsenal of things such as GTA V, but there is enough to keep you happy (especially the special ones such as flamethrowers, and RPG's). - Free Roam/Open World This is one of the best open world games ever. Minimal amounts of people. Lots of nature and wildlife to explore. This makes Far Cry 3 one of the best games ever to just explore.   Cons: Even though this game is simply brilliant, there are still some drawbacks.  - This game does require a good GPU to run it. You will need at least a £130 GPU to play on medium/low settings. So far though with my GTX 770 I have not noticed any frame drops. - Controls This game is best enjoyed with a gamepad which means either getting used to the keyboard or buying a cheap one from ebay or your local dodgy shop. Luckily I have a gamepad.  Also, sometimes you will not know which control is which since this is different than a standard FPS.   And that's about it for the cons. All in all, if you bought this at the sales for peanuts, don't be disappointed because this game is truly fantastic - and even if you didn't, it's still worth the £15 price tag. So I hoped this helped :) P.S I have played this game before, so don't question me playing only 2hrs of it here.",

Stealth encounters are great, any chance I could I would try and act like it was a first-person Metal Gear Solid and take everyone out quietly. One thing that annoyed me however was that even though if you had a gun with a silencer, if you shoot an enemy, even if no one can see him, they all automatically get alerted and start searching, as opposed to killing with a takedown which is completely silent though the victim lets out a stifled yell. However, despite these elements, it really is a great game. The story is great as well, Vaas is one of the most interesting and unpredictable villains in gaming. The ending was great as well, with a great choice at the end that your forced to make. Strong 9, the aforementioned downsides do not hurt the game as a whole and I do not regret my time with it.",

The thing I really dispise about Far Cry 3 is the interactive cinematics. They would be much better as non-interactive cinematics. Fortunately they make up a very small part of the overall game.  Everything else is really very good. The Crytech engine is outstandingly gorgeous. The story is good. The 4 player coop misions are fun, yet some can be a bit challenging with 3 players. The sandbox, the vehicles, the wild animals, the gameplay itself, are all quite excellent. Far Cry 3 is a first-rate addition to the amazingly great Far Cry franchise, just as you would suspect.",

The game is just fun. The engine runs well on my old toaster of a laptop, and I am glad that it does. It is not very often that I find myself in a game with a protagonist that is actually a dynamic chracter, much less a dynamic character paced along with the absurd situation in which he finds himself. The absurdities of playing any scenario that can pass as an open world FPS seem to make sense as your character vocalizes just how messed up it is to be gutting that deer carcass- the one with cinged hair (from an errant molitov cocktail) and far too many (SMG caliber) holes in it.  If you don't think too hard about why the spanglish-speaking Vass is running a slave ring in the south pacific, you may be able to take in the simple joys that FC3 has to offer. &lt;insert hunting 'x' with 'y' joke here... but I think the accidental or just incidental kills are just as entertaining...

            "review_text": "So I think for me, like alot of people, although I knew about the Far Cry franchise beforehand, Far Cry 3 was my introduction to it. As I came to expect from everything I had heard about it prior to me playing it, the Island setting of the game is absolutely beautiful. One of the highlights of the game is easily either finding a really high mountain or radio tower, or riding a hang glider, and looking off into the distance and seeing the full majesty of the game world, and also realizing that, for the most part, every place you can see is a palce you can go. The gun play, I will admit, is not the most satisfying, but it gets the job done (Although I loved the ripper LMG and the grenade launcher). I did have an awful lot of fun using the bow though, seeing just how far I could get a headshot from, and it was especially fun when you get fire and explosive arrows.   This next paragraph WILL contain spoilers so skip to the next one if you dont want them. Now on the note of the story and characters, the story is pretty much what it seems. You're a group of college students visiting a remote tropical Island which, SURPRISE, is teeming with drug dealing, slave trading, Pirates. In terms of the characters, I found it to be 50/50. Half of the character's SUCK. The main protagonist and his friends are barely tolerable at times with how generic they are. On the other hand, the characters on the Islands themselves, are actually pretty well done. You can tell they put alot of effort into the villains, and holy crap, Vaas is probably one of the best villains ever. He balances both humor and sadism perfectly, and I think it's kind of lame he wasn't really the main villain of the game. Now one HUGE gripe I have with the game is the ending (or endings). Basically in a sense, the game really tries to make you pick a certain choice. If you choose to stay on the Island with Citra, the game punishes you for it in several ways, and that just sort of kills it for me and makes me wonder why they even bothered giving you the option.  The game does actually do a reasonably good job of making you feel like you're out of your element, trying to survive on this remote Island........for awhile at least. Early on, the practice of hunting, gathering, exploring and activating radio towers to reveal the island and gain new supplies and weapons, the bounty and hunting misslons, searching for relics, and taking pirate outposts really to feeling of trying to survive....but once you get past a certain point, it starts to feel like busy work. Once you have all the weapons, activating all the towers, and taken all the out posts, there isn't much of a point to doing anything else and not finishing the game.  Ultimately, I did enjoy my time with Far Cry 3, and although it certainly isn't one of my favorite FPSs ever, I think anyone who enjoys open world games will find something to enjoy here.

Vaas is one of the greatest gaming villains of all time, he is so memorable, almost akin to the Joker. I love anything with a good original soundtrack and this soundtrack with its original music is unbeatable, there is no better soundtrack in gaming history. It may seem like a generic shooter, because that's what I thought and never gave it a shot, but it is anything but, you can hunt, sneak around, fly in a wingsuit, use ziplines, go boating, and tons of other stuff I'm forgetting. The story is enthralling as you grow with Jason, and the ending is the cherry on top. This game gave me a real sense of freedom and attachment to Jason I will never forget and come back to many times. This game is far better than most of the garbage being put out today.  The only gripe I have is that some things are not instantly interactive, for instance getting in a car requires aiming at the car in the right way, it's kinda silly, you should be able to just stand next to it and get in easily. Same thing with skinning. There is a lot of pop-in too, but it is an older game and very pretty none the less.",

Well, as it turns out, I was quite mistaken. Sure, the main character sucks, and sure pretty much everybody on Rook Island (Including him) are villanous to some capacity, but the game is fantastic. The setting is a small set of islands in the South Pacific, where you, and your brothers and friends, are taken captive by Vaas Montenegro, an unhinged pirate who revels in his insanity. In fact, it could be argued that he's the most sane of the villans since he acknowedges his mental state. But I digress. So, you're lucky enough to escape the slave trade, and declare a one-man war against Vaas and his pirates. The environment is not exactly varied, mostly what one would expect in an equitorial climate. Beach and jungle, with some mountains and old temple ruins thrown in for variety. The gameplay is fantastic. There is nothing as thrilling as mowing down pirates responding to an SOS call because you failed stealth to the tune of some odd dubstep/drums and bass track. The soundtrack is fantastic. It alternates between the former, and a quiet, pounding stealth track that plays whenever you silently dispatch pirates to gain access to their base. In this game, stealth is as much of an option as loud, and in fact I feel it is as fun, but have no fear. There are plenty of weapons to suit your needs should things not go as planned. Between the heart-pounding soundtrack, the variety of guns (go with the AK) and the option to do pretty much anything you want, any way you want, and the villan to end all villans, and I cannot see why you shouldn't play this game. Even if you like more futuristic FPS games (Like me) and you don't like the idea of slicing some pirate up with a machete in a hot, sweaty jungle, trust me; You'll be glad you did. In all honesty, I want Far cry 4 to be as good as Far Cry 3, but I don't know; the bar's been set almost impossibly high. Overall Score: 10/10",

The large variety of weapons yet limited carry capacity (Up to 4) can also lead to multiple playthroughs. I myslef started a second playthrough where I attempted to use pistols only.   My main problem with this game is that once you capture all the enemy bases, they stop spawning randomly around the world, and this ruins those few amazing moments at the start of the game where you have no weapons and have to hide from enemies as they drive past. This problem is very quickly fixed however as you can simply press a button in the gameplay menu that will fill the camps with enemies again and then teleports you back to the first base, which you unlock during a tutorial.  All in all, I would definitely recommend this game. It has a large amount of variety and a good amount of customization as well as an interesting story and one of gaming's best villains, which all come together to make one excellent game.",

For a first person shooter it is a good one. The cut scenes are good. This game makes you really hate the villains, and is kind of frustrating at times. The side quests are fun and the weaponry is top notch.  The only thing I hate about this game is climbing the radio towers! Them stupid things! My palms sweat and my heart races everytime I climb one, but you gotta do it. I just hate heights.   The best part of the game is    when you take the flame thrower to the weed crops with Skrillex music playing, and your character loves it! Not sure why he loves it so much... The other best parts are when you finally kill the bad guys! Such a stress reliever and a screw you!     The graphics in this game were way beyond my expectations. The voice acting is nice also. You really get into the characters.  So ya, get this game especially if it's on sale. Now I need to get Farcry 4 which I hear is even better! Waiting for the 2016 summer sale to get it cheap hopefully.   10/10 - Would avenge my brother's death again.      ",

Story's good until you kill Vaas, at that point I lost some interest. Gameplay's solid, it's a tad buggy though. AI's a bit iffy at times, but not terrible. Minor bugs here and there (animals falling underground, invisible water, ect.) Guns limited to 3 modifications is poor for immersion but nessacary for weapon balance, in my opinion. If the game's P416 had anymore rails it'd be a train, but it's still got a limit of 3 weapon mods. All around 7/10. If it wasn't for Uplay and the minor issues it'd be an easy 8.5/10.

            "review_text": "First off, let me say that while I have 100 hours recorded playing this game, there probably isnt near that much content. I experienced the notorious 'invisible walls' glitch, whereby my character would inexplicably stop and be unable to proceed forward, as though there was a wall in front of him, although nothing actually appeared on the screen. It took quite a bit of manipulating the movement keys, alternately crouching or standing up, backing off and running forward, and other such tricks to find the window to allow me to proceed. As such, climbing radio towers required quite an investment of time, hence the hours I racked up playing.  However, from the online search I did it seems that only a small minority of players experience this glitch, and even with it this game was immensely enjoyable. The designers did an exceptional job in not forcing you to play the game a certain way. You can achieve most of the objectives any way you like. So, if your prefernce is to stand off at a distance and dispatch opponents with silenced sniper rifles and bow shots you can do that. Alternately, you can sneak in and take opponents by stealth at close quarters. Or you could charge in guns blazing and blow everything up. Any of those methods will work.  The main story line is well done and proceeds at the right pace, without making you feel like its dictating yoru actions. There is lots to do on the island outside the main plot. You can search for relics, lost letters from Japanese servicemen stationed on the island during WWII, engage in races with all sorts of vehicles from boats to dune buggys to ATVs. Take a hangglider ride. Play some poker. Like I said lots to do.  My machine is pretty slow so I played the game on the lowets graphics settings and it still looked good to me, but Ive never put much emphasis on graphics so your opinion may be different.  All in all, and excellent FPS with a good stroy and excellent game design. Well worth adding to your games library, especially when it is on sale for less than $5. ",

It has a great emphasis on the protagonist's psyque, providing a very interesting and quite innovative way to immerse the player into the perspective of the character, going a bit deeper than the generic 'first person shooter' concept.   And as a FPS, it impresses on how polished the combat system is, not only it's fun, but it gives the player a lot of choices when it comes to approaching combat, from LMGs to a silent bow or sniper rifle, it satisfies all tastes, it will hardly disappoint.  Overall, as mentioned in the beggining, i find it hard to describe Far Cry 3, so i highlighted its most positive features, but as all games, its not perfect. However, its flaws seem almost insignificant considering how outstanding the game is.    It's also complicated to rate this game, 9.7/10? I'm not sure.

It seems to show the farcry logo, and then crash. Sometimes it wont even launch at all. It is possible to launch the game from file explorer, but things are still very inconsistent. In terms of the actual gameplay, the main charecters voice acting is cheezy and odd, but this is common in farcry games, but Vass is very well done. The graphics are fantastic, but the gameplay is nothing special compared to the other games currently on the market, while it is defently a pioneer. Im not too ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off since I got it for 7 bucks but I am really hoping to find a fix. Edit: Okay so I finally got the game working. It had something to do with buggy multi-threading.

I've put in over 15 hours of gameplay only to discover to my horror that the saves it was meant to save (by default to the cloud) somehow failed, and I lost over 10 hours of gameplay! All my hunting for upgrades, over 20 outposts, I'm gutted, truly. But as I said, this game is indeed amazing and I'll take this one on the chin and trod along, making doubly sure my games are being saved (have we not come so far into the gaming world where this is inate?).  To add insult to injury, uPlay is EXTREMELY intrusive, and one can't even get to the Main Menu without it wanting to download this and download that, download profiles, download stats, it takes a whole couple of minutes EACH TIME before you get into the game! You wanna do trials? Oh ho ho, lets sync (think) first. I've had to force myself to play in offline mode (once again PATHETIC!) just to be able to run the game like the hundreds of other games I have in my library. And the first time uPlay install? Let me just say it kept looping with one of its 'infamous' updates...  But this is the last time I EVER support Ubisoft, I'm sorry, but they are appalling. If I wanted to play a Ubisoft game, I'd buy the game and play it via uPlay, but I have STEAM for a reason and it’s just really silly that I have to play a uPlay game THROUGH STEAM. Origin and uPlay need to come to an agreement to release games to STEAM (aka individual keys). They can certainly count on me never buying one of their products again. Hopefully they learn from the giant how to do things right.",

You start killing the same enemies, start recieving the same missions, and you are even forced to travel halfway across the map between missions.   Then there's the protagonist. His profile indicated he is a grown man- but his voice actor makes him sound like a disney-channel sitcom teen. This shattered it for me. His expressions even made me cringe well into the game.

The story is terribly written in my opinion and doesnt fit at all in the far cry series. the gameplay is very repetetive, with each outpost having the same structure. it comes too predicable that even at the hardest difficulty you can easily do well at the game just using a pistol.   In the story (Both co-op and single player) it's just cliche after cliche after cliche. It happens so often that it just gets annoying and it just feels awful. You get no connection to the protagonist at all, you won't llike him, you don't even want to be him and wish he'd just jump off a cliff, break his ankles and left there for no one to be found ever. Neither do you feel connected to the world. In most games you get a sense of where you are, roads feel familiar, certain parts feel like home. In this game it is just jungle after beach after dirt road and they all just seem the same.  The story is full of spiritual nonsense that could fit in a setting centuries ago or in a different kind of world (where magic and unicorns exist), but not in the 21-st century on a tropical island where everybody has 17 guns. If you have a gun, you don't need some pretentious spiritual power to kill just another thug with a group of his guards. Honestly, the only way the game is fun is to just avoid all storyline missions, not using the map and running around blindly shooting people. Basically what Far Cry 2 consisted of.  The co-op is kind of alright in the game. The campaign doesnt really have that much story (this doesn't really matter though, it's about shooting things with your friends). It consists of multiple chapters which can be played chronologically. It's fun to do a few times, but the problem is that all these chapters are so repetetive and contain the same things, you never get a nice surprise. The worst part is the extreme glitchiness in Co-op. Anybody has a ping over 60? Fat chance that when you respawn after everyone dies, somebody on your team will just randomly drop dead and has to wait for the next checkpoint. Or he seems to appear on top of a building, while you're standing inside it. Good luck saving him when he gets incapacitated. Furthermore it is impossible to play with 2 players, as random kicks without a visible reason happen very often. if you play it with 2, and one gets kicked, you automatically get booted because 'there aren't enough players.' Say goodbye to your progress.  All in all, get off the store page, and spend your money on a better game. But not this, don't do this to yourself.",

Obviously, there's a crafting system that involves gutting and skinning animals that you hunt. It's gross and I can get past that. That's not the disgusting that bothers me. The enemies are pretty rough characters -- drug runners, kidnappers and mercenaries. Looting them will yield an assortment of colorful vendor fodder like dirty needles, crackpipes and the sort. This bothers me a bit...but I can get past it. The game, however, seems to pride itself in what an ugly world and situation it places you in. Loading screens treat you with random, stream-of-consciousness words, a few of which are obscenities. Of course the in-game dialog is repleat with obscenities. I guess you can't have a modern 'gritty' game without them. At this point, I'm swallowing a lot of ugly for the sake of the game play, which holds up pretty well until you start hitting certain progression walls.  Like many games claiming to be open worlds, the world is gradually revealed or unlocked through progression in the story. Character skills and crafting recipes are similarly locked to your storyline. In the end, it was these restrictions that put me off to the game entirely. I hated the storyline for the game's ugliness I described above. I just didn't want to run through it. However, with at least half of the game world locked away behind irritating game content, I lost my will to play the game at all. And cheat codes don't help you much in escort missions in which NPCs will gladly take cover in front of enemy gunfire.  All of that said, I laud CryTek for what they tried to do here -- open world shooting with crafting and skill systems that feel lifted from the latest MMO. I loved that concept. I just wish it weren't tied to content that made me feel worse for playing the game.",

This is because Ubisoft chooses to not have dedicated servers and make people play through their service called uPlay. You can't play with steam friends. You have to add your friends on uPlay. You don't get steam achievements, you get uPlay achievements. uPlay is literally the dumbest thing ever and Ubisoft should be ashamed of themselves for releasing Farcry 3 and not EVER fixing the multiplayer crashes and bugs.

I was so disappointed in the game that I felt like I wasted the $60 I paid. The game itself seemed to be quite buggy and it even prevented me from playing it at full quality. Due to the fact that I have ATI drivers and not Nvidia, the game itself would not go over 15-25 frames at a resolution of 1600x900 on low quality.  When this game came out I was playing BF3 and Max Payne 3 at ultra settings getting 45-60 frames. There was no reason that this game should have been performing as terribly as it was.   I even contacted Ubisoft customer support to resolve the issue I was having. All they told me was the typical stuff such as update drivers etc. I had already done the basics and they couldn't offer more help except to casually claim there would be an update soon. It was an update that never came. The game was s*** and you guys obviously didn't care. All you cared about was raking in the cash while you could. ATI users were screwed and it was plain to see that it was just an overall bad port to PC. Just like the recent Watch_Dogs, lots of PC users were left sitting with a game that didn't operate up to the specs they claimed originally.   Now let's talk about the multiplayer. What was that trash? Attempting to create a fun or at least competitive multiplayer seemed none existant. The multiplayer probably should have been left out of this shiny gem. The map editor was fun, thanks for allowing me to make maps for a terrible multiplayer. Far Cry 2 wasn't the greatest but at least it was broken like the multiplayer and coop was for 3. And coop was not necessary at all. Again it was attempted to make a competitive/fun coop by allowing up to 4 players to run amuk. The only problem was the coop was close to being a rail shooter due to how linear it was setup. Making an 'open world' game closed for coop was probably one of the dumber decisions you could have made in this game.  [Spoilers ahead] So the story you guys made, it was okay I guess. It had some merits but some of it seemed quite childish and silly mostly. You play a typical white guy who despite his stupid rich friends seems to be able to pick up any gun and just blow away the baddies like it's no big deal at all. Later some how you become the leader of a bunch of islanders and start a revolution, while also tripping major balls on drugs and fighting weird tiki monsters that look absolutely ridiculous. Oh and let's not forget all the while this story is happening you are killing hundreds of endangered species and taking their hides to make a bigger wallet to store the money you take off the bodies of the hundreds of mercs you laid waste to. If you weren't busy skinning a giant helpless tortoise or gliding around oddly placed japanese bunkers you were likely blowing up outpost after outpost slowly boring yourself to death. Overall the story seemed way far fetched and just ridiculous. Who will you choose at the end? Your stupid rich friends, or your new crazy islander wackos. The choice is up to you bucko! Oh boy it's over, thank you!  So to conclude my review of this game. Thank you for a bad port to PC, again. Thank you for not catering to all drivers in the PC gaming world, again. And lastly thank you for wasting $60 of my hard earned money, again.",

Okay, maybe you won't really agree that the game has some race problems like I do, but at the very least, I didn't care at all about the main characters which is kind of a huge issue. I don't mind a heart of darkness retelling, actually in fact I love them, Spec Ops: The Line for instance is an incredible game and does this similar kind of story in all the right ways. Far Cry 3, however, feels like the story and missions were the almgamation of many different studios with different ideas that don't all quite fit, for instance a pretty hefty part of the game is spent trying to find a knife with supernatural like properties but then you never really do anything with it, leading me to think that Far Cry 3 may have at one time had a more realistic supernatual element to it like the Tomb Raider games.   I suppose the shooting was actually quite good but it wasn't that much of an improvement over Far Cry 2, and I did have some fun playing it some of the time, but I just couldn't get invested in the action going on because I didn't care at all about what was going on or what what was happening to the characters. My biggest issue in gameplay is that it never feels rewarding and often feels too much of a chore and I'm someone who grinded like no other in WoW and other games so this was a huge issue for me.  And I guess you could say, 'well it isn't about the story it is about exploring around and exploding stuff.' Okay sure, I don't agree because I think this game is trying to tonally be a story heavy game, but If I were to accept that I think there is a lot of problems making a game playing a priveleged, wealthy white dude that finds it fun to kill scores of brown people in a developing, war-striffed country and while I did have fun with some of the shooting this was something that I kept thinking of in the back of my mind. It's not that you should have sympathy for the people he is kiling because they are pirates in human trafficing and drug trade. But, it is the fact that it was made by design to have the primary villians be people of color and you can only play as a wealthy, white dude.  I would be okay with racist elements, meaning I would still think they are racist, if the game was still enjoyable and redeamable in other aspects but the other aspects, I thought, were 'just okay' making the game not recomendable.  TL:DR It's okay. But, not good enough.",

Any game that requires the player to mash a set of buttons that are displayed by the game, in order to make it through a cinematic sequence, is a sad game indeed.( Like Simon says!) I got this game based on the reviews that this is a truly open world like GTA or Skyrim. But I found it to be very linier. You don’t have much of a choice in most objectives in the main story and side quest limit you to a specific weapon or require you to be unseen, or worst of all restricts you to a mission area. It is frustrating to say the least. The game is not all bad it is very beautiful graphics that are slightly improved from far cry 2. And I did find what I was looking for when I chose to ignore the main story and just drove around killing pirates and taking bases. The AI is slightly improved, and the story is very rich. This is one of those games you get and play to the finish maybe fart around a little, then delete and never look back Crysis, Far cry, Farcry2, and now Farcry3. I thank god I got it on a deal from steam cause if I had paid full price I think I would be screaming louder to not get it.

Well, the problem is simple: this game is too easy, short, and loses the comparison with precursors noted before. I've playied this game at the maximum difficulty available, excluding all the powerups until the end when some preconfigured mini-mission make you fail if you cannot reload in 1 second or heal after 3 rockets reach in your face :P  Inside the Freeroaming the game have a so beautiful and fluid graphic that I despair about the level design they made. You just have a 30 enemy outpost to conquer. And believe me that I've conquered 5 of them throwing a flame bottle in blindness from the wall behind, and other opening with 3 shoots the cage of the Bear or the Tiger.  And like FarCry2 there are no flying vehicles or freeroaming of the sky... but why?! Every good game from GTA3 reward the player with helicopter at the middle of the main mission, allowing a change of perspective! Still in FarCry3 you will only fly versus the earth. Enemies will attack with medium stupidity and are dressed in RED! And also a small bush will hide you. Stealth assassination are funny, but not always performable because you cannot sneak prone or hide corpses,so you will be discovered.  And the dead-with-a-car session are stupid. Not funny and not interesting. Using sea vehicles is also boring, you can only travel someway around without be entertained. No races with opponents are present, just you and your shadow in a fully single but very single experience. The worst of everything remains that there are no enemy to ambush once the mini-base has been conquered. FarCry2 was more hardcore about that... so you go for hunting. I've killed about everything with the BOW, but mission that force you to use a selected gun force you to use also guns that you dislike... The flamethrower for example have a 3 meters range... have you ever seen a 1942 war documentary? 35meters of range is the entry level... What you will do in all the game is to search for crates that open and return you a bunch of money and a dolly without the head. Is that funny?

For a start skyrim like all of bethesda's masterpieces is loaded with an unthamomable veriaty of intreguing areas, NPCs, and side quests that lure you, seduce you willingly away from the main story path time and again and have you whiling away countless hours wondering whats round the next corner carefully choosing who you will side with, who you will or will not help, while this game does the exact ♥♥♥♥ing opposite, beyond the primary story and a pitifull bounty board this game offers little more than farming for crafting material. Yes you can re activate towers, take over shanty towns and every single one of them is near identical and makes itself so easy a monky could be trained to do it but are more like obsticals designed to prolong your play-through time than, there is NO dialogue choices, NO path choices, the quests themselves offer NO choices in terms of order and rout, and throughout the game your option is either to fight head on, or sneak. It may be an open free roaming map but you're simply going in strait lines from one linier dungeon to another one at a time following the most utterly ♥♥♥♥ing predictable storyline iv ever seen in a game like this one. even the gunplay is just tailered to the average child who grew up played you know what of duty. but all this i could forgive ALL OF IT, if only the AIs wernt so utterly stupid, they will either rush you or stand slowly shooting at you maybe tossing the occaisional nade. The wildlife aspect is obviousely a random script event but even with its most random ilussion is notyhing more than an gimmick to make the world seem alittle more alive but really its just saying spawn animal here, spawn pirates there, animal force target pirates and places that infront of you. even the pirate jeeps are limited to half the speed of other vehicals obviousely to prevent them from chasing you too far, WHY? why cant they chase me to the end of the map? that would be 1 interesting aspect of the gameplay, 1 purpose for it being in a sandbox map and not just a platform game. Yes i can see the apeal if you like pretty shooters, but to compare any aspect of this game to skyrim is absurd its more like xcrash bandicoot with guns and not in a good way. really I play MMOs that are less repetative and more interesting than this over produced soap oprah and thats speaking from a single player standing point, I could go on.

'Mashing' is a ridiculous action to perform on a PC, and undesirable to do on any platform outside of a video arcade. This game has potential (open world, interesting crafting system, and good voice acting), but the execution of the gameplay and stability is very subpar.  All of the above makes the game below average, and then there is the Uplay DRM. There are plenty of other reviews that cover Uplay, none of which are positive.  Edit: I am saddened that I cannot rate this game lower than 'Not Recommended'. On my second day of playing, while trying to load my saved game, the game has crashed 3 times on 3 attempts.

The crafting aspect is just a gimmick to inconvenience the player for about 4 hours, and then quickly just becomes an awkward way to generate syringes (medkits).

The protagonist's hitbox feels like a large rectangle that barely fits on any staircase- I literally spend 10-30 seconds trying to get on a staircase.   Slightly uneven floors gets you stuck, and sometimes it seemed that corpses did it too- maybe the controls are just unresponsive. On the note of unresponsive controls, the RPG-7 is a great example. After reloading then ADS, there is a good 2 seconds where the game refuses to let you fire. The inconsistency with takedown prompts makes the cool knifing sequences not worth it- easier to just gun people down with a silenced weapon. AI is dumb as three sacks of bricks at a potato salad factory. The difficulty only seems to make you die faster, and Master (Very Hard), is not Very Hard. Only 'hard' part of the game is when it throws you into situations that your current loadout is not good for, and you are too lazy to restart the mission.  I've died more times falling from radio towers than from guns. The whole radio tower climbing thing is horribly annoying and not enjoyable whatsoever. The devs must have confused Far Cry 3 with Rock Climbing Simulator 1990. Every uneven surface will get you stuck, and unwanted vaulting animations will make your character joyfully leap to his death. Whole radio tower ordeal seems like a rip from Assassin's Creed. Too bad Ubisoft didn't also add free climbing so the whole thing didn't suck. No persistent Load Last Save option shows that this game lacks features that even the original Halo had.  Only completed this game so that I would never have to come back to it. Last note: lots of unskippable cutscenes. Quick-time events often restart you before a unskippable cutscene. Good recipe for fun. Even Battlefield 3 knows not to restart the player at the beginning of cutscenes when restarting a failed quick-time event.   3/10 Looks pretty. But, just play Far Cry 2 instead.",

All the bad guys are jamaican-accented drug addicts who think that anything and everything should be f*cked. It's the same half-dozen f*ck laced lines over and over again. The main character is whiny and weak, but still manages to say f*ck all the time. The main villain is clearly the main villain because he uses mother-f*cker instead of just f*cker. Interactions with your girlfriend and other characters are what I consider unrealistic and often come across as whiny, self-priviledged, and lacking in motivation.  Bottom Line: I think it's a lot of fun to run around the island exploring things. It's too bad that they let the story 'artists' butcher it with shallow, low-brow, dialog.",

The field of view in a car is not right.   - Gameplay is great, but there are some mechanics that could be refined.  - Examples: If you do a knife takedown, you can throw knives through walls  - Mines only blow up cars when the car is occupied.

Uplay updates are downloaded one at a time, from servers that are always down or suuuuuuuuuper slow. If there are 6 updates you cant just download the last one. No, you have to get them all.

I've never really liked that approach bit its not a deal breaker. The real PITA is the uplay UI. It does not mesh too well with steam. Launches its own window but then I have to click on a steam dialog or it wlll launch another uplay ui. It's almost like Ubisoft wants to punish you for playing on a computer rather than a console. If they want my money they need to do a better job meshing with the delivery portal (don't sell it on steam if your drm does not work well on it).  Gameplay is pretty fun.

            "review_text": "While this game is well ported with a natural control scheme and graphics that run smoothly the game it's self is lacking. Sure on the surface there is plenty to do. In fact in order to 'level' your character you actually have to do a variety of different open world missions in order to earn xp, and more importantly upgrade your weapon and ammo capacity. That's a great way to make the players engage the open world that you have created. From that perspective alone the game is fun. Though there are some annoyances with scripted events spawning guys after you shot everyone else in that area which is annoying cause you think you've cleared it out already. The driving controls are bad. I'd rather just walk everywhere then use a vehicle if I can. Being able to sneak around the jungle is cool. Where the game really falls apart is the 'good guy' side of the character cast. How you ask? Let's meet the characters. *SOME SPOILERS AHEAD*  First up is token black guy with generic foreign accent. Could be Islander, Jamaican, African or Finnish, who knows, it's terrible. Then he wears a US Marine button down because he was in America and/or in the US military but had to leave because he was a bad cab driver or something? I don't know. He is such an odd character that by the time he opens up about his “mysterious past” in the story I'm at the point where I don't care, just tell me what I have to do for the quest. He teaches you the whole time about the power of the tattoo/tat-tau and being a warrior and how it saved him from being a lost soul. Except he never does anything warrior like and is a total train wreck emotionally the entire game. He's like Lord Friend Zone from Game of Thrones except LFZ has his stuff together and actually does stuff. This guy just mopes around his hut all day trying to give you tattoos and ♥♥♥♥♥es at you on the radio because you aren't saving the entire island single handily fast enough.  Then comes the generic cast of native islander people. Who are covered from taint to septum in tattoo which are suppose to be earned and represent bad-assery except that these guys literally help you do nothing. They can't even take a single out post by themselves nor seem to do anything other then occasionally get into horrible car accidents while driving around for no reason instead of helping you fight the pirate occupiers. Thank God Chad, the generic frat bro comes along to rescue them from their own inept misery. Doing so by learning about their bad ♥♥♥ warrior culture which they themselves can't seem to harness for their own good.  Finally you meet the warrior-goddess-priestess chick who leads the physical and spiritual rebellion against the pirate/slaver MNC? She happens of course to be the one hot chick on the entire island chain who advances your warrior training by swinging her hips around seductively. Gets you broodingly to do rando missions that finally result in her roofieing you and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ you. But you don't seem to mind cause she's hot, even though you have a girlfriend? And because you finally sleep with her she and because of her major cracker-jack fever, she goes all psyco-girlfriend on you and forces you to choose between her and your actual girlfriend. One of which will be your sex toy war prize for winning the other will be brutalized and killed. Wonderful.  Finally there is the cast of generic frat bros and sorority sis's who you came to the island with. Regardless of relationship to you they all are at times incredible weak (this is understandable they are very traumatized from being captured by human slavers) to incredibly strong like killing people and flying helicopters. Then snap back to being really weak again, brooding and definitely on their moral high horse because you're 'questionably' killing people while being a bad ♥♥♥ and saving them from being sex slaves. On top of all the whinny-ness the one who is your girlfriend, once saved, gets all weird because you're showing strength and resolve by saving a repressed island from the sex trafficking trade and from a life of slavery at the hands of pirates. She seems to prefer and does her best to push you back from warrior crusader, who is fighting for good, to Chad who lives off daddy's allowance while drinking bud light on the couch of the families third vacation home all day. Also she immediately starts planning your life for you again after you rescue her? Super annoying.   Now the story is saved by two incredibly well written bad guys whose monologues and character interactions are amazingly entertaining and you truly feel a sense of both anger at them for their actions, but a sense of justification in their own actions in their insanity and evilness. They see what they are doing as both bettering the economy of the island and bringing a better life along with all the corruption. They make naturally unlikable bad guys with out being too cliche.   The CIA officer and his German mercenary friend are also both very entertaining and lend well to the story.  The game is worth it on sale. But the weak female characters, whose soul purpose in the story is to be prize objects annoyed me. Especially since one is suppose to be a warrior priestess who like voodoo-tattoo lord friend zone really never does anything worthy of the title warrior. I don't think either of them can even actually use a weapon. They could have done so much more with the story. Either by simply leaving some of these characters out, or by making their contributions to the story more meaningful and less weak. In the end it feels like we are just left with a tale where white frat boy Chad comes and saves his weak bros and some brown people by becoming a brooding emotionally scarred PTSD Rambo who machine guns his way through an entire Black Water battalion of pirate slavers. And it could have been more of that as an action style movie/game with less weak characters, or less of that with more of a cast of strong supporting characters who support the main character's growth as a warrior and as a person.",

Negative  Okay, so I got this game against my better judgement (one word: UPlay), since it was on sale. While steam does state that a UPlay account is required, I assumed it wouldn't be  that bad . After you install the game, you will have to make a uplay acount and activate the game on uplay, after which it then looks for updates. Technically, this would be it, you are good to go and play the game....  ...except:    Every time you want to play the game you have to launch uplay. Yes, every time. Not just once 'to activate', but  every. single. time.  *sigh*    Let's say you like to play in offline mode. Or you don't have internet (yes that is a thing, unfortionately not everyone is lucky enough to have the privilege of an always-on internet connection) then you can play Farcry 3, you can even set Uplay to launch in 'offline mode'. This however does not stop Farcry from trying to connect to the Ubisoft servers whenever you press ESC. If it cannot connect, you do not get the option to press some sort of 'connect' button, but instead the game just retries the next time you enter the menu.    Savgames. For me, the savegame backup function of Uplay didn't work, resulting in me losing my saves. While this might be down to my own internet speeds, firewall setup/whatever-other-thing-you-can-think-of, the problem is trying to restore savegames. Other peoples savegames to be exact.  Normally, when you loose your savegame, you either start the game from scratch, or you download a savegame from the internet. Well, you guessed it, Ubisoft won't let you. For whatever reason you are not able to install someone else's savegame anymore (apparently you used to be able to do that, but not anymore). I tried, I failed, and I've given up...    Positive  Now, if I just ignore the technical faults of this game, I can still think of plenty of good reasons (as tempting as it is to just vent my frustration)  Now, let me say that I don't really know much about what is considered good or bad graphics, but I think it's safe to say that Farcry 3 has some pretty decent graphics. And as a bonus, it even supports borderless fullscreen mode! (More games should have that, easier to Alt-Tab that way...)  The Story of Farcry 3 was pretty good, and I still think that this is one of the few games that really manages to get the concept of character development accross. You start off as a 'normal dude' and, well...I don't really want to spoil the story, but you really get to feel Jason's emotions and thoughts. The first time Jason kills someone for example, he's not just 'meh, just another NPC' but he is actually shocked. I can't really put it into words, but this is one of the things the game does well.  Next: Music. The game features some background music everytime you drive a vehicle, which is pretty nice. Not as immersive as the radio stations found in games like GTA or Sleeping dogs, but still a pretty nice touch. They also fit in with the whole Tropical-Island-Theme. That's not all though. For me personally, there were two instances when the music was just perfect in every way. The first being when you go around in a flamethrower (trust me, you'll know which mission I mean) and near the end of the game, a mission involving escaping in a helicopter (again, you'll know which mission). You can drive cars and boats, fly using gliders and swim and dive. The entire game is open world as well, which makes it that much more fun. There are a lot of things to discover like caves, hiding secret relics or crashed planes where letters of long-dead soldiers can be found. Weapons can also be customized both in ability (more ammo, better aiming and the like) as well as in appearance (using pre-defined color schemes you can select). In addition to this there are also a lot of skills you can learn and things you can craft. To craft, animals must be hunted and plants collected. The game's length is alright, but it can be extended if you bother to collect some relics or go explore every now and then.    Overall, yes it is a good game, however this is a PC, and the reason many of us are playing it on PC is because they do not want to put up with all the negative aspects of consoles. This means being able to use your own savegame files, no mater where you got them from! In addition to this, I am puzzled why steam would sell a game that basically just launches another marketplace that is trying to compete with steam... Thats like taking a BMW for a test drive just to drive to your local Mercedes dealer...  Even though I myself will think twice before buying anything from Ubisoft again, I tried to write this review as fairly and nicely as possible. Hopefully it is somewhat balanced.",

What open world play? Once you have a map area cleared what is there left to do? Stand in a field and take a pop shot at animals?  What irks me most though is this game has absolutely no originalty and there was just a sense of boredom playing it, the terrain doesn't even change for example. The devs have a chance of creating an open world full of possibilities and they just deliver a linear story which isn't immersive or fun in any way.  If you're looking to buy this, even on a sale then don't bother. Do yourself a favour and get Just Cause 2 or 3. Similar story line and similar environment bu JC2 is great fun. Come on, who doesn't like hijacking a helicopter, taking it to the nearest base/oil rig/etc and just going to town on it. It's good fun.  Far Cry 3 Cons: * Boring unbelievable story. How does 1 tourist take over a series of islands that a whole army of tribal warriors couldn't? * Main character (Jason Brody) could do with a slap * Monotonous terrain * Keystrokes take an age to activate e.g. hold q to heal, by the time that kicks in you're dead * The local animals are just a hinderance e.g. in the middle of a fire fight, a tiger comes in and kills you * Repetitious game play * Not enough modes of transport  Pros: * Can't think of any",

Repeated crashes, problems every other week with the PC port. Mandatory overriding of steam for the UPlay software which causes a plethora of other problems. For the hassle, I wish I'd never bought the game.",

I bought this game for the single player campaign, but because in modern world there's no such thing as singleplayer and every game has to have multiplayer, I need to be in contact with Ubisoft's server at all times. The game evens runs fine when the connection isn't working but everytime I open either map or menu I need to wait about half a minute if Ubisoft has gotten their server online. Seriously no problems on my end, sometimes it just happens to works other times it doesn't. Maybe it's because I'm not French and as everyone who is not French knows, French people are rude ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.  Also Far Cry 2 is better.  I give this game a rating of '♥♥♥♥ You / 10'  Sincerely, a paying customer",
