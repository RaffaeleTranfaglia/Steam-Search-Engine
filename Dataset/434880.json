I have yet to reach the third level, but this is one of those games where I have to step back and think before every action and I love that. Did get it on sale, because I'm not sure if it's woth $10, but it sure is worth $5.",

            "review_text": "Had the normal retail been only $3 I might've been able to recommend but unfortunately  there is no sense of progress in this game, since nothing carries over from play to play, and the content/gameplay is only slightly more advanced than a freebee like Minesweeper.  The game also suffers embarrasingly from 'Little Man Syndrome' where in it tries to overcompensate it's shortcomings by attempting to offer a 'hardcore' challenge. That challenge (however) fails leaving the impression that playtesters (if any) just got a lucky draw during thier randomization. More or less the game relies a lot on luck; how generous the level drawn for you is from the start.  A bit of Casino Slots mixed with an OS complimentary game; neither asking for $12  I'd suggest waiting for Hieroglyphica to turn up in a bundle or a holiday sale for $3 or less.",
