There's a ton of levels to try to beat and they're all very challenging.  The slow-mo feature is a little bit gimmicky, you won't find yourself using it all too often.   It's honestly a fantastic little time-waster. You'll get your money's worth and more.       Visuals: 9/10   - beautiful visuals for what they are. Soundodger+ really nailed it.  Soundtrack: 10/10  - the music, of course, is fantastic. It's the main selling point.  Gameplay: 8/10  - a bit repetitive at times, but still engaging and fun gameplay.  Price: 9/10   - it's a pretty good value, no complaints about price here.",

            "review_text": "I like shmups. I like single screen systems. I like abstract graphics &amp; mechanics. I like music generated/beat matched systems. A developer called Bean appears to have decided to make a game just for me. Just me.  Single screen, no player shooting, with various enemies flying around, launched in time with the light electronica that's playing. You avoid them until the music runs out. If you collide (and the collision is very generous in the player's favour), the current enemies go zooming off as the music fast forwards, and you lose score. To get yourself out of danger, you can press a key to temporarily slow down music to give breathing space to dodge.  Repeat until the music ends.  It is utterly wonderful. I haven't played a single screen shooter as pure &amp; focused (and without ridiculous neon/bloom) in a long time.",

            "review_text": "An incredibly fun, minimalistic bullet-hell rhythm game, that I had a ton of fun playing around with. The levels in this game all feel natural and everything that fires at you fires at the right time. Think of Beat Hazard but with actual structure to it. Nothing about this game feels out of place and everything flows naturally.   The level editor, coupled with the tutorials from the developer himself, are very simple to grasp and use. And with the community making so many pretty good levels, there's plenty of content that this game provides. The auto-generated levels are not so good, as it's not even close to being as deep as the core levels are, basing more on the loudness of the track over any indtrumentation going on.  And of course, the soundtrack is great too! It has songs that I've had on since I bought the game and listen to regurlarly. The songs fit the game perfectly with their instrumentation and melodies and provide an amazing look when paired with the visuals.  In my short time with this game, I've had tons of fun with it. Everything is easy to grapple with and incredibly fun, I definitely recommend it for rhythm game fans.",

For those of you who have played rock band or guitar hero, this game is very similar. Except for the fact that instead of hitting the notes you're trying to avoid them and instead of the notes coming in a straight line they come from circles that circle you. I definetly recommend that you get this game right now its only $3.99 or $4.99 for DLC, that will end on December 3rd, in which case it will go back to its original price, so get it while its on sale.",

Been able to reliably score above 90% on most songs that way, or at least above 75% on the advanced versions.  The auto-gen is good enough to keep in-sync with the music close enough that my advice does work. Find a beat that works, and some seemingly suicidal moves will dodge damn-near everything, provided you move correctly, or can read the music well enough alongside the shots being fired.  EDIT: Additional pro-tip: Got your own music collection, legit or not? If you want it to play at all, convert it to mp3 at 44100Hz with a program like Format Factory or something. You know, just so you don't have to learn it the hard way like I did. Considering the music warps when you slow-down or get hurt, it makes sense to have it set like that.",

If you've ever played any arcade shooter, you already played soundodger. It's far from perfect and further from being original, but you will definitely forget about that once the music kicks in! You're a little circle that dodges the particles made by the music itself.   You dodge the sounds of music eminated by the likes of Austin Wintory, Mike Forst, and Disasterpeace! If you don't, the music will become mixed up and will transport ahead of your mistake, while keeping track of your percentages. You can also enter into a bullet-time like mode, but be warned; if you do it will affect your overall percentage! You can go a whole song in this mode, but you'll never complete with a 100% because of this.   It isn't without it's faults either, unfortunately! My main problem is it's repetitive nature, of course every game like this is going to be repetitive, but this is different. Like after a while (20 minutes I'd say) you're going to be bored with it. Not to mention the tracklist starts over when you hit the new levels! The game does have a level editor, which you can import songs and track it yourself, but the problem here is it's tedium. You'll be sitting at your desk, face smooshed into the screen, trying to get that one bullet into the perfect spot.  In reality, if you have time to kill, this game is right up your ally! It has a great soundtrack composed of some of the most talented personnel, ever. This game is meant to fill the gaps between shower and bed time or coffee and work!   Is it worth your money?
