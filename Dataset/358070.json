            "review_text": "I originally played this game on Itch.io and really loved it. The pixel art is lovely and the music is soothing :)  There aren't any tutorials or instructions, although there are journal entries with specific information on each fungus/insect that are unlocked after a species survives for a long enough time. This means that the player will need to observe the behaviours of the insects and fungi in order to determine how to properly care for them. Some are herbivores, some carnivores - some fungi even eat bugs.  Balancing the ecosystem is both challenging and rewarding. A species can easily die off if they over-consume their food source, for example. Some insects are bad at climbing terrain and may get stuck in an area with no food.  The player is given Intervention points which replenish over time, and allow them to add insects or fungi, change the weather, or alter the terrain. Choosing a random insect, fungi, or weather effect to add is significantly less expensive than choosing something specific, but of course the player receives less control over what will be added to the ecosystem when it is randomized.  Insects can be picked up and moved by the player, allowing them the option to manually balance the ecosystem. Fungi, however, cannot be moved.  Earthtongue can be addictive to play, but also fun to just leave running while I do other things. It's exciting to come back and see what has grown, which populations have survived, or which species have gone completely extinct ;)",

            "review_text": "Have you ever wanted your own alien terrarium? Because that's pretty much what Earthtongue is.  This is a quietly interesting sim that works best as something to quietly tinker with in the background. You could try to micromanage it further, but I enjoy it most when I just pop in occasionally to check how things are going.  Sometimes that means coming back to discover a towering pile of roaches cannibalizing the bodies of their fallen brethren.",

Unlocking their journal pages and learning more about them, especially learning exactly how they work after observing them doing their thing for some time, is a lot of fun!",

            "review_text": "A pleasant little 'vivarium game,' in which your only real task is to watch the rise and fall of various fungus and insect species on a sunless planet. The game encourages you to try to build a diverse, sustainable ecosystem, rewarding the successful preservation of species with detailed journal entries about their behaviors. As you play more and more -- and catalogue more and more species -- you're also treated to some additional journal entries that reveal something like a backstory, showing who/what you are, and why you're watching the game unfold. A charming pixel aesthetic and a soundtrack that seems like it's straight out of the NES round out the package.  Gameplay is a relatively passive affair compared to other 'build-and-watch' games, like SimCity. You can reposition bugs and fungus spores at will with a click of your mouse, but for meatier tasks (reshaping the planet tile by tile, introducing new species, summoning rain or lifeform-eradicating meteor showers, etc.), you are charged 'intervention points,' which build up over time. Consequently, a good chunk of the game consists of making something happen, sitting back and watching the effects, and then making another thing happen a little while later. You can accelerate the rate at which you accrue intervention points by having more biomass on your planet (i.e., more fungi and bugs crawling around at any given moment), and you are also given three speeds (and a pause button) for making time pass more quickly.  The forced passivity of Earthtongue is at once a good and bad thing. On the plus side, it encourages you to observe and strategize, knowing that time is another resource to manage, and your absence from the world another factor to account for as you play. It makes for a far different gameplay experience than you might be accustomed to seeing. On the negative end, it's sometimes irritating to have to sit around doing nothing while waiting to save up enough intervention points to perform several major maneuvers in succession.  Aside from what gripes the game's setup may entail, I've noticed a couple of issues with the game itself. First -- and worst -- is slowdown. When my planet is absolutely crawling with wildlife, the framerate suffers noticeably, and sometimes a portion of the planet won't even have loaded by the time I pan over to it. Second is the slight difficulty involved with clicking and moving things. Some spores are so tiny that you'll click one by accident as you try to pick up a bug, and you'll have no idea you're dragging the spore along as you frantically try to click anything else.  Even with these complaints, I can assure you that I've never once felt frustrated playing Earthtongue. It is as close to a zero-stress experience as I've ever had. It can be mildly irritating to have one of your bugs or fungi face extinction, but you can always re-introduce them later for a few intervention points. If you don't like how your planet is turning out, you can always wipe out its population with a meteor shower, or start over entirely with a single button press. There are no failures in Earthtongue -- only setbacks faced on your way to a goal that you yourself set.  I recommend this game enthusiastically and without hesitation. Play it because it's a neat game. Stick with it because it's an experience.",
