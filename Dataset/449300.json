            "review_text": "Wow. This game totally took me by surprise. So much fun!! It sucked me in and I found myself in that 'just one more turn' mode, just like many of the Civilization games, Heroes of Might and Magic, or Age of Wonders have done in the past for me. There is an awful lot to keep you playing; here's a brief summary:  - treasure chests with loot dotting the landscape encourage exploration - the different planes - the numerous challenges / adventure locations with rewards  - the difficulty : for me, just right. Ex: wandering enemies have mixed stacks of units and use the spells / skills at their disposal. Your cities are defendable through careful planning, but the wandering monsters remain a challenge throughout the game - heroes and unlockable perks - combat is fun and addictive / reminds me of Heroes of Might and Magic III with a wide variety of spells and tactical options to explore and discover - researching new spells; weighing the cost vs. reward, immediate vs. long-term benefits -so much potential as well for development and expansions  I heartily recommend it.

            "review_text": "It's a decent game but needs polish. I like Fallen Enchantress Legendary Heroes or AOW3 much better but this game has a lot of potential. This is the first time I have given a thumbs up to a mobile port, yes it was a computer game first but then ported to mobile and now ported back.  PROS - Many different spells, items, styles of play. If you like this genre then you should think this is at least decent. The different races play very differently. I find the game to be pretty difficult which is usually nice. It has good replay value since most of the races are so different and there are endless spell/trait combos for your Lord. Heroes are nice and neat to get but the regular high end units are better until you can get your heroes all decked out in good gear. The heroes allso seem to have a wide variety of classes, skills and spells which is nice that they aren\\'t just a few cookie cutter guys with different names. AD&amp;D based spells and monsters.  CONS - It needs polish. Many little things like errors in the game manual, example is one trait that says it gives units a +25% exp bonus when in game it says +5%, some graphics need to be reworked, example the summon spirit spell summons a spirit that looks like it\\'s a pencil outline with blue color added, The AI seems to cheat, example an AI lord can have many cities, armies etc much faster than possible even if you play the same Lord on the same settings and try it yourself, that shows on even the easiest settings. Lack of options - yes there are a zillion Lord setup options but the game world and oponents there are not so many and even though the devs are actively involved and fixing bugs etc. they consider the game fully complete and I don't think that it is. The planes options when starting a game, you can only pick a maximum of one of each plane, what if you wanted a game with 3 paradise and 3 negative planes to make it life vs. death kind of thing, it's not happening, no settings to make the neutrals more or less aggressive, world events more or less common, can\\'t disable spell trading so the AI's can sit there and trade ack and forth with each other to far out do your research. There are many popups which is great but they need more detail and more of them. I click on some funky shrub on the map and it shows a figure and an up arrow, I have no idea what exactly that means and there\\'s nothing anywhere explaining it. Do I need to build a town there or just have it in my borders? Borders don\\'t expand. There is no campaign of any kind, it\\'s a skirmish game only. No options that I can see for your camera, if you have 5 scouts set to auto the camera will zoom all over following each one, maybe I don\\'t care what the scoucts are doing and I just want them clearing away the fog, No option for the camera speed, set 5 scouts to explore and you'll have a headache from the camera ripping around to follow them, that's even with fast movement turned off. No option to set unit behaviors, like scout for exp chests or scout for mana/gold and leave the exp chests, can't tell the scouts to auto interact when they find unguarded locations or to even always fight like an agressive mode.  So that's it. I think it\\'s ok and I'll play it some more. I think that it could be a great game though with some more work. Even if they just polish up the little things and then do a DLC to add more options/content then it could be great. It is good enough that I can give it a thumbs up.",

The game makes more sense now, and is starting to feel like a modern Master of Magic... but I don\\'t have enough playtime logged to say for sure if it warrants that lofty comparison. My only complaint with the game is that the overland map is \\'muddy\\'. Everything sort of mushes together, and it is hard to pick out your cities, units and interesting features. I would prefer a simpler, more symbolic map that was easier to read at a glance.  EDIT: The most recent change that sped up the AI turn is great and does wonders for gameplay.",

Even the starting screens, while nicer looking don't give you as much context anymore in choosing your starting spell classes. Also, splitting armies is very unintuitive (in fact, even knowing there is an army to split is more confusing.  I think they need to bring back the old interface and then I'll go back to playing it - I liked it much better before.",

Calling your customer a troll when a customer has valid concerns about the game is the fastest way to hurt ones reputation. Fortunately however Aaron did give me a refund so he is a good man but as for the game I would avoid this game. It's a failed attempt at recreating what we grew up with as teens when enjoying Masters of Magic.  The only thing close to Masters of Magic would be Age of Wonders 3 that did get it right.  The Battle System in this game is poorly designed along with the world map. The Heroes no longer have paper dolls and you cannot see items being equipped by heroes.   As for the A.I well I have heard there is nothing to be desired here... Go play Warlock 2 along with Age of Wonders 3 or even Legendary Heroes Fallen Enchantress they are class A+ titles. I would give this a F rating.",

This game is great and it totally fits the bill. It achieves the vision of WoM quite well, I think, and I've been hooked on it since it appeared in my Steam library. Enjoy.",

The second part is the turn based battles that happen when you interact with a map feature or when you battle another Mage/Neutral City. The overall game is fun but there are alot of minor things that need perfecting. There is no indication of why the other mages have the opinion they have about you. The auto battle system will sometimes let your units die when facing enemies that you could easily beat with no death. Ranged units have ammo but their is no indication(that I saw) of how much ammo a troop starts with or has in battle. Starting up a game can be a bit confusing at first because of how their are mutiple realms but it defualts to one (I imagine that most players would like to play with all of them on) and the game has a certain amount of bugs but I didn't find any that ruined the game.

So it is interesting that I choose to write my first review centered on this game... interesting to me anyway.  I suppose allot of that has to do with my desire over the years to see a successful remake of MoM... starting with the graphics which were most in need of repair. Sadly, this is not it (and I am one of the not so proud owners of Worlds of Magic). And while there are many successful fantasy/strategy games available... each with its own flaws, but playable and enjoyable all of the same... this game is not that either.  For me there are a number of deal breakers starting with the graphics which are at best subpar and removes any experience of emersion. Moreover the interface is clunky and it is easy to select and move the wrong units. And while it may well be there is a game hidden somewhere under the hood, the lack of feed back makes this a difficult thing to discover, and given what I have already written the discovery process a labor that is in my opinion not worth the effort.  Finally, as this is the company's second attempt to remake this game, and given the aborted effort of the first, I would not hold out hope that the flaws, which are serious and run deep, will be given more than a cursory make over.  My advice is to save your money as there are many more worthy efforts already existent including the original MoM.",

Just moving units in this game (especially if you've got a stack but don't want to move all of them) is tedious and confusing. And God help you if you try to actually fight a combat, the interface is confusing and when the enemy gives you a vicious beatdown, you're not even sure why or how you could have done better. I suppose I could also mention the awful city interface as well. Confusing and involving way too many clicks to get done what needs to be done. This is all too bad. I love 4X games, and I was really stoked to play this game. Fortunately, I realized its awfulness in time to get a refund. If this game ever reaches the point where it's actually playable and fun, I may consider purchasing again.
