            "review_text": "TL;DR - It's an adorable sidescrolling racer that's a throwback to charming Japanese-made Playstation and Dreamcast games visually. With cute-but-chunky 3D visuals, bright &amp; colorful textures and stylized background art, it particularly recalls games like Klonoa or Threads of Fate. If you were worried about controls or something, don't be. This may be simple but its well made. Angel Express is just a fun, simple little game. And its a pretty unique spin on the platformer. If you like the looks of it, and enjoy games like Klonoa, don't hesitate to pick this up!   What is this? - Angel Express plays like a hybrid platformer and 'kart' racer. You can jump, double jump and use a dash if you've built up enough juice to use it in your special bar. The heroine generally feels pretty good to control: she's speedy enough, responsive, collides with the environment correctly, stops well, has a good jump &amp; double jump, and a good bounce off of targets. So with a solid feel under its belt but just a small group of core game mechanics, the Pickups are where some gameplay depth is served up... though its still a pretty simple, pick-up-and-play type of game overall. You race through a stage 3 times (for laps), picking up gems and items from treasure chests, while avoiding traps and enemies (or stomping them/using items to clear them out of your way). The levels are even destructible to a certain extent, so watch where you're throwing those bombs ;) Every area has two unique tracks, except for the last area at the end of your run. There, you'll find just one track, and you'll have to fight a boss. Angel Express also features a world map with branching paths that opens up after you complete your first playthrough too; more on that in a bit.  How is it? - There's a nice selection of levels with varied themes, a cute little story (told through short asides between stages), and multiple stage types. Some are straightforward 'just beat the level before the timer runs down'-style challenges. Others may change things up with environmental effects such as adding fog to decreases visibility. Several stages pit you against your rival. Some pit you against multiple opponents, and then there are the bosses. The boss fights are not always races; you'll have to do battle with some of them by avoiding attack patterns, gathering treasure chests and then unloading items onto the boss. The progression is a little weird, as you don't have free reign on the World Map. You'll be run through 4 stage courses straight to a quickie end. Then you continue that game, and head down the world map again, this time taking different branches throughout your runs to see more stages and endings. Its kind of like Outrun, how that game would start in the same area and then give you different end points depending on which forks you took throughout the race? That's how Angel Express' World Map works.  Any downsides? - The momentum makes it hard to slow down and actually land on 1-block platforms while racing, and the collision tends to get messy in VS races when colliding with other players, and also on certain traps/items - namely, the spinners. I also saw slowdown whenever there were more than 2 messengers running. Heck, there'd be random, minimal, slowdown during those 2-player races too, but its far worse in 3 or 4-player. Its like playing the whole stage in bullet time... which is actually pretty okay. It just made it easier to react to, and appreciate, all the chaos going on during those stages, honestly. Any little annoyances don't really equal frustration or even difficulty; you shouldn't have to retry a stage more than once or twice to actually get through any of them, and the punishment for losing is... getting to try again. This may surprise you, but this cheerful &amp; colorful adorable game isn't big on punishing the player :P   Wrap up - That's really all there is to it. Fun races and challenge types, with a good little chunk of levels to play through, plus the ability to make your own. This won't be clogging up your backlog; you'll actually be able to get through this in a few hours, but it'll all be enjoyable. This is bright and cheery, with cute music and characters, and a solid, charming script (honestly, there's far fewer misspelled words than I ever would've expected. Good work, devs!). This is the kind of game not a lot of people make anymore, and when you pick this up, you'll be reminded of how sad that is. This game is a gem for fans of instantly fun arcadey action and pure positivity.  ------  Notes about the Level Creator: It's pretty good. Its kind of like a basic Mario Maker; you scroll through the stage and drag and drop elements from a menu -- your tiles, blocks, traps, gems, enemies, etc. -- onto the grid to make your level. It's pretty intuitive. The only thing that's weird to me is that there's no 'instant test' option; so you have to Save it out, then leave Edit, then go to Time Trial, THEN select your 'Edit Stages' and pick it there to try it out.",
