            "review_text": "  Take Thy Throne is a very enjoyable, charming, and unique 2D Sidescrolling Tower Defense mutliplayer based game with a lot of potential.  It has a few game modes available right now, such as the Tutorial, Take Thy Throne, Capture the Flag, and Dragon Slayer.  In Take thy Throne, your objective is to get to the enemy’s fortress and defeat their king to win the game. In Capture the Flag, a flag is spawned somewhere on the map and you must find it, and bring it back to your fortress to score a point for your team. In Dragon Slayer, you must keep killing dragons until one player’s lives are depleted.   There are multiple classes to choose from, and each serves a different purpose, and plays differently. One example is the Helper class whose main job is not to fight off enemy attackers, but to mine ore, and chop wood to provide resources to expand or fortify your fortress.  The developers are very kind and diligent with updates, and are hard at work to continually improve the game, and to promote it as much as possible with new maps, new classes, and recently the addition of achievements, and trading cards. There’s plenty of new content to come such as Dragon Wars, Team Deathmatch game modes, and maps, only to name a few.  The main problem with Take Thy Throne right now is lack of players online. As it's a fairly new game, word of mouth and advertising needs to take place, and really promote the game so more people can come online and enjoy the game. Right now, I'd recommend getting a group of friends to play the game, as it is hard to get into games with other players right now or try asking around on the forums to see if other players would like to play with you.  After some more improvements, and more players coming online, I can really see this game taking off, and really attracting a more wide and diverse audience ",

            "review_text": "====Overall=====  In my opinion, this game has massive potential. The art design, the classes, the team-oriented gamemodes, a lot of this is promising. Just be aware that there are little to no people playing the game as it just came out. Give it some time. I will change this to Not Recommend if within a few weeks it doesn't pick up players.  =====Pros=====  -Helpful tutorial that teaches you the rundown of the game: that's always a useful thing to have in a game. Nice.  -Couple of gamemodes to play, and more promised by the developers: Take the Throne, CTF, and a Vs Dragon Slayer, it's good for a game to have more than one gamemode to keep things from going stale  -Art design: nice animations, colorful maps and characters; I personally dig the art style  -Several classes: Ranging from being an Honor Guard absorbing damage or being a Helper gathering resources, there seems to be a class for every type of player. This can really improve teamwork, and give people different playstyles to choose from  -The price: 3/4 bucks in my opinion is WELL worth a game with this much content.   =====Cons=====  -The Main Menu/UI: Personally, the buttons lacking any animations/reactions bothers me. Makes navigating clunky. I would suggest animated buttons or some more noticeable reactionnoises in the future. I try refreshing the page not knowing if I actually did anything or not.  -No controller support: perhaps in the future  -Lack of players at the moment  -Can't change controls: that's always needed honestly",
