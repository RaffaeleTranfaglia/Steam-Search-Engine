            "review_text": "An intriguing game. A friend showed me some of the game, and it looked rather neat - a puzzle game with platforming interludes, and story that's shown, not told. A lot of it's up to interpretation, so you can take as much or as little as you want from what you see. The hidden scenes and items rewards thorough exploration and expert execution of gameplay; however, some are a bit rude in that reaching them involves doing things that ultimately gets you stuck and requires that you jump off the level to respawn at the last checkpoint.  Gameplay-wise, barely anything is repeated to the point where you feel like you're going through the motions. There's nothing that's done only once in the level, but there's nothing that's re-used in later levels with an irritating twist (ie time limits). Every level holds a new challenge, so you're unlikely to get bored.  The puzzles start out simple, and sometimes have a hint to the solution in plain sight (though you might not register it at first); at other times, they can be rather difficult to conquer, to the point where you'd be tempted to look up a solution. Some of those puzzles guard unlockables, but others guard the way forward, so it can become a bit frustrating. The platforming is the sort of thing you'd expect from something built in Unreal Engine; some sections can be rather difficult to surpass because of finicky jumping mechanics, whilst others are a breeze in comparison.  The graphics are freaking amazing. Lots of eerie backgdrops and landscapes that range from bright and cheery islands to darkened tunnels lit only by glowing mushrooms, distant lights, and the eyes of creatures looking to swallow you whole. It's all thematic, of course - going along with the story, everything is representative of something involving the story being told. Which doesn't stop the game from looking quite wonderful.  The music is quite nice as well - going along well with the themes of the levels, occasionally bringing me back to games I'd played before with the way instruments were used. Going through a factory level, the music reminded me of the old Crash Bandicoot games on the PS1. It, too, plays into the story, though more for setting the tone than anything.  In the time I watched it played by a friend, and in my time playing it, the game only glitched out once - the time I was watching my friend play, a platforming section bugged out and became unwinnable due to a platform reversing its solid state; this was fixed with a reload of the map. The rest of the game was bug-free, which is to be expected.  It's not got a long run-time, but that means you can dedicate a day to sitting down, playing through the game to completion, then finishing it with 100% achievements.  It's definitely worth the low price that the developers are asking for the game, so I highly recommend giving it a look!",

            "review_text": "This is definantly a game to get when your board.  Nilo is as it says, a puzzle game. In that respect i'd say it's done pretty well. There's alot of different puzzles in it for sure.  The story is still something I'm trying to figure out, it's one of those games where there is little to no talking and alot of it come in the form of secrets you have to activly search for  At first glance the game looks uninteresting and lacking in detail, I say it's not about the detail, it's about how much you use it. The game knows how to build atmosphire pretty well, this in mostly because of the music and ambiance.  There are some things I have to critisize though, the intro cinematic feels way too long, and there are times where your inability to walk slow definitely tests your patience, but over all, I'd say this game is just shy of 8/10 and I'd say it's worth your money.",

            "review_text": "Pretty, but amateurish. The hand drawn animation that starts the game looks like it was made by a 10 year old. Almost none of the settings are configurable, including mapping buttons, so you'll be moving around the maps using arrow keys like you're playing on a Commodore 64. Don't bother complaining in the forums about the game's shortcomings, the developer just deletes the posts without responding and bans you from the forum for pointing out problems with the game. I'll be requesting my refund from Steam.  tl;dr - Niko: Through The Dream is a waste of money.",
