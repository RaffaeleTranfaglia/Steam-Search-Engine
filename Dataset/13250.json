Still one of my favourite games of all times and the soundtrack is awesome. Although maybe not as good as the main game, the expansion pack Return to Na-Pali is included. I personally enjoyed it. Get the HD textures pack and tweaks from the net to get the most out of it and the game is still a lot of fun to play today. It also supports widescreen 1080p resolution.",

The day I bought the Voodoo 3 and popped it in, I loaded up Unreal. It lived up to its name. It was the most amazing thing I had ever seen at the time. Emerging from the prison ship to the planet's surface was astounding. Lighting effects, a giant waterfall with some particle effects, clouds in the sky that could obfuscate the sun, wild animals on the ground and in the air... Unreal showed us what was possible, pushing limits of systems for years after it came out, and spawning a series of games, and an everlasting engine of astounding magnitude.",

            "review_text": "As other reviews of this game have mentioned, Unreal is phenomenal! Of the first person shooters I've played, this one is way better than most. The amazingly rich environments suck you deep into the plight of the peaceful Nali and the cruel world of their oppressors. When you awaken in your cell, you are alone, the bodies of your shipmates bloodied and lifeless. Many are torn in two. Sirens and garbled voice recordings break the uneasy silence, as you crawl through the battered remains of the ship, only to find that you are the sole survivor, lost on a planet full of hostile beings intent on your demise. That is only the beginning, though. Your travels to escape the planet will lead you through many varied locations that are very easy to differentiate from one another, each one more visually stunning than the last. That is definately one of Unreal's strong points.  The brilliant designers do not allow for the levels to become tediously repetitive. Each environment has it's own personality. Another strong point, and perhaps most important, is the enemy. Long gone are the days of Doom when enemies would simply stand their ground, and trade fire with you. These enemies are much more cunning than that. They will use cover, snipe at you from high perches, duck fire, dodge and even call for back-up if neccessary. Some of your enemies will even try to draw you into traps and ambushes.  This game is exceptionally challenging and rewarding, making most shooters pale in comparison. I was most impressed with the dramatic lighting, ambient sound and music, utilized to it's full potential, making this lengthy epic bristle with life and tension. This is an ideal purchase for anyone who does'nt already have this classic in their library. You can take or leave the included expansion pack, as it simply doesn't offer much more variety to the original experience, but don't over-look this title due to it's now ridiculously low price. For unparalleled on-line battle, check out Unreal tournament.",

Exploration is typcailly rewarded with things such as ammo, armors, or other useful items. The enemies in this game come in all shapes and sizes, from the quick Skaarj to the gigantic Titans, and tend to get more difficult to deal with the deeper you are into the game.   It certainly wont hold up to todays graphical or story-based gaming standards, but for anyone who enjoys the old school shooters this is certainly a must have.",

The game is so atmospheric, the planet so beautiful and haunting, the feeling of isolation and desperation coming from being the only survivor stranded on a dangerous alien world is simply amazing. The levels are generally large and often non-linear, and each encounter feels like an intense threat; the Skaarj are smart and very dangerous. And to top it all off, the music is nothing short of fantastic, it really sucks you in.  The expansion pack is meh, feel free to skip it.",

            "review_text": "Unreal Gold is a slightly older version of Unreal Tournament with 2 single player campaigns and regular bot deathmatch.  It is not the first 3D FPS but it is the most important one because of its ground braking physics engine . Unreal is the point where modern FPS was born and the engine itself became groundwork for modern game developing tools .   These days we take much of what Unreal introduced for granted as a base line for what FPS should be. However back then it was ambitious to create a fluid FPS game in 3D . There isn't much I can say about gameplay as the game comes down to walking,shooting and pressing buttons .  I will say that there are some jump scares with predators XD This is the FPS that introduced a lot of enviromental 3D events . Sometimes lights will go off and some alien will brake through wall so he can kill you (these days it happens all the time right)  If a game like this came out today (and they have) I would not like it . However in respect to timeframe it is made Unreal was THE FPS . Right now game is $10 on sale and I would not recommend it for someone new to the series just because it is a generic game in 2015 and probably not worth it .  Perhaps this game isn't very good for new audience but if you are interested in the roots of FPS genre give it a try on sale .It has a charm that never fades away .",

            "review_text": "Not only one of my all-time favorite games now, but I'll even say one of the greatest, most impressive games ever ♥♥♥♥ING made. The original Unreal is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. Lots of awesome original weapons, all with alternate fires, all super fun, and with such meaty sound design. And you gotta love those super deep-voiced grunts when you jump. Lots of fascinating enemies and NPC interactions. Really great lore and worldbuilding from the text logs you can observe, and a real sense of scale and gravitas with the story despite the complete lack of dialogue. No cutscenes, all real-time and ambient, but with sick-♥♥♥ music. Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant map design, with breathtakingly expansive levels to explore.   Aesthetically, everything in the game is just beautiful, even today. Such colorful and lush sci fi landscapes and architecture, and not just the usual everything-is-metal-and-high-tech stuff you often think of when thinking of sci fi settings. It's truly an alien world... And the enemy AI is actually challenging and crazy smart, which is just astounding considering this is a game from 1998 and how lame AI often still is today. The game is really challenging in general, and it is very long.  When I think of a true JOURNEY of a game, I think of this very Unreal right here. No ♥♥♥♥ing Tournament, just plain-♥♥♥ original Unreal 1 right the ♥♥♥♥ here. It is positively... UNREAL, the places you'll go in this game. The very definition of an adventure. People always going on about how great Half-life is, but I honestly feel this game might be a notch or two more amazing than Half-life, for the same sorts of reasons Half-life 1 was/is awesome. And I do ♥♥♥♥ing LOVE Half-life. This game... This game gave me feelings, guys. Real ♥♥♥♥ing feelings. I was truly in awe. This game should be recognized more, and it has my 100% recommendation, especially considering the price.   The expansion, Return to Na Pali gives a bunch more levels for even more Unreal goodness and continues the story directly where Unreal 1 left off, but the player character is suddenly given a voice, and I think that goes against what the original Unreal was about. He'll (you'll) talk in between levels in some dumb kinda unncessary monologue about what just happened and what's going to happen next. So Return to Na Pali is the same fun as Unreal 1, but with some mediocre new narrative style. So even including Return to Na Pali and Unreal 2 (which goes even further into the voiced characters, try-hard hamfisted story ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t territory, and is really quite a different kind of game altogether), there truly hasn't been another game quite like Unreal since Unreal came out all these years ago, and while the Unreal Tournament games aren't bad, I think it's a damn shame Epic (Mega)Games never made another game as incredible in the way Unreal was. Here's hoping for a really good current-gen remake of some sort; this singleplayer Unreal truly deserves another chance in the spotlight. Or perhaps a whole new Unreal game altogether, if they can nail it like this one did, and take away from the stains of Return to Na Pali and Unreal 2. It is one of the most amazing experiences I've ever played, and I wish more people could understand what I'm talking about by playing the game for themselves. So go do that, reader! It's totally worth it, trust me on this one. That so few people talk about this game just astounds me. And there's also multiplayer, yes.",

Also, whilst it starts of very good, it starts to become too repetitive (unlike Quake 2, for example), and the last level is just horrible in my opinion. However, there are some nice puzzles, and I liked it most of the way into it, however it just became a chore to complete it for the sake of it. If the Unreal bundle is about £5 then give it a try, as there's still people playing UT, UT2005 and UT3 (if you can get multiplayer to work), so it forms a fair bundle of single and multiplayer games. And in my opinion, UT was always more fun than Quake 3/Arena. ",

There were no objectives or sense of communication in the game other the transmission logs. The maps are well designed but the weapons feel like they lack power and the AI is just plain annoying, and not because its hard , because it feels like randomly spawned and shallow in existence.

Enemies actually feel threatening, and feel like they're actual players fighting you rather than a computer bot. The basic Aliens (Skaarj) will take 3-6 ROCKETS to kill, talk about tough. They will bunny hop, circle strafe, match your movements, and avoid any projectile based attacks your give and literally dodge out of the way.  Not only the AI, but the level design, music, and satisfying feel of gunplay this game delives gives it the right to be titled 'Unreal'. The graphics are kinda bleh by today's standards and it looks like a ps2 game, but this was made way back in 1998, before the ps2 even existed. This was really impressive back then.  Everything in this game is perfect. nothing even felt repetetive, which is amazing to me because normally games start to feel very repetetive to me throughout the first half of the game.  Only thing I have to complain about is how complex the level design can be, and it can confuse alot of modern gamers because they wouldn't have the gaming instints of older players that know how to explore well. Very little hand holding. Even then it's a very minor complaint.  This is by far one of my all time favorite games, if you haven't played it, I don't know if you've either never heard of any of the unreal games and have been living under a friggin rock or some crap, or you haven't played the very first game that started it all.
