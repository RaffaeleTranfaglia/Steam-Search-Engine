            "review_text": "It's straightforward. The mechanics are simple. The purpose is clear. There's no confusion as to what you are expected to do and what tools you have to do it.   It's diabolical. The puzzles are sometimes bananas, requiring some pretty twisted logic and lateral thinking. While you strive for a solution, there's a constant nagging feeling that sometimes your solution is just  inelegant  and you need to do it better.  It's oddly darkly humorous. There's a strange undercurrent of defiance against your alien overlords, from listening to the audio diaries of the project managers who came before you, from resenting the food pellets that drop into your cell when you complete sections of the game.  It's also gorgeous - not so much in graphics, which are perfectly adequate, but in the efficiency of the presentation. No main menu. No weird visual effects cluttering up the screen. No unnecessarily ostentatious setpieces. No splash screen! On load, the game drops you right into where you left, so you can literally load the game and get building. There's a gorgeousness to seeing your machine, your factory do its work, and the satisfaction that comes with it makes the effort all the more worth it.  It's one of the most interesting puzzle games I've ever played, and I'm enjoying it hugely despite not being great at coming up with particularly creative solutions.",

            "review_text": " Like all Zachtronics products,  Infinifactory  is just outstanding in every way.  This game reminds me alot of my extensive time playing with redstone mechanics in  Minecraft . Alot of people will compare this to  SpaceChem , which is not entirely off-base, but it is much more in every way. Its much more polished, easier to control and deal with, and IMO a bit more enjoyable.   For those unfamiliar, this is a hardcore spatial puzzle solving game that involves manipulating voxels in certain ways to create or build an intended product.    Pros:  +Music is excellent (reminds me of  Donnie Darko  theme - Mad World) +Graphics and artwork are beautiful and appropriate +Controls are SOOOO tight - spot on and perfect +There is a meta-game and story which was refreshing to see (its not extensive, I don't think, but its cool none-the-less) +Puzzle difficulty starts reasonable and ramps up from there +Nothing is really that confusing - its clear what the goal is, and what you have to work with   Cons:  -Your brainy will hurty   Its pricey, but worth every cent.  This is a must have if you enjoy puzzle games at all. In fact, I highly recommend checking out and buying any game created by Zachtronics.",

            "review_text": "Like SpaceChem, this is a puzzle game that implicitly allows you to choose how much you want to challenge yourself.  Normal difficulty is just trying to solve every puzzle in any way that works, which, for those who haven't tried Zachtronics designed based puzzlers before, can still be a challenge. Hard difficulty is when you start itching to find an elegant solution that doesn't have a giant snarl of pushers and sensors each trying to fix some unfortunate stall or collision that popped up the first time you built a solution. Obsessive difficulty is when you decide you want to find a 'best' solution that absolutely minimizes cycles or size with no waste. Even some of the tutorial levels turn in diabolical puzzles at this level. If you go here, you will dream Infinifactories after hours of fiddling. You may even start scouring the web to see if someone somehow did it better (which will, most likely, make you cry or curse profusely). You can, quite frankly, devote as many hours of your life to this game as you wish to without running out of mental challenges if you set the bar high.  Rarely will you ever find a puzzle game that has the depth to admit such rewards from obsessive analytical thinking, if you are the sort of person for whom that holds any appeal. ",

Anyway, there is a very good reason this game is #1 for me, and its that this game realizes people are different, and think different. Because of this core theological stasis that relies in this game. There are so many ways to do the most minute of processes, and sometimes, you can get crazy overboard an make crazy factories. But its even more extreme when the thing you took the whole room the game gave you, you see someone else do it in 2/10ths the space. But then you go back to your giant factory and see it working, and remember you made it. And this repeating satisfaction factor makes you never lose fuel on this game. Its fun until the end. (If your smarter than me and can get there ;_;) The logic is pristine, being thoughtful of every possibility, and this gives crazy smart people the ability to go wild. This game is amazingly string pulling for the whole spectrum of intelegence. A lazy person could have fun, trying to make and improve the easiest way to do something.   In short, this game is near perfect, made amazingly by great developers. Infinifactory is to Puzzle as SMB is to Platformer.",

It's not a major one, but don't read on if you don't want spoilers. The story is that the enitre human race has been abducted by aliens who need workers to build factories for them because they're just too lazy to do it themselves (sounds very hitchhiker's, doesn't it?). It's a brilliant set up, the levels feel lonely and desolate, and the only human contact you have is through the audio logs you find on the bodies of people who have died during their abduction. However, the rest of the story doesn't carry on like this. Some humans who have managed to escape get you out aswell, and so you now must build factories to make products that will help with freeing others. This is where the story falls apart a bit (for me at least), as the levels immedietly lose that sense of isolation and the atmosphere just isn't there anymore. It no longer feels like you're the only person left alive, because you can just go back to the hub and talk to other people. I would have prefered it if the story had just kept you working for the overlords; perhaps you get a promotion, or you stay at the same level but learn more and more about the overlords through the experiences of the people you find dead. I don't know, this didn't really ruin the entire game for me, but I just wish the second part of the game was more like the first part, because I loved the atmosphere.  (Note: I haven't finished the game yet, so there may be another change in tone.)  Don't let what I have to say about the story put you off though. This is still a brilliant game and I highly recomend it!",

            "review_text": "Another sublime 'programming' game from the mad genius who brought us SpaceChem. This time you've been kidnapped by the alien overlords who have set you to building them factories.  Basically, you get given one or more 'inputs' (usually single blocks of different types) and (usually) one 'output' that's built from those blocks. You have to build a production line out of conveyer belts, welders, pistons, sensors, etc that can repeatedly turn the ipnuts into the outputs. All this is done in a Minecraft-like world of cubes (and the guy who created this game also created Infiniminer, which was a major inspiration for Minecraft).  Once you've solved the puzzle, you get three little graphs that show you how your solution compares to the solutions of all the other players in terms of how quickly it produces the required output, how many blocks you used, and how much space it took up. Then (if you're like me) comes the fun part: optimize, optimize, optimize, and try to get the best possible score in each of the metrics (most likely with three different solutions). The great thing about the graphs is that because nobody can see anyone else's scores, there's no real incentive for anyone to cheat, and because it doesn't show exact scores, You can aim for the slightly softer target of the top score bracket rather than being tormeted byt that one guy who has an insanely good score...  My new favourite pure puzzle game.",

            "review_text": "Infinifactory is a very open-ended puzzle game. You are presented with a bunch of input parts, and it's up to you to move and weld them in order to match them to the desired output. The factory that you put together to accomplish this purpose needs to synchronize the movement of all these individual pieces such that they interact cleanly, and don't accidentally push a piece one tile off and suddenly you have a massive traffic jam. Unlike some puzzle games, you're not stuck bashing your head trying to find the one and only solution - you're finding out how to make your own solution work.  For those who have played SpaceChem, you'll be right at home with these concepts. For those that haven't, I highly recommend you try the free demo for SpaceChem and see how you like that.  I find the difficulty in Infinifactory to be much more forgiving than in SpaceChem. You will never run out of room to come up with your solution - you have all the room in the world to make your solution as inelegant and bulky as possible if that's what it takes to make it work. Of course, the major appeal is still optimization. There are 3 categories to optimize for - complete the desired output in as little runtime as possible, use the least amount of vertical real estate, or use as few factory blocks as possible. The beauty of those optimized solutions is really what gives a great feeling of accomplishment to the players.  As detailed, the gameplay is extremely solid. The engine runs and loads smooth - there is nothing in the way of getting to the gameplay. There's a goofy story that entertains some, doesn't detract from the gameplay at all, but I would hardly consider it to be a major draw of the game. Graphics, sound, and music are all decent (music is a definite downgrade from SpaceChem).",

Each level has a goal object/objects, and you have to take the individual parts that come in, form them into that object/those objects, and then move them to the output area. It's really satisfying when you finish your machine and you watch it working perfectly, not wasting a single piece.  It also shows you some graphs at the end to compare your performance to everyone else's, so you can see if you made a big, slow, bulky and wasteful mess or a 100% efficient and compact machine.  If you're the kind of person who likes to tinker with stuff and make things do stuff, you'll like this game.",

            "review_text": "Infinifactory is the kind of game that only a certain type of people will enjoy. I can say that I fall under that category, and I thought it was fantastic. Due to its logical nature, Infinifactory is a game geared toward the same kind of people that enjoy programming; while playing, you'll likely find yourself using a lot of the same practices you might use when coding, such as building machines in 'sections', optimizing, and debugging. It's also a great way to know if coding is something you'd enjoy or not; if you don't like this game you probably shouldn't try programming either. The game has plenty of content, and as an added bonus, if you have friends who play the game you can compete to see who can build the smallest and/or most efficient machine (which really adds some good replay value).  Besides the fantastic and unique gameplay, the game has some pretty solid graphics and good, relaxing music. However, there's one thing about this game I find questionable, and that's the story. You've basically been 'captured' by 'alien overlords' who are forcing you to create these machines for them. Any story that uses those terms is very clearly cliché and uninteresting. Of course, no one is going to play this game for the story, but I think the game would be a lot more polished if the story were to be completely overhauled or even removed entirely (I do in fact like the space setting of the game worlds, and I think the game would work out just fine without any story whatsoever).  Don't let the stuff I said about the story turn you away from playing Infinifactory – it's still an amazing game, and I highly recommend it if you think you're up for the challenge (especially if you enjoy or are looking into programming).",

With a set of simple blocks, you're tasked with the creation of a factory which transforms one or more inputs into one or more final products.  The difficulty ranges from very simple to quite complex. For an added challenge, you can download user-generated puzzles via steamworks.  The story is charming and entertaining and it's neat to see a Zachtronics story with voice acting.  Each puzzle's solution tracks cycles, footprint, and block, enticing you to create three solutions which optimises each of these metrics to compete with the scores of your friends.  Overall, I love this game and recommend it!",

Although it is a fairly difficult game, every single time you complete a puzzle the game gives you a reason to keep playing (new parts, new levels, and challenging yourself to have complete mastery of the given challenge.) And the feeling you get whenever you finish the puzzle is complete and utter satisfaction.   Puzzle games aren't for everyone, but if you have a bunch of free time, I'd suggest this one. Infinifactory has been one of the best uses of my money and I think that if you buy it, it will be the same way for you.  Oh, and don't let me forget the soundtrack. The soundtrack from this game must be one of my favorites from all the games I have ever played. It goes perfectly with the tone of each puzzle as the story unfolds.  I'd recommend this game, let’s leave it at that!",

There's not a good debug mode to let you wander through walls or see through bricks in order to see what has become stuck deep inside a machine. All in all, this is more frustration than fun for me.
