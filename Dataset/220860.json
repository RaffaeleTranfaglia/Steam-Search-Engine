The graphics are intentionally (I think?) super crude, and the interactions between you (McPixel) and world objects are surreal and unpredictable, which gives the game its charm and character. The game wisely advises you to play it in short sittings and take breaks. Indeed, I found if I played more than one set of levels at a time the humor would kind of wear off, and since this game relies entirely on its humor, it stopped being fun very quickly. But then when I played it the next day it'd be fresh again. Some drawbacks: The music is repetitive; the graphics are overly crude, so much so that you can't always tell a clickable object exists; there's no achievements (I'm a little OCD so I like achievements). I think it's a little pricey at $5, but I bought it on sale so I think it was definitely worth whatever it was I paid. All in all, it's a quirky, silly game that   changes the entire genre   will put a smile on your face.",

McPixel is a fast paced humorous mini-puzzle game, where our main hero McPixel (an obvious reference to Macgyver) tries in 20 seconds to defuse a bomb and save the day. Everything is controlled with one mouse button and that's where it's charm lies. To use or pick up an item you just press it. And hope for the best. Sometimes pressing something (or someone) will pick that thing or even a person up to use with other items. In other cases, pressing will lead to McPixel kicking the said item or person. Usually that kick will result in everything blowing up. Sometimes the solution is to press on the fire to take your pants off and take a ♥♥♥♥, saving everyone's life. Pressing the fire in the next puzzle will make McPixel jump to the fire, combusting himself. In the third puzzle, pressing the bomb will make McPixel kick it, destroying half the city. The solutions range from simply press the fire extinguisher to extinguish bomb to kick a fat naked guy in the showers, so that he would slip on the soap and land on a bomb, defusing it. Every single solutions is stupid, yet brilliant at the same time. It also offers FREE DLC, a thing that you wouldn't get in a 60$ 'realistic millitary shooter'. And for a such a minimal price, you'd be an idiot not to try this game out. RECOMMENDED TO BUY.",

            "review_text": "Buy? Maybe. (My experience is based on the Android version) McPixel is a very stupid minigame-fest, where you must save the day by preventing a bomb from exploding in a variety of 20 scenarios. The idea is a sort of comedy based, retro-style take on MacGuyver, where you improvise a way to stop a bomb from exploding. This includes stuffing bombs into people, causing somebody to accidentally kick the bomb out, or straight up urniating on the bomb. The comedy overtly crude and immature, and probably the reason for it's popularity of 'Let's Play' videos with the younger audience. There are a few moments of laughs for me, especially the 'Insert Virigin' mission.  It's point and click adventure gameplay will unfairly throw people off - unlike most adventure games where you may find yourself stuck without a guide, this is the only adventure point and click I know of where there is a constant failure state built in either the 20 second time limit of each level or in your inability to find the right answer. Plus, the extreme simplicity of the controls where you can either click to interact or swipe/right click to skip removes unnecessary complexity from the genre. Yes, it's a tad annoying to fail, but it's over quickly and since you can only click on so few things, you will eventually find the answer. This alone makes this game worth playing or at least checking out to people with huge backlogs - the game is very short (3-5hrs) and it means you can play the game, even mindlessly and be able to finish without scratching your head very often (there are a couple head scratchers though).   There are no sound effects in the entire game beyond the title screen. It's strange how a game about explosions only uses it in the title screen versus the rest of the game. It could have been a conscious decision to let the zany, silly chiptune style music make the situation seem crazy, lazy game design, or possibly both. The biggest legimate annoyance is the humor of the game ♥♥♥♥ jokes, dry humping, crotch kicks - it all sounds like something written by a pre-teen and it will definitely annoy some people. Another very annoying aspect is having to replay level to 'find all the gags' in every level before you can reach the ending. This may offer some entertainment to players that enjoy this comedy, but for everybody else, it's an unnecessary grind, which is accentuated in the irritatingly boring, and unnecessary 'click everything and hope for the best' last level. Still, I'd say the $5 price tag matches the value of the game, though I'm glad I got this in a bundle which made it really cheap - I could say I wasted my time with this game, but I played it on my phone while there was down time at work - wasting time was the whole point.  By the way, I'd argue this game is better in short bursts on a mobile device than sitting down and playng on PC. The only reason why I have 10 hours logged was to farm trading cards - I wouldn't have installed it otherwise.",

Every stage you get around 30 seconds to save the day (often by stopping a bomb explosion). While the odds of beating a stage the first time are low, there's usually less than 10 permutations you can do on any given stage, so you'll figure it out quickly.  Similar to Wizorb, perhaps its best feature is how inexpensive it is - under $1 on a sale. Even less than that if it's in a bundle.  If you decide to play and don't feel like reading instructions, just don't forget that SPACE lets you skip just about all animations/intros. It will make your gameplay experience a hundred times better.  I finished most of the content, including seeing most of the gags, in about 3 hours. It was.. somewhat fun, I guess. Might have been better left as a Flash game. Still, I'll give it a 6.5 out of 10. Still recommended, but just barely, and only on a sale or in a bundle.

The gameplay is very simple point and click adventure style, the graphics are old school pixel art, and the music is something you expect from an Atari 2600 title, but all of it works perfectly together.  The puzzles are simple, yet clever. It's worth getting them wrong just for the hilarity of the consequences. I've been slapped by Buddah, had a cow fall in love with me, fed a hot dog to a pot-smoking alien, and made a man poop dynamite in the span of five minutes.   This game is absolutely worth $1.99. I haven't played long enough to know if it's worth the full price, but considering I've already laughed more at this than I would at most modern comedy movies in a theater, I'm going to tentatively say that yes. Yes it is. The developer has been really great about getting the word out about this game by giving out at least a couple hundred copies, and I really hope it pays off. I would definitely play more of his/her stuff.  For a simple, funny, pick-up-an-go game, McPixel delivers. And then explodes. Often.

            "review_text": "McPixel is a point-and-click adventure game with a very simple premise: in each stage, prevent a bomb from exploding within 20 seconds. The gameplay usually consists of interacting with various things on the screen and figuring out what the solution is, usually by deduction (there aren't that many possbilities per stage). If you lose, no problem. The pace is pretty quick, so you'll be back in the action soon enough. It's definitely a refreshing take on the genre, sort of like Half-Minute Hero.  A major part of this game is the crude humor. There's a ton of it. This is the sort of game that a 13-year-old boy would love to play but probably shouldn't. That said, I enjoyed the humor quite a bit. When you interact with something, the character normally tries to be a huge jerk. The default interaction with people is to kick them in the groin (male or female). If you're holding something, you'll probably hit them in the face with it too. McPixel rarely does what you expect him to, and that's a lot of what's so funny about the game.  The graphics are bad, but still charming. The music is a little grating. The controls are simple and effective. Keep in mind that this is a short game. I finished it 100% in three hours. Overall, I'd recommend McPixel if you find it cheap, especially for adventure game fans. It's not a bad way to spend an afternoon.",

The aim of the game is to locate and destroy/get rid of a bomb by clicking on objects on the screen. There are several stages which each has several levels.  The good points are that you get lots of levels (100) which you can happily sink alot of time in.   Now for the bad points. First off, although the game tries to be humorous by having you embarass or do terrible things to the characters in the game, some of the actions that the main character does may be offend/disturb people (e.g. peeing on an alien). Second is that when you start the game there is literally no tutorial which was somewhat frustrating trying to figure out what to do. Third issue is that when you fail to locate the bomb, you will proceed to the next level. The game then goes through all five levels of the stage untill you have disarmed the bomb in each stage. This forces you to remember exactly which items not to click on, but the main problem is that it is somewhat difficult to find which items can be interacted with. Fourth issue is that the game is extremely repetitive. Once you finished the first level, all the other levels are exactly the same except with new scenery. Fifth issue is that the music is really annoying as it plays 1 track for the ENTIRE game.  If you like point and click games, avoid this game. If you like a fun and enjoyable games, avoid this game. It isn't even worth $1 let alone $5.",

Each stage has like a few scenarios where you need to randomly click on the screen to complete a series of action. The puzzle is completely nonsensical and logic does no apply in the solution. There are a couple of actions and reactions in 1 scenario but only 1 action works. Even if you successfully complete a scenario, you are still required to try out all possible actions in order to score a gold. When you play, you can select the stage but not the scenarios in the stage. You are only given a couple of second to perform 1 complete possible action with 1 outcome before the game automatically switches to the next scenarion. It will repeat itself until you complete all the scenarions before you can replay the stage again to get gold.  The sound and music system in this game is repetitive and dull. After a while, it really got to my nerve and I decide to play the game in silence.  Personally I think this game fits to be a easter egg in bigger games like GTA or Saints Row where you can engage an arcade machine to play.  Oh and if you are looking to collect the cards, they do drop but at a much slower rate. My first card drop was at the hour mark (approximately there). My total play time includes a couple of minutes fiddling the game and the remaining was to collect cards.  The only thing I liked about this game is that you can change your pixel display style which I think its quite artistic in a way.",
