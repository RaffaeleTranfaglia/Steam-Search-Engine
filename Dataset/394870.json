            "review_text": "7.5/10 - Strangely Addicting; Way worth the Full Price  I had to do a double check after wasting several hours on this one. It has the same addictive quality you find in Clicker Heroâ€™s and Timberman. This time the game unfolds as an office beat em' up! Last Man/Woman standing gets to keep their jobs! Youâ€™ll use trashcans for helmets, rulers for swords and the list goes on! Maps and overall game is pretty simple but the combat and diversity of objectives keep me coming back for more.  There are over 60 challenging levels with several different modes including last man standing, survival, bosses and more! Each level alternates missions so things stay fresh and exciting; this is a totally achievable 100% at around 15 hours? It requires A LOT of level farming/grinding but totally doable; I typically watch something on TV in conjunction to playing this with no sound. I won't 100% this, after completing the game I still have hours and hours left. It's fun... but not that fun.  Well worth the $1! At least 7-10 hours of Campaign and Leveling!

If on sale, it might be worth the consideration.",

The same cluster of crappy 3d models chases you around, when they die their ragdoll death animation is just ridiculous (garry's mod-esque flailing). Weapons that are dropped by mobs will break within 15-20 hits, and from the first 6 skills I unlocked, It's a very boring skill tree to deal with.  In the end, this is just a game that was sloppily put together, but if you're one of those ironic gamers who like buying bad games to be ironic, this definitely is the game for you.",
