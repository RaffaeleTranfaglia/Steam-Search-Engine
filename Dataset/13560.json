            "review_text": "One of the last real stealth games, remains true through-out and does a great job never to go the route of turning into a sloppy dumbed down shooter with optional stealth, like 95% of stealth games do today!  The controls are decent, although few frustrating hiccups can occur, as you get more accustomed to the game these hiccups happen less and less frequently.  The graphics haven't aged a day, they look incredible and even more so when you take into consideration that this was released in 2002!  The sound is great and the dialogue is awesome, to sit in the shadows and listen to your enemies cheesy chatter is entertaining and very humourous.  I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoys stealth games",

            "review_text": " Splinter Cell is the first game to star Sam Fisher, and its success as a stealth series today is without question. Voiced by Michael Ironside (V: The Final Battle, Total Recall), it truly is a must-have game for any fan of the stealth-action genre.   As a gamer that has played the title on PS3 as part of the HD collection, I found the game to be a satisfying experience on the PC. It plays well on Windows 10 despite being an older title - the only noteworthy technical adjustments I felt I had to do were in the .init file, tweaking brightness and gamma to get the shadows in-sync with the stealth meter in-game. Links to optional mods and fixes to common problems can be found  here  - I used the Widescreen fix and the PS3 HD texture pack.  Overall the game is short, but can be much longer depending on your control setup and your ability to assess situations and how to tackle them. There are also some tricks that can be used to avoid detection or combat altogether.  After some research into getting my Dualshock 3 to work, I ended up resorting to keyboard and mouse. I was concerned over the difference in how speed of movement was handled (up and down on the mouse wheel as opposed to automatic with control stick pressure), but by the end of the training level I realised it wasn't impeding my gameplay, and that I actually enjoyed it. I recommend a mouse wheel with clicking intervals though. Movement speed is critical in terms of silence in this game.  As a stealth game, I find the most important aspect of the interface to be the stealth meter. In perfect darkness it becomes less important to stay slow and quiet because no one can see what's going on anyway. A variety of movement is available to Sam Fisher, including jumping, climbing, crouching, horizontal pipe traversing, and even wall jumps. It's possible to sneak up on guards to knock them out or grab and interrogate. Door codes, doors locked with retinal scans and locks that need to be picked all form major obstacles to your ability to progress (perhaps unsurprisingly). A quick menu is available to access such items as lockpicks, diversion cameras, smoke grenades and sticky shocker rounds (think taser/non-lethal KOs).  There is only one pistol and one special assault rifle. Using a weapon is as simple as unholstering, aiming, then firing. Thankfully everything is silenced. For the ultra-cautious, it's even possible to pop a little camera under a door to check if the next area is clear. It's also possible to use the pistol while hanging from a pipe - not many games could boast this sort of freedom way back when.  The one detraction I found comes in the form of the move whereby Sam jumps up a corridor wall to stand on the walls with his legs doing the splits over the corridor path. I didn't find any instances where I could do it. Perhaps I just didn't look hard enough. It seemed like such a pointless thing to show off during training though. I didn't much like the forced combat events either - but with practice it's possible to get through these with no kills / no damage too.  Gameplay is thoroughly enjoyable most of the time though. The different levels each offer something new, and are unique enough that the overall game doesn't become stagnant. There are instances where discovery by the enemy or just one alarm can mean game over, but for the mostpart you are free to choose combat or stealth. In my mind stealth is more rewarding anyway, and it's clear this is what the game was created for. There are many sections of the game that you will feel badass for getting through undetected, such as evading sniffer dogs, armoured cameras or lights that can't be shot out, or even time-sensitive events where you must be fast, queit and invisible all at once.  Splinter Cell has its funny moments too. There's a Chinese guard no one like to patrol with because of his outlandish theories on American hotdog stands being propoganda cells; one Colonel that everyone hates (one guard even spits on his food); one guard saying he's going to the 'little boys room', and he even sounds embarrassed about it. Even Fisher's limited dialogue is good for a laugh.  The colour palette is dark. It's a stealth game, yeah? You won't see much anyway if you spend the majority of the game with your night vision goggles on, as the whole game becomes greyscale. But if you enjoy great gameplay then little things like colour shouldn't matter. The important thing to remember is that this is Third Echelon and the government is relying on you. The nation's top brass will be seeing and hearing everything you do. Of course, covert ops is not something you forget. 'It's like riding a bike.'  'Or wearing high heels.'  It may not have achievements (such as its HD counterpart), but they can still be accomplished. A worthy addition to any gamer's library, at any price.",

You can technically do all the things you can do in the newest one. It is fairly easy, challenging at times but not so hard, it has nice realistic take on missions, you infiltrate get the orders and choose your path in whether stealthy killing, assault or no killing. All in all it was good experience, the story wasn't bad as well. However the aiming in this game is ridiculously horrible, even after you wait for the reticle to close you might spend a whole magazine trying to shoot a light, I dunno who saw him fit for the field and if you try to snipe, oh man you need to battle with the thing to get a shot, but It's cool there are alternate ways to shooting.

No really though, the stealth in the game is unlike any other 3rd person stealth title. Hiding in the shadows, climbing poles and epic splitting above people's heads. It's quite awesome.  The plot is Tom Clancy eque. He didn't write the game series, but he did create the character and the universe, so props, and RIP.

I gotta say that the game has aged rather well. It looks great and runs flawlessly with no visual bugs. I did find myself using quick-saves and quick-loads a lot. Sometimes the grab option doesnt show up when I sneak behind enemies, so they end up turning around and alerting everyone. There are some neat gadgets you can use to strategically take out enemies in different ways. You can shoot a distraction camera which attracts enemies by making noise and then takes them out with gas when they get close.  My only major complaint is that the tutorial never tells you that you can steady your sniper-scope aim by holding down the right mouse button. I didnt realize this until the final level of the game.  Anyway, I got a good 12 hours of play out of this, and its usually dirt cheap when its on sale.",

This is the first of 6 splinter cell games and is probably the most memorable one in my opinion though i've only played through the first 3 but i've seen gameplay of all. If you have only played Conviction or Blacklist which are the two latest ones, then you are going to be in for a shock of how difficult and hardcore the earlier games are, you have to actually sneak around the place and stick to the shadows, it is a game where you will constantly have to autosave and re-attempt sections multiple times before you get it right but that's what makes it so great, you can't go all in guns blazing because you will die in 10 seconds completely unlike conviction and blacklist. Yes the graphics are pretty terrible especially the cutscenes given the game was made in 2002 but the shadow system is better in this one than pandora tommorow and it has got a pretty good storyline with memorable level layouts, more so than even chaos theory which many would agree is the best one out of them all.",

            "review_text": "Old school stealth game through and through. Think more along the lines of Thief rather than Hitman or Dishonored. It's got lovely lighting and shadow effects and the models and environments look nice considering it's age. I'm a sucker for stealth game which don't hold your hand.  I found this game overly frustrating and medicore. It's frustrating because its shadow system, which reminded me heavily of the early Thief games at first, doesn't work half the time. You think you are sitting in darkness but the bar to the bottom right thinks otherwise, and everyone nearby opens fire on you. You fire back, and then realise too late that any deaths or more than one alert fails the mission. Your handler makes damn sure you know about it too. So insta-fail missions are in there too. Considering this was Ubisoft, why am I not surprised; they still employ it today in Assassins Creed.   The game's worst sins are the terrible controls for jumping (a mixture of movement keys and left-shift) and the level design. Trying to grab onto a ledge from above is trial and error gameplay at its worst. Double jumping correctly requires you to face the higher ledge you want to reach so the guy can pull himself up onto it. I found myself quicksaving not just when I was in a tight spot surrounding patrolling guards, but everytime I needed to make a jump or grab a ledge below. Jumping from a pipe to a balcony for instance, is just as bad, if not worse. It really does feel like the game is punishing you for trying to move forwards.  Moving forwards is ALL you do in this game. I thought older games had massive levels that you could easily get lost in? Not this one. Every level is a corridor or a courtyard. No grand palaces/agency complexes with multiple covert entrances or opportunities to enter. Nope, always one, every time. And there are plenty of scripted moments too. Really, it feels far more like Call of Duty: Stealth Edition than any other stealth game I know.   The story? Bleugh. It's about as bland as they get. The Russians, the Chinese and some nuclear weapons. Nothing interesting comes out of those things unless you add James Bond. And Splinter Cell guy certainly doesn't feel like a James Bond game, especially when you mistakenly double jump to your demise in the last mission because the movement is so damn arbritary.   All in all, I'd say it's not worth playing. There are better stealth games out there than Splinter Cell, much less frustrating yet no less challenging or rewarding. Try Styx: Master of Shadows, or Dishonored on V.Hard using no powers and with the HUD off. Linearity is better suited for fast paced action gaming like shooters or puzzle-based platformers, not patient and meticulous stealth gameplay. In the Splinter Cell series alone, there are also better games - Chaos Theory I've heard is everyone's favourite entry and one of its strengths is the variety of ways in approaching missions and carrying out objectives.  5/10",

Areas supposed to be brightly lit just aren't occasionally, and sometimes, I can still very obviously see Fisher even though he is in a supposed 'dark' area. This isn't too bad since you're always going to be looking at the light bar at the right to judge if you are visible or not, but when it comes to searchlights, there is almost no way to see where it is shining at, making these sections with searchlights very difficult. Another small issue is that Sam Fisher can't aim to save his life. Even though I am clearly on target, he almost always misses.

Every lighting source was correctly displayed with the exception of searchlights, which is rather disturbing, considering how important light is in the game.

I know the game is old but I don't think that excuses it from being held to some basic standards. For example, there are plenty of times when there are no lights in the room but the game's 'light detection system' shows the area as being well lit. Without night vision, it's pitch black, but the light indicator shows full visibility and enemies easily see you. It's either shoddy design or a nasty bug, but it happens way too often to be excusable in a game that relies on stealth through darkness. I've died too many times while shuffling through a dark alleyway to find out that every enemy sees me clear as day, and it becomes a game of watching the light indicator to ensure that there are no bugged out lights in your path.  There's also sound issues. You can be 20 feet from an enemy and he'll turn when you make a slight mistake. Normally you are able to move comfortably at a much closer distance, but sometimes enemies have superhuman hearing that ruins your plans. Another big issue is that when you move diagonally, you have to press 2 keys (W+A/D) and the game registers that as 2 movements, meaning anytime you move diagonally, you move twice as fast and make twice as much noise. You can work around this by only using W and moving the mouse to turn, but sometimes you need to keep an eye on other enemies and it isn't practical to make the compromise. Also, it might just be the design of the game, but your stealth walking speed is slower than an enemies normal walking speed, so if your behind an enemy who's walking away, you will not reach him to eliminate him. You'd think an NSA Splinter Cell would know how to move quickly and quietly but he's slow as a snail.  I would love to enjoy this game and I did for the most part. I just can't bother myself to finish it when the core mechanic of the game (stealth) is so flawed by bugs. The quicksave and quickload features got me through 9 hours of this game but I hate that I have to use those features because of the game's problems and not my own mistakes. If they ever remake this game with a new engine, I'd buy it in a heartbeat but I can't play it as it is. Stealth games should have working stealth mechanics and this game is just bad enough that I don't want to play anymore.",

A few bugs with the enemy AI sometimes.  The lack of a proper map or directional arrow makes progress a lot slower, even if the game is linear, as in you have a lot of 'jammed' doors until you do x or y, where is x and y, who knows.   Chaos Theory improves in every way.",
