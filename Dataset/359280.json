There are secret areas, a small range of items to buy and a modest menagerie of enemies.  The characters have slight differences but they don't make a vast impact on your progress.  I would say that the game really needs more achievements. The only one that took a bit of time was slaying 5000 monsters.  Looking forward to the sequel.",

But oh well, I haven't played a game like this in a very long time so this will keep me entertained! :D  Do I recommend this game? Yes I do! If you like cute little pixel games, then this is a game you'll like! Just be prepared for no online Co-op. :&gt;",
