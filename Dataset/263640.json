            "review_text": "Updated: July 3, 2015  This is an official update for my review. I keep telling everyone that branding this game as being bad does nothing, but people nowadays just hate to love and love to hate. This isn't just criticism; it's pessimism. Reviews and criticism in general have become more like a competition for most people. Rate the game as the worst one, and no one will want to buy it because they're stupid enough to believe anything. Either you play the game, or don't play it at all. Accept it the way it is, or bugger off! And if you don't want it to be stuck in your Steam account forever, watch the game on YouTube and other video sites before you buy it; but I guess people are just too worried about spoilers. What is there to spoil? The game is a different one every time you go to New Game. Just suck it up!  Of course there are some people who think I'm being a f***ing idiot and don't know what I'm talking about, which is why I'm not getting a lot of support and why some would want to mark this review as funny. I support this game because it was a lot of work and dedication all done by one man. It took him nearly a decade to complete this game, and I'm in the starting stages of creating a game solo myself. If you discredit this game, you discredit the creator. I think there are just some people who don't appreciate the old-school genre of first person shooters, and I understand that there are a few bugs and glitches; but there really is no such thing as a game that is 100% flawless. Such a concept does not exist. For fifteen years, I have played hundreds of video games; and they are all made the way they are made.  Also, I argue about criticisms being nothing but competition because the total of reviews have been positive and then mixed, positive and then mixed, positive and then mixed, and so forth.  The one thing people should think about is the possibility of a sequel. After speaking with Shaun Williams last year, he said that there would be a CDF Ghostship 2 and 3 with Unreal Engine 4 if the sales are good. Whatever you all think he got wrong in this game, he could perfect in a future title.",

Able to re-assign keybinds -Great and is KEY to having pc gamers onboard .. you forget us we forget you (it's that simple) ..  Story line was kind of cool, and did give the air of being alone ..  Single players Should have manual save and load points, (it's our hard drive space) why not here?  Over all very good, 'ghostship Aftermath' NOT so good .. aftermath is a wasted of (parden the pun) Space ..  ",
