            "review_text": "This game is pretty nice. It will remind you of a lot of old classic shooters such as Megaman as well as Contra. Think Megaman in western setting. The game itself is pretty short takes around one and a half hour to beat in normal mode. There's boss fights every 5 rounds and total of 4 bosses. 20 stages and they're not that long. Everytime you die you start at the beginning of the stage.   Graphics - This sort of has a design which looks like hand drawn (not sure if it actually is). The game looks beautiful in my opinion and the art style suits it as well. The few number of colors used really make the artstye unique and looks very cool imo.   Music/Sound - This game has VERY nice music, when i say nice i mean i have literally taken the .ogg files from the games directory and put in on my phone to listen to. I was addicted to the soundtrack.  Gameplay - Fun gameplay which can be challenging. All you do is go through the stage and kill the cowboys, ducks(lol?), aliens with your handy pistol. There's some frustrating platforming as well. You can also get upgrades to your gun (think contra), there's a 3 way spread, a bigger buller which is slower but does more damage, there's even laser gun as well as a heat seeking gun. You have a life bar which lets you take around 4-5 hits before you die. Every 5 levels you get a boss fight which are pretty interesting and require you to learn their patterns to kill them.  Overall i'd recomend this game, $2, seriously you can't even get soda for that now a days.",

            "review_text": "Gunman Clive is an interesting platformer disguised as a wild west shooter. There's some shooting involved but mostly it's just running and jumping through short levels (about 1-2 minutes long if you do it perfectly) with a boss battle after about 5 levels or so. I think that there are about 20 levels (about 1 hour of playtime), but my memory is so terrible I can't even remember.  I love the art style, it's nothing short of amazing, if only a little colorless.   In all honesty, I was hoping for game like the brilliant Sunset Riders (look it up !), but this will do nicely I guess. But if you want a true wild west shooter stick with the superb Call Of Juarez Gunslinger.  Since it's only a few bucks you can't really go wrong with this game. But remember that it's a platformer, not necessarily a shooter.  [Rating: 70/100]",

While the game itself isn't exactly difficult, the real challenge in the game will come from trying to get star ratings and no damage bonuses on every stage, especially in Duck Mode (the pacifist-esque mode of this game with some amusing mechanics playing as a duck). If you're looking for something cheap, short, yet fun to play, then its definitely worth chucking a couple bucks Gunman Clive's way.",

It's very Mega Man in the Old West, and it's awesome. It's actually difficult, but for the most part all deaths are fair and if you die, it's your fault. For $2, this game is an absolute steal. I've already gotten hours of entertainment from it on the 3DS and this version plays just like the 3DS version, just at a higher frame rate and resolution. Seriously, buy this game. You will not regret it.",

Playing as a duck and not being able to eliminate the enemies completely changes the dynamics of the levels. Yes, the levels are the same. The gameplay differs a lot though, when playing as the duck. ^^",

            "review_text": "Basically, Gunman Clive is what happens when an author decides he's going to make a solid, oldschool platformer (just like, say, Mega Man 5) and yet somewhere along the way gets confused, forgets what he's doing, and just actually makes Mega Man 5.  This is both the highest praise and harshest criticism anyone can really bring against this title- it's 99% derivative, and 1% sepia-toned cowboys. Despite its looks, every gameplay element present is lifted directly from oldschool platformers, and anyone who's ever held a game controller ought to know exactly where those disappearing blocks, one-hit-kill spikes, and inexplicably missing sections of mine cart track came from. Among them all, Mega Man 5 seems to have been borrowed from most liberally, with shoutouts to Charge Man, Star Man, and Gravity Man's famous levels, nevermind the fact that Clive himself handles exactly like the original Blue Bomber himself (with his pre-90's control scheme, specifically).  Like similar indie title Bleed, Gunman Clive is a love letter to these games of yore, and to its credit, it executes the mechanics pretty perfectly, remixing incredibly familiar elements in comparatively new and challenging arrangements. Furthermore, the skin stretched over these old cogs is a surprisingly pleasant one. While embracing minimalism is hardly a new trend for these retro-style indie games, Gunman Clive actually does it gracefully, foregoing rehashed 8-bit-style graphics for something more contemporary- specifically, a combination of 3D models and artful shading for a simplistic, sepia-toned storybook visuals. The similarly minimalist story of silent-protagonist-saves-the-girl is at best unintrustive, yet still manages to be charming, if only for the sheer ridiculousness it quickly devolves into. Adding further charm is the story's feminist-friendly inversion, where Clive himself plays the hapless damsel while the armed and ever-capable Ms. Johnson takes it to the bad guys with her own victorian style.   Disappointingly, despite drawing most of its appeal from his ability to emulate classic platforming adventures, Gunman Clive doesn't necessarily attempt to surpass them. While the Mega Man series famously featured selectable levels and a generous handful of bosses, Gunman Clive is content to remain linear and dishes out only a precious few boss encounters, not a one of whom will be bestowing their signature weapon upon defeat. There's a justification for this lack of ambition, however, and the proof is in the price tag. The asking price for Gunman Clive is two dollars, which might be less than you've ever paid for a video game that wasn't 90% in a Steam Sale.  For its asking price, you'd be doing yourself a favor to give Clive a fair shot, especially if you've got any love for oldschool video games. It's all too short, but every bit as sweet.  Plus, ducks.",

            "review_text": "This is a short but enjoyable Mega Man-esque platformer with some humor and a little bit of variety. The hybrid 3D/drawn style is well done, along with the Old West styled music. Some levels and bosses can be hard until you learn their patterns, but the game is forgiving with infinite lives and saving. Three different characters are available along with legit achievements.",

            "review_text": "This was a short, sweet platformer. It really gave me a Mega Man vibe with how some of the stags were set up along with it's soundtrack. This game isn't exactly going to win any awards for revolutionizing the genre, but for the price, it was really worth it for me. If you go into this game like you spend $15 or $20 on it you're probably going to be disappointed.   There are around 5 different weapon power-ups to use throughout the game, though you lose the upgrade the moment you take damage. All the stages take around 45 - 90 seconds to beat without dying with boss fights taking place after 4 stages I believe. Dying on a stage takes you all the way back to the beginning. It's really not as frustrating as people make it out to be. Like I said before, the stages take no time to be. The game allows you to play as three different characters and after beating the games the achievements will keep you going for a few hours more if you're really into the game.   If you're looking for a quick nostalgia fix then this game might be right up your ally. Definitely pick it up on discount or in a bundle if you think it's too much now.",

There are variations of powerup guns you can pick up, but you lose them as soon as you get hit once. It looks deceivingly easy if you watch the videos, but don't let the simplicity fool you. There are various types of levels to mix up the gameplay a bit. The game also rewards players for not receiving any damage, or making a speed run, which should appeal to the real hardcore crowd. This game is definitely for the fans of the old school and new gamers alike.",
