The free version only lets you play in the Garage-room on a barbox (small)table 6 or 9ball or 8 ball us-rules, its alot of fun.  But, if you want to be able to play every game available, I recommend buying the Full VP4 game because you'll be able to play offline as well, great for practice! It includes 1 year full online play.    ",
