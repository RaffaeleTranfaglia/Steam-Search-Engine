There is barely any game here cause all you do is just click certain things, and the mini-games are ♥♥♥♥ poor and boring as hell!!!

            "review_text": "You're better off waiting for Valve's Summer Sale game, than playing Ductape Studio's Summer Sale game. In Valve's Summer Sale game, most of the minigames are a lot more fun and entertaining as they vary from a variety of genres, and have a lot of great storylines, gameplay mechanics, and much more. Ductape Studio's Summer Sale game is mostly joke simulator minigames with terrible gameplay and missable achievements. The options menu in Valve's Summer Sale game is a lot simpler as it only changes the important parts of the game like graphics, button mapping, etc. whereas Ductape Studio's Summer Sale game literally has too many unnecessary options like changing the text, coin color, and other weird changes. The only thing that is good about Ductape Studio's Summer Sale game is that you don't need a high end PC to play the minigames, Valve's Summer Sale game varies on system requirements and may require a top notch computer to run the minigames properly. The emoticons and profile backgrounds on Ductape Studio's Summer Sale game is a lot better than Valve's Summer Sale game because it pretty much expresses the whole sale in general whereas Valve's Summer Sale game is mostly theme based. Overall though, you shouldn't buy this game if you focus more on the gameplay, unless you want another steam badge then go for it.  Rating: 1/100 It belongs in the trash",

And its really funny, like you buy games in a game and you can play very funny games such as, 'Freind zone sim' and 'summer sale'...yes you can play this game in the game, lol. but itd kinda boring becuase most of the games suck, but its also very easy to get achivements, so it is an okay game but mostly funny, but also kinda borning :D",
