            "review_text": "Where to start.... I wanted to love Cargo 3, it had a price tag that agreed with me 4.99, was a FPS sci fi horror game and generally looks like something I would love. After downloading the game I was stoked to play it.   After the first minute of playing I had already come to regret my decision. The movements are sluggish and kind of unresponsive. You randomly take damage for no known reason, looking in all directions I saw nothing that should have damaged me but none the less I was damaged anyway.  The hit detection also seemed to suffer from the same unresponsiveness that the controls did. Pressing the fire button would cause my weapons to fire 3 to 5 seconds after I pressed the actual button. Which allowed the creatures to start attacking me. Point blank shots seemed to have no effect on these creatures at all..  Eventually I found my way to the first level's end... I think? I was greeted with a loading screen... upon reloading, I was devoid of my weapons. After wandering for a few moments I was attacked and killed as I had no weapons to defend myself (this was a bug, when I reloaded the checkpoint my gun was back) After wandering a little while longer I was killed while my point blank bullets cruised through the creature right in front of me.  I think this game could be good, if the movements and hit detection were fixed, while it certainly won't win any game of the year awards for the low price of 4.99 with some fixes it could be worth a few hours of game time.",

            "review_text": "unsettling but only because you're afraid the controls/camera will bug out when a baddie finds you. need more stabilization, experienced framerate fluctuations from 38 to 150 and back as well as anywhere in between. also needs a whole lot of balance. you get a mini gun in the first 3 seconds of starting. who just leaves miniguns lying around a cargo ship? also the viewmodes don't really do anything, night vision just changed the filter to a grainy green, rage to a fluorescent red, and shadow to gray. maybe thats the whole point: cosmetic.   anyway it needs a whole lot more work before i would recommend to anyone. not that my opinion matters that much anyway.",
