The strength challenge doesn't really work which makes sense as you aren't actually making contact with the dummy.   If Thrill of the Fight adds heavy bag and speed bag training this will be obsolete. Until then this is an ok option for a quick workout with a virtual heavy bag. Heck it was under 7 bucks I think it's worth that.",
