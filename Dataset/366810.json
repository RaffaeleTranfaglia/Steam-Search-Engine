            "review_text": "Hi there, on start I would like to say I am older player. I have played similar games like DM1, DM2, Eye of Beholder, Lands of Lore, Stonekeep, Legend of Grimrock etc. so I have few games to compare to.  Generally the gameplay, design, atmosphere is quite nice and I hope this game will develop further and end as something to be remembered, but there is still long way to go.  Here are my suggestions, I guess and hope majority of it is well known to you and will be done(there might be something that is there but I haven't yet encountered it as I have the heroes around level 7):    First of all, do not make the gamers press the W key to move forward so damn often.  This key is stressed enough.     Sound and music volume control is a must have.    Key binding for spells, potions, attack. I suppose it is designed for tablets also, but why to skip PC users.    More types of equipment. Give equipment some more stats, abilities. You know what I am talking about.    Give weapons special attacks - for example dagger from left to right for 50 percent for open wound. Blunt weapons from bottom to top for chance to knock back the enemy. Swords could have a chanceto disarm the enemy for some time etc.    The monsters are nice, but I am lacking the skills like throwing, spell casting, poisoning, paralyzing one hand, special announced strong attacks, resistances etc.    To change the play style the ranger could be faster to avoid the spells, arrows, the mage could have spells for that - shield, counter spell, and the warrior bonus to shields as magic resist for example.    I read about the boss at the end of dungeon - great idea. Do not make the game too easy. No one will remember it, enjoy it and play it long enough.    And last but not least. If you insist on the farming of gems(if not buying them for real money which seems in this phase of the game a little over the top), make it better. The random dungeons are too simple.   After writing the things that bothers me and I would like to see improved, it seems hard to recommend the game, but I would like to see the future of this game. You have my recommendation.",
