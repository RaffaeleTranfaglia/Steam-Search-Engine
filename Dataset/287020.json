            "review_text": "Pretty much the best work of satire in gaming...  Without the context of the twist (And the creators message to 'Video Games make people killers' political types and Politically Correct Censor types) this game seems like a total mess, Bad acting, strange music choices, seemingly random dialog and shock violence...  But with the context, I wont get into spoilers, the strange sci-fi music, the juxtaposition of 50's 'Age of Innocence' with extreme violence and evil, symbolism (Meat especially), over the top gore, bizzare sexuality and social message all make perfect sense, and are quite brilliant.  The combat is still pretty much garbage, but the writing and direction is top notch once you understand the intent.",

            "review_text": "Harvester is a point and click horror/adventure game from the 90s. What sets it apart from other games in its genre is how insane it is. This game has things in it that would not stand a chance at making it into releases today. Sure, blood and gore are pretty common today, but when it involves children, it's just completely taboo now. Not surprisingly, Harvester has a pretty decent sized cult following. It was hit hard when it was released by negative criticism for its gameplay but mostly for its content. It definitely broke no ground with its gameplay and its content is pretty shocking. I found the tone of the game to be just perfect. It is just creepy beyond reason. Kind of like a cheesy horror flick or something. The characters are so over the top with their insanity it almost makes you feel uncomfortable. The game has humor, but the humor is also...insane. I really love it. Check it out. It's cheap and worth the ride.",

            "review_text": "I remember the FMV genre being an odd novelty in the video game industry which was both amazing and annoying at the same time. Seeing live actors fully interacting within a digital world was fascinating. Unfortunately, the concept was poorly implemented--resulting in all frills and no thrills gameplay. Corpse Killer immediately comes to mind; what a horrible game. Point-and-click adventure seemed best suited for this particular class, and Harvester is a fine example of that. I'm surprised at the level of violence in this game and how it managed to sneak under the radar of sensitive noses.  FMV may be dead, and will probably never return; but I salute the hardwork by programmers to preserve these lost artifacts for future generations.",

            "review_text": "Harvester is a sometimes uncomfortable mix of oddly done social commentary, and a collection of sometimes awful ironic funny moments delievered in the style of an odd D-List FMV game.  You play as Steve, the Plaid shirt wearing kidder of Harvester. You wonder around Harvester, trying to remember what's what as you suffer from amnesia all of a sudden. Harvester is from the odd age of PC games, or at least right at the end of it. The game is a point 'n' click, complete with odd plots, pixel hunting, and sometimes hilariously woeful animations, visualisations and 'great' voice acting. The game tries to mix things up near the end, with very mixed results, with some sections coming off as boring or weak compared to the rest of the game.  The quirk, is that nothing is ordinary. People are obsessed with anything, be it corpses, meat, wasps, or whatever else. FMV cutscenes tell the story hilariously. As mentioned before, the voice acting and ridiculous writing that would ruin any other game gives Harvester an excellent personality. Be it staring at Spinal Cords and thinking about pie, or be it becoming somewhat genuinely disturbing, Harvester's plot is memorable because of its plot is its greatest quirk.  Visually, it’s an FMV game, and you can tell by looking at it that it's an FMV. The characters feature quite a bit of animation considering this. Unfortunately, dialogue is not animated, but it is fully voiced by Harvester's all-star cast, which although all sound really odd, perfectly portray the screwed up world that Steve inhabits. The environments are extremely weird, and the cutscenes featuring full-motion video are extremely strange.  The soundtrack is very varied, featuring a variety of different music. Although it sometimes seems unsuitable, once again because of the weirdness this game strives in, I can't tell if this is intentional, or if it’s just really shoddy design.  Overall, there isn't much you can say about Harvester. Harvester is just a bloody weird game, and because Harvester is so weird, I have to recommend this to as many people as possible. The game is just weird, and deserves some attention now, being a breath of fresh air in the modern day of serious, competitive gaming. Although the game gets weaker near the end, there is plenty of meat here to keep you entertained, despite its stupidity.",

I'd compare the game to Deadly Premonition, the gameplay itself ain't very fun but this is the kind of game you play for the story and the characters. All the characters are so strange and interesting, everyone seems to have their own weird lil personality trait to them. The town itself, 'Harvest' is also so strange, whilst playing the game you'll get the feeling of being trapped in the town, it can be pretty immersive for such a dated looking game. Id just recommend checking it out, especially if you're into adventure games or horror games.",

Harvester is so delightfully terrible that you are never short on material to laugh at. It is the epitome of the horrible 90s FMV craze. It's very short, but you will need at least one case of beer for this game (likely more) as it has no redeemable artistic qualities.   I have to imagine that Harvester lives on in gaming solely for our personal amusement and who the heck couldn't be amused by the so-called 'acting' and vapid storyline in this horrid s^$t-fest? Seriously, most of this game is so bad that it's comically pleasant. I thoroughly enjoyed laughing until I cried and having to drink all that beer to tough this abortion out certainly didn't tick me off either.  7/10, will get plastered and play again.",

Every weapon has a different range and firing speed, but it always winds up being a speed-click contest regardless; you can also aim upward, middle, or downward but this seems to be pointless. It's a shame, because this game was delayed two years for the programming alone, which seems to have done more harm to the project than good.  In short, this game didn't get the budget it deserved. The good news is, it's only the second half where the bugs become apparent and only in certain places. The game is still awesome and replayable.

Don't get me wrong it's still fun and the puzzles are challenging as per your usual adventure game fare but it seems to be a teenage trouser mousers wet dream rather than a serious game, over the top violence, implied sexual innuendo, eventually the game just gives up all pretense and just goes full on with enemies being BDSM whip wielding women.  Interesting narrative though but I'm not sure if it is a deliberate satire on video game violence etc or just woefully missing the point.  Also I managed to miss the entire last act worth of puzzles because I simply lost my patience with the game and killed my way to the end... I suppose that could work in its favour.  I enjoyed it...
