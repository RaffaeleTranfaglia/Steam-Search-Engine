            "review_text": "Your friend Albea passed away recently and her husband, Grendel, asks you to come to him. He reveals that he's haunted by her ghost. However, Grendel is killed mysteriously while you were seeing Albea's ghost. You're arrested by the police and escaped custody. It's time to investigate the mystery around Grendel and Albea.  I never completed the game before because of a big problem that I will explain later. However, I wanted to review it, so I replayed it and I can say that the plot is interesting. Them - The Summoning is the first chapter of a more complex story - I didn't check if it was the only game or if there are more. Anyway, there are several twists in the story.  The gameplay is purely an hidden object game, with an inventory to complete items or to find others. In other words, you will be given a list of items to find. Some of them are hidden in drawers but they're not signaled. And if you want to unlock the extras, you have to find 10 bonus objects. You don't know what they are, in other words, click randomly to find them. And to top that, the items are very very small or sometimes, you're asking yourself if it was really visible. If you play in Standard, you don't have any chance to have an hint. In Easy, at least, after some minutes, it's blinking or being shown. And the HUD is also on hidden objects by moments. You're not really enjoying the hidden objects scenes. The puzzles are just anecdotic.  The graphics are acceptable, however, the HUD isn't making justice to the them and is completely impersonal. The drawings in the custscenes are also very good. The soundtrack is also good. But it's not really enough. When you see the menu, the old school buttons don't give you any envy.  In other words, Them - The Summoning isn't that bad. However, I didn't really enjoy the hidden objects scenes. I'm convinced by the story but as it's disserved by many problems... My conclusion is that Them - The Summoning cannot be recommended unless you're an hardcore hidden object gamer.",

            "review_text": "This title is only chapter 1 of a 3 part story. The story is mildly interesting, however unless you know saints and bishops by sight you cannot pass the game without using hints constantly or just randomly clicking dudes in robes. The art work is decent but some of the items do not look like the description...so you must use the hint button again and again. A construction helmet looked like a school notebook with a metal circle taped to it. Overall I just kept clicking until it ended but I wasn't really having fun.",
