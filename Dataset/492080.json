I loved the fact that the story takes place in Iceland, a colleague of mine went there once and said that it was an amazing country. I really wanted this VN to be a bit longer, just when I started to get more into the story, it was over. Hopefully, the upcoming side story will explain more about Gryla.   6/10.",
