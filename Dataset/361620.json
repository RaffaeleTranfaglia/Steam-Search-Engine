GREAT means of preparing the player, a wonderful learning curve for something that gives the impression of substantial complexity further on. Considering the first 12 levels or so, I feel comfortable regardless of what is coming.  The comments and messages generated by the game are amusing &amp; entertaining. The images the player creates are fun and interesting. I may not be intelligent enough to complete this game, but it has a way of making me FEEL smart. (I wish this DEV had been around when I was trying to learn AutoCad 20 years ago.)  Thanks for that.  This is genuinely unlike anything else on Steam, and that may well be reason enough to get it.",
