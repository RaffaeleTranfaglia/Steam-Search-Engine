            "review_text": "I love this game. The Single player is a blast! I feel it reminds me of total war except much more simplifed and obviously in a different universe with tanks, aircraft and infantry!   The Single player USA campaign is awesome! Going from battlefield to battlefield conquering the airbases, fuel depots, radar stations and defending them is fun.   The unit variety is quit nice also that makes the game more interesting- MBT-70, Abrams, M60, all sorts of anti-tank missile vehicles, its just awesome to see how they work, have proper armor values and realstic armor system on all the vehicles.   Its 5 dollars! A great deal for a game you will get 20-40 hours of out in just one campaign!   Great game, I wish the multiplayer had co-op campaign and the multiplayer to be functional as doing it over virtual netowrking is pretty laggy and boring.   The graphics are also not fantastic, but if you have played blitzkreg or honestly don't care, it works for anyone.   Great game for any RTS/RTT gamer!",
