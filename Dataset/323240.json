            "review_text": "Pros : - Low Cost - Character Models and Sounds are cool enough - Enjoyable in short bursts - Difficulty is tweaked alright  Cons : - Repetitive use of boss concepts and models (same half dozen with slifht tweaks over and over) - Few cooldown abilities are only effective if you can orient your character in the right angle - weak controls -  - The short burts gameplay model works much better on a tablet when you dont have acess to your pc gaming rig - Fights against other human characters are a messy brawl where you mostly fire around blindly  Conclusion : For the cost - and what it offers - its a fair bargain. However the PC is really the wrong platform for this game and you will very quickly yearn for more depth in your gameplay, a story, some better sense of progression, and this game is not the one to deliver it. Still might be worth adding to your library if you get it in a bundle or for very cheap for a quick relief of your hack and slash itch ",

I played the crap out of it on my Iphone 5, and I'll do the same thing on my PC too. Just remember all of you, this is not the final version nor a full functioning game, so don't go full ♥♥♥♥♥♥ on it being not updated etc.  All in all, I say this game has loads of potential and I'll be more than happy to wait for it!!.",
