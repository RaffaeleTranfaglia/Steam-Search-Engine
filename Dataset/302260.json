            "review_text": "As you've probably noticed by the Title &amp; screenshots, Truffle Saga is a puzzle game for kids.   You are a red &amp; yellow squirrel...... or dog .... or fox.... I'm not sure what the creature is suppose to be, but my guess would be a squirrel because you have to throw nuts down the trees. Your goal is to aim and try to hit all the yellow mushrooms in one throw. This could be accomplished by aiming the right way and the nut has to bounce off leaves to hit them all. There are different kinds of plants or insects that help you in your mission like piranha plants or bees. Obviously after a while the puzzles get harder and you will have to be more creative. You could see this game as a reversed 'Peggle' (the game).  I would only recommend this game for kids but even then Peggle would be a better choice for you.",
