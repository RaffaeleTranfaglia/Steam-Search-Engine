            "review_text": "First of all, the voice acting does an amazing job to give the game more life. Unlike other Sakura Games (those I have on my list) there are no voice acting and that makes the game a lot more fun, hopefully they continue with that in the future!  And the choices you have to make in some areas gives you somewhat different outcome, though I wish there was more areas you could actually choose different daiologs in. It's pretty lacking but it's still fun.  And who doesn't like Achievements and Steam trading Cards huh?!  More story in this than I imagined, pretty cliché though but it does the job and sometimes cliché is just fun, relaxing. And speaking of relaxing..   Would fap again 10/10!",
