            "review_text": "This game really does surprise you. It comes off as 'portal, but in 2D, and minus the sense of humor.' And well, it kind of is, but it does so much more. The puzzles get progressively harder and more complex as you get different guns, and the last sequence of puzzles before the end is kind of just completely brain-melting. There's a surprisingly high execution factor in some cases, as well. And this is only the normal difficulty. I've not played the game's 'hard' mode but I doubt I'd be able to complete it if I did. The graphics are kind of ugly though, all things considered, but that's a minor knock against it.",

            "review_text": "Did you ever think to yourself 'Man, Portal is too easy. I wish Valve's playtesters hadn't weeded out the 5 emancipation grid room, or thrown up when walking on the ceiling'? Well, you're in luck.  This game is, from my vague knowledge of Metroid, a hybrid of Portal and Metroid. You are a scientist, stuck in his lab, with all the areas therin sealed off by devious puzzles only solvable by your gateway (Portal) devices. Yes, devices. You get the basic one early on, but then you find yourself needing to rotate gravity, and link time AND space, and make yourself small (or large, but I managed to Portal all the large situations) through the same device. As you get more unlocks, you can explore more of the map, and open up harder puzzles.  This doesn't have GLaDOS, but the cruel puzzles make up for it (you can buy automated solutions for just 25 hint orbs, but generally the 5 orb 'Is this possible yet?' question is more entertaining).  If you want a very much easier platformer with the same time mechanics as here you can check out Shuggy by the same dev. But it is very very easy, and I'd only recommend it to kids. Seasoned platformers are going to find that the only challenge here is trying to complete two player co-op with one character on each hand.",

            "review_text": "Gateways has a decent concept, sort of in the vein of those Portalesque games that followed in it's wake, but a reasonably decent game.  Although, unfortunately, I wasn't able to finish the game. The puzzle design has some of the most difficult puzzles in the game being mandatory to complete, which wouldn't be a problem normally. But, the mechanic you unlock near the end of the game that enables these puzzles involves a lot of key timing and platforming that ended up being far too twitchy for me to finish.  Ultimately, because I have no 'maybe' option, I have to vote No on Gateways because of this. Perhaps if they had structured the game a little differently I could recommend it. But sadly, if any of what I mentioned seems like a red flag for you, I'd look elsewhere.",

            "review_text": "Gateways initially seems like an 8-bit Portal platformer, but it grows to be so much more.  The story sorrounds a professor who has been trapped in his lab. He explores it, and in doing so recovers parts of his equipment, which lets him progress further. The initial gun fires simple point-to-point gateways, like Portal. But as more guns are unlocked, the game becomes more and more challenging and interesting, with Time travel gates, gravity reversal gates and so on.  The game doesn't take very long to complete, and I was able to solve the game first time without using any of the hints, but it still proves to be challenging enough in certain areas.  This game can be controlled by a controller, but I would reccomend against this, as using analog sticks it can be hard to accurately place the gates. Keyboard and mouse work much better.  The 8-bit graphics in this game are very nice. The map never looks particularly 'static' in any way, with minor details   The music in this game is very nice. It's never too obtrusive and loud, and definitely adds to the atmosphere of the game.  There is a level editor (library&gt;tools), and workshop integration so you can create and share your own maps. The level editor is easy to get a hang of, and the developers included an extra map which is available on the workshop.  I found no bugs while playing this game, and it never crashed on me. My only complaints are that the save points are a bit sparse, though. So if you die, you might have a long way to travel to get back.  Overall this is a great little platformer puzzle game, it's a bit short, but definitely worth playing.",

The puzzles are by and large very clever, and well-designed.  My main issue with this game is that the controls are not very responsive at all. This doesn't pose a huge problem until the very last puzzle, which requires so many past echoes that if you mess up a jump you lose a lot of time.  Overall, I'd say it's a very good puzzle game. It's just long enough, I'd say, and well worth 5 bux.",
