            "review_text": "Don't let the cute graphics fool you, his is a challenging game. At first I didn't like it because it. In most tower defense games you can figure out a pattern and keep applying that strategy as you go. This game you have to reinvent your strategy every new course. Sometimes you can only place one block, sometimes you can create elaborate mazes. New enemies are introduced on most courses which make you winning method obsolete. You get frustrated, yell at it but then eventually/hopefully come up with a way to win.   I wish the developers would allow you to move the map with the keyboard. Having to hold down the left mouse button and move the map while trying to place weapons in a game can be unnecessarily frustrating. Also it would be nice to know when you upgrade a weapon what actual percentage more damage it does. Lots of guess work is needed. ",

            "review_text": "There's an element of randomness to any tower defense game, but this one is...well, it's remarkably inconsistent. Most of the towers have a firing arc and a set rotation speed, but the AI on the towers loves to point them in the least helpful direction. If you fail a wave, restarting it and changing nothing about your tower placements and upgrades is just as likely to bring a win as reworking everyhing that you previously tried.  The game isn't outright bad, but it's meant to kill time as it's nothing more than a port of a smartphone game.   ",
