            "review_text": "Faron's Fate is a decent rogue-like game very similar gameplay and mechanics wise to Binding of Isaac with a more melee orientated fantasy skin (it even has some recognisable enemies and items). It took me 10 runs to finish in a time of 24 minutes, with roughly half the items collected.  If the dev updated with acheivements to mark your exploits and maybe some collectable steam cards to show your support then this game would be a perfect purchase for the price.",
