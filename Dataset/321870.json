            "review_text": "Silence Of The Sleep is a psychological horror adventure game that has you playing as a man named Jacob. After committing suicide you end up in some sort of dream, at least, that is what it seems like at first. But this dream is quickly turning into some kind of nightmare…  The game starts with you throwing yourself off of a cliff. After that you wake up in a motel and after exploring for a bit and eventually solving the first puzzle you make your way downstairs. More puzzles wait you there, but there will also be different kinds of freakishly large and deadly creatures roaming around from then on. You’ll also meet different people along the way, and one of them is known as The Bartender. He’ll help and guide you through the levels, but he may not be who you think he is. On the other hand, he’s the only guy you can trust and rely on in your ordeal. Your goal is to eventually find out what you’re doing there, and why. You’ll play through several chapters in order to find out the exact reasons. Silence Of The Sleep is a horror game but not one with tons of jump scares. There are some creepy and disturbing scenes in it but it won’t ever get too scary. This might have to do with the 2D viewpoint instead of the first person viewpoints most horror games use these days. One thing’s for sure, though, and that is that it has nothing to do with the atmosphere, which is just amazing. In fact, its mysterious nature reminded me of some of David Lynch’s movies, to be more specific here: Lost Highway. The gameplay is relatively simple, as long as you’re familiar with point-and-click adventures (lots of puzzle solving and looking for clues and solutions), but the controls could definitely use some work here. Your character can move into four directions, even if the game is shown from a 2D perspective. You can (obviously) move to the left and right, but you can also move up and down. Pressing E will allow you to perform an action. But instead of just facing a direction while standing in front of a door you’ll have to face your character specifically towards the door. This makes for tense situations when a creature is chasing you, of course, but it also feels really clumsy and requires more input than I think is necessary. The game uses an interface that is hardly noticeable, which is just great for immersion. By pressing the Spacebar you can pop up your inventory and by letting it go you can use the item that you have currently selected. Works great and I wouldn’t want to see it another way. The puzzles require a lot of walking in search of items and clues. If you’re not putting together items, you usually have to remember or find some numbers to eventually get inside something. Sometimes these numbers are hidden in clues, and other times you have to use your faithful flashlight. But the puzzles are never too easy and they’re made to motivate investigations. Saving is done by finding gramophone players. So there’s no way to save wherever and whenever you want, and there’s no autosave. The gramophone player option works well, but they’re usually hard to see. I missed it completely when I entered the recreation area/bar/lobby and had to restart entirely from where I first took the elevator after being almost done on that floor. Now I first scout for gramophone players before doing anything else so it’s a lesson well learned I guess. But still something that could be a little clearer. Not everyone will notice them immediately. Same goes for some of the items you have to look for; they're integrated into the backgrounds a little too well sometimes.  As I said, the atmosphere is amazing. The graphics (in this case I specifically mean the environments) have tons of detail in them and the character silhouettes are created and animated very nicely. Some of them could benefit from some extra frames, but it’s nothing distracting and I can’t believe this entire game was created by just one person. Just for that this game (and its developer) deserves your respect. I did miss some visual options, however; you can only stretch the graphics (full screen) or view it in its original state, which is still full screen but smaller and centered and with black bars on the sides. The last option gives the sharpest graphics, but that should go without saying. I found the music to be subtle (until an enemy notices you) and the others sounds (thankfully) less subtle. Enemies make crazy, disturbing noises and objects like fireplaces make correct, realistic sounds. Music and sound play a big part in horror games and in that aspect Silence Of The Sleep did not disappoint.  The game has 5 chapters and finishing it should take you somewhere between 8 and 10 hours, depending on how much trouble you have solving the puzzles and finding the required items. Chapter 3 is a little slow which also makes the game feel longer and even a little boring but since it's all part of the story I can't really fault it for anything. In any case, it's a pretty long game for a horror/adventure game, especially considering the price Jesse's asking for it.  Silence Of The Sleep is a brilliant little game and one that I would gladly recommend to all horror, mystery and point-and-click adventure gamers. Not just because it was made singlehandedly by just one person but mainly because it’s just a great game with an amazing atmosphere and with tense encounters. Well worth the time and money, bravo !  [Rating: 85/100]",

            "review_text": "I hate giving this game a thumbs down, since it is clear that it's heart is at the right place, and the premise, graphics and gameplay bare more than a passing resemblance to one of the greatest pc horror games of the last decade - 'The cat lady', but after a promising start the game takes a head-first plunge. 'Silence of the sleep' is an adventure game at it's core, and no matter how many 'spooky' instant-death inducing fog monsters you throw at the player, you can't change the fact that the core gameplay is all about solving puzzles. Sure, instant death is no stranger to adventure games, but you know who else is no stranger to them? game saving.  Yes. This game commits the most atrocious sin commitable in an adventure game - sparse save points and instant deaths. You see, this mechanic, which works well in action oriented survival horror games is perfectly plausible, but not in an adventure game. It's a terrible decision to force the players to solve puzzles they already solved just because they ran into a fog monster and died. Solving puzzles is a one time affair, it's fun when you figure it out, tedious when you have to do it a second time, and game-deletion reason when you are forced to do it a third time. There's no logical way to explain this poor game design choice, other than trying to artificially prolong the experience, because unlike action oriented games, where encoutering enemies again and again raises the player's skill level, here it just raises their furiosity level. I'm sorry, but unless the developer somehow decides to add a save button, I can't recommend it at all.",

            "review_text": "Please... Forgive me.  These are the opening words of the protagonist (or unorthodox anti-hero) Jacob B. Reeves as he stands in front of the choice whether to plummet into the abyss beneath or not, with the choice already chosen for you.   Graphics/art style - 10/10  During that short scene and every subsequent scene thereafter, you'll notice a unique style to the game, artisticly for one, that immediatly catches your eye. Jacob has a face when dialog is presented, but at all other times, he is a pitch black silhouette shape of a man, which begs for interpretation throughout the entire game. Beatifully crafted envoirnments and characters (monsters, eeeeh) separates this game from alot of others titles flooding the marked.   Gameplay - 8/10  Moving through the, presumably, personal hell of Jacobs own making, alot of things are thrown at you and sometimes, mostly, thinking on your feet (fingers?) will get you through it. Some things take trial and error until you go 'Aaaah, DOH!' and then there's the frustration inducing 'DOH! AAAARH!' Then there are some puzzles/actions required, that gives no explanation when it is most needed. The first 4-5 instructions are short, informative and precise but it kind of falters after that. Spending 20 minutes rotating a bobby pin lockpick, having no clue what cues to go after, walking around a cottage for just below 1 hour confused because I decided to take a break, return to the game and having NO idea what to do, so a little (Hate myself for suggesting it) 'objective' reminder would have been alot of help and basic instructions in some places.  Soundtrack 7/10  I love a good soundtrack, but trying to remember some of the music, I honestly draw a blank. I remember thinking 'Stellar soundtrack!' during different points of the game, but games like Bastion, Hotline Miami, Super Meat Boy are lightyears ahead of tailoring music to the game, but that is okay! Making a memorable OST would be a nightmare for the general person, me especially, because where would you start?! So considering what limitations there is, the OST for Silence of the Sleep is good as it is experienced ingame.   Overall - 9/10   Jesse Makonnen -the games creator- and all who helped him out in his 1½ year stretch to finish this game did a FANTASTIC job! With an ending that draws from suprising parts of your journey, to disturbing SUDDEN moments that make you wretch, this is a game every fan of a good story and horror should not miss, especially with a 15$ / 15€ pricetag for hours of gameplay, despite a few pacing problems!   SITENOTE   ---The game bugged out in chapter 3, where it is suppose to initiate a cutscene. After specific dialog happens, you are put outside the room you were in without warning; deceptivly unlucky that is does so without hiccups, so when you were about to progress it brainfarted maximum and had me walking around for 2 hours before resetting and moving on ingame, just a heads up---",

            "review_text": "The Silence of Sleep, developed by Jesse Makkonen, puts you into the shoes of Jacob, a man who thought he just ended his own life, it's not really a spoiler to tell you this, as you will learn about this IMMEDIATELY as the game starts. The strange thing is he does not actually die but plunges into darkness. He will find himself with most of his memories gone, and a very tricky path in front of him to leave the place that he finds himself in.  Graphically this definitely gives that creepy vibe of anything could jump out at you. You will go through several different locations, and they will range from fancy to dilapidated. This is almost a side-scroller but does have the 3D space feel to it as doors will be in front, behind, and to the side of you. The monsters that creep around this game and will kill you with quick ease are very nightmarish. I did find it interesting that everyone is cast in silhouette in this game, but it works.  The sound is going to be used as another layer of the game. There are certain sounds that when you hear them you know you are in trouble, and you either need to run or hide. I do wish that this game was voiced, it definitely would have furthered the immersion into the game.  The controls are really straightforward. You are going to use the WASD combo to move, 'e' to interact, and 'f' for flashlight (which you can use the mouse to gain a little bit more precision on where the beam is aimed. I will tell you this though, if you use 'w' or 's' to face back or forward, you will need to press 'a' or 'd' before you can face forward or back, with the exception of left and right, there is no 180 turns.  Alright so lets get into the meat of the game. You are going to be put on a path that is really a point A to point B type of situation. You are going to be put to the test through each section of the game, and each section has its own wrinkles. There are going to be puzzles that you will have to solve in order to advance the game, and sometimes the answers are not the most straightforward thing. You may miss something small, and that will haunt you as you are combing over each section of the game to try to get a combination, or a solution.   This game has a lot of back and forth to it through each section as you try to advance the game, there's also layers of gameplay that keep getting added, which I don't know if I really liked. The first real example of this is that you will get to a certain part of the game, after you have already run into at least one nightmarish monster, where all of a sudden you are now able to see through a peephole or listen to the door to try to determine where the monster is so that you can hopefully get past it and not get killed by it. This left me wondering why not start off the game with this ability. Then a little bit later you all of a sudden have an ability to hide from the monsters. Now I'm all for adding layers of complexity to the game, but this just feels like the developer decided to come up with ideas and throw them in as they went, never thinking about previous sections.  This is a tough game, and there's going to be those moments of absolute frustration, but as long as you save, A LOT, by interacting with the record players you find, you might find a hidden gem here. Personally this game doesn't feel as polished as I think it could have been, but there's definitely something to the game that kept me coming back. The story was interesting, I wasn't a HUGE fan of the font being used for dialogue, actually that was not a good choice, but the font didn't bother me to the point where I wanted to stop playing.   This is actually one tough game to rate. There are parts of the game that I didn't like and then there were pieces of the game that I liked. It is a good game, but at the same time there are things that just don't rub me the right way. So I guess I'm going to have to say that this game gets a 6.9 out of 10.",

I say, it worth playing On the top of that: Ladies and gentleman, this one-man-made-game beats a lot AAA horror games with a simple trick: it is not only a jumpscare fest.

You will miss though several door that near impossible or completely impossible see and save points that are not impossible but so colorblemnded into teh background you will miss them several times over.  Two, there's a hiding mechanic that has two parts. The second being when you hide while being chased you have to complete a mini game to avoid being killed. That stupid mini game is the most impossible to complete piece of bad game design ever.   Three: No controller support. In this day and age is ignorant to not incluse controller support for a game.

The puzzles and Art direction are fine, but it is the monster chasing sequences that are boring , repetitive and not helped by the strange addition of a third dimension in a 2D side scrolling game which make the controls rather cumbersome. It is interesting to see comparisons being made with The Cat Lady; one of my favourite games. Silence of the Sleep does not have the same quality of writing, story line, darkness, or character empathy, and as Silence of the Sleep is a puzzle come 'hiding' game it is perhaps unfair to even make the comparisons.",
