            "review_text": "Having played Depth in Beta and followed the development for quite some time, I can happily say that this is one of the original titles of 2014, it is a game that is all about how you play and gamers who are big fans of survival, team play and horror should enjoy this title.  Divers: Being deep in murky open water (or tropic depending on level) you will have little idea where and when an attack might happen and unlike Primal Carnage, run (swim) and gun won’t save you in a sharks natural environment. This often leads to tense or outright hilarious situations depending on yours and you’re team8s ability to stay in control, the diver team might hunker down in a shipwreck, stewing mines, sonar’s and flairs everywhere to fight of an attack that doesn’t happen... yet as soon as they move between two wrecks or caves half the team could be pulled away and eaten before they get to safety, this often leads to a complete breakdown in team-play as getting into the next wreck alive is more important than covering you’re team and ohh boy are big open spaces scary in the deep...  Sharks: The initiative is in your corner, you choose how the game will play out and who will be eaten. With the array of evolution upgrades depending on how many divers you swallow you can either become faster, more intuitive or stronger. Going for the divers straight out of their Shark Cave or after they have been lulled into a false sense of security and just like the divers, team play can be essential between two sharks. Either by attacking at the same time from two different places (Smashing through a hull) or simply playing distraction while you’re fellow shark pulls out a diver whose team have their backs to him/her.  There are a surprising amount of counters and abilities in the game that really allow players to supplement each others, one diver might tag a shark with a harpoon, the other could catch him with a net thus leaving the two reaming divers to riddle him with darts while he tries to get out.  Or as shark, you might choose to take the hammerhead ability which allows you to disable the little robot that accompanies the divers (S.T.E.V.E) by ramming him in the open, this leaves the divers vulnerable between cover and in the deep. Which in turn can complete change the game as the desperately try to defend him they are snatched away one at the time in the best JAWS like fashion. ",

Missions simple the C*nt says dive in, get rich, pay cheap. He convinced me friends on steam to join aswell so we suit up and head top side whilst our boaI floats next to a off shore oil rig a blaze. Disregarding this ecological disaster we dive in looking to make 100 quid in the murky some how prisitne depths below. WHilst diving in a shark cage we are introduced to S.T.E.V.E. a Unmanned, Underwater, Vehicle . His mission is simple do eveything he could accomplish by himself only accompanied by a few blind swimmers getting paid minimum wage, who will ultimately lose everything earned topside. S.T.E.V.E. pisses off and we are ♥♥♥♥ deep chasing him through an underwater museum. Things could be worse I imagined whilst diving unil I hear a faint hert beat. I wiped me goggles as my fellow divers God, SmashT and Insaniac were laid to rest in a watery collage of blood and neoprene. A sonar system which costs my family food for a week seems to be the best way to ascertain what is happening. I place my beacon of hope and arm myself with an underwater side arm. S.T.E.V.E. with his fecks meter set to 0 keeps pecking away fully aware he would be fine in these waters with no assistance. I patiently wait until my beacon alarms a large creature several meters in length. Its general shape is of a white but I quickly learn all standrads have changed since 6 minutes prior to me jumping in the non oil ridden waters. The whites have learned everything beyond biological rule and have managed to reverse away from my beacon. Realizing these are no ordinary whites I attempt to warn my fellow swimmers who have been healed by poseidon himself strictly to finish our job of grabbing 40 quid's worth of crowns off the sea floor. My warning falls on deaf ears as I once again see the collage complimented by screaming bubbles. I brand forward in an attempt to follow S.T.E.V.E. at which point my legs are ripped from me and feed to the kelp.    16/10 Would swim again.",

            "review_text": "This one really caught me by surprise. When I heard of a game about sharks vs humans, I thought to myself “that sounds stupid… it’s just going to be a bad Left 4 Dead knockoff…”. Never have I been more happy to be more wrong in my entire life. Not only is this a well crafted first-person shooter. This is right up there with Nosgoth as one of the best asymmetrical shooters I’ve played.  Depth is a 4 vs 2 underwater shooter with a team of 4 divers taking on 2 shark players. The divers play in first-person, and the sharks play in third-person. The goal of the divers is to collect treasure from the ocean floor and give it to their robotic companion S.T.E.V.E., who is on the move quite often and prevents the divers from constantly camping in a single area. Collecting the treasure has the purpose of giving each diver cash in which they can purchase better weapons before they respawn, as you only start with a pistol at the beginning. Sharks, on the other hand, have to rely on kills for their upgrades; as each kill gives you an evolution point that you can spend in the evolution menu before you respawn. Such evolutions include enhanced diver detection, tougher skin, regenerating health, longer speed boost, etc.  Playing as the humans is not too far off from standard first-person shooters, but the underwater combat gives it a an interesting uniqueness that separates it from the rest. You can move in any direction and the movement feels natural. Unlike some underwater sections of other shooters, the water doesn’t feel inhibiting and you can definitely put up a good fight once you get the hang of it. Also, because you are underwater, all you projectiles have travel time. They are by no means slow, but you will often have to lead the sharks slightly to land your hits.  Playing as the sharks is where this game really gets interesting. It feels like playing a living torpedo with teeth on the end of it. The sharks are extremely fast and stealthy, with only a heartbeat sound effect playing for the humans when a shark is close. Grabs are extremely satisfying as you can boost into a room, grab a human, and leave with them, all within the space of a second. The shark also has what I like to call the “shred” mechanic. When you grab a human, you shake the mouse wildly to mimic the shaking of the head sharks do to shred their prey. I don’t often say things like this, but whomever thought of adding this mechanic is a genius. This makes attacks so much more satisfying, and really gets you immersed as playing the shark.   As I’ve said before, no game is perfect, and this game’s main issue is the content is a little on the light side. It’s by no means minimal, but there is only one game mode, albeit a very good one, and 5 maps. This can cause things to get slightly repetitive in long stretches of play, but if you play in hour or so stretches, it’s not really an issue. The developer has announced mod tools for the game in the near future, so the map issue will likely become a non-issue once those are released.  This game is a fantastic experience, and a huge recommendation for anyone who has Steam. Depth a great example of a simple idea and a developer wanting to make that experience as fun as possible. Bravo developers, your passion is certainly felt in the final product. So get to chomping on those divers, and keep on gaming!",

            "review_text": "Sharks and Divers. In the water. Together. Now you just know things are going to get nasty. And bloody. Very bloody. And chunky.  Depth is as satisfying to play as either a Diver or a Shark. Divers have access to some nifty weapons and gadgets. They also have S.T.E.V.E. their loot hunting electronic companion. Protect S.T.E.V.E. while he accesses hidden bounties. Take out those menacing sharks. Team, up and become rich but don't go it alone, unless you're uber sneaky or just batcrap insane. Beware, terror can come from all directions. Below, above and through vulnerable structures.  As a shark, it's all about the hunt. Use your instinct upgrades to sniff out those pesky leeching divers. Mangle their tender flesh to pieces. Munch on nearby seals to regain lost life. Being a shark is as awesome feeling as it sounds. Full 360 freedom of movement and that buzz when you go in for the kill. Be brutal or stealthy. Your choice.  As a diver, I often found myself being too greedy while collecting treasure. The more you pick up, the more bonus you receive when you drop your load off with S.T.E.V.E. Be careful though, you'll lose the lot if you're nabbed by a shark. Greed + risk = great rewards.   Visually the game is a above par, considering the small team. Beautiful underwater effects, stunning detail of bounty-laden shipwrecks, the sprawling sea life, the fluid shark movement and flippy floppy animations of the diver's, errr, flippers. The team have also introduced full body awareness, which adds to the immersion. It's quite cool seeing your own legs/feet flipping around... but not so when they're lodged in a shark's mouth...stab him in the face to escape!  A mention must also go to the game's audio. Stellar music and sound effects are in abundance as well as the blood curdling screams of your team mates when they're being thrashed to pieces by those nasty man eating fish. Your heartbeat resonates when you're near a shark, this only adds to the tension.  Technically, the game is very stable and smooth, utilising the Unreal Engine 3. The maps are sprawling, undersea death in disguise. Good, detailed textures adorn most surfaces and the water effects add to the chill. There's also destructibles, which play a key part of the game when playing as a shark. Add to that a plethora of game and graphical options, which PC gamers come to expect are here. Just shows you don't need to be a AAA multi million dollar publisher/game dev to make a decent PC game.  Overall; a fab game at a reasonable price. A few more game modes wouldn't go a miss but i'll soldier on eating people and harpooning fish. I look forward to seeing what Quick &amp; Co can cook up next. Zombie sharks anyone?",

            "review_text": "I personally really recomend this game. Speaking for myself i've been having a blast playing it and i just got it a few days ago. It's fast paced matches usually don't take an extreme ammount of time. Matchfinding times are short, and the gameplay is set up pretty well in my opinion as far as usage and balance. I can see how it might possibly get old for some people but so far i've had it maybe 3 days and already spent 12 and a half hours in it and i don't even have much time for games I'm usually working but i've been off for 2 days and it's been a blast in this short time. Fun to play with friends or alone. Being a diver can give you that feel like a classic The Hidden-Source of never knowing when you're going to be slaughtered and the great feel when hunting down the shark and netting them and shooting them to bits. By far my favorite thing in this though is playing as the shark. I mainly play as the shark and there is no better feeling then swooping sombody in and out of a room ripping them to bits.  So TLDR If you want a cheaply priced game that you'll definantly get your money out of and have a blast alone or with friends as long as you're willing to get the hang of playing and get past being new, then this is a great game.  I hope to see you all down below...in the Depths where I lurk",

When you have the crew together and they hide in corners the game gets annoying as a shark. The sharks are really unbalanced at first and until you unlock stronger gear own you. Very fun game.

            "review_text": "Sharks vs. humans. Do I need say more?  I will anyway...  I'll say my overall thought on the game before I really talk about what's in the game. Although I personally think this game is a 10/10, I will warn you that if you get bored of one gamemode easily this might not be your game. The one gamemode this game has brings fun refreshing gameplay that feels unique to the FPS genre, of course, it's also really fun to eat people in 3rd person as the shark.  After playing as both a diver and shark as much as I have (add another 12 hours of time I played during the beta), I would say Depth is fairly well balanced (highly based on skill level, you will get a butt whoopin' every now and then). Sharks do seem a little bit on the OP side due to their speed but I pretty much only feel this way against a select few players that I know by name. I cannot stress enough how skill based this game is, but I've never had this much fun.   I believed I have covered everything necessary.. If you have any further questions about depth feel free to message me!  If you've seen Evolve gameplay it's very similar, exept replace the monster with 2 sharks, and the 4 hunters with divers. Depth has some fairly simple goals for each team. The sharks earn points for killing divers and can spend those points towards perks which grant the shark new abilities. Sharks can also recover health by eating seals that swim around the map. Divers on the other hand, must try to stay alive and accumulate enough gold to purchase better gear whilst also defending S.T.E.V.E. the robot companion that will work its way across the map opening safes. If the divers kill all the sharks or escort S.T.E.V.E. back to the boat, the sharks have failed to defend their territorry.   Depth has some interesting features that help make the gameplay feel unique: - To do damage as a shark, you have to shake your mouse back and forth violently. The Sharks are given 'wallhack' so that they can always see where the divers are. It is most important that the sharks use this to their advantage to take out divers one by one. Sharks can also choose to attack S.T.E.V.E. doing so will stall S.T.E.V.E. and require him to reboot, enough damage to S.T.E.V.E. will destroy him. Sharks have a wide variety of perks to choose from which you can combine in ways to make your shark tougher, faster, or smarter (earning 'wallhack' on mines or seeing what weapon a diver is holding).  - The Divers are given a heart beat sound which speeds up the closer they are to a shark. If the heart is pounding, you're probably about to feed the shark. The only ways the divers can get the 'wallhack' effect on the sharks is by using sonar beacons or flares (both with limited range), or tracing rounds (limited time). There is lots of diver gear to choose from, I won't list every single one but there are multiple pistols, auto rifes, and spear type weapons.   REVIEW UPDATE (as of last major patch in December): -There are now two additional sharks to play as, The Mako - agile but weak, and The Tiger - the average shark. The Great White was turned into a swimming tank. -An additional map has been added bringing the total maps up to 6, all maps feel very balanced -They also added a King of the Hill style gamemode using the Megalodon shark as the 'hill'. The gamemode can be summarized as such: collect gold as a diver to upgrade your weapons (similar to the core game) win by reaching 15000 points first, the fastest way to score is to be the Megalodon shark. Become the Megalodon by killing the player who is the Megalodon. Gamemode is very very casual and not intense at all. Not my cup of tea (but that's just my opinion)",

Your defense against the predatory sharks consists of:  - regular guns (pistols, machine guns) - spear/harpoon guns - useful consumable items like flares and mines.  These are purchased via a CS:GO-like economy system; want more cash to upgrade to a better weapon? You have to take the risk of moving away from the designated path to grab more loot (and be an easier target for fast-moving teeth!).  Playing as the sharks, on the other hand, is equally exhilarating, but from a position of delicate power instead of insane fear. You are essentially a glass-cannon archetype: able to inflict immense bursts of damage via razor-sharp teeth (and, later, via brutal charges using your dangerous fins), but able to be taken down with only a few shots from a wary diver's pistol...or a single harpoon. You have the ability to effortless glide through the murky waters (and it is dark!) and explode out of the shadows to rip an unknowing diver to literal pieces. Your abilities include forceful dashes (a small one and a larger one) and sprints that consume various amounts from a slowly-refilling pool of energy; once you grab hold of a diver, you thrash your mouse back and forth to tear the flailing swimmer limb from limb. You can also break through weak points in walls, ceiling, and floors! Lastly, your upgrades consist of unique predator traits like the ability to spot mines more easily, slice apart divers with serrated fins, regenerate health after a successful kill, and many others.  TL;DR - Depth is a 2v4 (two sharks vs four divers) asymmetric PvP multiplayer indie game (you can play in parties of 6 if you want to hear only your best buds' shrieks of panic). If you haven't given Depth a whirl, I can't recommend it enough. It's fresh, visceral, intense, and an absolute blast to play with friends or against random internet strangers.",

Since the rounds are short it's a great game to play when you don't have much time. Another cool aspect of the game for me is that the main game is 2 sharks, vs 4 divers, so I can play with my signifigant other as a SHARK TEAM.   Some negatives about the game are, lack of communication (people hardly use the push to talk function), and also that bad teammates can frequently loose you the game. The reason for this is that both divers and sharks share a finite number of respawns.   Overall I highly recomend this game. It is great now and I see it becomming better.",

Well, you can 'git gud' or what most people do, leave the match before it has even started, because you already know it's wasting your time. You can't escape this. Some high-skilled players even create another steam account, buy Depth again and 'surprise' you. Of course, you can't prove it. You see people with ten or twenty matches on the record, knowing every corner of the map, knowing how to perfectly handle a certain shark with special skill requirements, avoiding every possible mistake. In the end you either adapt to the scene or leave them alone. I guess, most people better leave them alone.",

In this asymmetrical, multiplayer, underwater FPS/3rd person shark game you get to experience both.  To even the homefield advantage the sharks have the humans are equiped with all kinds of nasty devices to make a deadly shark into chunks of fish food.  As a shark you have superior your senses which allow you to sense the human players and a maw full of razor sharp teeth to turn divers into dinners.  The longer you play the better you get with level up skill and item unlocks. It can be really tough at first but just stick with it and before long you'll be a nearly unstoppable killing machine.  Humans need to work together, watch each other's backs, and not swim off on their own in search of loot where they're easy targets for the sharks. Deploy mines and sonar beacons to blow up or detect nearby unfriendly fishies. When the sharks are away grab loot to spend on better weapons and equipment. Your heart beats faster as the sharks get nearer!  As a shark upgrade with evolutions to make you more powerful, faster, more resilient to damage. Lunge at those sonar beacons to blind the human's technology. Hit and run, don't let them get a bead on you! Smash S.T.E.V.E. to slow down the human's progress. Watch out for the mines! Work with your shark partner to cause chaos in the human ranks! Lunge at a diver and then vicerally thrash your mouse back and forth to shred them in your jaws!  Depth is a blast to play either in pubs or with friends. Depth is also very stable. The developers are continuously supporting this product. They've deployed patches to fix issues, and updates that have added two new shark classes, a new map, and an entirely new play mode called Megalodon Hunt!  I highly recommend this title to anyone looking for a new gaming experience with roots in the familiar FPS and 3rd Person shooter genres.",

If you can get a game where the other sharkknows what he is doing then it is the easiest game to beat, however if the divers have an ace then they can be the ones who give you a stuggle. I also think that this game is meant to be one you play with friends to get those reactions of, them being the last one while steve is trudging along, then BAM shark comes along and kills them. One thing i would like to see changed is the point and progression system. I have noticed that as he shark you do not get nearly enough points in agood game as the divers do. Also the progression system seems to slow down to a crawl at around level four or five. All in all though this game is great and i hope even more people get it (So it doesnt take me five minutes to get into a match).",

The worst thing about this game is when ever you get within 100 yards of a diver, they glow in outlined red and can be seen through walls(exactly like in Counter Strike arms race). So there is no hiding from the sharks like 1 might think. So just don't expect that. Once a shark is hit with a tagging round they are also red outlined for 200 yards out for about 20 seconds. So that takes out a little of the fun to. BUT none of this takes away from you having to defend your self(and your pals) inside a room(sunken ship or scary tomb), you still have to be on edge and watch all entrances or die a horrible death. Very fun being a diver! But pretty boring being the sharks for they have only 2 attacks(2 lunges, not regular bite or whip) while the divers have a arsenal.  RECOMMENDED!  *On a total side note. I ran into my first hacker today 8/22/2015. Never had a problem before.",

I only played 10 hours worth of it and its fun if you want to go and scare your friends in pitch black seas. Overall, its a very fun game to play with friends but somewhat boring by yourself.  The downside to this game is that in 10 hours worth of time, I have completed a little over 90% of the achievements. Its too easy to complete achievements and awards in this game. There is too little content to (for me anyways, i like large content) keep playing this for weeks at a time due to so little content in-game. The closest example of this game I would say is like a Jaws underwater CSGO type of game with controls and gameplay.  I recommend this game because its quite fun but it needs much more content otrher than new skins and maps. With more content I would play this much longer but its still very fun for scaring the ♥♥♥♥ out of friends.  quick tip and somewhat spoiler: Every single developer and major youtube who has spotlighted/played this game extensive has their name on AI controlled characters. Like Ohmwrecker is the name of usually an AI shark in-game.  9/10 very fun 3/10 needs way more content 100/5 would massively jumpscare again in pitch black to point of almost destroying my mouse",

            "review_text": "Life is like a cake full of divers, you never know what you're going to get.   Depth is an Asymetric horror FPS where you take the role of either a diver or a shark. The divers have numbers on their side 4v2 but the sharks have speed strengh and stealth as well as the ability to wall hack divers. This is done through what is called evolutions, a kill based progression system for the shark. This grants abilites such as infinite stamina for a short period, razor fins that do close range damage among other things. Each kill is a point and you spend them before you respawn.   Playing as a diver is intense, you're always on edge unless you are working together tighly with your squad. You start of with a pistol and a knife and gather treasure and guard a robot to progress your equipment. You can purchase various weapons from pistols, spear guns, assault rifles as well as consumables like flairs and under sea mines. You always need to watch your surroundings avoid exits and do not stray alone from the pack. The sharks are looking for an oppurtunity.   Playing as a shark is for me more relaxed. You can pick and choose when to engage and when to stalk. If it is not beneifical to you can wait to attack. You are faster and stronger than the divers, and you have the element of surpise usually. However even a great white is a glass cannon if caught in heavy fire. And any shark is done for if caught in a net, play the shark in a plotting, stealthy way. Don't run in with no plan unless the divers are spread out and lacking good equipment.   Pros-Original mechanics Polished in nearly every way for an indie game Excellent class balance in an asytmetic game.  You can play as a shark  Cons- At the time of writing there aren't many players. There are are only 2 game modes, Sharks VS divers collecting gold and a Megladon game, where the person who kills the Megladon becomes it.  Rare frame drops.    Overall I would reccomend it, the game is lots of fun and needs more players. I think it has the potential to be very succesful.",

You can play as a shark - huge Great Whites (slow but take a beating), a Mako (Super fast, but weaker), or a Tiger Shark (kind of a mix of the two) and you can adapt throughout the game to best hunt the players you're after.  Equally, if you decide to play as a human (whether pub matches or with friends), you are nonstop upgrading yourself as well. I've found that they reward me for kills, assists, collecting gold, etc. and you can use all of it to buy better weapons (everything from a tiny little pistol [looks like a .22] and a spearfishing pistol all the way up to explosive harpoons, assault rifles, and mines to blow sharks to pieces.

Overall, I'd give this game a 9/10. - It's got refreshing gameplay and controls (like the movement), and every match feels different (as the maps have plenty of corridors and sharks/humans can adapt to each others' playstyle). The only thing keeping the game from being a complete 10/10 is the fact that they need a bit more content, and a few minor fixes.

If you are a shark you cant just go in to were the humans are, with there closed space it will be a suicide. you can lure them out and then take them out easily with the mako. you can try and find another room near S.T.E.V.E thats close with less than 3 people and get in with a thresher, snapping and making everyone dizzy, then killing everyone in the room easily with your teammate (hammerhead most recommended to do that with a thresher). you can bust in the walls with a hammerhead and surpise a human hiding, while your other teammate covers you (great white most recommended to do that with a hammerhead) or you might just find 2 entrances and plan one as your escape and your entrance while using a tiger shark, going in fast and escaping in camoflauge. now if you feel like your only stratergy is to go NUTZ you use the great white to get in easily and destroy every human (if you are alone chances are you will die fast, better to do that with another great white). and lets be honest: if you and your teammate dont co-operate and plan the attack, there is a low chance to win.  but what about humans? if you are just going any man for himself your pretty much a goner. you can buy an assult rifle with toxic bullets and hide between corners in close areas with your teamamates, ambushing any shark who comes in. you might also set mines, sensors, flares. you can also shoot a shark and tag it, then have a night vision scope speargun and try and snipe the shark. the truth is the main startergy of humans is strong teamwork to kill any shark that bites your team, plus theres 2 sharks and 4 humans....SHARKS WATCH OUT!!!  in my conclusion, this game is filled with challenging and fun stratergies, and you wont get very good at it at the start....",

Not only this, they added new game modes and expanded the choices for sharks. Whom all have their unique capabilities.  Which is great, it is one of the few games that I've purchased in early access and truly recomended others to buy. Since it's great fun!  The only thing I could wish for is perhaps some added dangers for the divers, for example: make the jellyfish actually sting you, perhaps add diving sickness if you remerge too fast while fleeing from sharks and maybe bring up the possilibity of a purchasable flashlight that is brighter and so forth. For the sharks I just wish that you could eat the small fish for some added healthpoints, and perhaps even the squid with a percentage of a chance for killing you as they tend to get stuck in the esophagus.  These are just minor things that I could want. I really recomend it! It will be fun to see what the developers add in the near future! :D",

As a diver you (e.g.) have to defend your tresor unlocking robo-buddy and after short time you hear this heart-beating and it beats louder and louder. Then suddenly a shadow in the depth and you just want to swin away or crouch in any corner ... but there is no save plave, no place to hide... This is the point, that devides this game from many, many other games in which you can go to some corners or places where you are at least a bit safer. In other games there are strategies how to win the game - in this game your strategie is to survive and and in any case: STAY TOGETHER no diver can win this game on his own (so sorry for all battlefield-lovers)  As a shark hou have this feeling of an mighty predator that creeps around the divers, your preys - and they even don't know it that you are right beside them! (Relly creepy for divers btw. when you know this fact ;-) )  In fact it is similar to Natural Selection (II) This fight is between nature and mankind. This feeling of an superior might in the dark. Futhermore you can choose at nature's side between few different shark types with various advanteges and disadvanteges (Makos e.g. are verys very fast but also really weak) and you can spend points in your evolution. As a diver you can gain money by collecting treasures and defending your tresor-opening robo-friend. Then you can buy better weapons and defending systems and also upgrades.  So as I said before, very similar to NS but with much more heart attacking moments and unsupected deaths (but without frustation!). Most (unexpected) horrifying game since a long time!!

Play as a shark and get the satisfaction of thrashing your mouse back and forth until the puny humans die a gruesome death at your jaws-crunching noises included. Try out different species of sharks for added abilities that make you tougher, faster, or harder to spot.  Or forget all that and join a slew of other divers in a juggernaut-type game where you try to take down a megalodon, only to become one yourself if you succeed.  The community is generally friendly, with its own set of slang. Sure you'll get the occasional lvl 100's ganging up or who feel that other players are worthless shrimp; but mostly, everyone is pretty chill to play with.  Definintely recommended.

Pro’s: Easy to learn, good skill progression, really easy to run, well balanced, great longevity, and REALLY STINKIN’ FUN!!!!   Con’s: 3 game modes, not enough maps, community is bad, only recommend buying if you have friends to play with, way too expensive to buy at standard price.  Gameplay:  Depth is a game that is notably easy to learn but hard to master. Playing as a shark sounds like it would be really difficult but it's actually really easy. Sharks handle just the same as the diver, so jumping from one to the other is extremely intuitive. Each of the 6 sharks has a distinct advantage over the previous one with different levels of durability, speed, and killing power. Playing as a diver is the easier of the two roles at the start, since the divers get a heartbeat variating from slow, medium to fast depending on how close the shark is. Gunplay is also a pleasant surprise considering the setting is in water. Guns and water don’t usually mix, but they sure do in this case. Bullets from guns also have water resistance so they move slower and don’t travel very far but have enough power so they don't feel weak, which makes the game actually playable for the sharks. Since all of the weapons are well balanced and require skill to use, the more powerful weapons are not always a go to because they are expensive and take time to collect the necessary cash in order to buy, but these expensive weapons are usually a one shot kill. But considering that, it doesn't become unfair for the shark fighting against the divers with the more powerful weapons as they are a single shot and then you have to reload.  Game Modes:  Only three? Yeah. Only three game modes, that's a pretty absurdly low number of game modes to choose from. But on the bright side, the three modes are really well done and present different difficulties to each type of player by presenting teamwork, survival, progress, competition, and FUN! First game type is Blood and Gold. Each side has 30 life tickets. Diver’s are to protect the automated submersible robot that collects treasure from designated points along a linear track, stopping at each of the points for about 1-2 minutes while the divers are to protect themselves and said robot, all while scavenging for miscellaneous treasure to collect more cash to buy more weapons and upgrades for weapons. Sharks meanwhile are to kill divers. Each kill results in 10 upgrade points to spend on evolutions like bleed damage, more protection and better stamina. The second gamemode is Megalodon. All players spawn in as divers and the first one to kill the roaming Megalodon becomes it. Whoever has the most kills at the end as the Megalodon wins. Last gamemode is Hide and Seek. Pretty simple. Divers hide, sharks seek. The Heartbeat is a huge tool for the divers in this mode as it adds a huge level of immersion and intensity to this simple gamemode, all the sharks have to go on is localizing the sound of the divers respirator and the distinct looking bubbles coming from the respirator.  Community/Online Connectivity:  Oh dear. This is where this game has one of its shortcomings and why I would only recommend purchasing this game if you have a minimum of 3 friends to play with. Depth’s community is pretty trash. If you are a “noob” at this game and just bought it, don’t bother jumping into a public server as the more seasoned players will absolutely destroy you. People also leave matches consistently making it hard to really enjoy playing on public lobbies. Depth has very good connectivity with very good netcode so there isn’t any rubber-banding or lag at all, and its servers are really stable other than a few times where my friends would jump into a private hide and seek server and it would change it to a blood and gold game mode. But other than a few weird moments like that, it was solid.  Looks:  This game looks fantastic. Blur effects with being in the water limiting visual distance are on point adding to the suspense and realism. Lighting in this game is a huge deal, as a diver you get to experience the bigger contrast in how light or dark the scenery is by the level of light fading as you dive deeper, also adding to the immersion. I would say the only real complaint I have with this game’s aesthetics is the ambient wildlife such as the fish, as they look more akin to plastic replicas rather than real life fish. Also adding to that the pathing for the wildlife is incredibly basic, but gets the job done for a “fuller world”.  Performance, Stability, and Options:  Depth runs incredibly well, maintaining 60 frames per second even on lower end systems, unless you are running it on a potato laptop with integrated graphics. All thanks to how scalable this game is by the many options it has to offer.  Price/Content:  I’m sorry but Depth is not worth $25. Considering when there are only three game modes with not enough maps for 2 out of the 3 is practically criminal. Especially when there is 14 DLC packs for this game. each of these packs is $5-6, 10 of which are skin packs and 1 of the 2 “Character Packs” is a diver, which is just a skin because the divers don’t have stats differentiating themselves from one another. Hide and Seek only has 4 maps and Megalodon has 5, while Blood and Gold has 12 maps. Seems awfully unbalanced for only having three gamemode. Depth is just not worth $25 as the standard price. I would say its value for what you get is $10, not more, not less. Luckily this game does go on sale fairly frequently for around $10 which makes up for most of what I have just covered in this section. This was really the big problem for me when reviewing this game.  Other Notes:  Digital Confectioners needs to add custom server support, and REALLY need to add map creation tools for this game. Put these two things out and you are going to have a huge spike in overall player count. I can also think of two really cool game modes for Digital Confectioners to add. Shark Vs Shark, and Diver Vs Diver I suggest the titles to be “Blood Bath”, and “Water Wars” respectivel, because alliterations, and they would be so rad. I mean 3v3 sharks! That would be an insane game mode if implemented correctly.  Final Conclusion:  Depth is a wonderful game with a great implementation of underwater combat that is beautiful to look at, has intensity and suspense, and is incredible to play at lan parties. I love this game despite its bad community, lack of content, and its huge price tag. But when you sit down and play a few rounds with your friends, those problems fade away as you are having so much fun teasing your friends about how they can't find you in hide and seek, or how you are fighting in blood and gold down to the last life ticket, that’s when this game makes up for its shortcomings.",

Most matches end up going down to the wire and ending on the final trip back to the diver cage.  The developer supports this game better than AAA companies support their games (cough Evolve cough). All non-cosmetic content for this game has been 100% free from the start; this includes several maps as well as new shark classes. They also push out Holiday updates that add to the charm and bring a smile to my face when I see S.T.E.V.E. in a sheet like a ghost or with Christmas lights and jingle bells.

This game may be exactly what you've been dreaming of! Hopefully it wasn't exactly nightmares, but, eh.. I've really been scared quite a few times in this game.  Seriously, though, this game offers 7 unique maps (10 total, 3 modified versions), 10-20 equipment items for divers, and an unlimited amount of opportunities for personal experiences. This game is a great price for the content, definitely worth it, even not on sale. The only letdown about this game is that I really wish there was more! I've seen all the maps, tried all the items, and I can only ask for more content! I honestly would be able to put hundreds of hours into this game if there was enough.  The game's pretty popular, so you'll get into a game really quickly. The shark mechanics are just BEAUTIFUL and STUNNING! It really makes you get a malicious smile on your face while you rip the pleading divers to nothingness, and then crunch them to regain health.... Just me?  I love this game, so much. 20/10. Amazing. Fantastic. More words meaning good. Get this game. Get this game! You. Will. Have. Fun.",

Shaders and effects (especially those from the water) ask for 'too much' of 'normal' store-bought PC's. - Those who pay for DLC's get a huge advantage.  WOULD I RECOMMEND IT? Well, yeah.

            "review_text": "(TL;DR at very bottom)  This is one of these games that makes me wish there was a 'maybe' button. I like this game, don't get me wrong, it's simple, it's nice and it's a rather decent game to pick up and start playing.  But, with every good game there's a catch... The menu in my opinion is really... outdated.... I kinda felt like i was looking at something from when i was a kid... somewhere in the time where ps2 was huge. The animations for humans don't feel 100% polished... kinda like... odd to see the same people again and again.... the transition from standing to suddenly swiming gets me every time.... I felt the graphics were well done but, there was just a constant issue of feeling it wasn't really made around these years.  The shark animations are really well done, with jigglebone and what not, but since you can thrash you mouse around when playing them, it kinda ruins the fact that if you take it slow it looks amazing. All i see is a silly shark barely moving around.  The atmosphere is rather nice, i rather enjoyed the area's and the way they looked. Some things really threw it off like, the treasure kinda being really off angled and making little sense. With a little bit of polish and what not all these little things can be improved cause really the game is enjoyable, like... i won't hold back when saying i do enjoy playing this game but i find it really really easy.  For the sharks, there's an easy meta that you go by and you pretty much are unstopable. Also when it comes to playing shark, i kinda just felt myself doing the same old same old. Right click, thrash the mouse around, right click again, blah blah blah you get the drift and suddenly their team is dead. When i have a teammate and they do bad I kinda sit there questioning how they did so... seeing how easy I find the g ame to be.  With human it's kinda the same in the sense you do the same thing. Net gun, anything above assault rifle or spear gun and flares and you pretty much just won the match. Buy things like dual pistols or that... dome that makes you 'invisable' to sharks and you pretty much just cost yourself the game.  The net gun has a tendancy to be whined and ♥♥♥♥♥ed about or kinda just broken at times. I found myself shooting and seeing the netting go straight at a sharks face but they kinda just ignored it and i was in their grasp somehow. But, a well placed net saves a teammate or your own ♥♥♥.  Now.... the audio... I get it... you're underwater and everything... but... it really throws you off... Heartbeats indicate a shark is nearby... which, honestly... destroyes the 'horror' of the game seeing as you know one is around you so it's like 'okay... here's it's openings, come get me...' as you wait with your netgun in hand, waiting for the predictable enemy to come in and snag you.  Gun sounds are pretty alright, i like em and rather enjoy them. They have a... so to say crisp sound to them. Buuuut then we get to the voices... 'hmm hmm mm hm hmmm'... okay pyro from tf2 read you loud and clear. Since humans only have 3 skins, there's only i believe 2 variations of voicing. The male varience which you will hear a lot... and the female varience which kinda just sounds like a higher pitch and... well... a lot more annoying. There were times I kinda sat there with net gun in hand and watched the shark kill the female just so i didn't have to hear the scream again.  Now onto the gore. It is rather nice i must admit, makes me urk a bit seeing a floating teammates body or shark's floating around. It's rather nice and disturbing. Bullet marks left in the body's and what not, even knife marks make a really nice change to the pace.  When being attacked it's kinda the same thing over and over... 'Here's the shark, he now has me. I left click 3 times, and i'm dead. If i'm not a teammate actually saved me, but now the next time i get attacked i'm ♥♥♥♥ed.'  Yeah, there's persistant health for the humans, so you get attacked you're basically screwed, that damage stays with you. But the sharks get regeneration. Seeing as there's only 2 sharks and 4 humans it's rather understandable why. Sharks get natural regen which is slow, but they can get perks to heal when getting a kill and heal while out of combat. They can also eat seals to regain a portion of hp. All in all it's rather nice and kinda fair.  The ship... guy we'll just call him cause he doesn't really play a big role, has a rather simplistic looping animation of him smoking. But... if you don't look carefully it looks like he's kinda smoking underwater and it.... it's odd. His presence throws off the atmosphere seeing as well... there's this amazing landscape around you! looks so nice! suddenly mgs 2's audicon pops up in the left hand side with it's 90's appearence and style to throw everything they did into the water. He doesn't even have a voice or anything which would be a lot better.  I took a careful look at the robot and some days he looks amazing annnnd other's he looks like wall-e. His textures have moods i guess. His creation is rather nice and interesting buuuuuuut yet again there's a flaw with his look and everything that kinda just throws me off. He follows the same pattern every time so it's really predicatable as a shark on where to attack next. If the pattern was randomized each time and what not it'd be amazing, cause it feels like this lil robot just has a gps built into saying 'next treasury in 2 miles. Take a left turn in 3 seconds.'  anyways, you can tell if you read through all this i'm rather mixed. It's an easy game, looks nice but has it's flaws. I don't see any horror in this game seeing as the heartbeat system ruins it entirely. maybe if you somehow turn that off and like... take away all the hud options, you'd have a terrifying expereience but.... i'm not feeling any horror here. Your choice on if you want to buy it, cause it's fun i won't lie but.... it's.... like 5 year olds are playing this game at times...",

The forum runs rampant with trollish veteran players, and despite how many reports get filed by me, my friends, none of them get banned for their patterns of behavior regarding comments made on my threads and threads of others.   These veterans that I speak of gang up on people threads in an endeavor to derail a thread and get it locked, or even get other people banned. They have a group page where they OPENLY mock those they eventually get banned. I am one of those people, because in ONE reply to MY OWN THREAD, I said 'if I ever met a certain player in real life I would put my fist through their face'.  This however, was several pages into the thread after I had reported them MULTIPLE times for their unrelated videos, trollish memes and other unrelated comments.   Had the moderators done their job sooner, I may not have been subsequently banned becaue I was insighted by these people who admit to doing it intentionally.   I submit to you, that this game has a certain level of corruption, a severe lack of moderator activity that also favors the veterans who make up a large portion of the current community.   This game is infested with shameless, cold hearted, relentless trolls, and I am severely questioning ever playing this game again if these people are not dealt with in an appropriate manner by the moderators.   The fact that this games community has been so drastically effected by its veteran players is astounding and I truly hope it changes for the better before the game is completely dead.

Input device options : Keyboard + mouse PS4 controller Steam controller Xbox 360 controller Xbox one controller   Diver weapons : knife (not changable). 2 guns - you have to buy and upgrade each match. consumable (like mines / turret / shark shield ...).

You defend the ship by building towers that shoot bubbles against waves of fish and other creatues. The waves in the beginning consist mainly of shrimp and gold fish, but eventually there are also sharks, electric eels and ancient sea monsters. The sharks have a chance to drop golden keys you can use to unlock treasure chests for cosmetic items for your diver character. These treasure chest keys can be purchased in the online shop for $2 each as well. These cosmetic items might seem like merely cosmetic but they are in fact very powerful items and if you rock a full set of certain items you destroy the game balance completely. My friend who's had a good few hours into this has bought an entire pirate set in the shop and when we play his underwater parrots destroy all the waves single handedly. The sea lions don't stand a chance. The Bismarck DLC is pretty cool though, where you defend the ship against nazi zombie ghosts, even though the swastikas are shark heads instead.",

GOD ♥♥♥♥ING DAMNIT. update on my review march 23. this game is still reta.rded but i was ♥♥♥♥♥♥ when i wrote this review i have calmed down. if you are trying to find a good scare from this game you wont find it. i mean maybe when you get killed for the first time you will but it becomes annoying very fast. if you think this game is a realistic game where the sharks are like actual sharks in real life your dead wrong. the idea of controlling a shark was interesting to me but i had a totaly different idea of what the game would be like. if sharks were like this in real life every one in the entire world would say ♥♥♥♥ that im never goin in the ocean again. so in the end this game in my opinion is stupid. but if you like those kinda games where its unballanced and there is always that 1 op class (in this case the mako) or you like camping and waiting to die or win. your probobly going to like depth. if you hate ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and unreal situations and getting wreked unless you camp and huddle together with your team and not being able to explore cause you will die if you do and like being able to stealth. stay the ♥♥♥♥ away from depth.",

Also, what the established long-term players typically want is to have no mechanics that help new players have any chance, they want to punish players who leave games when the games are blow out lockdowns, etc. Basically the established 'veterans' and self-proclaimed 'pros' want to stomp players with less talent/experience for 10 minutes and punish those less talent/experienced players for leaving. It's ridiculous. And then you have to deal with BM's in game and harassment on the forums, and it's all enabled by the developers, or at least that's what some of these 'veterans' are claiming.  As an example of what you will have to deal with, a certain individual kept attacking me over and over.

            "review_text": "I would strongly recommend this game to new players, especially considering that on top of being a fun, unique, and intense game, it can only get better with a larger community. The concept is very simple. One team of 4 plays as divers while the other team of 2 plays as sharks. The divers start out with a small sum of money which can be used to purchase low level weapons/upgrades, and then divers gain money by collecting treasure, killing/assisting sharks, and playing support to their team. This can then be used to purchase better weapons and upgrades. The sharks rack up 'evolution' points by killing and injuring divers which allows them to upgrade their abilities. Overall it is an extremely fun game that can offer many hours of fun while also providing a fresh experience for gamers tired of the same old shooters.  As you might see from other reviews, playing as a diver is more difficult than playing as sharks, but I have not found that to significantly detract from the fun. The developers for this game are very responsive and connected with the community, so hopefully the game will continue to become more balanced.  The game is even more fun if you can play with a group of friends. Especially with its smaller game settings. You will never have so many induced heart attacks as you will playing this game. My only reservations, which I feel obligated to mention are that: 1) the maps, weapons, upgrades, and playable characters is relatively small variety. However, I think that this puts a greater emphasis on strategy and keeps the game simple and fun, rather than flooded with weapon types and customizations that confer unfair advantages. 2) You need to have a smooth framerate and little lag to enjoy the game. Otherwise you will never be able to play well as either team. So if you have a less powerful computer, expect to turn down the graphics/resolution in order to play smoothly. The game still looks great for me though, and I play on a mediocre gaming laptop.  I hope more people will keep playing this game. The bigger community the better.",

Long story short... you can have 4 average to good players as divers, and 2 similar skilled sharks, and diver team will win way more often than not. It's lame af and needs fixed.

Granted, some of the creative minds behind this game also worked on Killing Floor but one would think ‘Seriously, divers vs. sharks!? How are the divers going to stand a chance?’   Well, let me tell you that they most certainly do stand a chance, and what’s more, after playing Depth for a number of hours as both I can most assuredly confirm that the scales are actually tipped in favor of divers. Why is that? One word: Firepower. You start small with two types of underwater handgun or a spear gun that you can purchase with the $800 you initially have. As you and your team collect more bling, assuming you survive that long, you can purchase a couple SMGs, a net gun, a harpoon gun w/ explosive tip and even sea mines (these are consumable along with a med kit and flares, etc., but you can have 3 at once and they are really powerful – but be warned, you can just as easily be killed by them as they can kill a shark + the sharks can use them against you!). The divers also have S.T.E.V.E. which is their underwater ROV buddy that cuts into safes for not only more bling beyond that which you find scattered in random places, but as an element of the core gameplay – divers win either by killing all the sharks (2 sharks at a time w/ 30 respawn chances) or by surviving long enough for S.T.E.V.E. to not only cut into 4 safes but also make it back to the boat without all divers having been eaten or without being destroyed (don’t worry, he has a good bit of life and can be repaired).  Let’s not forget about the sharks. You have a Tiger, Thresher, Mako, Hammerhead and Greatwhite, each with their own unique stats and upgradeable abilities. The abilities they possess can really stagger the gameplay in their favor but first you’ll have to take out enough divers to acquire the necessary skill points that will allow for the upgrades. Believe me, even against a good group of divers and their guns, the sharks can easily win a match when the players playing as sharks are even better. Also, there’s even a game mode called Megalodon Hunt that allows 1 player to start as the legendary, though sadly extinct (or is it? ;] ) Megalodon. The player that gets the kill shot then becomes the Megalodon until he/she is killed and so on. Pretty fun!  Lastly, the controls in this game are pretty tight and make maneuvering underwater as either a diver or shark a lot of fun and the frames are consistent which is nice. To me this has been one of the more enjoyable, unique multiplayer FPS experiences I’ve had while gaming and is definitely worth $25 (of course a sale price is nice too). ",

Not epic but its okay. One thing to mention ... bots... if a player leaves a bot takes his place and there is no punishment for leavers atm. The problem with bots is... if you are a tiger-shark e.g. and you use your invisible spell, they still shoot you. Thats pretty annoying. And because there is no punishment you got a minimum of one leaver in 9 out of 10 games. If the game will punish leavers in future updates i think it would fix this problem. Another issue not solved yet is a bug with creating a lobby. If you create a lobby you will create a second one and people can join it. while you are in-game the people of your second lobby just wait and flame around because you dont start the game that you CANT start.  The gamemodes:  -Blood and Gold  you and your team escort steve to 3 locations where he needs to open a chest. every team got 30 tickets. the  sharks can also win with destroying steve(nearly impossible because he got much hp and divers can repair him).divers  win automatically if steve plundered all chests and returns to the boat.  -Megalodon-Hunt:  one random diver starts as megalodon, a stronger shark than the choosable sharks in Blood and Gold. first with 10k  points wins the game. If you kill the Megalodon you become the new one.  -Hide and Seek:  Havent played it so far.  All in all the summary:  Positive: -epic fun -innovative game -balanced so far i played -needs tactic and teamplay (if its not a beginner game) -gameplay is natural and you can use a controller (in settings you can chose between ps4, xbox one and xbox360) -many weapons and upgrades for weapons, aswell as many shark upgrades (more unlock if you level up)  Negative: -you may lose connection to the network sometimes (restart steam solves it, but still noisy) -no leaver punishment causes many player to leave if its not going well for them  (even if you dont lose anything while you stay) -only three gamemodes (while you can access the third only if you do quicksearch or a private game) -the price of 23€ is a bit high. i bought it while on sale for 8€ or you can use external shops for 9-10€  i guess",

            "review_text": "This game has quite a big following already on Steam. Over 100 user reviews, general rating is 'Very positive'. I absolutely love it too! I think it could become one of the biggest indie hits of the year.  Depth is in essence an asymmetrical multiplayer-only game about treasure hunting divers and sharks trying to kill them. It's polished for indie, and very well balanced. Playing the shark is absolute blast, but playing a diver is fun too, scary kind of fun.  There are two Great White sharks (played from 3rd person) pitted against four human divers (1st person). Sharks have superior speed, vision and strength and razor sharp teeth, but divers have waterproof guns and other gadgets. The game takes place 100% underwater, in 5 different maps (free DLC maps coming later). Divers are trying to escort a safe-cracking ROV robot through waypoints, collect treasure, sticking together and trying to fight back sharks lurking in the darkness. A heartbeat sound indicates how close a shark is, but not it's direction, which creates paranoia and fear in diver players. Sharks can destroy some roofs and walls, to create new attack routes. Divers are slower than sharks, but have assault rifles, pistols, nets, harpoon, mines, flares and such. Even a small vessels, which can be used to drive around. Sharks have 'Evolutions', which mean unlocking faster speed, better vision etc, but both sides start every round with nothing (Counter-Strike style) and must earn their unlocks. Divers use treasure they collected from safes (+ some extra laying around), sharks get an Evolution Point for each kill. Humans need to stick together, and getting separated from group usually means that you're going to be shark food, especially against competent shark players. Sharks work together too, for example other one creating distraction by thrashing a wall to draw attention.   All of the maps are mostly very dark since it's deep sea, and flashlight + flares light the way. The game is very polished in both visual and gameplay sense, only thing I could nitpick about is the system to join and search for games. It has had occasional joining problems at launch, I'm sure they will fix that ASAP.  I highly recommend this title. It has fairly unique idea, visceral and tense action, scary atmosphere (for diver team) and lot of teamwork... kind of Left 4 Dead vibes here, but different. High polish, good balance and it seems to have strong community and support from devs. Ready up your wetsuit and jump in!",

As a shark stalking down the divers and figuring the best way in and then out is tricky. Under most cases you'll get one diver before the others kill you. However it is possible to get more depending on your play style and the divers themselves. (Basically how lucky or skilled you are.)  A rather fast paced play for the sharks. The action is good and enjoyable. The divers you have to stay on your toes keeping your aim and head searching for any sign of the sharks. Because usually if you miss the body of the shark and only see their teeth, well my friend. You're likely already dead.  The items used by the divers give out a good bonus and helps out well when used right. It helps to counter balance the brutal force of the sharks.   With the added sharks and how they rebalanced them out, it fits in nicely and allows for different play styles.  All in all, I would buy this game over without the slightest hesitation.  10/10",

            "review_text": "More of a netural review, only because of the state of the game. I dont necessarily *not* reccomend it. But people will look in the negative reviews so might as well put this here.  Asymmetrical gameplay and MP done right, Depth accomplishes where many games have failed, balance and a fair game amongst even newcomers. Through much testing the primary 4v2 mode of sharks v divers has come to fruition and brings some of the most tense gameplay I've had since CS:GO, though in contrast to a scarcity of hacking of any kind, and sharing without immense balancing issues. Nearly every match of my now growing 100+ has been fairly close, or at least far only because of lack of experience.  Look at gameplay videos to see how the game actually plays and if it's your sort of thing, I can only tell you that if it seems to have attributes you desire, that it fulfills on them.  I come back to edit parts of this review after all the free content updates that have been released. I left depth many months ago after having my fill, after so many updates I dived back into a much different game, and unfortunately a worse one when it comes to actual balance. Note I said in an earlier review that there arent 'balancing issues' this is true when it comes to raw gameplay. The balance issues come for new players, and the fact that the game is by no means popular anymore. If you que for a shark on a good day, alone mind you, you'll get a match probably every 2 and a half minutes to possible 3, and in a game where learning takes a while oh boy. Though this doesn't have anything to do with balance until you tie it in... the effect of such a low playerbase is basically a dedicated and elite playerbase. As a new player you stand to learn very little from even high level players, with no actual tutorial on good practices and experienced players who don't always even show it can be immensly frustrating to que as a shark for minutes at a time, get completely devestated and have no one able to really help or refuse.  And in this game unfortuantely that is all to likely to happen, and the solution isn't as easy as going to diver side either, as diver side relies much more on a team than shark side does to keep the 4v2 dynamic strong, get an okay team and you can still end up losing to sharks who are just to experienced even for high level players, it takes more than two high skilled players to deal with 1 skilled shark, and figuring out exactly what they are doing can be the riddle of the sphinx for new players, because it requires knowing how to play as a shark as well.. The skill curve for which is immense to say the least. If you don't know how to play as a shark and cant manouver your mouse around for speedy escapes you'll find yourself blundering into rooms and harpooned in seconds while divers only get richer taking advantage of your noob self to gain more gold to gain even more effective ways of killing you, at times it will seem completely unfair and like you cant do anything *right*. This is due to the community not being helpful outside of guides which dont reach far. You can't expect more than 10% of players to bother with guides made by the portion of the community that does try to communicate, and the players that do are to few, to few for a game where the skill isn't albeit as high as a game like CS'GO, still relies on what lets CS:GO succeed without tutorials on recoil and all, the playerbase.  The last problem is the lack of any decent matchmaking and is made exponentially worse by the fact that a single high level shark can carry, while 2 high level divers cant with one high level shark, Sharks skill curve is steep, and once you manage it you can easily stomp on divers with two other teamates who are new or just plain not great, unfortunately with such a small playerbase new players have very little hope of ever getting a fair game.   Oh and side note the servers are pretty mediocre as well. I live in the Western United States and que on a West USA server and get 90-105 ping, this makes a much bigger difference with how many shark types on diver side require precise aim that can be thrown off by ping.  TL;DR A fantastic game with a less than fantastic outcome due to not gaining popularity with a barebones inital release; and most players getting bored then not coming back or noticing the updates, or just plain not caring. It lacks any sort of matchmaking for a balanced game and can put some level 10-30's ingame with an effective GE on CS, levels 90-100. In fact not only can it, it DOES, all, the time. Cautious reccomendation only if you have 5 people to play with of a similar skill level or are willing to read guides and then put in about 10 hours of practice.",

I don't know if it's that my computer(s) is/are compatible for the game or not, but I experience seriously bad lag, despite cranking down the settings all the way to low quality. Another bad experience is that when I equip my melee knife for battle, not trying to fight while in a shark's jaws, that my on-screen knife hand spazzes out far off the map and I have a hard time as to where to aim a stab at a shark. But, the good news is this: this game is very unique. SPOILER ALERT TO COD: GHOSTS! Skip this section if you want to, or read on.      'Bout a year ago when I was playing Call of Duty: Ghosts, there was a level called 'Into the Deep' and one part of the level was to get past a ring of sharks. Sound simple, right? WRONG! I died at LEAST 10 times before I decided to restart the level and follow the other character (Keegan) through the sharks.    I give credit to the COD wiki and the makers of COD. (Made this part so I don't get sued somehow.)      Anyways, back to Depth. The COD level traumatized me ever since. This game brings back that memory. And that memory always makes me sh*t my pants every time I think of it. Because you don't really know when the sharks will strike, you always have a feeling of fear knowing that the sharks can see you, but you can't see them. So, to save me time in describing this, and to make this more appealing to the eyes of the reader(s) of my review, I will make a pro's and con's list.  Pro's *Unique atmosphere *Price fits game *Large amount of weapons to use and abilities to unlock *Emphasizes use of tactics and teamwork *Easy-to-learn gameplay *Lots of fun *Updated often (As of the time of this current form of the review) *Growing community  Con's *Still has a few glitches (Maybe it's my computer[s]) *Have to put every setting to low or off to make sure my game doesn't crash (Again, maybe my computer)  Conclusion: This game is very well-done and reasonably priced. I expect to see great things come out of this game, and I will try to further enjoy the game.

One team is the humans, exploring underwater ruins for treasure and escorting a robot to help them go deeper. The other team is the sharks, and they are demonstrating their position as apex predators of the ocean.  Not only is it asymmetric, but because it's set underwater, the Z axis gets far more attention than in any other team FPS. If you're coming in with experience from other games, be humble and get to know the play style you'll need to survive and succeed.  Both humans and sharks have the by now traditional experience-unlock system. Earn XP as a human and get access to more weapons and gear. Earn XP as a shark and get access to 'mutations' that beef up each species.  In short, if you're getting tired of running around shooting dudes, you can't go wrong with strapping on fins and diving into the ocean to test your mettle.",

I can be the diver or a shark, match play is quick, online multiplayer seems to work well, and gives me options to play with friends in the same match. the negative side of that would be the wait times between matches and a somewhat slow load in as individuals (all 6 of us if no bots) select our options.  Drops are a little too rare and sparse, which is a shame. It seems to really want to force you to paid skins and weapons, but the game can be enjoyed without those.   No real gameplay glitches or crashes that I've seen. On the whole, this short-attention span match style works for me. Course they had me at, 'you wanna be the shark and eat people?'",

Anyone new to the game starting as a diver will go from shivers down the spine to wetting themselfs in horro when they see a shark comming at them. But now that I have played for some time that feeling is gone and I most sertonly enjoyed having it.Though there is a lack of weapons there is the basics and thats quite enough. Even with the original feeling i had when i first got the game gone it's still a blast to be playing especially with friends.There are some weapons need balencing like the single shot pistol and a lack of trashure for four people on the map in blood money but those are simple fixes and not even big enough problems for me to stop playing. So I would gladly reccomend this game to anyone sick off shooting guy in T-Shirt with forein accent and even if your arn't sick you need to get this game.",

One thing preventing me from reccomending this whole heartedly is the automatic weapons they allow players to earn through gold pickups. They completely ruin the dynamic of divers escaping the sharks, with auto weapons its ambushing the sharks and widdling their lives down making it unfun/boring for the divers, and unfair/annoying to the sharks.  Other than that the game is really fun, but annoying at points, its a fun game if you get your friends together and play hide and seek and megaladon, but blood and gold is really annoying as it is right now.",
