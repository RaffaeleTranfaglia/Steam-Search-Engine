For a very small minority it does work but for the majority it does not, and im talking 99% of people. i have looked everywhere for a fix, contacted support with no answer and im writing this to let people know its a waste of money. Steam are conning you, they put this game on their store and it doesnt work. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED  UPDATE: It works for me, but not for some. some computers it works on, some it doesnt. i tried on my relatives nvidia computer, didnt work. tried on my own amd radeon computer at home, it works.",
