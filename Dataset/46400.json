            "review_text": "With your choice of 3 classes(each with different trainable skill sets) you'll embark on a fairly uneventful dungeon crawler through three forgettable locales each with their own distinct mobs. While the classes and builds make for a bit of intrigue you'll quickly be mired in repetition as you clear room after room without much to distinguish each one from the last. In typical crawler fashion the game is broken into three acts each capped by an uninspiring boss encounter. The game also features an incredibly frustrating lack of responsiveness from the controls. Attempts to pivot and free fire are often ignored as you find yourself running directly into damage(and often death) instead. While it had the potential to be a good title there just isn't enough there to warrant the time commitment and achievement collectors will also be disappointed at the absence of any. Unless you are a die hard fan of the genre or have a fetish for poor controls I'd suggest spending your time elsewhere.",

Firing these weapons at the zombies and robots as you uncouver new sectors of an awesome spaceship environment, is a blast for me.  Plus there are checkpoints so I probably play this game 30-45min a day and it fails to cease to amaze me.",

            "review_text": "I recommend Greed: Black Border (GBB) but it's a borderline decision. I recommend it if you feel for a 10h quick action zombie smashing fix! It felt short and I usually spend ages in games like these selling every piece of unwanted loot and backtracking and checking out every corner of every map. So with all of that, I finished GBB in roughly 15h and you might say: 'It's not that bad...' But compare that with many other games where I easily have 80+ hours if not outright in the few hundreds and 15h is short.  Also there is a lack of weapon, armor variety and monster types. So I guess, in general, the game lacked some content. Now maybe, if you continue after beating the end boss (because you can restart the game at a higher difficulty level), maybe do you get new item images for armor and weapons? I'm not sure but I did not feel like doing the campaign again.  I should also mention that because of the way I play, I only assigned some of my skill points, as a ranged damage dealer and finished the game easily on normal difficulty.  With those negative aspects behind, let's look at the positives:  + It's an isometric ARPG (Diablo style) but set in a sci-fi futuristic environment.  + Dropped items are randomized  + Nice environments (maps) and nice unit animations  + Good sounds  Negatives:  - Not enough content  - Lacks a bit of polish  - Not enough replayability  So overall, unforatunately, I have to say that if Mass Effect 1 or 2, Diablo 1 or 2, Company of Heroes 1 or 2, Titan Quest, Path of Exile, Dawn of War 1 or 2, etc. are on sale at around the same price as this title, then buy that other title. These games are each worth about 6 times GBB!",

            "review_text": "Greed: Black Border is too imbalanced in terms of difficulty to recommend.  While the game is beautiful to look at, runs at a great speed despite very intricate pre-rendered and live graphics (the mix of which often causes other ARPGs to get choppy), it's gameplay wildly fluctuates between appreciably challenging and downright diabolically cheap.  It's a shame because at the points in the game the devs get it right, this makes a great play of being a science fiction alternative to other point and click hack and slashers, and makes a very good transition from their predominantly sword based gameplay into gun based action. Effectively, when Greed is good, it is very very good.  This only serves to make the multiple difficulty spikes (actually never mind spikes, cliffs), poorly thought out mobs and insanely cheap sudden deaths all the more frustrating and hard to forgive. The boss fights are next to impossible, and many of the higher level enemies can almost instantly kill you from off screen. Enemies at times seem to shoot you with their highest damage attack from the end of a corridor across an entire map, and in general, the game really forces you to save every time you kill something or suffer the consequences and that really destroys your immersion. To cap this off, there is no enemy respawn or randomised encounter system to enable you to grind until you're too powerful to get cheap-shotted into oblivion during a boss fight or violated into a reload for the cardinal sin of opening the wrong flipping door.   I could forgive the game suddenly going off the deep end without warning over and over if I could've run around doing the equivalent of stabbing rats until I was big and hard enough to not have to worry a la any JRPG you care to mention, but EXP is finite and levelling is painfully slow even on Easy.  I don't mind hard games at all. I have two Ninja Gaiden games and around 50 bullet hells sitting in my games collection, and I've even finished a few of them. I enjoy a well put together challenge. However I cannot stand a schizophrenic, jumpstarting, spiking and above all else, cheap attempt at a challenge. Greed has no balance to it's gameplay at all, veering constantly between laughably easy and nihilistically, keyboard-punchingly difficult with next to no warning, and no amount of high performance, great music (sadly actually FANTASTIC music) or interesting ideas can save it from that one issue.  If you're a hardcore masochist, or you pee EXP and poop cure potions, this might be for you.  But for anyone who doesn't view 200 restarts on the same boss fight because it's got an instant kill homing bullet on STAGE ONE as their idea of fun, avoid.",

The big reason I stopped was because of bugs and problems with the game. First off, after one cutscene the game would not let me move, and clicking and pressing buttons did nothing, even if I pressed escape to the menu. So there I had to restart last checkpoint and it worked the next time. The final straw was when you step in the first checkpoint and it explains that they save your progress, I soon died after in a fire part that didn't make a lot of sense, and it started me all the way back at the start of the level, and I couldn't load the other checkpoint. And for such an apparently boring and uninspired sh!t game, I wasn't going to replay the same exact level for the THIRD time becaus the game has problems and can't work right even after all these years. Also you can't change graphics/difficulty/other settings in game, which is always sooo stupid. 4/10.",

It's supposed to be a traditional action RPG, but in space with guns, but the control scheme it has means you can't move and shoot at the same time. This results in you standing still while clicking on enemies, misclicking, moving, trying to click again, and so on. It screams to let you move and shoot, like every other top-down game with guns.   Add a lack of interesting character building, dark and dull graphics, tactically boring enemies, and you have no reason to play this dreck.",
