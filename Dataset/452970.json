The music fit very nicely and added more emotion to the right parts. BUT.. this game DOES NOT HOLD YOUR HAND, don't expect to get help progressing from the AI or in game text. You will most likely need a walkthrough to get the last endings. At least without going crazy from repitition.. and then the AI agknowledging the fact you're doing it and may be feeling upset about it.",

            "review_text": "Just a small, little 'walking simulator'.  The 'puzzles' (if you can call them that) mostly consist of  'walk here and look at this thing at this particular time and in this particular order' . The narrative is revealed by examining the scenery and in bits and pieces as you go. The game pulls a few tricks on you, such as intentional 'deja vu' loops and whatnot, but it honestly comes off as pretentious more than wholly original. It's also incredibly short if you just keep going until you have pieced together the events of the backstory. It's a nice looking, mildly interesting and very, very short game.  But that's leaving out the gimmick that is quickly becoming the main seling point of the game:  The whole 'white shift' ending .  This is basically the final little piece of the game, and the 'true' ending. It doesn't necessarily reveal anything new that you didn't already know by that point, but is more a reward for participating in a convoluted ( and even more pretentious ) meta-experiment at breaking the 4th wall and incorporating it into a game. I'll be honest; I hate stuff like this. I don't want to be directed to reddit for hints to how many seconds I am supposed to look at a particular wall and stuff like that. It just takes me out of the game and makes me appreciate it less. Some people might enjoy this sort of 'merging realities' kinda stuff, but I just don't. I also don't play Pokémon Go either - and that game does an even better job at blending a game with the real world than this.",
