            "review_text": "Jack is a member of the local force, in a world where downtown is equal to a prison, at least, for the upper citizens, not aware of the reality. However, one day, his pregnant wife got killed in an explosion and he never recovered from that. Now ousted from the force, he's contacted by the same terrorists that need his help. Is what Jack always believed in really the truth?  Return NULL is an episodic adventure game in a dystopian world, where those living downtown are oppressed by the authorities, without really a perspective to survive and with the truth being hidden to the upper citizens (though they can be thrown down to what is described as a prison/jail). The story is interesting as we meet Jack before the death of his wife and after he's ousted from the forces because of the depression that followed. While Jack wants revenge, he's convinced that maybe the truth isn't the truth and is now ready to take down the society he once swore to protect. Everything is centered around plans of a bomb, even in the second episode.  However, I will only concentrate on the first episode as the second is available as a DLC and I will not spoil it. So, this introduction is interesting as you're leading a depressed yet determined Jack in the streets of this upper part of the city, not realizing of what is really happening down there (Jack himself isn't really sure of what to find, even if he knows the truth about it) or being afraid of the local forces, as people are taken and never seen to return.  The gameplay is a point-&amp;-click game: you speak with people, you interact with them, you find items, you solve puzzles. There is nothing extraordinary added to Return NULL on that point and it's working perfectly. However, as it's a game with choices to make, you can expect some impact on the story (nothing really major, apart on the dialogues). It's just the way you will behave with people and how you will blame yourself on your wife's death. Besides, you can be met with a gameover as you have some action in the game.  What I liked in that game is also the graphics. I loved how the characters are depicted in a comic style. However, there is no real animation in the game. You're just in a static background. Jack isn't moving around, you're just pointing on where to go or where to interact and it's done like that, like in a casual adventure/hidden object games.  I also liked the soundtrack. However, there are no voice acting. You just read the dialogues as in a comic book.  I really liked this first episode though I found it short, even if some parts of it seems long (but it's the time taken to find how to solve some parts). It was a good premise for the story to come and for the price, it's not a waste of money - at least, for the first episode. I'm giving you a warning ahead for episode 2: I don't know what happened but it wasn't as good as this one.  I'm still waiting for episode 3 to make a conclusion for the whole series....",
