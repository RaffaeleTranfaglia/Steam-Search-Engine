            "review_text": "I have a hard time recommending this but it has moments when it will blow your mind like no other game can.  This is the ultimate cult game, repellant to all but the most diehard fans of Myst. It's a picture of dysfunctional brilliance that awes the player with it's original ideas but flubs the most basic game design principles. This is a game that you will want to play without a walkthrough but it will likely end up being impossible. Having to resort to the walkthrough really will dampen the fun. There are puzzles in which it assumes the player has beaten Riven (and kept their notes from said Riven playthrough) it actually requires you to have clues/knowledge gleaned from other games to solve a few puzzles.   (spoilers) There are also some rather infamous puzzles in which the effects of your actions don't show up for 15 IN GAME minutes making it difficult to tell what you actually did and there is even one puzzle which can only be solved by standing on a spot and literally being afk for 15 minutes.
