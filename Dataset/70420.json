In fact, the camera angle issues provide a quite insightful perspective about how bad something has to be in order to make a game unplayable. It teaches you your limits of tolerance for certain flaws (e.g. bad graphics, questionable textures, odd monsters you may have seen recycled from/also featuring in Recettear) and scales these grievances nicely from 0 to Chantelise Camera Angles.  It's the kind of game you install, play with the determined mindset that you *will* like it, find you simply can't after an hour, then uninstall. Save yourself the pain. Don't buy this game.",

Dodging is essential in some parts and the game is kind of difficult (don't let the first boss discourage you). Magic is also necessary for the game so you have to learn to not just depend on brute strength. you have to save tons of money to get new items and one wrong move can end it so fast.   If I can be honest, don't buy the game full price, I don't think it's worth that price, and it does go on sale from time to time so just keep an eye out.  I'm just waiting to meet the little girl from Recettear and just lose my sh!t like I did in Recettear (which I also HIGHLY recommend).  BTW can someone tell me if Recettear came before or after this game...I'm just not sure.",

            "review_text": "Chantelise is an adventure game that starrs two sisters name Elise and Chante which how the game got its title by combining both names. Apparently the self proclaim sexiest woman in the universe, Chante was turned into a fairy and her sister, Elise whom you'll be playing as must find the witch that did this and make her reverse the curse.  Gameplay wise, Chantelise is an RPG 3D scrolling type of game. However, there's no exp system. The only way to 'level up' is buying and searching for items. I think the fun factor about this game is to look for the secret treasures. Not only they're fun to obtain, but they could increase your attribute and make the game eaiser.",

            "review_text": "Disclaimer: I have not finished this game yet, so some features and events may not be included here. I'll update it later if necessary. I also have not played Recettear or Fortune Summoners yet, though they are in my library. I decided to play this first because it looked colorful and fun, so this will be from somewhat of an outsider's perspective.  The story concept is pretty simple. You are Elise. Your older sister Chante has been turned into a fairy and you need to find the witch that did it in order to change her back.  Elise is patient and kind, though that's all I can say about her right now, as the story hasn't given her much development yet. Chante is perceptive and clever, but also blunt as a boulder with a one-track mind and a VERY short temper. She makes a lot of threats to kick people in the shins. Granted, she is a foot tall, so that's pretty much as far as her threats can go.  And of course, since Chante is a fairy, her first spoken line is 'Nee nee,' which means 'Hey.' I see what you did there. Fortunately, unlike Navi, she actually respects the player's intelligence with her advice, and it's in a text box in real-time.  As others have said, this game is unforgiving and expects a lot from the player, and the main reasons for that are in the game mechanics, not the enemies.  Let me elaborate.  You do not level up in this game. You have your base stats: HP, attack, defense, magic attack, and magic defense. The only one that you can permanently increase is your HP. The rest are entirely dependent on your equipment. You start with only 3 equipment slots, which increases to 4 later on. These together mean you will be changing your equipment a lot, and there is no quick way to do it. The price of items will also dramatically increase with each purchase, and the price of treasures will slightly decrease with each one you sell. So, while more effective equipment and HP medicines do become available, you will still be quickly limited by cost.   You also do not have skills. You can give yourself different physical attacks with certain crystals, but other than that you will be using magic to do anything other than melee attacks.  You -also- do not have consumable items. The only items you can carry are either to equip or sell. I think the only exception to this is a remedy that cures paralysis, but I haven't bought that, so I don't know how it works. Regardless, you cannot carry recovery items. The only healing items you can get are randomly dropped by monsters or from specific barrels. They don't disappear until you leave the room, but you cannot take them with you. You eat them as soon as you pick them up. Right off the ground. Yum.  You ALSO do not have magic. Your itty-bitty sister does. And she cannot use said magic without gems. You obtain these gems by hitting monsters, and there are four different types, one for each element. You can use them individually or combine up to three of them (only two at first) for different effects. The game tells you some of the combinations in one of the menus, but you'll have to figure most of them out yourself. You can carry a total of six gems.  There are a few problems with this.  The first is which gems you use are entirely dependent on the order in which you pick them up. If you need a fire spell, but you're currently on a wind gem, you'll have to waste that gem or find something else to use it on, because the first gem determines the element of the spell.  The second is which gems are dropped and when is completely random. You cannot choose what spells you use and when. The game does. This is made worse by the fact that there IS actually a healing spell, and it requires THREE water gems.  The third is you will constantly be picking up gems just so you can hit something from a distance. This means a significant amount of time will be spent just managing which gems to pick up and in which order. THIS is made worse by the fact that if you want to have a healing spell in reserve, you are limited to just three gems.  The fourth is that gems are finite in number. If you run out of gems, you have no magic and are stuck with physical attacks. If you cannot progress without magic, you are officially screwed (either through stalemate or suicide) and must start the dungeon over.  The fifth is that enemies have specific elemental affinities to them. You can tell which by what color the reticle is when you are locked onto them. If you hit them with a spell of the same element, you will barely hurt them and thus waste a gem.  The sixth is that you MUST kill every enemy in the room in order to unlock the door to the next room. You only need to do this once, but it is still often easier said than done. On top of that, sometimes the exit is guarded by a giant bomb with several huge magic attacks at its disposal anyway.  The seventh is threefold: skeletons cannot be killed with physical attacks, clams are only vulnerable for the split second they attack if you get close to them, and bombs explode when they die. You can equip elemental crystals to bypass the skeleton problem, and just git gud to deal with clams (usually), but no such luck with bombs. If you have no long-range magic left, you will be forced to take a large chunk of damage to progress, unless you have already cleared the room.  The funny thing is, as I just discovered, giant bombs do negligible damage when they explode. I ran out of magic and had to finish it off with my sword. It did 3 damage. The small bomb I fought next did 31 damage and killed me.  There are a couple problems with melee combat as well. Since the game uses character sprites in a 3D environment (which in itself is bizarre, is this Doom with swords or something?), it's difficult to gauge your proximity to the enemy. On top of that, Chante is not as small as you'd think, and blocks some of your vision. It's usually not a problem, but with small enemies that attack quickly, like piranhas, it can be.  On the topic of enemies: There are only a few types, but each one's behavior and weaknesses are very different, and you fight a significant number at any given time. They also change in element depending on the dungeon. This prevents the game from becoming overly repetitive, despite the fact that you have to restart the entire dungeon from the beginning every time you die.  The bosses, though, can be a problem. Each of them has a specific method to defeat them, and you have to figure it out on your own. Chante gives some hints, but they're entirely from her perspective. She's just as clueless as you. This means you will die several times just trying to figure them out, and have to walk through the entire dungeon again for every rematch. That said, once you figure them out, they can be a lot of fun to fight, especially since the skill ceiling of this game is sky-high.  What doesn't help the repetition is the lack of gameplay variety. You have one character to control, and while your abilities do expand, they never change. There is a point of the game where you control a different character, but they immediately transform into a direct copy of Elise, and so all that changes is her voice and the color of her hair and eyes. That was more than a little disappointing, especially since the character in question USES MAGIC. WHY MUST YOU DO THIS?  *sigh*  Regardless, I still recommend this game to anyone willing to accept all of the above. I just advise you to be patient with it and don't play it for extended periods. You will die a lot. You don't lose anything but your time by dying, but you will die a lot. And hearing Chante trying to get Elise to wake up never stops being a little heartbreaking, especially since she is completely helpless without you.  In short: Prepare to Die.",

            "review_text": "While this game has a cutesy anime style and generally the same likeable 'sisters' as Recettear does, that's pretty much all the fun there is in it.   The gameplay is trite, the controls are, as one of my favorite game reviewers would say, Absolute ♥♥♥♥ On Cheesy Biscuits™, the camera controls even more so, from what I've experienced so far the upgrade market is very limited and pretty linear and the four-way sprite graphics are not made for 360° view.   I've played this for an hour now, and I haven't even made it past the area after the first town. This is mostly because enemies, like Elise, only really attack in the cardinal directions, so when an enemy casts something hurty behind you, odds are already 1:2 it'll hit you, regardless of where you move. This wouldn't be a big issue if you were actually able to sense the attack (OR the enemy, since I'm not watching the damn map when I'm whacking my kunai-sword-thingy at a group of enemies) or the magic would work properly.   Magic attacks a single monster even if it is a raging fireball. The defensive spell is horribly unbalanced compared to the offensive spells as it hardly does damage and disappears after 5 or so hits, which happens fairly quickly as neither the hammer balls need to actually *HIT* the enemy, and a group of 5 monsters counts as 5 hits. It is also not entirely clear when you can get 2 hammer balls. Most of the time the one would replace the other, and sometimes I'd get lucky and there were suddenly two. Luckily this blessing was resolved quickly when I neared another enemy because of the aforementioned AOE on the kinetic items.  Long story short: I want my €2 and the 60 minutes of my life I wasted on this game back. The only good it did was show me the developers took some lessons to heart well when they released Recettear.",

The combat is way too boring to slog through, so I'm not bothering to find out if the story or its characters get any better later on. The entire game is clunky, and a lot of the art and design choices are laughable or cringe-worthy. I was expecting the immediate wit and charm of other Carpe Fulgur titles, but I didn't find it here.

Plus I love the PS1 / early PS2 style graphics just makes me happy!  Story line is interesting but not as memorable as one would hope.",

            "review_text": "Chantelise: The Tale of Two Sisters is a game created by EasyGameStation and released in 2006. It's a hack-and-slash, RPG game, about two sisters, Chante and Elise, or the fairy and the swordmaiden. It combines and adorable style, with a horrible way to play the game. I especially love its story, as it follows the trials and events the two main protagonists need to face. It gives such an RPG-Anime-esque feeling that it makes me want it to become an anime. It's story rich, and has many amazing points. Although some cons are present as well. The game's controls are pretty hard to use, considering, that my controller broke a while back, and playing this with a keyboard doesn't seem to bring back that much enjoyment, at least for me. I have to mention, this game is RIDICULOSLY HARD. There's no possible way of changing the difficulty, or modify it in any way. The game has a pretty annyoying bug as well at the start og the game, making it impossible to progress. It took me 4 new saves to actually get started in the first chapter. If you want to play Dark Souls, but you're like me, and you're a really low budget student, and you like cute thigns more, I recommend this game for you. 8 Euros for this game is actually not enough, but I'm glad, that I got it at a low price anyway. I need to mention, that I'm a sucker for these kind of games. I mean anime girls and swords combined make an amazing game, for me. (I'm a weeaboo, I know, damn it). Never did I feel so weak in my life. Especially after the first damn chapter.",
