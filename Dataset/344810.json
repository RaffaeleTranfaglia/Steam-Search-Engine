The game is very deep and you can use mods to put 'real world' data into it. ewwarehouse.info has a collection of different mods and skins that can be installed. The author is also very good at updating and listening to suggestions to continually make the series better.  ",

You can take over 1 of roughly 30 promotions worldwide, that cater to all the styles of wrestling, as well as promotion levels. Want to take over a WWE style promotion? What about a WCW type in the late 90s? Ring of Honor? ECW? All of the options are there, or you can tweak the style of the promotion manually. AMAZING depth when you run the game with all of or multiple regions; you can pick from US, Japan, Europe, Canada, Mexico, Australia, etc.   Again, anyone who is a loves the business from a high level (just meaning not controlling the wrestlers directly, but nearly everything else), this game is for you.",

            "review_text": "Total Extreme Wrestling is not wrestling game. Instead it is a DEEP simulator about wrestling. If you've had no experience with simulators like Footbal Manager or OOTP Baseball, then be very cautious before purchasing. You might be dissapointed. The other thing to bear in mind is that the presentation is pretty bare bones. There is no music and you don't actually see matches. With that said, the game is actually loads of fun. It puts you in control of your own wrestling promotion and leaves you to your own devices to develop storylines, add titles, create stables, etc. It is incredibly unforgiving for first timers, so plan to spend several hours navigating the menus and getting a handle on how the game works. Once you do though, it's possible to lose countless hours in this game. I definitely recommend this game if you are really in to sims!",

            "review_text": "Good sim.  Quite hard the first few times you play, but once you use your head and take 5 min to learn the subtleties of TEW 2010, it is quite enjoyable.  This edition is much better than the 2013, you can actually create in detail your storyline in opposition to TEW 2013 where you cannot (at least I have not seen how you can do it).  I don't see the point of bringing TEW 2013 on steam since TEW 2010 is a much better sim.  A to buy considering the low low price here.",

I have over a thousand hours in grand strategy games from paradox, and over 300 hours in an early access title called Gear City, which is very much a spreadsheet simulator the way that this game is.   I can't find any way to play this game without a tutorial. I can't imagine it would be impossible for the creators to write one, so I don't really understand why it's absent. I'm willing to power through the clunky UI to the good game beneath it, but I guess I'm just not smart enough. ",

            "review_text": "Text based wrestling management game that rose from free indie roots. The downside with TEW is that the fantasy characters and companies stop you from identifying with them as much as you would if they were based more closely on real-life and it would take far too much effort to re-create rl situations using the inbuilt editor. There are parts of TEW that will seem completely bewildering to all but those who love to tinker with sandbox style software toys and this may put off more of the game's audience than it attracts. Also there is no blow-by-blow comentary with this one (unlike that which can be found in its sister MMA title). Despite these weaknesses, and plenty of room for improvement, TEW is a fine management game that allows the player to express their creativity with very few limits on what kind of show they can make. I just feel that something BETWEEN this slightly convoluted game and it's over simplified counterpart - World of Mixed Martial Arts 3 - would be better than either are currently.  *edit* it should be noted that the '2010' of the title refers to the time-frame WITHIN the fantasy game world rather than anything to do with rl time. The previous title was called 2008 and the only following title is called 2013 (not sure why but it is not available on steam)",
