    "description": "Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved is a old school style shooter, but remixed for the 21st century with next generation graphics and deep, modern gameplay. Playing is simple: you are a geometric &quot;ship&quot; trapped in a grid world, facing off against waves of deadly wanderers, snakes, and repulsars.",

            "review_text": "TLDR: This is an arcade-esque twin stick shooter. It's worth the $4, but you'll need a controller to play it right.  This game was a launch title for the Xbox 360 when it first launched in 2005. Yet due to its simplicity still holds up today. Take control of a shape as you shoot other shapes in hopes to get as high of a score as possible. But beware as the waves of enemies get bigger and faster the longer you stay alive. It's a test not only of dexterity, but also of endurance. While this version lacks the retro mode the 360 version had, it's not really that much of an oversight as the Evolved mode will still have you hooked. You may play in small doses, but it's a game you'll be coming back to again and again and again and again and again and again and again.  Should you buy this: Yes, but ONLY if you have a controller. It's a twin stick shooter, so that should go without saying. You could theoretically play this with a mouse and keyboard, but just because you can doesn't mean you should. If you have Windows 8/10 you can hook up an Xbox One controller and it instantly hooks up.  Worth: $4 is a fair price, although you can usually get about a dollar off if you wait until it goes on sale (it doesn't happen often though)",

            "review_text": "This game has a simple premise: you simply move your ship around, and shoot at the baddies, quite similar to that old game Asteroids. Geometry Wars starts off easy, but once you hit around 10000 points, it really starts picking up and getting harder. There are two weapon upgrades you get, that alternate every 10000 points. A rapid fire machine gun thing, and wide shot. You also have a bomb that can kill all enemies on the screen at once. Yes, you will need to use it. There are many varieties of enemies, from the type that simply float around, to big long snakes that you have to hit in the head to kill, to those green squares that continually try to ram you and are smart enough to dodge your fire. It is a beautiful game: all retro graphics, with very nice anti-aliasing and wonderful multi-color explosions. I strongly recommend purchasing this game if you love a fast paced arcade-style game, with wonderful visuals, and brilliant 'just one more try' game play. LordWildMan score: 5/5",

The gameplay is great, it's a arcade style retro asteroids gone 3 demensional. But the ending really sucks, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off boomerang get's gang banged by a pack of enraged circles and everyone blows up(Stephen hawkings latest book explains how this moment was the big bang), this all lead's into to the sequel Tempest(1981) where they never explained how the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off boomerang comes back to life, I can only assume it's a retelling of Jesus rising from the dead.  0 out of 5 it didnt even teach me how to draw shapes.",

Who knows how long I played part 2 either.. Part 2 is shinny and had more modes to play BUT this is the best version. Period. Geometry Wars 1 is the only game I ever knew that would case me to shake from exctment when passing a high score. When I first started playing it my hands would lock up painfully (think they called it claw hand or crab hand lol) but once it passed I was right back at it.   I've uploaded a video on youtube of me getting all 12 achievments (xbox version) in one run WITHOUT using bombs. Basically that means scoring 1 million points without dieing and not fireing a shot for the first 60 seconds.. Needless to say its a fun game. I am BroodingTom from xbox live and I'm ranked #1 in king mode in GW2 for 2 years now and held 1st in Evolved for about a year too but lost that rank cause I quite playing.  I recommend this game to ANYONE! It takes a while to seperate the 2 sticks (gamepad) and learn the enemy behaviors. But the feeling of mastering a game is like none other game I have ever played! NOTE; scoring anything over 10 million in this game is just a act of endurance really.   I so wish I could play GW Galixies using my xbox gamepad =/ THIS GAME IS SO UNDERRATED!!!! Bizzare Creations was STUPID for naming it after Math...? I mean seriously? This game is the best shooter ever made. Split seconds can mean death. And it can take 6 months to a year to master. (depends on the player)  Also, the true game dosn't begin untill 3-4 million points.  ~Tom",

What I want is Galaxies version which is only for Wii and 3DS.  However.... I decided to give it a shot. Unfortunetly, the game frequenlty crashed my computer every time I started it, led to non-responsable condition, not even with ctrl+alt+del command. I had to reboot my computer after failed troubleshooting. I managed to get it running but crashed after I changed resolution back to my perferred settings. Fixes approved by players or other sources don't help much. I had no choices but requested a refund. The trouble isnt worth my two dollars...  Bizarre Creations, the creator of Geometry Wars arcade series, no longer existed to keep the games alive.  My advice for you: Look up the 'Geometry Wars' clones created by indies like Waves or Gran Vitreous. They are better and compatible with today's computers. Go for them.",

It is an exciting shooter, but the graphics, sound and music are a bit too flashy (literally) to me.  A mildly recommended rating, great as a casual time-killer.
