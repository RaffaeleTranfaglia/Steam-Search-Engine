            "review_text": "Second game of Time Mysteries Series. This time you are a girl raised alone try to discover her family's secret and the evil ancient specter that battled merlin long ago.   Another needle in the hay stack hidden object game with quite good graphics and sound. The small side puzzle game of this game are not that well explained some time. (Like the last water pipe puzzle. You have to not only connect point A to point B but also make sure there are no water leaking on open pipes.)  Still a very enjoyable game with interesting story, animation and wonderful voice acting.   Difficulty is a bit harder than the first game. Achievements are quite straight forward. I messed up on a few things so a quick replay should solve it and 100% in a few hours.   8.5/10... A must play game for hidden object lover and puzzle solver.",

Due to some very hard (for the genre) obstacles, it's not a great candidate for  Babby's First HoG . Other AM games like the  Nightmares from the Deep  series would be a better start.   Note: I don't have gameplay hours or achievements here as my experience with this game wasn't acquired playing it on this Steam account.",

Especially the main character is much more likable. The voice acting is much better but does still get a bit hammy here and there. It has a bonus story, which feels a bit random.  The minigames have still no description and I found myself skipping one or two when I couldn't figure out what the end result was supposed to be. I tend to loose interest in those cases.  All in all, watching Artifex Mundi mature as designers through this series was very interesting in itself.",

Pros - The concept of time travelling to find and solve clues is great! - The artwork, as always, is good (not the best in this game but still looks nice) - The story seemed like it would be interesting from what I played so far.  Cons - The worst culprit by far is the female narrator. She drove me nuts! She narrates what is happening to her like she is reading the weather and it's going to be sunny all day. Not convincing at all and I couldn't even click through the narrative to shut her up (she really needs shutting up). - The HOS seemed too cluttered (yeah, I know they're supposed to be) to the point where I struggled sometimes to distinguish one shape from another. - The time travel tool gives you a ! which indicates an area you can explore/solve a clue next, but I got to the stage where there were no ! anywhere and for the life of me, I couldn't find the last item I needed to progress. I even consulted a Bigfish guide but gave up when I couldn't find a solution.  Sorry, Artifex Mundi. I love and have played most of your other games but this one is not your best.   Hala xxx  P.S. Please don't use the same female narrator again. She was awful :(",
