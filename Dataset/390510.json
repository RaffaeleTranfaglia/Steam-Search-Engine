You have just seized power after a bloody coup and your intentions are to stay in power as long as you can, to rip this country off, transfer the money to your secret Swiss bank account and of course, stay alive and...",

This is mainly a puzzle game where you need to play off factions against each other until you run out of money. Contrary to what others have said, it really has nothing in common with Tropico, not even mood. I got it for less than a dollar. It’s not a rip-off, but there are better games on the Web for free.  If you’re interested in a more serious game of this type, you might look up Hidden Agenda, from 1988, which is not currently on Steam. That’s probably the “retro” game the developers were talking about.",

Game's okay, it's like playing democracy, except much simpler. Adjust taxes, spending expenses, etc. I could not save (bug) any games as saving will cause it to crash. Even when I got it at a discount of less than $5, I would still say it's only worth &lt; $3 as there's not much aspects to it.",
