            "review_text": "A $5.00 dollar game that will get you about 5 hours of gameplay.  Titanis is a side scrolling, 2D action RPG, where your character progresses from left to right, blasting enemies and collecting gold, throughout a variety of missions. Each mission has a side objective (find an item, kill an enemy) and a main objective, which usually entails getting to the end of the stage and fighting a gauntlet of enemies, or clearing out a series of large enemies through the level.   The art style is nice, and colorful; very easy on the eyes. The music is fine, and suits the game.  The meat of the game comes from the customization. You can acquire 16 diffferent skills but can only have a loadout of four at one time. Each one is unique, whether it offers damage, protection, or causes status effects on enemies. As you collect gold, you can buy upgrades to your health, damage, and more.   Even spending a little less then an hour farming gold to finish all the upgrades it didn't take me too long to get through this. All the achievements are easy, save the two for defeating bosses with no damage. There is also a hidden achievement, but I'm not sure what it entails.   This game is recommended. There are worse things to spend your money on.",
