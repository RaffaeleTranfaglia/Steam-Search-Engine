            "review_text": "A 3/5 for this one I think. I was a big fan of Motherload back in 'the day', and this version brought around some refreshing nostalgia of digging holes and turning in ores. A few new features peaked my interest, and I managed to get through to the ending within a couple of sessions.  Up sides were that the game seemed pretty polished, and I feel I missed out by only playing solo. The story had me interested as I delved deeper, intrigued to see how it developed. As a resources hoarder in other similar games, I was given ample ability to hoard and upgrade to my heart's content.  The downside however was that 'developed' seems to be a word that was a little lacking in the game as a whole. The ending seemed half baked, and I couldn't help but feel like the interesting item combining system basically devolved into a much simpler mechanic than it could have been. I didn't feel that mentally exercised by it, and my early hopes were left feeling a bit flat.  Overall, if you enjoyed Motherload as a casual time killer, this will probably give you the nostalgia you're hoping for. Otherwise however, don't expect to get much more than an afternoon or two out of this before it joins your other 'I'll play this if I'm bored' titles in your steam library.  Also, being totally petty... I kinda miss the different names for upgrades (ruby drill, diamond drill etc), this version having a 'it's this many levels good at digging' alternative.",

            "review_text": "A very fun and enjoyable upgraded version of the original 2D flash game. This game is nothing like Minecraft, it feels a lot more like SteamWorld Dig. You just dig, deeper and deeper, farming money to pay for fuel and upgrades, wondering what you're gonna find under your feet. It's never boring because you always find something to try and before you realize you have done every possible achievement.",

            "review_text": "This game and amazing and has a worthy price. It shows once again how great Xgen is.  How the game Improves The game improves in numerous ways besides removing death from running out of fuel. (Still on of the best improvements) The new smelter and combo feature just made the game feel more fun. Now instead of just digging up random minerals, It makes you want to dig up minerals in a certain order, as well has harvest chains of minerals. Speaking of which, the ground isn't exactly random anymore. Now you can somtimes find caverns, whole motherloads of resources, tunnels making different shapes, and puzzles. Yes, there are now puzzles. You can sometimes find special areas with valuable resources that are blocked by a puzzle, which you must solve by bombing it a certain way. This made the game have much more to it then just digging. But you can't just carelessly bomb the puzzle to get to the center. Instead you get more bomb types. Bombs can also be made underground while mining. The world feels much deeper than the last game. To solve this there are now underground stations to make mining easier. No more long trips back to the surface!   Story: Im not supprised that the story is much better because they hired a proffesional comic book writer to do their story. Still, it is fantastic! Much better than having a boss who's name is satan when spelled backwards. LIke the last game you are sent to Mars. This time you are working for the Solaris corporation in an alternate cold war era as the minerals have almost run out on Earth. Within the first year of business, connection with Earth was lost after it was sabatoged by rouge miners. The story progresses as you dig deeper with fully voice acted transmissions. I can't say much from here because I don't want to spoil it.   Graphics: Don't be turned off at the fact that this game is 2d. The artwork is beautiful and full of color. Also at 1080p and at 60 fps! Also, Mars is actually red this time!  Anything bad?  There aren't to many issues. There arent really any that get in the way of gameplay. First I felt that it was confusing to try and start new games and switch characters but mabye that was just me. Second, I had issue's with the key configurations. I wanted to swith movement to WASD. Everytime when I would open the game again, the keys would'nt save. It was a bit annoying to keep switching everytime I would start. When It comes to the game, I just felt like the game progressed a bit to fast. I also felt some upgrades were insanely expensive. But thats pretty much it.  Final thoughts. Xgen did a very good job at the sequel. It improves in so many ways and has so much more meaning. It's very well suiting for their console launch. I doesn't hurt to buy this game, it's worth it 9.5/10",

The ones who played the original flash game Motherload will not be disappointed by this new version, with graphics, upgrades, minerals, improvements and multiplayer content as pure as Diamond. Even if the game gives hours of gaming for repeating the games and the proceduress, the multiplayer mode gives lots of fun, and the Extreme mode is definitely challenging... if not IMPOSSIBLE. A strange for the newbies, a big old classic for the hardcore gamers, a game that runs on all the machines. Fun gameplay, low price, a entire Motherload... OF FUN.",

Couch co-op is really nice as well, as it's always more fun when you can play with your friends and be able to punch them when they die with full cargo of gems.  All in all Super Motherload feels complete, it have everything that should be in it, spirit of original is strong, I'm unable to point out any issues with it.

The story is interesting and the new elements such as bombs make this game really good. When you start out everything is easy and you can just mine away but as you reach lower levels making sure you know where to place bombs is very important. The story can be confusing, but i like it. They could have added some gameplay tips, but you can find everything you need in the menu. I had to discover that myself and i first found out late into the game. I have yet to complete it because the boss is quite hard. Theres a multiple choice ending (all i will say to not destroy any of the story for you).  If you want a good solid and addicting game. This is the game for you. If you have played miniclips famous Motherload game, then it will bring back a lot of memorys. It has a lot of changes to the original.   To summarize my experince of the game, 9/10.   Also fantastic job on the soundtrack, its an indie electronic style and fits perfectly to the rest of the games theme.  To add a couple of things. I recommend a game controller like a xbox controller or similar to get a few things like vibrations and easier maneuvering.   ",

            "review_text": "Super Motherload is a game about mining.  The essential mechanics of the game should be familiar to anyone who’s played a mining game before: collect ore, sell for cash, use cash to upgrade miner. Collect even more ore… rinse and repeat.  Usually this process is addictive enough to compel your average gamer to play until the miner is maxed out, but Super Motherload dresses this in slick 2D graphics, 80s Communist era charm and an intriguing story which develops via a series of increasingly ominous transmissions from the bowels of Mars. While the focus remains on mining, the story and the quests that it brings does add a welcome alternative motivator and rewards you at the end with what I consider to be one of the more interesting and bizarre encounters of recent gaming memory.  Unless you’re playing in Hard-core (which is ridiculously stressful and difficult), for the most part the game is rather forgiving: death is mere short delay on your quest to wealth. The exception for me was the final checkpoint which I found too far from the finale to be any fun – instead ending up with a little too much ‘grinding’ (pun intended!) for my taste. Hard-core gamers may disagree.  The co-operative multi-player allows for up to four players. You and up to three friends can either pool your resources and strategies to help each other out... or bicker and race each other to the Motherload. This turns a good game into a great one, so if you’re buying a copy make sure you get copies for your friends too.  Overall, Super Motherload is a great way to ‘sink’ a few hours and have legal fun with your friends for a few £s. What’s not to like?",

            "review_text": "I find this game soothing; I can simply prospect endlessly without worrying about anything else, solving small puzzles and thrilling in my material wealth. For fans of the original Motherload, there's a Hardcore mode where the original death penalty for running out of fuel is still imposed. If you're expecting that, the game might seem easy to you; for example, in normal mode there's no need for teleportation to the surface beyond convienence rather than the thing that will save your life. The smelting feature adds a layer of complexity to my mining, as do the puzzles. Minding my order and making sure to leave space to pick up ore in the correct sequence to make new compounds does make the mining more interesting and less of a slog than it was in the flash game. My only real complaint thus far is the apparent lack of an inventory screen. I would like to see what ore I've collected, what upgrades I've outfitted my vessel with, and what quantifiable difference the upgrade made (I particularly miss the measurement of the cargo bay. I'd prefer the game tell me how big my new cargo bay is rather than me trying to count how many pieces of ore I've collected until I hit 'Cargo Bay Full'). I would especially like some sort of reminder of what was the last piece of ore I collected. For example, say I'm trying to make White Gold. If I forget whether I've picked up the bronze or just the silver, then I won't know whether I should go grab that piece of gold or now. Or, suppose you have a diamond sitting in there that you've forgotten about, and you pick an emerald to collect before an amazonite. Now you have a much-less-valuable green diamond instead of the blue diamond you could have had.",

Super motherload is a lovely sequal and it feels if like there is so much more added such as the ability to make alloys, more interesting upgrade scheme, 'quests', etc. Slightly different story but completely different vibe (not finished yet as of the posting of this review, but I'm getting close!). I love seeing all the things it has in common with the older game, but also all the new stuff! Played motherload and thinking of buying super motherload? Go for it!  Never played it and wounder if this game is worth it? well personally I think it's unique.

            "review_text": "I have not died once playing this game so far.  the graphics, music and overall presentation is actually stunning, and the controls are really smooth and nice, but it all falls apart on one single mistake; when you're out of fuel, nothing happens.   In the original web browser game, an empty fuel tank resulted in death, which meant that going deeper to find more valuable resources was riskier, but more rewarding for the player. Now, all that happens is that your spaceship/drilling machine just goes a bit slower than usual and you cant mine anymore until you fill your tank again. You could die from taking to much damage by slamming to hard into the walls, but even that suffers from this puzzling game designing choice.  In the original game, an almost empty tank meant time pressure, which resulted in that you had to get faster to the surface in order to not die, while still managing to not kill yourself my slamming into walls as you go faster. Here, that element is completely gone! You can take all the time you want in the world to be as careful as you like, which make everything a slow paced uninteresting grindfest.   Its truly sad, that this one little mistake of leaving this mechanic out just completely breaks an otherwise fantastic remake of the original. As ive already said the graphics are awesome, and hints to a soviet union space rocket type of style and the warm red against the cold green are excellent use of color palette. The soundtrack is also really nice and marries the estethics and story into a great feeling game. I highly suggest that the developers release an update where the empty-tank-death mechanic has been reimplemented, as i see here that im not the only one complaining about it. Couldnt be to hard to do could it?",
