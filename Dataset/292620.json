            "review_text": "Pressured is a deliciously addictive mathematical puzzle game. The premise is simple - add the numbers on the grid together to match the target number. Easy enough at first but you have to be quick because the numbers you need fade in and out, bombs appear instead of numbers and you are not allowed to use the same sums twice, all the while the clock is ticking! What makes Pressured so addictive though is the arithmetic required is pretty basic but the targets get larger and larger and larger, which means you'll need more and more numbers in your sums then throw some multipliers in... it'll test your limits! It's a killer combination of fast reflexes, quick thinking and of course a bit of luck that'll keep you coming back for more. Move over Sudoku, there is a new kid on the block!",

It requires you to think and uses simplistic math and logic in your choices while working against the clock. It takes more than a couple times through the sequence to get the hang of it. It has 14 unlocks and 3 different modes of play. I unlocked normal mode so far and only have 2 unlocks so far and haven't unlocked the story mode. It's on steam sale right now for 29 cents and has trading cards! See if you can beat it!",

            "review_text": "Worse than Bad Rats.  The game Pressured consists entirely of clicking constantly changing numbers, causing them to add up to a target sum. Each level will give you a target number that you have to reach five times before proceeding on to the next level, which just raises the target sum a little bit and repeats the process. Pressure will build up over the course of the game and will lower every time you reach the sum. Basically, you just click and add numbers over and over again to unlock a boring storyline.  The game's appearance isn't polished at all and actually bothers my eyes to look at. The fizzing static behind the fading numbers doesn't make them any easier to see and the pressure gauge is so tiny I forgot to look at it most of the time, not that it was a problem since the game was so terribly simple that I never needed to pay attention to it. For a lot of other people, the game is way too quick for them even on easy mode because of how hard it is to keep track of the fading, fizzy numbers.  The music is horrible and repetitive. If you don't shut it off in the first thirty minutes of game time, I applaud you.  However, there is one positive. This game is really only useful for the cards. If buying the game on sale for ~$0.29 like I did, the cards pay for the game itself. Otherwise, I wouldn't even pay $3 for it. This game wouldn't even be worth playing if it were a free flash game.",

At times unreadable, particularly at the pace of the game, it adds a dimenson of difficulty that exists outside the scope of the game's rules themself. Aside from that, its a unique and fun puzzle concept. Fix the font and touch up the pressure meter(thermometer) to stand out more and you'd have a winner.",
