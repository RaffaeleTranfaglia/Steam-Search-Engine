            "review_text": "Sadly this was ONCE a good game I would have been happy to support financially. However, it has started using questionable practices as a business. For a while I decided to simply not purchase anything in game and hoped that those in charge would get the message as fewer people used their software. However, recently, an update installed that broke the camel's back. Software known as Akamai netcient or some such tried to force install itself onto my computer when I tried to use the client. It was caught by my compter's security thankfully and was blocked. Upon looking further it sends bandwidth and your computer data in a peer to peer network. This is HIGHLY questionable and furthermore a major breach to your computer's security. They have recently stopped using Akamai netclient though I still do not like how they choose to gouge customers for money since they literally cannot find any quests after about level 10 since they require you to buy access to the content. However, if you go for a subscription then it is likely a fun game, though only if you wish to use a subscription plan and get access to all the features and zones.  Just checked it again. Turns out they went back to using Akamei. If you value your computer's security, AVOID TURBINE LIKE THE PLAGUE!!!",

            "review_text": "I started to play this game in 2009 at that time it was Dungeons and Dragons Eberron Unlimited. I played it quiet a long time approximately 1000+ hours. We started with bunch of friends for fun but then all of a sudden it became serious we were addicted this game was amazing, we cleared lots of dungeons had the best items, paid for some expansions. After a long time i started to play it again and with a fresh ideas. My review is short and simple as always.    PROs: -Gameplay is amazing. -Dungeons are really detailed and great. -Leveling system and classes are different than usual but its better in most ways.  -Quests are good and not boring. -You can create really good Builds with a fantastic skill tree system -It's a game to play with a group friends. (for me the solo is a little boring) not just for fun because in lots of dungeons you need different classes and roles to have the most of it.   CONs -The graphic are getting old and decent for our time. -There is a lot of, i mean A LOT OF, 'paid' content like expansions, character slots, classes, races... goes on.  -It's not a free world there is only cities , towns to roam, shop etc. and dungeons (instances) for some action. -Not too much players: Population is really low. -The game is dying and perhaps nearly dead.  It's a wholla lotta different gamplay experience. I recommend this game. I love this game. it has a different place for me. I suggest you to play it (if possible play it with some friends), experience it, than its all your decision to like it or not.   Have Fun!",

            "review_text": "I enjoyed this game for 4 years. I loved its combat system, instanced dungeons and social focus.  However, the game has taken a turn for the worst.  tl;dr Money is basically irrelevant unless you have a lot of it. Difficulty is meaningless. Either you can solo elite or your build isn't viable. Difficulty takes the form of giving the mobs more stats instead of actual meaningful difficulty.   Pros: - Fun for groups. - Innovative true reincarnation system. - Multiclassing and build planning is fun. - Still updating.  Neutral: - Grindy but not bad. If you know how to do the dungeon, it takes 3-10 minutes to complete it and you normally do it 3/5 times minimum, 10 times maximum. - True reincarnation adds to the grind.  Cons: - Might as well be a subscription game. You hit a brick wall at level 14 unless you're spending money. Or grinding for favor. - Very strict definition of what is viable, especially in the newer dungeons and at high level. - It's a dying game. Hard to find groups if you're not at the high levels. - Not recommended unless you have a premade group that plays regularly. - Regularly bugged. Not too intrusive, but not recommended if you don't have patience. - Updates aren't fixing the problem.",

As a dungeons and dragons game, it has several races and classes to choose from and at each level you can choose class and skills, similar to the 3rd edition(s) of dungeons and dragons. I found the gameplay smooth and controls easy to use. Quests were entertaining and I liked exlporing the city. The quests are all instanced so you don't have to compete, though you can take a party of adventurers. When my friends weren't available, I found content that I could manage by myself or with one of the game's hirelings (AI helper). There is some content that you don't get with the free to play - extra races, some dungeon areas, and a few classes - but there is still plenty of content to keep you interested all the way to highest levels. I do note that PVP was very limited - only in special arenas in the taverns (bar fights). Graphics are excellent. As expected in D&amp;D, there are tons of spells, equipment, monster types, etc. Stealth and lockpicking are included and work well.",

Theres quite a few classes (16 if i remember right) that you can chose from which fall into 4 main categories. you have stealth range warrior and mage essentially. It is however very instanced but the load time isnt to bad even for low spec pcs. Each weapon is strong agenst specific enemys such as blades being ineffective agenst skeletons but maces are and vice versa for undead. If your looking for a game thats fun to quest grind and etc in this is the game for you. It gets even more fun when you get a whole guild in an area. It makes you feel very powerfull. There are plenty of toutorials to help you through the game so i would highly suggest at least trying it. If its not for you then whatever you just had a bit of fun and passed some time!",

            "review_text": "Okay, so I'll be the first to admit that this is not the MMO for everyone. It is rather dated, has a few issues once in a while, and lacks some of the quality of life features of some newer MMO's. However, it is a character builder's dream, with the ability to endlessly tinker with various builds and classes and the freedom to build your character however you want, with stats, skills, and feats freely allocated allowing for clever and unique builds for those who want to try something new and impressive optimization for power gamers. The community is by and large decent, and while there are probably a few bad apples, I haven't had any terrible experiences. The game is both solo and party friendly, and the more recalcitrant solo players can bring along hirelings, AI companions, to help out if the going gets tough. Dungeons can be run on four difficulties, a pansy mode for cowardly weaklings, a normal mode for weaklings, a hard mode for regular players, and expert for power builds! (Okay, I generalized there.) There is a lot of content for free, and subscribing unlocks access to most of the content for a monthly fee. Otherwise, you can buy or earn turbine points to get content packs to expand your experience. The cash shop is prevalent and offers advantages, but free to play is sufficient to get a good start in the game and there's not really a crippling disadvantage to free players that would force them to pay.",

All the versatility of the tabletop format is right here at your fingertips. You want to customize your stats and feats to build the most critical to form shield &amp; sword knight, emphasizing value of honor and virtue, or become a shadow walker with deft fingers and mythic ability? You can. In fact, you can be both at the same time!  Multiclass? Yes, please!

Pffft... not if the game paid me! DDO is the closest experience to the tabletop format as you can possibly get, without actually drawing up a world yourself.

            "review_text": "Let me start this off by saying I've played this game for far longer than my playtime says. In fact, it was one of the first PC games I ever played, and to this day it's still one of my favorites. The world is interesting, the diversity of spells and abilities you can get is astounding, and it boasts the unique (so far as I know) feature of calculating stats and damage like an actual game of tabletop D&amp;D. You even get a couple Dungeon Masters narrating the things you do, which I always thought was a nice touch. The sixteen-odd classes, with the ability to multiclass up to three times, and various races are each fairly intriguing, though there isn't really much you can do in the way of customization. Still, you can play as a magic robot. That's pretty cool. The graphics are definitely showing their age, and I've run into my fair share of bugs, but it's never stopped me from having a good time. Still, the game is far from perfect, and there's a few pieces of advice I'd like to give to those interested in picking it up:  1. Get some friends to play with you. This game is fine on its own, but, as with tabletop D&amp;D, a couple friends makes it far better. The playerbase for this game is fairly small, and public groups arent' as common as they once were. If you want to co-op, chances are you'll have to seek outside help.  2. Be prepared to spend money. Not on items, or gear, or things like that, but on adventure packs. This game isn't pay-to-win (how could it be, it's mostly co-op), but you do have to pay for a great deal of content. This can either be in the form of a subscription (I don't know how much that is exactly), or for adventure packs, for which you use TP, the game's freemium currency, to unlock specific quest chains. For some people, that might be an instant turn-off, but if you're like me and have trouble sticking to one game for too long, You'll probably appreciate the ability to pay as you go, rather than keep shelling out money for a game you may not be interested in at the moment. You can, as with most games, go through and unlock all of the areas for free eventually, but not unless you're willing to endure a rather long grind. I'm talking like multiple characters on multiple servers long. If you're not quite sure if you're willing to spend money on a free-to-play game, there's still enough free stuff to get a feel for if you like the game, and you can still have plenty of fun without spending a cent.  Also, not sure if this is on my end or something with the game, but I've found the controls to be a tad slow and unresponsive as of late. Again, not sure if this is the game, or my computer, I've had similar problems in a few other games. To conclude, not a bad game, if you like D&amp;D you'll probably like this. Really I'm just writing this in the hopes of keeping it alive.",

DDO remains the best online MMO experience using the D&amp;D 3rd edition ruleset, and is really a great experience, despite the fact that it show it's age. However....after it went F2P it developed increasingly elaborate monetary systems, weird crafting rules and lots of freemiu options that often felt necessary but weere very costly unless a sale was on. If you prefer soloing or can't find players....a real problem at times....then you need to spend money on henchmen, too; the game is more balanced now than ever for solo play compared to when it started, but forget trying to go it alone without a healer, for example.   DDO is not perfect, and it's aged badly, and I dislike the cash shop's excessive prices (I never bought something if it wasn't on sale as a rule) but it's still an innovative MMORPG and the best such type of game D&amp;D has ever been translated in to.",

First off, Subscription, it's optional, without it you get a fairly decent game, filled with things you can't do because you won't give them money. So why buy a subscription? You get to waste your savings getting fictional currency, an exp boost and one or two classes which are free after some months of subscription, 99 dollars per year. Turbine Points! The exciting piece, to get 23k Turbine points, it costs 200 dollars!(199.99) About 128 pounds according to Google. Rediculous, as The Druid class costs 1.3k turbine points, and to play as a half orc costs about the same, About 7 other classes and 3 other races also cost the same. You can only make 4 characters, or pay 600 points for another slot, this can be done 30 times. The store is rediculous, blizzard are expensive in selling mounts for real money, but they don't come any where near the quantity of stuff these guys are smoking *Cough* Selling. 200-500 points For companions, which do nothing except follow you, Just like in WoW, but these cost money. You can only change their name once, or have to pay money to do so again. Finally, it's very pay to win(Or Lose at life), you can buy experience and stat points to improve your character, becoming immensely overpowered, the more money you put into it. You can also buy the in game currency, in a much more direct way than you can on WoW nowadays. This game is terrible, I don't recommend it, the graphics aren't anything special, especially considering it's only 9 years old and WoW is 10.

One Sad thing was when they put in flying ships, as a guild thing. Why could we not just get an odenaryship, no we have to sky high with flying ships the Gary Gygax way. So I stop play this really good D&amp;D game that follows the rule set.",

I love that this takes D&amp;D to a new level. You can actually play without friends because you can find others online to play with you with the LFG feature OR play with friends and have a blast solving puzzles and slicing enemies.  My recommendation to people new to the game like I was, but familiar with D&amp;D: do NOT follow the pre-built path. Build your own. It will help you so much in the long run as the computer generated paths tend to put your points in the wrong things.   Make your own mistakes rather than letting a computer do it for you. This game is amazing, I would highly recommend paying for some of the features. The subscription is no worse than subscribing for any other MMO.",

No waiting in line for a mob respawn. - Every Instance has 4 to 5 different difficult settings. From Solo to EPIC. In hard mode and above you cant regenerate health and mana. A fail means you have to start the whole quest again. So every moment is exiting. - This game uses ALOT of the original Paper and Pen rules (with some exceptions). - Complex crafting system. - Demonweb Pits as a raid instance!!!  downside:  - 'Free to play'...uh not really. Quests do cost money if you want to do them after a certain level. But if you like it, I recommend going for the subscription. - When you like to play on hard (like me) you will have problems without a rogue in your group. The traps REALLY hurt. I wiped alot stepping in traps. - graphics a re a bit out of date. But on the upper side it has some really creative things. Just have a look at the Phiarlan Area at night. Beautiful",
