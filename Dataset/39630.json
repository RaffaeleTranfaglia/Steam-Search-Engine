I still think the storyline is great. Maybe it wouldn't be so great if not for all the characters. This is a fascinating game, with a very interesting world. It's not all just float here, shoot this, there's a lot of dialogue between missions, all of it fully voiced, and a lot of it talks about things like life underwater, among other things.  I don't know, I just find the conversations in this game entertaining in the extreme. Maybe that's just me. I love this game and it was totally worth buying again, since it's still a lot of fun. Blowing enemy ships to bits is just too satisfying.",

Constant errors, crashes and glitches that were never present in the original game. It seems like any time I play an older game through steam it is plagued with errors like the steam code is broken.  So that issue aside, it is a great game...just be prepared for it to crash every hour or so...save constantly.",

I would love to see a game like this done with todays tech and gaming engines.  Not sure what the price is while you are reading this as I got it in a Humble Bundle but if its more then $10 I would buy something else as this is just out of date. Anything under $10 you can consider it. I mean heck, I got several hours of fun out of it.",

It is normal some angry school kids, who L2P games where you do random shi*!! who don't know old games, because old school games never dies.  Respect (Massive Development) those who made this game on (KRASS) Engine. 10/10 ... and aquanox fans, gamers or thoes who played back in time in 2001, will understand what im say :) .. this game is good and Aquanox 2 is also very good, for 2003, 'DAT' game was awsome, graphic was amaizing!!

            "review_text": "Pros: .Fairly pretty for an old game, despite its age. .Soundtrack is hectic and enjoyable, if a bit repetitive. .Blowing up enemy craft is satisfying and fun enough to keep one playing. .Giant tentacle monsters are cool.  Cons .Most light-craft enemies are almost impossible to hit, kiting your shots endlessly and zooming around outside of your vision.  .Torpedoes are a joke, a bad joke. While 1-hit KO'ing most enemies, their targeting is terrible. One often has to resort to firing even high-end torpedoes at point-blank range; despite this, they will often veer off at the last moment. It is a small mercy that enemy rockets are almost as bad at hitting you.  .Auto-lose conditions. Aquanox has DOZENS of missions to the tune of 'protect the transport' or 'kill the target before time runs out'. Dealing with veritable sh*t storms of enemy craft over and over again because you couldn't blow them up fast enough to protect your mark is the pinnacle of frustration.  .Incomprehensible story. The story of Aquanox is vague, at best. Add to this the frankly atrocious voice acting and sound balance so bad one often can't hear characters over background music, and you'll find yourself skipping most dialogue.  Final thoughts: Aquanox is one of the most frustrating games I have ever played. I saw it through to the end on the promise of giant sea monsters, though not without suffering puke-inducing rage brought on by endless escort missions. While it's great blowing up easier-to-hit craft, the sheer annoyance of most of the story campaign kills the fun factor.",

I think it's the last time I buy an old game EVER, every time there is something that doesn't work well and keeps me from enjoying it.  Also it seems like they forced EVERY actor in the game to act as badly as they can, because it's clearly impossible to hire not a single good one the the lot. And they did put a lot of dialogues so it was clearly something important...",
