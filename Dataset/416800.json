            "review_text": "Escape From The Planet of The Poultroid, developed by Guys From Andromeda, is, to put it lightly, a Five Night’s at Freddy’s clone. Only this time, you’re not the night watchmen at a children’s pizzeria, but a Space Ranger by the name of Cluck Yegger. Crash landed on the industrial planet of his arch nemesis, Colonel Zanderz, Cluck must remain on the planet for seven days before his ship’s engines can reach full capacity. Each night, however, he must survive the constant threat of Zanderz’s mutated chicken monsters.   As mentioned before, Escape From The Planet of The Poultroid is an FNAF clone. You’ll have a variety of security cameras to monitor, doors to open and close and lights to flicker on and off, all the while maintaining battery power… sound familiar? So, gameplay is pretty much identical between both titles.   However, Escape From The Planet of The Poultroid is clearly aimed towards a younger audience. The scenery and monsters aren’t nearly as sinister as other horror titles and the game has a humorous tinge to it. Thing is… it’s not very funny. The voice actor behind Cluck is trying WAY too hard to be Patrick Warburton, who some of you may know as Joe from Family Guy, and his audio logs between nights may crack a smile outta your kid, if anything.   The game’s managed to get me with a few jump scares, and I’ll give it credit for that, but there’s such a lack of dread to it. There’s no nail-biting tension or crazy build up, they just seem to happen without rhyme or reason.  Gameplay is solid for the most part, but one thing is seriously hindering the experience: Almost every ten seconds or so, your monitors will be bombarded by static. This happens so often and so frequently, that I don’t have time to spot the monster before the screen goes white. It’s stupidly annoying. Apart from a minor mechanic where you can stun the monsters with high-powered lights, there’s nothing new to see here.   As of this review’s posting, I’m only on night five, but I still plan on beating the game. Seeing as how they’re only asking for 3 bucks, feel free to give it a shot if you're a fan of FNAF or games like it. But don’t expect anything too special from Escape From The Planet of The Poultroid.",
