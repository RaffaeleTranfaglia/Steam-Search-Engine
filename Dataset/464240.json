            "review_text": "Pretty predictable but fun game. Has a few different scenarios depending on your actions. Only 3 chapters and about 3 hours of gameplay but there is some replay value for achievements and different endings for each chapter. I would love to see some DLC or even a second game with new chapters and new characters. This game is definitely worth the $5 if you like detective games/books/movies.",
