A bit too long for my taste, but just ignore the story and take it as a relaxing break between longer games. Initially gets hard quickly, until you realize you forgot to buy power-ups, and then it gets on the easy side of the genre. No real flaws though. Story is just a pretext. Jazz music is a plus for this kind of game. Heroin is cute. Also pretext. Reviewer speaking in short sentences. What happe..ning. To me. Help. Glglgl.",

            "review_text": "Seems fun for awhile, but gets repetative in a bad way. Buying upgrades seems like it's an after thought, and not well planned. Was able to buy every upgrade in the first 20% of the game, money had no other purpose after that. Achievement tied to doing perfect on a level, but the level ends when you meet the goals, regardless of if you could finish clearing the board. Mindless fun if you're bored of regular solitaire, but not really worth it in the long run.",
