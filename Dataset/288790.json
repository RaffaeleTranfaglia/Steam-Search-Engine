Every single time I've gone back into this game to continue where I left off an error stating 'your previous save file was corrupt. You will need to start over' comes up. Unless they fix this error I would not suggest purchasing this game. They really need to fix this bug as it's not fair to those who buy it to have to restart the game from the start everytime it's opened.",
