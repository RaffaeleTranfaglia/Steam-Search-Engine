An overshadowed gem by those loud shooters at the market, a detailed setting unlike ever seen before with probably more than a dozen inspirations of various literary works.  A very gothic, victorian, medieval-like city drowned in crime and sin - It's a glorious landmark of how to make a non-shooter game engaging. Pretty revolutionary for 1998. Everybody owes it to himself to play this if you are even remotely into good story and stealth which the new Thief 2014 probably didn't handle with the same production quality.

            "review_text": "This game is an absolute masterpiece. There are reasons why this game is an absolute classic, and it's definitely worth your time. Don't be discouraged by the dated graphics, this game is amazing. It's fun, it's immersive, and sometimes it even manages to be scary. It's probably one of my favorite games of all time. However, I would STRONGLY recommend you use TFix to play, installation is easy and it adds a lot of necessary tweaks and support/compatiblity for modern machines.  *Some of my particular highlights* +The level design is absolutely fantastic. Maps are massive, multilevelled, layered, and complicated. While this is occasionally somewhat frustrating in some cases as the maps become difficult to navigate (such as The Lost City and The Haunted Cathedral) the sheer magnitude of the maps is impressive and fun to explore on its own. The levels also vary greatly. One level has you stealing a sword from a mansion, and things get psychedelic the higher you ascend until you finally reach the sword in question. The next map is one of my all time favorites: a journey through a closed down section of The City that was subject to years of neglect after an invasion by a horde of undead, leaving the Old Quarter literally falling apart and haunted by zombies and the spirits of the undead, particularly the Hammerites that died fighting them. The sound design in this level is SPECTACULAR, and hugely contributes to the amazing atmosphere of the whole level. The main sounds you hear throughout the map are the moans of the undead as they wander through the streets, the ceaseless whispers of the Apparitions patrolling nearby, and Garrett's loud footsteps. Not to mention this odd, loud, ethereal hum in the background that you hear throughout most of the Old Quarter. In general all the little effects like that add up to an atmosphere of pure uneasiness and loneliness that is often genuinely spooky. It's one of my favorite levels from any game.  +The game has some other features that are incredibly impressive for the time, and it encourages creativity (and sometimes needs a level of creativity to progress). Botch the job and get caught by a guard that you have to kill? Wash away the blood with a water arrow. See something wooden above you? Shoot a rope arrow into it to try climbing upward. Find a hallway with some torches that's too bright? Put the torches out with some water arrows. Going down a loud stone hallway? Use a moss arrow to make a soft carpet that masks your footsteps.  +The game is, surprisingly, very immersive. The sound design is very good, and the occasional music cues and tracks that play are fitting for the areas. With how vast and well designed the maps are, the game has a tendency to draw you in and keep you playing for hours at a time.  +As dark (no pun intended) as the game is, it's still got a sense of humor. The guards are drunk fools, peering into the shadows, completely oblivious you're merely _inches_ away while they shout things like 'I'll find you, you taffer!' Garrett is a wisecracking cynic as well, making numerous sarcastic remarks as he essentially robs people blind right under their nose.",

            "review_text": "Thief Gold puts you in the role of Garrett, a master thief and former member of the Keepers. As a thief, your main concern is stealing, and this game does a magnificent job at making you feel like you're the master rogue himself, slipping from shadow to shadow as you make your way through the 15 exhilarating and sometimes terrifying locations that the game has to offer.   You are dropped into a huge, open ended area, ranging from colossal mansions to a large labyrinth of underground sewers, full to the brim with every kind of imaginable loot. What stands between you and your prize are a wide array of guards and creatures, patrolling the perilous corridors and walkways. How you get to your destination, is up to you, and Garret's wide arsenal of different arrows and gadgets make every playthrough potentially different.   The City is dark, gritty, and immerses the player into an abnormal world, bridled by cults and sects which give the game life, giving it a particularly paranormal feeling not seen in any other game. The gameplay itself is close to being absolutely flawless, making use of the revolutionary 'Dark Engine', with great AI and magnificent stealth mechanics.   Thief: the Dark Project started what is, in my opinion, the best video game franchise to ever exist. It is the first, and arguably the best entry in this series and is nothing short of an absolute masterpiece. An exceptionally terrific game, that is not to be missed by veterans and newcomers to the stealth genre.",

Today, stealth is about stalking in the shadows and taking out your enemies with ease. You can slit their throats, take them down with a expertly placed arrow to the spine, whatever you want. But stealth back then was about environment more than anything. One of the reasons that the Thief franchise was so beloved is the immersive effect on the world. Everyone who has played the game will recall moments of standing in the shadows and having a curious guard creep over to them like a teacher who suspects you having a pocket knife. and then they move their torso around like an action figure and say 'IS THAT THEE????' get it",

Everything around you is there to reveal and/or find and kill you. Awesome Steampunk(some modern machines in otherwise medieval setting) atmosphere and world-building. Few but incredible gadgets, like a rope arrow and flashbangs. Tense and challenging. Solid story, yet non-linear game-play, well-balanced. Exploration of themes of the disciplined, science-driven and controlled versus the chaotic, natural and unpredictable. Addictive.  Cons: Survival horror elements are out of place, though fun. Graphics weren't even good when it came out.  My recommendation: Into stealth? Play this. Not mincing words.",

            "review_text": "Note: This game can be very troubling to play on modern systems. It's ideal that you download a fan-patch known as T-Fix before playing, as it will fix several issues, including limited resolution options and missing cutscenes. The patch also allows you to download some enhanced texture packs among other things, but they are optional. Pros +Game should run well on any modern computer, but you'll probably need TFix to ease several issues. +Plays like a true stealth game, with emphasis on staying out of sight and excellent light and sound mechanics that work perfectly with this genre.  +Voice acting is superb, and the dialouge is witty as well. +Non-linear levels allow you to take on missions as you choose, and enhance replay value.  Cons -The game actually holds up quite well, but the style of the cutscenes are laughably dated. Thankfully you can skip them.   Overall As the first 3D stealth game (it was released a few months before Metal Gear Solid), it's easy to see why it made such an impact in the genre. The focus on staying in the dark and moving silently, while also discouraging but not preventing combat, is just perfect for a game like this. I got it for free on Amazon thanks to a contest for the recent reboot of this series, but I'd say it's well worth the current price here on Steam. ",

Thief GOLD is no walk in the park and is quite challenging. I clocked in about 26 hours and some missions took me 1-2 hours to complete. I had to use a walkthrough and watch youtube videos for some parts because it is easy to get lost! The map system is more like a visual representation of hints and doesn't actually tell you where you are, thus making the levels seem almost maze like. However, the gameplay and atmosphere of Thief totally make up for this. The game is totally immersive and sucks you into it's universe. The gameplay is really simple! You play as a thief, Garrett, and must follow certain objectives to complete a mission like stealing loot for item purchases after the end of each mission. Also, you must sneak around; castles, caves, dungeons, cathedrals, mansions, and med-evil cities without getting caught by guards and monsters. The visuals and controls obviously have shown it's age compared to modern games, but they definitely have charm. I would totally recommend this game!

You visit places ranging from a fortress with religious fanatics, an opera house, a lost city to a mansion which gets weirder and weirder with each floor you go up. I was also surprised that the difficulty settings do not only add enemies, but also provide you with additional objectives to tackle.   My main annoyances were with the size of some areas which are far too big and maze-like. Furthermore, you can easily miss picking up an objective item which either leads you searching for a long time or using a guide for some hints.

Thief introduced some of the most well known stealth mechanics still found today such as light/dark with indicators, leaning to avoid detection, smart AI that listen and search for you, and tools to incapacitate and confuse rather than kill your enemies. Add on top of this a three teired diffculty system that not only increases the number of enemies on the map, but also the objectives you must complete, and the AI's intelligence and ability to detect you and Thief shows us what a true stealth game can be if enough effort is put into design rather than art.",

            "review_text": "If you are a younger fellow looking at this game and thinking, 'I don't get it, why is this game talked about so often? It sucks!' Let me explain a few things to you. For the time this game was created, it was a masterpiece. The reason this is such a well renowned game is because this was the first stealth game to give the player a first-person perspective and was also the first game to introduce light and sound as gameplay mechanics. Thief set the benchmark for all first-person stealth games to come after it (similar to what Ocarina of Time did for action RPGs), which is why it will always be known as one of the best games of all time.  Sound design is great!! This game is best played with headphones. You can hear the heavy-footed guards walking on the other side of doors and you can distinguish between different surfaces which helps for determining where the guard is. Sound echos through hallways as you would expect from these old, large, midievil buildings. Some may complain that the guard's sensitivity to sound is unrealistic, but try to sneak around your house silently. Steps are surprisingly hard to silence.  Light design is spot on. Emphasis is on dark corridors and although you think it may be rediculous that a guard can walk right by you when you are in a dark area and not see you, if you watch a guard walk into that same area, it is quite difficult to see them as well when they are dressed in shiny armor. The main character, Garret, is wearing all black, so it is no wonder they don't see you! That being said, there are moments of super unrealistic AI responses, but these are not so often that you will be bashing your head against the wall at the stupidity. Afterall, this game was made in the 90's.  Sword fighting mechanics are more realistic than most modern games. It may be considered clunky by most, but you try swinging a massive sword! I like that you have to aim where you are blocking rather than just holding the button to block every attack.  Now, on to the poor aspects of the game.  The AI is inconsistent. Sometimes they will be extremely sensitive to things they see and hear and other times they will be oblivious to the majority of these things. You can be fighting an enemy at one end of the hall and the guard at the other end suspects nothing. If they find a dead body they look around for a little bit and then walk away as if nothing is wrong. They also don't respond to doors seemingly magically opening and closing.  Once you pick up an object, you must throw it and cannot place it down carefully with no sound.  Aiming of the bow is also pretty accurate. Although the arrow soars through the air quite slowly, the difficulty in aiming makes it extremely satisfying to land a killing shot with the bow. Anyone who has dabbled in archery can appreciate the realism of this mechanic. However, landing that killing blow is extremely difficult. Guards can take 3-4 arrows to the body and still continue approaching you.  This game is a buy for anyone who has the patience for the issues that have become more apparent to us through time. You should pick up this game if you want to appreciate the game for the time it was created rather than how it stacks up to modern stealth games.",

Sloppy hit detection, cutscenes that don't play (which often contain valuable pointers), unpredictable AI, and disappearing objects sometimes make it a chore to play. However, the good stealth and area depth more than make up for it.",

            "review_text": "CHALLENGE. This game is really hard. I like it, because there was no dumbing down for consoles when games like this were around, which means it's nice and hard. (well, depending hehe). You can get lost, but if you use your brain and study the map, you can 'figure it out'. Make sure to check for secret levers and false panels, hidden passageways, for they more often than not lead to loot or an easy gain.  GAMEPLAY. The more loot that you manage to find in each mission, the more equipment you can buy for the next job; Therein lies the reward for your efforts. Being conceited as I am, I personally like completing the game having killed not a single soul, which is possible to do. However, Garret has a Bow and an array of Arrows at his disposal, if you just can't resist the urge to snipe that unwitting guard!  Timing is everything. You can rush in like a steam train, but that is just not the behaviour of a Master Thief now, is it...Also, if you play on Expert, then you cannot kill anyone, adding a lesson in Master Stealth. Enjoy :)  INTERFACE. The maps are basic handwritten suggestions, aimed at giving you a hint rather than a dumb arrow pointing you the way. The key bindings take a little getting used to. But I am a veteran and I can tell you they ARE easy to get used to. There is free reign on personal key binding. You can save many configurations, depending on how you play. Okay, so the physics are a little rough and ready, but this was the cutting edge of technology and it is all about the stealth. Get used to how the player behaves in the environment and you won't have a problem.  GET IT? If you like games with a real challenge, requiring patience, a game that delivers punishment for idiotic decisions, immersive and scary environments with appropriate abience and music, Levels that are varied and difficult, then the Thief series is certain to please you.    Thief 1: The Dark project (aka; Thief Gold), 10 / 10. Thief 2: The Metal Age 11 / 10. (These two are the two to focus on).  Thief 3: Deadly shadows. (started to stray away from the original themes and level of difficulty, but still close to the originals). 7 / 10  Thief 4: I don't even want to recommend this one. Leave it on the shelf with Call of duty and Assassins Creed if I were you...Sorry, it ain't Thief no more.. 0 / 10",

            "review_text": "Thief Gold is a first person stealth game. Singleplayer only. Released in 1998. It's quite old but you can believe me: It's nice and worth a try.  Graphics: 8/10  It's an old game. So I can't compare it with Crysis 3. The textures and effects are really ok. The most important thing here: They created a really nice atmosphere with textures you would describe nowadays with the word awkward.  Leveldesign: 7/10  Let's split this topic. There are good levels and bad levels. The bad levels are so confusing that I wish I could erase them for good. For our luck these levels are fairly rare. Most levels are really well designed. You have to think and search for the best path in the shadows hoping to not get detected. Sometimes there are more ways to get to the target location. There are plenty of secrets and loot. I admit that sometimes it's extremely hard to find the correct answer to the riddle and the game becomes frustrating. To sum it up: 7/10.  Sound: 5/10  On one hand you have really annoying enemy sounds, on the other hand you can locate the enemies' footsteps and the rest gives you a fitting sound ambience. Music is virtually not existent and not necessarily needed in this genre but I miss it.   Gameplay/Handling/Equipment: 9/10  You are the thief crawling in the shadows. The game wants you to hide and sneak. And I swear you will do it. Otherwise you will have a really bad time playing the game. The enemies are too strong for you to kill them in combat (most of them). You must use the really innovative equipment to take your enemies down and find the best way to infiltrate. But it takes a long time to get used to the controls and 'rules' of the game. For example: Killing people with arrows is nearly impossible except you do it from the shadows (1-shot kill). The same thing with the club. Knock people out with one hit from the back or die after trying to kill your enemy face to face. The most important tool is your bow. Use your rope arrows to climb up, use water arrows to extinguish the torches, use the noise arrow to distract enemies, use moss arrows to silence your steps (etc.).  Enemies/AI: 9/10  Ok - now I have to explain. Nine out of ten is really high. I have to remind you that this game is really old. And it's really amazing that guards don't just ignore dead or sleeping bodies and keep on searching you until they find you. The AI reacts if you miss the shot and I never experienced a real bug. Sometimes the AI has problems with altitude but it's not gamebreaking or noticeable. So for this time: Awesome! BTW.: Most undead are dumb like they are meant to be.  Story: 7/10  It's a nice story with unexpected twists. Some people may have a problem with the fact that the story becomes science fictional and doesn't remain realistic. The voice actors for the characters are really fitting and it will never be boring throughout the game. The best thing is that you can hear Garrett's thoughts which makes the chacacter lively.  Critic summary: 7.5/10   Personal fun rating: 8/10 [very good game]  The game is oldschool and one of the first stealth games. And it deserved the name Thief.. I can recommend the game for genre-fans. One warning: If you don't have patience then this is not your game.  One of my favorites. 31h played (one playthrough). Sadly the replay value is low.",

Levels are huge, exploration is huge (no invisible walls), and the tools/arrows you have are large and varied. Top it up with a spooky, tense soundtrack and you have a real gem.  It's not all great: graphics are ofc 1998, enemy AI isn't perfect (enemies don't notice patrolling guards go missing or torches going out), the Steam version doesn't show cutscenes (which is what Youtube's for), you backtrack a bunch, item menu is a bit clunky, but all these minor setbacks don't stop it from being a great game.

The atmosphere created by the sound, setting, and visuals, all coupled with the tension from knowing at any minute someone might spot and kill you, is unmatched even today for a game like this. There's a real challenge in Thief, especially if you want to play non-lethal. There's multiple routes through each level, and there's no hand-holding, giving the player great freedom of choice, but also making it easy to get lost or stuck. That's really the only negative I can think of.",

            "review_text": "Being a PC game that's the better half of two decades old, my immediate first impression of Thief was that it was very old and very dated. Graphically speaking, it's nothing an N64 couldn't handle, sound-wise, it feels like someone opened a can of stock 'swoosh' sound effects, and after playing it only for a few minutes, I found myself very disappointed indeed. It seemed very bare-bones from the tutorial. There's not even a run button, and the controls are laid out pretty awkwardly. Overall it's hard to jump right in, but then I started to break the surface tension and I realized that underneat the surface of the water was... was a metaphor I'm putting way too much effort into.  As it happens, a lot of what makes Thief old is what makes it good. I think this is best exemplified in the map system, chiefly because it's actually a freaking map. Most games don't give you maps nowadays, they give you radars and blip points and arrows and 'go-here-if-you-want-to-win'-type things. It makes everything feel very soulless; Thief manages to get around this by giving you the bare minimum. It's pretty neat how this is actually how you would imagine Garrett would put a map together. The game gives you the tools to progression, and you have to interpret them. You never quite know what's going to be around the corner. It's a much better approach than 'oh, please, chauffer me to the nearest mundane objective so I can move into your next playground and do the same thing all over again.' Cough, Hitman Absolution, cough.  The amount of effort that has gone into the levels is very nice; it's easy to immerse yourself into the world. You're given a few details and have to fill in the pieces. Sure, it's dated, but at the end of the day it's a hell of a lot better than almost every stealth game released since... since 1971. Yes, I dare say this game is better than Tennis for Two. Couple that with a fantastically snarky protagonist and a nifty steampunk setting and you're left with a stealth game done the way it should be. This game makes Hitman Absolution cry. Get it.",

In this game's case, it was a triangular box with a flip up face that revealed numerous screen shots of the game. Anyway, enough with the nostalgia. You can't go wrong with this game. The story is excellent. The controls are top notch, and the music, sound effects, and voice acting are excellent. Graphics are good given the time period from which the game is from. The art direction is superb being a cross between classic medieval and steam punk. Level objectives can be achieved by taking different routes, and you can increase the difficulty at the beginning of each level to add additional objectives thus increasing replayability. Overall it's a must buy if you are into stealth games, and even if you aren't give it a try. I promise you won't be disappointed.",

They are there, but for some reason, the steam version doesn't want to play them. Google T.Fix or look for it in the guides for this game and that will solve the problem. It's not too hard to download and use.   I didn't like this game at first. I just wandered the streets of the first level and I tried to fight the guards. Then I quit because I was frustrated that I had to start over and I didn't know where to go or that I should save often.  Then I gave it a second chance and remembered it's a stealth game. Customizing the controls helps a lot. This is one of my favorite games now. I actually like the sequel a little better, but this game is still good. It's old and you can count the polygons on just about anything you see in this game, but the story and gameplay are good or at least interesting.  I was chased by guards in a casino. I stopped to spin the roulette things, ran, and I killed myself with a mine I planted.  I tormented a guard by jumping from a ledge to a ladder, making him climb stairs...then I threw a bag of flour (or something) at him and he died.  I knocked out a guard and threw him down a well and killed him. Later I knocked out a different guard and threw him down stairs for fun because the bodies slide funny. I think he survived, but I didn't check. It doesn't seem to matter if kill the guards after you knock them out. I still need to try to kill a guard with the body of another guard.  I was at a point where I hid from everything. I'm now at a point where I will rotate saves and knock out everyone or fight everything...unless it's undead or the final boss, then ♥♥♥♥ that. Especially the zombies and Haunts and you're out of holywater or fire based weapons.  Also this game made me hate monkeys.  The only bad thing I can say about this game is the cutscene thing and that the maps are a little confusing at first so you can get lost if you've never played it. If you don't save or die, it'll restart the whole level unless you can load a save. Also steam will not save your save files if the game is uninstalled or if something happens to your save files. I've had to replay this and the sequel at least twice. I didn't really mind though. It's better than the remake...and cheaper.  also you can kill people with flour bags. Come on.",

It's harder. Why is that a good thing. Well, it's a good thing because if you were a real thief in a heavily aurded area, it would be tough to steal the item of interest. And that's what this game exatley does. A lot people hate the combat in this game because it's too hard. The gaurds take about ten hits before they die. And to me, that's a good thing because thieves don't master in the way of the sword, but in the way of stealing. ombat would be a difficult task for a thief. Well, after all of I've said, I must say that this game is one of my favorite games ever!",

Go somewhere you shouldn't be? Do you want to play a game that had a huge influence on video games design and stood the test of time?  This absolute gem of a stealth game from Looking Glass Studios (who are responsible for games like System Shock and Ultima Underworld) wasn't meant to have stealth mechanics until few months away from the game's release!  It’s one of the first FPS in which you are expected to be quick, sneaky and avoid enemies at all cost and not go guns blazing. This is a brilliant piece of game design.  Amazing sound engine that is more advanced than most of the engines in games today. It runs great on modern hardware thanks to unofficial patch TFix. You simply have to play the game on headphones and turn on OpenAL and EAX. It puts modern games to shame.  The game world has it’s logic and exprects you to follow it. You can’t move through a corridor because you make too much noise walking on the marble floors? Use moss to muffle your steps. You can’t sneak because the room is well lit and the guards will spot you? Use water arrow to put out torches. The path is set out. How you choose to reach the destination is really up to you.  Garret, the game’s protagonist, doesn’t want to save the world. All he wants is to be left alone and get on with his life. He want to use his skills to steal loot. And there’s plenty of it hidden throughout the levels. Without spoiling the plot … Garret and his master thief skills get him into something much bigger than he ever anticipated.  Amazing atmosphere, various items to help you during heists and well designed missions (mansions, cathedral, mines, prison) that can be explored in several different ways. You completed the game? The internet will provide you with multiple fan-made missions that will keep you busy until you pick up … Thief II.  It's simply a masterful game that let's you become a master thief. I can’t imagine what stealth game genre would look like if it weren’t for Looking Glass Studios and their Thief: The Dark Project. I played this game when it was released and having hundreds hours under my belt I can safely say this game is still as immersive now as it was in 1998.  Solid 9/10  ",

There are games, that, as soon as you turn one of them on, you understand - this one is to my liking. Thief is one of such games. I personally become acquainted with the series about 2 or 3 years ago. And from the first part to the third I was absorbed by the game world. To me it was not just the game, but the storyline, that unfolded through all these three series.",
