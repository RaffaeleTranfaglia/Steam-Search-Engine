    "description": "When she woke up, she found herself sitting at the scene of a murder. Her hands were covered by blood and there was a strange body in front of her. As the victim's death was so peculiar, she was treated as a witch and was locked up in a special prison. There are only 2 days before being burnt at the stake.",
