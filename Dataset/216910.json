            "review_text": "The fantasy world earns yet another entry with Focus Home Interactive's Of Orcs and Men, a story of resolve, tolerance, and genocide. Here, humans vie for power at the cost of content tribal cultures to the south. Players take control of a two-person party in which they can focus on stealth and ranged combat or tanky, melee combat.Of Orcs and Men follows Arkail, a short-tempered orc fighter suffering from PTSD, and Styx, the only speaking goblin anyone's ever found. The nefarious humans have decided that their lands simply weren't expansive enough, so they've begun an onslaught on the orc lands. Arkail's chief has entrusted him and a few others with launching covert missions to assassinate the emperor before he enlists the help of the dwarves and elves. A proud and dutiful orc, Arkail sets forth to complete his mission. Along the way, he encounters Styx, a sly goblin who has been paid to guide Arkail on his path.Styx and Arkail appear to be polar opposites at the onset of the story – Styx works for money and has a way with words, while Arkail's principles and loyalty are matched only by his uncontrollable rage. The mature script communicates realistically and tastefully. Our protagonists, despite their differences, work well off of each other, both in how they meet their goals and in how they interact.This third-person action RPG, as stated earlier, follows our two 'greenskins' around narrow corridors, even if the environment calls for spacious arenas. Players can freely switch between the two, though many may find themselves sticking with Styx, since he can stealthily assassinate loitering soldiers and inquisitors using his sneak ability. In this way, many battles can seem like puzzles: how can I optimize my killing potential in order to do less actual fighting?If and when combat begins, the wrecking ball Arkail can choose offensive, defensive, or special abilities. Primarily a melee fighter, Arkail has a rage bar that fills up over time, and if it reaches its threshold, he enters a chaotic mode in which anyone and everyone in his path will be pulverized over the duration of his now-decreasing rage bar – including Styx. Don't get too excited, because special abilities are quite limited, with a few interesting choices that are only unlocked right before the end of the game.Alternatively, offensive and defensive abilities offer a diverse toolbox with which to stab and bash opponents. Upon leveling, new skills can be unlocked, and old ones can be upgraded. When upgrading, two choices are available, and players can only pick one permanently.During almost the entire game, players will find themselves running through long, beautiful caverns or halls for twenty seconds or so, notice that the game is quick saving, and then hit stealth mode to murder a couple of the languid foes ahead. Repeat. Unfortunately, customization is a one-time deal in that most situations can be resolved in much the same way. Thus, much of the game feels like going through the motions, and I could never sit through it for more than a couple hours at a time.That said, Of Orcs and Men at least keeps its environments visually stimulating with countless details and extraordinary graphics. Never before have I been so intrigued by the intricate details on a character's skin. The textures on Arkail's body demand inspection at first, with each dimple, curve, and scar reflecting perfectly in all sorts of lighting with myriad shades. Similarly, leather looks like the real deal with its waxy surface and creases.Since the game follows Arkail and Styx throughout, one might expect expert voice acting from our heroes. Non-playable characters' voice actors, however, are not always up to the task. While I believed almost every word that came out of our orcish allies, I occasionally raised an eyebrow when a sidequestrian spoke. Combat never missed a beat with typical metal-against-metal and piercing sounds maintaining the bubble of immersion. Musically, the use of violins was a welcome change from the standard horn affair one expects from this sort of game.In terms of control, glitchy camera issues reared their head when players chose to fight against a wall. Targeting was a chore as well, since battles could include nearly twenty enemies if players aren't savvy enough with assassination.Of Orcs and Men feels like a missed opportunity. Action RPGs tend to be gameplay-driven rather than story-driven, and this game is no exception. All of the trappings are there: visuals, voice acting, script, likable characters, and novel game design ideas. However, the game falters in its execution of those ideas, and one misstep can mean tumbling down a tall tower. Fortunately, like our stalwart heroes, such a long, hard fall doesn't obliterate the game.",

            "review_text": "This might be my longest review yet so here's a TL;DR: Alright game that probably could've been amazing if it had more development.  Of Orcs And Men is an Action-RPG type game where you get 3 sets of different moves you can use for 2 characters and you can input 4 at a time and they will initiate automatically when you choose who you want to attack. While the gameplay is somewhat unique I can't help but feel most of it is flawed in some way.  Gameplay: One of the biggest problems I had with the game was that you get about 30 different skills that you can choose to unlock as you please, and also assign skill points when you level up, but a good portion of the skills seem to be near useless or have barely noticable results. Throughout most of the game you rely on the goblin, Styx, for the majority of the fights whether you're using the extremely OP stealth mode to take out as many enemies before you have to initiate a fight or having to almost ALWAYS use the 'Armor-piercing' skill since a majority of the enemies get tons of armor that you need to break down. Area of Effect skills also seem to have a bigger priority over every other type of skill. Arkail, the orc, compared to Styx is almost completely useless in most cases if not only to be a hit-sponge distraction to ensure Styx never gets attacked. He can also build up enough rage to go into Berserker mode yet that is entirely useless and often does more harm than good. You also can't see the amount of Dodge/Deflection an enemy has until you're attacking them and you notice they constantly Dodge/Deflect your attacks. In the end the gameplay wasn't horrible but it definitely left a bit of a sour aftertaste with me.  Story(probably spoilers): The story was honestly pretty good. You play from the perspective of an exiled orc who's people are being hunted down and enslaved for the glory of the human empire and you are tasked with killing the Emperor. You're accompanied by the only intelligent Goblin in the world, Styx, who helps you get over the Wall and decides to stay with you for the entire journey. Arkhail has a strong racial bias against Styx in the beginning and Styx is just looking to get paid, but eventually they become good pals after they witness the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ conditions that orc slaves must endure and even witness each other's troubling pasts. They even gain some human allies along the way showing that not everyone supports the orc's enslavement and befriend some mages too. In the end you kill the Emperor, but it was just a trap to turn the elves and dwarves against the orcs as well as make some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ the new Emperor. Then you kill the Emperor again and you kill the super evil, super strong wizard leader of the Inquisition. The last boss was pretty disappointing since it was very easy compared to a lot of other tough fights and the game ends with Arkhail and Styx being happy but now everyone, except the few mages left, is waging war on the dwindling orc race. The voice acting wasn't terrible but it has some very amateur moments and could've used some work. One thing that really surprised me as well was that nearly all the orcs and goblin talked exactly like a human compared to having an odd accent or speaking in strange tones.  Everything else: For a 2012 game the graphics are slightly underwhelming, but it wasn't a big enough problem to make me stop playing. Some areas randomly drop frames quite a bit but the majority of the game was stable. The AI was a bit shoddy at times as well ranging from enemies or even my partner getting stuck on other people or objects in the environment. The music was quite good at some parts, but it wasn't anything special.   Why did I make such a long review for this game? It's not everyday you get a fantasy game where you play as orcs who are on the morally good side and the world is quite different from the typical Tolkien/Warhammer fantasy. Like I said in the beginning, the game had a very promising start but it seems as though there was a major lack of development that set it to be just 'alright' even though the game was published by Focus Home Interactive who has supported a large amount of other games(some being Warhammer based). Of Orcs And Men is definitely worth at least one playthrough and at most ~$10 on sale, but don't go into it expecting anything amazing.",

            "review_text": "I finished this a while back so this isn't as fresh in my memory as it should. Also I have to be honest here, cyanide games are a guilty pleasure of mine. I always think there are some good ideas floating in their games but they don't manage to make the best out of all those ideas. That being said on to the main event.  Gameplay: You play as 2 characters here and you can switch between them at any time once you get the second one. The first is the orc, Arkhail, and the second is the goblin, Styx. Each of them has 3 skill trees in which you can add points to get new abilities or improve an ability in 1 of 2 different ways that adds an effect like stun or lifesteal to that ability . Arkhail has a berserker and a tank tree and the 3rd has some actions that include Styx like throwing him towards enemies and later on when you choose a specialization class(story event) you get some more skills here. Styx has an assassin tree and ranged dagger throwing tree and the 3rd again has combo actions such as throwing a heal potion to Arkhail. These skill trees/wheels also count as stances that give different bonuses. Speaking of potions there are none :P You have to keep your HP up by using skills, items with lifesteal and good planning before going into the fight. Both characters can equip gear that drops or is found in chests and is specific for each character. While there isn't a whole lot of gear each new item you find will be different and sometimes they will be sidegrades instead of upgrades so they can be useful to the build you are using for them. The fights can get rather challenging at times but all of them can be overcome with some good planning. The main thing to take into account is that Arkhail has a rage meter that can build up pretty fast and sends him into berserker mode where he is faster and stronger but you cannot control his actions and he sometimes takes pauses just to roar at the enemies in which time he gets pummeled. It's up to you if you want to go the berserker route and try to survive fights counting on his rage or go the tank way where you can control his rage and diminish with certain skills. Personally I went berserker for Arkhail and assassin for styx with a few skills from the other trees just enough to cover all my bases and it was fine though there were some fights that I had to restart quite a few times. It is by no means an easy game.  Graphics: From a distance they graphics look OK but when the camera zooms in for conversations the textures are really bad and blurry. A high res texture pack would to wonders for the game but I doubt we'll ever see anything like that. There is variety in the locations you go as far as design but the overall color palette is pretty bland with a lot of browns and greys.  Sound: I'm not really good at this part. Thesound seems ok to me but maybe someone with a better ear will tell you differently. The music is good and the volumes are well implemented (as opposed to viking battle of asgard). My only issue here is that half the voice actors are bad. Arkhail and Styx are ok though and it's their banter that you will be hearing for most of the game anyway.  Story: At the beginning the human empire is waging a massive war against all greenskins and is winning. The chief of the clan tasks Arkhail with killing the emperor as to finish the war. Arkhail needs help getting to the emperor so a guide is hired and this is where Styx comes in. From there the story has all sorts of twists and turn, some that you will expect and others that you won't. I really enjoyed the story but what I enjoyed more was Styx. He's just one of those characters that you either love or hate and if you love him you can't get enough of him.  Bottom line: While there could be improvements done to all sorts of things it was an enjoyable RPG that has replay value at least for the way you can customize the play style of the 2 characters. Also take note that a lot of F-bombs are dropped, and I mean a whole lot (just in case you wanna give this to your kids to play and you're worried about that sort of thing).",

            "review_text": "I've had a blast playing through this game, and it's so extremely rare these days for any game to hold my attention for more than an hour. The story was pretty decent, dialogue was fantastic, and I was really attached to both of the main protagonists, since they were very likeable and relatable, despite being of otherworldly descent. Just be warned, there is quite a bit of swearing in the dialogue, but I thought the way it was done was creative. The whole narrative in this game is top notch.  The combat system was fun and strategic, and the battles in general are quite challenging. Since this combat system is quite different to most RPGs, I'd personally suggest to play on Easy mode on the first playthrough, so to get acquainted with it.  The game is quite linear. Most of its levels do tend to be a straight line, which will not appeal to players who like exploration, but I personally didn't mind the linear gameplay, because I enjoyed the story and the gameplay. In addition, you get a lot of sidequests in between. I was particularly impressed with a part of the game where you get to put together a squad and a plan of attack, and each little sidequest in that section actually counted towards it, which made them worth doing.  Also worthy of note is the music. It was lovely to listen to and fit the scenes where it played perfectly.  Overall I loved the game and I think it's very underappreciated. Would definitely recommend it and hope to see more games like this one from the devs behind it.",

            "review_text": "Rating 7/10 Overview: Third Person Tactical RPG  The Good:  + Artistically and technically I thought the graphics were good. Every chapter has a unique atmosphere so the setting never gets repetitive.   + I like playing as an orc and a goblin, it provides a unique twist to an otherwise standard formula seen in so many other fantasy RPGs. Both characters are well written and excellently voice. The relationship between the two is what holds the entire game together.   + Each character has two main skill trees to choose from to fit your play style. Although it becomes pretty apparent that certain skill trees/skills are more powerful and practical than others.    The Average:   The story is decent but never really evolves into anything. The entire premise is explained in the first hour of the game and never deviates. Other than the main characters, no other character is given a lot of dialogue so it becomes hard to care about the villains or side characters.   The first two chapters take a while to complete, both of these chapters have side quests. The other remaining chapters are much shorter making the game have a very uneven pace.   Un-skippable cut scenes. Normally I would consider this very bad, however this game has very little cut scenes and are not very long.   The Bad:  The levels are REALLY linear with the occasional off beaten path that usually leads to a chest. Thus, every level plays out almost exactly the same. Run through a corridor beat down some enemies, rinse and repeat until the end.   The combat is identical to that of Knights of the Old Republic. I hated it back then and I hate it now. You give a series of commands and sit back and watch as the character executes them, keep doing this until all the enemies are dead. The combat is not engaging, gets very repetitive and once you have your favorite skills unlocked gets even more boring.    Conclusion:  Your enjoyment of the game will be largely dependent on how much you enjoy the main characters. It's a decent game given the budget the developers had to work with.  ",

It's dark and secretive befitting the setting.  STORY: Interestingly attractive. At first, because we are all human, we think we get to play the anti-hero; but then, we realize we are actually playing the role of legitamate heroes, attempting to kill the man enslaving your people (though killing inocents still make you evil lol).  CONS:  LANGUAGE: Quite honestly the languae is immediatly offputting and breaks immersion. Having served in the military I am mainly desensitized to foul language and I understand and agree in some games colorful dialouge can inhance the tension or emotion of the scene. But this is basically a twelve year old trying to sound edgy by dropping the F-bomb every other sentence. It doesn't even flow with the characters themselves. It even happens in casual conversations between characters who seem to be friends. It's as if the voice actors who were hire are so stuck on their automatic swearing they couldn't turn it off just to make a game. Where are the antequated euphamisms, or the fantasy twinge on standard words (Frak anyone?), or even just making it more appropriate to the story? When he refered to Styx as vermin in the Orcish tounge that was great, but this school yard 'look at me I give the game a mature rating' edgespeak is just a joke. It isn't offensive, it is annoying.  MECHANICS: As mentioned in several reviews the mechanics are a bit 'meh.' The near time-stop action que is a great idea, but you feel like your character is always 3 actions behind everyone else. Not to mention there is no command for movement when in this menu.  6/10 Get it on sale. ",

STORY------------ it is about a orc by the name of arkail and a goblin named styx(and yes it is the same one from styx: master of shadows). arkail is sent to out to kill the emperor to free his people from slavery and just being killed like dogs. other then what the main story tells you there isnt much back story to inform you, they told you about why arkail was called 'butcher' in just 3mins and why styx is the only smart goblin in the world' again in just a few mins. i can try and sum up the story for you 'clears throat' roid rageing orc and smart ♥♥♥ gablin set out too kill emperor. hit a few road blocks, then orc just solves them with force or goblin gets back stabbed trying to solve them his way. they fail' does a 180 back just to go the opposite way and gets back stabbed. now that i said that it reminds me of the redundancy of narutos storys.  COMBAT---------- it is not vary smooth. you have to either hot key your moves or use what is called the tactical wheel to use any moves. it is rather boring once you get a good set of moves you use, over and over and over again. the steath part isnt vary great, you just move into the area with people and kill them before they see you are arkails 8FT ♥♥♥ where you left him. but the game can get hard i can say that much, if you set it that way.  GRAPHICS------- the over all graphics arent that bad, but seeing how they never make a scene from scrats, just take when you see then make there mouths move. arkails arms are so winde you catch him getting stuck on walls and doors in a few of the cutscene. all you seen about styx is him useing the same 4 motions for the whole game.  LOOT------- there isnt vary much. for a RPG you find the best gear in the first few levels then you are 'set' for the rest of the game. people dont drop stuff you just magicaly get them putt in your inventory when you'find them' you cant loot people after they die. no, what you are looking for is a chest or a rather large bag that is glowing and setting at a dead end on the other side of the map that you need to be at.  LEVELING-------- you level too fast and you dont get much to sink your points into. it isnt tell damn near the end of the game do you get some new skills that are worth more then the ones you start with  REVIEW----------- all in all it isnt a bad game to get when on sale. it has little to no replay value to it. it wont scratch your itch for steath or strait up berserking with a 8FT orc. but the story is what sells it. good luck finding a game that lets you play as one of most fantasy RPG worst nightmares. thats right, im looking at you lord of the rings.

            "review_text": "The short version: This game, overall better than mediocre. The story was interesting; the graphics were fair; the controls were good. 'Of Orcs And Men' had a lot of potential to be a GREAT game, but some of it's bugs and shortcomings bring it down. Nevertheless, I recommend giving it a play-through.  --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---  I will not rehash the concept behind 'Of Orcs And Men'; there are plenty of reviews which lay out the concepts of this title. What will follow is a collection of problems I had with 'Of Orcs And Men'.  Graphics: Character designs for anything that's not a goblin or orc are painfully mediocre. Humans and dogs are bland at best, and many of their animations are very stiff. Shadow quality is poor. Many of the animations, particularly in cut-scenes, can be a bit jittery.  Dialogue: The early game is pretty good. Arkail and Styx were done mostly well throughout the game. Other voice actors are often bland, wooden, or outright BAD. The voice work for the one dwarf in the game is HORRIBLE, sounding as though it may have been 'read' by a computer generated voice... it was THAT BAD!  General Combat: Throughout 'OOAM' you will very often find yourself swarmed by small hordes of enemies. This is great, as it lends to the sense of awesomeness of the protagonists. Many of your combat abilities cause crowd control effects, such as stun, which are often necessary to survive some encounters. While it's understandable for some enemies to be more resistant to these effects than others, there seems to be an anti-CC-lock mechanic in place, which seems to prevent MOST enemies from being stunned more that once or twice. This would be great if it worked both ways! I found in some combats, particularly those with magic-wielding Inquisitors, that the enemy's ability to unerringly CC you can easily lead to your death if one of your characters falls, making it impossible for the conscious character to rouse the unconscious one.  A.I. Combat: Arkail and Styx are a team. You can control either character, and whichever you are not controlling is directed by the A.I. when not given a list of specific commands, or when that list runs out. Additionally, if you are scouting ahead with Styx, and get detected, Arkail will not automatically run to his side to fight with him! This can be particularly tricky if there is a bit of distance between the characters. Opening up the command menu will slow time to a crawl, allowing you to issue commands, but you can only move the characters in real time, and you can't control them both at the same time. This often leads to having to run Styx back to wherever you left Arkail, who will be waiting there with a thumb up his .... Adding to the A.I. combat frustration, stuns and other such crowd control effects used against you will not only interrupt the character while trying to execute a command, it will often clear their command queue, meaning they will not resume the queue once the effect has passed. This can often be detrimental, particularly in cases where you've queued a character to perform a vital self-heal.  A.I. Pathing: There are many points where one character will get stuck and not follow the lead character (especially if you're scouting with Styx.) Additionally, there are a few locations where even the character you're controlling won't respond to a given command due to a pathing problem. What's worse, this often leads to enemies (at least the melee variety) completely ignoring that character and ganging up on the other one. If the 'invisible' character is Arkail, be prepared to watch Styx meet his doom VERY QUICKLY!  Miscellaneous Issues: 1. While the story for 'Of Orcs And Men' is fairly interesting, some of the conversations can be painfully length, especially in a few of the scenarios where you have died (sometimes multiple times) and are forced to repeat a lengthy bit of dialogue. This can be even more obnoxious if the game won't allow you to skip the dialogue. 2. The armor upgrade system is extremely simple, giving every item in the game a single upgrade. What's more, the game does not give you any sort of preview as to how much this will improve an item. At early stages, when trade points are sparse, it can be quite irritating to upgrade an item only to find your currently equipped gear is still better. At later stages, when you have mages who can supposedly 'enhance' your equipment, this could have been made significantly more interesting by adding effects to gear rather than the same enhancements you would get from any other merchant you had dealt with at earlier points. Equipment upgrading was very lackluster. 3. Saving, at later stages in the game, is virtually pointless OR inaccessible, forcing you to rely on autosaves, as you may be forced to soldier on through a series of several combats before the next save. This was particularly obnoxious at the end of the game, as a death with the boss fight would force replaying three or four consecutive combats AND a lengthy, unskippable dialogue scene. 4. Arkail's weapon after loading. It seemed that after every break (quitting the game, and loading it back up at a later time), Arkail's weapon would no longer look like what he had equipped, and would instead look like a simple stick/club. It wasn't until near the end of the game I realized this was because Arkail would somehow unequip his weapon upon reloading the game! This is a minor issue, as you simply have to re-equip his weapon, but this shouldn't even happen in the first place. I also had this happen randomly during play, usually after the occasional cut-scene. 5. At a late point in the game, both Arkail and Styx are each given the choice between two advancement paths which grant access to additional abilities. The game does not give any indication as to what the different advancement paths with grant, so players who are more interested in the abilities they will gain rather than the story reason for selecting a given path will find this lack of insight a bit irritating. 6. Styx is all about stealth, but this option becomes an increasingly less viable option the more the story advances. I found there was almost no point to stealth at the end game. Dogs cannot be assassinated, very few enemies are positioned in ways which allow for stealth kills, and those who are are often extremely weak anyway, so there is not much point to wasting time with sneaking. As a proponent of stealth-based games, I found this highly disappointing. Additionally, the few times where you are forced to play solo as Styx, you are thrust into the combat with no option for approaching with stealth. If you don't build Styx to be tough (focusing on Stamina), this can make for a ludicrously difficult combat.  General Gameplay Weakness: While there are many options available to the player as they advance Styx and Arkail, the best option is to focus on Arkail's defensive abilities and Styx's ranged abilities. Optimally, focusing on Stamina for both these characters will make them extremely tough, and make the game far easier to beat. Essentially, this is the only 'right' way to play, particularly at the higher difficulty settings.  --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---  All that said, the game was very engrossing. When I would play, several hours would easily pass, and I didn't want to stop until I had finished.",

It has a very captivating world with a pretty good mythology, and the two main characters are among the most memorable in any recent game I've played. The relationship between Arkhail and Styx feels very genuine —you really get to care about those two.  The downside: The combat system is quite a bit loose, the AI is stupid. The combat mechanics consist in pausing, choosing targets, queueing attacks and abilities, and constantly switching between Arkhail and Styx, making sure their actions complement each other. It works for the most part but it's not very refined and you can bump into some pretty frustrating moments as a result. The way certain fights are designed doesn't help too much either, and if you leave the AI to make its own decisions (by only focusing on one character, that is), you'll be screwed most of the time. It's far from being unplayable, but I can see these problems turning off a lot of people.  It's a flawed game, but a very charming one. Recommended if you think you can get past the somewhat flimsy combat and you don't mind its linear, basic design.",

Once I got to know the basics of combat, I found the the game very easy to beat by selecting Normal difficulty. If you want a challenge, I would slide it to Hard or Very Hard. You can always change back the difficulty mid-game if you think it's too much.  Especially if you do use Hard mode, there may be a problem: the cut scenes are nice, but they will play again if you die, as you can't save during combat. This means that if you have to repeat some combats, you will have to skip through a crapload of cutscenes to get back to the combat again - I am not exaggerating. This is the biggest flaw in the game.  Replayability is relatively poor. Overall, I did like the game, and I really like the fantasy world the developpers presented us. I played Styx: Master of Shadows before I went for Of Orcs And Men, and I simply love the goblin Styx, and all his genesis. Arkail was a nice character to follow as well.

If you can look behind the game, which is not THAT bad as people claim, you have a solid fun and simple backstory, a good unscrolling of events and for me, one of the best Goblins ever to grace a computer game: STYX. Honestly, for 7$ this game is worth it just to play with Styx and hear his foul-mouthed remarks and puerile retorts. Ark is good, but a bit high and mighty and Warrior Code orc, but Styx is just fun. The combat system is ok and honestly, I just played the game to keep the story going, which entertained me even into the end, with the classic twists and betrayals common to fantasy literature portrayed in the game. Give it a spin while its cheap, or wait for it to come on sale again. I spent 2 days finishing it and gladly enjoyed every minute of it. As a tip make Styx go full Ranged and Ark full Offensive. Combat is a series of actions you spam over and over and can lead to a lot of broken spines and Ark killing Styx when he is in Berzerk mode XD. Invest early in Rez companion skills and just hack away with abandon as the story unfolds, finished in 12 hours in easy mode because all i wanted was to cruise the content and enjoy the Cinematics. Reached level 21 by the end. In retrospective all the skills I used were Styx Aoe Stun Bomb and Arks AOE swings over and over. Gear is kinda sparse so don´t sweat it too much, just upgrade your armor. All in all I would gladly buy part 2 if they ever release it.

Please, save your money and don't buy it. ●▬▬▬▬ஜ۩۞۩ஜ▬▬▬▬●  ×°×★Summary Review★×°× Overall Rating: ★☆☆☆☆ [1/5] Story: ★☆☆☆☆ Gameplay: ★☆☆☆☆ Sound: ★☆☆☆☆ ●▬▬▬▬ஜ۩۞۩ஜ▬▬▬▬● I've tried and tried to give this game a chance, but after 3 hours all I can conclude is that this is a prime example of a great idea gone wrong. Thanks to misguided game-tags this is being sold to players as an 'Action, RPG, Story Rich' title. I'll tell you right now it is none of these things.  First of all, the combat is clunky, even fans of this terrible game will tell you that's true. The combat is slow and strategy based, NOT an action game. Action games are free-flowing with non-stop 'action' like Space Marine, Tomb Raider 2013, and Dragonball Xenoverse. Those are action games, this is not.  And regarding the RPG elements, it's very easy to completely screw yourself if you don't spend your skill points in the right way. If that happens, you'll find yourself at the end of the game unable to finish, forcing you to start all over again, because there's no way to undo your skill points. This completely defeats the purpose of customization, which is the core element of an RPG.  Secondly, the dialog feels like it was writen by a 13 year old trying to sound cool by swearing all the time. Honestly, there's no need for that much cursing. I'm by no means offended by it, it just doesn't feel appropriate to what's going on in the story. And the rest of the dialog is just, well, awful. Nothing about it is immersive.  Story Rich? Really? Who tagged this game with that? Because it's not. The story is nothing more than your basic 'Orcs VS Humans' genre. The original Warcraft had a better story to it than this. Either the developers didn't have a big enough budget to afford decent writers or they just didn't care. However, the end result is the same. A lack-luster experience that left me feeling cheated out of my money. There's no way in hell this game is worth $30. Maybe $9. Maybe. But it would still be awful.",
