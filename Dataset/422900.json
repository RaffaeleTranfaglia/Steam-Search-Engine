Both games will reward players who like to find efficient solutions to tactical problems/puzzles. If you are a casual player, maybe you will enjoy Particle Fleet more. But if you really like to sink your teeth (and your brain) into a game, I think Creeper World 3 offers significantly more value per dollar and per hour of gameplay.",

This is one of those strategy games where you can sink your teeth into every mission and take things at your own pace (for the most part). I pause frequently during the gameplay to re-assess the situation and consider my next moves.  I love that the map has so much going on, with all the particles floating about, but you don't really need to be aware of it all at once. You can take over the map one area at a time (depending on the size of your fleet and your tactical prowess).  The game does have a slightly steeper learning curve than CW. You are given ships that contain modules that aren't fully explained in the tutorials. I recommend reading the Help in the main menu after playing a couple missions so you can digest everything that has been thrown at you.",

            "review_text": "  Having spend more than 40 hours during 2 weeks pre release there is no way this is not going to be a highly recommended game from me.  Not going into details on what the game is about here, just watch some videos or better yet grab the demo from the developers website and see for yourself, but I will say what to expect. A campaign which will introduce you to all the game concepts with a great difficulty curve and storyline which will take you 10-15 hours to complete. Some maps from alpha stages of the game, many featured on the regular videos posted during development, ranging from easy to hard which will give you another 10 hours of gameplay. Mission and ship editors for those who want to get into this and access to maps uploaded by other players, giving infinite possibilities to what you may find. The last game from Knuckle Cracker, Creeper World 3, currently features more than 30000 maps created by users which can be easily sorted using a variety of filters, including some which introduced completely new game modes and where I have spend more than 200 hours, at least half of these playing modes initially never intended by the developer! So far even pre release there are already over 50 user created maps available, and having played a couple of dozen I can say there are already at least a couple of gems in there. And if that is not enough a random mission generator, where you can tweak dozens of different variables to get a customized experience, or just hit 'random everything' and go with a completely random map, which can be anything from a walk in the park to almost impossible to beat.  Disclaimer: Since I´m a big fan of the other Knuckle Cracker games I have been eagerly anticipating the release of this game and following its development through the regularly posted videos and posts on their website. I got a free key on a giveaway from the developer giving access to some people from the community to the later stages of beta to help ensure a smooth launch. That said I haven´t encountered any major issues and the few bugs were being regularly patched as soon as being reported.",

This is a great new take on the creeper world dynamic. I found the learning curve difficult at first but once I caught on it was all about the gameplay. In general creeper world is a genre on its own, although there are parallels to tower defence and perhaps even MOBAs. The combination of resource management and tactics in the creeper world system works well and this is an especially enjoyable game. I recommend it to anyone.",

The long term playability comes from making your own ships in the editor and replaying maps to test your ship theory. The fun comes from finding a way out of a stale-mate with the particles.",

            "review_text": "Awesome game, well recommended. If you liked the creeper world series, this similarly fun to play. Great replay value and the graphics are definitely a whole lot improved since creeper world 3.   For those new to it, the levels in the campaign are usually easy to figure out but the real challenge is in beating the level quickly. So, you can grind it out for an hour or figure out how to do it in a few minutes. This makes the game attractive for casual playing as well as for hard core strategists. To win, you need to optimize strategy and resource usage and make use of all the various strengths and weaknesses of your own and enemy units. What adds fun is that the enemy is beautifully rendered particles that move and cluster in all sorts of complex patterns. It can crowd you and and you counter with guns and armor to overcome it. You beat the game by by taking out particle emitters and gaining control of the energy resources on the map.  With creeper world 3 there have been lots of users that ended up writing new levels and using the built in scripting language to tweak the game dynamics or even introduce new game modes. This game has similar potentia and comes with all the tools to do thisl and there already loads of community maps. You'll do the campaign in about 10-15 hours and then move on to the user provided maps, This is where the real fun starts. These unlock after you complete the first ten levels, which sort of function as a tutorial as well.",

Instead you have a fluid enemy in which you must destroy several spawners. If you have played Creeper world and liked it, then you will enjoy this game. It is a good game, but not a great game, however it is quite cheap, so there is that.  My only complaint is after finishing the story missions, there are some extra scenerio missions. I found them frustrating, especially because the game 'cheats'. For example there is some problematic emitter. You get your fleet near it and you have it locked down. You kill all the partilces it makes as fast as you make them. Then you move in for the kill shot, and then suddenly the emitter cranks out 20x as much as it did before and blows away your entire fleet. Its just stupid and I didn't find those very fun.",

It's got a lot of the same sensitiblities present in the Creeper World games, but it brings enough new ideas and mechanics to be different, resulting in something recognizeable, but fresh.  The story mode seemed relatively short to me, but like previous Knuckle Cracker games, a big draw is the ability to have endless randomized maps and easily accessible community maps. Each map can also use custom ships which can lead to some very nice surprises sometimes.  If you like Creeper World 3, you'll probably enjoy Particle Fleet. If you don't, probably not. Personally I'm sure I'll sink a lot of hours into this.",

            "review_text": "If you've played the Creeper World games, this is similar. The big difference is the de-emphasis on resource gathering and base-building, and a bigger emphasis on battle control. There is a unit limit. You can't win purely off of turtling into a strong economy, you have to turtle into taking objectives here and there.   There is much more emphasis on movement and putting your ships in the right position. The 'creep' can now react to your presence, so you have to pick your battles carefully. Sometimes your full army can only take one objective at a time; sometimes it can take multiple objectives at once.  For those who haven't played creeper world, try the free demo on Kongregate / the interwebs. If you like that kind of slow RTS where you have perfect information and the enemy AI is predictable, you'll probably like this game.",

It could be hardcore too, if you're into those time-attack sort of thing.  PROS:  1. Laid back 2. Design your own ships 3. Infinite replay value from player-made maps  CONS:  1. It does get old after a while 2. Ship design is limited by practicality. Map does not give enough energy for huge builds. You could spend time making a gigantic ship with 30 cannons, but then none of your ships will ever get to fire properly because energy is fixed. 3.

I've played every single creeper world game and can say without a doubt that the gameplay in Particle Fleet is every bit what I expected it to be.   It is very hard to compare it to a game like creeper world 3, which had layers and layers of content, while on release Particle Fleet seems slightly lacking in that department. Particle fleet does have extra missions outside of the main story the same as creeper world 3, but creeper world's bonus content was massive, for better or worse. Not to say this is a bad thing, but it touches on another point about the game I'd like to touch on.  The story in Particle fleet is, without spoiling the epxerience, pleasing to anyone who has played the previous creeper world games, but ultimately left me wanting more, and hoping for the possibility of additional content to answer the many questions the game raises but leaves open.  The gameplay is really where the game shines, even if a lot of other features add to it (like the ship builder or mission editor). Quite a departure from the play style of creeper world, the game is less about ground control and maintaining an all around front line, and more about directed front line pushes. The enemy is no longer fluid in nature, and is more actively aggressive. The creep would roll over you if allowed, and demanded an all around defense of your controled area while being offensive. Particle Fleet plays similarly in some ways, but the particulate are harder to predict and wont hesitate to rush a weakness if they come across it, and unlike creeper world, where you would just push your front line close enough to an emitter to take it out, the particulate are not fond of the player getting in range of the emiter and often demands a large ammount of available firepower be dedicated to defending the laithe ships.  Over all I would say creeper world 3 had the potential to be much more punishingly dificult at times in the story (specifically farbor), but Particle fleet still manages to present a satisfying challenge.  4.5/5, story feels incomplete in the end, gameplay is a fantastic change of pace from creeper world, and while the extra content is lacking compared the the last game by knucklecracker, it is more than enough to be satisfactory and give hours upon hours of entertainment.",
