            "review_text": "Fun and challenging game with AMAZING re-play value. You can choose your path through the game much like FTL. You get random spawns including races and skills. You unlock more races and skills as your characater levels up and there's a ton of flavor and variety in how you can choose to play each run. Some-what like Rogue Legacy without the permanent progression of leveling up your castle or upgrading classes.  The combat is top-down and feels very much like Binding of Isaac with its control pattern and movement style. You can choose what items to buy, what skills to upgrade, what armor sets to complete, what gods to gain favor with to get blessings all allowing every playthrough to feel unique in some way.   A playthrough takes 20-40 minutes. The game also offers a hard-mode and a daily challenge which is the same configuration for all players to race each other against.",

The only iffy part i found about the game was the narration. The tone is reminicent of Dr. Seus which does fit the art style but not much else. Just breaks the immersion a bit when every time exposition is givin I think of The Cat in the Hat. Overall the i give the game a pass.",

This will wake you up with it's LIQUID controls, manipulative STRATEGY, and enticing UNLOCKS.     The beat goes on.   Yeah brother, I've been to outerspace. Bringing it BACK down and UP AGAIN, to give this game a shining FIVE STARS in the ring of it's genre. And that, is macho madness.",

I only play the daily challenges because I like the pace to be faster than the slower normal game.  I guess my only complaint is that it does seem to be missing a bit more in the action-y, combat pace department....I know this game hits a lot of good notes, but the combat is a bit bland and sluggish feeling in some sense.  My complaint will keep it off my top tier arcade list which includes Spelunky &amp; Nuclear Throne (to name two).  You might be thinking, okay he loves it and he won't play it very long??? Wha? I know, right...  Look, it is good, it's solid, it just needs a bit more bite, speed,etc in the actual combat. The devs deserve the money, so I'm happy to support this in hopes for a better sequel.",

If you enjoy top-down roguelikes, this is a great addition to your library. Really looking forward to unlocking more of the content.  My only gripe - while the game handles controllers well (playing on a 360 controller) the menu isn't setup for it. Hopefully they change that in the future.",

            "review_text": "Flamebreak is a top down action RPG that takes some of the best elements from Binding of Isaac, FTL, and MOBAs and combines it into a game that is very fun to play. As of this review I have a little over 30 hours into the game and suspect I will have to log another 50 or so until I experience most of what the game has to offer.  The overworld is similar to FTL in which you move from level to level and if you take too long the shadow (instead of the rebel fleet) will push you towards the end of the level. Combat is very similar to Binding of Isaac only now you have 4 action commands like in a MOBA. You do have the option to purchase additional skills if they appear at a shop in addition to new items, weapons, and armor that boost your stats.  Please note that this game is not a MOBA so please don’t buy it expecting it to be one.  The graphics are pleasant and combined with an amazing soundtrack help to immerse you in the world - the switch from the overworlds music to combat music upon entering a new level helps to get your adrenaline flowing.   The game is very challenging once you start playing on Hard or Nightmare difficulties (the fairy quest challenge in particular was insanely difficult) although Normal will still present a good challenge for new players. Also, thanks to this game being a roguelite, a new world will spawn each time you start a new playthrough giving this game immense replay value.   I strongly recommend this game if you have any interest in roguelites.  ",

If you like the idea of a 'Roge-lite' 'RPG' 'Twin-Stick Shooter' as opposed to a 'Twin-Stick Shooter' 'Arcade-Action' game, then I'd say give it a go.  A nice feature of this game is that it has a number of 'Daily Challenges' and 'Daily Leaderboards' as well.  This game has been a pleasant surprise and instantly recommended. ",
