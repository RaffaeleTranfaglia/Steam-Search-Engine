            "review_text": "this game, oh BOY this game... let me tell you  if you are, like myself, a pansexual weeaboo who thirsts for good dating sims and hot anime sex, this might just be the game for you. disclaimer on my previous statement, there is no actual hardcore nudity in this game so I have no idea why it's tagged that way, and if you are looking for porn then look somewhere else. HOWEVER, this game does get sexual, so don't worry to the fanboys or fangirls or fanpeople who would be dissapointed to not get any of the action. I DIGRESS, anyway so...  STORY  I don't want to spoil anything, but the game description mentions that they are incubi, so like is that really a spoiler? anyway you end up living with five demon boys after a series of unfortunate events, and you can either fall in love with one of them OR, wait for it, DATE ONE OF THE THREE FEMALE ROMANCE OPTIONS?? so remember that when playing it, because even if you aren't aiming for the lesbian love, it could end up that way. on my first run my initial goal was Sam, but somehow I ended up with Diana. I was not disappointed though, becuase I love all the characters in this game.   CHARACTERS  while the boys do sort of appeal to certain tropes, you know, 'smart glasses guy' and 'secret tsundere tough guy' they still have their own personalities, back stories, and problems outside of the trope box. The girls are the same way. I wouldn't say this story taught me any new values or life lessons, or anything 'deep' like that. The characters are 100% likeable and enjoyable and if you are like me, projecting feelings-able.  SEXY STUFF  lot's of talking about the lead up to the moments right before the sex, and then it's like 'and then we had sex'. the sensual descriptions and touchy feely stuff is still hot, but like I said before this game isn't porn. BUT DON'T WORRY BECAUSE HOT DAMN THE SECOND GAME, I'm not going to lie, Sam's route made me have to turn on the air conditioner.  CONCLUSION  great game, personally I think it's worth your time. if you are a weeaboo fangirl, fanboy, fanperson, please play this game. I don't think you'll regret it, probably. unless your Malix, he probably regrets it.",

With a rich cast of characters such as sandwich b*tch, eyebrow bridge, a**hole f**kboi, tryhard flirt, and boring man (AKA a**hole's shadow), this game truly shows beauty in every form.  There are even side characters to choose from, including 'stereotypical lesbian', fluttershy, i-only-showed-up-like-once, and miss boobies!!  And if you don't like any of them? BECOME A DEMON F**KIN LORD!! BECAUSE WHY THE HELL NOT!!! Halfway through, the main character's face just disappears. It just kinda happened  So far we've screwed 2/6 men, and 2/3 girls. it's been wonderful to scream in fear as our ears get molested by 'uh~ uh~~ gahhh~sp~~' if after this ur not convinced to buy it (it's free so why not) then idk what to tell ya buddy   so yeah great game 10/10 would get molested again",

You, creator (Michaela Laws) if you are reading this (not probably)  I love you. Not in that way. I love you for making this great visual novel-romance game.  I did not like visual-novels. And how I said, I did not like. But after I played this lovely novel♥ I needed more. More than this. I am waiting for the second part.  And after all, when you play this game, you enter in a world that you've never entered yet.  And by last. Let me make a little suggestion. Visual anime-novels. Based. In real anime romance series.  That would be awesome. Awesome. Like you Michaela.",

            "review_text": "Well, now that I've achieved all achievements I feel that I should contribute and review this game!  This is the first time I've played a game like this and it was actually a pretty good experience overall, especially since this game was Free-to-Play!   The first thing I noticed and liked about this game was how it has full voice acting! The voices seemed to portray the characters in the game pretty well and provided the player with an immersive experience. But even though overall the voices were a pro for me, there were times when I felt the voices got excessive and annoying but I learned that it can be countered by just disabling the feature or just clicking through the dialogue. Another thing I loved about the game was how each 'romance target' had a different story to tell. There were some overlays in history between the Demon Brothers but overall they each had different reasons for doing the things they did. Also great background music! I found the music pretty catchy in this game (especially the ringtone).  Some things I did not like as much was some of the art, how some parts of the story didn't go into enough detail, and the repetitiveness. Well the characters seemed slightly disproportionate and there were some people in the game that I thought looked like a mutant (the teacher) but I didn't expect too much out of a Free-to-Play game. The creator of the game provided a lot of cut scene art though so even though it wasn't amazing, it still provided players with a source of visual aid for the verbal descriptions and dialogue. So even though not great, still better than nothing at all. Also I felt like the story had the potential to become something better but because of the objective of the game (seduce everybody), everything was just glossed over and never really dug into. I mean at times I just felt information was shot at me and that I never really had the chance to digest it. If the creators went more in depth and explained some of the story, I felt the game would have been even better (I learned there was a sequel so its possible that they'll go more indepth on the story then). Last thing I thought was a con was the repetitiveness of the game. It is kind of to be expected since most of the individual characters' plots touch upon others but I still can't help but find it tedious to read the same thing over and over and over (I'm talking about the parts that aren't skippable but are still the same for almost all the characters (like the pre-ending dialogue.)  Overall Pros: FREE! Voice acting included Background music Interesting story  Cons: Some of the art Not going indepth on story Repetitiveness  Yup~ I would definitely recommend this game to people who are fans of female dating sims, especially since its free. Though there were cons, I felt that they weren't major enough to detract from the game. I was still able to enjoy it when I played through all the routes. Oh yeah! This game has male and female romance targets and not just all-male or all-female so people with different preferences can still enjoy the game.",

            "review_text": "Just so people know this isn't my first otome game. Compared to others I played this scored a C+. The art of the characthers as you intereact with them is beautiful but when you get the gallery art pieces they are completely different level. It threw me off to be honest because I was expecting more. The voice acting wasn't amazing but it was still nice since it was different.  The thing that really threw me off was how the game was very short. Extremely short. Most of the time your time limit is a month to almost a year; whereas, this felt like a few days if not a week. The incubi were extremely boring. Of course there was times when you're like nice thats hot but other times where its overused dialog; and with five of them it gets boring real fast. Your thoughts as you progress courting the incubi is almost always 95% of the time the same. Then when they intereact you at certain points it is also the same with maybe one brother having more like 75% same dialog lines.  The women in my opinion were a better path to take but two of them are still slightly similar. I can see how they still say some things similarly but again your characther's thoughts are again practically the same. Lastly the last male option that is not an incubi was decent but not great.  I got this game for free so I was like why the heck not right? Unfortnately I learned that this game was a kickstarter game. This means that people funded this project to make the game. Usually when I hear kickstarter I expect so much more than what I had gotten.  This game was tedious and a bore to finish but I did just to make sure for this review. I was hoping something would happen to change my mind but no it didn't. Thanks for reading.  SPOILER ALERTSPOILER ALERTSPOILER ALERTSPOILER ALERTSPOILER ALERTSPOILER ALERTSPOILER ALERTSPOILER ALERTSPOILER ALERTSPOILER ALERTSPOILER ALERTSPOILER ALERTSPOILER ALERTSPOILER ALERTSPOILER SPOILER ALERT What I think was really awful was how the incubi were practically infatuated with you so quickly with most of them ending up declaring your love for you. How stupid is that. First of all one of them practically states that as demons they don't understand that emotion as they feed on sexual desire. It just wierd to me. Like honestly a sex demon fell in love with you in practically less than a week. Its like of course he likes you you're the only women hes been talking to stuck in that mansion. Pah. Also there was hint that they have been in the human world way before you met them for at least a while so its like obviously they can't just haven't talked to other women. Plus at least two of them could not have been virgins but obviously your charcther is oblvious to that or is just wishful thinking on her part no matter what information you had been given by them. Her ending thoughts bout how she finishes the game as in to what happens after high school is pathetic. Its almost always the same as in he or she supports me in whatever and that she doesn't know what to do.",

        {
            "review_text": "Where do I even begin to explain how bad this game is?  First, the positives. Your character can date other women. I didn't notice any glaring grammatical errors. It has non-romantic endings that aren't bad ends. The sex scenes are optional.  That's really about it.   Seduce Me  is a game about Mika Anderson, a girl who inherits a house that happens to be filled with sex demons, who greet her by  using mind control to make her okay with them kissing her and stealing her energy.  This is assault. She's a little freaked out by this, but for the most part takes it in stride. I did not take it in stride. I was appalled.  Early in the game, Mika tells Erik, one of the incubi to stop flirting with her, and his response is 'I like beautiful women.' That's harassment (she had JUST said to stop, yet he continued), but it's treated as romantic. Further on in his route, you learn he's such a flirt because   he's petrified of rejection  . This doesn't excuse his behavior at all. She said no.  The incubi (and one human boy) keep touching Mika without consent. This is seen as acceptable, presumably because it's 'gentlemanly' or some other BS. She did not say they could touch her. She does not reciprocate their touch. She is never given an option to say no.  In fact, despite an ACHIEVEMENT called 'it's okay to say no,'  Seduce Me  fails to address healthy consent on even a basic level. To get the 'true end' for the incubi, Mika must always 'keep going,' EXCEPT for where the sex scene is concerned. That's completely missing the point of consent, and undermining 'it's okay to say no.'  Some ways in which this fails are common to all demon routes. For example, Mika is told something is only going to work if she trusts a certain character. Instead of asking the player if Mika trusts him, the incubus whose route you're playing just TELLS Mika to trust him, and so Mika does.  Also, any demon you romance   kills someone in the course of the story. If you romance Diana, it's your  grandfather   . Mika isn't given the option to say she's not okay with that.  The consent issues are most clear in   Diana   and   Damien  's routes. The former talks about consent in sexual relationships as if it's a nice bonus and not a mandatory requirement. And Mika is just okay with that for some reason.   Diana   also mind controls humans, besides and including Mika, just because she can.  The latter is given a chance to earn his heart's desire by   sleeping with Diana  , which Mika opposes.   Damien  's views on this are unclear. Instead of talking this over like adults,   Mika gives Diana the go-ahead to assault him and wipe his memories  . It turns out the whole conflict was engineered anyway, but   Damien is still grateful that she made this decision on his behalf  , for some reason. This is partner abuse.  Besides the multitude of ways in which  Seduce Me  fails to handle consent maturely, there are other problems.  All the GxG routes have issues.   Diana's route, as mentioned above, is full of consent issues, but it's also not actually romantic. It ends with 'Maybe we'd find romance. Maybe not.' Suzu's route reinforces negative stereotypes of Italian-Americans. Naomi's route is generally okay, except for the problems it shares with Suzu's route and the problem all three of the GxG routes share.      Both of the human GxG routes only happen because of Diana's influence. The human GxB route also involves Diana's influence, but there Diana manipulates Mika's father so he'll stop pressuring her, and in the Naomi/Suzu routes the person being manipulated is Naomi/Suzu, respectively. So you only get with a human girl because she's being mind controlled. Additionally, the GxG routes are much harder than the GxB routes save Andrew. You have to go out of your way to end up with a woman, but you can end up with a man just by accident, which, as someone who prefers GxG, is aggravating.    Matthew's childishness is played up far more than it needs to be. I wouldn't have guessed he was an adult, and the text doesn't help you out there, either. People with young faces exist -- I know, I'm one of them. But having a young face, wearing hoodies, and liking cartoons doesn't make me a child, and the same goes for Matthew and his interests.  Overall, I thought this game was terrible, and I only played all the routes to see just how bad it is. Please, do something more productive with your time than playing this game.",

Like, where is this game trying to go? The exposition takes way too long and in the end its like...okay and??? What did all that exposition have to do with anything??? Not to mention all the weird plot threads. I think the game dev should've cut her potential plot threads in half, it just makes the game seem really messy and unorganized. But the wort of all is I didn't feel any feelings whatsoever for any of the characters, which is not a good thing considering this is a DATING simulator. I mean, you don't have to romance any of the characters if you don't want to (which is neat!) but come on, these types of games are so character focused, that if none of the characters are likeable thats a BIG issue. Anyway, this game does have some good things going for it, and it's all around not too bad for a game that is free!

The artstyle isen't the classic big eyed anime look and for me atleast it feels like a releave to have this as a break in that kind of looks from visual novels. The grammar in this game is actually really good. If you can handle the fluttering heart, playing as a character that feels like a fanfiction of something I do not recognize, then this game is one for you. 100 % is not that hard on this, but use a guide. My first end was (So Long, Sweetie. . .). If you want to then tell what your first blind one was.  Have fun, enjoy and keep that doll away from me :)",

For instance, there were some grammatical errors that were overlooked (ex. ending a sentence with a preposition). Also, the voice acting was not the always the greatest, and the character's personalities sometimes didn't match up with what they were saying. Occasionally, the artwork wasn't on par. I felt that Matthew's normal character didn't look the same as the detailed cg artwork. Furthermore, the stories were very similar to each other. Most of the time, exact sentences and sequences were copied from each other.  (As a side note, to get the full story with all the details, you need to play the other stories.)    Keep this in mind, this is my opinion which may differ from yours. I say to everyone take reviews with a grain of salt and experience it yourself. ",

I won’t say its perfect, some of the writing is cringey, and at times the plot is predictable. There were some characters that felt flat, but maybe that was just me. Either way it really is an interesting concept delivered in a just-right-enough way that I can recommend it. That is, if you read the cons I just listed and still feel up for the venture.   I’ll close out this review by just saying my biggest gripe and my biggest praise about the game.  Gripe: Short. Now, albeit I’ve finished very few Visual Novels in my day (most just bore me,) so as far as I know this one could be super long compared to many others, but to me just when things were getting really good my chosen route ended. Yes, I know I can play other routes BUT I DON’T WANT TO CHEAT ON HUSBANDO CUS I’M NOT A HUSSY!  Praise: Voice acting is for the large part excellent. Most characters have very competent, dare I say even professional sounding VA behind them. Not all of them, but enough of them so that this would easily be one of the best things I’ll remember about this game.  ",

I followed it for about 30 minutes (which was about 28 more than my intuition told me), and it was just dire.  This is dirt-cheap game production. I could probably program this, and I'm certainly no expert. But it's a way to pass the time. It could be a lot better. The story is not just utter crap, but the most amateurish writing I've seen in a very long time; elementary-school standard. The characters are absurdly stereotypical. The choices offered to you are few and far between, and seem to have no impact on the storyline at all. Is there any reason why the characters couldn't be personalised? Instead of asking simply what name you want your character to have, why not ask about skin colour? Hair colour? Hair style? Facial features? Straight or gay? Hell, why not ask if you want your character to be male or female, adjusting the story suitably? And given that it's hardly a gripping storyline, why not just cut to the chase and get onto the seduction bit?  Which isn't much of a seduction bit. Why not have a choice about whether your character is going to kiss him or not? And with the kiss, why not have a choice about whether to do it again? push him away? drag him off to a bedroom? do it right there in the foyer with his brothers watching?   This game could be a lot of fun, and seriously filthy! With more frequent choices that actually affected the story, it could have been a lot more entertaining. As it was, it's like a young girl's English homework, with a few pics and sound effects attached by her big brother, who's in a high-school omputer class.  But hell, if you're bored and don't fancy paying out for a new game, it kills time. I wouldn't say anything better than that.",

And hey, it was free, so what was there to lose?  Only roughly five to six hours of time really. Once I started, I really couldn't pull away from the game anymore.   Pros:     Nice art that made me really excited about trying to unlock all of the gallery images (which was relatively easy to figure out)    Interesting characters. Honestly, at first I was worried that they'd be purely stereotypical. You have your charmer, your bad boy, your jester, etc. But the more you play, especially if you follow a specific character's path, the more you learn that they're in fact all a little more multi-dimensional.     The ability to romance male and female characters!  From what I've seen glancing over Otomes so far, it looks like most of them don't offer this option. There's 6 male and 3 female options and I found myself enjoying every one of them.    MC with options. To me it felt like the MC was kinda multi-dimensional as well, depending on your choices. And thank GOD she wasn't just a passive,  I'll just let everything happen to me  character.    Pretty good voice acting. Considering the fact that, as far as I know, they aren't professionals, they did their job really well. I definitely bought the emotions they were portraying.   Cons:     No voice acting for the MC. Some other users stated this too and I honestly agree, it kinda broke immersion to hear everybody speak aside from the MC (and the narration). This does offer the option for the player to better identify with the MC I guess? But to me, I would've preferred a voice actor for her as well.    Slight repetitiveness. With that I mean, in some cases, no matter your choice, the narration will be exactly the same except for a change of names. A little disappointing, but again, this is a free game, I have no idea how high the budget for it was, etc.    Lack of build-up. Don't get me wrong, I really loved the romantic paths, but some of them felt a bit... hard to believe? Oh yes, we've known each other for less than a week but I'm totally in love with you. Ehhh...    Following up the above point, I felt a little rushed sometimes. Kinda wish you could have the romance develop a bit slower and over more time.   Nonetheless, I feel like I might well replay this game sometime in the future -- or just look at the artwork a few more times. While there are some cons, I do feel that the positives outweigh them.  9/10 would play again.      ",

Grab it just for the voice acting bloopers and you won't have wasted the time you spent downloading it.  It's an interesting little story with each ending revealing another chunk that other endings don't reveal. The art is fine. The writing isn't quite polished, I'd say high school level or enthusiastic middle schooler writer level (been there, done that). There was just some awkwardness and poor word choice either for connotation or totally not meaning what the writer thought they meant but it's not cringeworthy. The intimate scenes are still fairly hot despite the amateur writing. The MC can have a varied personality based on your choices, which is refreshing.  The boys, as far as you get to know any except whichever one you go for (if you even go for one of them; you can get with the girls too), are the usual architypes: quiet one, smart/sophisticated one, cutely boyish one, shameless flirt, and finally, the 'bad boy' i.e. a s s h o l e. Unfortunately, the last one is done in a way I just hate. When girls say they like 'bad boys' they DON'T mean they want a guy who treats them like s h i t unless they're alone with him and he reveals his secret sensitive side. Other feminists have gone into better explanation of why this is not good so I won't repeat them.  I was annoyed that a huge section of story branches gets cut off if you make the seemingly arbitrary choice between going out with your friends or staying and fixing up the house with the boys (there's a part later where you can take food to one of the guys, and if you went out then you simply can't find any of them. I think this part should give you a second chance to connect with one, unless the creators wanted to punish you for going 'oh thanks for doing all the work while I go out with my pals, suckers'). I really wish there was an option to get to know each of the boys a bit before picking who to persue. It would fix the somewhat frenetic pacing too.  Save often and make use of the 'skip' function to fast-forward through the stuff you've seen already and you shouldn't waste too much time on the replays. Also, there's a guide to each ending so you don't have to fumble through if you don't want to.  Another peeve is that some of the responses are timed, others aren't, there isn't really much warning when they start GETTING timed, and the countdown bar is almost completely transparent. I would prefer no timed sections (especially the ones where there are something like ten choices to read through and choose one of before the time runs out) but at least make your countdown bar visible. I whiffed the first choice in one conversation not realizing it was counting down until the choices disappeared and the conversation moved on; only then did I see the barely-visible countdown bar.  The voice acting wasn't bad but I feel like it took me out of the story or made me too self-conscious at points so I just turned it off. Like I said before, though, the bloopers are worth the listen.  Overall not as good as something like Magical Diary but for a freebie it has plenty of merit, give it a shot.",

It actually lets you have more control over your character's reactions and personality. Its not corny or predictable. Its actually quite sweet at times and it does a really good job of making a lot of empowering 'girls can be strong' moments where the female lead meets other strong female characters who are in positions of power. Its really a good game and well worth the time you spend playing it. The voice acting was spot on and very varried. I didn't feel like it was amateur voice acting work at all and I really enjoyed it. Well done!  You don't feel like you're being just dragged along with the story. Instead you get to make dialogue choices and main character deicisons on how they react to the situation. Its no 'Telltale Games' decision heavy but for what it is, an otome game, the decisions do feel like they have some weight and its good to have those choices.  I also enjoy that there's always an option to back out of a romance or situation. The frisky scenes are optional and don't alter the game which I think is nice. Overall the game was worth playing and all the CGs are pretty cute. Damien was my favorite character personality so far. I can't wait for the sequel.",

This game has multiple endings, after getting one ending I found myself constantly starting new games to see what endings I could get. The story itself is definitely interesting, not one I have seen before (then again I don't know this is my first visual novel) The characters themselves are definitely unqiue in their own ways and the abilitiy to make your own choices definitely adds to the depth of the characters. I would recommend this game to anyone just looking for a random game to play when they don't know what So; Pros: -Intriguing story -Good voice acting (for the most part) -Artwork is nice -Multiple endings -Interesting characters -Beautiful environments -Good humor bits -Nice soundtrack -Cute anime chicks -And for the girls, there's mainly cute anime boys. I'm not complaining but hey at least the creator gave us guys the girl options. -IMMA SAY THIS RIGHT NOW BUT THERE'S LESBIAN ENDINGS AND THAT'S ♥♥♥♥ING GREAT  Cons: -While the voice acting is good for the most part there are some iffy moments with delivery -Some of the artwork is subpar  -Speaking of voice acting, I would've liked for Mika (protagonist) to have voice actor, I'm somewhat confused that she didn't -Certain content is reused -This is a certain nitpick of mine but I would've liked an option to view the endings you have and tell you which ones you do not have -No sex scene with the hot demon chick :(  I'm still having a lot of fun with this game and I'm looking forward to more content from the creators.

The only issues I have with it is there are parts that that seem to indicate that something will happen or could happen that don't go anywhere and the story lines with non-demon charcters are not very well developed.

As a person who just finished Senior Year High School as well, I feel that, while the teenage characters so far are a bit of a stereotype, they're still very believable. The voice acting is 99% very good, except when you press v for the self-voice. However, it's understandable, as the 'self' is meant to be voiced by yourself to add yourself into the character, and as such I never use it.

The writing is competent and the character cliches feel knowingly-implemented rather than purely lazy.   The most disappointing aspect of it for me was the degree to which the scenes/dialogue are copy-paste for the different incubus routes. Anime cliche characters don't bother me, but reducing them all to nearly the exact same gushy, saccharine dialogue one you're on their romance path does. The boys nominally have different personalities; that should show up in their romances!  Also more than a little jarring to hear an incubus character ♥♥♥♥-shaming a succubus character. No, really.",

            "review_text": "  A visual novel about a female protagonist, who's grandfather's death gives her his mansion in the will. After she moves in, she encounters 5 brothers with mysterious origins.  This is a romance RPG with many, many different endings. I woud nitpick about the lack of action, but in the end, this game boils down to the story. It is strange, but in a charming way. I just love that the entire backstory of the brothers is not known to you unless you do multiple endings, and that this game embraces lesbian enteractions. A minor villain that I felt was going to be there for a long time, was sadly only in the game in 2, very short scenes, though they had a lot of tension. The main villian in the story, however, gave me an uneasy vibe the entire time, to the point where you can't tell if they have good intentions or not. I have done everything the game has to offer(got all the achievements and looked at both bloopers :P), and I can safely say I will be purchasing the sequel to this decent FREE game, somewhere down the line.  7.5/10",

Love, lust, desire, and lots of laughs (especially in the blooper section).  YES - the other reviews you read are correct - there are writing errors... but you know what? The game may have a LOT of errors in grammar, repeated words, and typos -- but the story, characters, re-play value, and funny moments will have you wanting more. Seriously. Forget the small 'imperfections' and enjoy the reality that 'K' has cast before you.   If you are a romantic at heart, love cute boys, magic, demons, choices, acheivements, and the idea of dating royalty - this is a game for you.  It's awesome. Seriously. You will become obsessed.   ...Also... I LOVE JAMES and I need him in my life.",

In my opinion, I think this is a game definitely worth the time and effort to find all the endings.  Everything about the characters and story was appealing, it was almost impossible for me to stop playing this. I had already gotten two endings in the past few hours I've been playing this. I really hope this good work keeps up.",

I will update this as necessary  I think the only thing I am really dissapointed with is how quickly everything happens. It feels like everything way too quickly. There is no down time, and definitly not enough to to build up to being hopelessly in love with anyone.   Over all though, it is not bad for free. I would have been dissapointed if I had paid for this. I did however buy the sequal. I hope that will be better.",

I didn't feel a connection between the main protagonist and her love interest other than kissing them, then falling in love immediately afterwards. And keep in mind this game takes place over the course of only a few days. Some of the romantic scenes ended up being a cut-and-paste of another character's which was lazy and made the characters even less individualistic.  Overall I'd give this game a 5/10.  Pros: -Voice Acting is decent.  -Steam Achievements -Free  Cons:  -Too short  -Cut and Paste Romance scenes -No Character Development  If you want to play a simple dating sim game with attractive guys for a short amount of time, then go for it! But don't expect an amazing story out of it.   ",
