            "review_text": "Great game, needed improvements and the developers worked really fast on them! I'm impressed and hope to see more games from this studio now.  I'm changing my review to a positive because i think these improvements (patch 1.04) will really work but if i may add something...(i know, i know 'chato to caracas!' but i was a tester before ;))  Observations: 1.i think the tweaks you did on the roll option are stopping me from rolling randomly (when i press space and directional key) even though its much more controlled now so well done...i recommend checking if you can roll whenever you want (im playing keyboard so..that might be why). 2.it happened to me a few times that even though i still had a 'full life' (2 hits) i got hit once and died right away (when i die i see the girl shaking in a buggy way by the way, might want to look into the animation there). In Any case here are the POSITIVES:  the new camera at the intro works brilliantly and the 'chase scene' is even more clear now with the camera view from above and much more intuitive as to what needs to be done to delay the chaser.! also i saw you stopped the 'auto walking' thing so BRAVO!  Also love that you increased the lives available as it makes it a lot less frustrating :) (i'm a casual gamer, i get it, i just dont have the time to be hardcore gamer anymore...)  MY ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW (this was with patch1.03 and now most are FIXED with 1.04)   Bought it cause im all for supporting Portuguese gaming efforts, but really this needs improvement still. I liked it but here are my comments for those playing with a keyboard: [FIXED]-camera rotates too fast and does not 'dodge' obstacles (example when crossing a door it goes through the wall frame rather than avoiding it by leaning down and remaining behind the character [FIXED-or at least greatly improved]-difficulty level is 'high'? for a beginner at least i got easily killed [FIXED, as far as i can see] maybe cause the 'roll' option keeps jamming you against objects so i couldnt really avoid those barrels by rolling). [didnt' have to repeat cinematics yet, so didn't see this key]-is there a key to skip cinematics? i just started playing and had to watch the big fat kid by the window turned zombie 4 times cause i couldn't skip it. [FIXED]-character keeps moving even if you're not pressing any keys (suggestion: fix the animation on the character). [FIXED without needing to touch the object animations- as with the new camera this now looks way greater and more intuitive! WELL DONE]-floating objects in the initial running scene first appeared to me as a bug, until i realised thats how they were supposed to be - floating (small suggestion, make them move slightly up and down, left and right or rotating in the air to give the illusion that they are really floating).  Good to see Portugal showing up on the game map once again.",

I really don't know, because for the dozen times I tried to eventually kill all the possessed barrels and briefcases and keep playing the game I failed. The controls are plain bad.. although updated they seem kinda stiff.  Although we swipe 'GoGo', the monsters are only hit on a specific position, and there's no feedback when we hit a monster, why not adding a crash sound? Why the monsters are so hard to kill?  The combat, well, spinning around monsters trying to dodge them and at the same attack them is pretty boring and difficult.  Did not like.",
