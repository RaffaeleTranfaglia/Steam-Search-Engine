I found the story rather interesting, the art style is good (the only thing that bothered me was the lack of different facial expressions, but that’s a pet peeve of mine)… BGM was really good, it fits the story nicely. I also enjoyed the mini games.  But here’s the only flaw on this game: the VA. I’m sorry, but it was awful. Sounded like everyone was just reading the script and that’s it…  5/10. A good quick experience overall! I also think it would be awesome to have a DLC of the soundtrack. =)",

            "review_text": "Finished the visual novel in one hour, around seven chapters long. There's no save function so my recommendation is to either finish this in one sitting or quit the game - to take a break or do something else - after one chapter finished.  Overall, I can appreciate the voice acting although frankly it's just below average. At least it's something that's often missed when people make VNs.  Gameplay involves some mini games each chapters Stealth B@stard-style. You need to travel undetected to some points mostly using WASD control. I found this to be breaking my pace on reading thru the VNs so three out of six mini games I had them skipped (there's a function to skip the mini games at the top right of the screen).  Character developments are bad. There are five major characters in this VN and only one evolves adequately. Even the main char I found him rambling too much about 'god' to the point I honestly think it's annoying. This char developments correlate directly with the storyline, which is very important for VN. I find it to be rushed also, maybe because of time constraint or whatever. Story is not what I expected it to be. Being a sci-fi, I would hope it contains more, but then the progression is abruptly halted and the game ends prematurely.  Did I say the game's performance is HORRIBLE as well? I have more than decent laptop to run any VNs, yet even on my dedicated graphic card this runs choppily. Bad optimization.  Overall the game is sub standard, but still enjoyable if you like VN genre. Had it been more expensive, I would have given this a big thumb down. Get this when it's on BIG sale or in a bundle.  5.5/10",

            "review_text": "A very interesting, although short, science fiction visual novel.  The story itself is good, although like many other reviewers have said, it does reference God and faith a lot, and it makes a poor attempt at creating emotional moments in the story. Aside from those faults I recommend it, and it is clear I am not doing the game justice by only saying what is bad about it, but I am not able to do that without spoiling some point of the story.  The minigame in between Acts is not interesting, nor innovative. And even though you were told you were given permission to travel freely in the ship you still must avoid the guards. The minigame is essentially game with floors where you must not touch the guards or walk under the security camera, and even if you are straight ahead of the guards when they are facing in your direction they do not stop you or act on it, which makes turning off the lights seemingly pointless (It says turning off the lights makes you not be seen while standing still, although if you are in the dark if a guard touches you the minigame is still reset).  The artstyle is very nice for the story, but mediocre for the minigame. The voice acting is very good (which is standard in games).",

            "review_text": "While its definitely shorter than I expected it to be, it does have a decent storyline and interesting gameplay. I've seen Visual Novels include elements of strategy games (IE: Sunrider, War Of The Human Tanks, etc.) but including gameplay dealing with stealth and sneaking past enemies? That's something I'm totally unfamiliar with.   Which is why I give this game a thumbs up.",

            "review_text": "Bermuda? Completed it mate.  Pros: Cute Nice art Plot you can almost care about 7/10 voice acting  Cons: Weird, shakey science that left a lot of unanswered questions, but not ones I really cared much for answering. Flat in every sense. It felt like something I would have written for a short story competition (and probably lost with). Short as a motherf- There's like 20 minutes of gameplay, although it is admittedly clever enough. God? Religion? What's that about? Also there was a tiny unnecessary addition of a possible fetishistic relation between two female characters which left me feeling quite.... uncomfortable.  In conclusion, recommend it to burn an ok hour of your life. The way I see it is, it's the price of a shot of tequila, and that's more disgusting than this game, so sort out your priorities.  Sidenote: Plotline has potential if it could be turned into something a bit more powerful and exciting. I like the name.",

            "review_text": "While I liked Unhack, Bermuda has nothing from what made Bermuda good, while it's similarly short, ~ 1h. Long story short: main character, friend and friend's girlfriend get abducted by 'aliens', they teleport the girl home, and the guys want to get away + know more about the strangers. The characters are basically archetypes, or if you don't want to phrase so lightly, clichés.  The friend, who can be told from first glance that he's a badboy type of a character - prison backstory, aggressive take on strangers, the usual. The girl, who's friends with the main character from childhood, ended up with the bad guy because of the protagonist get them together, and who's obviously into him. The main character who's calm, nice, and a well-mannered religious character- yes, no wonder people are always mentioning this - mentions God in every single dialogue he has. God may lead you, return to God, God can forgive then I can, God help us, God's mercy, etc. He basically doesn't have a personality, he does everything because that's the nice and good way to do it. The captain of the ship, who's nice, sees wonder in the world, and trust the guys. The bodyguard-like character, who's paranoid, aggressive yet follows captain's orders whom she idolizes + between acts you can talk to random people on the ship, who are saying stuff that's supposed to be funny and totally out of the story. They are playing games (khmUnhackkhm) on duty, there because of the tax benefits, and things like that - they take the quirky role.  Voice acting is kind of lifeless - it's understandable really well, but totally lacking any emotions or reflects to the happenings - main character tells us how the alarm triggers and they get surrounded just as calmly as he would be reading out the newspapers while having his breakfast.   The game's minigames are much less fun than they were in Unhack, and their implication are also not as deep as in Unhack was - in Bermuda, for example you sneak up to the control room - meaning you snak through 3 levels of guards in the minigame, then you're up in the control room, stuff happens. Meanwhile in Unhack the minigames were actual (un)hacking happening, you were getting information on your way, and not just padding instead of telling us ' We barely got passed the guards, but we done it'  I can't recommend Bermuda to buy. The characters lack personality, the story is meh and characters are so void it's hard to care about them. If you have the game, you can as well play it while you're idling it for hours for the cards (took me 8 hours to drop - game is 1h long...).  If you're intrested in a similarly short Visual novel, instead of Bermuda I can recommend Shen Gui which has really good atmosphere, or from Bermuda's creator : Unhack which is basically a story-driven series of a minigame, where the story being presented in a Visual Novel format.",

The whole game is voiced. Unfortunately, every time the protagonist tells you something he tries to shove God down your throat. Not in a 'I'm a religious person and this is part of the plot/character' way, more in a 'I'm a religious developer and shoving this down your throat is normal for me' way. Ruined it for me.",
