            "review_text": "In Angry Arrows, you take upon the role of Legolas who has to battle hordes of Uruk-hai to rescue Princess Zelda from the Legend of Zelda series in an alternate timeline in which she no longer wears a dress and has brown hair. Despite no longer being blonde, Zelda has gotten significantly more stupid: the alternate dimension has stripped her of her Triforce of Wisdom, leaving her with only two apparent skills: getting kidnapped and catching arrows with her face.  In this timeline, the wizard Saruman has improved the Uruks originally created by Sauron: he made them green and also very good at shooting long bows. Also, he invented suicide bomber spiders or something; he can do that, he's a wizard, you know.  Anyways, in this quest to rescue Princess Zelda twenty-five times, Legolas can rescue Zelda alone or with up to three other companions: Link, Hawkeye, or Red the Green Arrow on the same machine with local co-op. However, Legolas works alone, which is why I worked through the campaign by myself without any other person's help. And no other reason.  Besides rescuing Princess Zelda, you can also play as Garrett that guy from Thief and be in a sneaky forest in a randomly generated time trials kind of game thing, or you can also play as some guy who fights orcs in a gladitorial arena. As with the campaign mode, these other modes can also be played with others in local co-op, although Garrett and this hypothetical gladiator also work alone in their lore, which is also why I opted to not receive assistance in these modes. And for no other reason.  There is also a deathmatch PvP mode, but, as I have mastered this game, I thought it would be unsporting to decimate the competition. Therefore, I have not played deathmatch for this reason. And for no other reason.  In terms of gameplay, the most succinct way to describe this game is simply try playing Hotline Miami with a controller, but then also you have to use a bow instead of a machine gun or shotgun. Also, instead of having a 80s bee bop soundtrack like Hotline Miami, this game has a much more soothing soundtrack in campaign mode while you scream obscenities at your computer for being a ♥♥♥♥ing piece of absolute ♥♥♥♥ for not ♥♥♥♥ing reading your ♥♥♥♥ing inputs ♥♥♥♥ this game cheats so much ♥♥♥♥ everything broke ♥♥♥ game 10/10 would put disk in blender if it was on a disk.  Also, the game is less than the price of a sandwich from Subway. I mean, I don't know what else you would do with $5 if you had it, but you certainly couldn't buy a footlong from Subway. That's how cheap this game is: it costs less than a sandwich.  Also, the system requirements are a bit high, and the 13 whole MB it takes up on my hard drive is a little bit excessive. Had to uninstall GTA V and overclock my i7 in order to support this massive game.  10/10 would not recommend to people concurrently in anger management therapy.",

PROS: you can shoot mines. you can kill princesses. you can AFK and wait as the entire enemy force walks onto mines and dies.  CONS: No online multiplayer gives terrible controler support. Dont even try to use the controler  10/10 Would use an oil drum as a wall.",
