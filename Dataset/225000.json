Afterwards, the friends sit quietly together in the study of the Croft Mansion and reminisce about Lara's past exploits; exploits that have until now remained a secret..",

            "review_text": "If you're reading this, you have probably already tried at least one of the other Tomb Raider games, and are wondering, 'How will I react to Tomb Raider 5: Chronicles compared to the other Tomb Raider game(s) I have played?'. I will try to review Chronicles based on its quality relative to the other classic games in the series (i.e. the ones developed by Core).  Compared to the first four classic games, Chronicles is fairly short and (for me) probably the easiest out of the five 'Core classics'. I enjoyed the varied settings in the game's 13 levels, and I think the developers did a great job in creating a suspenseful atmosphere despite a dated graphics engine relative to that time period of PC gaming. To support this atmosphere, there are plenty of varied puzzles (although they are nowhere near as difficult as Tomb Raider 3's puzzles), good use of ambient sound effects to set the mood, an emphasis on exploration and, for a number of levels, a fun avoidance/stealth-based mechanic where the clunky combat is non-existent.  Chronicles is split into four locations and unfortunately I feel that only the first location (Rome) has that traditional tomb-raiding feel which I so dearly love. I don’t mind the occasional “modern-day” level; however I felt that Chronicles was a bit too heavy on modern-day exploration (more than half of the levels are in modern-day settings). This is a matter of taste, but one of the things I really appreciated about some of the older Tomb Raider games was getting immersed in the lore of Ancient or lost civilizations. So, while the atmosphere of Chronicles is overall still suspenseful and well-crafted, I felt that the game lacked that “epic feeling” that certain levels of previous Tomb Raider games provided (I’m looking at you, Temple Ruins of Tomb Raider 3 and St. Francis’ Folly of Tomb Raider 1).  TLDR: Chronicles is a decent “classic” Tomb Raider game, despite it being relatively short and easy, and lacking a certain epic atmosphere that all 4 previous games possessed. I would only recommend it if you have played some of the other classics (i.e. 1-4) and are just looking to add to your collection for a very cheap cost ($6.99 for approximately 10 hours of gameplay). If you’re completely new to the series and are looking to start your Tomb Raider experience, start with Tomb Raider 1, or, if you can’t tolerate the outdated graphics of the Core classics, start with Tomb Raider: Legend developed by Crystal Dynamics.  Just for reference, here’s how I would rate Tomb Raider 5: Chronicles relative to the other classic Tomb Raider games I have played, from best to worst:  Tomb Raider 1 Tomb Raider 3 (  Read my review  ) Tomb Raider: Anniversary Tomb Raider: Legend Tomb Raider 2 (  Read my review  )  Tomb Raider 5  Tomb Raider: Underworld Tomb Raider 4  (I haven’t played Angel of Darkness)",

            "review_text": "Tomb Raider V: Chronicles is definitely the worst in the Classics series. Not only is the level design uninspired, very basic and just plain boring at times, the four little episodic stories are absolutely horrendous. This game feels more like something a single hobby developer put together in a week than an actually official Tomb Raider title.  It does have its moments and some levels and designs aren't quite as bad and lackluster as others but overall it's a very dull, short and often times downright annoying and buggy experience that you can skip if you're not a completionist or fan of the series.  On a scale of 1 to 10 I give Chronicles a 3 for trying to implement at least a few unique ideas and new gameplay mechanics that haven't been seen before in a Tomb Raider game.",

            "review_text": "Tomb Raider Chronicles is a great memorial to the legendary Lara Croft after the events of the last game. We learnt she wanted some of Harry Potter's Philosophers Stone, a trip on a Russian sub, flashbacking to grim Ireland to talk to the demons with a priest who treats exorcism like a tea party and she spites old Von Croy in a wheelchair in the good ol' US and A in his own company HQ! We globetrot with our favorite female icon through stories told by old friends sitting around a fireplace after the memorial, getting steadily drunker.   It's a gentle and perhaps thankfully easier pick up and play title after the titanic epic of The Last Revelation and a breather from the relentless TR3, perfect for novices or those who want to breeze through the game without too much difficultly. That said, although the difficulty isn't too high, it boasts the hardest (and buggiest) final level to date; the perhaps ironically named Red Alert.  Highlights for me are the Italian levels with their lovely visuals and beautiful scenery injected with some good humor from series stalwards Larson and Pierre from TR1, now a bumbling comic duo that set to try and thwart our heroine but fail horribly! The Russian levels are very tense, particularly in the Deepsea Dive and Sinking Submarine levels. Ireland does well with the grim, macabre setting to instil a creepy atmosphere (Labyrinth gets props for being eerie) and as Lara is unarmed, it adds to the drama! The final stages are very hi-tech, a huge contrast to the rest of the game act as a thrilling hi-octane conclusion!  I recommend you play this after you play the first four so you get a good feel for the Core Design era before Angel of Darkness plunged it into....uh darkness. Such a shame they rushed AoD, it would have been interesting to see what future installments that could have been. But to fully live the Core Design era, start at the beginning and have yourself a TR marathon.  TRC has a special place in my heart even to this day!",
