            "review_text": "Just like when I played version 1.0, this version of the game is awesome. I had a lot of fun playing it from the new ATB system (with blocking), to how you learn new spells, to the new improved storyline. LIke I said after I played the 1.0 I am hoping for a Valcarta II to pop up sometime in the future.  Now that I finished the Light Path storyline, I just need to work on the Dark Path Storyline...which I'm sure it's going to be interesting as heck to get through.",
