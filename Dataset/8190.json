            "review_text": "Just Cause 2 is a legendary over the shoulder sandbox shooter along the lines of Grand Theft Auto without the charm. The game focuses on destruction, deep controls and doing whatever craziness you'd like to do. You play as Rico Rodriguez and you've been sent in by the government to mess things up like a kitten in tissue paper on an island nation that seems giant by gaming standards. You have the option work for different factions / gangs that have their own agendas. The gangs are a nice touch and you'll see them battle each other on the island while civilians run and hide. Its a nice AI dichotomy.  Since the game is set on a bunch of giant islands, the terrain is gorgeous and diverse. You'll see lush green jungles beneath icy mountains, then go into those icy mountains and down into sandy deserts. After that, you can take a boat for a ride across beautiful blue waters, then hijack a jet and surf on top of it into a golden sunset while dodging missiles. Everywhere in this game is a gorgeous place and there are tons of places to visit and blow up. There doesn't seem to be any interiors, but that is fitting for a game so beautiful with good traversal diversity.  The controls are deep, but they allow you to do a lot more than your average over the shoulder sandbox shooter. You have your standard, run, jump, gunfire, reload, grenade, toggle guns, toggle grenades buttons, but you also have the infamous grapple hook. This hook is what the Bionic Commando reboot was missing. Double pressing it will send you instantly zipping to wherever it latched onto. Traversal is made super easy, climbing up buildings with the hook, but not just that, but you have a parachute that is used to glide around. Simply hit the jump button while in the air to deploy the chute. Pressing and holding the grappling hook will grapple something, but then when you hold it, aim at something else and release the button, you've now tethered two things together, which results in hilarity. Tether a moving car to the ground, to watch the car flip over. Tether a NPC to a rocketing propane tank and watch them blast off. Not just that, but there is plenty of car combat. Normal games would have you just get in a car, not this game, you can get on top of the car to shoot things, or you can slip down in front or behind the car to shoot things using the car for cover as its moving. You can take over moving vehicles, with easy quick time events that show a struggle instead of just kicking a person out from behind the wheel.  Combat is pretty easy, you just aim the cursor and fire. There is no aim button, if your cursor is remotely near anyone or anything, you will see a red highlight around the logical target. So if you the player have terrible aim, Rico Rodriguez will still shoot the target. In terms of holding guns, you can hold one two handed gun and two one handed guns. There are throwable explosives and you can toggle between two types. You can also melee enemies with the grappling hook.  With so much control freedom, you can tackle missions any way that you want. Such as a car chase mission where you need to escort the driver, do you grappling hook vehicle to vehicle, taking out enemies and struggling to knock out the driver? Do you tether the other vehicles to the ground and watch them crash, or do you use your parachute to hover over the action and blow up the other vehicles? The choice is yours. It is an excellent game to do what you want.  Missions themselves give you easy to follow objectives as if they were steps to follow. Open the gate, take out that rocket launcher, take out those snipers, pick up that item, grapple onto that helicopter, and so on. The objectives are marked with red and easily found with how far away they are. If you try to deviate too far from a mission location, the game will warn you and start a 10 second counter. This keeps the intensity on and prevents people like me from exploiting things.  Outside of missions, there are plenty of things to do and they're all marked on your map. Well you need to visit the location marked on your map before you find what it is there to do. Things such as races, time trials, destroy bases and loot villages. Destroying locations and looting villages each has a percentage attached to it. To loot a village, you need to find 100% of things hidden there. Things like vehicle parts, weapon parts, cash boxes and even liberate the village from propaganda buses. Thankfully when you get near something findable, it will show up pointing out where you are, but you need to be very near it. This saves you from detailed searching. It is the same for ammo boxes and health cabinets.  As for the bases, you need to find things and blow up things such as towers, generators, gas tanks, communication towers and surface-to-air missile launchers, each will make up 100%. It is fun for explorers to seek out every nook and cranny, but I can understand if getting 100% would feel like a chore.  When you create chaos or break any sort of law, the local military will be sent after you. At first it'll be simple things hunting you down, but if you keep creating chaos, your 'heat' level will go up and more soldiers will come after you. How do you reduce your heat level? Hide. Yep hide in the jungle and after time your red heat will go to orange heat and start dropping down. This is good for keeping the focus on what you were doing before you created heat. With plenty of jungle in the game, it is pretty easy to ditch any heat you might have.  Sadly the enemies feel pretty dumb. No one takes cover when you're putting bullets into them, even if enemies are next to cover, but I guess people play for the fun of doing what they want, not the challenge. In car chases enemy vehicles will just ram other objects. It leads to some laughable moment. They'll just drive off cliffs when you hit the brakes. I can understand scripted events like running into a gas station, but otherwise it is hilariously bad.  The game is pretty easy even on normal with regenerating health. Not just that, but health pickups from cabinets seem well placed. If you die, you go to the last checkpoint. Sometimes the checkpoints are further back than you think, but that's the only thing that really presents a punishment in the game.  The real downside to the game is that it seems to crash once every few hours back to the desktop. Luckily the game has an autosave feature.  To top all of that off, there is a free Multiplayer MOD that allows every player into one world together for chaos to ensue. Is it worth $15? Sure.... but it has been on sale before at $2.50. Keep that in mind.",

            "review_text": "I never got around to play the original Just Cause. Mainly because my computer has always had issues with it, and Just Cause 2 pretty much improves the first game in all levels. Just Cause 2 is a third-person action game, and when I say action game I mean crazy jumping-from-airplanes-and-blowing-up-cities - sort of an action game. Rico, the protagonist, is like James Bond on steroids. You can pretty much do whatever you want, in a world at least twenty times (!) bigger than San Andreas, and five times bigger than World of Warcraft.   Pick your vehicle; helicopter, airplane, sports car, moped, tuk tuk etc. and pick a random location; beach, jungle, city, highway, mountain etc. to ram, stunt, blow up, crash, projectile etc. with it. Or just hook yourself to someones boat and enjoy the eyecandies of this tropical paradise. Or hook the same guy's boat into an airplane, and see him take off. Or hook the airplane to a skyscraper and see it torpedo into a ball of flames. Your choice.  The grappling hook, amongst other things, is what lift this game up from the pleasant, boring and realistic open-world games. You can use this Godly thing to pretty much survive any situation. Are you falling from insane height? No problem, just hook towards the ground and survive - Or just precipitate your parachute, that works too. It lacks actually physics though, you can't use your hook to decapitate moped drivers for example, a feature that I would want for Just Cause 3!  Sure the game is far from being realistic and serious, but with great looks, insanely huge map and more vehicles and weapons than you can count - who cares if it's unrealistic? You can stand on a plane while towing another one mid-air, for God's sake! I completely recommend this title if you are even remotely intersted in action, open-world and/or just plain time-consuming roaming and freedom. There is currently a third-party mod in the works, adding Multiplayer. It adds a whole new meaning to the already balls-chaotic world, and makes it go beyond the edge.   Pick this game up, if you have not already! It's been on a billion sales. ",

I’ve never got board of this game since I got it and I’ve been loving it ever since. Even though it is not the newest game on the market, it is still one of the best. Just Cause 2 is up there in my Top 3 favourite games ever, yeah, it means that much to me! From stealing fighter jets to driving a fire engine, you can literally do anything. One of my favourite things to do is massive road trips across the map, I know, it might be a bit sad but I find it fun! It works so well because the map is that big. I only realised that the PC map is a lot bigger that the console map a couple of months ago! At least I think it is. In conclusion, it is amazing game and I recommend to everyone to buy it because it is one of the best games I have ever played. Period.",

Improving in almost every conceivable way, it turned a game which was riddled with problems and a repetitive nature into an enjoyable experience. It's far from perfect, story falling into the stupid and cliche once more, but at least somewhat satirical this time, if it was meant to be taken seriously then the voice acting certainly didn't help. Just Cause 2 can also crash on systems well above recommended requirements albeit rare.   Besides those points, there's a lot to like. The soundtrack is better than ever and perfect for the game. Graphics are great and polished, assuming you can overlook the forced depth of field (developers please stop this.) The world is expansive yet detailed with various areas like mountain regions, cities and deserts to explore and complete. Quality of gameplay as a whole has improved drastically with better controls, intuitive combat including use of grapple, better side activates, missions and creative bosses.   Avalanche studios put real effort in between JC1 and 2 and it shows. It's a much more enjoyable game, sure it can be repetitive going for 100%, but I still got a solid 18 hours out of the game without completing it fully. So I recommend picking it up for anyone interested in an open world sandbox all about causing chaos then go for it.",

When you start going fast in pretty much any car, if you spin or drift just a little bit, you flip all over and fly a few hundred feet.

Although there are no real objectives in mp, you can figure out how to have a blast in very little time. The mod also features Race and Demolition Derby modes that you can hop into at anytime.  Race is a lot of fun, you will find yourself racing dogged old busses, or super fast performance cars, 4 wheeler atvs, even base jump racing ! Go to one of the local attractions like /tp airport ... and watch the utter chaos as a few hundred people spawn vehicles and weapons and have an all out free for all. I should note that the Multiplayer mod is still in beta, so there are occasional crashes, but nothing to get squeemish about, the game itself is really well optimized for PC, and holds up well... until you start doing crazy physics stuff like flying a boat thats spinning at 100rpm :D  ( Yep I said Flying a boat ! ) Its madness, its halarious, its goofy, and its fun.

I've also enjoyed Shenmue, Dragon Quest, Bully, Fallout, Farcry, Spiderman, Burnout, Arkham City..... any genre, any platform- it's easily my favourite type of gameworld. But the mechanics make a game and Just Cause 2 has the most fun mechanics I've ever played with. The possibilities are only limited to your imagination....... and skill. ...... Wanna steal a fighterjet? Cool, Rico can do that. Wanna fly that plane toward a bridge, jump on top and surf the jet under the bridge? Fine, Rico can do that. Wanna jump from a building flying through death defying gaps and before hitting the ground, release your parachute and walk away unharmed? Rico can do that one too. Really, once you get the hang of the controls the game comes to life in a way I've experienced in no other. ...... That would be my recommendation over if it wasn't for one final thing. Just Cause 2 Multiplayer. It's exactly what it sounds like and so much more. This is a mod that allows over 2000 players to join a single server, playing together on the same map. Nobody should allow themselves to ignore the fact that this really is a landmark in gaming. Never has a game of action orientated 3rd person shooting/jumping/driving been played on this scale.

Rico Rodriguez is a CIA agent born in 1968 task with a mission to gind and kill Tom Sheldon who stole a million dollars in Agency Cash.  The story is very linear and quite boring at times and the voice acting is just horrible, but what makes this game is its game mechanics, you have a grappling hook and a parachute and this makes you feel like a modern superman the game is no where near realistic but focuses soley on 'Fun' over realism and the balance works well, this game is especially fun with its free Mutltiplayer Mod which puts up to 2000 players on the island.  The graphics are impressive at times from the sunsets and sunrises to the beautiful nights, this game covers a lot of biomes including snow and desert and this really adds to the beautiful lighting you can see in the game.  The replay value is there but its not a game you will be playing for hundred of hours yet this said and done there is enough content here to last you over one hundred hours, but it just gets kinda repetitive.  When it comes to the share of fun this game is the definition of fun, I really reccomend you pick this up and check it out.  _________________________________________  Overall: B+  _________________________________________  If this review helped you please let yetteh know :3",

The only thing which is annoying about the game is that crashes every now and then (though I have experienced it twice only). No matter how good a PC you have, it WILL stop responding at some time and crash. That is, for me, the only con of this game.   Overall, I would definitely recommend you to get it.

            "review_text": "This should have been the gamers' game of the year.   will start off from the very thing that got me hooked to this game. It's the map. This game has the second biggest game map ever created to date (I was told that FUEL has the biggest map which is 5,560 square miles)  Just cause 2 map is 37 by 37 kilometers. A couple of kilometers on each side of the square map is water, so let's go by 35 by 35 kilometers. Multiply 35 by 35 and there you go - you have 1,225 square kilometers of map to explore, give or take 100 square kilometers.  For the comparison, let's take the Fallout 3 map. That map is about 35 square kilometers. The Oblivion 4 map is roughly the same size. GTA 3 is 35-36 square kilometers GTA 4 is 15 square kilometers And I thought the Far Cry 2 map was huge. It's 50 square kilometers. The ARMA 2 map was definitely the biggest one before Just Cause 2 stepped in. The most important reason why i bought the disappointingly unoptimized ARMA 2 is to simply explore the roughly 400 square kilometers map.  I remember wondering when I was younger if they would ever make a big enough map for a game which I could explore for days and days and days. I thought they finally did that with Arma 2, and despite the fact that I still could not play the game on maximum settings even when my rig should have easily taken on almost 2 ARMA 2's (According to the 'recommended settings'), I still loved the fact that I could enjoy the country-side that I haven't been to in years.  The second thing is that we ACTUALLY have directx 10 in this game. FINALLY, how many more directx 9 games are we going to have? We have directx 11 already, so what's the deal? The directx 10 pretty much seals the deal and completes the game map that I still cannot believe they made. I also cannot believe that the entire game fits on a DVD, how the HELL do they pull that off? shouldn't the map this size be at least 30 GB? I mean Age of Conan: Hyborian Adventure is like a 30-35 GB game.  Well, the third thing is... Ah what the hell, you know the rest. Complete freedom of action, unrealistic stunts, the temporary to permanent abandonment of the laws of physics, infinite parachute, a hundred of drivable vehicles, a cute Easter egg, the Hatch from the first and second seasons of LOST, the pleasure of having to spend 20 minutes just to fly from one end of the map to another on a stolen government jet, the joy of swimming in the sea (wish they had sharks though), the eye candy explosions that you never get tired off, the realistic driving of the vehicles (aside from the way they rotate in mid air sometimes), the realistic damage to the PARTS OF THE VEHICLES THAT WERE ACTUALLY DAMAGED IN THE IMPACT, I could go on and on about this game  Im also playing this game on IMPOSSIBLE and find it quite easy to beat. You just move constantly, shoot (There is sadly a default auto-aim option enabled that you cannot disable) and press 'tab' or whatever you have to evade bullets. HOWEVER, a nearby grenade explosion is almost guaranteed to kill you, so for MAXIMUM realism, I recommend playing this game on IMPOSSIBLE  Im not gonna complain about the check point system, I love the checkpoint system. it makes games more challenging. Plus there still is a SAVE option, although it doesnt work in its original meaning  The story is blah. Who cares? Some of the missions that they give you though are somewhat original and a breath of fresh air from some of the repetitive GTA missions. However, most of those missions are, attack, kill, destroy, blow up, move on. It would have been nice if they added an element of stealth to the game though. It would feel great if could actually play as a somewhat silent or stealthy lethal saboteur. I would also like it if they imposed a penalty for killing civilians both on purpose and incidentally.  I know this game won't win the game of the year award since there is no real substance I guess, but unofficially, this will probably be the gamer's choice No 1 game of 2010. (I hope Metro 2033 wins the game of the year though, which I rationally know it won't)  This game is a pinnacle of guilty pleasure if I can say that. It absorbs so much of my time that I barely have enough time for myself, and its only my second-third day of playing the game. For the third day in the row I come to work late with blood-shot eyes. I actually prefer to staying home and playing this game all weekend and after that, instead of going out with my gf. That's how much impact this game had on me.  If you are an extremely busy person with a busy schedule, i do not recommend playing this game until you find some time to kill, otherwise you'd get the plants vs zombies syndrome, where you cannot stop playing the game and start missing out on life. But I guess, now it's gonna be the Just cause 2 syndrome  I don't want to get emo about this but I'll say honestly that it's actually games like these that make me sorta happy that I was born with enough luck and resources to actually play them, but I'm only speaking for myself here.  Until then, the most rational case for you is to buy this game, support the developers and enjoy it fully until your eyes bleed and your brain melts, since forgetting about reality as much as possible should be the just cause of all gamers.",

While the story is laughable, it really sets the stage for what this game is all about: grappling hooks and parachutes. I've been an advocate for strong storylines and atmosphere in games for years now, but this game alone has really reminded me of what it feels like to play a game purely for fun. To further sweeten the pot, this game has aged really well.  Pros: -MASSIVE open world that lets you do everything from deepsea dive to skydive. No place is off limits right from the start. -A wealth of vehicles, allowing you numerous options for transportation. -Diverse environments including deserts, jungles, cities, oceans, and snowy mountain ranges. -Various weapons, including miniguns with infinite ammo for over-the-top rambo vs. helicopter scenes. -The best grappling hook I've ever used in a game.  -Playable on lower-end machines. I am experiencing zero lag on my Asus with GeForce GTX 560M with 8gb ram.   Cons: -Poor optimization. Expect bugs and the possibility of a little extra work to get this game running smoothly.  (This was especially true with my Nvidia graphics card) -Forgettable story. While some of the characters are interesting, there wont be much to hold your attention here.  -Initially confusing mechanics. It may take a little while to get acclimated to moving around with the hook and chute.  Overall, this is a suprisingly fun experience that will easily consume countless hours of your time if you let it. For me, it's a wonderful way to decompress after a full day of work.   10 grappling hooks out of 10",

While there is a slight learning curve on the controls, halfway through the game youll be able to do things with precision unrivaled by many games.  Some complaints:   I've found little use for land vehicles considering how many are available. What I mean by this is that once you figure out the tricks of the parachute, you'll realize that with some skill, you can achieve a very respectable speed without the limitation of terrain. Also some of the locations not attached to a mission feel copied and pasted, but are still fun to navigate, and possibly the cost of having such a large sandbox to play with your toys in.

The grappeling hook has been attached to Rico's arm so you can shoot your gun and grappel onto people and surfaces (at the same time.) You can now do something called 'dual hooking.' Dual Hooking is where you take your grappeling hook and tether one thing to another, so I can take a Titus ZJ (a sports car) and tether that to a Pandak 'Baby' Panay statue (statue of Panau's current dictator) and drive off in the Titus ZJ and the statue that I tetherd would fall down.

AMAZING GAME  However (for my opinion) the campaign feels short after I finish it, not enough missions and storyline at the missions. It feels like the main storyline devided between the factions there but they know how to do the missions - how to design and make them.  Just Cause 2's multiplayer is just amazing!! Some servers allow you to speed up to the maximum speed of your vechile, in some servers there are also activities/events such as: the last one standing, racing, Real-Life and even more, there is server of Real-Life.

Panau is so detailed and so large, that it is one of my favorite game worlds ever. It might even hold first place. There are all types of biomes, from desert to forest to mountain snows to vast oceans etc. The gameplay is priceless. I might be driving a car around, observing the driving laws of Panau city, then be blowing up stuff with a max heat level in 30 seconds!

My current PC runs it maxed at around 90-100 fps, but my old craptop took this game to 25-30 on minimum, it'd been at 45 if I changed some ini settings  Final score: A deserving 9, for the game lacks a good storyline, and has annoying black market cutscenes, and pointless hijacking quicktimes.",

            "review_text": "Just Cause 2 is honestly a fantastic game. You are put in the shoes of agent Rico Rodriguez as he is sent to the South East Asian archipelago of Panau to hunt down his old mentor and do whatever it takes to remove dictator Pandak Panay. A Just Cause indeed. If the other reviews on this page are any indication then it is obvious this game is good enough to define its genre. In fact, if you still haven't got it there is literally no better time than now. Since Just Cause 3 has come out recently, you may question why get this game instead? Although Just Cause 3 is a natural progression from Just Cause 2 and has better visuals and gameplay, this game is still brilliant in it's own right.  Gameplay: This game's gameplay is innovative, exciting and somehow doesn't get old. It can only really be described as a mashup of Michael Bay, James Bond and a monster truck rally. The goal of the game is to destroy chaos objects and cause chaos in Panau, and the game gives you the tools to do this. The game's patented grapple hook is Rico's signature weapon and can be used to 'creatively' kill the countless grunts of the Panauan military as well as tearing down various governmental assets. Rico also has access to a variety of weapons which can all be acquired via the Black Market and can be upgraded to cause even more mayhem. There are well over 300 settlements in Panau to 'liberate' of Panay's military assets and each is filled to the brim with weapon parts and vehicle parts to upgrade your black market items. Despite there being so much to do, the tools given to Rico, including over 100 seperate vehicles, don't make this momentous task boring. And even after all that, there are still races which can be completed in various vehicles and skydives which can be of varying difficulty. Despite this gameplay can eventually get repetitive (you find that after 150 hours and getting 99.4% completion) because the things you blow up don't come back, unlike petrol stations in Just Cause 3. Speaking of which there is a glitch in the game which prevents you from getting 100%, so don't waste your time trying to get that without a relevant mod. The AI in this game can be variable, sometimes being very good and sometimes involving an enemy pilot flying into the side of the Berawan Besar mountains. Overall the gameplay in this game is 9 out of 10  Open World The world of Panau is vast, with 400 square kilometers to explore, Panau is vibrant. The world is varied as well with mountains, jungles, deserts and the sweeping metropolis of Panau City. Honestly the open world in itself is enough to sell this game providing Rico plenty of room to cause mayhem. The world also features many distinct landmarks such as Panau Falls Casino, Three Kings Hotel, Panau International Airport and the infamous Mile High Club. This ultimately creates the best open world in the Just Cause series and possibly one of the best in gaming ever. The game even provides fast travel to make travelling around the vast world that bit more convenient. The destructiblity of this world is pretty astounding when you consider the amount of possible versions of Panau there could be. The only cons are that some civilian settlements and military bases can seem a bit copy-pasteish at times and large amounts of Panau actually is covered in jungle which you can't really do much in, these things I've found aren't actually an issue in Just Cause 3. Overall another 9 out of 10  Performance Just Cause 2 should have no issue running on any modern gaming computer, or even just a normal computer. It is well optimised with few frame drops (on a worthy computer) and the graphics are highly customisable to allow performance tweaks. Yes, lag is possible, particularly on more casual computers but load times are normally quick, unlike its successor. Overall an 8 out of 10  Graphics While not meeting the standard of Just Cause 3, the graphics in this game are superb, with vast draw distances and pretty graphics. Generally blurred textures aren't super common (mostly found on rockfaces) and the water looks fantastic. This game lends itself to fantastic views across Panau and I don't have much to criticise about the game's graphics. The only con I can think of is that the trees in Panau can look a bit papery, perhaps because the tree leaves are actually 2D sprites that change direction to face you (Just Cause 3 has this same issue) Overall a 7.5 out of 10  OST and sounds While the OST in this game is nothing special, as there is actually a distinct lack of music in Just Cause 2, the sounds are actually pretty solid. Explosions are satisfying and gun shots echo through the jungles with reverberation. Music is mostly heard during races and when Rico has heat, but although fits the mood very well, isn't anything memorable Overall a 3 out of 10 for music, but that increases to 6 when sounds are considered  Story Your typical Just Cause story. Dictator rules island nation with iron fist and has plans of world domination. 'Department of Infrastructure Improvement' Rico Rodriguez comes along, causes chaos, dictator shoots nuke but plan backfires. The story isn't bad, but it isn't good either. Just Cause 3 does have a better story, but again if you're looking for story, avoid this genre altogether. Characters are mostly forgettable with only Tom Sheldon really being super memorable, but the story and faction missions are good. This game knows how to not take itself seriously, so in reality the story doesn't really matter, just don't be disappointed. Cutscenes do have action, but they sometimes have a habit (particularly on slower computers) of having the sound and video go out of sync, leading to painful cutscenes that just don't work. Overall story gets a 5 out of 10.  Multiplayer This game itself has no multiplayer aspects, but there is an offical multiplayer mod which is free after buying the game, which is honestly fantastic, and I wish they'd make a multiplayer mod for JC3. Personally I recommend the NerdCubed Fan Server as it is the most popular server found on JC2MM. Speaking of other mods, this game has a great modding community which leads to an even more chaotic game.  Overall this game is fantastic, and I consider it a must buy for anyone who enjoys a bit of chaos, particularly as it is only £10. Yo uwon't be disappointed. Overall this game is 8.5 out of 10.",

The things you try to do in that game realeases your creativity like crazy! I remember filming over 3 hours of myself jumping Sharkcats all over islands in the map. Also jumping or getting some vechicle and grappling it to the 474 Airliner planes and going until I slowly weighted it to the ground.   But, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ police in this damn game will ♥♥♥♥ you off to the point where you don't play anymore. Their extremly accurate, shooting your plane that is 100+ feet in the air, also raming their vehicle into you accuratly to where you fall off, then take your sweet ♥♥♥ time to get up. Thats another thing is the gracefulness that your damn character puts on is horrible, 'let me roll on the ground to SHOW you my pain, then ill get up'. Jesus. You do get some great laughter off of this game and thats why It proves to be epically fun in my opinion. Lets see how long I play Just Cause 3...  100/100",

            "review_text": "Just Cause 2 is an impressive sandbox game with a gigantic map. It's pretty cool! I'll give it a review.  GAMEPLAY: Just Cause 2's gameplay like a stereotypical action movie - turned up to eleven. It's got an open-world GTA-like format with cars, planes, guns, and boats. The map is HUGE. It makes Grand Theft Auto's playing field look tiny. If traversing a map this big sounds difficult, dno't worry - you play as a dude called Rico, who is basically the latino spiderman. As Rico, you can use your grappling hook as much as you like to grab onto anything and launch yourself in that direction. A really cool feature is that you can latch your grappling hook onto a car to hijack it extremely quickly. You can also do crazy stunts and deploy parachutes whenever you like. That's right - Rico basically farts parachutes. There's lots of guns, explosions, and all kinds of crazy things. You can do missions, but to unlock missions you must cause lots of chaos first - which is good because blowing up things while in police pursuit is EXTREMELY fun.  PRESENTATION: The game is absolutely gorgeous. The island of Panau looks amazing and relaxing. The explosions are huge and dramatic. The gunplay looks cool and cinematic. There's not much I can really say about the graphics except that they look great in all aspects. Perhaps not the most realistic, but the game is a few years old, so it's to be expected. Music is nice but there's not much variety so it may get a bit repetetive.  STORY: Not the game's strongest suit. The story is rather lacking compared to something like Fallout or Half-Life. Sure, it's there, but it's not pulitzer-prize caliber stuff. The story never gets in the way of the gameplay because it's really not that important.  I'd have to say that Just Cause 2 is definitely worth buying. It's fun and allows for hours of non-stop gameplay. If you like Grand Theft auto or similar open-world games, you should definitely try this one. Just cause 2 isn't perfect, but it is one big fun, explosion-packed adventure with tons of things to destroy and bad guys to defeat. Can't wait until Just Cause 3 comes out!",

However, it does offer some of the most fun destruction-based gameplay I have ever experienced. You play as Rico, who has some the most ridiculous dialogue in the history of gaming. A few things to be aware of are that, for one, this game has the ♥♥♥♥♥iest cutscenes of all time. Maybe it's just my computer, but wow, not only does the audio occur four hours before the characters move their mouths, but people move ultra-slow. Like I said, this may be a computer issue on my part. In the end, Just Cause 2 is a fun addition to the series, and has completely amazing graphics, especially for a game made in 2010. EDIT: I have a new graphics card now (AMD Radeon 7770 Low Profile) and everything runs beautifully. Absolutely fantastic cutscene graphics.",

That is: they ignore the plot and just zip around blowing stuff up? Well: Just Cause 2 is a game that you're SUPPOSED to play like that. Sure, there's a plot (and it's as stupid as it is zany, all the way from pulling statues over with tractors through to the climactic fistfight on the back of a cruise missle), but who cares: you'll spend your time using a hookshot to pull soldiers out of aircraft, steal the aircraft, fly the aircraft into a radio tour while you jump away with your parachute, all the while shooting, hacking, and slashing anybody that gets in your way.  It's completely silly, the voice acting is almost as appalling as the scriptwriting, and the plot makes no sense. But that doesn't mean it isn't one of the most-awesome games ever. Play an hour or play 5 minutes: this game's great for 'dropping into' when you need a few minutes of quick destruction as much as it's great when you want to execute a thought-out mission. And nowadays, it's cheap, too - no excuse not to give it a go.",

It also has a story you can follow, with segways into random mayhem as you build up enough rep to progress. Its a free for all rampage to get the rep, pretty fun. Huge island game world too.  My only realy gripe is that when flying, it goes into a high up 3rd person view, which is very difficult to control a fast plane through ravines, under bridges, and trees to do some races. The trick I found was to always hold down the right mouse button and pull the camera down level with the plane... while flying those races, as it prevents camera-auto-snap to that bad angle. After I figured that out, I was able to complete 100% races. Actually I have 100% completion of the entire game and achieves. Yes. this game is that fun I actually wanted to do 100%!  So, grab this game on sale. You will love it if you like open world action flicks with driving, boating, flying, sky diving, and crazy action.",

The story is stupid. LOTS of racist accents: 'Get-a out-a of the way-a!' ^No joke^  That is the wrong way to play this game. It's crazy, it's stupid, it's ridiculous. There are tons of vehicles to drive/pilot and/or explode, a HUGE world filled with pedestrians, most of which have nice cars ripe for the taking, and the grappling hook. Oh, the grappling hook. If you play this game the way it's advertised, the grappling hook will completely break the game. If you play it the crazy sandbox way, the grappling hook becomes the most fun you can have. Shoot a grappling hook to the top of a building, then snipe some cars until they explode. Keep doing so until the MILITARY takes notice, and starts sending helicopters. Shoot a grappling hook at the helicopters, shoot the pilot in the face because QTEs are for boring people, then use the grappling hook to attach a statue to the bottom of the helicopter. Fly higher, and when the statue's head pops off, use it as a Miley Cyrus to destroy the other helicopters. Then pull a parachute LITERALLY out of your butt, and float gracefully down onto the bridge, where you steal a car by grappling onto it and pulling the driver out. Drive to the other half of the city, pull another parachute out right before the car smashes into a propaganda trailer and explodes, and repeat the process, with as much variation as you like across dozens of cities, villages, and military bases.  This game gets a Rico Rodriguez/10 It's stupid and highly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, but if you look at it the right way, it's extremely fun, not to mention extremely hazardous to anything within a 10-mile radius.",

In Just Cause 2, you are a secret agent for the united states named Rico and you're dropped into a southeast aisian country called panau with the goal to cause chaos in any way possible. The story is very short, but there are a lot of side missions that make up for it. The game is very glitchy but that adds to the experiance even more becasuse it can lead to some very hillarious moments. Like durring a boss fight thats supposed to be serious, you just lose it at people throwing themselves off of buildings unintentionally. I HIGHLY recomend this game to anyone who wants a game to play whenever they are bored. Its better with a controller.",

The island is big enough to explore, you can be able to destroy everything thats around you. The storyline of the game is bad, with a silly voice acting and weird looking character movements. The graphics are very colorful and the water effects and everything is amazing. The gameplay is also GOLD, running around with a grappling hook, getting to helicopters and parachuting everywhere. The DLC's are not bad to buy, got them already in the sales and they make the game very fun! And also the multiplayer which is only for PC, its pretty fun with your friends.

Best of all there's no waiting to get your hands on awesome hardware like helicopters or rocket launchers (plenty of enemies and places with them). Highly recommend if you want a cheap (in price, not quality) game to entertain you for many hours.  Probably the most overpowered weapon/ability is your grappling hook, which you start with and always have. Enemy on a mounted turret? Just grapple him and pull him off. Attack helicopter on your butt? Grapple it and punch the pilot out and take it over. No vehicle to get around? Just grapple onto a tree, mountain side, tall building, etc. and from there grapple onto another tree/cliff side/building/etc. If you get high enough (via grappling) you can jump and open a parachute (which is always available) while falling and grapple the ground (or other object) to move yourself in that direction. Then there's attaching two objects (including enemies) together, such as attaching a soldier to a passing car, or a helicopter to a military truck/tank... physics will do the rest for you. Its main limitation is its range, but its not painfully short.   Also there's a Multiplayer Mod that as of this writing is in early but playable stages and I believe is free. Ex: you can attach a tank to a helicopter and have a friend fly while you're in the tank shooting the cannon. It is also loads of fun and should only continue to get better with updates.",

            "review_text": "This is one of my favorite games of all time. The sole reason I made a steam account was to attempt to play the demo on my pc. I first jumped into the demo on my playstation 3, and was instantly hooked. I went back and replayed the demo dozens of times. In that small, tiny, free slice of the game I got at least 15 hours of gameplay. The actual full game has dozens of times more content than the demo, and all of it is just as fun, if not more fun, than the demo.  At first look, it just looks like any other action shooter, but this is so much more. The brilliant idea of including a grappling hook that can pull you to any location was pure gold. Whoever thought of that should get a very large cut of the profit. Combining the grappling hook, parachute, vehicles, combat, explosives and tons of other things is simply said, some of the most fun I've ever had playing video games.  Vehicles and driving are fairly solid, but I would prefer better controller support on the pc since there are sensitivity issues while driving cars, but everything else is fine. Especially helicopters. There are few things as fun as flying around high above danger, shooting miniguns and rockets at enemies below while simultaneously hijacking chopper after chopper as enemy pilots attempt to take you down.  Not only is the gameplay solid, but the graphics look amazing (on pc at least). Panau island is a beautiful place, and I sometimes just decide to jump into a jet and fly across the massive, beautifully detailed island. And that's another thing, did I mention the size of the game? Panau Island has over 400 square miles of glorious sandboxy goodness for you to do whatever the heck you want. Whether that be taking over enemy bases and strongholds, blowing up everthing in sight, finding creative ways to kill enemies, just admiring the scenery, playing evil knievel in all the possible vehicles, or all of the above, Just Cause 2 is possibly the most fun you can have while gaming.",

This game looks great, feels just slightly odd, and has just the right amount of everything in regards to weapons, rides and countryside. Great balanced gameplay that's always changing, massive open world to explore from deserts to tundra wastelands. Three warring factions and a little fat man whose statue is always so fun to pull down with a car, or even more so drag his head around behind a helicopter for a bit. I mean there's no bigger middle finger than that to the man.  Rico's one-liners are terrible, but wow, are they ever great.  This is one of those games, between the explosions, the crazy crashes, the ragdoll effects, being able to pull your chute just moments before hitting the ground, only to survive the most body-wrecking crashes of all time, only to get up and say something like 'Mama Mia, something something.' You can't help but laugh and totally get your money's worth out of this one.  This game is fantastic. Oh, and even now with the MP mod, which is really nothing more than a big public crash, kill and laugh fest, how can you not pick this game up now, even if it's not on sale?

DLC's I recommend to get are the Black Market Boom Pack for the air propulsion gun (this gun will give you the most fun you will ever have in any game) and the Black Market Aerial Pack for the Dual Parachute Thrusters because that is just neat to have.

Just Cause 2 is a third person shooter, open world sandbox where you are basically a god that can do whatever you like. Litteraly, anything. I have to say that I am a huge fan of this game. I've put 30 hours into it on the Xbox 360 and 20 hours into it on PC. This is a game that is so off the wall that it just works. The fact that the devs could mke such an outlandish game with such solid gameplay mechanics is baffeling. It does have glitches here and there but there is no game of this scale that doesn't have a few bugs. The good thing is that the glitches don't happen that often so it's not that big of a deal. The only downside to this game is it's story. It's very repetetive. All of the stronghold capture missions are copy pasted into different locations. However something funny happens every time you do a mission so it's worth it. The missions also get you weapons and vehicles so that's another plus. However this game is all about free roaming which it does very very very very very very very very very well. It's a little like GTA but way more outlandish and crazy. I can not recommend this game enough. If you don't own this game do yourself a favor and get it now. You won't regret it. Also, Just Cause 3 is coming out so look forward to that. ;)",

I am still so happy with that purchase. Just Cause 2 has beautiful scenery, and even with a midgrade rig, you can enjoy the vivid colors and graphics all the same. The wide open world is what really blew me away. The ability to drive every vehicle you can imagine across this vast landscape can make a man feel powerful. Although the cities and town locations become slightly repetitive and nearly identical, it is still very much fun to reek havoc for the Panau people. The mechanics of the game are simplistic enough, and allow the player to take full reign of Scorpio the mercenary-- cheesy catch-phrases and all. The story missions themselves are clearly not the shining star of this game, but who says they have to be? The story does what it needs to do, and still allows just as much chaos as the sandbox destruction.   This has always been, and will remain as, one of my favorite rainy-day games. 8/10",

However there are a few things that are quite annoying and need tweaking -   1. Vehicle handling is NOT this games strongest point. It is quite hard to learn so if you are looking for a game which has good vehicle handling GTA 5 for example then this game is NOT for you.  2. Cutscenes - Probably the most annoying thing about this game, they are so out of sync. Sometimes the background noise will just cut out, they lag and character voices are badly out of sync with the subtitles. (I think this is just on PC because when I played this on PS3 I had no problem with cutscenes.  3. Apparently if you liberate military airports then planes stop taking off (I'm not sure if this is the case as I am not very far into the game and I haven't done much)  But this game is not all bad. Here are just some of the many good things about this game -   1. Reasonably good graphics.  2. Wide variety of vehicles to choose from.  3. I love how you can just go around liberating different cities, villages, ports and military bases.  4. The game world is enormous.  5. It is like GTA in a way.  6. It is like an 80's thriller but in a game.  Overall I rate this game 8/10.",

By pressing 4 and then E when there is a signal you can get equipment, vehicles or an extracton once you get those options and you can upgrade them. You can do virtually anything but be careful when flying planes because that is real tough and one of the hardest things to do on the PC for this game. 9.5/10",

But if you admire freedom in an Open World, it's hard not to be seduced by this game. It just gives you so much of it: so much places to explore, so many vehicles to drive, so many weapons to upgrade... you kinda feel without knowing what to do, so many great options this game gives. With an involving satire-like plot (America will blown sh.it up for your freedom!), and a lovable as.shole as the player's avatar (it was a great idea to reprise the protagonist: he might very well become the next great videogame character), 'Just Cause 2' may very well be one of the best Open Worlds today. My tip: you might want to save the game before heading to the 'Into the Den' mission, since the ending of this game is by far the best thing Square Enix did in its history, and you might want to play it again, just for the awesomeness (literally) of it. It's just so crazy you have to look by yourself.",

Races are fun, and cover every vehicle(fly, drive, sail, basejump/parachute). The DLC are friggin' awesome.  Cons: Lacks mission variety. Outside of missions and races, all you can do is blow stuff up, and that does get old. The typical 'big dumb action flick' plot and characters are completely predictable, forgettable uninspired. No real consequences, dying(outside of a mission) doesn't 'cost' anything, you don't even lose progress.  I recommend this to any fan of GTA and/or open-world games in general.",

I was driven mainly by the faction missions, fun little side missions with variety, and from just plain exploration.   The game looks absolutely fantastic, and runs smoothly at full settings in my modest machine. The world is colorful and inviting, with great variety in biomes and locations.  Enemies are very stale, with little variety and tactics that are limited to shoot, lob granades and then shoot some more. The shooting is also very conventional and nothing to get excited about. Where the gameplay really shines though, is in the incredible movement freedom your grappling hook gives you. My god if every open-world had that hook I'd be completely broke. If you combine it with one of the grappling strength enhancement mods and/or a multiple grapple mod you become a techno-spiderman that can link SUVs to helicopters and make enemies vanish by attaching them to motorcycles.

The game throws normal physics, any remotely serious storyline, and common sense of all kinds out the window in favour of pure, uninhibited fun. You are almost never limited by such annoyances present in other games as dying, getting from point A to point B, invisible walls, cutscenes, or morality. You're handed 400 square miles of awesome on a plate, given a toybox of recklessness and let off the leash.  You play as Rico Rodriguez, a secret agent/demigod equipped with a grappling hook, a bottomless bag of parachutes and the ability to turn any gun he picks up into a WMD. As Rico, you can grapple people to cars, grapple cars to people, parachute onto military bases while shooting everyone, steal helicopters in mid-air and then go on a rampage, and cause many, many explosions. Like, wow. I'm pretty sure it rains gasoline in Panau. Just shooting at cars for a few seconds causes a satisfying Hollywood fireball to blossom forth, and most military bases are practically layered with fuel containers and interestingly volatile SAM sites and communications equipment. Even moving around is fun, grappling the ground with your parachute out to propel yourself forward at sportscar-like speeds.  You can steal jets, take down armies single-handed, run rickshaw bike thingies off cliffs, and go on an entertaining variety of explosion-packed missions. This game offers you an incredible degree of freedom that other games just don't have. Not to mention there's a community-made multiplayer mod, where you can embark on epic explosive adventures with your friends, use boost plugins to propel your car to lightspeed, and have derbies with fire engines on top of airborne strip clubs.  I can't reccomend this game enough. It's just beautiful to play. I mean, how can you go wrong with a game about a demigod secret agent with a grappling hook using dictator statue heads as wrecking balls?",

With the resent release of the multiplayer mod as well now you can join you friends and hundred of others, flying and planes helicopters, driving in a massive selection of anthing from cars to tanks to (with the purchase of dlc) hovercrafts! I cannot recomend this game enough. The only thing to consider when buying this game is that it is relatively old, but this barely show due to the fact this game was so before its time. The crowning jewel on the game though is the grappling hook and parachute which allow you to not only to glide through the air but grapple and steal every vehicle, even grappling two vehicles together. So what you can do in this game is rarely limited buy the game itself, as you can really do anything you can imagine. ",

The game takes place in a generic 3rd-world Asian police state, run by a generic dictatorship. The plot is rife with clichéd characters, painfully bad voice acting, and 'why the hell am I doing this' moments. That being said, no one's playing this game for the plot. The plot in an adult video is just an excuse to get people porking, and the plot in Just Cause 2 is just an excuse for Rico to blow things up.  The island of Panau is completely open, and you can go wherever and do whatever (outside of instanced or timed missions.) There is a strong incentive to explore, as you can find upgrades hidden inside fishing huts, on top of skyscrapers, and just about anywhere you can think of.  Exploring is amazingly fun, as the island of Panau is huge and has dozens of unique environments: scorched deserts, rainforests, tropical shorelines, snowy mountaintops, and a sprawling metropolis. Any vehicle you see is yours for the taking, although there are obvious repercussions for stealing military vehicles.  PROS:  + You get money for blowing things up + Exploring is extremely fun + SO MANY different vehicles: cars, trucks, jeeps, hummers, tour buses, motorcycles, scooters, rickshaws, motor boats, jet boats, tugboats, prop planes, small jet planes, large jet planes, armored trucks, helicopters, fighter jets... not to mention Rico's signature hang glider + Graphics were amazing by 2010 standards, and still pretty decent for 2014 standards + The grappling hook is stupidly fun to screw around with + Absolutely HUGE, beautifully designed map + Enemy military is still challenging, even with lots of weapons  CONS: - Story resembles something written by a middle-schooler - Plane controls are ABYSMAL (wasd) - Can be difficult to find specific weapons/ammo (honestly, just Google where the rocket launcher spawns and you'll be good)  OVERALL: B+ Good if you want to just blow things up with impunity, or if you need a sandbox-shooter to hold you over until GTA V comes out on PC.

There are a few downsides that arent too drastic. Sometimes travelling may seem to take forever and the landscape can get a little repetitive. As you play though, you will realise that its just a matter of finding the right transport. Also, a key aspect of the game is 'Chaos' which is generated when you destroy government marked utilities, complete missions and destroy millitary establishments. So instead of just going from mission A to mission B, you have something to keep you busy while you travel.  A must buy for anyone liking the GTA genre.",

There's a ton of cars, boats, planes and helicopters to fly, a lot of places to fly or drive them to, and stuff to blow up once you get there. If you enjoy playing free roaming 3rd person shooters, you will probably enjoy this game. It also helps that the graphics are nice to look at.   There's a slight problem with 'popup' of some details, but it's not too distracting.

The controls are excellent and being equipped with a parachute and a grappling hook you just literally fly from location to location. And speaking of the locations there are a ton of them and they all look gorgeous! People tell me they have fun just roaming around in GTA which I never found that fun. Now roaming around in the 1000 square kilometer map of Just Cause 2… THAT is what I consider to be fun. There’s nothing serious or realistic about the game. It’s like James Bond and A-Team on crack. It is so relaxing to just leave your brain to the office and come home to blow a couple of industrial sites to pieces by first crashing a jumbo jet to them and then finishing the job with a helicopter.

The game offers wonderful graphics, but also will run on any reasonably modern system. Amazing action, a main mechanic is blowing things up. What nore does the action lover in one need?  The dual set of parachute and grappel wire works well, offering versatility and mobility, even without a jet, car, or boat. Its a key mechanic, and it works flawlessly. The parachute can take some getting used to, but once you have it, which you will get the hang of after just a few minutes, you'll be soaring across the island. With those two in hand, the island becomes your playground.  This game is an action movie you can play, bail out, and watch the explosion and carnage, Mow down enemies with dual sub-machine guns, take a quite approach with a sniper rifle, or just steal the enemie's helicopter with chain guns and use that. Getting chased? Use your grappel hook to swing the enemies into the road. Many options for constant action and sheer awesomness. Tired of that? The one shortcoming of this game; the story is more of the same with a few characters.  The map is massive, with Mountains, a city, a jungle, a desert, a lake/ocean, plenty of variety. And with each area, the main character's apperance changes, he gets wet after swimming, dusty in the desert, snow covered in the mountains, and looks normal while in the city. In each area, there are towns, military bases, wilderness, roads, and such to explore, even after you complete the storyline, you will have no shortage of areas to play in.

If the heats to much just run down the road and call for a tank then come back and blow the area away. The options are nearlly endless just up to your way of playing. You can even climb vertical using the grampling hook or pull a guard out of a tower, you can even swim underwater to evade guards or high jack a patrol boat, helicopter, jet while flying. Very large play field will keep you amused for months. funny comments from rpg's in game. Is easy to use controls with mouse. Was really surprised at quality of graphics for a low priced game.  ",

The gameplay isn't the greatest. At times it can be frustrating due what I consider poor controls. Yet even with that said that is an extremely minor fault to a game of this size and scale. It goes on sale frequently and I would extremely recommend picking it up. Its a great way to kill some time.

And then we have the DLCs -- there are some very interesting vehicles and guns, including a monster truck, hovercraft, and air cannon. And last but not least, the multiplayer mod. The multiplayer mod has to be one of the funniest and most entertaining mods I have ever seen in a video game. Overall, while JC 2 does lack some features that contemporaries such as GTA IV and V have such as entering buildings, this game is simply a blast (Pun intended).

These are combined with a pretty barebones story to make it very repetitive, especially since the missions, being so numerous, gradually start to look very similar to each other.

Blehh...  - Nothing interesting about the missions. Fly to a military base, blow it up, find a way out, repeat.  - Sometimes the dialogue feels like it was written by a 12 year old with strict parents.   Still an overall great game, though.

The opportunity for puns is obvious. Why would you steal a passenger jet and fly it directly up the bum hole of a sunbathing prozzer? Just cause! Praise and large quantities of gamer ♥♥♥♥♥ will swiftly follow. However, this pun is so obvious that every game reviewer and their cat and their cat's squeaky toy will have used it, so you may have to post-modernly draw attention to that fact at the start of your review so everyone assumes you're using the joke ironically. Remember, the ironic gamer ♥♥♥♥♥ is just as soft and lovely as the regular kind.  Just Cause 2 is a game for ♥♥♥♥ing around. You unlock story missions by doing the side missions, and you unlock side missions by blowing ♥♥♥♥ up. So the ♥♥♥♥ing around is what holds everything together, like the chocolate around a Twix. You have absolutely no objective outside of the main missions and the game can be modified to buggery. My personal favorite set of mods is the Superman mods, making you fly about like the man of steel, only to realise that if you catch a rocket your face is most likely going to be painting a road or house down below. The system for clearing the game is to complete a number of objectives, be it collect stuff such as drug drops, human skulls or even just crates of cash. This can add a lot of diversity to every time you play the game.  Just Cause 2 is a fantastic game, if by that logic you love being absorbed into a sponge covered in the gelatinous slime of your ex girlfriend's ♥♥♥♥♥.",

Its just more fun than the newest gta, it is insane.. I need to purchase it again for this steam account because i miss playing it. One minute doing a nice cruise in a car the next your at an airfield all in jets taking off flying and getting lost the next your offroading, then you end up at the most craziest airport ever which is just people drifting about flying about whether plane boat helicopter or parachute blowing the absolute crap out of each other or your at a race track where people are drifting while being chased by helicopters and what. Just Cause has the right title it makes no sense its just because you can ;) (silly word play).  I'm hyped for just cause 3 i hope we get more of this and so far what they're showing us we will no idea about multiplayer for it but that would probably be the first thing the modders would be doing i guess :D..  Note: To play multiplayer you do need the multiplayer mod. its free, its amazing, just do it..",

Agent Rico coming here woth a simple mission: make a little revolution with blood, explosions and chaos. 3 groups, as well as some other agents will help you with this madness. You are waiting for the freedom of action, crazy tricks, a huge game world, the evil, but stupid soldiers and helpless citizens who only remains to be witnesses of the chaos around, and just complain about their life. There are many missions, some of them really fun (for example, Ular's mission on the mysterious $-island with old japanese World War 2 soldiers), but most of them repetitive, taking military bases, hijacking of transport, pressing the buttons, assasinating VIP.   I got a lot of fun in this game, and I recommend playing it. And don't forget to play online multiplayer with your friends.   Final verdict: 6.8/10",

The game is repetitive as a whole (go to cities, villages, military bases and basically make it yours but where the fun lies is in exploration and the crazy firefights. I personnaly like to go offroading with one of the jeep or the marten storm (looks like a hummer) and just drive and go as far as I can. The scenary is just breathtaking. How many times did I end up alone in the middle of the desert at sunset or on the edge of a cliff and just go wow! You go from snowy mountain tops to tropical settings.  Some people seems to have some crash problems, I had only one so far in over 20hrs of playing, rest of the time, the game is running fine on my vista 64 bit machine, eyefinity without any problem so far.

Just Cause 2 is like playing a B-grade action movie: It couldn't care less about realism and just goes all-out on the explosions and badassery.  The game throws normal physics, any remotely serious storyline, and common sense of all kinds out the window in favour of pure, uninhibited fun. You are almost never limited by such annoyances present in other games as dying, getting from point A to point B, invisible walls, cutscenes, or morality. You're handed 400 square miles of awesome on a plate, given a toybox of recklessness and let off the leash.  You play as Rico Rodriguez, a secret agent/demigod equipped with a grappling hook, a bottomless bag of parachutes and the ability to turn any gun he picks up into a WMD. As Rico, you can grapple people to cars, grapple cars to people, parachute onto military bases while shooting everyone, steal helicopters in mid-air and then go on a rampage, and cause many, many explosions. Like, wow. I'm pretty sure it rains gasoline in Panau. Just shooting at cars for a few seconds causes a satisfying Hollywood fireball to blossom forth, and most military bases are practically layered with fuel containers and interestingly volatile SAM sites and communications equipment. Even moving around is fun, grappling the ground with your parachute out to propel yourself forward at sportscar-like speeds.  You can steal jets, take down armies single-handed, run rickshaw bike thingies off cliffs, and go on an entertaining variety of explosion-packed missions. This game offers you an incredible degree of freedom that other games just don't have. Not to mention there's a community-made multiplayer mod, where you can embark on epic explosive adventures with your friends, use boost plugins to propel your car to lightspeed, and have derbies with fire engines on top of airborne strip clubs.  I can't reccomend this game enough. It's just beautiful to play. I mean, how can you go wrong with a game about a demigod secret agent with a grappling hook using dictator statue heads as wrecking balls?",

It has a lot of things to do but it is very repetetive. You have to make your own fun with things. :) My biggest gipe with this game are some of the game mechanics. The game is quite fond of spawning enemies close to you around corners and behind certain objects in order to surround you. Not a huge deal but after a time it becomes noticible. Some of the land vehicles handle like a banana peel on greasy black ice and are used in a few racing challenges. Speaking of challenges, most of the base jumping challenges are a bloody nightmare because the circles you have to get through TURN to FACE YOU! This migth not seem like a big issue but I can't tell you how many times I've been dead on a circle only to miss it because it tilted instead of staying static.  Soime positive things: There are several weapons in the game. All feel good and there is little overlap. The game has you switch weapons faily often because what ever you are currently using the game will not spawn very often. Like if you're using the assault rifle then very few enemies will spawn with it. They will spawn with shotguns or machine guns instead untill you pick one of those up. You can also drive vehicles with mounted weapons. The Razorback being my favourite with an autoloaded battlecannon and twin machine guns. A few types of helicopters and figther jets are availible. Sadly, the military will not send other jets to hunt you down if you steal one. :(  I had much fun but also raged a lot in the game.

You do this by blowing up government stuff or side missions but if you choose destroying stuff the chaos required for the main missions is so little that its faster doing repetative faction missions -driving land vehicles is a pain in the pc since it feels sluggish and akward. You're better off using a controller -the vehicles can go into insane speeds that it gets harder to control your vehicle -using land vehicles is pointless if you use a grappling hook then quickly use the parachute then when you're flying just keep using the grappling hook and you'll keep flying till you run out of land, making land vehicles pointless -story is a meh. You won't really give a crap about the chracters and the story -distances to your missions can be really long that you'll hate traveling   I can't really decide a final score for the game but do I recommend it? Well despite the many cons I've described it depends on you but for me its a yes since its really fun and testosterome filling.",

            "review_text": "A very notice open-world third person shooter with a bunch of story and a lot of explosions. The typical Just Cause formula.  There's simply nothing bad you can say about this game, it's fun, challenging enough to not get boring easily, it becomes a sandbox after the main story ends and there's a crapton of collectables.  Gameplay: The game starts out relatively fast paced, the tutorial is fluently designed to work with the game, but features like using the grapling hook to pull down enemies from high points, i.e. watchtowers, or connecting them to the ingame world, i.e. surroundings or vehicles, are simply sandbox gimmicks: Fun to use every now and then, but essentially you'll forget about them in the heat of combat.  Graphics: I can't say too much about this part, as my computer forces me to play on low-ish settings, even then the graphics are simply stunning, with little details such as Rico's clothes 'looking' wet after coming out of water. Especially explosions look amazing.  AI: Could be better, but it's pretty advanced. Whenever available, any AI combatants will use any stationary turrets in their surroundings. A great example of this is the gangs fighting military forces (the military wins most of the time), after which the military forces generally use the gang-vehicle's stationary turret. Although their aim on moving targets could certainly improve.  Controls: Of course, controls are customizeable but are easily learned nonetheless, the game supports controller input as well. I do really dislike the default map button assignment, which is F1 for some reason, playing on a laptop would force me to hit Fn and F1 all the time, but I simply changed it to M, which makes more sense imo. Vehicles each control differently but are generally very steerable, I suggest using a controller for driving cars. Helicopters are the easiest to steer in my oppinion, while (jet-)planes are hardest.  Misc.: After the main story, the so called 'Mercenary-Mode' is being activated, in which you can freely roam the island and clear settlements to reach 100% progression, which is a nice challenge. What you have to do in each settlement is the same all the time: collect any special parts lying around and destroy all government equipment, such as fuel tanks, water towers or generators. Even though it sounds repetitive, it somehow doesn't get boring at all.  Overall this game is worth the money you spend on it, the multiplayer mod (which is available for free in the steam store) has improved a lot in recent times (such as synchronity and all that).",

The explosions were bigger, the voice acting was more tolerable, the weapons were crazier, and so on. I could list many more things that JC3 does better than JC2.  But you know what? Despite ALL of that, Just Cause 2 has a certain charm to it that 3 doesn't. JC2 is honestly just...I dunno. It's so much more fun to play. Maybe it's because it feels less generic and AAA-ish. Maybe it's because you didn't have to do little challenges and destroy the same boring props in every town to progress. Maybe it's because the world was more varied and interesting, and towns and bases felt like actual places instead of bullet points on a list of things to blow up. Just Cause 2, as unpolished as it is, ends up being the more enjoyable game in my opinion. And this is just vanilla; JC2 is stupidly easy to mod, and there's tons of crazy mods out there to really crank up the insanity. Naturally, it's also far easier to run than JC3. Even the craptop I keep in my room can handle this game at 30fps on low settings.  The current price of $15 is well worth it imo. If that still too much for you, you're in luck because this game goes on sale frequently and it's dirt cheap at that point. You could be standing in line at Target and pick up 3 Snickers bars and Just Cause 2 on sale would be cheaper. And the Snickers would be gone after a minute or two.

The final con is something that seems to have been an issue with Just Cause 2 running on newer systems. A lot of people, including myself, are experience crashing.

It seems this games age is starting to show in it's compatibility with newer systems, and I would suggest not buying it unless you are aware of this, as it could happen. For me at least, nothing has fixed it, so at this point we would have to wait and see if the developers fix the issue.

The world is so huge, but THERE IS NOTHING TO DO. NOTHING. What? Are you just gonna fling your stupid grapple hook around and just swing to places? Also, the explosions are nice. Except that they are small and there is only like 3 things to blow up. Once you blow something up, it does not respawn so you can't go back and blow it up again. The inventory system is disgusting. It is so bad. I have a loadout equipped and when I grapple to another place, the loadout is gone and I have to reequip it again. This whole game revolves around that stupid hook.  AI is so terrible. I am literally shooting rockets and throwing grenades and the civilians just walk around like it is nothing. When I get close to them (and I don't have a weapon equipped) they start running away in fear. Also, everyone looks the same. It is just a bunch of asian dudes wearing that stupid straw hat and a bunch of military dudes just shooting all the civilians for no reason. During combat, enemies take cover but if I throw a grenade or walk past them, they do not move.

I kinda imagined it like being a Saints Row focussed on grappling hooks, aerial stunts and a jungle surrounding. Oh boy, was I mistaken. The first thing coming to my mind: Jep, console-port. Technically there isn't an issue with console ports, I know quite a few that belong to my list of favourite games. But if 'HEY I'M A CONSOLE PORT' jumps into your face just by looking at the game's menu and said menu's handling, that's one minus. When navigating said menu feels tedious and not geared towards utilizing a mouse at all, that's another.  And then the game starts, dropping you right in without anything remotely resembling a story. If I say that the first Duke Nukem had a better intro story, then that's not an overstatement. Well, we're here for the action, smooth combat and stylish grapple hook slinging, not the story, right? I was literally baffled once I got my hands on the first few guns, started using the grapple hook and fought a couple of enemies. But not in a positive sense. I mean, the game is built around the grappling hook, right? Then why does it look like glitching, crappy animation made in a hurry whenever the character grapples upon something? Why does jumping look like it was importerd straight from CounterStrike (No, neither Source, nor 1.6, I'm referring to the original first release)? At this point, all the other minor-medium negative points, like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ enemies, malfunctioning physic, extremly plain and unintuitive gunplay or the fact that the left mouse button fires the right firearm and vice versa, barely playmuch into the rating of this game being terrible.  Admittedly, it might have some great moments or content later on, but that's of no concern to me when the first hour of play already makes me want to puke at whoever deemed the animation engine of the game acceptable for modern play.  Result: 3/10, because hey, at least it doesn't look extremely bad and it got grappling hooks.",

The lack of ammo drops (like the ones in Mercenaries {Pandemic Studio 2005}) resulted in a rebuying of expensive weapon drops at $50,000 a piece instead of $2,000-$3,000 for ammo drops... and it unfortunately affects the gameplay in its unefficiency. Plus... the car/truck driving was stiff and not as fun as the driving in Sleeping Dogs- also from Square Enix.  The world map is huge with plenty of places to go, and its scenery is incredibly diverse with snowy regions and tropical 'Far Cry 3' locales... but the gameplay rarely changes. I don't know if I would pay any more money for Just Cause 3... maybe if it played like Sleeping Dogs I might buy it, but very unlikely. It is BORING.",

It's crashes even if your computer meets the recommended settings, and that voice actors and cheesy lines.   The only way that you can enjoy this game, make it your dirty pleasure, there's no other way.  2/10 - If you have a lot of money that you can throw around you can buy this game.
