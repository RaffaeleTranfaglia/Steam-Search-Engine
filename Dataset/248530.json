Instead of just swimming around, there is treasure to find, or take pictures, and catching fish is fun too. The world feels very alive, the way the fish move seems very well done. Taking pictures is very rewarding there is an excellent feature of being able to make them your desktop as well. There are multiple places to visit for diving that have many attractions under water from ships, to planes, all kinds of things that make exploring fun.   I rate this 9/10. But to be realistic, the game's price is about 8,99$/eur ",

            "review_text": "Depth Hunter 2 was a surprising game that I was not expecting to enjoy. I'll admit it looked really boring and in a sense it was as there is not much variety in the actual gameplay - you catch fish, hunt treasures, take photographs, solve a couple of very basic puzzles and explore the ocean floor and that's it.  However, saying that, it was SO relaxing! The scenery was beautiful, the background music was lovely and it was just a nice way to chill out for an hour or so after lots of shooting people in the head in other games!  I got it in a bundle so only paid pennies for it and I wouldn't pay full price for it, but I'd recommend it to anyone who can pick it up cheaply and wants a nice relaxing break from all the hectic games out there.",

The game is very short, you can beat the game in 2.5 hours, but considering it is an indie game and there aren't many others like it I would recommend picking it up if you find it on sale.  Swimming and exploring and watching all the fish swimming is nice and soothing. There needs to be more games where you can explore under the ocean.",

The controls are just right to make spearing fish challenging but not too frustrating. Underwater world is done pretty well, it's a hard thing to master but I think they did a good job. There are a plethora of missions ranging from treasure hunting to fish spearing.  This is a really casual game. Don't expect a high level of action.

Basically you swim around and cowboy your way through the Areas, the only thing that can stop you are some red warning Lables that tell you not to kill Turtles, Manta Rays, Crabs and some other Species.  You can also collect Gold Coins and Treasures, for my taste there are 'a little' too many of them.  You can earn Gold with hunting, completing challenges or taking Pictures of the Lifeforms and use it to buy upgrades for your Camera, Harpoon or your Oxygen supply so you dont have to swim to the Surface every few Minutes.  You cant die, when you run out of Oxygen, you will just be 'teleportet' to the Water Surface.    Some Positive and Negative things short:    + The Game has easy Controls and is easy to understand. + As mentioned, you can upgrade Weapon, Oxygen Supply and Camera. + The Water looks good + You can hunt some of the Species + Only a small downloadsize of ~500Megabytes  - No Multiplayer - Sealife animation looks weird, almost like on rails. - Annoying and Facebookgame like Music and Sounds. - Overall the Engine and Textures, beside the Water itself, look really dated and ugly. - Rather small gaming Areas - The Mouse movement and acceleration... oh well...   Not sure what to say as closing word. Lets say its fun for a little while, but you will forget about it really fast. Also if you really, really want it, i would wait for a ~75% sale! its not worth the current price of 14,99â‚¬.",

You get various missions to complete while you can also just swim around and take photos or kill â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.

However can't really say the full price is that expensive either so up to the gamer if it's worth the money or not!  Graphic wise.. Not sure. It looks damn good but it still has some mayor graphic issuses since most fishies looks derpy up close.  UPDATE AFTER COMPLETED THE GAME: Best feature must be the 'set to background' button in your fish gallery. Amazing to see the cute turtle everytime I start my computer. :^3",

I guess it is easier to make a beautiful game when it is underwater. The problem however comes from the gameplay. The only challenge comes from trying to stay awake while playing. This shouldn't be a game on steam, it should just be something that you do on your ipad/iphone while you wait at the doctor's office. There really is no gameplay to speak of. You swim around endlessly underwater while harpooning countless fish with a hand held harpoon gun (lol) while finding treasure items on the seafloor. It's like one of those point-and-click treasure finder games where you have to click around screen and find all the items, but instead of still images you actually get to do something, albeit not much. I was blown away by how beautiful everything looks. I've never seen underwater graphics in a game look better. It might have even been better had they not included the horrible treasure finding part. It isn't good when you are alt+tabbing out to the game's store page on steam to see if the game has any real objectives or other things to actually do that are fun. It also might be the smoothest running game ever. It's too bad there is really nothing fun to do, just swim around and fight off the sandman.  Mr. Sandman, bring me a treat. Engaging gameplay with fun objectives can't be beat. Both of which this game has none of.",

I came in expecting pretty scenery (while not expecting the best graphics, the set peices looked pretty well designed) and probably something photo-taking, doing some nice undersea photography.  Instead I became a fish-slaughtering Rambo-esque diver murdering everything I could which came my way with speed and precision never before seen by my hapless prey.  And I found it a bit weird that undersea treasure and gold coins were worth less than a single fish. It lead me to the conclusion this must be set in the future where fish hunting is banned, and I am an illegal fish-poacher.  So, highly recommended if you happen to like undersea exploration, fish murder, or both.",
