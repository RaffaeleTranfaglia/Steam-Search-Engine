    "description": "There is an unusual cabin deep in the woods. It had served as a laboratory and a dwelling for three generations of Lodgers.But as of late the latest Lodger has been noticing weird changes in familiar surroundings; things are missing, noises and rattle heard. Something odd is coming out of the woods.",

            "review_text": "This entire game takes place in one night(watch the clock when you have the lantern) in spasms of sleep walking and brief bad dreams. I loved it, but it made me angry, and I am sure it'll make you angry, too.  My girlfriend and I played this together, off and on for three days, trying to get the 'good ending.' Two things: One, it deliberately obfuscates its own systems. As in, learning the rules and dying in the process is part of the game. Two, it is about general tension and anxiety-- the atmosphere of absolute ick, not shock scares but pervasive questions about what you accept as real. It is a strangely gross-feeling game that manages to put you in a completely agitated state. Not terrified, not disgusted, not creeped out. Just agitated. To the extreme. You know, like an insomniac. Which is the point of the game. That skin-crawly, nothing-is-quite-right feeling. A world out of place.  -IF- that kind of tension and weirdness appeals, and you think it might be a cool experience to live through/conquer/think about, this is an excellent game. But I also get the feeling it'll ♥♥♥♥ a lot of people off. Whether you'd like it or not, worth experiencing.",

But that point isn't fascinating, as the means to achieve it.  The story tells us about the Lodger - a withdrawn person, recluse, who lives in the forest. There is only the forest, surrounding the house, but it isn't so creepy as the residence of the protagonist. Strange things happen here: things get lost, heard extraneous steps, someone knocking at the door...  Gameplay is limited in inclusion of lightbulbs in rooms, playing with somedoby invisible 'Hide-and-seek' from an unknown entity, and solving the riddles. As for indie-horror it's amazing. Scary sounds sometimes are forced to stop and think what to do next, which cannot be unenjoyable. The clock ticks, floor squeaks, you hear strange quite voice - all this creates its own atmosphere.   In total, this game isn't so bad, as many people think. I really enjoy it, when I played. My first and last advice for this game is to listen to the advice of the developers: all you need for playing is solitude and dark, qiute place.",

            "review_text": "I've had this dream before. Sort of like a dark version of Bill Murray's 'Groundhog Day', where I run and run to try to get away from *something* that's chasing me, and I finally make it to the front door, open it, and... I'm back in my room trying to get out again. That's this game, only I'm sort of like a punked-out Chucky doll in a nightgown and my house is way tidier than it is in real life.  To be fair, I haven't beaten it yet, but I intend to when I can give it my full attention. This game *deserves* my full attention. The sound effects are nice n' creepy, the locations and characters are beautifully drawn, and I'm really digging the plot. The Lodger is appropriately self-aware, and there's something about the twisted Simlish that he speaks in that reminds me of the narration at the beginning of Lars VonTrier's 'Riget'. I like the mechanic of going into the rooms and waiting for the furniture to fade into view -- it may be repetitive, but that just adds to the dreamlike atmosphere.   This is not an action game. This is not full of adrenaline-boosting jump-scares. This is for when you have insomnia, and need something to make you feel like falling asleep ever again would be a bad idea. It's also great if you want to turn the volume up way loud and make your roommate say, 'What the **** is THAT?' And then they take a look at the game and fear for your mental health. It's beautiful, and dark, and eerie, and dreamlike, and wonderful.",

            "review_text": "So I got one major issue with this game: When you get to the point the giant demon appears and the white line is gone before you finishe the game, you'll be in game over forever in that playthrough and have to start over from the beginning. Prefer if it went back to the start of the demon showing up...  Beyond that, it's a good game to play in the dark (best experience too). There seems to be some sort of mystery of what's happening to the guy, but  I haven't beaten the game yet to find out  it doesn't explain much of it... there's some story going on but it's purely up to speculation.  The concept of Hide and Seek is interesting though in this game. There are certain rules to follow and you are often given forshadowing signs of what to do. Once you understand the rules, it'll be a breeze.  Controls are simple and basic. I had issues with video quaility at first, but after messing with settings I got it to work properly. (If I couldn't get it fixed on my end I would've requested a refeund as the quality I was getting was bothering me and ruining the immersion).  Eventually the gameplay does get tedious with nothing new to add or offer after awhile. The difficulty shifts constantly though: may get lucky in one level but be stuck in another for several attempts.  I have no other issues with this game. I would get this on sale though, but up to you on that.  -----  Check out more games I see that deserve more attention from my curator group:  BluePaw's Underrated Games List  Join and/or follow if you wish.",

But i still love it. I love how creepy it is. I love how there are random voices that say the creepiest of things. I love how they so far haven't used cheap jump scares. In fact the entire game just gives off this creepy vibe, I may be stuck on this one part and keep repeatedly dying, but i love it, and I am already addicted even though i haven't played even an hour yet. I don't think i will be able to sleep today. TOTALLY WORTH THE MONEY. It's tricky and it doesn't straight out tell you what to do. But thats what makes it fun.

            "review_text": "The game's weird and obtuse, and that'd be perfectly fine if it didn't have a game over. If you do something wrong, the game will penalize you the same way every other game does, by forcing you restart a section.  What you do in it is avoid ghosts as you go from room to room fixing lights hoping something useful will appear. You win the level after a few minutes elapse. Getting caught by a ghost or hiding from them will force you to wait longer. You may also find a clock that makes time go faster, so you'll have to wait less. The word wait is essential to this game and that may give you a clue of how much fun it is.  The rules are unclear, which is fine, even welcomed, but in the first thirty minutes or so you'll understand them.   The real problem, however, is that enemies may spawn on top of you as you're climbing down a ladder. They may appear with no warning from a door as you're busy opening it. It seems they're programmed to spawn randomly, with no regards to the player's current position. More than once an enemy appeared blocking the only exit, and I had no choice but to be caught. There is some (very little) strategy involved in winning, but it's offset by randomness.  If you're unlucky, you'll have to redo the level. That'd be okay if the core gameplay wasn't repetitive and mechanic. All you do is go from room to room, hold X for a few seconds to fix the light. Then, you may or may not get the choice to wait a few seconds to see if an object appears.  That's it. Most of what you do to progress involves waiting or holding a button for a few seconds. You may also choose to take risks and go to an area where a ghost may be in, but at a certain point you'll have nothing else to do but to venture into these areas and hope a ghost doesn't spawn on your face.  You may also force ghosts to disappear, or objects to appear, by leaving and entering a floor/room repeatedly. Which isn't engaging at all and just feels like you're abusing the game. You can also choose to do everything really slowly and remain in safe areas for as long as you want to wait for the time to pass.  Often you'll see unusual things that you don't fully comprehend, and if you try to interact with them you'll be forced to restart a level. For an instance, you'll see an eye on the wall, the game will tell you how to interact with it. If you do, you'll be taken to a place where all you do is walk, then you'll have to restart the level.  Then there's another section to the game where all you do is fix all the lights and walk in a forest, there's no risk involved in any of it, no challenge either. Once again, that'd be fine. I like walking simulators, I like weird games. But the section just keeps repeating itself.",

Now there are quite a few 2nd side-scrollers that are 'horror' and 'psychological thrillers' and they all suffer from the same problem: cheap jump scares and simple tales based around sanity or the lack thereof. A pyschological thriller needs more than a forgetful character who can't tell the difference between dreams and reality to make it good, and there has to be more than jump scares (monsters appearing out of nowhere) to make it a horror. If you're young or you haven't been exposed to many movies or books that are really in the horror and pyschological thriller genre, you'll probably like this. If you're an old gamer like me who has been out of the house and read a few scary books, you'll be disappointed with this.
