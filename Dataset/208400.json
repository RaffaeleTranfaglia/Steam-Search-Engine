There is probably more storyline in this small download than in the entire Skyrim. There are many long hours of play ahead. I did a restart about 2/3 of the way through as my party was not strong enough and I had not distributed t6he party stats well, combined I have nearly spent as many hours now on this game as I did with DragonAge inquisition. Despite the old school graphics there is quite variety of terrain to explore.  The character development is good and straddles the boundary between too simple or too complex well. I suggest you pay attention to creating a balanced party, which is also an area that I feel could be improved. It is too easy to create parties that will simply not work. Having a bow user sounds great, but the game is heavily weighted to swords. Another area which could be improved is the character conversation scripts. Old storylines do not disappear and too often you get into a dialogue that you have already been through a million times before with the NPC â€“ it is almost as if the same people that wrote the NPC scripting for Divinity Original Sin did this one too.

            "review_text": "Okay so I'm pretty much hoping that my point gets across through my increasingly copious amounts of game time, considering I've had it for all of a week. If not, here's the gist of it.   Spiderweb Software is an amazing company, and I originally discovered them through their Geneforge games. Now, I was skeptical when I first began playing Avernum because in my opinion it had a lot to live up to. I think I can now safely say that this is my favorite of all their games thus far. It is a remake of Avernum 1, which came out over a decade ago, and all it did was improve. Currently there is a gap in the story, because Avernum 3 has not yet been remade (though I assume you could go play the original) and so unless you're fine with skipping right over to 4, you'll just have to wait with bated breath.  I know a few people who tend to ignore their games due to the admittedly strange graphics (how long can that man hold his arms like that, christ). While their portraiture and icons are very nicely done, they do skimp a bit in the 3D area, though I presume not for lack of trying. Having played a bit TOO many RPGs in days past I believe it to be somewhat nostalgic.  In short, the story is amazing, the art 'antique', and the replayability significant. If only we could port our endings to the next games. 9/10.",

            "review_text": "First of all I must say I am a big fan of role play games, that I started back at the date with Eye of Beholder: I consider the top of the genre Baldur's Gate (the first one), and this is the first time I play an Avernum game; I was therefore completely new to the lore, mechanics and rules used in the game. From the beginning Avernum: Escape from the pit looks intriguing and catchy: from text to text and fight to fight, I found myself playing for 3-4 hours straight after installation without realizing it. The art and the drawing are inspiring, there is a lot of text that really make us feel the story and the lore, dialogs are brilliant; character creation and advancement, fightings, divine and arcane spellcasting: everything it is intuitive and somehow innovative, taking clear inspiration from old paper rpgs and fusing it with 'modern' skill trees. Longevity also seems to be a strong point of this title: I played 4 hours and visited 3 cities, and I could understand from the world map how insignificant is the portion of underworld I explored so far. The only negative feedback some people might point out is graphics, and on this I completely disagree: it is a simple retro 2d graphic but is not bad at all: on the contrary it is clear and fluent, does not disturb the eye and does not require big machines to run. Also the music is fitting, with its epic tones: it is just a pity that there is not a bigger variety of tunes. All in all, I would recommend this game to all rpg fans and to all retro gamers, giving it a solid 8.5 out of 10. There are not many better roleplaying experiences than this one out there :)",

The gameplay is fun, especially if you like tactical, turn-based battles. Be sure to save often, however, as it is very easy to wander into fights that you can't win yet. That's part of its charm, in my opinion, as you can feel powerful one minute and then have to reload the next! Better yet, I've had plenty of battles that required quite a bit of time as I was evenly matched.",

You should absolutely buy it and support a great indie developer.  The only thing I would comment on is the writing. A lot of people have gushed over the writing saying it's wonderful. Well, it  is  good, but have the right expectations: the writing is less the next Lord of the Rings in video game form and more having the best DM you could possibly imagine creating adventures for you.  Definitely should get this game!  EDIT: So I wanted to just add a final thought to my review. after putting almost 30 hours into the game, I've pretty much abandoned it. After thinking about it, I've realized the game lacks player agency. This means that there are no real choices in the game - there are dozens of quests to partake in, but there is no consequence if you don't do them. They are also almost all linear. The greatest choice present in most of them is whether you  actually  give a discovered quest item to the patron the commissioned the quest. Again, if you don't, the only consequence is not receiving the quest reward (which may or may not be better than the legendary item you're handing over).   Games can overcome this if they have an immersive narrative or compelling aethetics and atmosphere. Unfortunately, this game lacks both. The narrative is ok and the world is unique, but it isn't enough to keep me going after 2 dozen hours.   Now, some of Spiderweb's other offerings do give the player more agency. So again, I recommend the game, it's fun, but I just thought some may want to know.",

            "review_text": "One of my favorite RPGs!  Avernum: Escape from the Pit is actually a remake of the original Avernum, which is in turn a remake of the older Exile: Escape from the Pit. This remake uses a modified version of the engine from Avadon: The Black Fortress, and not only has better compatibility with newer computers, but also is improved in the way of graphics and usability.   I'm not going to talk much about the graphics. Since this is a SpiderWeb Software game, there isn't going to be much in the way of spectacular graphical effects. Everything is in 2D, but the art has a charm to it that lends itself to the genre.   The lore and story of Avernum is what makes the game great. The game takes place in an unnamed fantasy world ruled by 'The Empire', led by the ruthless Emperor Hathorn. Hathorn crushes any resistance by banishing unlucky souls into an expansive unground cavern system known only as Avernum. Crimes as petty as vocalized discontent is enough to earn a one way trip to Avernum. The enterance is a one way portal underground, and there is no way out (?).   You take control of a band of 4 adventurers, each guilty of unspecified crimes against the crown. Upon arrival in Avernum, you learn that despite the harsh conditions of the realm, Avernum has developed its own society, with its own towns, culture, and government. All is not well, however, as the underground Kingdom is locked in a constant state of warfare with the other races that inhabit the caves. The lizardlike Slitherazki, the catlike Nepharim, and the rebels and bandits who disassociate themselves with King Micah's state all try to break down the fragile thread that holds Avernum together.  Once allowed to roam Avernum, your adventurers might find themselves without direction. The world is open, with few prohibitive roadblocks to stop any exploration of the caves you might find yourself wanting to do. The dangers of the southern and western caves will keep you away until you've gained more experience living in the caves. There are three ways to 'win' the game, each of which will reveal itself to you as you gain fame with the people of the cities.  1) Banish the demon lord Grah-Hoth 2) Exterminate the Emperor Hathorn 3) FInd a way to escape the tunnels  These are all lofty goals, and completing smaller tasks to gain strength is a must.

Or maybe I'll become the new king, I honestly don't know. Right now, I'm content with delivering wine to the miners of Fort Draco. This is definitely one of Spiderweb Software's best.

You don't need graphics to tell a good story, but you need a good story that sinks it's hooks in right from the start, and Avernum is one of those. I'm really looking forward to Avernum 2.  Probably the only real downside with Avernum is how god-like your characters get toward the end.

They haven't lost their creativity and knack for story-telling in all these years, and I'm glad to see them come to Steam at last. I do miss those books you could find on bookshelves and read in Exile. One of them was rather raunchy, and involved a buxom maiden running from a deranged, sex-crazed mutant squirrel.

However, it doesn't make character development confusing or strange; you know exactly what you are doing to your characters.

It has a sizeable world that's depressive, but still full of flavor. The game's not easy, it requires patience and cunning to get through its dungeons, castles and ruins. There are even hidden bosses that you might not want to trigger until you've grown a bit stronger. And there's often more than one way to approach a problem, or enter an area. In short, the game demands patience and tactical thinking, and offers a great experience in return.",

To draw people in to play the games back then the games had to be either utterly fun or have a great story. Games like Ultima IV were like that, utterly horrible looking but so deep you could play through it ten times and still not find eveything the game had to offer.  'Avernum: Escape from the Pit' [AEftP] is just like that... Except that the graphics are actually fairly good.   This is a HUGE roleplaying game with so much ground to cover that you at first don't know what to do or where to go. As you start the game you're free to explore everything and everywhere, even places that will get you killed instantly. The game relies heavily descriptions and dialogue, so if you're afraid of reading this game might not be for you. However, if you DO like to read you'll find a game with great storytelling, a good combat system, and more content than you can burn through in a month.",

While I admit that games like this are almost exclusively niche appeal, Avernum has a deep enthralling world that was the first of the RPG genre to really bring me in. There's lore everywhere, and in a game where the top down setting would get in the way of that, it actually shines here. The world feels real despite not being first or third person, couple that with cool battles, spells, enemies, skills, and of course, sweet loot, makes Avernum quite a good series.   If you've never liked RPGs or games of this top down turn based genre before, however, this will not change your mind.",

            "review_text": "One for fans of classic indie RPGs. Don't just look at the graphics and think it's cheap and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ - the developer Jeff Vogel has been building this world for years, creating a detailed fantasy setting and deep plot. You have a lot of freedom in character choice and progression, though this potentially lets you cripple your party by ignoring balance and picking all sorcerers. (Don't pick all sorcerers. That's hardmode.)  My favourite part of this game is not being told how tough an enemy encounter is going to be. You might wipe the floor with those giant lizards using a single Call the Storm spell. Or you might get dazed, ensnared, and burned to a crisp by exploding slimes. The fun part is picking up from your most recent autosave, assessing where you went wrong, trying something different, and coming out on top with another strategy. (Tip: trigger fights and then retreat to a bottleneck, if possible. Don't underestimate upgraded spells, either.)  The clumsiest part of the game is the interface, which harks back to more than a decade ago, and has some annoying quirks. Can't alt-tab on Mac? Pathfinding range is limited and automatically enters dungeons if they're in the way? Isometric layout makes it difficult to click enemies in the square above you? Some of this stuff seems so obvious that it makes me think Jeff's decided it would take too much time to chip off all the rough edges, but you have to admire his dedication to making games *for a living* which means *to a budget*.  (Edit: it doesn't look like I have many hours in this game, but that's because I mostly play offline on my laptop while commuting. I estimate I've spent at least twenty on it at this point - and dozens more in Jeff's earlier 'Exile' series during the mid 90s.)",
