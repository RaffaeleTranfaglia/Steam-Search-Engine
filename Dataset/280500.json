            "review_text": " General:  Do you like challenges? Then KRUNCH is for you. I would put it in the same box with the VVVVVV and Super Meat Boy because at some point it takes a lot of patience to get through the levels. This is by no mean a casual game so expect some cursing and sweating along the way.  While there are no checkpoints, levels are pretty short so you can easily play the game in 5 minutes break, which is great. Controls may seem a bit clunky at the start but you get used to them quite fast. Game offers 4 themes, each specializing in different kind of traps, mind breaking yet cool traps. Each one of them ends with a huge challenge - 'run run run and don't hit the corner' type of a level.   Replay value:  For competing type of a person there is a highscore you can climb up to or you can earn some extra Achievements if you want extra challenges. Yes, there are reasons to play this game over and over again.   Bugs/Crashes encountered:  None   Overall: 4-5   (on a scale from 1-5)     Graphic: 5  (Really nice pixel art with great effects)     Music &amp; Sound effects: 5  (Music works just great)     Gameplay: 4  (Gameplay is really fun but sometimes you'll just get deadlocked with all the bumping)     Other: 4  (Unclean interface - how to toggle fullscreen? How to return to the main menu from the game?)     Conclusion: Yes, you should BUY this game if you like challenges.",

            "review_text": "Let me start with saying that this game is moderately good, but it has some insanely annoying bugs and way too high price for an indie game (asking $10 for this is actually hilarious).  Now, let's get into specifics.  First and foremost, controls are bugged. You can't move+accelerate, until the level hasn't loaded yet (you'll just end up stuck at the start, if you'll hold the buttons). Also, the controls aren't really responsive -- there's this 'lag', when you press the buttons, but don't move just yet, for a few milliseconds. This might not seem big, but since this whole game is about right timing, this is actually crucial (especially if you're trying to set a record).  Second of all, achievements are bugged to a point of no return. I'm an achiever -- I love to farm achievements, and I was pretty disappointed when even the easiest achievement weren't unlocking, even after 3-4 repeats. This annoys me a lot (possibly more than it should).  Third of all, game is extremely repetitve. You can move, you can burst, you see traps, and... that's it. There'll be a few variations of traps, granted. But the core gameplay won't change at all.  Lastly, dev isn't friendly at all -- I've seen people banned in the official discussions for calling dev rude (not even using any curse words whatsoever).  And, of course, as I've already mentioned, the price is inadequate for this product. For $10 you can buy a much better polished game with a lot less repetitive gameplay (especially during some sale).  Would I recommend buying this game? No, I would not. If this game would've costed around $1, maybe it'd be worth checking out (with all the bugs fixed, that is). So, if you enjoy platformers/runners/time attack games -- play some  Super Meat Boy , or something similar.",
