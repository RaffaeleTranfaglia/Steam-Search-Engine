            "review_text": "Like  Noby Noby Boy  and  Mountain , this is a toy more than a game. It's a constantly changing environment to interact with, where your cube bumps into stranger and stranger things as you explore the world further. You can influence the world in various ways, but it's a subtle, slow influence, especially compared to the industrious gardening of the game's other characters. So it's a zen game, something to switch off and relax with, an antidote to hours of  SpaceChem  brainburn. On another level, it's also a commentary on the psychology of achievements. Why collect coins that can never be spent? In a game about spreading colour and life, does it make sense to burn and kill things to unlock one achievement among a hundred?  I think this is going to to have limited appeal. In particular, if you absolutely need action, or character progression, or puzzles, or a story -- any of the things that constitute a game -- then look elsewhere. But in its best moments,  Cube &amp; Star  goes beyond all that to capture the feeling of ambling along the shore, picking up shells and bits of wrack.",

I'm not even near 100% yet, the map is mostly grey stil, I'm confused. I don't know what I'm supposed to do, what's expected of me, where I should go or what I'm even doing. I took a stab at decoding the tiny things language, that didn't help at all, I was still just as confused.  I'm sure this game gets good at some point but I just don't have the attention span to get there, and with great regret I have to put yet another title on my list of games I never completed.",

            "review_text": "It's an interesting concept that starts with some promise as you begin colouring the world, but boredom sets in as soon as you realize how slowly things progress and how large the world really is.  This has been described somewhat as a Zen game, but unlike other such games such as Flow, etc. there is little sense of progression and the pace is so very, very, slow. Nudge trees slowly, collect the colour that falls from them, and paint the world until the colour runs out. Repeat. It is the very definition of grinding, only with no real goal in sight.  There are some redeeming qualities: it is pretty, and the music is tranquil, fitting with the zen-like feel. Unfortunately that wears thin quickly as there is precious little actual game-play. The little bits of text you unlock are simply small statements designed perhaps to evoke deeper thought, but there really isn't much to them and they don't add much to the experience.   Some would say it is art, but to me it is a game without actual gameplay. Evocative statements and abstract graphics cannot make up for the fact that there is simply little to do, and what there is is so drawn out you would need to grind for hours and hours just to see it. It simply tries too hard.  The trailer shows all sorts of interesting parts of the game that I suspect are many hours away. Getting there is simply not that interesting, and takes too long.",

The clue in the game is, however, the four sign tower that are somewhere in the world. If you reach one of them and take it down, it'll give you a special power. One of those is to simply clear the space around your cube, but the other three are notes. Playing six notes, a combination of any of the three, or just two, or just one, will make different things happen. The previous sort of useless things that wander around will suddenly have a purpose and the clue will become more apperent. Or:  Plus: + uniqe + a lot of freedom + very calming and relaxing (the music too) + a big world with a lot of hidden stuff + gets interesting once you get the clue  Minus: - the clue is very vague - which makes the game vague somtimes.   Or, this is a love or hate game.",
