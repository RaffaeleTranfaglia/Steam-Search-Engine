            "review_text": "This is the sort of game you love to hate. It's gorgeous to look at, it's simple enough not to become a drudgery, yet it becomes really repetitive and boring in the mid-to-late game. It's not difficult by any means once you get the hang of it, and even though the in-game tutorial is miserable, there are already guides on Steam Community which are great at explaining 'do's and 'don't's.  Now, taking into consideration its price tag I can't really see the 'lack of content' other people are complaining about. It's advertised as 'short and sweet' and with 'no dark depressing story', and frankly, it delivers that 100%. Is it repetitive? Hell, yes! But at least it's not trying to fool you with a load of bull like 'intricate story' or 'deep character progression'.  Yes, you'll mostly play this for 3-4 hours max at the beginning then shelf it and go back to it for a couple of hours every month. But then again, it's exactly what a game that costs less than breakfast at Starbucks is supposed to do.",

            "review_text": "Management sim that oversees sending off strong heroes to fortify provinces, in order to bulk up for the final encounter, quite like in FTL: Faster Than Light. Mostly covers running a profitable guild with slider-focused gameplay like Democracy 3, but also throws in random elements, requires constant vigilance over regions and has sufficient RPG side content to try different play styles; all for a small price.

The Heroes are not unique enough, the story is lacking and the list goes on.  If the game was 'slower' in event build up with unlocking of more crisises and so on giving the player time to actually build up their forces and improve their heroes at a better pace it would be more fun.  Storyline quests and the like would have improved the game alot, as it is now it is sadly worse than It is a Wipe which is also a 'guild management' game and I hated that game.",
