            "review_text": "  SEUM: Speedrunners from Hell: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   Marty is an early-riser; he usually wake up at 11am. However, today it’s a late morning for Marty; after a struggle to find the edge of his bed and make his breakfast, it’s nearly midday! What a dreadful start to the day. It didn’t take long for our friend to rediscover his smile as soon as he sat down on his favourite sofa. Then a knock on the door . . . “Who the hell is knocking on my door so early this morning,” thought Marty? Before reaching the knob, the door violently pulverised itself, and a Demon appeared in front of him. The Demon is after Marty’s beer reserves and a mighty brawl ensues between them. Marty loses his right arm in the fight but manages to inflict a major blow to the Demon, who in turn loses an arm too! After stitching the demon’s arm to his own body, it is time to retrieve his beer reserves. . . Time to go to “HELL”  Seum: Speedrunners from Hell is a FPS/Platformer/Parkour where you play Marty, an easy-going person who has been robbed of his beer reserve by a demon from Hell!   After a cartoon-style introduction, you will arrive in Hell’s main menu. From here, you will be able to choose between 3 modes of play. The first one is single player; this mode consists of one hundred levels divided into nines floors. The main objective in each of the levels is to go as fast as you can to the round blue portal without dying, and to find the hidden beer can, too. When you reach the 10 levels in each floor, you will unlock the boss level and upon clearing this level, you will be able to jump on the elevator to go down deeper into hell!  The second mode is a speedrun parkour where you will need to clear all the levels from one floor as fast as you can, and the time will be added to the end of each level.  The last one is the endless level. In this mode, you will need to accumulate meters without dying - a Hell of a mode.  I really enjoy the gameplay; the levels are fast and short and they become ever more challenging as you travel down to hell. As I mentioned above, you have to go as fast as you can to the blue portal with a time limit. If you manage to do half way through the time limit you will score a “HELL YEAH” demon symbol on that level. Then you will need to restart the level to find the hidden beer can. You must have a specific number of beer cans and demon symbols on each floor to unlock the boss level and the elevator. Marty has the ability to shoot fireballs with his new arm (a Hell of an arm) but will also find on certain parkours a teleporting or a gravity ability to be able to reach the portal. And yes, you will have plenty of obstacles to avoid. You also have a leader board, so if you fancy seeing your name at the top, you will need to be superfast. This game is really fun!  Great graphics accompanied with a hard rock soundtrack. The controls are fine and responsive and the game is very addictive.   Positive: ~~~~~~   - Great graphics - Hell has 100 levels - 3 different modes of play - Well-designed levels - Achievements and trading cards  Negatives: ~~~~~~~~   - Frustrating at times - Some of the beer cans are really hard to spot  8.5/10  A little bit of Hell in your games library will not hurt!

Then I got contact with the developers and became a closed beta tester. I have to say this game is epic. You can have a lot of hour in this game by beating records and looking for hidden beers. The graphics are suit the game well. This is one of my favourites now and I think this game has a chance to become a future classic (At least for me). The music is so **** good. So actually the whole game in one is perfect in my opinion. I'm sure i'll have at least 100 hours in this game :)",

PROS: Redneck humor Rad setting Hell Reflex-centric gameplay Instant restarts Short, intense levels Cool powerups Community levels  CONS: Somewhat short More challenging levels locked behind collectables  SEUM follows a similar loop of short, brutal stages centered around reflex action and planning over multiple tries.

I would be soo happy if there was a user map pool, because we all know how creative a community can be with maps. But at the end it still i VERY good game",
