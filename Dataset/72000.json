            "review_text": "Closure is a platform-puzzle game in a very unique form.  It has a very beautiful and minimalist (and kind of creepy) design all in black and white and very good sound and music as well. The way the game works with the shadow/light is pretty cool, and the levels are very well design, some of them has more than one way to be completed or some 'secrets', and that's pretty cool.  The gameplay is pretty simple: you walk, grab some items, jump and enter the doors. That's it. The little tutorial in the beginning of the game is cool and teach that in a nice and practical way.  The light/shadow trick is the heart of the game, only the things that are in the light are visible and exists, you can't go out or place any object in the shadow. This is the point of most fun and sometimes frustration.  The idea of taking a light always with you to know and (literally) make your path is awesome, and very original. It is explored in many ways until the end of the game but there are levels that you will take so much time to you figure what to do and in the last moment you let go that beam of light and it's all lost because the key is gone in the dark.  The good point is that you can play it for 15 minutes or so, clear one or two levels and return later, because you will not have to learn all over again. It's pretty intuitive.  So, if you like some puzzles you should definitely try Closure, it is nice, simple, beautiful, original and challenging.",

            "review_text": "The fear of the dark is one of the most common phobias. But how many people really fear the dark, and not just the real or imagined threats it conceals? Certainly anyone who plays Closure, Eyebrow Interactive's wickedly creative indie game. In Closure's world, only what is visible exists-- step on a shadow and you'll fall right off the screen. To light a path through each level, the player must learn to use various arrangements of fixed, rotating, or portable light sources.  This is two-dimensional platforming like you've never seen before. Carry lamps to preserve the solid ground beneath you. Divide walls into stepping stones by lighting them in segments. Free trapped objects by temporarily eliminating obstructions from reality. Even across 72 levels, these inventive puzzles never fail to surprise.  Closure's spooky, greyscale style perfectly matches its central theme of light and shadow. Artist Jon Schubbe is responsible for the hallucinatory environments, which range from underground mines to deserted carnivals; Chris Rhyne provides the unearthly music and sound effects; and programmer Tyler Glaiel ties it all together. With no unnecessary parts, this game is an articulate, memorable experience.  The player takes control of three human characters throughout the game, each with their own backstory that is left open to interpretation. The player can also travel to the “hub world,” a land of doors occupied by an arachnid creature with horns and a hollow face, who gives access to the human protagonists. The difficulty ramps up smoothly when the levels are played in consecutive order, but if you get stuck in one world, you can use the hub world to jump to another.  Gamers exhausted by the frantic pace of many games will find relief in the methodical progression of Closure. No time limits or point scores here-- not even a Heads-Up Display. The game clearly wants you to share the unhurried pace of the protagonists as you explore their environments. Before proceeding through a level, it is sometimes necessary to study the paths taken by meandering globes of light, which I found to be a relaxing, almost meditative experience. If you're feeling impulsive, however, a fast respawn speed lets you experiment without punishment.  With Closure, Eyebrow Interactive proves that a game built around a single gameplay mechanic can offer not only an absorbing experience, but a re-playable one as well. To reach the game's many collectable items, players are often required to devise entirely new solutions to familiar puzzles. This results in a more sophisticated difficulty scale than traditional “easy” or “hard” modes, as players can choose their difficulty mid-level. That said, some of the later levels are mind-boggling. But a good challenge is healthy, and in a market saturated with mindless button-mashers, it is good to see a game that encourages thoughtfulness.  TL;DR -- Cool concept with a haunting aesthetic; smart puzzles that award creative solutions.",

            "review_text": "Closure is a puzzle game with an interesting hook. The objective is to get to the door at the end of each level. Some doors are locked requiring you to get a key to them before hand. If light is shining in an area, you can walk on it, leave objects there, or go into the door (assuming that you've unlocked it). If an area is in the dark, it ceases to exist and you can go through it. You spend the game manipulating light and dark to get to the exit of each level. Some levels have hidden secret moths (30 total spread across the 82 levels) you can collect which only serve to allow you to 100% the game and see the credits, a couple pictures and the developers thanking people, so don't bother with them. If you die during a level or screw up by losing the key, losing a crate, getting stuck, etc, you will restart the level. This can get annoying when you make a simple mistake such as jumping with a light orb to get on top of a crate, forgetting that the light will go away from beneath the crate and now the crate falls out of the level causing you to have to restart. You will make stupid mistakes like this pretty consistently throughout the game forcing you to have to restart levels, it can get annoying after a while. A rewind feature would've been nice to prevent you from having to restart levels for every minor mistake. Game took me around 7- 7 1/2 hours to complete 100%  There's no story, characters, or anything remotely interesting to keep you invested in the game. It's alright in terms of the puzzles, but if you're looking for anything interesting to happen so that you want to keep playing, don't bother with this game. Best when played in 15-30 minutes spurt, anything past that and you'll likely get bored and want to stop playing. Game is probably not worth getting, there're better puzzle games out there. Despite the positive reviews (87%), checking the achievements shows that about 47% of people completed the tutorial, but only 8.4% of people bothered completing the first set of 24 levels, and only 3.6% completed the game, so be wary of this game's positive rating.",

            "review_text": "The game itself is good; the main mechanic creative and well utilized, the puzzles are difficult but fair, the levels are varied and well-designed, and the art is beautiful. However, I can't recommend it in it's current state. The game has a major graphical glitch. If you have the wrong graphics card parts of the screen will be darker which renders some of the puzzles unsolvable. For example, at the begininng of a level the portion of the floor the character starts off on is missing causing you to fall into the abyss in an endless loop. Or a platform is missing but you don't know that so you wind up spending an unnessecarily long time trying to solve a puzzle that you didn't realize was glitched. You could go back and tweak the code but that renders the other puzzles unsolvable. Basically you have to back and forth between the code and the game every few levels. It really sucks the fun out of the game because you're never sure if you're failing a level because you did something wrong or because the game is glitched. If you want to play this game I recommend the free flash game instead. It's smaller, shorter, and harder than the Steam verison but at least you'll be able to finish it. Edit: I recently picked up Closure again and it works perfectly fine now. I haven't found a news about the game developers patching this bug on the Steam page. (If there is let me know and I'll edit this review). So I don't know if a computer update fixed the problem or the developers patched it or what.  Now that I've finshed the game I stand by what I said last year. The only new thing I have to add is the puzzles toward the end of each level are frustrating. Not because they're particularly hard but because some puzzles require an annoying level of prescison. I got stuck on puzzles I knew how to solve but I had to do them over and over again because I didn't put a spotlight in the exact position. Or because an object I needed bounced into the abyss becuase the platform it was suppose to land on was slightly too small.  That aside it's a fun game and it's worth playing. However, I'm keeping this rating until I get confirmation the glitch was formally fixed. At this point I'm not sure if the game actually works now or if I just got lucky.",

Gameplaydesign---mediocre Leveldesign--------good Narrative-----------mediocre Animations---------good Artdesign ----------very good Sounddesign-------good Technical----------mediocre =&gt; Personal (possibly subjective) verdict: 0.74 'good puzzle platformer' with 0.5 being mediocre. Recommended for puzzleplatformer enthusiasts. You might play in short bursts only, due to the games grim atmosphere. &lt;3 Closure is an intriguing little 2d puzzle platformer set in a grim but gorgeous black and white lovecraftian setting. It has the very innovative twist that things wich aren't illuminated simply don't exist. You start of as an adorable spider demon in the main hub area, where you can access different worlds filled with multiple levels. In each world, the spider demon gets into the role of a different protagonist until you play as the demon himself, tying up relations among the characters. Apart from beating all the levels, you can collect hidden 'moths' which will unlock 'a little revelation' (nothing to crazy) at the end of the game. ; ) &lt;3 Gameplaydesign/ Leveldesign: While responsive, the movement is quite basic and does not feel particularly great. But that did not really impact my experience in a negative way, since the main mechanic is not platforming but rather the interesting light and shadow puzzles. There you will make your journey through the various levels by manipulating lights in many different ways in order to reach the door out. The developers managed to explore this mechanic quite well and came up with a lot statisfying and intelligent puzzles. The game offers a good amount of levels, most of them unique in their own way. The dificulty is increasing throughout the entire game and will even challange experienced players. &lt;3 The Narrative of closure is delivered entirely through environments and achievements (by revealing area names etc). The games story is very subtle, obscure and completely up to interpretation as there is not even an official stand. While being intriguing, it may leave a less observant player quite disappointed. &lt;3 Animations: The hand drawn character animations and effects are very charming and look great. : ) &lt;3 Artdesign: The environments and characters are presented white on black with a very high contrast. The lovecraftian theme is expertly executed and makes for a very mysterious and grim feeling. &lt;3 Sounddesign: The excellent atmospheric music easily makes up for the rather simple soundeffects and contributes greatly to the games tense atmosphere. The music is mixed up in theme and volume but might become repetetive on longer brainfarts. &lt;3 Technical: You can rebind keys wich is nice because the default keyboard controls appeared odd to me. You get multiple resolution options up to 1080p, although some of the art appears to be in 720p regardless (I might be wrong). Volume sliders are there too. I experienced quite a lot of physics based glitches when I was playing on my low powered ultrabook which might be a result of framerate issues. The game ran decently without any bugs or glitches on my PC however. &lt;3 END",

            "review_text": "Closure is a puzzle game that I have found myself playing far too much during the last week or so.   The main idea of the game is that  illumination  is everything. Anything that is not illuminated you cannot see and thus it does not exist. This means that in order to walk around you need to make sure that there is a light source anywhere enabling you to see the floor. This also means that you can pass through walls and other obstacles by making sure that they are kept in the dark. Thus, in order to progress in the game, the player has to think a lot about how to place the lightbulbs and where to direct the lamps, so that the next door can be reached.  The importance of illumination is also reflected in the beutifully aesthetic artwork in the game. It is refreshing to play a game with such large amounts of darkness, making the rooms in the game feel both infinite in extent and cramped at the same time. In combination with the fittingly moodful music, it creates an eerie atmosphere throughout the game making the impression that there is an important story being told in the game. The problem is that I cannot in any way understand the meaning of it, but I still need to solve the next puzzle (and the next) in order to find  closure  in the end.  After the unusually well-made tutorial, three doors are presented. Behind each door lies a different world (factory, hospital, carnival), each containing 24 levels with, in general, progressively more advanced puzzles. There are, however, some puzzles that are really difficult to solve lying out of order of the general progression, but none of them were impossible to solve, even for a novice puzzle gamer like I am.  I really enjoyed playing this game, and I recommend it to anyone who likes atmospheric games with puzzles requiring some serious thinking, and who can put up with, at times, somewhat over-arty game design choices.",

I refuse to look up the answers to the puzzles, but have made it about half way on each of the 3 doors in the hub area. This is a great puzzler with a very creepy atmoshpere. I will however come back (after letting my mind refresh to try to beat the puzzles again).",
