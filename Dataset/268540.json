            "review_text": "I found this to be a very charming point-and-click adventure game. The focus of the story is on a depressive child clown by the name of Sadwick, who departs from his family circus to avert the end of the world from coming to pass.  The story is more of a whimsical one, but the game is not a comedy and does take itself seriously. You get a nice amount of character growth from Sadwick and the course of the story has you meet new and interesting characters in each scene along the way. The amount of depth to each character you meet was pleasantly surprising, and at least a few really made for some happy smile-inducing moments and the German voice acting is quite expressive (see my note below) . The environments are very beautifully drawn and in-game animations are very good too. There are some cutscenes which have less polish, looking maybe more like a 90's cartoon but overall did not detract from the experience for me. The music is quite good, even if some of the tracks are re-used a few too many times.  Game ran just fine, but doesn't alt-tab too well. Saving, mouse controls, the GUI are all perfectly fine. The game has no failstates, and you can hold Spacebar to highlight interactables. This game does have a fair few number of puzzles that are not easy to intuit the solutions for, so you will likely have to resort to a guide more often than you'd like. This is par for the course in adventure games, although the par is a bit high in this game.   I also wanted to address a few complaints I saw a lot in other people's reviews.  Performance : Many users complained of the game failing to launch, launching to a black screen, or crashing. I never once had any such issue. I hope others who do are able to resolve theirs.  Sadwick's walking speed : Some users complained that Sadwick walks too slow. In most adventure games you can double-click on screen transitions to automatically trigger them. You can do that in this game too, so its possible those users did not know. Sadwick walks at a fine pace otherwise, no scene is especially large bar one and even then the transitions in that area are numerous.  Voice acting : I heard that the English dub VA for Sadwick is unbearable and whiny. Given his personality in the game I could see why this might be, so I used the original German voice acting and enjoyed it thoroughly. I have no problems with using the German VA.  Broken audio : Some users comment that audio seems to cut off abruptly at the end of some spoken lines. I cannot comment on the English audio, but this is sometimes noticeable in the German audio. I did not find it common enough nor disruptive enough to say it was any significant detriment, although the developers should fix it if so.  Controls : Some users complain the game fails to register mouse clicks. I never had this happen, but you do have to hold down the mouse button to open the small interaction menu.  Story : Some people just don't like the premise or character personality, or how the game ends. That's fine, its just down to taste. I enjoyed it, others will not.   All in all, I would recommend it. I very much enjoyed myself. About 10-12 hrs playtime.",

            "review_text": "  If you like point and click games I think you should already know that Daedalic Entertainment are the masters of this genre. And The Whispered World: Special Edition doesn't disappoint in the eyes of fans. I have to be honest with you, I've encountered none of the problems reported by the earlier reviewers. I don't know whether they have been patched or not by this time, but my experience in the game leads me to believe that they have been.  In this game, we follow the journey of Sadwick, a want-to-be hero with clinical depression, who discovers that he has been fated to destroy the world. As you can imagine, he rejects this prophesy, determined instead to save the world from crumbling to dust. Sadwick is a clown in the fantastical realm of Silentia, where he travels with a circus featuring only his brother, his grandfather, and himself. His life consists only of menial chores, burping the alphabet for audiences, and playing the cannonball in the headlining human cannonball act. His brother despises him and his senile grandfather forgets he exists. So yeah, he's a pretty lonely and depressive character. The game is full of dark jokes like 'This statue ain't moving. Pretty much like everything else in my life.' which is pretty funny and emotional at the same time. You will find yourself asking a lot of times if you should cry of laughter or maybe of sadness. Also, Spot, the caterpillar, is his handsome sidekick and the only friend he has, but they are a great team together. The main character complains about a lot of problems but he tries to do everything in his power to don't leave things undone. He's not your casual hero that likes making promises and breaking them after. He doesn't care about fame and glory. He just wants to fix the big end of the world problem. The nightmares that he has been having turnes out to be a good excuse to start exploring the world in which he lives. So that's how his adventure begins.  The world created by the developers is vibrant, creative and beautifully brought to life through the eyes of Sadwick. And while many complain that the ending was awful, the story really got into me and let me tell you that it will have a very emotional impact on you too. Like any Daedalic Entertainment game would do.   Pros",

As a bonus there is a developers commentary on each screen (mostly includes puzzle spoilers).  The only negative point is the voice-acting of the main character 'Sadwick'. He is so sad that he gets annoying after a while.",

But you kind of got use to it even thou i understand the irritation that comes with a enoying, depressing maincharacter. The only chapter I didn't enjoy so much was chapter 3... Really enoying pussles, it just felt like you walked around in circles... But othervise a really good game and a good story!",

            "review_text": "So I actually enjoyed this game. It's got great aspects for a standard point and click advanture, but just has a bunch of issues in there. I'll probably try the next game from Whispered World, but you need to know these things before you play:  1. You won't be able to listen to the english voice acting, it's unbearable. It's an extreme amount better with german audio and english subtitles. Much more enjoyable. That's how I played through this.  2. The save screen doesn't show where you are in the game for some reason, you just have to remember what time you saved and where.  3. The ending is a gigantic cop-out.  Other than that, this game is enjoyable. Here are complaints people may have:  -Sadwick walks too slowly. This is avoidable by double clicking the next area, you'll go there instantly. You still have to walk over to places where you want to interact with an area, but traversing areas is very fast.  -Autoscroll is wonky in places. This isn't huge, but is annoying.  However, the game has:  -Beautiful background art  -Well done character design and animation  -A fitting soundtrack albeit not super memorable   As much as I'd like to recommend this game, you really have to make an effort to enjoy it after the big 3 issues mentioned earlier. Chapter 2 is slow and a bit painful, but the other three are quite good. The ending of chapter 4 (end of the game) is almost impossible to figure out without a walkthrough. The very end of the game is totally out of place and somewhat clichéd. It doesn't fit the game and I didn't feel like it should have been there. Didn't really give closure.  The achievements aren't too demanding, but you should check the achievement guide before starting, because some you may have to do a second run to get if you don't do it right.",

It's a pain in the ♥♥♥ at times to figure out the different solutions, but it all is solvable, given a bit of thinking and a few hours of try and error.  Where it gets to me is the part where the solution is a random sliding puzzle. I have no problem with try and error, but a sliding game that's just sliding tiles around for hours on end... That for me was a real game-killer. Every other puzzle was fashioned in a way that you could get it done either with a bit of leg work or exploring a bit more to look for the stuff you missed. But this sliding ♥♥♥♥♥.. After looking at the same plate for just 5 minutes, I was allready tired of trying to solve that part. And it's randomized as well, so every game presents a unique solution to this.  I like puzzles, but I don't fancy spending my spare time sliding around tiles, possibly for hours and hours..  On that basis alone, it kind of ruined the rest of the otherwise brilliant game for me.",
