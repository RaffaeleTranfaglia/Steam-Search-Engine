            "review_text": "First impression: generic casual time management game  They seem to have much the same mechanics as similar games from Alawar and elsewhere: clear obstacles in the road, harvest resources, build houses, click on approaching enemies, get mana to activate powerup spells. It's not better than most time management games I've seen, but then again, it's not much worse than most, either. There's no challenge in beating the timer for me, and on the other hand I'm not motivated to beat the dev time.  I'm basically thumbing this one down because it doesn't deserve a 100% score, which it now has. If you like this type of game, sure, go ahead and buy it, but personally, I'm uninstalling after I've done 6 levels in under 50 minutes.    This game runs fine on my old Windows XP computer. ",
