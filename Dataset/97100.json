BUT your in luck the game is still 100% playable, it has offline modes for all maps and game modes with as many bots as your computer can handle. you just need to find the right .ini file and change the max settings for bots. its a faily simple process that i was surprised i couldn't find online, maybe wasn't looking in the right place. oh well.   anyways its a good game with a good offline mode! but be warned the online is pretty dead at this time of the review and also a BIG side note i downloaded the DLC but the GFWL wont install it for some reason... I have yet to be able to play my DLC i purchased which is irratating, but the game is still fully playable 8/10",

The graphics are a tad better and there is more features, but it still feels like the first game, which is not a bad thing. Both are very pleasant to play and provide a lot to do. Prejudice has a 5 hour single-player, which is pretty average now-a-days, but it's multiplayer provides many more hours of boisterous gameplay. You can make 7 classes for plenty styles of play, all matches last a long time, not just TDM or CTF and you can call in a lot of support items such as hover bikes, mech suits, and artillery. GFWL could provide some issues, but so far it has not been a problem for me. Overall Section 8: Prejudice is fun. Sort of generic, but that's not entirely a bad thing. You'll have fun with it.",

Such a shame for such a good game. It has great coop too...  Also there is no spawn timer because you spawn in orbit and crash down without a parachute to any point the map. And if you land on someone you instantly kill them. If you ever wanted to feel like Iron Man, this is the game to do it. WHY did it not sell well? WHY?

            "review_text": "I poured 100s of hours into this game on Xbox 360, I love this game almost as much as some of the AAA titles ive played. so understand how dissapointed i was to see that after i installed it and all the dlc, how it said the words, 'Since you have not signed into a profile, NONE of your progress will be saved.' I learned that this game was run by Windows LIVE, and since that has gone away, there is no way for me to create such a profile, i could care less about the multiplayer shutting down, but i would at least like to save my damn progress. or at the very least create some ♥♥♥♥ing classes for bot mode or something, this is ridiculous steam, you shouldve at least warned me before i spent 30 bucks on childhood nostalgia that is broken.",
