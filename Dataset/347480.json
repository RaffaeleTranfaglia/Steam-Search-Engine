Don't listen to reviews that say that the game's controls aren't good because most of the people who wrote the reviews for this game didn't even beat the 2nd level set. It does takes a little bit to get the controls down but don't give up if you get a frustrated, just take a break.  Pros:  Quick fun and challenging game.  Dev is constantly working on improving his game and talks to community.  Okay music.  Cons:  A bit repetitive. Some achievements seem to not work but dev is working on it.",
