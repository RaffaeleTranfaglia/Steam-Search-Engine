            "review_text": "EDIT: They only recently added Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders, so this is outdated. Also to clarify: I meant genuine political games that aren't meme tastic.  Political games are hard to come by on Steam. This one, I was very disappointed by.  First of all, I understand that it's in Early Access. No brainer whatsoever. But the dire selection of characters from the get go is disappointing. We're even given the option to play Obama? This is over Bernie Sanders or Ted Cruz, or whoever. I'm not expecting Political Machine levels of depth but it's silly. Especially when I run against Trump, Obama and another weird version of Hillary? It feels like a lack of care has gone into it.  The lock feature is broken as hell, I can't secure my city at all. The character models look ugly. Trump has cargo pants? Hillary doesn't look like Hillary? They have a really annoying squeaky effect on voices, I'd rather have the unaltered voice. Animations for the UI aren't good. Game mechanics aren't properly explained.  Also the AI is so dumb. This is barely a review because this is barely a game.",
