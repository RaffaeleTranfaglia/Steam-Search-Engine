Production value is incredibly low on some elements, some voice overs sound like the developers mates reading a script. A lot of potential in this concept but at present it feels thrown together into a minimum viable product and sold, much like the developers previous game only this time there is no human interaction to create anything resembling meaningful gameplay. I am refunding.",

I was reserving a few pieces because I didn't need them, and I was waiting to see which direction/area would need support. But this yahoo decides to distract me, and start placing the pieces for me.   ",
