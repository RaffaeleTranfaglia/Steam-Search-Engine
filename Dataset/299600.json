            "review_text": "As someone who kickstarted DFS, I have to admit that I'm impressed with the game so far. Considering this is Grimm Bros.' first game, it's a lot of fun and has a lot of charm packed into its story. It's got flaws (the UI, the crafting), but roguelike fans should still get a kick out of it.  PROS: - Three game modes (Story, Survival, Endless Labyrinth) - Two difficulties (Normal and Hardcore/Permadeath) - Unlockable characters in Endless Labyrinth - Controller support (and it feels great now, thanks to patch) - Pets to collect, up to two in your party - Crafting and fishing systems to play around with (fishing bug has been patched) - The dungeon areas have a lot of little secrets - Devs are listening, taking in feedback, and releasing patches to fix major issues  CONS: - Crafting UI is awful. - Menu system needs to be reworked - Not enough information in battle - Dungeons can feel 'cluttered' and sometimes tricky to see/escape - A lack of keybindings - Storage space is small  SUBJECTIVE: - The game can be difficult as hell (For me, a huge pro) - The aesthetics (bright/vibrant colors!)  Having put some time into it, I can definitely recommend this to fans of the roguelike genre. The combat mixes in melee with ranged. Pets provides some tactical advantage since it allows for flanking/backstabbing, and they have leveling independent from your own. You've got a rage meter, magic spells, and a crafting system to play around with. Scattered throughout the dungeons themselves are traps, switches that benefit or harm, rare merchants that sell crazy stuff, switches that create surprises when hit in the right order, and more.  And now to clarify some of the cons.  Most of these are small gripes. Admittedly, a lack of keybindings does hurt the game, especially since you're forced to navigate the (rather simple) menu in order to access Inventory, Equipment, Magic, etc. Adding keys to individually open up these specific menus would be great, but it's a small issue since the menu is easy enough to navigate. Also, you DO have storage space - but it's not terribly large and you may run out of space fairly quickly. Fellow packrats, be warned.  The crafting UI, on the other hand, is just plain bad. Your learned complex recipes (gear and such) are on the left-hand side and this is fine. However, simpler recipes such as creating planks out of raw wood, or the number of zinc required to make an ingot, are absent. Either memorization or documentation is needed for these, unless I'm missing something obvious. Additionally, you can only craft one item at a time. When crafted, it's required to move the finished product out of the 'completed' slot before crafting the next one. It's tedious as hell and really needs to be modified.  Additionally, the menu doesn't need an Inventory screen. It's redundant when compared to the Equipment screen. Combat, while a lot of fun, also just doesn't give you enough information on your enemies and pets. You can't check individual pet HP, you can't scroll through enemy HP to prioritize them (a problem when in a crowd, since it could be a bit tricky to make out which bar belongs to who). I'm still wrapping my head around terrain bonuses, which would have benefitted from some kind of mouse-over or something. In short, the UI needs love. Lots of it.  CLOSING: Overall, I personally feel that the game feels FUN despite its flaws, although (once again) you need to be a fan of roguelikes. This game is *hard.* If you enjoyed Dungeons of Dredmor, Izuna, Shiren the Wanderer, etc. then there's a good chance you'll enjoy what's here.  That and the idea of Red Riding Hood traipsing through the woods, cheerfully murdering monsters is an idea that appeals to me.  As stated before, this is Grimm Bros.' first game. It's kinda rough, it's by no means perfect, but it's a solid title. I gave the devs my money and put my faith in them, and I've got faith that they'll keep updating/supporting this title by making it shine even more. Patches have already been shoved through the pipeline and they're checking their forums as well as Steam's.  Will update this review as necessary.  Edit: Added some details on the dungeon-crawling and removed the detail saying that DFS has farming. There is NO farming, I was writing this at 4am and had just finished a surreal dream about Kevin Costner. Also, my biggest cons have been patched, so huzzah! DEFINITELY recommend it now!",

            "review_text": "This game is honestly amazing. Dragon fin soup took an approach to combat and crafting that I've never seen before in a Roguelike. Guns, bombs, spells, booze and adult humor everywhere. The difficulty is challenging, Crafting items is a treat, with recipes as of the latest patch being numerous, rewarding and shared between all playthroughs. The game became incredibly replayable, especially on the Survival modes.   With that said, when the game launched there were problems with the UI being a bit clunky and recipes were hard to come by, but the developers are very responsive to player feedback and the UI was patched to perfection and recipes reworked to be shared between all playthroughs. The quick response has me feeling hopeful for future content from this game and its devs.",

            "review_text": "I have only played this game for an hour or so, but I enjoyed it contrary to the other reviews. Here is why.  I was one of the kickstarter backers for this game. I was aware from the screenshots what kind of game it will be but I took a risk and backed it anyhow. The way the game is built is like it is one big Final Fantasy tactics map, but unlike that kind of game, the 'step by step' map system is active even outside of battles. This may be frustrating at times but also fun as it gives you the feeling that you are playing the game the whole time, as opposed to feeling that you are playing a challenge only when battles arise. At times you will find the movement clunky, especially if you are using joypad, but you could always use the mouse to select where to go and she will go there automatically, or u can destroy the trees and obstacles in your path to create your own path, collecting loot as you do so.  If you can get past the clunkiness and accept that the game was intentionally created this way, there is a deep sense of fun and involvement. I like the world and the idea. A drunken 'red riding hood' and her pet wolf working as mercenaries for hire while also trying to discover her past. The artwork, character and mood of the ambient music makes u feel very involved. Remember, when you feel stuck or can't get past some place, that means there is something u need to do or figure out. Whether it is a puzzle or simply needing to destroy the obstacle down to keep moving, any obstacles or 'clunkiness' in the game is intentional. It feels this way.  Overall it is a fun experience if you want to try something new and wiling to get past the default preconceptions of how a game SHOULD be. The obstacles and clunkiness are no different than the frustration one feels when you play the original megaman games and you realize that you can't duck. :) It is part of the game  Also knowing that this game was made by 5 indie developers, they did quiet a good job. Also the artwork and world inspired by the Grimm Brothers' tales really connects to me. :)  To sum up  Pros: -Lovely Artwork -New Idea -Involving gameplay -Interesting Music -Loveable characters -Nice contradiction between a colorful world and a moral-less culture -You get better at it the more you play it -Some puzzles are not explained and you feel a sense of satisfaction when you figure them out on your own -It feels like one big game as opposed to separate layouts for battles and walking the map (turned based environment, like one big chess board) -Tons of looting. There is crafting too but haven't tried it yet. :) - Even though it is a rogue-like game, the default storymode offers you an option to restore when dead as well as saves, so you have the choice between playing a normal game in story mode or a permadeath game in survival mode. :)  Cons: -Not what you expect it at first to be -the clunky turned based movement takes you off guard at first -no tutorial whatsoever. The instructions are with the manual included with the game. I got it as a kickstarter backer. Not sure if it's included with steam purchase (update: discovered the manual exists in the main menu under the title 'Read or Die' :) ) -can make u feel confused at times and wondering if you are doing the right thing -puzzles not being explained can be frustrating to some people  Overall if you give it a chance you find yourself enjoying it. There was definitely effort invested in this game. I personally enjoyed it. Feel free to see which cons and pros matter more to you before you purchase it. :)  I personally give it 7/10 :)",

First off, this game is terrific if you're a strategic gamer, but you still like games like Diablo. Because each step is a turn, it is very easy to stop the action any time you need to and the game goes at the speed that YOU decide. The crafting system is really top notch. All in all I have really enjoyed the game and thoroughly recommend it!!",

Pros: +Addictive gameplay (slay enemies, collect loot, level up your char, get better gear etc.) +Sh!t tons of content for a supposedly little indie game (lots of different: maps/places, enemies, items, amount of craftable items etc.) +Funny dialogues and NPC names +Several gamemodes +Storymode takes quite a while to complete +Discworld references (the world is placed on the back of a giant turtle swimming through the multiverse!)  Cons: -Lack of proper instructions in the beginning and a not very helpful help-menu (controls seem to be terribad first, but they're easy-po-peeze once you figured them out)  -♥♥♥♥♥♥ menu-controls -Missions are rather simple and become repetitive after a while -UI lacks infos (for example, if you attempt to craft a weapon, it doesnt show its stats or level requirement...so you often end up crafting stuff that turns out to be worthless junk)   Big phat thumbs up from me!!1!1",

            "review_text": "  So, I have a few things to say about this game.  I have to give credit in a couple areas, but unfortunately it just doesn't save the game for me. The music is pretty good, the art is really cute and aethetically pleasing. I've only played for a couple hours, but to be honest I couldn't really stomach playing it for longer.  Why?  The movement feels clunky. Despite watching videos and other people stream the game, I still wasn't sure in the end if I was even playing the game 'right.' It felt uncomfortable and was not easy to slide in to, as it should be. The writing is done in such a way that it almost treats the audience as if they are dumb, and cannot infer information based on decently written dialogue. The mini map was not helpful or well 'mapped out' at all. I had no idea what the game was trying to indicate to me with its' little green squares for everything they were trying to mark.   Further, a little bit of a pet peeve about this game: you have to pay money if you damage stuff. That sounds logical maybe, but listen -- most of us have been conditioned to break things if we see we are damaging them. We want to see what goodies are inside! (I broke a stump had to pay money. You should be paying me; I removed that nuisance from your yard.) And due to this mechanic, I basically started the game bankrupt. Furthermore, what I was doing felt empty. Boring. Pointless. I didn't feel engaged. Make it matter to me, because right now, it just doesn't.   I did have some interaction with the devs and I have to say that for the most part, they are some pretty nice people. Unfortunately, that doesn't make for what I consider to be a 'good game', all due respect.",

Also, I couldn't use mouse to attack or interact for some reason, so it had to be an Enter key. Considering u still need a mouse ingame, playing with both hands on a keyboard is not an option.",

Last patch fixed a bunch of things that made the game unbearable to play, but now that the controls aren't wonky anymore it's just the game itself that's unbearable and that isn't fixable.  Game decides to start pitting you against things 5+ levels above you almost immediately. Spent the last hour trying to not die on a randomly generated map involving werewolves that would spawn with no warning completely surrounding you and making it impossible to not just eat attacks from all sides until you die. Provides no information on your goals, or how to possibly make things easier for yourself, or possibly explain to you why maybe it's you that sucks at the game.  Can't change any of your options once you start the game, you have to save, quit to menu, edit things from the menu and very likely have to restart the game entirely just to change those settings.  Menu navigation is still garbage, entering or closing out of menus takes multiple clicks and the game often gets mad at you for attempting to use the mouse despite it generally being required.  May be the worst thing I've Kickstarted so far.",

Loaded it up day 1  First thing i noticed was the big lack of options to configure the game how id like.   1. 1920x1080 resolution was a pain to enable 2. Controls are down right awful. Mouse is way to sensitive and nearly impossible to control, Gamepad on the other hand lacks precision as well and doesnt seem to have the option to do stuff turn based??? (i couldnt figure out how) 3. Get MASSIVE screen tearing when i run the game fullscreen (even forcing vsync through the drivers) 4. The entire game seems to have this annoying 'fog' filter taking the would be colorful crisp art and graphics and making them look like you are playing with your screen submerged in a bowl of soup. .. hey.. dragon fin soup? 5. Conversation bubbles and alerts often pop up and vanish way too quickly. 6. The UI is awful. Not at all intuitive 7. YOU CANT CHANGE OPTIONS DURING THE GAME!!!! 8. Most video options require you to quit the game entirely and restart. Even just to change the resolution? hello 1993!!!  As of right now, im done. Im gonna wait for about 3 or 4 major patches before I try this game again. Its just way too glitchy and unfinished feeling for me to try to fight with the controls, the UI, and the rest of the game system. I recommend you wait as well. If it improves, ill gladly change my review. Ill be grabbing this for free on psplus as well, just to see if this is a PC port fiasco, or it suffers from the same problems.",
