            "review_text": "Games ok, really easy to pick up on. The 'DNA' factor is random, and getting stronger monsters is a way through breeding. There is very little control that you the player has to do. you set up your monsters and let them go at other monsters. I think a young kid could play this game quite easily. I'm not sure if theirs any Crossbreeding. since it tells me there are no available partners at the moment. but with in 30 minutes I am using the Skip Button for combat. There is no control there you just have to Hope RNG serves you well. ALL combat is RNG, the only thing you control is unit placement. and hopefully you have a tank in the right slot since it gets targeted the most.   In the begining there is not much to do. breed until you have 4 monsters and try to do quests. There is no level factor so Exploration is a hit or miss factor based on RNG.",

But ottherwise the artwork is cute, but it is too much work to get it.",
