            "review_text": "Nostalgia!  This Half Life expansion takes a different spin. Instead of playing a Black Mesa personal you are Corporal Adrian Shepard and you are task to hunt down Gordon Freeman and terminate him. You think it would be easy, instead just like the Black Mesa personal you are thrown into the chaos that is wrecking havoc all across the facility and just like everyone else. You must fight your way through the facility and survive.   This game adds a lit bit of something new to the game. Not only new alien species. But also team effort. Your AI squad mates that are dotted throughout the huge complex. Be warn however there are some instances that they MUST SURVIVE if they die then you will have to start all over again from where you last save. So keep them alive and work with them.  This game adds more puzzle and more exploration to the huge facility which is always nice. The only minor complaint is the senstivity in some cases it can get really annoying or dizzy when doing these physical puzzles (jump, crouch jump) those sort of puzzles. Unlike in the previous games where the looking senstivity and what not seems more slower. So beware of that.  If you are a Half Life fan and want a taste of of military action. Half Life style. This game is recommended",

The events in this game run parallel to the original so it's great to see how the other storylines unfold from a different perspective. There are a load of new weapons added and also a few new enemies to encounter. At times you will also have a squad to help you out which really gives gives the feel for some epic battles when it's your squad versus a horde of monsters. If you're itching for more Half-Life then this is a must play and is an awesome addition to Half-Life series.",

            "review_text": "An excellent expansion pack from developer Gearbox! I wonder how many of us still know what expansions were... nowadays these extra stories would come in the form of DLCs not an expansion pack. It meant to indicate a longer story and this is definitely a bigger pack than a dlc which can be a single weapon or a new costume for a character in the game.  In any case, Opposing Force puts us in the shoes of a corporal, a certain Adrian Shepard, who - along with his fellow soldiers - is sent to neutralise the enemies invading the Black Mesa facility. As expected, things go awry and you are alone facing the good-old aliens. There is a new assortment of weapons, new enemies and new music. Oh, and there are fat security officers helping you!  By the way: the game comes with widescreen settings and vsync can be switched on! Just excellent!  A relatively long and challenging expansion pack that comes very cheap. It did age a lot throughout the 15 years but it is still a great game... at least for reminiscing purposes.",

            "review_text": "Half-Life: Opposing Force is an expansion pack for Valve Software's science fiction first-person shooter video game Half-Life. The game was developed by Gearbox Software and Valve Corporation and published by Sierra Entertainment, it was released on November 19 1999 Opposing Force is the first expansion for Half-Life. Opposing Force returns to the same setting as Half-Life, but instead portrays the events from the perspective of a U.S. Marine, one of the enemy characters in the original game.   The you take on the role of, Adrian Shephard, who is sent in to neutralize the Black Mesa Research Facility when a scientific mishap causes it to be invaded by aliens, but quickly finds that the Marines are outnumbered and slowly being beaten back by a second alien race and black operations units. As an expansion pack for Half-Life, Opposing Force is a first-person shooter. The overall gameplay of Opposing Force does not significantly differ from that of Half-Life: you are required to navigate through the game's levels, fight hostile non-player characters and solve a variety of puzzles to advance.   There are also a lot of new weapons for use in single player and multiplayer, again you see everything through the first person perspective of the protagonist and remains in control of the character for almost all of the game. Story events are conveyed through the use of scripted sequences rather than cut scenes. Multiplayer, well lets just say it's the same as the original Half-Life's but this time every map from the original game are in this one!.   The HD pack is compatable with this too with a lot of new weapons and maps in the multiplayer, I played LAN with one of my friends and thought it was like an updated Half Life multiplayer. Overall I would rate this game a 9/10 brilliant story and multiplayer, I am absolutely 100% sure that Half-Life Opposing Force will absolutely blow you away!",

            "review_text": "Amazing 1st expansion to the notoriously great Half-Life. Brand new storyline that ties into the original. The rest of this review will contain spoilers. You are Adrian Shepard, a marine whose mission in the beginning is unknown. We eventually find out it's to kill Gordon Freeman. You crash into Black Mesa, and near the beginning (I forget if it's like the third chapter or something) you hear a scientist say 'Hurry up Gordon, I can't keep it open any longer!' And we run into Gordon Freeman in the flesh. Spoiler mode: deactivated. The two storylines intertwine to make this whole complex thing that is hard to keep up with. But, keep an open mind and pay attention, and you just might get it. Opposing Force has everything Half-Life has to offer, and then some, such as new weapons, new survival tactics, and new enemies. I wouldn't be able to decide which one of the two is better, but I do know some people who chose this game, even though it's shorter. I don't know. Purchase and play it, and maybe you'll be one of those people.",

            "review_text": "Half-Life: Opposing Force is an expansion pack for the 1998 sci-fi horror game, Half-Life. Like its predecassor, it takes place... blah, blah, blah... Let's just say there's no reason to come to this game other than you wanting to continue your month long Half-Life marathon, and if you've already played the first Half-Life. With that said, you should have mastered the game mechanics of the Goldsrc engine by this point, and the game shouldn't take you over 20 hours to beat unless you're playing on all the difficulties. I, personally, ALWAYS choose Normal because it's not like I feel Easy mode is for noobs or anything, but from a game that's an expansion pack of a game that's 95% identical in terms of gameplay, you should probably choose Normal mode for this one. Another possible reason you walk into this game is because of the main character, Adrian Shepherd, possibly being in the next Half-Life game (♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ IT, VALVE! COUNT!), and you wanting to know the backstory... assuming you STILL haven't played Opposing Force while you're still trying to get past that terrifying Strider battle in Half-Life 2: Episode Two. Oh, sorry... spoilers.  So, my personal thoughts on the game itself... Honestly... I think it's awesome.   Pros: It may be shorter than the original gem, but that's to be expected from an expansion pack. And it REALLY does add to the Half-Life canon, people! I know all those people out there who are all 'constructive' and argue how this game has absolutely no bearing on the Half-Life canon whatsoever. Wrong. VERY wrong. First of all, this game actually gives a LOT of information on the G-Man, who had to destroy Black Mesa, and everyone in it soon after Gordon teleported to Xen to destroy the Nihilanth, to avoid controversy over the Resonance Cascade in the future (that works out well...). It gives the G-Man a sense of purpose in the Half-Life canon and tells us about him. How he works, his dark personality, and his sinister actions. The game is also... like every Half-Life game... extremely addicting, considering it's also sort of a puzzle game... again, like every Half-Life game.  Cons: It feels long and epic, but SLIGHTLY lacks in the originality department. Besides Race X, the G-Man's major role, and the ever so cliffhanger ending, the game occasionally just feels like a port of Half-Life in someone else's point of view, who ALSO happens to be another one of the good guys. Nope, you don't get to see why you have to fight the Gene worm at the final boss, it just HAPPENS. I mean, don't get me wrong, the boss is great but... *sigh*... never mind. What else do I consider a con? Chapter 4... I just don't like Chapter 4... 'SONOFA♥♥♥♥♥SOMANY♥♥♥♥INGBLACKOPSANDHOOORIBLEAI! GOOOOOOOOOOODDDDD!' Sorry, that's just the transcript of my first playthrough in hard mode... *sigh*... so many black ops folk...  Overall, Half-Life: Opposing Force can be summed up in 5 words... It's better than Blue Shift.  8.999999999999... oh,screw it, 9/10.  ",

You just get climbable ropes, new type of helpers and guns. However as the story unfolds you really appreciate the 'second view' thing, and I'm not talking only about revisiting old locations and Gordon Freeman appearances. I don't want to reveal too much but let's just say playing Opposing Force you suddenly realize from where some Half Life 2 and even Portal things came from. I haven't expected the story to be so much related to previous and future Half Life games because the development was outsourced to  Gearbox Software  (Borderlands series).  Corporal Shephard rather fights than brains his way through obstacles so the arsenal is pushed to the limit, both conventional and weird weapons.  Flashlight is replaced with night vision goggles. This allows to keep fighting in pitch black areas.   So it is still the same 'ol Black Mesa facility environment, but minor changes alters the gameplay enough to give it new feel.   Opposing Force is a very pleasant conclusion to the original Half Life story.",

Your mission doesn't exactly go as planned, though, and you soon find yourself as just one combatant in a conflict that gets nastier by the minute.  There is working multiplayer with some servers up, and surprisingly enough new levels seem to have been added in addition to the original ones. All but one are either free-for-all deathmatch or team-based CTF. There is one team-based control point-style map.   Aside from a snazzy new HUD, and some great new weapons &amp; areas of Black Mesa to explore, you also have the ability to lead and command small groups of fellow soldiers. The AI can get a bit spotty, but this game  is  more than 13 years old. If you liked Half-Life, you'll like this too.

It's fun as ♥♥♥♥ though.",

I will keep it short and sweet, there are new weapons as well as new monsters.   The game is slightly harder than the first Half-Life in terms of enemies being stronger, and puzzles being a bit harder. The wonderful thing is you get a selection of new weapons. You get a sniper rifle which is very useful against enemies at a distance. You also get an m249 saw so you can go Rambo on those headcrabs and roof barnicles, speaking of barnicles guess what? You actually get the barnicle as a weapon, you can use its unlogically long tongue to tarzan swing from catwalk to catlwalk or you can latch onto monsters and let the barnicle eat them. Kind of neat...and nast at the same time!!! ^_^   Overall this is another amazing classic that you should deffinitly pick up.",

You also have segments where you lead ai soldiers around so they can open doors for you and heal you. This is all to help you feel like you're part of the army descending on Black Mesa to find and kill Gordon. This spin off is shorter but it still tries to reflect the first game by having Sheperd go through a similar story arc. You work your way up starting with the head crabs and moving on to special forces and new variants on aliens. You also get access to more guns throughout the game but it feels a little tacked on at times. The story also messes with the whole timeline implying that aliens were being researched even before the resonance cascade. I'd say if you are a big enough fan of the series you should play it just because it's part of the HL universe.",

Now with the gameplay, the controls work preety well and very responsive, the level design is good but sometimes it lacks of health kit and the game saves as you enter in a new loading spot keeping your current health so that's mean if you enter a room with 10 health and suddelly 5 enemys appear in front of you (like most of the times does) you'll die and respawn with 10 health and the enemys will appear and kill you, that happend alot of times to me, but I managed to finish those parts [/spoiler] with some help of sv_cheats 1 [/spoiler]. The A.I of the HUMAN enemys is good, they hide in corners, run away from you, but the aliens/zombies just run into you no matter what. The music is good and pretty energising, but sometimes it stops for no known reason. It's a very old game so therefore I can't complain about the graphics. I only found 2 bugs in the game the first one is that you can reload the second pistol of the game even when it's full the second one is that I entered in a hole that I NEEDED to go through and I simply exploded... no really I exploded, when I tryed again it went perfectly well.

Adds some interesting alien weapons that are fun to use and even have an amount of utlity to them (barnacle gun lets you grapple yourself across organic environments, etc). This is set during the Black Mesa incident, only this time you take the perspective of one of the marines. Things start out slow, but soon enough you are introduced to new alien types and incredibly challenging scenarios where you will have to put your squad mates to use. If you want some more closure on the Black Mesa incident, this is a great game to play.",

            "review_text": "This is easily the better of the 2 HL1 Expansions.   Good points:  - introduces a few nice little mechanics like rope climbing/swinging and grappling. - night vision goggles instead of crumby flashlight. - some cool new enemies and weapons into the mix. - AI team-mates are used to great effect (better than in the main game or Blue Shift)  None of this is particularly world altering in itself but it's nice to have somethings that're new and different the stir up the HL1 formula a bit.  This game has some great moments; like being trapped on a platform that's gradually collapsing into toxic goo as everything crumbles around you or fighting in pitch-black tunnels against a nest of giant alien b*****ds, that really brought back to me that unique feeling of playing HL1 for the first time 15 years ago (I only played OpForce this weekend, so a very long gap).  Bad points:  - honestly the combat can be a little obtuse at times, large numbers of bullet spongey enemies and very few resources to help you out made a pretty aggrevating combo at several points in the game.  - a few points in the game felt like they were recycling situations from the main game a little too obviously (ie. Blast Pit style boss, control artillery strikes with command console puzzle) but that isn't to take away from all the good stuff that's here.  - final boss is a bit of a rinse-repeat, rinse-repeat style slog.   Overall though if you love HL1 and haven't played this, like I hadn't, then I'd definitely recommend it; it'll scratch your nostalgia itch really nicely while also being just a different enough spin on Half Life to feel fresh.",

            "review_text": "Half-Life: Opposing Force is a challenging and inventive expansion to Half-Life that provides players with interesting new weapons and gameplay mechanics. Players fill the boots of Cpl. Adrien Shephard, a marine stationed at a military base close to Black Mesa. After the events of Half-Life, Shephard's squad gets called to Black Mesa to help contain the alien threat. The game plays exactly like Half-Life, but Adrien gets access to a few weapons and abilities that Gordon did not. For example, Adrien can climb ropes and wires. He can also use his leadership abilities to have medics heal him or have an engineer weld a door open. Finally, Cpl. Shephard uses several new conventional weapons (laser dot magnum, LMG, sniper rifle) and unconventional weapons found throughout Black Mesa. Notable unconventional wepaons that get used in puzzles are the barnacle which lets you 'hookshot' certain points in the world and a kind of Portal Gun that transports you to Zen for its alt fire. All in all, I think this expansion is definitely worth a sale pickup if you enjoyed the original Half-Life and want more story.",

Like Half-Life, this game has some annoying aspects such as those freaking Sewers in Chapter 10. Aside from that, this was a fantastic expansion to the original game and pretty much the definition of Government Cover-Ups.  This game offers an interesting side story to the Black Mesa Incident and while you do fight Aliens, they are pretty different from the ones you fought in the original. Barely any Headcrabs, Alien Grunts, and Vortiguants. One thing I love about expansions is added content and that is what this game offers. New military grade weapons, new alien weapons, and one new weapon developed by the Lambda Core.  The soundtrack is fantastic and the level design is pretty good. As I said, this game has some annoying aspects (that freaking Sewer), but just like the original game, the good aspects pretty much made everything bad about the game forgivable.  Now what are you waiting for? Pick this game up!",

This expansion pack adds more weapons, such as a Sniper Rifle and a Machine Gun. The plot is not completely new, you play as a member of the forces, that Gordon Freeman fought with. It happens at the same time as in HL1, you can even see Gordon! From my experience, the game is even harder that HL1.  It took me around 5 hours to beat it.  I highly reccomend to buy it, but only when it is on a sale, or buy the whole franchise.",
