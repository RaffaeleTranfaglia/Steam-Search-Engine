            "review_text": "*NEW REVIEW 8-31-15* Changed to 'recommended' for anyone even slightly interested in tower defense games and cats. The best part is probably the dev's quick response to fixing the issues myself and other reviewers have had with the game, including bugs.  Since the dev has now fixed the bugs preventing me from progressing, I can now see more of the changes made since my original review (below). I have not earned my way to the different modes yet, so I'm just on the first one and my review only covers that. I'm playing in ez mode where Kingkat does not take your coins down to 500 as he did originally (and still does in the harder mode). In ez mode you get to keep whatever you earn and take as much as you want into battle. This may be OP and not challenging for many players, and those players can of course choose to play the harder mode. Since tower defense games aren't really my favorite (this is the only one I own in fact) it's a welcome casual feel for me and anyone looking for a casual but still fun experience would enjoy this, no doubt. Even with unlimited coins allowed in battle, you still can't expect to breeze through the game without earning upgrades and being tactical in your approach to defense.  Dev has also made the litterbox minigame much less annoying than it was originally. It's now much faster paced. Now too that I've been able to progress well it's not even necessary to play it since I can get a ton of coins from actual tower defense, but you do get free items from playing it and coins are always useful so it's never a pointless game, but can be avoided after a lot of progression if you desire. The Chow minigame could be avoided as well if you find yourself drowning in coins from simply chewing on dogs instead, but I find it interesting.  In case viewers opt not to read my original review below, the last part is still valid, so a repeat here: 'The music is also quite catchy and the style of the game is fitting for what it seems like it's trying to be, not really sure how to describe the style though without coming off as though I don't like it. I'm neutral on that stance if anything, it's in no way bad.'  The only issue I see now is that there doesn't appear to be a way to swap modes, so once you choose ez or hard you're stuck with it. Will suggest that among a couple other things in a post on the forums, otherwise I feel it's solid from what I've seen so far.  ----------- *ORIGINAL REVIEW* I suppose I should start with the disclaimer that I'm not usually a fan of tower defense games. This is in fact the only one I own. Unfortunately, this is much less a tower defense and more a litter box cleaning simulator. Yes, you can earn coins by other means, but here's the main problems with those means: 1. The 'chow' mini game (where you feed cats for coins and to be able to earn them for free use during battle) can only be played once and only if you progressed during your last run. I've not been able to play it after 3 runs now, I assume that's because each time I only managed to make it to wave 10 each time, never beating my highest score. 2. If you have more than 500 coins before entering battle, Kingkat takes all of your excess coins from you. He does NOT return them afterwards. If you're stuck like I am, this really sucks because that means you can't actually gain any coins simply by battling, you absolutely must play the litter box mini game and ONLY the litter box mini game to earn upgrades.  Now, this would be fine if the litterbox mini game was not tedious and irritating... but it is. Grab one poo, another appears, sometimes multiple. The small ones are worth 60, large worth 100, and it takes a bit of time to sift them, so it's not instant pick up. There's also the little waves of urine odor which can be dealt with with a spray that you earn through the litterbox mini game, but they also vanish over time if you just leave them. If you do manage to clear out the whole litter box you get a rain of money until something appears again. It's quite difficult to keep the box cleared though, so you sit there having to poke at it for quite a while before being able to upgrade anything.  If the dev reads this at all, I would ask you to consider either changing the way the litterbox minigame works (make it less tedious or make cleaning it more worth while) or add other means of making money, maybe more mini games or make battling more worthwhile (no more greedy Kingkats maybe). If any of that gets changed I will gladly revisit the game and consider changing my review to 'recommended' instead of not.  If you can get past the tediousness of the upgrades system, the tower defense part is pretty fun from what I've been able to see so far. The music is also quite catchy and the style of the game is fitting for what it seems like it's trying to be, not really sure how to describe the style though without coming off as though I don't like it. I'm neutral on that stance if anything, it's in no way bad.",
