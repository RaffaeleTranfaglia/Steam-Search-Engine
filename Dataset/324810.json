Complaining that features aren't in the FREE BASE GAME is dumb when it's literally marketed that way. You don't lose anything with the free model. You jump in, play and that's it. At least you can jump in and play a few matches and see if you like it enough to buy and unlock everything compared to just buying it and crying about it later. Some people just complain to complain after reading most of the reviews.  TL:DR, it's a free base model with 'limited' features unless you buy an unlock key essentially. Fun game for mindless shooting arena with friends or people online",

I bet that you have fond memories of those times - playing death-match with friends, total strangers or bots all day long. You started slow but eventually you improved and rocket jumped like a king. It was fun seeing how your skill went up while still getting stomped by the real pros from time to time.  Now fast forward to present day. You are now in mid 30s, working hard in full-time job and you don't really have time to play games anymore. But maybe you should... play a game which feels like something from 1999. A game where your body automatically remembers everything - how to aim with slow rocket launcher, how to predict and shoot grenade launcher, how to snipe those poor guys in the air or just how to run faster and jump further than normal.  Yes, you should play Toxikk - a game which brings pure old school Unreal Tournament-like experience (as opposed to Quake-like) just in new 'clothes'. It costs only 15E but there is also a free demo. I think that if you loved that kind of games in 1999, you will definitely like this one. I mean - you deserve this game.  Also tell your friends about it too :)",

I've had fun playing this game close to an hour, customizing the crosshairs and simply rekting bots as the servers were quite barren during the time I played it.    Even with ridiculous &gt;250 pings and with the Normal graphic settings, this game still feels completely playable and looks beautiful.   Will definitely recommend, or at least give this game a heads-up to people but due to the game's young age, high pings and lack of players, I will hold on to my wallet before purchasing this game but definitely keep in mind of it in the future.",

The game looks gorgeous, and runs incredibly well, it has great animations, an awesome soundtrack and a complete feature set of highly detailed maps, gamemodes, weapons, etc. that together create a package worthy of being deemed a full game. The gameplay is super fast and crisp, and with the release of the “Free Edition” the game quickly developed a sizeable player base, that at least in the meantime continues to grow. Overall, the community seems very helpful, sportsmanlike and respectful—just hop on Toxikk’s Discord server. Furthermore, the developers seem very dedicated, and continue to update their game and plan to add more features (such as a 1v1s gamemode, which in my opinion is essential for a competitive scene, and I’m disappointed it’s currently not present but that’s really my only major complaint at the moment) even after the release of version 1.0.  In short it’s an exceptional title, easily worth its full price. ",

            "review_text": "After trying this for a while I cannot recommend it to any FPS fans, as I find the design and execution to be rather disappointing.  1.The few levels are all very small and unoriginal, especially the one CTF map that was basically a big box with a couple vehicles and a pillar in the center.  2.The quickplay button tries to put you in full servers and ends up with an error message some times when you click it, requiring you to manually click it over and over again to get a match.  3. Weapons are rather lackluster, especially the melee weapon, which is just a pathetic re-imagining of Q3A's melee weapon.  4. Game defaults some pretty funky stuff, like the double-tap dodge mechanic, which you will repeatedly end up accidentally activating, until you finally find the way to turn it off is through a unintuitive slider in the key binding menu. Also, mouse acceleration is on be default. Who thought this was a good idea in a competitive FPS? (yeah I know some people actually use it, but I find them to be the exception in FPS games, not the norm)  5. Chat is hard to read and jumbled together with a bunch of useless information.  6. Bots on the servers are just terrible and only serve to feed kills to the other team.  7. Post-game screens are a jumbled mess that require you to uselessly left click to proceed through them, when all the relevant information could easily be presented in one easy-to-use panel.  I don't see anything that this game is doing that isn't already done better somewhere else. The controls are tight and easy to pick up (had a 13:1 kd/r within my first hour of playing), but that doesn't salvage it from the rest of the issues it currently has.",

The options are excellent but I would like to have a drop down console for commands. The maps are great although there arent many servers that have more than the core maps. I would like to see some official servers support more modes and maps. I get bored playing the same 4 maps all the time.  Weapon design is very good. It took me some getting used to, but they are all well balanced. The action gets very intense and I love how the games music changes based on where you stand during battle.  Overall if you love Unreal, Xonotic, and Quake you will love this game.",

Hopefully if any of my friends take my advice and try this game out and enjoy it I will not hesitate to purhcase the full game.  The only thing that i can imagine being an issue with this game is the playerbase. 400-500 online at peak times on a Saturday but thats no reflection of the quality of the game, I think like myself alot of people dont even know about Toxikk.

            "review_text": "Speaking from the heart, TOXIKK is an amazing multiplayer arena shooter. The controls are tight, the game is simple and hard to master, and it is frantic without being chaotic. The game lacks some maps, i think only 8 maps atm give or take, but the steamworkshop communitty has got that covered, and they have even brought some maps from Unreal Tournament over into TOXIKK too. Also, if you have ever played Unreal Tournament then you know what the game is like. In my opinion, it doesn't really matter if URT is better than TOXIKK and vice versa, TOXIKK is fresh while still maintaining that old classic 90's shooter feel. Not to mention that TOXIKK released in todays internet society, meaning it has alot of potential of becoming popular because of things like Youtube and the like. Also, the developers even offer a shareware (free) version of their game, meaning if all you wanna do is frag like no tomorrow without any preference then you can just download that instead. Now I must confess, I was not old enough to experience the hype and success of the games Doom and Quake (where deathmatch started, though TOXIKK has way more in common with URT), and I didnt really understand Unreal Tournament when I played it, I was too young and still in diapers. However, I DO get to experience a game like this, something that is similar but slightly different to those two games, something that I can call my own. This game has the potential to pull in fresh players like me and old vets from Quake and URT to play TOXIKK, and boy do I hope it does just that and its not me having wishfull thinking. This game makes me want to go up against masters of this type, to see what true skill is to see a player dominate the map with all weapons. So to anyone having doubts, try the shareware version before you buy! I did and I don't regret a thing.",

I thought it played pretty fun but in less than an hour I already found two major issues with the game that make multiplayer virtually unplayable. Issue one is that you seem to literally only have access to TWO maps. Just two. Issue number two is that there is NO SERVER BROWSE OPTION. Only quick join. This is a horrible issue combination as whenever you join a server playing a map that you don't have access to, the screen just stays black. You can't press anything so you have to alt+tab and then exit the game from the task bar. Yes, I know there needs to be restrictions to the free players vs. the ones who pay, but this particular set of restrictions is terrible. The two map selection restriction would be bareable if I could manually choose which server to join (perferrably a NAM server playing one of the two maps I can play) but most of the time I get auto-joined into a EU server that is apparently playing a map I can't. Say hello to the black screen again.  Ofc buying the full version would probably fix these issues but I'd like to play a bit more of the game before I make the final decision. Unfortunately, they made playing the game pretty difficult...  Please don't treat this as a glorified demo, because it really is only a demo. If you don't change the current state of things, you will continue to get a lot more angry/negative reviews despite how good the actual full-pay-to-access version of the game is",

Obviously I know it's a suit feature as of the first time I booted it up and the first game I entered it was already hotkeyed to my mouse if I actually ever was to use it. But then again as I said cowards use such a feature. I've cloaked about 11 times? For the 2.7 hours I've put in so far?     Also I'm glad to see this little well made gem of a con written by someone else. (Pretty bad to see up to at least 9 cons.....)  '9. Maps are made for controlling a particular area, usually that has a rocket launcher. Area's give alot of advantage versus any other player (RL, super armor, megahealth can be found in close proximities on some maps, to rocket launcher, which also leads to high, advatage areas on the map that usually have 1 or 2 entrances).'       Last time I checked old school shooters had power ups availible for pickup, not built in your suit for free use. Old school shooter games are supposed to be about twitching faster and killing that guy the split sceond he hops around the corner, not just tapping your cloak and camping for your UAV. Oh! or just being a rocket launcher piece of trash that can't aim.  Which kills a lot of the fun in this game you pass by a guy cloaked in a corner with a rocket launcher (Yes, people are still visible but they're more so while moving.) Now I just have to await the royal b|tchatry by the game's fanboys. Every game has them.  Oh well I can't be too harsh they haven't gotten my money. I doubt they will until they change some sh|t.",

It is a whole lot of platforming and not in the good way. The double jump needs to be pressed short time span, the dash jump is complete ♥♥♥, and the final part i got to the game just gavee up on me and pretty much said to figure it out myself. Cool i love how games especially on the first level leave me to figure out some type of strategy on my own, thanks.  Platforming sucks, alot of times you will need to do some pixel perfect jumps. I am looking at you dash jump part. If it isnt that then maybe you might need to jump on narrow platforms because reason.  Did they even try with the save points? I got to the last part of the first mission and fell. That wouldnt be a problem if it didnt land on the save station. Guess where i started after i decided to kill myself at the new save spot. I wouldnt think it would be hard to disable a save spot once you activate one futher preventing me from saving myself backwards in the level.  Combat? Whats that? Seriously if the first level has combat but it is more like a shooting gallery then why give me guns? I was able to kill all the enemies in the first mission without much effort.  You can pay or get it for free from what i see from the store. Thats kinda weird seeing that for the game. If i have to say anything get it for free if you want to try it out rather than pay for it. Would paying for the game give you bonus materials or something because if you have 2 options to choose from i can safely say people with get the free one instead of paying unless they want to support the developer.  Conclusion: It is a poorly made game. Very focused on platforming which isnt a bad thing if the platforming was good and some jumps are not leaps of faiths on whether you can make it or not because the dash jump sucks. For those interested in the game go ahead and try it out, it is free but for those expecting much from it. I can say it does not deliever on a good experience. I played for a short time and gave up after i saved myself backwards in the stage meaning i had to do what i have already went through to get back.",

Red Cell is BULLSH** but also kinda fun. its both the worst tutorial ive ever had the pleasure of playing in any FPS game and also a great hoot...kind of. the contracts were way to easy. i mean come on the bots on other games like this were dumb as hell no difference here. it does make for some good dumb fun though. 3.) sure this is a 'succesor' to games like UT, Doom, Quake etc etc. but those games are better. this game borrows WAY to much from them. 4.) combat: boils down to who has the rocket launcher/shotgun/ or that lucky turd who found the super weapn...the hellraiser is that it. oh and about that: REDEEMER MUCH! 1 shot dumb fire rocket primary fire, 1 shot guide it with your mouse alt fire. redeemer style. who else remembers that from unreal? 5.) other personal reasons i wont go into.  now with my opinion being said. its not nessecarily bad but its not good either. its ok. run of the mill. since this was written when the game was free. sure give it a try if you want. but dont expect anything amazing.",

The playerbase was pretty strong and I convinced my friends to shell out the money to buy it. Then the player base started to dwindle and the Devs said they were waiting on marketing it until everything was finished. Then, when it was finished, they made it free... so the the three of us really just burned our money on a game we hardly were able to play and then became free. I had said it was an investment and it was - a poor one.    The game is Early Access and the Devs are doing things right.   With that being said, do I think they should not have published to STEAM yet and just sent out Alpha or Beta downloads? Yes. I'm afraid the negative reviews due only to lack of players will offset the recommendation for when the game is released. And this is a great game. The servers used to be packed.   Are the servers empty? Yes. However, the devs are constantly active on the forum and don't want to market the game until they feel it's ready. This isn't other Early Access titles where the devs release a crappy game and vanish with your money. This game is ready to play but has limited maps. The devs are active and answer questions not only daily but HOURLY. During the last release it was a matter of minutes and seconds.  Really, in its current state, the game is an investment. Buy now at the $19USD and play it when it is finished and there is a higher playerbase. Or wait and pay what may be $50, because that's what the game is worth - that's what any other publisher would charge for this game in its completion. Don't expect to purchase the game now and begin fraggin immediately. I know that sucks, I really do, but it is what it is.  It's up to you.",

The 'Free Edition' is a free demo and should not be confused with free-to-play. It's not called demo because on Steam demos mean you can't play with owners of full game. In TOXIKK you can.  What you get with the full edition are more official maps (the better ones actually), access to community servers with can run community made maps, game types and other modifications. The steam workshop is already full with community content.  TL;DR:  Don't listen to the haters. Wait a day till the initial matchmaking issues are fixed, then try it out yourself. During Early Access 85% of reviews were positive, and probably 10% complained about issues that are to be expected in Early Access.

I haven't touched the vehicles yet. I see a lot of people complain about them, but in the free version, the maps with vehicles are so small that they are pointless. The game shines in its deathmatch and capture the flag modes, but there is a domination-like mode that I don't care much for. In most games, you have to hold the point. In this, you just have to touch it to capture it. I didn't care much for other games' domination modes in the first place, though. There is a stealth system, similar to active camo in halo, but it only lasts for about a second, so you really need to learn how to move before you can use it effectively. It adds to the gameplay's frenetic nature, as you fly around and suddenly are being ambushed from an angle you weren't expecting. This game boasts 'frag like its 1999,' and it definitely delivers. The guns feel appropriately balanced and movement is free enough to allow for crazy gun battles games like the Doom remake or Call of Duty simply can't deliver. Doom and Call of Duty also can't run on potatoes. So go ahead, break out that old laptop from 2009, and download this game, if you really want to, just because you can.",
