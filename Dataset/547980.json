            "review_text": "An excellent roguelike that is deceptively deep. Don't let the cute graphics fool you, this game requires patience, knowledge, and good decision making skills. I have a few dozen runs so far in this game and feel all 3 classes (Warrior, Thief, and Wizard) are distinct, balanced, and fun. And make no mistake, while this game has a unique take on roguelike mechanics, it's very much a true roguelike; it's turn based, has intense resource management, and every run is totally different.  For example, I just lost a good run as a Warrior because I fished too much. Yes, seriously. You can fish if you have the fishing pole item, which is a great and extremely reliable source of, well, fish, which heal you and replenish your stamina (which you need to do virtually everything aside from moving,) but I carelessly fished over, and over, and over, until my stamina was very low.... when suddenly I fished up a ♥♥♥♥ing dragon. Well, I probably could've handled it, if it weren't for the fact that I had a whopping 8 stamina going into the fight (this is a very low number for a fight against a tougher enemy.)  Moments like these are very special and are what make roguelikes so fun. This game is chock full of them. And look at the price! It's a steal at $3.",
