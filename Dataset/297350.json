            "review_text": "This is THE game I have been hoping to come across one day. Finally a story-driven game with an engaging (and beautiful) atmosphere that does not see the need to keep me preoccupied with puzzles or inherently useless gameplay mechanics. The game takes you on a walk through a world where fantasy dances around with reality in delicate coordination. Oh, it was SO refreshing!  The Old City: Leviathan   is full to the brim with satisfying contemplative fodder for the daydreaming or philosophical mind. I played through it once but it will require several playthroughs to get a decent grasp of everything it wants to say. I am going to add my opinion here of what the game was trying to say. I don't want to ruin anything for anyone so I will put a spoiler tag on it just in case.    For me the game has mirrored my journey of seeking the absolute truth, my endeavor to find peace of mind and certainty, but in the end finding none of that. I have begged religion and science for the answers to life's mysteries as have the people spoken of in this story. Unfortunately, the closer you get to a more 'objective' truth the more questions you end up with than answers. If any of that journey sounds familiar to you this game may make a lot more sense to you. Oh, boy here I go..... philosophical tangent..... Like I said this game is a mirror, maybe there is no objective truth...... can any of us see reality with complete objectivity? Don't we all look at life through some version of rose colored glasses, through some inherent bias? Maybe that is what the game is trying to say.... tangent finished    Anyway, I love this game. I wish there were more just like it. I wish every 'walking simulator' were just as engaging in story and in atmosphere. I wish other ones would take out their silly puzzles and just let me explore their ideas and the environment. Thank you developers for this incredible game.",

            "review_text": "'The Old City: Leviathan' is a existencial, philosophical piece. It's far from a game, but more of a First Person Experience.  This short, but brilliant work of art tells several stories, which are open to interpretation. All of these stories are filled with direct and indirect symbolism. It speaks about the human condition, about choices and about progress. And it does so in very beautiful, expressive writing and amazing visual acompaniment. Even though the symbols used are quite original in thought, they suffer the same problem all western-born symbolism shares - there is too much religious undertone that holds the entire structure. However, here it's at least done properly. The symbols expand from one to several meanings and ultimately - grant truth in thought.  Very few gripes can be had here otherwise. Overmapped surfaces sometimes cause you to bump into rocks or edges, slowing you down. And it's a bit tiresome to stop and read all the text scattered across the landscape. All pages that can be found are well written and interesting, revealing quite a lot about the miracle world you walk in, but stoping to read causes the player to stop exploring, which is the biggest drive in intriguing place like the Old City. It's sad that they were not voiced, so the player could listen to them while exploring (simillar to Voxophones in BioShock, etc). Beyond that, 'The Old City: Leviathan' is the most thought-provoking and meaningful 'gaming' experience I've ever had. It's the closest thing to art I've felt since 'Journey' and it's a shame it's so underground. This also speaks a lot about our society, for if this had been a book or a short story, even a movie, it would have gotten huge praise. But that's a talk for another time. Those who crave something meaningful and beautiful, which will leave them sinking in thought - Leviathan calls for you, so fall and be brave. To everyone else, who thinks that philosophical artpieces are not their thing - you are probably right, but still keep in mind that the game is very beautiful - there is loads to see in this world. And even if you deny the symbolism, the pure story told is very intriguing, as the world built seems surprisingly believable.  'The Old City: Leviathan' is one of the best experiences available in the market. If you think you are going to enjoy this, you mos tcertainly are (for one reason or another). Spread the word, get more people to feel this, as it is a masterpiece worthy of something much more than a GOTY.",

            "review_text": "You spend most of your time exploring abandoned sewers and subway stations, wandering around aimlessly until you find the one door in the area that loads the next chapter. Your exploration is results in minor rewards with a small number of collectibles and some notes left behind by previous inhabitants of the abandoned passageways. The environments are extremely detailed but, sadly, the gorgeous environments are about all this game has going for it.  The game is advertised as having significant depth and meaning, but ultimately the story is a convoluted mess that just leaves you confused when the game suddenly and unexpectedly ends. The game gives just enough story elements for you to know that  something  is going on, but not enough information for you to actually know  what  is happening (or happened). There's something about a catastrophic event, contaminated water supply, three factions of idealist, and some parasite...? I never really understood. Story elements are presented piecemeal through fragmented dialogue and scarcely placed text, which results in the vast majority of the story content being missable if you don't discover all the hidden writings. I consider this an unforgivable failure in a walking simulator considering the story  is  the game.  Other quibbles: The default movement speed is unbearably slow and the run speed provides an almost imperceptible increase, so still unbearably slow. I held the run button the entire game and felt like I was crawling. There are also a few audio glitches in the game that cause multiple audio tracks to play simultaneously, resulting in the narrator talking over himself.",

            "review_text": "First, you should note that The Old City: Leviathan is not a game for everyone and it is not meant to be.  The Old City is a story, where you are the main character exploring and experiencing the story first-hand. If you are not into reading long notes, empathizing with your character and excogitate about his and the whole situation, then maybe this game is not the right choice for you.  Nonetheless let us talk about the game in detail.  Yes, it is short. It only took me close to six hours to complete the story, despite reading everything thoroughly and taking my time to explore each and every corner of the game. Yet, it still was an interesting, philosphical but sometimes even horrid experience.  Keep a close eye(and ear) one the story and narratives and you will get to know who you are and why you see things like you do. Visiting a place twice might also be worth it. All in all notes and narratives are very well written and provide enough information to grasp the plot.  Visuals and the soundtrack provide a great atmosphere which changes troughout the game, from horrific scenes to beautiful industrial scenery. The graphic style is very similar to Dishonored and powered by the Unreal Engine on DirectX 9, which is in no way a bad thing.  All music is composed and recorded by Cryo Chamber. You can buy the soundtrack here:   Cryo Chamber - The Old City: Leviathan OST  [cryochamber.bandcamp.com] .  This review may not be very long, but i don't want to spoil any of the story and there really is not much to say about gameplay as there is nothing but to walk around and move the mouse. So i will conclude this here.  The Old City: Leviathan is a philosophical story in which you are ought to explore, think and find out.  It is designed to make you think and that it does.",

            "review_text": "First of all, I should be clear that this is NOT a game for everyone. If you like action packed games or clear, strutctured linear stories (because those are fun too, right?), then you might want to think about buying this game.  If you have a pretty open mind, like narrative driven stories that make you really think and you enjoy immersing yourself in an environment, then this is a great game for you! The Old City: Leviathan is a narrative-driven game which some have deemed a 'walking simulator' which I feel is rather unfair. It's a unique game, to be sure.  The Old City Leviathan is, first off, a beautifully crafted game. Very few games, even AAA titles today, can really pull off the amazing sense of atomsphere and environment. As you, the player, walk around this world of the Old City, it carries a strange air of eerie beauty. Even the sewers you find yourself in have a charm to them, having been turned into tempoary abodes by the sparse population. Perhaps its beauty lies in the sense of decay and the lonliness of the character as he explores an empty shell. Now and then, you alternate from 'reality' to dream although it's difficult to tell sometimes. You may find, as I have, that re-visiting areas yield changes, some marginal, some noticeable.  There are no puzzles, no traps and no enemies in this world and this is very deliberate. Your role is not to fight, but to explore, to immerse yourself in this strange and exotic world.  The in-game story is a little vague at times, partly due to the mode of storytelling which is told through monologues and pages. As you explore and read the notes left for you, things become a little clearer. The monologues and many of the notes are generally philsophical in many ways although you do receive some backstory into the main characters.  The theories esposued are not altogether clear or easy to understand, but as I mentioned above (and as the developer explainned) this isn't a game for everyone. The theories are interesting though and as you learn more, you might form your own theories. The main one, or rather, the one I latched onto, was seeing the game in a biblical sense but there are probably many theories in this game.  This is a game that is very different from many other games. I might go so far as to call it a 'therapy game' because I found exploring the Old City and the dream worlds quite relaxing. It is a beautiful, detailed and thought-provoking story-driven game and I hope big game developers are taking notes on this. I am certainly looking forward to more from this developer. Keep up the good work.",

The Meh  As I stated above, the monologue is, at best, the ramblings of a middle school student trying to get a C+ on an essay for English class. If the devs had chosen to only tell the story through written and/or visual clues, that would have been so much better.  Verdict: Nay  If you can get this one for dirt cheap, or free, yeah, it’s probably worth a playthrough. Honestly, though, your money would be better spent by just buying the OST.",

First: I played it on Windows XP, and it ran fine - so if you're still an XP gamer, give it a go.  Secondly: Be aware that there's some pretty heavy (dense) philosophy that at first was off-putting to me, especially the amount of reading that wasn't making sense to me. It seemed so over the top - but as the game progressed that became less of an issue for me and I started gathering better what was going on with the story. The world is what is left from a literal war between ideologies/philosophies - and the narrative is one man's story of trying to make sense of it all.  The visuals, world building, and attention to detail are truly 'stunning'. There is so much care put into designing the world. So many little details. I took alot of photos (f12) while playing. There's not much you can interact with, but if you like exploring, this feels like a place that was lived in.  Understand that this is very much a world that you travel through - not a world that you interact with in any meaningful way beyond opening doors. At first I was frustrated by this, but once I understood how the game worked, I was OK with it. It's not like Gone Home or similar where you pick up items to learn about the story. In The Old City you are an observer - a passer through. The story is told by what you see, short snippets of spoken narrative, and by the notes you find on the wall.  Anyhow, in total I feel like this game had a considerable amount of heart and care put into it - and despite any shortcomings is well worth a playthrough if you like walking simulator type games.",

            "review_text": "My initial impression of this game was poor. The narration seemed like arrogant, pretentious rambling and the game immediately places you within a room that features six story notes to read. I swiftly tuned the narration out and after a few rooms stopped reading the notes. Finishing the game at about 2 hours, I was left fairly underwhelmed bar the very impressive graphics and occasional fantasy-like vistas.  However, there must have been *something* there as for whatever reason I replayed the game immediately – this time reading the notes and listening to the narration (albeit with his volume reduced). I enjoyed it considerably more. One of the factors for this is that in the first few chapters of my first play through I had completely disregarded that some of the doors were labelled 'Exit'. This led to me actually missing entire scenes/events, with particular note to the first chapter where it arguably matters most when trying to engage a player. If I don't want to admit to being stupid, I chalk this up to modern gameplay and quite simply not having to care or pay attention to environmental details such as this in most games. Either way, I find it very odd that the developer intentionally gives you the ability to skip game sections in this manner. I don't understand how this makes sense in a linear game.  Additional Notes: It's probably a technical consideration but the fade to black between certain doors and chapters sometimes hindered immersion. It would be fantastic if the levels could be streamed together, giving a better illusion of a complete world – or even an unexpected, disjointed entry into fantasy. When ending a level with a fall, the player can often be heard audibly landing. It's the players own fault but during chapter introductions you can jump, making it sound a little silly. Performance is pretty much rock solid bar chapter 11, which halved my framerate. Movement input is digital hence annoying with a gamepad – especially those with sticks that don't always sit neutral! The run speed is quite pedestrian, bordering on tedious.",

The game will take hold of them where they are and lift them into a new world, guiding them and teaching them. The Old City fails to do that. Instead it alienates the player with wilfully obtuse language and bores them with a complete disregard for pacing.   Creating a game that is entirely exploration with a single narrator is challenging indeed. Although we have seen how effective it can be when done right, such as in Portal and The Stanley Parable, the difference between those games and this highlights the need to speak TO your audience, not AT them. Flat monologues with sentences such as 'An assertion from an assumption is still an assertion, making any deduction from that foundation subject to critique.' and 'Epistemic humility can regress to the deconstruction of stagnation.' distract the player from the immersion of the game, and break the illusion that the person speaking is the character they are controlling. It is hard to get into a first-person character when they are practically speaking a language you do not understand.   Games such as Doom 3, Bioshock, and The Last of Us (particularly the starting acts of each of these games) show us how well a world can be portrayed through notes, events, and other environmental clues around you. In fact the opening segments of each of those games works without any of the main game action. Coming back to The Stanley Parable again we can see how well pacing can be managed with the narrator filling in the gaps of otherwise mindless travel. Imagine, if you will, a long corridor or expanse that stretches before you. You know that you must walk to the far edge of that space. In The Old City this is mostly done in silence which, while it gives you a moment to appreciate the obvious beauty of the landscape, soon falls into dull trudgery. Not helped by the many times when you must travel back to point X to explore the other fork in the pathway as the one you have been following has lead to a dead end.  On a technical note, the lack of advanced video controls make this game hard to tweak to run on lower end systems. You can turn motion blur off, change the resolution, and that is about all. As a result it ran very clippy on my steam-powered crank-started laptop (no one's fault but my own I know).  All in all a dissapointment. There was so much potential here for an incredible experience, however the flaws above coupled with the lack of richness in the environment (particularly a complete lack of anything to interact with in any form) mean that I would not recommend it to anyone.",

Admittedly, it is short: I finished it in under 3 hours, although I didn't find everything and didn't manage to piece the whole story together. But, overall, if you want an immersive, positively stunning experience, get this game.",

This game will not suit the person who abhors the idea of reading large books on their own accord. (An actual novella is within the game). This game will not suit the person who doesn't like to be uncomfortable (Major themes of loneliness, depression, mental illness, anxiety, and death are at play). This game will not suit the person who does not like to take their time and truly savor each area (Without exploration, the game becomes fragmented and confusing). This game will definately not the suit the person who is afraid to dislike a protagonist ( Our protagonist is to be questioned, analyzed, and dissected by the player.)   In summary, if you are the person who enjoys investigation and analysis of major works, then this is probably for you. To fully understand will take many hours, but the catharsis is the same as at the end of reading a large novel. The only critic I truly have is that it took awhile for me to configure the settings correctly but in the end it was worth the hassle for the amazing story, landscape, and wonder the game created.",

Things settle down a bit come chapter 6/7, or at least I started to understand what was going on. Make sure to read all the notes and books, it fills in the story quite a bit. You may notice GUO factions matching real world events today, I thoroughly enjoyed that aspect of the story.",

I'd be curious about what inspired it. I sensed twinges of Dear Esther, Moby ♥♥♥♥, The Bible, Dishonored, Bioshock, and really, the list keeps going. Surprisingly diverse game, considering the play time.  8/10, for what it is. Definitely won't be for everyone, but if you've liked other games like this (focus on atmosphere and narrative), it's worth a shot. I don't suspect you'll be disappointed.",

Something profound about metaphysics, I think.  Despite this, it's well worth a play if you liked Dear Esther, which it greatly resembles. It's a 'walking simulator' through and through, so you have to like the genre (and I do).  At their best, the environments in this game are breathtaking - really inventive. Other parts look like a sewer level from Half-Life.  Games of this sort often use the 'found book' method for exposition, and The Old City turns this up to 11. There are screens and screens of stuff - most of which I skimmed. Luckily, none of this is required for finishing the game (phew). If you read all the books in Skyrim you'll be like a pig in ____ here :)   ",

In greater depth, let's get this out of the way first--yes, this game is *gorgeous.* Not just in terms of its commendable graphical prowess, but in terms of its visual presentation. Its labyrinthine levels are sumptuously designed and evocative, somewhere between City 17 and Giorgio de Chirico.   The writing isn't as bad as some of the other reviews have made it sound--the game definitely feels pretentious, and it has some pacing issues, but if you can look past that, there's an interesting (if heavy-handed) meditation on futility and truth to be found here--very Kafka-Lite. The best bits are definitely the ancillary notes and text posted around the game's environment, which represent the views of people who've lived in the game's mysterious environment and struggled with the miserable emptiness of it.   Unfortunately, the narrator you're saddled with spends most of the game as the sort of nihilistic, dull teenager who just discovered Nietzsche and wants to sound important. It's not a dealbreaker--like all good fictional characters, he undergoes a change as the story goes along--but it definitely drags down what feels like a thoughtful experience into something that feels pedantic and not half as smart as it thinks it is.  All told, though, if you like walking simulators, thought-provoking narratives and environmental storytelling, it's easy to look past the narration and enjoy The Old City.",
