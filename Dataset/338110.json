            "review_text": "It's an interesting game with a set of unusual puzzles - using mirror and prism obelisks to bend light rays around to trigger runes so you can go through a pyramid.   The story portion of the game is ... odd. I appreciate that the writers gave the main character a backstory, but the information comes up in jagged bits as he enters each new chamber. 'Hey, I figured out the chamber. If only my wife hadn't left me and taken the kids with her.' After a few chambers, you uncover a god who likes to dole out bits of the pharoah's story in an omnious voice. The sequence is: wander in to a room, get a random thought from the 'hero', solve the scarab part of the chamber, get a foreboding sentence or two from the god, then solve the rest of the chamber. Lather, rinse, repeat. The two sets of dialog don't mesh that well together, so it comes across as a mash-up of 2 incredible disparate Twitter feeds.  Overall I liked the puzzle play, but there are a few glaring problems.  1) You can't zoom out all the way to see the entire puzzle chamber. After the first few rooms, you have to pan around to see all the parts of the chamber. Not only is this annoying and unnecessary for game play, but it's very easy to accidentally reposition an obelisk instead of moving the camera. With some of the obelisks requiring very precise positioning, having them get bumped around is monitor-punching frustration.  2) The game mechanics aren't well explained. Most of it is pretty intuitive. The scarabs, though, are not. I thought the scarabs had to be destroyed when lining up the light ray to the exit. They don't. They do need to be destroyed by the blue light, all three at once, but the light ray doesn't need to be accomplishing any thing else during that time. I wasted a stupid amount of time trying to nuke them while opening the exit from the chamber.   Despite the flaws, it's a fun game that most people should find challenging with a story that is unintentionally amusing.",
