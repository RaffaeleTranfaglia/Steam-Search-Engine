You can technically spend as long as you like with single player, building up safehouses, resources, and survivors to fight the infected onslaught. Otherwise, you can just burn through this game in a few hours -- you only need to kill the 'brain bug' type of monster to win, so you can leave plenty of areas uncleared before completing the game.  If you want a moderately challenging single-player campaign, pick this up when it is on sale. $5 or less is my recommendation.",

The playtime isn't bad for such a low budget game, However, I just ran into a bug that completely blocked game progression - due to a 'defend' mission not ending - nor allowing me to withdraw.  Elevator pitch: Top down scavage &amp; survive in a Left 4 Dead style zombie world...  Review: This game could have been epic, but the bugs, near programmer level art, flat and unexiting skillsystem make for a very flat and unengaging experience in the end... It is a shame, because a few bits taken care of - this could easily have been worth €20+. Such as: - A massive bug-hunt... - An art overhaul... - More skills both in number and variation... - Some added gameplay features like sneak, move&amp;fire, etc.  ...as it stands - I guess I'm ok with donating €6 to the dev for a good try. Perhaps if he gets enough such donations he will wrap this up into the game it deserves to be.   Recommend? This is a hard call... really hard. While I really DO want to recommend this rough diamond - the developer has all but carried himself to the finishing-line and needs but fall over to complete the product - unfortunately I can not recommend a game which has a progression blocks.  If I see regular updates - I will reconsider this assessment.",

Pros: * Can be run with even a potato * Been in multiple bundles, so value is cheap * Good concept * Scavenging * Mechanics like the horde, which make you hide indoors * Still manages to create a believeable atmosphere * A lot of gameplay hidden here  Neutral: * Stealth, but extremely whimsily made * Graphics look like they were made with paint sometimes * Randomized world, but no personality to it  Cons: * Survivors have no personality with no real reason to care about their survivor, except for their experience points and levels * Repetitive * Bad controls * Unclear campaign objectives other than 'There is scientist, he know cure, we go get!' * The enemy types are indestinguishable sometimes  Overall:  6/10 Buy it only during a sale, from a bundle or trade for it.",

It is very important to place your soldiers tactically. Rushing in a building with all 4 soldiers might get you swamped with Zombies. So scout the place first, stealth kill stray Zeds, thin the Zeds by shooting through windows and so on. But always have someone cover the back as Zombies can sneak up from behind. Use your gadgets wisely! There are some elements that force you making quick decisions like bombs, alarm traps and Zombie spawning room size hearts :D",

I too, looking at the videos and pics of gameplay thought this game looked pretty good. Of course, any product may look good in theory and before the initial tryout, but this game is seriously not worth the biggest sale price they could give you. Maybe free, it would be relevent, but this game is incomplete, and seriously a dissappointment. Its kinda like when 2K announced they were remaking the famous XCOM game, but then they also announced that they were making it a shooter. Although they did make the new XCOM and did a really good job. Sadly, this product isnt even halfway close to the aforementioned situation. The devs sold this game for 8.99, which is not that bad of a price for a good game, but this game is just bad. Its incomplete, buggy, and if youve been listening to what the devs say, they think that the game being incomplete actually makes it complete. Thats sad. So please, STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME. EVEN IF ITS ON SALE, DO NOT GIVE THESE DEVS A SINGLE PENNY.",

You advance through checkpoints on a map, capturing and securing resource nodes in an attempt to exterminate zombies from the face of the earth. You can scavenge new materials, weapons and blueprints from buildings.  Many of the buildings repeat very often. A greater variety of layouts would have been really nice, I have only seen four or five constructs so far.  Special zombies are extremely dangerous, and can temporarily disable one of your squad, making it necessary to travel in groups of two or more.  Weapons and armors seem a little expensive, but it doesn't kill the sense of advancement.  Overall, I definitely reccommend this game. A good buy for tactical gameplay fanatics. ",

            "review_text": "Its well worth 10euros! - quite a few items, resonably fair gameplay, tho a few spikes occur due to the sami randomnature of this game. Theres crafting, different weapons, and RPG-lite levveling system, semi randomized maps and campaigns, 4 game modes, hundreds of corpses onscreen, ah yes the sentry gun, and funky little details all over like lightning flashes, and footsteps.  The campaign allows you to 'take over' maps which can then be harvested for resources, and theres even missions to defend them. It works Nodule style, the zombie busting team working their way quick-travel by car, to each set of building complexes, then they try to clear them of zombies, zombie spawns, aswell as trying to free more survivors. Things can get super hectic at times, due to booby traps and other unforseen events, and special zombies appear- dissapointingly ripped straight from Left4Dead. Imagination. Hire me or something. Thats a minor gripe tho. Another is boobytraps that can be avoided mostly, but theres a roguelike factor in where the wireclippers are located, when the doors are auto locked. Could be next to the bomb. Could be in like 16 other drawers, cabinet etc. in the house, which can be a little steep if only a lone survivor made it in before the doors get locked. Its fairly minor again, i think ill break most hard maps with a bit of patience, or the computer will re-generate the map with randomized traps/alarms on next reload. I wouldnt say the game looks fantastic graphically, but theres a certain charm to everything. UI is fairly good allround, nothing too bothersome, except the level up indicator is hard to see, but thats fairly minor. All in all, 3 hours just went after i first booted it up, and im picky as hell! a good atmosphere gets going, and the pannicy bits, even if they result in death, are quite entertaining. - Looking forward tot he semi sequel Gauntlets! 8.5/10 instabuy on sale!",
