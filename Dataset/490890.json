            "review_text": "A wonderful Yuri Visual Novel! *double thumbs up!* the feels.... at that ending...  the romance build up is fantastic the plot and story is always intense and constantly changing topics there is slight humour aswell so it isnt always depressing and finally that plot ending.. i really cant wait to play the second part of this game and i hope it will be just as long as this one!   Whats the story about? Well.. you get to play the story from 2 main characters from the game  The first character is Len (main protag) which you play through majority of the story.   The second character is Shinonome (main character - friend of Len's) which you play during towards the end of the game  You basically see/read the story from both character perspectives throughout the game which does explain some more details about the plot and story. A basic plot You as Len are a city girl who gets 'roped' into a secret organization thats supposedly fighting evil demons that are trying to revive their master from being banished from 100 years ago. She gets trained and taught how to fight using a special divine sword against the Oni, however not everything is good as it seems there are dark events throughout the game and you have to read it in order to find out what happens next.   Rating: Gameplay: There are no choice options this is a visual story after all.  It took me roughly 4 - 5 hours to finish the game but the game is only up to 1 GB. I suggest to slowly pace yourself through the game and read the dialogue thoroughly to understand the story and enjoy it better rather than fast pacing yourself through it.  Story: 10/10 Although i have to confess i did predict or see some plot points but the game was still entertaining Character development: 10/10 Yes character development was great!  Relationship development: 10/10 it slowly builds up which i prefer in visual novels Humour: 8/10 some of the jokes felt stupid but hey i still enjoyed it Cliff hangers? yes! be prepared for them!   So part 2 is releasing in winter 2016 (hopfully)  which im assuming by towards the end of december 2016? Anyway i just hope part 2 is just as long as part 1 was because it only took me 4 - 5 hours to finish this game and i was pacing myself through the game too.   Is the game worth buying?  seeing how its only 9 - 10 USD dollars i think its worth it to support not just the developers of the game but Sekai Project too :D Also i loved seeing those 2 girls from that other yuri visual novel 'sacrement sheep' during the begining of the game it was hilarious and cute :)   Im not great at typing up reviews,  i just hope my input has given you enough information about the game and if you think its worth playing.  Thanks for reading my review :P",

            "review_text": "I really cannot recomend this game. I have played only about 2 hours of this but i just cant take any more.   The protagonist girl is suddenly taken away from her normal life and told she have been chosen since birth to become part of some anti-demon fighting force ... and her parents are totaly fine with it. Leaving her shool and friends behind to go fight demons ... its totaly ok, carry on.  Then they dump magical sword on her and tell her she is the only hope!  I mean can the begining even be more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥? I was pulling my hairs out reading this. Art is mediocore at best, some of backgrounds looks like slightly modified photos.  Maybe this VN got some awesome story later in game, but i will never find out, because i just cant take anymore of this.  I was Indiegogo backer for Ne no Kami, but it seems i have chosen poorly.",
