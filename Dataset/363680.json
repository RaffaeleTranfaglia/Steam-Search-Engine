            "review_text": "I will review this game from three different angles.   -As a WH40k fan. -As a fleet action strategy game.  -As a multiplayer game.   - As a fan of the universe I must say outright that this title does WH40k very well. It is true to the universe, setting just the right atmosphere of gothic warfare between the most well-known of the universes races. It gives a good portrayal of the 12th Black Crusade, also known as the Gothic War, from the perspective of the Imperial Navy. It gives us reasonably believable characters, acceptable dialogue and excellent cinematics. Those who worked in the art department and the writers of the storyline has earned their keep. There are a few things, here and there, which could have been written or done differently, but these are minor issues.  - The game as a fleet action strategy game is true to the tabletop mechanic in the sense that it is 2D, not 3D. This might be an issue for some, but I understand why they went this direction. There are already a lot of management, and potentially a lot of micro-management, without adding a third layer. Also, most of the ships of the WH40k universe have always been portrayed as broadside vessels, It makes sense. As for micro-management, that can become an issue, especially if you have a large fleet and wish to do everything yourself. Luckily most abilities can be set to trigger automatically, and the AI does so in a mostly effective manner. The game is a solid, if not excellent strategy title. Single-player also has skirmish and custum game modes; now with co-op.  - As a multiplayer game, however, the game has flaws, flaws that are not quite as apparent in single player and co-op games. Despite multiple patches the game has balance issues, some purely to do with the strength or firepower of certain ships and factions, others to do with map mechanics versus mobility, or certain faction's lack of mobility. Eldar are highly agile and fast and have a distinct advantage when it comes to maps where mobility is key. Arguably some of their ships still have too potent firepower, though equally arguably, their ships are too fragile. On the other end are Orks, who's ships are very tough, good short range firepower, but overall are slow, lacks agility and as such, seem to suffer in many cases, and are sluggish compared to not only Eldar, but also Chaos. Even the Empire can outmanouver them. These balance issues can make multiplayer frustrating.  Note: There are those that reports bugs, and crashes. I have however only encountered a few bugs and in my almost 200 hours (199,3 at time of writing) playing this game, never had a crash.   In conclusion; this game is good, but it could have been better. It is of course very easy to come with critque. The designers have done a job which must be described as solid. Are there a few bugs that needs ironing out? Yes. Is there room for improvement? Yes. Is this a bad game? No. This is a good game, which I feel deserve a better reputation than it has gotten.  Lastly; I usally give games a score, based on a die 1d6. Unlike with a die however, a 0 is possible. This would be an abysmal failure of a game. Equally well, I occasionally deal with x.5. This is in this second category. I do recommend this game to fans of WH40K and those who otherwise are fans of Space Fantasy games.  - 4.5 out of 6.",

            "review_text": "I wanted to like this game. I wanted to, so badly.  Not just as a part-time (non-tabletop) warhammer fan, but also as a lover of fleet battles.  Let's sart with the positives;  - Amazing voice acting; everything you can hope for is present in this department, both in multiplayer and outside it. - Cutscenes and general art direction are absolutely amazing. Whoever was on the art team knew what they were doing completely. - Campaign is a solid 30-40 enjoyable hours and the main flaws of the game, while still present, aren't that bad there. - It's Warhammer.  However, these positives don't outweigh the negatives;  - Multiplayer is an umitigated disaster; there is, at most, ~200-300 players on at any one time, and according to steamcharts that isn't even guarenteed to be people on multiplayer. For the longest time the progression system, the same one in the campaign, was present in multi - one of the worst design choices I have ever seen in a game. It absolutely devastated the mulitplayer community and, now even with ranked (which removes it), I don't think the community will recover.   The fact is, with the progression system if you lost a ship in a fight, you couldn't use the same ship in the next 1-2 matches(you can otherwise spend points on fixing it, but that just sent you behind and forced you to grind even more). This means, before you can get the real goodies, you have to have your teeth kicked in basically on principle and without exception, no matter how good you are, a tleast a few times. And with a dwindling playerbase, the life of a noob got very hard, very fast, as you were put up against pros. It destroyed the community in the single worst decision I have seen an otherwise competent dev make.  - The factions are broken. While Chaos is at a good place, and Imperial Navy is playable, Orks are horribly overpowered (now from when they weren't, they used to be a joke of a faction) and basically can't be beaten by anyone. They have stronger everything until the devs decide to nerf them, where they will once again be worthless. The Eldar used to be unbeatable, but now they are the joke faction. This constant swing between god-tier and ♥♥♥♥-tier make playing multiplayer like putting your life savings on black.  - The missions are a joke. What if I told you that on some mission modes, both in single-player and not, it's literally impossible for you to win? Well, that's the reality in BFG. Planetary Assault and Starbase Assault, for instance, are basically unbeatable as the attacker in both instances, although Planetary can be just as bad for the defender if RNGesus frowns on you as the results are completely up to chance.   - I will quote the lead Dev himself: 'I am uncocnerned about balance.' Yes, that's literally what they said.  - With multiplayer dead and untouchable, single player is worth maybe $20, not the 40 they charge.  As I said, I wanted to like this game.",

            "review_text": "In the short time that I have been playing Battlefleet Gothic: Armada (since two weeks ago during the beta stages of the game) I have fallen in love with the mechanics and the gameplay. It is probably the best game that I have played in quite a while and I've found myself always coming back to it within a few hours of closing it. The multiplayer has so many options and there is so many ways to customise and tune your ship to certain situations. If you are a fan of Warhammer 40,000 as well, then you are in for a treat as this ties in with the lore as well as telling the story of the 12th Black Crusade of Chaos against the Imperium of Man in the Gothic Sector.   By far, my fondest moment in this game is trying to take down an enemy vessel, during an data recovery or an assassination mission, while it is charging up their warp engines. Watching the little blue bar climbing, higher and higher, towards the end of the 'charge-up' bar makes your heart beat, your hands sweat and a surge of fear and zeal strikes you as you realise that this is the make it or break it moment and determines whether you win or lose. My second favour moment so far in the game is hiding my 'admiral' ship inside of an asteroid field during the very same type of gamemode and using my other ships to lure the enemy away. Not once have I seen someone that has been able to figure out this tactic until the last moment when I micro-warp jump my 'admiral' ship into clear-view and then activate the warp-engines and quickly escape the battlefield and bring myself to victory.   I completely whole-heartly recommend this game to anyone that is interested in an RTS game that just WORKs. It has leveled itself with my favour RTS game (Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion) and there is still more to come from it in the near and distant future.   Buy this game, it is worth it.",

            "review_text": "Let's look at this realistically.  Ever since Soulstorm came out, I've really not had the enjoyment of a Wahammer game. I felt Space Marine was okay, but not great. Dawn of War 2 in my opinion was a complete waste of time and money, for me and the devs. Definitely wasn't a Dawn of war game.   This, definitely had the grim future feel to it. Although the 'fleets' you put into the battle are not fleets, merely a few ships, it still has such a good vibe to it. The fact that you can command these epic ships into battle and have them fire lances of raw energy at another and then watch it explode in half, just to see another ship drive through and push the debri away is aweworthy.   As a Tyranid player with the models, I am really looking forward to dlc releases in the future for factions, such as Tau, Space Marine and Tyranids, etcetera. I believe this game has SO much potential. I cannot stress it enough how much this game could achieve.  This was worth every penny. I'm getting so much enjoyment from it.  Tl:dr: Is ver gud v nic i lek it. 11/10 would WAAAAAGH again.",

            "review_text": "Being the wrong side of forty, cough cough, and having played the original GW game all those years a go. I bring ancient, ahem cough, wisdom to this short review.   Spaceships and factions are all very well rendered with the unreal engine bringing them to life in very dark and atmospheric ways. The various missions conform for the most part to the original game. The campaign cut scenes are engaging and moving. Unlike the turn based original, all the action occurs in real time, with a bullet time option to slow things down giving you time to zoom in to the action and behold the carnage. Of course this also gives you time to issue new orders when things get crazy and put together tactical plays.   The empire ships feel spot on and just as I imagined from the original turn based game. Slow but purposeful with strong fire power good armor and exceedingly slow speed.   Chaos seem a little weak on long range firepower relying heavily on lances and suffer from weaker armor but have faster speed than the empire.   The Orc ships are well presented but are heavily reliant on micro warp jump and taunt to close with faster more manuverable ships ie everyone else !   If you love pressure and extreme micro management then the Eldar are your fleet of choice. They come with some very strong firepower but lack armor and are extremely fragile. The holoshields their ships hide behind require that the player keeps them on the move. The faster they go the harder the eldar corsairs are to hit.   With space marines just around the corner and another yet to be announced new fleet in the works this game is full of potential and so far goes a long way to realising that BFG itch that resides in the hearts and minds of the GW faithful. It's also a pretty fine two dimensional ship to ship combat game. What more can I say ? WAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRGGGG ! Blood for the Blood God ! and in the name of the Emperor enjoy ! ",

This might be the best representation of the space ships of Warhammer we've ever seen. The game is extremely faithful to the 40K lore, from the writting down to the ship visuals, weapons and locations.   The one down side is the nature of some of the skirmish missions (which incidentally are the same missions you'll encounter in the campaign). Some of the mission objectives are incredibly frustrating and the randomized nature of the maps and enemy composition leads to difficulty spikes that sap some of the fun from the game.  That aside the game is a lot of fun with an enjoyable progression system and the ability to play as 4 (later 6) factions in skirmish and multiplayer, all faithful to the 40K universe. I would like to see more cosmetic customizations and would really like some additional campaigns from the other factions (currently the Imperium of Man has a campaign).",

Battlefleet Gothic is based on the table-top game of the same name, set in the 40K universe during an event known as the Gothic War. Unlike the Dawn of War series or Starcraft, Battlefleet focuses on space-combat, similar to Homeworld, instead of ground-combat.   Gameplay involve building and controlling (in real-time) a fleet of massive, hulking piece of armoured space ships from the many diverse races of the 40K universe. The big and massive hulking, heavily armoured cathedral battleships of the Imperial Navy to the mechanical ramshackles that are the Greenskins ships or the light and highly manuverable Elder ships. Battlefleet Gothic: Armada brings the ships to life. A from time to time, you will enter tactical mode were you'll slow time and move your ships to new positions to either attack or retreat from incoming attacks.   Buy if: Looking for a new and fresh take on RTS games and you are fan of the 40K or RTS space battles. Also like micromanaging multiple ships at once and at a fast pace.

            "review_text": "TL;DR: Gameplay isn't very fun, graphics are good, atmospheric as hell. Also very expensive for the amount of game you get. I paid $20 for it and that was probably still too much.   Pros:  -Good art direction, writing, and voice acting make this a really good 'Warhammer game,' which is something of its own genre now. As somebody who's played almost every 'Warhammer video game' including the crappier ones, I can speak to the quality of the work that's been put into making it seem Warhammer-y.  -Graphics are fine. The ships are rendered beautifully and the battlefield hazards are all very interesting to look at.  -Space Marines are suitably OP.  -Cheaper, less time-intensive, and more fun than the board game. Of course, there's no real interaction with another human either, which cheapens the experience. But it beats the hell out of putting a second mortgage on your house and spending uncounted aeons painting each individual cathedral spire on your fidly Imperial ships just to watch some guy with a XXXL Metallica t-shirt and bad breath smash your pretty fleet to bits with a thousand unpainted Ork Kroozers.   Cons:  -Not a fun game. The basic gameplay mechanic essentially amounts to waiting for your slow-moving ships to float close enough to the enemy's slow-moving ships so they can exchange some courtesy laser-fire and then go on their merry way. The game's 'skill' system doesn't do much to switch this up, either, and the genuinely execrable AI complicates matters further. Ships are slow and unresponsive. This is true of both the Imperial ships, which are apparently supposed to be slow, and the Eldar ships, which are supposed to be swift but fragile. (I think their recipe for the Eldar ships contained too much fragile and not enough swift.) The other races deal with the same issues of bloated irresponsiveness, but slightly overcome them in different ways; Chaos ships all have LAZORS which hit from a really long range so it doesn't matter that their ships are slow as molasses. Space Marines and Orks, by contrast, actually move pretty quick, and have heavy armor and a fun ramming mechanic, respectively. Not sure what the Tau play like; I'm not a filthy fish-communist.   -Unfortunately, as far as I'm aware, you can only play the campaign as the dull-as-dishwater Imperial Navy, which has probably the least intersting gameplay of any of the factions. This is sad, as I like story-driven games, and I liked the characters in the campaign (though I'll admit I haven't gotten far into it), but I was chased off by the boring and frustrating gameplay.   -It's too pricey. There's not $40 worth of game here. There's hardly $20 worth of game here. If it goes on sale at ~75% off, then it's worth it. Otherwise, they're charging you too much. (Still cheaper than the actual miniatures though. Thanks, GW.)",

It still has bugs, but are getting sorted out as the go along, and the only down side as an early adopter, still no space marine fleet, which they worded incorrectly, (like GW itself does occasionaly,) implying it would be a few weeks, (By definition 2 or 3 weeks) but it has been one month and 2 weeks (This was posted on june 3rd). It also implied that the early adopter would recieve it before the non early adopters.

The game already costs 30 dollars and for that price 6 dollar DLCs is a bit too much for one race. Love them though xD 3. Dark future. It's not certain what will happen to the game in the future. Will there be other races like DE Crons or Nids more content ot balance patches. GW games tend to be left somewhat unfinished.  Summary. Do you like tactics? Do you like 40k? If either answer is 'yes' just buy it.",

            "review_text": "I wouldn't recommend this game at this time.  There are quite a few bugs left from the Beta, and some new ones to spice things up for you heh. For example I have had to give up playing the campaign due to a Fatal Error occuring frequently in mid-mission, which is when you can't save, the frustration can be felt quite strongly when you're doing one of the longer Story missions and just as you were about to win, Fatal Error. There is another frustrating bug that still occurs from Beta, where you get a UI option over a ship to Execute a captain that is routing from the battlefield, but the button is not clickable. This occurs so often that it feels like there is a dice roll to figure out if your allowed to click it. There is also another quite annoying bug in multiplayer, where you will spend Renown to get your ships back, but quite often the connection times out forcing you to force close the game, when you get back the Renown will be spent, but your ships will still be damaged, as if you hadn't spent it.  Speaking of UI, it is quite clunky, where you have to individually place each ship down while deploying, and if you want to redeploy, you can't just drag a box around them and select where you want them to shift over to, you have to click the UI button over each the ship to tell it you want to redeploy that individual ship. Which can be frustrating when your stuck using a majority of escort ships due to most of your fleet being stuck in the warp or too damaged to fight. There is also no way to lock fleet formations, so you'll likely have ships going at different speeds towards the enemy, even if you put them in a Selection Group (Ctrl+1, 2, 3, etc), as well as have them line up in a generic horizontal line if you do a group move order anywhere, which will lead to some ships deciding to cross into each other's path, causing crashes. It can also be quite frustrating since in the campaign, they suggest that you group your small fleet close together to cover one another, but it's quite difficult to do that without a lot of unnecessary micromanagement. If you're stuck doing a Transport Escort mission, good luck trying hide them in the center of your fleet, without your fleet abandoning them.  If your ships either get lost in the warp or destroyed, or even heavily damaged and kept out for several 'Turns' (they basically 1:1 used the same mechanics as the turn based campaign for the multiplayer), you'll likely just enter missions with the minimum cruisers, and as many escort ships as you can get, just to warp out before you get hit too hard. Rinsing and repeating this same tactic until your other ships are ready to battle again for a real fight. I really feel like this was a bad idea and leads to you not wanting to bother actually playing missions until you have enough of your ships returned to service.  Another issue I have is the map, you can't really zoom out too far to see the full view of the area. You have a mini map, but it seems that unidentified ships don't show up in it, so you'll have to tilt your camera to a horizon position or scroll around to see where all the enemies are constantly.  The missions themselves that I have seen so far are not too engaging.    Cruiser Clash:  Which is just a deathmatch between your fleets, the most fun mission you'll enjoy playing in my opinion.  Transport Escort:  Which is you escorting or defending against these extremely slow and unwieldy transports, and due to not having any fleet formations, you will likely only use the same strategy of making it look like your defending your transports on one side, while you have your Transports use Running Silent to slowly move towards the end zone from the far opposite side of the map.  Assassination:  Where you must kill the enemy flagship or defend your own before they warp out, more often than not you'll be doing a Benny Hill chase (especially against Eldar and Chaos) and they'll warp out before you can get to them.  Data Recovery : It's basically boarding tag, board the defender's ship with the data, take it, then hope you can warp out before they take it back but it ends up being a chase the enemy ships and hope you can catch up, as well as have their shields down before they warp out of the area. Probably one of the more annoying missions, depending on which faction you are.   Planetary Assault : You have go over these timed spots to bombard the planet, or stop the enemy from going there. Good luck if you're fighting Eldar or Chaos, since they'll likely get to those bombard spots before you can get over to them, and it'll take time to actually kill them, even if you catch up, so they'll just slide right in and move to the edge of the map until next bombardment time. As defender you also start off at the edge of the map, meaning you have to get to the middle area to try and slow down the enemy ships. It would be nice if defenders had an early indicator of where the bombard zone would be, so that they could place units near there or do a ruse by putting ships in locations to fake out the enemy.   I love the Warhammer 40k, as well as the tall ships in space theme and there are quite a few neat ideas but I just can't recommend it right now. It feels like it needs a lot of love to really shine, and I truly hope the devs can provide it.",

The combat is very engaging and heavy in strategy, forcing you to always look at the big picture, and you cannot allow yourself to ignore even the smaller ships.  Another great feature is how widely a battle can swing with a well placed hit or an inopportune time for one of your ships to mutiny, forcing you to immediately deal with that ship else have it flee from battle. The ability to focus-fire on core targets such as weapons and engines is also a key feature that I do enjoy. Plus on the other end of the spectrum the customization of your fleet and individual ships appears very appealing.  Importantly, from what little I have seen of the campaign, it seems to have a good story being built around it and seems to have a rather open-end style of growth where actions can change later outcomes, rather than a linear 'on the rail' method of storytelling.  The downsides of the game is some of the matches that it has to offer, namely the defense matches. I find that the objects I have to defend never survive the battle as the AI is entirely reckless in its attempt to kill the objective, and the platforms/convoy ships have hopeless amounts of armor/HP. I find that when I play the matchups, its almost easier to just let them win so I can try a different match. This fault may ultimately be a fault in my gameplay style, but it also may be the fault in the game itself, that is for the player to decide.

No crafting systems or basebuilding or companion gathering where it feels tacked on.   And this approach, this focus, pays off big time- that simple idea of fleet to fleet combat is executed beautifully in this game. It's easy to pick up the basics, but you can spend dozens of hours learning the intricate details of strategy here because of the depth of the combat. Ships take compartmentalized damage, various systems can be destroyed, and crews can mutiny- it's your job as a commander to figure out how to induce these problems for your enemy and how to adapt to overcome them when they happen to you.   Each of the factions feels completely different from each other, both in presentation (which is beautifully true to 40k lore) and in gameplay style. The presentation of the game never ceases to impress, even the menus and GUI feel so perfect for the 40k setting, and the graphics are gorgeous.   Overall, a must-buy if you're a 40k fan, and even if you don't like the setting you should give this a good hard look because it's one of the best real time tactics/strategy games in years",

            "review_text": "I had a really tough time thinking, should I leave a positive or a negative review. As you see, I chose to make it positive, but it is a really cautious recomendation, and to make it more clear, I will start from a negative part of the game.  Cons: -First of all, the game is nothing more but a beta. It has bugs, it has lags, servers cant handle their job and go offline, and finally, the game simply crashes. Not to mention such funny stuff as random controls problems, that prevent you from moving or using any skills, which is bad on its own, but is even worse cause of 'hangar multiplayer lobbies'. -Apart from bugs I want to mention heavy balance issues. While many old players (or the ones, who are good at such type of games) figured how to win regardless of situation, some newer and less hardcore ones really suffer from said balance. Some missions for some factions may be a real nightmare (convoy defence is the most problematic for new players, who get killed in 2 minutes with no chances of survival), some races can just outdamage you in first seconds of combat (pulsar eldar is a bit too good). -Somewhat linked to the previous issue, ship variety. The game has 'hangar' where you manage your fleet, from which you select ship to fight a battle. So what is the problem here? Well, first, you have a VERY limited number of active vessels per class. Second, some of said 'classes' have only one option of vessel to select from (hello orks and eldar), others have a situation where you either select one good option, or pick any other and get a much worse one (that is for chaos and imperium). Pluss, I must mention that not all options were brought here from tabletop, so it really limits you, if you want to get your fleet from tabletop on a new playground.  Pros: -Spirit of the game. Yes, it is 100% WH 40k. It is pure 'grim dark future'. And if you are into it, as I am myself, you will find yourself roleplaying with your enemies, accusing each other in heresy, following the false God-Emperor, being a primitive creature or simply yelling WAAAAAAAAAAAAGH on top of your lungs. After some other games, after dull insults or simple 'gl hf' such a great start of each combat gives this game 100 bonus points in my eyes. -Each faction has its own unique playstyle and personality. Want to implement hit'n'run tactics? Eldar are waiting for you. Want to endure every single battle and defeat your enemies with an ocean of pathos? Imperium of Man stands storng! Want to go rebelious against the system? Chaos is that. Want to laugh maniacally and ram into enemies with guns blazing? DA BOYZ ARE HERE!  -Progression system feels really great. You gather your power, customize each vessel to do the job you want it to do, get levels, skills, gear and crew, recover them from half-dead state. While it has some issues and can kinda limit you, it also allows you not only to win in combat itself, but actually make this win much easier by carefull preparation and planning. -Single campain seems to be pretty close to the official back, pluss it adds up even more strategical depth in planning your battles. -It looks and sounds really great.   TL;DR version/summary: the game has its issues and they can be even a bit gamebreaking right now, but even now the feel about the game, fun and euphoria from gameplay are enough for me to recommend it. And if the developer fixes all the problems and gets even more content they already promissed, the game will be my GOTY candidate.",

Granted there are some issues, as there is with every game. One of these is some of the missions can be extreemly one sided very quickly just by the line up of the opposing ships and the mission in particular. For example;  Data Recovery as the Imperium against either the Eldar or Chaos, both of which are much faster than the Imperial ships of the line. Eldar in general are a pain to both play as and against as the micro managment required is insane, and if you happento go against someone who has skillfully mastered this ability to micro manage then frankly, you're stuffed.  Par that imo the only other issue is the ship abilities, some of which are really over powered others of which are useless.  However despite all the 'bad' stuff about the game it makes it much more of a challenge, mix that in with a Campaign which does actually punish you for failing a mission or whatever and you've got one hell of a good game.",

Cons: A lot of builds are straight from the net. About 90% of the time you can do a search for Orc builds and it will be the one you are facing. Some balance issues, but it is the same as the table top. The map takes a bit to get used to. All the visuals that you can see under the map that have nothing to do with the game can be a problem. The key bindings that are standard are so misplaced its insane A lot of elitist jerks on here who complain its not the same as the tabletop game. Pros: Fun Games are a lot shorter then the table version Some crazy people do play just for fun and not all out min/max, Ran into a Eldar player that loved to ram. Easy to learn and worth the effort to master  Its a good game, Just have to wait for my Necrons ( if ever).  If you like the table top game you will like this.",

            "review_text": "I'm really in the middle with this game so far. The premise is promising, the gameplay is unique to me and quite a lot of fun. I so far haven't experienced any real bugs like some others are saying. My main gripe really is with the game modes.  Some of them are a blast and just let you experience the tactical nature of the game, but others feel cheap or remove all tactics and force you down a singular route. I can understand the numerous game modes to try and keep it fresh and offer variety. But when there are modes where you have to either destroy a single ship or steal data from a ship and escape they aren't so much unique as simply dull. The defender basically just tries to run away as much as they can for the duration while the attacker ignores all other ships and just rushes the target.  There is little room for tactical or strategic thinking, there is only one clear path to success given the highly limited time to accomplish the goal. And it is this mode plus Planetary Assault where you have randomly appearing points you have to get a ship to in an arbitrary time limit or else you don't bomb some target in time that you really feel the lack of speed with the Imperials and Orks.   It sounds so far like I'm whaling on the game, but thats simply because I'm frustrated. It is a game that has such potential, amazing visuals, unique and interesting gameplay that is held up by ill thought out game modes that sap the fun.  I really hope they make changes to game modes, tweaking the boring ones to allow for multiple strategies or at least making them more optional in the campaign/skirmish to which modes you take on. Overall I'd recommend this game if you can be patient, learn it and are able to get through some potentially irrating modes for the more fun moments. For me I can't see myself getting too invested in it as it currently is due to the frustration factor, but it certainly will be a game I'll play from time to time to experience its unique and fun gameplay (When the random mode I get will allow me to)",

There's a lot of depth in the options you have customizing your fleet. You choose activated abilities, passive perks, and out and out stat increases for each of your 'line' ships (anything larger than a destroyer). It's an overwhelming interface at first, but after you play a few games you really start to understand how everything meshes together. You level up fleets for each of the factions individually, so there's a lot of replay value. One interesting dynamic is that you level up individual ships, not catagories of ships. If a ship is destroyed in a battle, it won't be available in the next few battles. You can warp out damaged ships to try and save them for next time, or risk everything for that win.  The combat itself is about rotation and maximizing the weapons on every ship. Some ships have powerful broadsides, while some have prow based weapons. Torpedos are fired manually, deal heavy damage, and have infinite range; however they only move slightly faster than the ships themselves. They function both as a long range game for positioning fleets, and close range damage bursts. There are fighters, bombers, and boarding mechanisms, as well as point defense to combat all of those and torpedos.   All of that being said, this game is currently quite buggy, and it's a damn shame. Sometimes random abilities won't work, and I drop from about 20% of the games I play online for no reason. Does that suck? Yes, but I think it's worth it for this unique experience. The game also hasn't been out for long, and I am sure they will update it and fix things. The Space Marine fleet is already on the way, and there is another unnamed fleet too, maybe Tau!   ",

There are a few but serious bugs like a stucked camera in the midst of action with no way to fix it or a random defeat / victory with a message that either you or your opponent surrendered without actually doing it. Furthermore the matchmaking is a real pain in the ♥♥♥♥, because there seems to be actually no balancing but just randomly paired matches like a Level 2 Admiral facing a Level 7 Admiral with all the benefits of his rank. By the way, the general balancing needs a revision, too. I got the impression that speed and range currently outmatch everything else, especially with a majority of missions in which you need to either chase a specific enemy ship as an attacker or as a defender try to prevent the enemy fleet from getting close to your ships. In both cases the faster fleet will mostly win.   Nevertheless, I recommend this game, because I'm confident that this issues will be fixed with the next updates.",

At present the game offers an interesting single player campaign as the imperial navy, on a large scale world map (think dawn of war soulstorm). Unlike so many recent RTS games the AI will beat you! I have lost a number of missions on the harder difficulty settings. Instead of this resulting in a game over and thus encouraging 'save scumming' the story line evolves, building your defeat into the narrative and leading to a more nuanced and engaging single player experience. While the story line itself isnt going to win any oscars, and the twists can be a bit telegraphed the way in which it incorporates your defeats makes up for this.  The battles themselves are smaller, personal affairs - think company of heros but with spaceship. With you controlling from 2 - 6 ships in fast paced, ship to ship engagements where facing, positioning and appropirate use of abilities is key. An active 'pause' button allows you to slow down time both in single player and mutliplayer ensuring that players of all abilities have the time to effectively micro (and also to appriciative the graphics and explosions).  Multiplayer involves 4 races that each play very differently. Everyone will find a race that appeals to their play styles but you will need to be adaptably as there is always a race that will hard counter your advantages - so adaptability is key. Games last from 3 - 10 minutes, with a hard 20 min time limit. Mission structures are a little hit and miss, particularly convoy missions that involve transport defence BUT this is NOT an e-sport. Games are short, you can easily get in 10 in an hour. Much like a game like hearthstone, you will lose just as regularly as you win but the fast pace and short game time negates any hard feelings.  Balance is being continuely worked on - with patches in the BETA coming regularly.  While the game is a great stand alone product - providing hours of enjoyment (30 hours and still going for me) I am most excited for its post launch dlc and potenial as a platform for further expansion.  The introduction of new fleets, the potenial for extended single player campaigns, the potenial for an army painter introduction. All these offer exciting opportunities to extend the life of this game. While only the former is confirmed this game has a huge ammount of potenial for further development. More importantly none of these things are currently in the game and hidden behind a pay wall. It is clear that the developer is actively working on expanding the experience post launch and for this reason I would be happy to pay for DLC to cover the costs for the time and effort in creating these. UNLIKE WARHAMMER TOTAL WAR where races are being INTENTIONALLY locked off despite being in the game! The only pity is that mod support is not inbuilt - think Xcom 1 rather than Xcom 2.  My advice - buy it and try it. The game provides both bite sized RTS single / multiplayer missions for when you only have 30 minutes to spare AND a lengthy single player campaign / mutiplayer ship development for those with more time.  Anyway enough typing - I am off to play and forge a narrative for my mutiplayer fleet. DEATH TO THE HERETIC! FULL AHEAD AND BRACE FOR RAMMING!",

            "review_text": "Great game for all 40k fans and for fans of tactical space combat. That said its not like Homeworld, but more like Nexus: The Jupiter Incident. No base building, just managing your fleet mission to mission.  graphics: Game is very pretty and ship models are very well done.  Gameplay: While there is a learning curve, anyone can get the hang of it with enough practice. I have found that the auto use feature is a must for skills. Helps out hugely on the mirco so you just have to worry about torpedoes and nova cannons. There is a decent amount of grinding in order to lvl up your admiral and ships, but battles are pretty fast, so you can get to battleships pretty quickly. For now, we can only use 4-6 ships per battle, so we don't get overwhelmed trying to control so many ships and all their abilities and skills.  Campaign: If you played Dawn of War 2 and enjoyed it, you will enjoy this. Similar mission structure with a limited amoutn of deployment per turn, making us choose what benefits we want to keep. I have yet to finish the campaign, but I have been enjoying it immensely.   Skirmish: Here we get to try out all 4 fleets (for now) against the AI. AI is decent to play againts and will provide a decent enough challange on normal.   Multiplayer: Can't say anything here, I generally don't play online.  Overall its a fun game. Some features are still missing, but the devs have been putting out huge patches every single week since the beta started fixing bugs and tweaking the balance. We have 2 new fleets incoming in the next few months, so I see plenty of future support and content from the devs. So give this game a chance. It might be difficult at first, but once you get past the learning curve, its tons of fun.",

It would be nice if one could choose the paint job and appearance of the ship though, but the favour upgrades allow for that to a degree at least.  The gameplay is excellent, with fast paced and tactically in depth battles, with each one being different to the next and a reasonable variety of mission styles, plus a decent campaign. The ability to level ships and customise their skills, crew and tech as well as different hulls to enable a fleet tailored to ones desire is also fantastic.

            "review_text": "This game at the moment gets an 8/10 when it was released. This game is literially a rip right from the table top version of battlefleet gothic but this is a real time strategy game. No dice. Not a turn based game.  It is a fantastic game which was a surprise to me as it is better than what I thought this game would be. The story is split into 5 chapters and a prologue. The prologue consists of you learning the game along with following the story. Over the course of the 5 chapters, several events in the story line and lore of W40k occurs. Each chapter consists of events that occur during the years that each chapter covers before and during the 12th Black Crusade.  Story/Campaign: You play as Admiral Spire of the Imperial Navy Battlefleet Gothic. It is your job to defend the systems and it's planets of the Gothic Sector from Traitor forces, Chaos forces, Eldar and Ork pirates during the events that take place during the 12th Black Crusade as Abbadon the Despoiler decides to attack the Gothic Sector.  I loved the campaign but there are very repetative missions (at least they are quick. But seriously playing Data Retrieval over and over and over again is repetative). The cutscenes are amazing! The music, voice acting and sound is amazing. The choices and mission results in some cases have an impact to the game!  This game consists on a space battles on a 2-D space using several ship types - escorts, light cruisers, cruisers, battlecruisers and battleships. You as an admiral of one of four factions get to select these ships and upgrade them.  More Information:  Micro Management Hell People are Talking About:  This so called 'micromanagement hell' people complain about seriously makes me question if they have ever played the original Dawn of War series or Star Craft 1. Micro management in this game isn't entirely perfect, more on that later when I've finished this game's campaign, but it works! You are only controlling at best 12 ships maximum and can work with them. This game is a really good strategy game that literially rips the board game the difference really is at least on the table top version you can think about what to do each turn. This game 'solves' this the special feature that makes all of the statics and strategy in this game possible... It's called Press the Space Bar to slow down time... A lot of these people complaining about the 'micro management hell' really don't seem to understand this concept. In all honesty, this game has much less micro management than Star Craft 2 and I prefer this for casual play and enjoyment.  2-D Space:  Umm... for people complaining.. It's a rip from the table top... Stop complaining. If you don't like it don't play it. Simple as that. This game is designed to be like this not because the game developers can't comprehend 3-D space or space comabt in games, yes someone complained about this -.-, but because it was from the board game that uses a 2-D space grid.",

This game is built for a fun coordination experience between ship captains, yet they only restrict that mode to PvP.

The detail is excellent though i had to manually go to my nvidia control panel to enable the GPU, game was using my integrated card by default. The detail on the strike craft leaves something to be desired and fighters/assaultbarges/bomber squadrons feel tacked on and lacking in visual creativity. the real star of the show, ive found is the maneuvering of your ships. your weapons will for the most part auto engage, leaving it to you to set enemy priority and target subsystems in the crucial seconds before a battle, (unless you have early intel from probes, which give you additional time) but steering and turning your ships to bring weapons to bear, engage the brakes/speed boost to avoid torpedo volleys and bombs, and ramming smaller ships feels weighty and solidly done. The metagame which involves customization of your ships and ship and crew leveling in multiplayer encourages sound tactical moves as opposed to blind rushing by punishing you for losing ships to a (temporary) extent, this sees players attempting to judge whether they should commit their ships final seconds to a last ditch effort attack, or a tactical warp-jump retreat from the field to preserve their favorite capital ship and captain. The depth of customization is varied enough as it is, that when seeing an opposing fleet for the first time, it is difficult to judge what special abilities the opponent may be fielding so every battle feels different even if the ship lineup is currently a little anemic.",

This is a really good real time fleet based battle game. At first you might think it is simply point ships and let them go at it as the ships auto-fire most weapons. But anyone thinking that after just a few missions will be sorely disappointed. You earn xp for each ship sans the frigates, as well as overall xp for your the fleet admiral. The higher your admiral rank the more and the bigger, more expensive ships you can have.   The high level your ships(or the ship captains) the more abilities, skills, talents, upgrades, you can have. So say you have two cruisers of the same class, they can still get to be quiet different and fullfill different roles. Usually their are 2-4 ships for each class. Battleships and battlecruiser have carrier class and a brawler/gunship class.   During the campaign, you get to fight Eldar, Ork, Chaos, and rogue Imperial Navy. You can even ally with Eldar later on to deal with .... No spoilers....There is multitude of mission types you can choose to do, as well, although some are more preferrable to do over others. Some of them can be a major pain in the ♥♥♥♥( or a helluva challenge, depends on your perception). Oh, the four chaos 'super-dreadnoughts) can be fun to fight.  You can also do missions for the Inquisition, Mechanicas, Adeptas Astartes, and the Imperium for favor. This allows you to buy upgrades (could almost be considered Ultimates). Only one per ship. The favor lowers the price of renown you need to buy the ability. Once unlocked you can buy them right away for 2000 renown each. But the renown lowers that for each point earned. So definitely worth helping out those factions.  If you like fleet battle type games, like Warhammer 40k, well this mixes it well and it a lot of fun. The multiplay can be a blast! It incorporates most all of this sans the farming favor for factions. Most of the community is pretty chatty and pretty good people, yes, even your opponents. See ya in the void!",

I mean just turning ships around takes like forever. The thing about timed objectives (like planetary bombardment, data recovery, or assasination) is that they need you to move too fast. For assasination or similar missions, at least you kind of know when the timer for the warp will start (when you damage the target ship heavily or steal the data or whatever), so you can kind of plan for it. But even if you do, there is no guarantee your abilities to stop the warp would work, and if it fails you kind of need to have a second ship in range with it's ability cooldown ready, and even then there is no guarantee. As for objectives like bombardment, you kind of need to know where the objective will appear before it does, else you probably won't be there in time.   Also unskippable in-game cutscenes are a problem, especially when you fail a mission..which is most of the time for me. For a game of such a slow pace and limited tools, the mission objectives feel like they're from another game..they're really not compatible.

The only thing I like is cruiser clashes against players on an equal ground. Mission type Planetary Assault: Struggle to get to the randomly generated planetary bombardment zones all the way across the map or split your ships up and watch them get picked off one by one while you struggle to get them into the bombardment zones before they blow up. Data Capture: Watch in joy as faster ships run up, steal your data and run away with it and warp out before you ever have a chance to catch up. Eldar are especially ridiculous... Assassination: Everything pile on one ship and destroy it... unless that ship is faster than your ships and it just runs away until time runs out and warps out and you lose, or you get lucky and box it in. (The only reason this works is because the AI is fairly stupid in using it's abilities on this mission.) Then to make these missions more complicated they give you allies who eat half of your allotted points for the mission and your allies generally are either too weak, or too stupid to actually assist you on these missions. Unless I run my ships up to my ally and support them (and you can't always do that in these missions) They will generally get overwhelmed and die. Finally the game throws in a few campaign only mission types that do little to relieve the boredom of playing the same six or seven missions over and over and over. In small doses it can be a fun game but, it's just too much of the same thing over and over and it gets frustrating and boring.   ",

The video game version looked decent so I gave it a shot. They did a pretty good job. I haven't played multi player but enjoyed the campaign.  The voice acting was hilariously cheesy but to me it was both a pro and con. The ship models were good though I would've liked a bit more graphical personalisation to make the fleet feel like mine. Even if it was just choosing colours. The game moved too fast. This complaint isn't so much about difficulty but more about 'feel'. I pictured the ships in the 40K universe as being massive ponderous things and it didn't quite feel right unless I played in the slow mode. I think they should have just made the slow mode the normal mode with regular speed animations and then used the faster mode as a fast forward option.  All said and done, I think it's a pretty good game. Though there are a few features this game could use (mostly more visual customisation as it was based off a tabletop game where personalisation is a big part), Tindalos did a decent job adapting BFG to the digital world and fun was had.",

You can't just send them to attack and expect a victory; + Cool mechanics makes it really tactical so some decisions might cost you the match or might guarantee a win;  Cons: - Unbalance is as eternal as the Emperor; - Bugs that should've been fixed still aren't even though they were noticed during early beta and the game is now gold; - Campaign starts fun but gets boring really fast since the missions are all the same; - The studio doesn't really care about its costumers. I bought early adopter edition to support the game and get the free DLC but two days after the early adoption period ended, they gave huge discounts on both the game and DLC, making the early adoption a totally foolish thing and betraying supporters; - MP is really limited and gets boring fast. Sometimes you get matched with players with huge fleets;  Conclusion: Buy the game if you're a W40k fan like me but only do so a year from now then the game is with a 75% discount or something. Don't expect to get better also. Devs say they hear the community but some balance changes were never implemented and the DLC not only was released with a lot of bugs but is totally not worthy except for the cosmetic part.",

One problem the target is not alone. he has at least 3 buddys happy to steal the data and jump out all while you sit there waiting for your cooldowns to be ready to stop them from jumping...30 secs after they jump out.

BF:Gs multiplayer will punish you for doing it wrong but gives you the tools to come up with a strategy of your very own.   The campaign is fine and captures the spirit of WH40k very well.

            "review_text": " TL;DR   Flawed in almost every aspect gameplay alternating between boring and annoying, bought it for 25€ can not even recommend the game for that pricetag. The fullprice asked for is obscene to say the least.   Major flaws   - terribad AI I dont know how other reviews claim the AI to be good. AI maphacks like a boss, won´t attempt to dodge any torpedo which you fire basically over the entire map in the beginning of a game and yolos through every asteroid and mine field there is between you and them. Had a transport escort mission vs Orkz as Attacker and they send all their transporters through an asteroid field, leaving them at 20% hull once they reached the other end.  - annoying mission types, esspecially versus AI due to its maphacking.  - Loading times + game stability When I play with friends, we have ~1 game crash/hr played. Getting a 2 player lobby to run requires quite some effort and multiple restarts on both sides. Loading times are atrocious. Children were conceived, grew up, made their high-school diploma and programmed better games than this before you reach the main menu.  - Customization of ships with skills, favours etc. is a bubble of air due to 50% of the options just being not viable. Imperial Navy and Chaos are the only Factions with some ship type variety.  - Imbalanced, non-competetive environment + abandoned multiplayer with non existent matchmaking coupled with a progression system  - promised post-release content takes forever  - bad game design; took them 2 month to get 2 vs AI going and even that is flawed.   Campaign   Its okayish. You play as the Imperium, so the replay value of that is limited. You basically get a story mission + some randomly generated missions and since you get less deployments than there are missions you need to decide what planets to save. Story missions are okay, though I personally think taking the fights from the Battlefleet: Gothic books would have made a way better experience. Due to terribad AI and bad mission types the campaign itself alternates between annoying ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t happening (Convoy Escort + Data Recovery) and being way to easy and boring since the AI yolos its ships in your direction ignoring torpedos, terrain etc.   CO-OP   Getting the 2-player lobby to run is a pain. If you play vs AI you encounter the same issues stated above, in PvP i´ll emphasize on those issues later in the PvP section. Additionally the (smaaaalll) point pool gets split in half so you share it with your buddy. Essentially, you play with 2 ships + maybe an escort. Every.Single.Game.   PvP   So we have this 'lovely' progression system, where you play games and get reknown to buy and upgrade your stuff and to repair ships you lost. In addition, somebody decided to completely ignore the fact that upgrades and favours should result in higher point costs for that ship. Fully skilled cruiser with all upgrades costs the same points as a forge-new one. Spice this up with non-existent match-making and you are in for an awesome multiplayer expericence.. oh wait.  This is not the tabletop, where you grab a buddy and a beer, say 'okay, 5k points battle' and you have a good time. You fight random internet strangers to struggle to build up you fleet and keep them flying on a RNGesus generated maps and mission types (most of those not well received by the community for a damn good reason). All of that in a non competetive environment due to maps, point-costs and matchmaking alone without even losing a word on the faction balance issues. You imagine epic braodside space battles ? Maybe in mirror matches. Other than that you can play hide and seek for minutes and get kitet or kite somebody to death, because thats so much fun. Imperial Navy and Chaos are the only well rounded factions. Imperial Navy has as many Cruiser types as the Orks have ship types alltogether. So much playstyle variation and value there *lol* I know this is kinda true to the tabletop but hey, wasn´t me who decided to make this here a full-price RTS.  On top of that, Elvis is more alive than this multiplayer base.   Summary   Keep your hands of this junk pile. If you look at positive reviews its like 'Wooo a Warhammer game' and thats the review, gz. All of those abandoned the game with very low hours played.. for a damn good reason. Now we gave those devs the benefit of the doubt, still faction balance is in a state of permanent experimentation with no clear goal in sight, the promised content has yet to come. 2 month for the space marine fleet, not even a screenshot of the TAU yet. Little sense in donating a kidney to Caesar. Grab a Warhammer mod for Sins of a Solar Empire or wait until someone uses the 3 D models from here for a Tabletop-Simulator version of Battlefleet: Gothic. Better games.",

Both in the story and atmosphere of the game, and the gameplay. Imperials are sturdy, resolute, and have the ability to crush their enemies like the hammer of the emperor. Chaos are like a twister dagger, fast and deadly, but can't take the punishment of the imperials. Eldar are swift and lethal, but their ships are made of wet tissue. And orks are wild and deadly. They are insanely strong, but also insanely hard to control, more like holding a pack of hungry pitbulls on a leash than controlling an amry. Any 40k player should be happy with this.  -Strong story that stays true to the original tabletop campaign.  -The campaign is long and unforgiving, exactly as a void war should be.  -Good mix of gametypes in the multiplayer -Decent community -Challenging and rewarding gameplay -THE BIG RED BUTTON -The orks. Seriously too damn fun. You can get a giant snotling teleporter for a weapon. Freebootaz are the best damn thing in the void of 40k.   And here is why I would not recommend this game, for now at least Cons: -Gamebreaking bugs. The game was in beta for a month and has been out for a month now. Two months to fix the game. It has gotten better. But between 25-50% of my multiplayer games end with a fatal error crashing the game. Somewhere around 10-20% of campaign missions end with the game crashing. This is seriously ruining the game. There should not be this many errors.  -Balance. I wouldn't expect a game to have good balance shortly after release, but its still a serious issue. Any game besides cruiser clash against eldar involves the eldar skating around the map and the other player driving in circles. The nova cannon was OP, killing escorts in one shot, but they nerfed it into the ground. Its is innacurate and is so weak it can only take the shields off an escort. Orks lost their best upgrade, the engine boost, giving them no way to compete in speed. Balance is not horrible, but its not good or even okay -There are no different maps. There are different backgrounds and different amounts of space debris, but overall there is very little beside generic space. This is 40k. You can do so much in space. Live a little devs -No way to choose gametype in multplayer. If you don't like escort games, suck it up buttercup. You still gotta play them.  -You can only play with one friend -In 2v2s, games are either 600 or 700 points. This is annoying because you're always stuck with light ships. I know the game can run more ships on the map, they do so in the campaign. I don't know why they felt the need to limit this.  -Finally the minor bugs, that aren't gamebreaking. Stuff like not being able to issue special orders or use abilities in multiplayer.   Its a fun game but in its current state, it is not good. If the updates fix it to the point I no longer I have to worry about constant crashes, I'll change this review.   EDIT:  This game has an awful community of fun-hating, spite filled cry babies. The worst is a large percentage of eldar and chaos players. When they've lost the battle but they still have ships, they decide to run. Not warp away and end the game. No, they decide to run away for 20 minutes, knowing that they cannot win. They know they have no hope of winning but they know that you can't catch them and they are intent on wasting your time.   If you think about, this horrible community just puts it closer to the real tabletop one. Just like the 40k tabletop scene, this game is filled with spiteful meta drones. I'm done with this game.

Positives: Awesome graphics, the ships of W40K look stunning. Story, the game takes place duirng the gothic war from the W40K universe. Naturally, wanting to play a part in a major section of the universe makes you fell vested in the events of the game. Negative: Strategy: This game plays more like a vegas slot machine than anything. The application of strategy has little to no effect on mission success. Ships will largely autopilot themselves when engageing enemy units, which is no bad thing. Execpt for the fact that W40K ships are slow, so positioning is everything, And ships are too slow to react to any maneuvers needed to keep the upper hand. Therefore, winning is a lot of luck that your ships stay on top of the battle. Story Missions: can not be skipped. Ever. In game, you get a certain number of times you can deploy your fleet. So if half the sector is going to pot, you can't do a thing about it until the story mission is complete, which is no sure thing. A better way to do this game would be to have story missions only, instead of a story mixed with random missions to maintain your hold on a sector. Battles are far to short running at best 10 minutes in length. So, as awesome as it is to watch 5KM long ships duke it out, blink and you'll miss something. If you are a fan of W40K and XCOM, your micromanagement baby has come home. If your like me and enjoy storyline and smooth gameplay than anything else, go play DOW 1. With any luck, the developer will sell the rights to Relic who can do a proper version of this game. Heres hoping Space Hulk: Deathwing is good.",

            "review_text": "Personally, I would not recommend this game.  Not because of the buggy launch, not because of the currently MP filled with cheater.  But because this game is simply not fun, frustrating at times even. First of all let me say this : this is a not RTS game, this is more of a map-scale racing game where you can drift ship like a boss. You will find most of your time not making strategic plan and/or directing your fleets but instead juking and jiving your ship so that it can aim the only efficient weapon on the entire battleship(torpedoes) at the target. it focus too much on individual directional input at the right moment instead of fleet to fleet combat, so you should never, ever leave your ship for a second because the next thing you know 2 escort ships can destroy your gigantic battleship with nothing but minor damage.  Campaign: The level design is especially atrocious, EVERYTHING IS A TIME ATTACK, thus deny any possibility of strategy - Escort Mission all the enemy just focus on your escorts and no one else, so you can do nothing but charge. - Data Recovery Mission the objective will warp out before any of your ship can reach it without lossing half its health. - Even Death Match the enemy will warp out before you can even get into firing range.  The AI in this game is one of the worst I've experienced, like ROME II at launch, they will rush the target and the target only, and succeed sometimes because imperial cannon are made of BBs. For all the losses I've experienced, I felt cheated, cheap, you will not know exactly what to do until you fail the mission once, all the while this game try to set up this XCOM-esque 'all your decision will cost you' when in reality it's just bad level design and you loose because the game makes you. It's not fun, nothing probability, just certain failure, all the while not being able to instantly retry, and then getting scold by the Mxxxxcker Inquisitor before you can reload just build up the rage due to their irrationality  As to make it simple, this game is : PRO: -Beautiful Models. -Varieties of Ships and Difference of Races -In-Depth Upgrade/Progression System.  CON: -Atrocious Level Design and large battle is a mess since your ship move on its own. -Cheap loss, destined losses in some occasion, AI uses mostly rushing tactics and only go for the objective. -AND THAT TACTIC SOMEHOW WORKS SOMETIMES. -Too much micro and little to no macro. -Cheaping AI that can deploy static/warp bomb half the map away before your own can even get in range. -Scolding of the Mxxxxxcker inquisitor afterwards. -Unskippable Deploy Animation. -Unskippable Cutscene. -Unskippable Launch Logo sequences. -Deny of Alt+F4 during defeat animation.  All in all I think this game is doing everything it can to discourage me from playing. I don't feel the thrill or enjoyment of controlling large ship fleet battle, instead I find myself constantly cursing at the ship doing something utterly stupid when I turn my sight away for 5 seconds. The model's cool though but honestly it's its only value.  edit: oh and this game has one of the worst elitist axxwipe community that put even dark soul community in shame.",

I love the 40k universe and have been playing, reading, paiting and breathing the background for over 25 years. While this game has a reasonable backstory and good portrayal of this universe the gameplay itself lets it all down.  Taking a beloved turn-based wargame and turning it into an RTS is probably its biggest fault, however this can be a matter of opinion. I personally found the 'tutorial' (or the campaigns first few missions) to be confused and left me with many questions.   Having the option to play a turn based version of this would have sold it for me and I would be singing its praises, but as it is I can't recommend it. I wasn't intending to buy this game as I knew it was an RTS however I won my copy in a competition so decided to give it a try. Glad I didn't waste any cash on this.",

Convoy missions are an absolute joke, and the Skirmish mode doesn't let you just use any ship. You have to level up for each sub-faction within the factions. An utterly awful idea, I cannot think what possessed the developers to make them think it was a good idea. If I want to level an Admiral and unlock stuff, i'll play the campaign. Skirmish is about being able to mess around with every unit and figure out what you like about each faction, etc. And it's practically impossible to actually hit an enemy ship with torpedos, and when I actually manage to do so, the damage is vastly vastly underwhelming..

            "review_text": "I won't claim this game is perfect. There's the odd crash bug, the dialogue in the campaign missions can't be skipped, and has to be heard every time you reload/restart, and there are many ship customization options that are poorly optimized and less than useful.  None of that is enough to dissuade me from recommending it.  It's fun, it's engaging, it's easy to learn but challenging to master, and it's a pitch-perfect rendering of Warhammer 40K. Really, that's all I'd want from it.  The core gameplay is fleet-to-fleet engagements, done in real time with an option to slow it down, with a battlegroup you've leveled up and customized, and with a point-cap system for determining your fleet size. The focus is on movement and firing arcs for your weapons; the gameplay strikes a good balance between micro and macro focus. There are options for multiplayer, a singleplayer campaign and singleplayer skirmish modes. For the singleplayer modes the AI is decent; for multiplayer you are, as always, going to have to live with the fact that some players are going to kick your ♥♥♥, while others are going to offer you no challenge whatsoever (hardly the game's fault).  The one complaint I have with the singleplayer campaign is the aforementioned unskippable dialogue. On the positive side, the animated cutscenes are well done, and thematically suited to WH40K. As compared to the rest of the game, the campaign adds a strategic map layer akin to Dawn of War 2, DoW: Dark Crusade, or the newer XCom games, with strategic assets that must be secured and protected. Conversely what the campaign lacks is the ability to play as any fleet other than the Imperial Navy.  If you want to control a non-Imperial fleet in singleplayer, you'll have to make do with the skirmish mode and custom game mode. Not a deal-breaker, and skirmish mode is a good way to play a quick match against the AI, but I'd have preferred some more variety in singleplayer. The DLC for new fleet types is also expensive; I'd recommend getting it on sale, if at all.  I'd call it an ambitious attempt to bring WH40K space battles to video games, and if it isn't perfect, it's still quite good.",

            "review_text": "An adaptation of the Battlefleet Gothic specalist minitures game, Armada was created by, like many recent Warhammer 40,000-derived titles in the post-THQ age, what appeared to me to be a largely unproven developer. Also like many recent 40k games, it is an ok game that falls short of being a great one.  Thankfully for me, a strong point is in its campaign: a tale of the famous Gothic War, where Failba-er, Abaddon the Despoiler led his 12th Black Crusade against the Imperium's Gothic Sector in an attempt to gain control of the six Blackstone Fortresses, immense and ancient space stations with the firepower to destroy entire star systems. Through the eyes of original character Admiral Spire, you command the Imperial Navy in battle against Chaos, Ork and Eldar fleets, with branching paths and persistent game flow regardless of the outcome of individual battles, allowing things to go better or worse then they canonically did. The 40k mainstays of Gregorian chanting over thundering orchestras and overacting faux-Englishmen help to set the feel.  However, certain parts of the actual gameplay fall short in portraying the scale and intensity of this war and, I feel, of the setting in general. Gameplay is strictly fleet tactics- there is no base-building or resource gathering, or any other aspects of an RTS. Battles are inconsistently paced thanks to a lot of percent-chance mechanics, and restricted to a two-dimensional plane and limited by an arbitrary 'point value' as in the tabletop game, severely limiting the size of the fleet in each engagement, and for whatever reason, you are almost always outnumbered by enemy vessels. Towards the campaign's endgame I was able to field only my four most experienced ships against Abaddon's infamous Planet Killer, not to mention his infinitely respawning escorts.  Combat is extremely micromanagement-heavy, sometimes necessitating the use of the game's bullet-time function. Only your ships basic weapons are automated, requiring you to manage active abilities, heavy weapons such as torpedoes, strike craft, emergency maneuvers and virtually everything else directly. The AI is not smart enough to avoid stage hazards such as minefields and asteroids, or to dodge a speeding Ork Kroozer, though this goes for the enemies as well. The more upgrades and skills you install on your ships to give them greater survivability and lethality, the more difficult it becomes to get the most out of them- so perhaps it is better that you have fewer ships. Still, I preferred Sins of a Solar Empire's fleet combat. Armada's tutorial did not adequately explain all the game features, so much so that I was not aware that automating your abilities made them as efficient as those used by your AI opponents until after I had finished the campaign. Still, I was very proud of myself whenever I manually broadsided a Chaos ship with a full spread of my Retribution-class battleship's torpedoes.  There are a number of other modes, including online multiplayer, custom games, and skirmish vs. AI, allowing for a second player for coop, as well as post-release DLCs that add Space Marine and, if you're into them, Tau fleets",

            "review_text": "I've had a lot of fun with this game. If you enjoy the Warhammer 40k universe, then I suggest picking this game up. It's everything you would want in a 40k spaceship game. Great voice acting, visual design, and attention to the details of this universe. Everything just feels right about this title.   The campaign is quite fun, and has you protecting the Gothic Sector during the 12th Black Crusade. Chaos, Eldar, and Orks are all vying for dominance and it is up to you to destroy the xenos and purge the chaotic taint from the Gothic SEctor. Skirmish mode is the second game type, which has you create your own fleet as a part of your favorite 40k faction/race. You fight battles against the AI, or with a friend in 2 vs AI. You can even choose an Elite Mode which has the player face off against ever more powerful AI fleets. There are also 2 different multiplayer modes. The first is a classic player vs. player match where you slowly gain ranks after beating other players. The second starts the players at the maximum rank for both ships and admiral, while also giving you a lot of money for ship upgrades. The players would then fight multiple battles to determine their rank.  Maybe I'm biased, but I have fun with all of the different types of game modes.  Each faction is unique in its own special way, and even if they aren't perfectly balanced, the game is still fun to play.  The main negative point would be a lack of players for multiplayer battles, but it could be worse. Sometimes it is hard to find a game, but normally during 'primetime' there is no issue with player population. It sucks there aren't more people with this title, as it truely is an amazingly fun time.",

Structurally, it is sound. it sticks with the concept of ship to ship combat on a 2d plane, and executes this very well. THe campaign is also great in that if you fail a mission, the story goes on, but harder in some ways to represent the impacts of your failures, or easier when you win key missions.   however, the missions can get a bit grindy, and multiplayer is hard to get into, so i would recommend this game if you: -like 40k -are a fan of strategy games, and ship to ship combat in particular -love dynamic campaigns  if you are none of the above however, i would not reccomend it",
