            "review_text": "TL;DR: REDCON is a static artillery shooter that has shades of classic Worms, and FTL: Faster than Light thrown in. Combat is real time but with the ability to pause time to issue orders to soldiers and weapon batteries all at once. Core gameplay mechanics are polished and strategy goes far deeper than simply trying to shell your opponent into submission. Worth checking out when on special.   Long review:  PROS: 1; A wide assortment of weapons for you to choose from. Do you want rockets, siege mortars, standard artillery pieces, high end energy weapons? How about incendiary or poison shells? Somewhere you'll find a perfect complement of weapons to suit your playstyle.  2; Deep tactical gameplay. You'll always have to check your threat list and retarget your weapons in order to get maximum effect. Should you go after the heavy siege weapons or the power reactors? Knock out their munitions factories to slow down their rate of fire, or just destroy the guns themselves?  3; The art style is polished and well developed. Characters on the splash screens are well detailed, and watching as your in game soldiers do a celebration dance when they survive a mission is a joy to behold.  CONS: 1; No tutorial or significant tooltip help menus mean you can spend a significant amount of time flailing about in the early game not quite sure what to do with each of the resources you have to manage. No ability to sell old weapons means you have to be incredibly frugal about buying new weapons right from the start.  2; The control scheme feels somewhat restrictive. There is no ability to bind weapons or soldiers to hotkeys for rapid access, nor is there any way to click and drag to select multiple guns. Each weapon has to be targeted individually and it can be easy to overlook one and leave it firing on an already destroyed room.   3; No multiplayer. Easily this games biggest flaw is the lack of any kind or multiplayer, be it split screen, Local Area Network, or full internet matchmaking. The game is already set up into a two player split. Having a separate multiplayer mode where you get to progress your fort from a simple two room tower into a gigantic behemoth bristling with large caliber guns and tailored specifically to your whims would help extend this game's effective lifespan. As is stands, there is little to bring you back after you finish the storyline.    REDCON takes multiple cues from other games in similar genres. Most notably, it takes combat cues from games such as FTL: Faster than Light. Your objective in each mission is to destroy or otherwise subjugate an enemy stronghold using the weapons mounted on your own stronghold. Aside from simply picking targets, you have to manage the internal workings of your own base in real time, assigning soldiers to repair damaged systems or to man the various guns or support utilities. Manning weapons gives you boosts such as bonus accuracy or fire rates, while utilities give bonuses such as extra power or improved reaction times on point defences. You'll never have enough soldiers to man everything, so you have to prioritise what you need in each moment.   Tactical strategies will soon emerge in your play style. Fire one shell to distract that point defence drone only to follow up with a full volley from all your other guns. Or maybe you could launch a flashbang stun shell, only to rapidly follow it up with a neurotoxin shell and watch as the enemy quickly chokes and dies, leaving their fort ripe for the taking.   The enemy A.I. tends to be a little precognisant at times, being able to know which rooms you are targeting and moving personnel out just in the nick of time, even when they don't have a functional radar system to warn them. It can get annoying when you just have one more soldier left to take care of, but you just can't nail him.   Money is tight right off the bat. There currently is no means of salvaging or selling off old weapons once you have bought them. Those old, outdated light artillery pieces you started off with but are no longer using will just have to stay in storage forever while that fancy mark III sniper cannon mocks you with its long range bombardment abilities. If you spend foolishly in the early game, you will find the mid and late game periods harder than they have to be when you can't afford to buy upgrades or new weapon systems.    Overall, REDCON is enjoyable and has enough content to keep you occupied for 10-15 hours or so as you progress through the core storyline. Once you are done with that though, there really isn't anything left to do as the lack of multiplayer or skirmish matchups limit replay value. REDCON is quite adequately priced for the content that you get. It plays well, the music is fitting to the situation, and nothing beats nailing that final shot on the enemy's foolishly exposed nuclear reactor. If you enjoyed FTL, you'll get some enjoyment out of this.",

            "review_text": "When I first saw the screenshots, it took me right back to Tank Wars in DOS, with much improved graphics of course!  The game is artillery combat, think of Worms, but with stationary offense and defense. You need to carefully choose where to focus your assault to win the long game.  A lot of rounds will quickly turn into a war of attrition, with units repairing and healing themselves, so its critical you pick and choose your targets carefully.  The combat is similar to FTL (Faster Than Light) in that you target specific rooms, and wait for your weapons to charge. There is also the ability to pause the game to plan these attacks, just like FTL.   The graphics are very nice to look at, and I like the clever differences in the opposing sides that give a reference to how large the battle field really is.   In summary, if you like Worms, Tank Wars, or FTL, you will no doubt love this game. It's definately worth it for the price.",

            "review_text": "Been reading the negative comments about how it was too hard and unfair and tideous and whatnot; and went ahead and bought it anyways. Have to say: this game is not for everyone. I'm on a winning-streak of 10 and counting on my first play, while others whine how it was too hard. I am missing freeplay and multiplayer. Otherwise it's a neat little game. It is not too easy and that's a good thing! You have to take a close look at the enemy and need to find weaknesses in their defense and think how to crack them best, it's by no means brainless point and click. Simple minded people might miss the myriad of strategic possibilities this game brings.  It also has a puzzle-like feel to it sometimes as different enemy castles call for different specifications of your own stronghold.  It is not for: -people who want or need a lot of handholding (first few missions are tutorial-style afterwards you're on your own)  -people who want an easy game a 6-year-old could enjoy (seems to be the case with quite a lot of people) -people who look for a shooter-game that doesn't require a lot of thought   It is for:  -people who like strategy games in general and would look to add another casual titel with enough depth and funny little animations to their collection  -people who like a challenge  -people who don't play long sessions but want a fun game for the coffee-break at work  People who liked FTL will like this too. The gameplay with lots of pause for strategic arrangements is similar. For this price it's ok although makes a bit small impression as there is only campaign-mode. If you don't own FTL yet i'd recommend to spend the money on that one first though, this one has better graphics while FTL had a little more depth and content, but it's not really a clone.   The broadest content in this is weapons, rooms, layouts for your stronghold. It comes short in game-modes and musical variety.  All-in-all it's not the worst game i ever bought. I expect to get 10 to 20 hours of decent gameplay out of it at least, so it's a casual titel.   On sale, below 5 bucks price it's definately a 'buy'. For this 6-bucks-price it's an 'okay' in my book.  edit: after being a few more missions in it gets really hard, but that's ok. I see this as one of those titles you repeat coming back to for an occasional 20 minutes play. So it's a 'casual game done right'.   So in conclusion: if you are specifically looking for a casual 'cofffee-break-game' this is a good buy because it does serve that type of player really well imo. After your initial 2 or 3 hours gameplay it's the ideal casual game.  If you expect an ultra-adictive game for upwards of 200 hours gameplay and long sessions this isn't it. This is just a cute little game and actually better than most 'small games' out there.  edit 2: more missions in; the game isn't really hard at all. Challenging, yes. Too hard, no.",

            "review_text": "Great graphics, great design, great ideas, refreshing and original... with some major game-design flaws..  As you progress you buy your tower items. Unfortunately you only get so much cash and in the long run, if you spend it on the wrong equipment you will get stuck. The enemy gets so tough you can't counter them leaving you very frustrated as you try over and over again to complete something you can't complete. I like a challenge but this is rediculous.   You could restart and buy different items but the game will push various tower designs against you which go's agist the 'buy the right items' design as the paper, scissors, rock design go's against you eventually.  The game should allow free item unlocks with the idea gold is just for upgrades. At least this way you are flexible enough to try various combos to beat new levels. You don't even have the ability to play previous towers to gain more gold. Unfortunately later gme requires you to do this again by upgrading weapons to a version 2. At this stage even if you buy a different weapon you now have it at a level 1 when you may need it at level 3.  The games fix? An option to skip the level if you fail a few times. Its a dodgy, frustrating and lazy fix and you can only do it 3 times totol.   Another great flaw is the AI. They seem to have far better accuracy and the ability to know where you're going to shoot them (and thats without the Defence room that allows such a thing). For the pure stratagist this is a turn off and frustrating experience as it feels like the AI can cheat.  The game has huge potential and I want to love it but unfortunately its another cheap game that will collect dust in my library. Smart gamers will push their towers to the limit beating very hard levels but for the rest of you you will feel very frustrated and most likely rage-quit.  Buy if you like a real challenge.",

The ai is horrible so horrible that the developers made it so their rate of fire is increased, damage bonous etc. Some levels are so infuratingly difficult do to this. There is also a problem with the customization when you drag something it is not always right on the mouse. I would love to love this game, and I will still play it but the infurating ai is sometimes too much for me to play this game without taking a long break. Will change if stuff is fixed.",
