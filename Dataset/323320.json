            "review_text": "The Unity engine has come under fire as of late for being the engine of choice for people putting less savory products on Steam Greenlight. What happens when a big developer like Ubisoft Reflections uses its assets to make a game that is quite different from their normal line up? Well, you'd get Grow Home, a delightfully quaint title about a little Robot named B.U.D. (Botanical Utility Droid), who is trying to oxygenate his home world by growing and climbing the Star Seed in order to harvest its seeds.  Grow Home is a brightly colored game with low-polygon minimalistic graphics that never once takes away from the world of this odd little planet. The music is simplistic and otherworldly, giving one the sense that they are indeed on some sort of alien world with the tiny robot. There are only three tracks but they never drone on forever, it just sounds like it's part of the background in a good way. The player can run around his open world, doing whatever they want within B.U.D.'s current capabilities. The player uses the little robot's hands to climb up big things and can gather small things from the world, like flowers that help you fall slower and leaf hand gliders that allow you to soar across the planet for as long as you hold on. While this isn't necessary, if B.U.D. collects crystals that are scattered all across the world, it'll give B.U.D. a jetpack boost. Whenever you collect a certain number, the amount of time you can hover or fly around gets doubled. It's a brief power up, but used in conjunction with the other items it makes the experience all the more enjoyable.    Full Review  [www.noobfeed.com] ",

The controls are pretty much the same as in 'i am bread', except there's just two grappling points. The camera though gave me an actual headache and i had to take a pill and a break just now.  Basically you climb, jump, glide and rocket jump upwards, while collecting crystals and growing 'stems' in different directions to reach floating islands. You can also hunt for hidden caves and other 'easter eggs' like dodo birds and angry bulls. The goal is to connect stems to glowing floating islands and grow the main plant up to 2000m (1.2 miles for those savages that do not use metric system).  I did enjoy it and had quite a bit of fun. Though i must warn you that you probably need a controller to play it properly.  For those concerned - it doesn't have uplay.",

            "review_text": "It's almost a fun game, but the character control and movement drags the whole thing down. Fully procedural animation is kind of neat on principle, but in practice it really got in the way of my fun. The robot character you play as in this game is cute, but he handles with the cripness of pudding. Pudding which is also tired and drunk. Walking around feels closer to rolling a ball around than the sort of movement you expect from your standard game character, inertia seems to count nearly as much as your active input and often working against you.  Of course, walking around is only a small part of this very vertically oriented game, and motion mechanics also include a jetpack and the ability to climb on any surface at any angle. Much like walking, the jetpack also operates under strong inertia, making precise motions very difficult. Considering the scale of things though, this isn't so much a problem as the extremely limited charge it has for the vast majority of the game. It will almost never come close to getting you where you want to go, which leaves your primary method of ascent: Climbing. Unlike walking and jetpacking, climbing is actually super accurate and pretty crisp, the only problem is that it's also really slow and tedious. It also requires directly controlling the robot's hands to alternate which is gripping, which is another idea that's neat at first but gets old fast. This game isn't very long and before it was over I was already sick of climbing to get places, that alone was the biggest single control issue for me.  Beyond controls, the visuals are nice, in particular I really liked the vibrant colors and lighting. The visuals were simple but snappy, unlike the motion. And what you're actually doing - freely guiding the growth of a giant plant's vines in order for it to grow into space - is a fun and interesting concept. I never got sick of growing new vines and reaching new floating islands and looking for crystals, just the ever present slow and loose, floaty, mushy feel to all the proceedings. Even the physics for non-player objects had that feel, which wasn't helping. Had everything been tighter and snappier feeling, I probably would have enjoyed the game far more.  On a final note, for anyone who intends to play the game, (and I could certainly see people enjoying this, I'm not saying it's absolutely terrible,) and expects they'll be a completionist, here's a tip: Focus on getting all the crystals before bothering too much with everything else. The reward for that is infinite jet pack usage and an improved ability to grip stuff while flying. This makes getting everything else done far easier and less tedious.",

            "review_text": "So some of you may have notice some Game Grump videos coming out in the Steam Train branch for Grow Home, and after I saw what you could do in the game I wanted to buy it for myself. It most certainly did not disappoint. Everything it allows you to do is satisfying. The 100% crystal upgrade feels very worth the trouble finding every last crystal. The parachuting mechanics are lovely and work exactly like you'd expect. There are a few very subtle annoyances with the controls but that is rather to be expected with a game that prioritizes in procedural animations. For instance, when walking along a vine you've created, jumping or jetpacking off of it at too subtle an angle actually doesn't work, it forces your character B.U.D. to stay directly above the vine to ensure he lands back on it. This is frustrating sometimes if you get a really sturdy feel for how to control your character and want to get off of a vine with a jetpack but do not jump directly off of the side. I've even had this strange wind-force push my character to a specific side of my screen when I was jetpacking well above the vine that would try to ensure my landing on it.   But other than what are some obviously intentional (albeit not-so-polished) movement systems to help less experienced players not take tremendous falls that impede progress considering you will be walking along skinny vines so often in the game, the game left me wanting more. SO much more.   I can faithfully say that if the game had more content (like, vastly more) I'd pay up to 30 bucks for this sucker if you could do things like go to different planets or grow vines off into the distance and discover fascinating new sets of islands or humongous floating creatures that would be in and of themselves their own experience in the game to traverse/interact with on such a scale.   The game would sooner break believable animation movement than get the player stuck or have a mechanic not work the way it is trying to be used. The focus on what the player gets to do over anything else such as graphics (thus the low-poly count) and procedural animations is a lovely reminder of why this game is unique. It might seem like an Indie title with those 8 dollars and a rather simple-looking idea for the entirety of the game to be built around, but just how much you get to do with that idea is plenty enough for it to be worth it.   I bought the game and played it start to finish in 4 hours, but keep in mind a new player would take a little bit longer than this as I had a running start after watching Ross and Arin play this initially and bring my attention to it from Steam Train on Game Grumps. However that being said, the game still feels like it needs more and everybody in its community can feel this. It has far too much potential to be left categorized as a 'one-and-done' experience, which unfortunately it is at the moment. Once you finish it, odds are you will never touch it again until they update. This why I am hoping and praying they will realize just how much you could do with a game like this if it got enough attention and care with its development, and they hunker down and continually grow Grow Home into something beautiful.   While the likelihood for this is rather slim, at the very least it seems like they are giving enough attention to update it as I hear a new update of some sort if coming within the week (of this review being posted).   I do not however believe they have the capability to pull off too much more than they already have, and may unfortunately be limited to simply adding more of the same thing already available in the game's initial experience (but hopefully not in the form of DLC they want more money for, though keep in mind, this is technically Ubisoft we're talking about) because during a few cutscenes in the game, I noticed my fps drop quite noticably, meaning they are clearly ALREADY rather close to the limits of what they've built on the Unity engine here. This is a crying shame because it will probably discourage new radical ways to play the game from being considered/developed such as a massive underwater segment in the game which could be a whole new experience, or slap a massive sky whale off in the distance to tease the completionists into reaching and taming or something. Big amazing things like this that might even come with whole new mechanics to unlock would definitely sky-rocket the game's value if it could indeed be pulled off, which again, I sadly doubt.   Overall, you'll get more immersed and hooked than you'd think, I guarantee it. Anybody who loves the 'go here, go there, go anywhere' feel that so few video games can pull off without feeling like a chore in the long run will absolutely LOVE this game. Give it a try, but brace for the subtle disappointment when you hit the phase of 'what next? I want more!' and realize there isn't anymore and probably won't be beyond the types of things you've already done and mastered in Grow Home.",

            "review_text": "It's a very cute game. Controlling the character B.U.D is a bit strange at first, since he moves like he's drunk. It get's easyer when you collect more gems and upgrade him. In the beginning you do a lot of climbing and falling. As you progress it get's better as he can his jetpack to get to places more easeIy. The checkpoints are vital, for otherwise you would have to climb a long way up when you fall. The computer that talks to you; M.U.M is amusing. I loved collecting the items and scanning them.   Only things I miss in this game are textures, everything seems a bit flat, just solid color. A soundtrack; allthough it is relaxing to just hear the tree groan and a bit of ambiance sounds like animals it get's a bit boring over time. Also I wish the game was bigger, more planets, more items to scan etc. When I first started I expected there to be more, you can finish this quite quickly if you are a hardcore gamer. I am more of a casual take-my-time achievement hunting type gamer and I have already finished it apart from a couple achievements.  If you like a casual relaxing game where you can just move around as you please, collect things, grow the tree, it is worth it. Not reccomended if you have a fear of heights though",

            "review_text": "Note: I played with a gamepad.   Grow Home surprised me with its charm, strange sense of movement, and the ability to direct the growth of the plant's many stalks (Star Shoots). It's a colorful title where the main objective has you growing a plant all the way up into space where your ship rests. Along the way you can collect crystals to upgrade your character, tackle a small side mission, and upon beating the game, look forward to some post-game content. Some of the achievements are also interesting and function like a mini-challenge for the player. In its current state, you can expect around 6-7 hours of play time if you collect everything. Also, no Uplay.   The game's charm comes from its characters, colors, and wildlife. B.U.D., the robot, is a bit of klutz and will inevitably run into walls or smash into things as you make the ascent. His ragdoll animations can produce some funny results and react to everything you do with him be it grabbing, falling, jumping, or turning around (his head turns before the rest of his body does). Should you really screw up and trap B.U.D. somewhere, then robot suicide will provide a way out. You can visit any of your grave sites so long as you still playing the same session. You can also mess around with any of the big-eyed wildlife you find which was made more plentiful with the recent patch. The jetpack you unlock can be used to drop sheep (meeps in-game?) off wherever you want, such as a cave or from the top of the map. The art style is simple and functional which helps to save frames since you can grow as many stalks as you want. The lighting is what gives the game more depth due to the day and night cycle.   B.U.D. moves with momentum and purpose. He takes a couple of steps to come to a complete stop and may even need to roll a bit if you're moving very fast. This becomes an important consideration when climbing and performing risky maneuvers. Jumping from a stalk to a bouncy leaf could result in a very long fall to the ground should you not grab onto something. It takes some time to adjust, but once you realize you are controlling a lovable goof, navigating the world becomes easier. Teleporters mitigate the shame of falling down as you unlock them at various heights. The climbing, one of the main mechanics, is extremely functional and pretty much does what you want it to do. Left bumper works the left hand and right bumper works the right hand. The only difficulty comes with climbing under things so be sure to move the camera around unless you like looking through terrain.   Growing buds allows players to creatively reach new heights and gives a sense of accomplishment. It's the main draw of the game besides the sky diving aspect and both are fun every time. You can direct them however you want, but progress requires going up. Also, the fact that at any time you can look at how you explored the world and progressed is something special and makes me think, “Look at this wonderful mess I made.” You can choose whether you want to grow the Star Shoots in as efficient a way as possible, making straight lines towards all the islands, or create a wild monstrosity, filling the world with this massive plant. Be wary of growing an excessive amount of star shoots if you have a weaker computer because you will gradually lose frames the more you grow.   Hopefully, if you like the look of the game and find the gameplay intriguing, you'll give it a chance. It's a compact experience that should not disappoint.",

This game has amazing graphics i really cant enjoy them that much because of my crappy pc but they look neat even on the low settings, the game is about a little robot called B.U.D.. Botanical Utility Droid, on your quest to grow this big plant to its fullest, collect its seeds and bring them to your home planet to save the world or, kinda, you get a side quest wich rewards with a neat skin, back to the game, if you really focus on your objective you might take 1-2 hours of playing, but i really wasnt interested on just beating the game, i was interested on enjoying it at its fullest, im currently trying to get every single achivement for the game and get a 100%, i mainly didnt focus the objective at all, my own objective was to explore all of the planet, so did i and the game took me 10 hours to beat.. It was great, the controls are nice and comfortable, the climbing system is clever, and i love how B.U.D sometimes goofs and slips, but he doesnt do that frequently unless you make him dance or crash with everything...  *POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT*  At the end of the game you get the option of bringing more seeds to your home planet, i pressed YES right off the bat.. so the other star seeds are hidden all over the planet and you have to bring them to the telerouters ''I think they're called like that''  I love the idea of building, or well, making your own telerouters.  I honestly love this game and it deserves more sales and popularity.  You get cool tools and abilities, your first ability is jumping, you just have it there and you dont need anything to unlock it.. Then you unlock a zoom-in 'n out camera ''ability'' and you unlock a jet-pack with poor strenght and durability, then it gets powerful, and then even more powerful, and the last upgrade is infinite jet-pack WICH IS PRETTY NEAT and it gives you some cute goggles for your B.U.D.  The gameplay is going on your own exploring and stuff, it might not be the best thing for people who like dem ''EXTREME FPS SHOOTER EXPLOSION 360NOSCOPES''.. it has a nice soft and relaxing music and did i already mention i love this game?..  Tools, you get a flower, what do you do with it? float around, its might sound goofy and stupid but its very, VERY helpful if you have problems with the goofy tripping, next up is a leaf which you use to glide around, controls good and its pretty fun to go around with i might finish the guide right now so it doesnt become that long...  Also no U-PLAY!  Well my rating obviusly is 10/10 &lt;3  Quick Edit: So after 2 years i decided to replay the game again after a lot of goofing around with it from time to time, and i finished my promise, i finally 100%'d this game, im looking up to Grow Up now!",

And yes this game does remind me of Super Mario Galaxy in several ways, hence my genuine error just there.  I won't beat about the bush. I  love  Grow Home. It has made me squeal girlishly with delight more times than perhaps any game I've ever played, and I'm a twenty eight year old heterosexual man with a flourishing beard, and not naturally given to any emotional displays at all. I just couldn't help it with this game.  Produced by a small team under the name Ubisoft Reflections, Grow Home surprised us all a few days ago by appearing from nowhere, with very little fanfare, costing not much at all to buy, and being incredibly adorable. Credit where it's due to Ubisoft for helping a game like this germinate (sorry). Not every game has to be a forty hour tedium-athon, which they have recognised, so well done.   The premise is very, very simple. You control BUD, a 'gardening robot' who has been sent on a mission by MOM (yes, really) to cultivate a particular plant called a Star Plant, and eventually get the seeds when it blooms. What this means for you as a player is lots of climbing and jumping, as you scale the ever-growing plant and help it to keep on growing up and up. It always blooms at the 2000m mark. Graphically, things are presented with the broadstrokes. A strip of grass is represented by a flat strip of green on the ground, and animals are comprised of chunky geometric shapes, which seem bound to each other as if by magnets.   BUD himself is a funny little chap. With his glowing, saucer eyes and his floppy, spindly limbs, he's immediately memorable, like something from a pixar film, and is enormously expressive without ever saying a word. Some people have compared controlling him to being akin to Surgeon Simulator, or I Am Bread, which is to say deliberately difficult in order to frustrate and amuse the player. Now, this isn't fair. At first, it seems like BUD has a mind of his own, reeling like a drunken bending unit, and he'll frequently get caught on the scenery or stagger headfirst off the end of a cliff. He does have weight and momentum when moving, and the procedural animation controlling his movements makes him seem a bit clumsy. You'll quickly adapt, though, and within an hour or two, you'll find yourself more than capable of moving, jumping and climbing.   Speaking of climbing, you'll be doing a lot of it. As I pointed out, the ultimate objective of the game lies in growing the plant ever upwards, so you'd better be able to scale it. On a gamepad this can be achieved by alternating the left and right triggers, or the bumpers if you prefer. The left one controls BUD's left hand, logically enough, and the right one affects the other. If you engage it, BUD squeezes his little pincers and grabs on the nearest surface, handily indicated by a coloured ring at the point of contact. He won't let go until you do, or until something forcibly seperates hand from object, which is not a common occurence. With this system, you can climb a sheer cliff face, or hang desperately from a rotating asteroid, or drag a frightened sheep into a deep lake from which it will  never escape . As with so many things in this game, it's joyously simple and tactile to use: an idea which is easy to grasp (again, sorry) and provides lovely feedback to the player.   When you're not actively growing the plant, you'll be exploring the floating islands around and between which it grows. These are absolutely covered in secrets - from caves containing unique plants and creatures, to springy mushroom groves and cacti which fall apart if you bump them hard enough. Simply moving around them and seeing the sights is reward enough in itself, but there's another incentive in the form of power crystals, 100 to collect, which unlock extra abilities for you when certain milestones are reached. I won't spoil them, but they're all great fun, so snatch them up when you hear the telltale shimmering sound which means one is nearby.  I don't want to spoil any more, so I'll just finish by urging you to play this game. Sit down with a kid - preferably a family member - and gawp in wide eyed wonderment at this delightful creation. If you don't gurgle with joy, you're dead inside.",

It's just part of the game, and is totally eased if your #1 goal is to activate the teleporters.   I didn't rush the game, but I didn't strech it out. I didn't complete the data bank, but I did collect all 100 crystals. The reward for getting all 100 crystals is pretty cool, if I must say so myself. That feature will bring me back to the game for maybe another hour to just explore.  This game is the perfect game for filling in an hour or two when you're bored. I imagine if I played this game in one sitting I would get bored and tired of it. But that's just me. I don't mean to say the game is boring, but it certainly isn't an action game.

It is short (about 5 hours of gameplay, a little more if you're hunting achievements) but the utter charm of Grow Home more than makes up for it.   Graphics: Low poly with vibrant colours, and the best damn skybox ever, which looks absolutely stunning in the morning and evening (in-game day/night cycle)  Audio: Excellent OST (free DLC) that takes me back to the game every time I listen to it. Peaceful ambience during gameplay which sadly isn't included in the OST. Sound effects work very well with the game's aesthetic.  Gameplay: Once the plot was established and I was comfortable with the controls (which did not take long at all), I felt totally immersed, all the way till the end. Exploring feels great and I really felt like I earned the upgrades (which are super useful). You have the freedom to progress at your own pace and failure is not punished. Excellent map design with lots of nooks and crannies to explore. If the map was a procedurally generated planet I'd probably never stop playing it. Wonky and adorable physics. Camera works well but I wasn't totally happy with it. Controller recommended.  Performance: You could run it on integrated graphics with low FPS, but I wouldn't recommend it. GPU requirements aren't much. It would probably run better if it was written an updated version of Unity but it's fine. The game doesn't support it, but you can run it in borderless window mode with third party tools like Borderless Gaming. In-game options are adequate for a PC game.  Miscellaneous: M.O.M. from Grow Home and Toriel from Undertale are possibly the best game moms ever.  Conclusion: One of the few games that just made me feel good and provided an unforgettable experience in spite of its short gameplay.  I cannot wait to play this again in a year or 2 and be lost in its whimsy all over again.",

            "review_text": "Summary:  Simply, Grow Home was a fun, short game. You play as a robot named bud who must reach his mother ship who sort of acts like your guide in the first minutes of play. From there, you are tasked to go home by climbing the world you are given, growing and riding massive plants, and on the side you can choose to complete achievements to enhance the gameplay a little. On the way up, you collect shards which lead to new traits for bud, aiding your journey. Really, the game has no end. once you reach the top you can just mess around (Finished in 2 hours, spent another 2 exploring and collecting remaining shards). Simple art and design.  Issues:  No issues I can think of. I didn't come across any bugs or conflict with game play. This game, I believe, delivered what it intended. Personally, replay value isn't a big deal to me, but if it is for you then keep walking, cause you'll finish the game in one sitting.  The Good:  Graphics &amp; Sound - I don't think it'd be fair to judge this game by it's graphics, but I enjoyed them, especially during the night shifts of the game. Everything, as you can see from the screenshots, are poly-art (I know there's a term for this type of style but I can't remember) and I thoroughly enjoyed the environment. The soundtrack is calming, as expected from a casual game.   Gameplay - Simple to learn and finish. There isn't much of a story to keep you in the game, but the need to reach the top is what motivated me. You can play with the aim of finishing achievements. It's pretty much an easter egg hunt simulator, except you can fly, glide, jetpack, and grow some weed. I think the game is truly completed once you've collected all the shards in the map and reached the top. I tried to collect all 100 shards but there isn't much reward after doing so. just one last trait to obtain. 8/10  Overall - I recommend this game for someone who wants something you can finish in an evening. I look forward to the next Grow Home (announced at E3 2016). 8/10.",

            "review_text": "BUY/SALE/PASS: Buy  A darling little game from Ubisoft, you play as Bud as he works to grow a massive plant by riding growing vines to energy-laden stones in the sky. The flat-shading and bright colors help make the game stand out graphically as the intrepid Bud just keeps climbing and climbing. Jump, climb, float and fly, until finally you Grow Home.  Grow Home is a little Shadow of the Colossus, a little Tail of the Sun, and a whole lotta heart. Bright colors and lovely vistas keep your rapt attention as you climb higher and higher, collecting gadgets to help you raise this little sapling into a plant that stretches out into the stratosphere.  While the game is relatively short (ironic given the insane heights you eventually climb to), this helps the game in the long run; rather than let the game run its course and go stale as it drags on and on, the game ends pretty swiftly. It can be tough to buy into a game that generally lasts about three hours without collectables, but so long as you’re aware of what you pay for, I think it’s easy to find a lot of enjoyment in this fun adventure.",

            "review_text": "  (I got this game from someone in my Steam friendlist)  Grow Home is a 3rd person physics based climbing game. In the game you play as a robot who got dropped off by a spaceship to an island with a special plant. The goal is to grow the plant so that it can reach its peal state, where the flower opens. What brings special material needed for the spaceship. The game reminded me of the simplicity of FEZ, with just platforming and no real enemies, and the relaxation of De Blob 2.   The game itself is pretty simplistic in every way. The spaceship and the character even look so simplistic, that I thought in the beginning that anyone could have just made that with a 3D-editor. After a while though I saw the beauty of it, because of how it suited the game along with the colorful world.   The gameplay itself is made up of two things. The first part is mostly about climbing, which you do with the left and right hand of the character. There is a pointer on the object, which shows where you can grab with your hand. You then hold the object by holding the left or right trigger / mouse button. Thanks to the silly physics the climbing can feel clunky. In the beginning of the game it showed that it can be played with a controller. I played it with mouse and keyboard and have to say it is really no disadvantage. As you go further in the game you also explore and can unlock new things that can make your traveling easier and more fun. For instance a leaf that you can use to paraglide. Thanks to the clunky physics of the main character it comes over really silly, what makes it so funny.   The second part of the gameplay is the growing of the plant. You do this by going to the taps of the plant and grow and put them in flying ground, which gives energy to the plant to grow. This part is pretty casual friendly, because the tap that you grow will also get new taps directly. So if you didn't reach the destination you can still climb back to one of the new taps which you grow to the place. Several times though I experienced that controlling the taps was pretty difficult, because it wanted to steer its own way.   Still it can happen that you fall down. This sometimes can be a really large distance. That is why in the game you have several portals you can activate. This is really handy because if you fall all the way down you can use a portal to go all the way back up again to the other portal that you activated.    The music and environment sound is really in the background. Which gives more of that nature feeling and makes it not forced. The silly robotic sound effects also adds to the funny feeling of the game.  The narrative is mostly done with just text messages that pop up on your screen. Which are mostly silly robotic messages from the spaceship, who are happy with your progress.  All the things together in this game makes it a really joyful silly game. At the end it's fun to look back to how you have grown the plant and its branches on this island. It maybe only took me around 100 minutes to complete, what is pretty short. I guess for people who are going to play it I would recommend to explore a lot more and try to get all the collectibles and/or achievements, because that really adds to the fun and playtime. I am still satisfied with the fun time I got for playing the game.",

Level design could almost be described as minimalist, but that would be inaccurate. It has everything it needs, plenty of ambience, good details but just has a simple, elegant style to it. It's almost like this world wants you to know right up front it is a computer game but also its own universe. The world is generally a pleasure to explore with lots of hidden crystals in odd places, hidden caves etc.  Great fun.",

Many of the ideas in the game are good ones--ideas that the platforming genre rather needs, now more than ever--but the defining aspect of a platformer is not whether it has interesting or compelling ideas behind it, but whether or not the traversal mechanics are natural and enjoyable. And while Grow Home's traversal mechanics are interesting, and have a great deal of potential... they are insufficiently polished to be very enjoyable, and the tedious level design only exacerbates the problem. If I'm not having fun the first time I climb up a very tall vine to collect a glowing jewel, I'm not going to have much fun the 42nd time, either.  Grow Home also runs into the same problem every other physics-based platformer runs into: physics-based platforming simply isn't very enjoyable due to the lack of precision and control the player is able to exert over his or her avatar. If 'B.U.D.'s' movements were a bit more refined--if he could come to a stop more quickly and more precisely, if he could affect his descent with more accuracy, and project his leaps with more control... Grow Home would be a much better game.  I'll keep a hopeful eye out for a sequel to Grow Home, or any other game that attempts to iterate on it--but by itself, this game is more a novelty than anything else: something to examine for a few minutes and marvel at, and then set aside.",

Usually it's not a huge problem since you can just glider somewhere and be safe, but after you've grown the huge plant and you're asked to take the seed back home, you have to make 2 jumps, failing either results in having to climb the last section of plant, again, grabbing the seed, again, and trying to jump, again, 2 times. Problem is that for no plausible reason, after I grab the seed, the fps go wild from 20 to 40 and controls are extremely unreliable. Again, this on a machine that was able to run Bioshock Infinite at 60 fps, just no.  PS: Were those last jumps grabbing a seed really necessary (given the extremely relaxing spirit of the game)?

It is short lived game but, that doesn't mean you can't have alot of fun with Grow Home. $8 buck is a great price for a game like this. I personally believe that if Ubisoft wanted to expand this title and make a 2nd one with many more levels that would be great.

And yet, I feel quite contented with my purchase!  Grow Home is a charming game in my opinion. The character is unusually clumbsy, silent, and mostly likable. Movement is an unexpected challenge because you're given the freedom to literally go anywhere you want - and yet getting BUD to move in the right direction at the right time can be stressful. He bumbles and fumbles and sometimes falls over completely. With a little practice, however, he is more than capable for the task ahead. In fact, I found a certain satisfaction in learning and discovering more advanced movement combinations and shortcuts - your mileage may vary.  The game is short, as stated before - and there's no getting away from that. In my first playthrough I completed everything in the game within 4 hours. Subsequent playthroughs have been accomplished within an hour if you skip the 'fluff'. Even still, I find myself going back for more. The new skins that you unlock are useable on further playthroughs and make an appreciable difference in the way the game plays out while adding some visual variety. Moreover, the world is just an enjoyable place to explore.  Graphically, there's little worry about performance and very few options to change. You're given the choice of VSync, Fullscreen, and 'Quality'. That's it. The game does not support AA in any form without adding a launch command to run the game in DirectX 11 (runs natively in 9). Also, there's no AF because there are no textures... Let that sink in for a minute...  The long-short: if you want to support a creative team and you enjoy games where the objective and reward is in the exploration and journey, you'll likely really enjoy Grow Home. At $7.99, I think the price is reasonable for the hours of entertainment it has provided me.

Every plant and animal you scan gets entered into your databank, along with a description from your ship's AI, MOM, which have just the right amount of whimsey to be charming and fun without being overly corny. MOM will also chime in with random comments every once in a while as you explore the world. For how small her actual role in the game is, MOM lends a lot of warmth to the game's atmosphere.  Mechanically, I wish the game had gotten just a little bit more polish. The climbing mechanic is pretty cool, but player control on foot is more squirrely than I'd like, and the camera can be a pain sometimes.

Every so often you'll unlock a new platform to teleport to or maybe a new environment to traverse the vine, but the more progress you make just serves to make you fall even farther. - falling is debilitating. Like I stated earlier, the controls are not good. This will lead to an eventual fall... followed by another... and sometimes these falls will cause you to redo 10 minutes of climbing or more. It doesn't help that the climbing isn't fun either.   Bad gamefeel with a minimal rewards system doesn't encourage people to continue playing, resulting in a frustrating experience.

With the beautiful visuals, and the smooth gameplay, this game is delightfully zen with a good sense of purpose. And it does a great job at making the giant plant feel alive and moving. Also, I don't know about you, but I think you'd have to be a mad person to find all the collectable crystals.

The game has a really sweet, innocent, whimsical humour to it that was rather charming and a nice change from all the doom and gloom of the usual game worlds I immerse myself in. The controls felt really good, even with me using a mouse and keyboard instead of the recommended gamepad. The graphics are blocky and simple, but have their own aesthetic charm. I'd rather see simpel graphics done well than the messy kitchen sink approach!  On the downside, it's super short and I don't feel it has high replayability. I felt really immersed in it during the couple of hours it took me to harvest the starseed, during which I thoroughly explored the planet and found all sorts of cute and funny things to see and do. I spent one more trying to take everything to completion, but eventually it started to feel like a bit of a chore at 91/100 crystals and a couple of missing things to scan. I don't think I could put another few hours into this without hitting a boredom wall.  If it had more sandbox elements - say, somewhere else to go once you were done - I'd definitely play it more! I'd love it if you could visit different procedurally-generated planets, harvest stuff and then use your profits to upgrade BUD and your ship, or something like that. As it is, it feels like a really nice concept demo for a more ambitious game.  Conclusion: I got this in a bundle and it was a charming diversion for a couple of hours, but personally I wouldn't pay more than a couple of pounds/bucks/euros/whatevers for it.",

By far the most prominent part of the game is its gameplay, from the start the most prominent form of overcoming obstacles will be climbing which you directly control by holding and releasing each hand at the right moment. If you mess up it's a long way down, but thankfully you can pick up a flower or a fallen leaf in order to recover and glide through the air, which is almost as fun as the climbing part. Although I must say the platforming part can be quite annoying, because the character you control has quite floaty controls and you can easily overshoot a platform after landing on it.  I hope we continue to see such smaller games from big developers, due to their lower budget they can afford to take more risks. And in the case of Grow Home it really paid off.  7½ / 10",

This ambient intro though fails to capture the grandeur of riding bean stalks into the sky or the consistent tension between getting there and falling. In other words it should have introduced the grapple sequence and then have you do some clambering with vertigo inducing tendencies early. Regardless if you stick with it it has a lot of ideas. It's kinda like a n64 game that somehow never made it out during the Banjo-Kazooie period. The game is about exploration. See that floating island over there? if you can manage to stay you can grow a few buds out into branches and make it over there. Then there is the island's challenge for whatever goodie it holds. Grow Home is short. I'd estimate 3-5 hours and maybe 6 for all the trophies. It feels like a student project, it has little blemishes, cameras that wonk out or animations that seem buggy. It's the type of thing you might download from a kickstarter campaign, but that said it's also a proof of concept worth owning. So few 3D platformers dot the landscape of games these days and one with the precision and know how of this one much less with mechanical inventions that are way off the beaten track are far and few between, but even if Grow Home had met the n64 deadline it would have been a sleep like Space Station Silicon Valley. It's a unique game and the curious must play it there is nothing like reaching that flower in space and looking down on the patchwork of vines and branches that you conjured to get up there, however it lacks mechanics that invigorate the way Mario did or the insanity of Psychonauts it's much more of an ambient experience. Still I'm tempting to go back just to try some of the challenges that make up it's achievements. Grow Home is one of those game that's a trip, less a new genre more something that's design that will make you think differently about the nature of platform games. Well done Reflections =)",

I really hope the devs will be considering adding another world or even pregenerated worlds so no new game is the same. This game has potential to build on if they add more creatures and perhaps large area cave exploring, maybe adding other biomes. I also see potential for the same gameplay for exploring alien space station wrecks in space. Anyway this game is worth the price and will be something i see myself returning to play again in the future when i want to play something relaxing and very different. This type of game would very much suit coop play too. But i do not know if the Devs will be taking this game concept further either in DLC or a sequel. I do hope so.",

            "review_text": "Feels like a prototype born out of some animation system experiment that grew all weird and out of control. It turned out pretty good. It's fun to climb, jump and float around. There's no glowy handholds or autograbs here, you have to navigate, figure out and execute this stuff yourself, which is pretty satisfying. Movement and air control is very momentumy, which feels a bit iffy, but you get a slowdrop flower and rocket boost to help with that, and you learn to consider it, so it's ok. And if you fall it's not that big of a deal, as long as you reach and activate the checkpoints/fast travel points.  The actual growing of the plant is a pretty brilliant idea, and probably what most elevates Grow Home from other platformers. When growing a sprout you're basically making your own platform which you can then then walk and climb on, and it grows these springy leaves that boost you up. If you connect a sprout to an energy rock thing, the main star plant grows another step. So you're continually climbing higher and higher amongst these floating rocks and whatnot.   It's a climby, floating, flying 3D platformer where you construct parts of the levels and continually explore upwards. Plus it basically has agility orbs. It's a bit like a Keita Takahashi game, plus a bit of WALL-E and maybe some Rainbow Island. Or something. It's a bunch of things, which usually means it's different from most things. I like it. And no Uplay. You should buy it extra hard just because of that.",

First of all, everyone knows you can play games with controllers. Steam bends over backwards to let you know that you can play games with controllers. Second, you're wrong if the player is bad with a certain control scheme. For example, I found this game much more enjoyable using my mouse, since I wasn't running around alternately looking at the sky and the ground. So don't waste my time!  But I like this game a lot.

Managing to strike gut-churning tension through lightspeed corkscrew floragenesis, rather than half ♥♥♥♥♥ gunplay and knockoff 90s action movie dialogue, this small game is not only a charming and cutesy diversion, but plays (mostly) very smooth. BUD's clunky, procedurally animated movements WORK for this game; his oversized head teeters and yaws and even threatens to pull you off a cliff if you aren't standing absolutely steady. The fluffy yet stable physics of the robot and the planet he's on are part of the kinaesthetic challenge, which blossoms into pure fun as you grow higher and higher, with a greater and greater distance to fall should you slip...

The controls are part of the experience in Grow Home, much like in Octodad, and the game sticks with the gimmick throughout. B.U.D. the robot is just a bit clumsy, he's wobbly and unsteady, controlling him can feel a bit more like giving suggestions at times and he will often get tangled in his own appendages but it's part of the charm. I want B.U.D. to succeed because of hard he, and in turn you, have to try, because M.O.M. seems like such a nice lady and most of all I want B.U.D. to succeed because the sheer act of doing it is fun. Gems can be challenging to reach but rewarding, growing the shoots to reach islands is challenging but satisfying and dragging animals around the island is just plain silly good time.

Not recommened if you suffer from vertigo, though, as the whole point of the game is to ascend to astonishing heights and the game does a very good job of depicting those heights.  The controls are somewhat janky and the game doesn't explain them very well. BUD's 'procedurally generated' movement means that he has a lot of inertia -- slow to get moving and slow to stop once he is moving. Same applies to directing a stalk while you're growing it. I had no trouble at all with the climbing mechanism, that works great.  Semi-transparent dialogue boxes have you trying to read white text on a mostly light-colored background much of the time. I suppose it's 'cool' to have transparent UI elements but sometimes they just don't work.  I'm giving this game a thumbs-up because the concept is wonderful and beautifully realized, but be prepared to spend some time getting a handle on the controls and expect to spend much time falling from great heights.  Final nit: The 'Save and quit' mechanism sucks. Bad enough that there's only one save slot but even worse, it doesn't save your actual position in the environment, Reloading returns you to the closest 'teleporter' (same as when BUD gets destroyed through falling, drowning, etc.), then you often have a lot of climbing to do to get back up to where you were.",

The game concerns you, a robot, whose goal appears to be to get this gigantic vine plant to grow all the way to your ship. There's a lot of climbing and falling. This is various parts interesting and repetitive. Until you manage to get some upgraded rocket packs and discover the glider leaf, it is borderline frustrating to fall to your death. Once your vine has grown and you've got some upgrades, things get much less annoying.  In real life, I do have a fear of heights, and I did experience the faint tingles of vertigo as I got way up on the vine. This is one game where if I played in VR, I'd probably spray my surroundings with projectile vomit.  I'm not a fan of the controls - the Octodat-like manipulation of each hand individually as you try to climb adds some skill to things, but gets tiring pretty quick. Luckily, the game is fairly brief.  I could easily see this slipping into a 'not recommended' simply by virtue of being a bit short and not particularly deep, but the characters, sound and artwork add charm that elevates it above mediocrity.",

With graphical fidelity being one of the metrics that some people use to determine whether or not a game looks good, grow home continues to prove that you don't need tons of polygons to look good, you just need to use a little the right way. And because of the polygonal design of both protagonist BUD and the world they explore, the eyes can abandon the search for realism and ease into the vibrant colors and heartwarming look of the game, from its googly-eyed critters and quirky BUD to its plant life and sky that'd fit right in to a seuss book, the game makes you happy and curious to see more within the first minute.  The soundtrack is incredibly pleasing as well, with simple electronic beats reinforcing the core feelings of relaxation and curiosity, while the effects of the characters and environments never missed a beat, bringing a smile to the face every time a sheep's bleat is heard, or the stretching sound from a plant as it's plucked from the ground.  Overall, Grow Home is an undeniably great game thanks to its efficiency, not wasting a moment on unreal engine face physics or sweeping orchestral movements, but instead shearing everything off that doesn't contribute to the feeling of happiness, relaxation, and curiosity at its core.",

Though I do wish the world was bigger (or at least somewhat randomized to give better replay value) the game was definitely long enough if you do more than just focus on the main 2 objectives. This is one of those games where you don't mind playing for hours at a time.  There is hardly any conflict in the game. There isn't much dialogue. There's no time limits. But, it doesn't need any of these things - it's just a very original take of a relaxed exploration game. The game does a great job at giving you a sense of depth and accomplishment. Though the graphics are weird, they're also charming. If you try collecting all the power crystals, get all of the life forms scanned, and go for some of the more fun achievements, this game has several hours worth of content. If you ever played Mario Sunshine, you'd probably like this game.  There are a few cons to this game: * On the Linux version, there seems to be a slight rendering issue with the horizon, where there seems to be a black line. I feel like this could probably be fixed if the game supported anti-aliasing (which it could really use). * BUD is pointlessly clumsy. The greatest overall challenge of this game is dealing with how poorly BUD can walk. If you just run on a flat surface and turn sharp, he'll topple over himself. He's also pretty much incapable of walking up a slope greater than 15 degrees. I don't mind climbing but it gets pretty tedious when I need to climb up a slope as shallow as a wheelchair ramp. * I'd have liked the islands to be bigger with more wildlife variety. For an exploration game, it felt a little lacking. * Jetpack usage can be a little glitchy. At least half the times I fell down too far, it was because the jetpack wasn't firing when I told it to. Sometimes, it fired when I *didn't* want it to, giving me not enough fuel to make the jump.  Overall great game and highly recommended. Just take your time with it. ",
