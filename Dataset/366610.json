            "review_text": "2.5/10 People are right, nothing to see here.   Basically you collect donuts, which is 1 of three guns that it makes you auto switch to, and you don't have a choice, while the exact same looking bugs run down the little platforms and you must dodge them while you collect the donuts. The problem is many fold. The lazer gun you can kill guys with, the 2 other guns are worthless. It's ridiculous how just strictly better the one is and how bad the others are. So you are screwed if you must use other ones. Guys also just keep raining down, but start coming down both sides so quickly and close together and never let up you can't get up to upper levels, which means you can't get further, especially if you have a crappy weapon. You are basically supposed to grind the level over and over to buy upgrades. The problem is the upgrade is only for that 1 playthrough, which is as dumb as it sounds. So i played the level multiple times, bought a freeze ability I got to use once, died, and then the ability was gone and I was out donuts. You get 10-15 donuts early, and some things to buy are in the hundreds, which is super dumb.  The game says co-op, but apparently the developers know even less than consumers, because this game only has local co-op, so false advertising. Then theres only 3 TOTAL LEVELS. You only have 1 unlocked and I never got the other 2 unlocked, which are just reskins of the first. This game has about 10-15 min of actual content, not even worth the 4 dolla price. This game is the EXACT same as muffin knight, but that game is done well and has almost none of the mistakes this has. Just buy that game instead.",
