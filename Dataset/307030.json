    "description": "Fractured Soul takes the classic platformers of the 80s and doubles the action! Your unique ability to shift between two parallel dimensions allows you to weave through enemy fire, catch opponents by surprise, and leap over impossibly wide gaps by using platforms in both realities.",

            "review_text": "An enjoyably challenging platformer that also implements Ikaruga-like levels scattered throughout the game. At first, it was a bit too short for the asking price.   However, after talking with the developers about certain issues and immediatley fixing the problems thereafter, these guys deserve every penny.   If you like Mega Man or Vectorman, this is a no-brainer.  8/10",
