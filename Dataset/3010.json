            "review_text": "We can't buy Richard Burns Rally anymore, but we can buy this instead. It's not exactly a simulation (even on 'simulation' mode), but it is a ton of fun. The physics are based in reality, and you can use all of the standard techniques to induce oversteer. It's a bit easy to go sideways, especially in a FWD car, but not glaringly unrealistic. I am not a rally driver, but I checked the FWD performance against Live For Speed (an acknowledged 'realistic' sim) on its rallycross tracks, and I was able to get a similar FWD car (the Mini clone) to oversteer using throttle liftoff and brake, just like I was doing in Xpand. One funny thing is that you seem to be able to do powerslides in FWD cars in Xpand, which is obviously unrealistic. But that's fine, I just imagine that the FWD cars are AWD. The bottom line is that the physics are authentic enough that you can use the instincts you have developed in sims and have fun doing it.  Apart from physics and realism, the game is just a lot of fun to play. I have played the first stage about a dozen times, just because it's really fun. If you do nothing but play that first race, it will be more than worth the price. The stage design is one of the best things about this game: the stages are all completely crazy, with lots of tight turns and elevation changes keeping you on your toes without being unrealistic. And unlike many newer games, you don't have to sit through cutscenes, tutorials, and boring intro missions to get to the gameplay. Thankfully, you just turn it on and go right to the good part (the sideways racing).  It is an old game, so you will have to edit a configuration file if you want full 1080p resolution and 144Hz refresh rate, but it's easy. The file you're looking for is called VideoSettings.scr, and it's located in the Xpand Rally\\Data folder. The settings in the file are clearly labeled and self-explanatory. Have fun!  Edit: This game has a crazy difficulty curve. Don't try to drive insanely 'at the limit,' because some very strange things can happen with the physics at the limit. Instead, upgrade your car and drive carefully according to the pacenotes. Still a fun game and worth $5.",

This is a great game and if you can find some of the modded tracks for it you can have a lot of fun in multiplayer. For the price you can't beat it, if you're into racing games this is a good game to add to your library.",

            "review_text": "A fantastic rally game! It is pretty realistic I would say, although the handbrake doesn't work like I think it should and the game is lacking the function to add a clutch button for controller use but that doesnt ruin it at all. Plus I don't know the exact release date but I remember it being fairly old, so you have to take that in to consideration.  The Rally Championship mode is excellent, with semi-realistic damage that may need to be replaced after every event. Individual parts can become damaged.  There is are no real manufactures in here which is a let down, but the cars are all modeled after real ones and have funny knockoff names. (IE. Tiny Hooper - Mini Cooper)  $5 for a realistic rally game. It was bought for me but knowing how good it is now I probably would of paid $10 for it.  ",

Graphics are nice, gameplay is alright and it's a decently priced game. There's better rally games of course, but if you're looking for a cheap on the wallet game? This one's the way to go... not that mobile-port BS Collin Macrae Rally from Codemasters.",
