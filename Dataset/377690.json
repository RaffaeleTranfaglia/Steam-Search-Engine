As a married lesbian myself, this was a very magical and fun experience to go through and I hope more visual novels for lesbians turn out as good as this. 10/10",

            "review_text": "Wow, I usually don’t write reviews, but I kind of feel obliged to do so now, because this game deserves all the love it can get. At first I was disappointed, because right from the beginning I knew which girl to follow   Melody of course  , but I neglected the other one, so after about an hour instead of finding true love I found myself a bad ending -.- About eight hours later I was again disappointed, because now I had run through all the dialogue options and had nothing more to explore. In between lay the most enjoyable gaming experience I had this year.  Especially compelling was the heartwarming combination of artwork and character design. Aria is a believable main character, whose rational distance to her own emotions and devotion to her friends make her really likeable. Her facial expressions were charming and fitting throughout the whole story. All the love interests played well together and I enjoyed the route of every single one of them. Their traits, design, interaction and the fantastical story made me truly care for them and I was happy, when the story proceeded happily and sad, when I got bad endings. The CGs are wonderful. This altogether created an affection of the higher kind for me, because I didn’t just feel for the characters in the game, but also felt the satisfaction of experiencing a subtle hint of the author’s own joy in creating them so diligently.  Music was pretty good too. The title theme was catchy and I found myself browsing through the CG sets to enjoy the tune some more. Rest of the music was also fitting despite being less memorable. I also liked the right amount of sensitivity in the intimate scenes as well as the use of language for those and the story as a whole. A lot of thought was put in the narration, which made the novel a comfortable read.  I won’t deny that there are still some flaws. The male characters were in no way as charming as their female counterparts. The backgrounds were sometimes inappropriately repetitive. There are holes in the plot or at least some parts were not as well played out as they could have been   the whole curse for example  . Some choices seem rather irrational, too (and my last achievement and the best CG are still locked -.-). But who cares, right? (maybe all the people who aren’t into demon yuri visual novels with choices… and those who can’t appreciate good games xp   okay without personal bias I would still highly recommend this game, if you are open minded to Indie VN and Yuri, although maybe the flaws hit a bit harder here. And if for reasons unbeknownst to me you cannot connect with the characters, then maybe the art is all that’s left for you.  But with personal bias this game was just my cup of tea.  10/10  Well done and thank you, Razzart!  PS: Harem rules! ",

            "review_text": "This visual novel was..far more interesting than I thought it'd be. Unlike many other VN's I've seen, it actually had a toggle on the options screen to turn the 'Love Scenes', which I presume would be the R rated scenes, off. The story was good, along with a couple twists that are rather obvious in hindsight, but at the time were unexpected. That, along with a few good puns, made this an enjoyable read. I might not have been green with envy about not having played it before purchasing it, but I'm not regretting the purchase now.",
