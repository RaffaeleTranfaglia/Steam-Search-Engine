The game takes you to the good old days and you will experience the charming farming of the 60's and 70's.

            "review_text": "Agricultural Simulator: Historical Farming, takes the Agricultural Simulator series of games on a time-traveling trip back to mid 20th century world of Farming. Using vintage equipment, you can create your own workable farm. Agricultural Simulator: Historical Farming also allows you to Co-Op play with a friend, so you can work a farm together. The game basically plays the same way as Agricultural Simulator 2013, but without the newer equipment, which makes it more of a challenge. This particular game does not appear to have a playable tutorial the way Agricultural Simulator 2013 did, but there are places online where you can download a free demo, so I would recommend doing that before purchasing the game so you know exactly what you are getting into before you spend money.  I think as a simulator, this game is no different then other Agricultural Simulators and would probably have been a better DLC to Agri Sim 2013, as opposed to a standalone. In any case, it's not a bad game and should present a decent challenge to fan's of the Agricultural Simulator games.",

Fans of nostalgia and history will be glad to work with original designed machines and to till a field with well known Old-timer Tractors. With the new feature – the dynamic ground Agrar Simulator – Historical Farming presents the first real furrows which will be left when working at the fields with strong machines. The furrows will have impact on the driving behavior of the tractors and guarantee pure realism. It is up to the player to decide in which region he would like to cultivate his farm. There are two amazing scenarios – idyllic highlands, valleys and woods in the alp-region or the fascinating Toscana region with measured climate.",

After watching a Youtube video, it still took me 5 min to figure out how to get the pigs in the stalls. There is a chicken coop, and tons of chickens, but I couldn't figure out how to get the chickens in the coop. I hear cows.... Can't find the cows. After standing next to the tractor for another 5 min. wildly pressing buttons, I finally managed to get on the tractor. Opened store to buy equipment. Game crashed to desktop.  Well, that was a waste of 20min. Even though I only paid 1/8th of $2.19 for this technically.. I still feel ripped off. Graphics are bad.. Controls are bad, The entire interface is needlessly over complicated. Lots of Icons implying that there is stuff you can interact with.. but how? That's the big question.",
