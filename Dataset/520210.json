            "review_text": "I'm giving this a thumbs up solely for the fact that its the first semi-usable desktop client I've been able to find for my GS63VR. Bigscreen is my goto for desktop usage but for mobility purposes I opted for a laptop and have been looking for some way to browse the internet mid-VR sessions without having to take off my Vive. It's absolutely not worth $40 in it's current state but I will come back to it from time to time with the hope that the devs don't just get lazy and abandon it; Because while it's not particularly great or even very good yet, the potential is there and even some minor tweaks would make this a viable option for laptop VR usage.",
