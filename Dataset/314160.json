            "review_text": "I'm a private pilot and I've owned the boxed version of Flight Simulator X for years.  When I upgraded my system to Windows 8.1 I was saddened to see that my old Flight Simulator X started to develop glitches. So when Steam released a new version I was excited. I bought it on day one of it's release.   However, free flight mode wouldn't work. But after emailing DoveTail Games tech support they deteremined that I had a corrupt download. I did a re-download and install and it worked perfectly. The problems were not with the game.   I'm very pleased that the graphics are better than ever. There is over 24,000 airports around the world all with exact runway layouts, taxiways, buildings and scenery around the airports. Plus every major city, tourist attraction, landmark, river, lake, stream around the world has been simulated. Navigation aides operate just like in real life. Flight Simulator was a huge undertaking and it's all at your fingers for just a few bucks. Amazing.  If you plan to get your pilot's license or need a tool to stay sharp (without spending $100+ per hour to rent a plane), then Flight Simulator X is a must have. It's just a no-brainer. Even if you own other flight simulators, you won't find any with all these features.   Microsoft along with other companies spent many years and millions and millions of dollars developing this product. When it was developed it was actually built to take advantage of faster computers that would be available in the future. That's why as time goes by, the game actually gets better.    While I use it as a flight instruction tool, my son uses it like a game. He enjoys the missions and together we go on sight-seeing tours. We've Flown over the pyramids and over the Nile river. We've tooled over Washing DC and viewed the Lincoln Memorial, The Washington Monument and the Whitehouse. You name it we've been there, Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz, Space Needle, etc.   Your kids will learn more about world gerography from this game than from any book. Because it's not just pictures, it's real life simulation. They have to take off froma local airport and actually find landmarks.    After I bought my Steam version of Flight Simulator, I was going to install my boxed 'Accelleration Expansion Pack'. But to my surprise, I found that it already came pre-installed with this Steam set.   AND THE BEST PART... I once paid over $600.00 for a packaged video course on getting a private pilot's license. But FSX comes with built in flying lessons by legendary Certified Flight Instructor Rod Machado. He will teach you how to get not only your private pilot's license, then your instrument rating, then your commercial license, and then how to become an Airline Transport Pilot. That much real life training in a real life flight school would be at least $25,000. But you get it for free with FSX.   Obviously nothing beats learning in a real plane, but this is a close second. And it's all for the price of a pizza.   Since my first purchase I have purchased several copies as gifts for friends and family and would recommend it as either a game or a learning tool for any future private pilots.",

            "review_text": "I'm writing this review, because of some people who said this game sucks, because of the hard controls. So, this is a plane SIMULATOR! Anyone know what's that? S-I-M-U-L-A-T-O-R! Of course it will be hard to learn. The real pilots spend around 1 year of learning in the simulators, before their first real flight. And yeah, don't worry, this is not a fully real simulator.  Let's talk about Boeing 747-400. It has the most basics controls you need, like flaps and throttle, aircraft lights and anti-ice system and many more. I just want to say it's not that so hard like in a real aircraft, where you need an hour of preparation before flight, don't worry. It takes 10 minutes for me to set everything for takeoff. And if you wonder how many hours it takes for me, before landing in extreme conditions for first time - 24 hours. It's hard, trust me, but not impossible.  Another thing: It's not impossible to play without a joystick. As I said you need time for practise. I play with a keyboard and I have 140 hours, as you can see.  It's not that so hard, you need time! Some people who are buying this game are like: 'Oh yeah, I bought a flight simulator. It will be easy to fly.'; And then in the game: 'OMG, this is so stupid game, I can't even takeoff.' Then uninstalls and write a negative review. I don't know why they are buying a simulator and want things to happen fast and easy. As the beginning of the review - this is a SIMULATOR! There are so many games, where to get flying you need to push only one button, like GTA, you know.  UPDATE 28.09.2015: If DTG won't stop with these DLCs, the game itself will turn into the next DLC Simulator 2015 after the disappointment with TS 2016, but I still recommend it.  UPDATE 04.02.2016: Yep..... DTG didn't stop and there it is... over 1400 euros for DLCs.....  IMPORTANT!!!: DTG IF YOU ARE READING THIS THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING YOU DID TO THIS GAME, BUT THESE DLCs ARE COMPLETE MADNESS! WTF! DO YOU REALISE YOU ARE ABOUT TO BREAK ONE CLASSIC GAME? Oh, and you know what? I CAN GET THEM ALL FOR FREE! THERE ARE SO MANY SITES OUT THERE! SERIOUSLY, YOU ARE OUT OF CONTROL! WAKE UP AND STOP DREAMING ABOUT GETTING MORE MONEY! YOU CAN STILL MAKE THIS GAME BETTER, EXEPT TS 2016, WHICH IS ALREADY DEAD SINCE 2012.....",

I have original FSX with Accel and more than £500 worth of add-ons, and I bought this one, to see how is it going to be developed, but it looks like they've gone for fast return of investment only. I have already invested in X-Plane now with some more than decent add-ons, and will be completing my transition by removing this title from steam library at some point if nothing changes. Waste of money so far.  PS: Look at the 'official' reviews, it's like if it was a new title, which it obviously ISN'T. All dovetail did, and as it appears the reviewers are unaware of, is re-released the original FSX re-compiled for current versions of OS, and added few fixes - nothing else.",

Cons:- The sim looks a bit dated (Remember its a 10 year old software and this can be fixed with 3rd party software and texture packs), DLC's can be a bit expensive but sales are always going on on steam so these are a good chance to pick up a good deal.

I especially enjoyed the multiplayer servers, being able to communicate with other players as pilots and ATCs. The multiplayer ran on the GameSpy service, which was taken offline some time ago, taking much of the fun away. I also installed several dozen extra planes from the internet in an effort to increase the variety and replayability of my disc copy. This, however, corrupted the files saved on my computer, and I was unable to reinstall the game from the disc after uninstalling it in an attempt to solve the problem. FSX was no more.  THEN.........  Steam releases Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Steam edition, and I immediately snatch it up on sale for 80% off -- $5 From what I can tell, the Steam edition includes all of the content included in the disc Gold Edition, all bundled together and sold on Steam.  And the best part is, Steam revived the multiplayer, and it now runs off of Steam, instead of GameSpy . Multiplayer is easy to connect to, has integrated steam friends support, and is very stable and quick. The game is almost perfect.  My one non-positive comment about the game would be the fact that it CURRENTLY lacks Steam Workshop support. FSX is a great candidate for addons, as there are relatively few planes included in the official game. There are planes available on the internet for download, but it would be very helpful to have an integrated source on Steam for well-made downloadable aircraft.   Overall I would give this game 9/10.

            "review_text": "I had to wait until I had a substantial in-game time to actually review this fairly. I think I've came to a conclusion.  This is not a game, as anyone who sims would tell you. Sure, there are little missions and things like that that you can play through and complete an objective, however, the core of the simulator is simply that: simulation.  If you're thinking about buying FSX simply to play through and complete the missions, this is not for you. Get a game like 'DCS: World' or 'War Thunder'. But, if you're part of the small niche that enjoys simulating real life flights, planning flights, practicing VFR or IFR, or anything along those lines, get it. Even if you don't know much about aviation in general, but you are willing to learn, FSX is a great place to start.  That being said, FSX isn't flawless. Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition is not an exception to this.  FSX: Steam Edition is simply a way to get into the wonderful world of flight simulation easily over the quick and painless Steam platform. There are very minor improvements behind the scenes, but in terms of content and things like that nothing has really changed from what you can get out of the boxed Flight Simulator X. The only big changes are the fact that 'Out of Memory Errors' seem to barley ever happen. (I've personally only experienced it once, and that was because I didn't tweak much of my game at all.)  But that brings me to the next part of the entire Flight Simulator X experience, whether you're on the boxed version or Steam. FSX needs addons, tweaks, and bugfixes. Stock FSX, simply and quite frankly put, is rudimentary. The flight models of aircrafts aren't nescessarily accurate and scenery isn't beautiful or photorealistic by any means. On top of that, FSX can be heavily improved by turning on the buggy DX10 and using Steve's DX10 fixer, but that's another story.  FSX also needs some tweaking to it's config files to work better on modern hardware. But I'm not going to go into that, there are fantastic guides on the steam page, and internet, that will help you with that.  The jist of what I'm trying to say is that FSX is something that you're either going to fall in love with, or become just another game that sits in your Steam library untouched.  You'd want to expect to buy some nice aircraft. (I personally recommend the 'A2A Cessna 172 Trainer', fantastic attention to detail and flight model.) Those cost money, and while there are freeware aircraft out on the internet, you aren't going to get the level of realism and immersion from big names like A2A or PMDG. Scenery can be easily supplemented with addons like 'Active Sky' or 'Orbx' but even then it costs more money and more time from just simulation. On top of that, you need either a joystick or a yoke and rudder pedals. You're not going to get away for long just using keyboard and mouse. It's just not fun.  So in the end, yes I do reccommend this game. Very much so, actually. But you have to be willing to put forth the time and money it takes to get this game looking and feeling as real as it can.",

For anyone doubting this or trying to decide between X-Plane or Prepar3d, look no fruther. 5 dollars, or even 20, is a way better deal than X-Plane and Prepar3d. Seriously, this game runs so much differnetly now I still can't believe it. Enjoy",

If you want a completely proffesional game you will need to set up vatsim but first you need to know the ins and outs of the plane. FSX is like the tariner sim, atc arent that importatnt right now and you can just go on free flight if you want no trolls and have atc. However in multiplayer you can share your aircraft and if youy have a friend witht he game sharing the aircraft with them is awesome. In my opinion i would buy this game in a sale, when it is around £5 and if you really enjoy it and want a more professional sim, when you are ready download vatsim/vpilot buy a payware plane and maybe some scenery packs. Yes to really make the game amazing youy have to pay but in the end it is worth it.",

I fondly remember spending hours trying to land my Cessna in the original Microsoft Flight Simulator, and the joy I felt when I finally got it right, but I just don't have that sort of time any more.  I am glad to say Flight Simulator X brought that joy back. It is not perfect by any means - the shell is a little unstable, alt-tabbing (on my installation of Windows 7 at least) means kissing your session goodbye, and the scenery is often somewhat lacklustre. But it is accessible, and that counts for a lot.  You get a wide variety of aircraft to play with, the game simulates the /entire world/, and you can choose the skill level that's right for you. FSX ~wants to let you into its tree fort to play, and has very well done tutorial missions to get you up and running. (A lot of simulators forget the importance of good tutorial missions. If the tutorial missions aren't done well, the new user experience is likely to be limited to those missions and the 'Delete all local content' menu option on Steam.)   How far you want to take it is up to you, and you don't have to take it all as one lump - you can, for example, ignore the radio and navigation entirely if you so choose, and concentrate on learning to fly by the seat of your pants. If you want to land on a carrier in oatmeal-thick fog on one engine, FSX will let you do that, too: enough real world pilots seem to play FSX that it doesn't seem likely it's been overly diluted.   FSX is, in other words, easy to learn but hard to master. My advice for newbies is to take the ultralight, tune down the realism settings, and just enjoy flying around the photogenic city of your choice for a while. Land on a scenic landmark or two, watch the AI traffic come in and out, then maybe try a short intercity hop or two.",

It crashed all the time, low frame rates and lets just say it didn't suit my computer as its a very old game. After a while it went completely corrupt on my computer and I gave up all together. Then I bought X-plane 10 when it went on sale. It was alright. Then one day I saw FSX on sale for only £3.99 and thought to myself, hell I enjoyed FSX so much before so why not buy this and if it goes corrupt on me then its only just £3.99. Let me tell you one thing. It was the best decision I had made in a while. It took me about 35mins to download (its a big game around 10gb) and as soon as I put it on I could tell this was made for my computer. I have around 24 hours on it and never has it once crashed on me. The boxed version felt like it was made for a 10 year old computer but Dovetail have done a great job on this and now it works great on Windows 8.1. I even use the PMDG 737ngx on it and no crashes whatsoever. Downloadable content is bs but I don't really care about that not when there's so much 3rd party content out there.   If you are hesitant to buy this after having a bad experience on the boxed version, especially if your on Windows 8/8.1, well be hesitant no more. Hopefully Dovetail will continue to work on this game and make it even better then it is now.",

That includes everything from scenary to cockpit models. I even tried installing a few graphical mods which barely improved the visual experience.  - Flight Models (Having come from DCS, I notice a huge difference in how the aircraft performs.. It feels very arcadey) - Cockpit Fidelity (Half the buttons and switches in the cockpits aren't toggleable)  I realise this is a 2006 game and perhaps I'm expecting too much from it.

No more than $15.00.  2) Don't expect the terrain realism that you've come to expect having used Google Earth and it's flight simulator. For example, just fly to where you live and see how awful Microsoft FSX depicts your neighborhood, if you can even find your neighborhood. Then compare that to Google Earth's flight simulation over your neighhood. Enough said.  Then why do I still recommend it? Because it has good cockpit and flight control realism. You could actually learn how to fly many types of airplanes with Microsoft FSX. Just don't look too closely at the scenery.",

This sim is what my school uses when actual flight isn't ideal, so when it came to steam, and at a reasonable price, I jumped on it. This is great to get a solid idea of how flying a plane actually is. I do have some complaints, though, which are that the controls for rudder/ground steering do not function very well for me. One touch makes a dramatic turn, and are difficult to fine tune. Another complaint is that the game starts having framerate issues when approaching some airports, though I cannot tell if that is my system or the game itself.  I recommend finding information about the planes that you are flying to know exactly what they are doing, as this is a sim. That way you can figure out best climb speed, role speed, best glide and so on, because they will matter in this simulator. It will also help to learn about traffic patterns and other things like that. Otherwise, give it a try and have fun! I do, and I intend to invest in some flight controls for it as well.  Quick tip - for most aircraft, it's throttle for altitude, pitch for speed, something most first-timers might find helpful.",

            "review_text": "Firstly, I'll get the obvious stuff out of the way...  It's from 2006, so graphically it's not great. The UI is typically Microsoft-Fugly. It doesn't have a great deal of charm. It is spectacularly reliant on community contribution, and while there's a lot of extra free content, it's a pain in the neck to install some of it. As in, unzip files into folders and then move them into other folders...  But if you're OK with the base scenery/planes then this isn't going to be a major issue.  Get a joystick or a controller (I use a controller. I'd love a joystick.) with as many buttons and levers as it is humanly possible to acquire, and it would be beneficial to run multiple screens, because, despite the drawbacks...  ... if you want a non-combat flight-sim which doesn't cut corners, you're going to have a hell of a hard-time beating this one... and you may as well have all the kit.  This is a remarkably deep sim, allowing you to take off and fly around much of the world in a staggering variety of aircraft (though you'll have to install a fair few of those yourself if you really want to broaden your horizons)   There are missions to complete if you want to, or free-flight if you don't. If you live in a moderate population centre, you'll likely even find your local airfield is there... though if there's no specific scenery pack for it, you may find - as I did - that the basics are right - such as where the coast is - but the procedurally generated filler will just hazard a guess as to what your city or town actually looks like.  Where the game excels is how it allows you - as a sim enthusiast - to develop your own flight plans and actually FLY the plane from point-A to point-B, in real-time, using real-world weather taken from your local weather station, and with real light conditions based on your actual time of day.  You can do it using all the electronic gadgetry in anything from a modern Air New Zealand SAAB passenger jet, to the visual 'fly by the seat of your pants' Bleriot XI from 1905... assuming you bother to download them. The point is that there are plenty of options.  For those of you who are interested, but are not really familiar with the Microsoft sim range... you don't get to shoot things. There are races and missions and training courses, but no enemies diving in from the sun. There are airports and cities and landmarks, but no AAA or bombing runs. There's a lot of button pushing (some of it quite obscure) and it depends on the aircraft you're using whether there's a virtual cockpit, or a static BMP one, or none at all.  You'll spend a lot of time watching the autopilot tell you how far away from your next waypoint you are... though you may be able to have a chat to other players or the control tower in multi-player games. It's not about the action.  But it REALLY hit the spot for me as far as flight-sims go, and I'm loving finding those rare downloadable aircraft online and flying them around.  Into hard-core simulation games where you have to stretch a braincell or two, and don't mind not being disturbed by incoming missiles? This could be the game for you.  Want to be shot at by baddies? IL-2 is very good.",

They bring the game back! Hooray! But no, not hooray for anyone but Steam. All of the simple fixes to make the game more enjoyable or even playable (logbook.bin, anyone?) did not even get touched. Missions still glitched to hell and back. Some airports still unplayable. Logbook issues, keybinding issues. I could go on but you get the drift here.  This is a money grab by steam. Although it is cheaper than the boxed version, the developers spent minimal time fixing any of the bugs that made the boxed set so damn frustrating. Although it still works, if you are going to slap you name over a product like it is something new and improved, then improve it. Don't rely on us enthusiasts to improve the game for you.
