            "review_text": "Curse of Nordic Cove. What to say about this game? Well alot but I would rather not. You play as Irish McLeatherjacket who is looking for his girlfriend and needs to find some crystals I guess? The plot really isn't very good overall. So anyway you are looking for your girlfriend the only way you know how golfing and fighting off the spirits the infest the course with a couple of different things like golf clubs and a golf ball gun. The combat is pretty ♥♥♥♥ed to be honest the ammo is next to impossible to find for the gun even though you are on a golf course and if you hit a ghost with your club you lose that club so be careful about which club you are swinging with. The voice acting is to be expected, rather mediocre. When you can tell whats actually being said it's very comedic and not always in the good sense. So short but sweet is it worth playing? Uh that's really up to you to decide. If you like akward golfing and combat mechanics then sure this is right up your alley. If you don't then I wouldn't suggest it. However for the low price of 99 cents if you have some spare pocket change it's worth the buy to joke about with your friends. 6/10 Didn't kill me. If you wan't to see gameplay here is a link.         YouTube™ Video:  The Curse Of Nordic Cove&nbsp;",
