This game is decent enough that I played through the campaign, but if you want some classic DF gameplay then go play Arma 2 or 3.",

Not worth 15$, I got shot from over 300 Meters away with an AK in the leg, and it killed me instantly, the ballistics are non-existant, and is just not a good overall game, unless you like hardcore games that are arcade shooters, then buy it.",
