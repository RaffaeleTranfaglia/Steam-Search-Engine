            "review_text": "At least it CAN be finished...  I've played some clickers up to this moment, and I can admit, Tap Tap Infinity is not the most original, or breath-catching of them. In fact, I even agree with the point that it looks so much like 'Cliker Heroes' title. Only better.  Let's just say about clickers in general: they are little games with tendency to keep on going, like, forever. The good side of those games, as I see it, is that you can leave the clicker game going, and even close the game window, and yet it will be playing - for you. All clicker games are about numbers - you starting with 1 coin, then, after 1 hour, you're operating millions, then you learning about googoles... and bigger numbers. At some point, I bet, the Graham number can be achieved through some clicker game...  So! As I thought when first started some clickers, the process is easy enough - you start the game, making first moves (clicks), and then you go to your business, and the game running itself forward, making some achievements with numbers on its way. Funny thing, but only Tap Tap Infinity was good enough in that. All other clickers after some point getting more and more deserving for your time, to the point where you'll be mindlessly clicking the mouse all day long. All - but not Tap Tap Infinity! Yeah, despite the name. Getting controversial here... With some latest addons, it become one of the most fanciest clickers I've met. It is more stable, and more fair than 'Clicker Heroes', where you just can't beat the latest levels normally. All big numbers are messed up in your precious 'Clicker Heroes', dear fans, and I really can't even feel sorrow for you, if you still climbing to the upper levels, but not able to achieve them!  Okay, let's summarise: Tap Tap Infinity is your standard clicker game, one of those which I actually can recommend to play if you're wandering what's it is all about. Although if you want all 100 achievements, be prepared to spend dozens of hours on that (I was playing offline mostly, so don't think it is as fast as 14 hours to beat the game). And, besides time, which is still more precious than all those clicker games, to start with... If you still want to try a piece, don't play it with your best mouse (the one which is worth more than 10$). Clicker games are made for killing touchscreens and mouses, keep that in mind.  My mark will be 6/10. Almost a normal game, and free-ware! But really, better play something more mind-catching.",

            "review_text": " TL;DR: Grindy but truly casual clicker game for those who want to play while they play.    Tap Tap Infinity  is a casual idle/clicker game, very similar to a certain other Steam game,  Clicker Heroes  (CH). Now why would a gamer like me with several thousand games (some of which might actually be good) waste time to play this? For achievements of course.  Now that my lousy motivation is out of the way, let's get dirty with the details. Being a clicker game the gameplay itself isn't very complex. A monster appears on the screen. Clicking it will damage it. Once it gets enough damage it dies and bleeds gold, with which you can buy upgrades and train your heroes to be able to beat higher, more difficult monster waves.   A game with a story",

You unlock your spells by ranking up and you can also upgrade them, like same as you can upgrade your Heroes Skills. Great game, that you can play hundred hours and you still have something to improve. Also I love Mystery Gifts, which you drops really often and you can win Ranks, golds or Infinity Tokens. - Great game for a lot of time. I hope, developers will add more heroes (After 500 level or something like that) and will keep updating this game with more locations, monsters and spells. - You can also play it on Phones !",

I still don´t recomment such 'idle-games' because all of them are boring. The diffrences from this game to clickerheroes are unimportant, because new features like story (the story is bad and you need to click it away so it feel more like crap) or max buy (who cares it with autoclicker?!) and all the other new features make it not a new game. I don´t know how to have fun with such 'games' so... if you have fun with other idlegames play this but the diffrences between this and clickerheroes are unimportant as i said. And don´t be so stupid like other guys and use your mouse for clicking like an idiot. Use an autoclicker that click for you because this games are designed for it and it´s not worth to bring your mouse and your fingers/hand to the limit (tenosynovitis isn´t funny!!!).  If you think like me that this 'games' are a !!!BIG PIECE OF BULL...äh...CRAP!!! then go and play real games from your libary.  Btw. the reason to write such reviews is that this 'games' are terrible overrated. To avoid it is like to assist the system to scam peoples money with microtransactions.",

A game which is exactly like clicker heroes, save some differences but not enough of them to make me feel like it's something fresh and new, but more like ah, I have done this before, boss at every fifth?, hp instead of timers but the same deal (this is not fresh), and so I played and hoped for something new but no, gold, chests, heroes, hero abilities, % , 'spells' and of the few I got is basicly the same as the ones in clicker heroes.  although the graphics are in 3d and the bosses are your future heroes, with including text boxes everywhere trying to create a story by making you clicking to get the story to move on (which halts gameplay), ofc it's all according to your taste. I choose CH because that's the one I begun with, and I hate the blantant ripping I have seen in TTI I must admit. someone should just come up with a new formula instead.",

However in this case, you click RPG style enemies to attack them, earn currency and use this currency to enslave (or as the game puts it, hire) the bosses that you murder and spend more money on leveling up those slaves and making them more efficient at killing future slaves. You can even go back and kill the bosses you've already enslaved! Trust me, it's actually really simple.  The art style is very cartoon-like and it is technically 3D. The enemy models are simple, but they still look really nice and slick. The game runs smoothly, without any frame drops and all the animations are also smooth and well made.  If you liked cookie clicker, and like RPG's you will LOVE this game. Even if you don't like cookie clicker, give this game a shot, because it's free and takes 30 seconds to download.

Upgrades are there, but like all of these idle games they're either going to take you weeks to get anywhere significant, or you're going to end up paying for them. I can't even call this a 'pay to win' model because you never actually win. The game goes on forever. So this and most other idle games become a test of your patience. Are you willing to wait several hours or several days for that next tantalizing upgrade, or will the game convince you to spend your hard-earned cash?  I suppose it's good enough to kill a random few minutes here and there, so long as you don't get too invested in it. That said, there's really not much in the way of gameplay. You click things. You're never in any danger and there's no real risk. You just sit there and click things. All of these games eventually get boring because you're just rehashing the same thing over and over again.
