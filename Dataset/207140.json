Simple, easy, and extremely fun (With friends, ten times that). 2. Soundtrack is amazeballs. 3. Progressively challenging. 4. Wide variety of funky characters to choose from. 5. Brilliant level designs.    Cons  :  1. Minimal amount of players during matchmaking. 2. Lack of advertising for the game. Not many people buy it. Please, buy it.  It may not look visually appealing, or promising, but that's what even I thought before I actually went ahead and bought it. This is a  must-buy  for those who love party-oriented games.",

SpeedRunners is a multiplayer racing game with up to four players where you choose and unlock all sorts of comical characters to play as. Racing on foot has never been this fun. Wait, it's never been fun... Well, this Makes it fun! You can play this game both casually with friends, and competitively with anyone. Learning the physics of this game and it's crazy tricks raises the skill ceiling so much higher! You can play ranked with people of your skill level, or jump into a quick match and have just as much fun grappling and kicking off walls to your leisure. There's even a single player story mode, with unlockable comic book chapters! Not to mention, this game's soundtrack and art style makes it feel all the more like you're inside a comic book! While many players buy this game on sale and give up early, this game is most definitely not dead, and seeing its success and competitive scene, won't ever die. This game is simple fun for absolutely anyone! Grapple far and hit slopes hard, runners! This game is amazing, and I'd recommend it for anyone who likes any sort of platformer game!",

            "review_text": "A good concept with decent game play. I don't think it's worth it's stated price but it's still in early access. Time will only tell! My hope is that they add some mini-game functions or attempt to play with the rules of the game. (This game is local co-op)!  Speed Runners is a game about running the fastest, being first while leaving your enemies in the dust. By being last, you risk the chance of being eliminated by being off the edge of the screen. The  gameplay  itself for the moment is decently good but has a lot -First player controls the pace and controls the camera. Take the long route or risk grabbing a pick-up may cost you a life. The scoring system as of current requires three wins. This means you need to win three times in order to take the game. You do not need to win consecutively to win the game. There are about a handful of characters to choose from at the moment. Some characters are available to unlock while others are DLC's. All character designs are quite unique and all move differently from one another. I haven't noticed any significant diversity in speed between the characters.   More or less, all characters seem to jump just as high as one another and move as fast as one another. Is this a good thing? Depends. It offers a level playing field for everyone but mixing up the game is never a bad idea. One person may prefer speed while another may prefer brawn. The only issue I have so far is that players are not able to melee or hit one another without a power up. Sure, this may be good as people aren't whacking one another always but some players I have played with mentioned that a melee addition would make it more engaging. Nonetheless, the game is still enjoyable and power ups provide a great addition to the game. Some of the power ups included are a grappling hook to grab the nearest opponent that pulls them back and you forward, boxes that opponents can run into, a force ball that completely slows and pushes opponents and a homing rocket missile (just to name a few).   Levels themselves are quite challenging and take a bit of time to get used to and really good at. It is a bit overwhelming at first playing online and getting completely smoked by veteran players. If one's really persistent on getting good, it does take a little grinding to familiarize yourself with the level design.  Visuals  are quite simple and suit the games needs. It's not over the edge 3D but the graphics do fit the atmosphere. I wouldn't mind seeing a little more done in regards to animations or things happening in the background. Heck, why not have players influence some of the backgrounds/graphics. Why not even have them alter the stage? This is possible to a certain extent as levers are present throughout levels. These levers open and close paths and definitely add some more interest to the game.  Sounds  are pretty decent at this point and aren't extremely varied character to character. Dialogue is slightly different but wouldn't hurt to add a few more sounds to the voices.   Overall, not a bad game in it's current form. There is a lot of opportunity here to take the game beyond being a simple linear running game. Although be it so, there's some serious fun to have online or between your buddies. I'm really, really, really hoping they add some mini-games or some more diversity into the game. They got a nice engine, let's do more with it!  Indie Rating : 7.6/10  EARLY ACCESS RATING : 6.95/10       Gameplay   C+     Story / Campaign   N/A     Visuals / User Interface   B-     Sounds / Music   C+     Replay-ability   B-     Overall    C+      PS - Why can't you take in-game screenshots with F12?",

I first purchased SpeedRunners as a sort of replacement for Runbow. I didn't want to have to plug my Wii in all the time to just play one game. Why not just buy a new running game, and let my litle black box gather more dust and grow more and more redundant in peace?  The game is hectic. Chaotic. Deliightfully retro. There were many times I was mere milliseconds away from an untimely elimination, only to boost and swing just right and propel myself to a dashing finish. Oher times I was not so lucky, and was left groaning in annoyance and even frustration. I can only imagine how that would look with three other people playing on the couch, too. Probably a party.  Long story short: buy it. It's a good time, even on your own. It only gets better from there.",

That's not the reason I decided to post a positive review though. The mechanics and gameplay are very fun, but because it's (pretty much) multiplayer only, it's the players that make or break it for me. And the community is actually pretty cool for the most part. Firstly, the ranking system is ♥♥♥♥ed and everybody knows it. That's a point against the game. But the community makes up for it by understanding when players aren't as skilled as them and oftentimes encouraging them or even giving them a helpful hand in figuring out how to become speedy.   So in conclusion, great game, awesome community. Game is definately worth it.",

A controller helps and not thinking too hard, just go with the momentum and you'll somehow get through all the F**King wall climbs and F**King boxes.   But you'll  WANT  too. You'll  NEED  too. It's addictive and fast and relatively simple to pick up. I like the way the 'story' is told in the cartoons, but I wish the text-dialogue was more than just hints on how to play. It's coloured brightly (but not eyeball-searingly) and the slick little animations make it super entertaining to watch. I am hooked. Not grappled, though.
