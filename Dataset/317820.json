            "review_text": "GoD is a fun little rogue-like with a lot of character, but not a lot of content.  The card based gameplay is very straight forward compared to a traditional TCG, so the mechanics shouldn't be a stumbling block for most players for very long. Each of the different character classes (13 in total, I believe) has their own starting decks. These decks are expanded in battle by collecting equipment dropped after each battle. As with most RPGs, the common drops are low quality, only granting you a single card or buff, while the rare and epic loot drops can grant you 5 powerful cards and multiple buffs. You can also equip your Dungeoneer with a special item or blessing before exploring a dungeon, and these can offer advantages like extra hit points, larger starting hand sizes, or increased damage.  Your role in the game is not that of the Dungeoneer! You are actually the guildmaster sending these freshly recruited dungeon crawlers in to fetch you treasure, to defeat boss monsters to give you bragging rights over a more successful rival guild, and more often than not, to die.  This is where a lot of people are complaining about the game. Instead of this being a traditional RPG when you play as the same protagonist throughout, leveling up and accumlating new powers, your Dungeoneers die quite frequently and are replaced just as easily. There is no individual character progression in the game... Only the Guild benefits from the adventurers labors. You may find yourself getting attached to a particular Guildie after they survive a few expeditions, but trust me...  THEY ARE ALL EXPENDABLE.  Once you have that in mind, you will find a fun and stylish game! The maps are partially laid out for you, and you get to fill in the blanks with the random dungeon tiles you are given each turn. Same thing with treasure and enemy placement. Some things are already on the map for that particular mission, and you get to place the rest to your own liking. You don't directly control the Dungeoneer once they are on a mission, but you can influence their path by tempting them with gold or putting a monster in their path. GoD actually reminds me of the tabletop tile game Boss Monster, and that is a favorable comparison!  The biggest downside of the game is that it is very short. I beat the game with nearly 100% unlocked in a little over 15 hours. There is no end game content, and you cannot re-run old missions in the same game. There is no New Game +. The selection of classes and items is limited. There is little replay value. As such, the game does kind of let you down because there is the potential for so much more!  Apparently an expansion entitled Pirates Cove is in the works, so that is a plus. The ability to mod the game would bea welcome addition. I, for one, would love to create some of my own classes or even do different genres, like a Warhammer 40K-style sci-fi version or super hero style set up.  If you don't mind the relatively small amount of content, then yes, I recommend this game. Just be aware that you're going to be paying about a dollar per hour of content. Fun content, yes!   Just not a lot of it...",

The graphics are simple, but have a lot of personality in them in that they look hand drawn. The gameplay is simple, but can be very fun. Overall, it's a game where most design decisions are something that you'll either like or you won't, and neither disposition is particularly uncommon.",

The visual style is simple yet effective, the classes play sufficiently differently for people to find their preferred playstyle, and of course the chuckleworthy soundtrack is the star.  The card-based gameplay may be a little too random for some people - sometimes a dungeon run would be literally impossible because I just didn't draw the corridor cards I needed to reach the objective before the turn limit expired - but if that's not a concern to you, then I'd heartily recommend joining the Guild of Dungeoneering.  The Pirates Cove DLC adds some new cards and is fun, but not essential.",

            "review_text": "I am giving this game a 4/5  I feel overall the game is very well made. The graphics have a very classic charm to me and bring me back to a younger age playing table top dungeons that friends and I created.  The random nature of the fights and card drop for creating/moving through the dungeon give it a lot of replay value as you are unlikely to recreate what you did last play through. The guild expansion system gives you a lot of options to strategically move through the game, and feels rewarding as you unlock new classes and items.  There are some areas I feel the game could use some tweaking, but as I'm writing this review shortly after launch I'm sure that things will change.  Here are what I feel are some Pros and Cons  Pro: - Great gameplay with a lot of replay - Charming graphics - Very forgiving learning curve - Item skill distribution gives a lot of customization - Unique class abilities/cards allow for more options in gameplay - Guild expansion gives you ability to play your way - Skill based gameplay matters in the random environment - Great music  Con: - Difficulty scaling between the first area and the jungle. fairly big jump. - Class skills need tweaking to balance - Needs more clarity on some mechanics",

Guild of Dungeoneering is a category of its own, its not really roguelike and its not really a dungeon crawler, but it is fun. - The game has a steep learning curve and you will die, but feel good when you finally beat the boss - You dont build decks, the deck builds your character  - LUCK is a big factor in both your card draws and your dungeon architecture - Different classes allow you to build a strategy for each class, some are not viable - Character dialogue sucks but story narrative is very well done - The combat is good  - Not much replayability, two times is enough to see and do everything  This game will last ~15-20 hours, fun enough to keep you entertained for the whole time depending on luck/skill and how frustrated you get when things dont go in your favor. The art style is very clean and there is enough variation in-game to justify the price.",

            "review_text": "My new favourite little casual roguelike to play between bigger/longer games. Very addictive gameplay with lots of versatility. The versatility comes with a large castle/base to build on and upgrade which opens up a ton of equipment options. There's also different classes with their own traits. The cards you play during combat are modified by the class and also the combination of equipment you have that you gain by exploring.   I'd say it's priced fairly. 10 would be a bargain and 20 too much. The graphics are crisp and clean. The artstyle suits the whimsical style of the game and voice overs.   No bugs or issues so far. I had one initially where the game did not load into fullscreen but I think that was because I launched it directly from the steam install window. After restarting the game, it's never come up again.  There are no video options but I don't think you need them? It's cards moving rather than animations so there's really nothing to affect by playing with video options. Game is capped at 30 fps, which again, it's cards moving, not animations so there's no actual benefit to 60. I'd rather have it capped at 30 than see frame variance if I'm playing windowed, which I do because of the casual nature of the game, since it's much more jarring. Plus, I'd rather have it at 30 and see this come out sooner on mobile platforms. Just a heads up if you're one of those people that needs big options and customzation menus because it's a game on a PC despite it being a small casual game. The only thing missing is a hard option button for fullscreen/windowed that could even be a toggle on the main menu. I just use keyboard shortcuts because they're quicker and easier.  I don't think you can go wrong with $15 for this if you like the casual or roguelike genres.",

            "review_text": "Reminds me a bit of Card Hunter which is one of my favorite games though that one is all about amassing huge piles of loot and here you lose everything after each run, successful or not. My only gripe is that the lower tier adventurer classes get totally obsolete by the end. You need to use the tier 3 classes in the tier 3 dungeons or you just die in first fight.   Other than that I enjoyed every minute of it, even when I was getting my ♥♥♥ kicked. Balance is great (difficult but everything is doable as long as you don't mind filling your graveyard) and at 12 hours to beat (for me) it was the perfect length. Music was surprisingly good but the bard got old after a while. Since he can muted separately in the options that wasn't a big deal.  Thumbs up.",

The 'drawn' art style goes wonderfully with the bard voice over, and the playful style and theme of the classes and cards.  The combat is very simple to learn, but has enough depth to it to keep you interested and strategising. The animations for the card-based combat ensure that you know where everything is coming from and what is causing what effect. I was surprised when I watched some video reviews of the game on its release where the combat didn't have any animations, but thankfully that is no longer the case, since they add so much to the clarity of the game.  The out-of-combat gameplay is also surprisingly deep and strategic, with smart enemy placement giving you buffs: for example a bandit who has the 'loner' special gets -1 hp if you place him in a dead end. However, as you reach the final levels in the game you really have to know your way around the game, using every special to best effect.  I have some minor concerns about late game balance and a few classes under/over performing, as well as the progression of gold, but these are pretty minor as far as the whole game goes.  Overall, a great game that's a welcome change of pace. Just enough tactical depth to get those gears turning in your mind, without requiring a huge ton of memorization or learning before you can get into it.",

            "review_text": "After completing this game I can safely say I liked it. The premise of building the dungeons your heroes scour was an instant draw for me; simple controls too, only a mouse is required. It has a good variety of randomly aquired equipment, monster and terrain cards all drawn in a childish manner that you will rapidly warm up to.  While the game is good overall it does have some issues that plague it, the first and most obvious being unable to access the options from the main menu screen. When you start the game you're given a brief tutorial that teaches you the basics but does little to teach you about advanced battle tactics. Sometimes during a quest the game crashes causing you to lose all your progress on that level, which can be be very disappointing when you're doing well. Another thing that was disappointing was discovering that you could not go back to previous levels, I was hoping to go back to the old levels to measure my progress against quests and bosses already beaten.  The DLC added many more quests that enabled you to fight new monsters, collect new equipment and recruit new dungeoneers. Unfortunately the pirate quests are easier than most of the main game quests. The new enemies are very interesting to fight though and there were a few times I had to get tactical with my way of thinking. The new dungeoneers while interesting in their own right, seemed a little too gimmick like and had no substance to them; against the trials of the third act they were especially outclassed. Only one song was added from the the DLC, but like the rest of the track it is high quality and creates much atmosphere. The narration from the bard was well voiced and at times seemed exceptionally annoying, which seems like it was its every intent; however the miniscule options menu does little to help players enjoy either the voice acting or the music in any particular way as there is only a master volume slider and music volume slider.  Once the game is completed you get a giant heap of money that allows you to purchase the rest of the facilities, though this is more a formality as you can't redo quests to test the new dungeoneers which highlights the glaring issue of little replayability. Since the gameplay is relatively simple, playing as different heroes sometimes feels similar with only the synergy between character traits and a characters base card set to freshen things up. All in all, I enjoyed this game and would recommend it as a good, if slightly annoying time waster.",

It kind of reminds me of the games I used to make up as a kid, before I could afford the D&amp;D books, however this one is the real deal. While it is an adult game, it is also a game that kids can play too.   It's not expensive, it is fun and interesting to play and pleasant to the eyes as well. I give it a big thumbs up.

I find myself continuing to play to find out what happens next, and what else there is to discover. I was only going to play a hour or so, but ended up easily playing 3.  If there is a major con to this game, it's the fact that there are too few upgrades to your guild.

            "review_text": "TL;DR: The art and writing is awesome and really unique. The game kind of reminds me of Munchkin. If youve ever played that game and liked it, you'll like this.   Long story short. Build your guild by getting gold. Adventure to get gold by building the dungeon using cards. Attack enemies with different attacks using cards. Get inventory to give you different cards in your attack deck. But that explanation really really doesnt do this game justice.  ____________________________________________________________  I saw this game and when I saw 'card game', I ignored it for a while. But then I got bored and the pickings on Steam had been slim lately. I decided to pick it up.  Its a 'card game' in the same way Hand of Fate is a 'card game'. Meaning yes, its a game, and yes there are cards. But just saying its a 'card game' doesnt do it justice.   For starters, let me just say the game is really unique and stands out among your typical indie fare. Seems like a lot of indie coming out nowdays are kind of spins on the same thing. Granted, even the 15th voxel built (or 2d pixel) open world crafting game or the 53rd RPGMaker SNES JRPG even comes *close* to the 'same $59.99 game, different skin' run of the mill churn of the AAAs, but still.  Like dont get me wrong, I love certain indie genres, pixel art, etc. I'm not knocking indie games, thank whatever deity you want they exist at all.  But its refreshing to see a game that looks and feels like nothing else. Its got great tongue-in-cheek sarcastic writing and narrator and the art has this great 'someones telling a story by doing pencil drawings on pieces of paper' feel.  Gameplay basics: So you start. You have a card, put it down and youve got a barracks. A little adventurer shows up. Now, you can expand your guild (which takes gold) or go adventuring. Since you have no gold, you adventure. You get a hand of cards. Some are treasure cards, enemy cards, or room cards. Your little adventurer is standing there, maybe theres some half built rooms nearby. YOu need to get him/her some gold and loot. You can play 3 cards a turn. Put down a room and that square gets drawn in with the room featurs. Drop an enemy and some treasure. Now send your adventurer in there.  You get a hand of cards with various attacks and defenses (physical/magic). Some cards have specials, such as heal HP, force opponentr to discard etc. So does your enemy. You play them against each other until one of you is dead. Death is permanent for that adventurer, so be careful. If theres treasure, you may get inventory cards (aka loot). Grab what you want, loot the room, and the next turn happens. Play your cards (or dont if you dont want to), move, fight, loot. Keep doing this until you beat the quest goal, whatever that may be. Take the gold you earned back and pick new stuff for your guild, weather its for fighteres, thieves or mages. Put down rooms and items to attract stonger adventurers and boost their stats and abilities.   So far, its fun. Simple enough to pick up and play, but strangely addictive. The combat is the one weak point, its just a matter of back and forth, hoping you get the last hit in first. I'm hoping as I get better guyys it wuill become more interesting, because right nowm its 'I do 1 HP (you have around 5 total), he does 1 HP, I do 1, he does 1, and so forth.

Anyways the game itself is rather entertaining, an original concept, great soundtrack, charming and quirky art style and overall a worthy purchase..........gameplay-wise. However there is a problemthat could and has turned people away.  Video settings...........non-existent and for some reason the fullscreen mode on my computer (probably just my luck) is still in a window, which concidentally doesnt completely fit the screen. Additionally said window has about one 3rd of the window as a large balck chunk. The buttons along the bottom of the hud are almost inaccessible for me. On top of that the games buttons seem to take a rather long time to actually register that you have clicked them. This is not due to my computer lagging it runs most games modern games at a fairly good frame rate and considering this seems very much like a flash game I highly doubt it would push my computer to brink of graphical limits. Overall if you enjoy little time wasters or games that you could potentially sink hours into then I would recommend this game...............in the next few months once it has been updated to edit video options and perhaps a better with regards to buttons.",

            "review_text": "I ought to say that my first impressions on this game are great!!!!!.  For more detailed stuff, just read on! XD  - Pros The game itself is based on simple rules.  Its very intuitive. Uses a lot of strategy. There arent many death penalties.  Its REALLY fun. Its challenging.   - Cons This game, (the way I saw it anyway) depends a LOT on luck.  Even though the graphics are fun ans really suit the game, They should improve it a bit.   8/10   ---DETAILS---  This is a card-strategy game with elements of RPG, delver and dungeon building. The story is prety fun so far and the characters are funny, they actually made me giggle a few times.    Lets split it a bit.  Soundtrack: Simply awesome. Everytime a hero dies, wins a dungeon or when you start the game, the music just blows my mind. It really fits the atmosphere of the game! Congratulations to the developers! 10/10  Graphics: Pretty cool, but not awesome. Its kinda of repetitive, even though whenever you equip a new equipment to a hero it changes the display, everything else stays the same. 8/10  Gameplay: The gameplay consists on 3 parts:  1. Building your guild. The gold you get from dungeons you use to upgrade your guild, allowing you to get more heroes, blessings, different loot in dungeons. You can also check your graveyard and trophy room. Nice features, good mechanics to upgrade, but the visual effects and the higher tier upgrades cost are kinda of lame. 9/10  2. Building the dungeon. At the beggining of the 'round' you receive 5 cards. There are creatures cards, dungeos area cards and treasure cards. You can put 3 of them into play. The idea is to use these 3 cards to build the dungeon, place enemies and treasures for you hero to find. The cards you get are mostly based on luck. Wich SUCKS. Sometimes you only get stupid cards, like 3 areas that only connect to 1 area and 2 creatures that can kick your ♥♥♥ as encounters. I got to say that dependiong entirely on luck kinda bummed me out. 7/10.  3. Movement of the hero and battles. You dont control the hero movement, he ALWAYS take the shortest route to complete the dungeon objective. Easy to understand. The harder the dungeon, the longer the dungeon you must create for him to get there, but the cards you receive to create the dungeon are random, remember? This can SUCK sometimes. Ok, now for the battle system. Its a card battle system. Each of your heroes start with a deck of cards that is the standard for that 'class'. You CANNOT change the deck before the dungeon. It's ALWAYS the same. When you win a battle, you will get some sort of equipment. The equipments will then add cards/give more health to your character. All the equipment is lost once you complete/fail a dungeon. So you always start with the same deck. The battle themselves are fun, but sometimes EXTREMELY frustrating.  You start the battle with 3 cards and you can see the card that you enemy is going to play, with that you can choose the best card for the ocasion. The battles are in 'real time' by that I mean that its not turn based. When you chose your card, yours and the enemies card are used at the same time, unless you use a quick card, wich makes you use it first. Once again, everything is based on luck, but that is to be expected, since its a card based battle, but it kinda takes a bit of the charm of the game. Since it is luck based you can be defeated by some stupid monsters, that you placed and was sure that was going to defeat it. 8/10  Gamplay overall: 24/30  ",

If you don't mind trying to bend RNG over to make it do what you want, it's all good. Just know often times you'll lose because RNGesus has forsaken you.  Something important to note, equipment gives you bonuses such as Arcane 1. It stacks with other Arcane bonuses to give you new cards. Example: head piece and weapon both give you Arcane 1, you'll have Arcane 1 and 2 spells.  Next, get blessings!!!! You'll notice in the expand guild menu 3 boxes with 4 options. Box on the right is for equipment. Box 1 and 2 both have 2 classes and 2 blessings. My advise is to get the class you like then the blessing to add more hp for the first 2 fights. It'll make your start more bearable.  Last, you can play up to 3 cards per turn. Doesn't mean you have to play any. Also you can hover over the enemy names to know what kind of enemy you're placing. Don't want to place an enemy with Leader (for every monster near it the monster gains +1 hp) in the middle of a bunch of monsters.  Gameplay: Turn based combat system using cards. Building a dungeon using cards. Not sure what else I could say honestly.  Music: This is the guild of dungeoneering... Main menu music is stuck in my head. And I LOVE IT!  Art: There's pictures, It's honestly a simple thing of you like or you don't. I like it.  My main problem is the end. After you finish all the dungeons it becomes a file save of an award room basically. Outside of that I enjoy it. And the developers seem to want to add more content for the end.

You'll often find yourself thinking up strategies and mixing up class/item combinations to adapt to different obstacles.  This game is not without flaws. A few glitches here and there need to be patched out, but nothing gamebreaking as far as I have encountered. There is some amount of RNG factor involved, like any other card game, so if you're the sort of person who dislikes somewhat luck-based games, I wouldn't recommend this game for you. The game is somewhat shallow and repetitive; you will fight many enemies over and over again using the same attacks and abilities over and over again.

Combat is pretty simple and so highly predictive. Barring extreme good or bad luck you can be pretty certain of victory or death on turn 1 of combat.  The biggest problem I have with the game is the lack of any persistence between dungeons. You always start as a level 1 hero with no gear. I know the developers have said that the is an intentional part of the gameplay to prevent farming a dungeon to get a super hero, and their reasoning is sound for the game that it is. However, in my view, it is still a design flaw and they should have made other adjustments during design to account for this. It is a major negative to the game. The developers have said that the point of the game is to level up your guild, but this is not a very satisfying experience and feels lacking of consequence.  I've marked the game as a 'no'; however, I will say this. It plays a lot like a board game. If you're looking for a board game this might be the game for you.

After finishing the first two Dungeons, i couldn't pass anymore for the sure luck of the card draw and having no idea what Pros and Cons each Dungeoneer had. It tells you nothing about the Dungeon before you go into it so it slowly becomes 'Oh, i have a magic user in a dungeon that everyone does physical damage and i cant block any of it, guess this was pointless.' I really wanted to enjoy this game, i bought it after watching some people play it, and its not the game i was expecting it was going to be.",

            "review_text": "It's a compelling game and it consumed a lot of my time really quickly without me noticing it. This much is true. However what can't be ignored is the huge, glaring issues saying 'DO NOT TOUCH ME': - Crashes frequently (every 3 hours or so of nonstop play causes a crash) - Consumes an insane amount of memory (2GB of RAM usage is simply not acceptable for a 2D card game period) and has severe FPS issues because of it, even on a machine with 16GB RAM - NO fullscreen controls, locked to 1080p maximum. - Annoying bard who can't be muted, unless of course you like playing without music - Frequently reused stages - Prepare to die a lot, because you can't control your player's movement, which breaks boss battles on the first turn - Speaking of boss battles, they're massive difficulty spikes and generally a big pain in the ♥♥♥ - Only one character type is viable for the majority of the game (Bruiser -&gt; Ranger -&gt; Troubador), and the Mime class is a complete troll/waste of money. Once you get to Alchemist the magic types get decent but they're still badly underpowered compared to the melee ones. - No way to sell previously-bought upgrades to your guild, I've had to restart my playthrough at least once in order to maximize efficiency. - Gameplay gets repetitive quickly  While it's fun, I wouldn't spend $15 on it like I did, not without some serious changes.",

You get random dungeon cards that you don't want and your player is so dumb he just goes where he wants to go. For example: I wanted my player to go walk towards the rat king and instead he's like I think I'm lost and wanders around and gets himself killed by a gnoll. Overall this is just a bad game. Don't touch this garbage. And it's okay if you don't agree with what I'm saying but it's just what I think about this poorly made trash. 4/10",

            "review_text": "Guild of Dungeoneering is a game that rewards progress without giving the player reliable means to do so.  The game is a dungeon-crawling, deck-building, rogue-like RPG, but a character's progression is limited to the start of a map to the end of it. After winning or losing, you lose all of your items, your levels, and any sort of progress, bringing along a small amount of gold back to base to unlock more characters to do the same.  There are a few presistent elements for sure, like temporary buffs at the start of the map or items you can unlock to appear in dungeons, but this was done better by Rogue Legacy, whereas Guild of Dungeoneering still demands that you start in a rather poor and dismal state.  While I enjoyed the game a little at the start, it became clear that as time went on, progress was going come to a grinding halt. I have not played the game in weeks, and I regret not applying for a refund as a result.",

            "review_text": "After about 10 hours of Guild of Dungeoneering, I feel like the lovely interface, cute text, great graphics are ultimately wasted on poor gameplay. The structure of the guild hall itself - the layout - doesn't matter, for example. Dungeons are non-persistant, characters do not develop and are nothing to lose when they die, and characters don't seem to team together for dungeons. Combat is a clever, elegant card game but it ultimately is too simple in terms of dyanamics and does not retain interest. Some strategy is needed to select treasures, monsters, and classes in any given dungeon - but that's about it, and the 'technology tree' isn't deep.   Now, the tech tree and so on could all be expanded and improved; but balance is difficult as systems expand. It would be much more challenging to make many features ultimately 'matter' to the game, and the player. If they do this and give the 2.0 and 3.0 to the current game owners, I would need to revisit the review.   ",
