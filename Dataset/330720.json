As commander, it is your task to provide the battle plan orders to your units. You need to know your mission objectives, strength and weakness of both your forces and you enemy, lay of the land, weather, and time of day in order...",

            "review_text": " ENG:  Flashpoint Campaigns: Red Storm is one of those unique games which I keep in my favorites and would play it anytime along with Combat Mission series, The Operational Art of War III, Command: Modern Air/Naval Operations and AGEod games.   FC:RS is a mix of TOAW III and Combat Mission series set in 80'th Cold War era where it became(in-game) not so cold. Game features lot of interesting staff: Along with military units and formations, game features hybrid asynchronous WEGO system(OODA Loop), which is based on your side capability to give orders - it results in situation where player one for example can give orders each 10 minutes, but second one can do this every 30 minutes and using this timing player one can get inside opponents loop and react almost in time on any change on battlefield. This is not random and its based on lot of factors - Electronic Warfare in the area, available HQ units, C3 lines between subordinate units and their commanders and etc.  Scenarios scale varies from company to brigade scale operations on map sized 20x20 kilometrs divided by ~500 meters hexes. FC:RS modeled lot of cold war advanced weapon systems including US M1 Abrams, Bradley IFVs, UK Chieftan, Warrior IFV along with Soviet T-80s and Hinds. Game also features artillery weapons like mortars and SP Guns with diffirent munition like HE, Smoke, minlets and ICBM, chemical and even nuclear arms.  Really worth to say that developers are working hard on game, for example Players Edition which is currently available on Steam is a result of great work between Developer team and community. Even today game continue to become better and better.  Hope this short list will help you to decide if this game worth your moneys.   RUS:  Flashpoint Campaigns: Red Storm это одна из тех уникальных игр, в которые я играю почти всегда, рядом с играми серии Combat Mission, The Operational Art of War III, Command: Modern Air/Naval Operations и играми AGEod.   FC:RS это микс между TOAW III и Combat Mission в сеттинге холодной войны, как раз в тот момент, когда она переста(в игре) быть такой уж холодной.  Игра имеет много интересных реализаций, например наряду с огромным кол-вом военной техники игра предлагает интерсный гибридный режим WEGO(OODA Loop) тайминг ходов в котором основан на возможности стороны отдавать приказы - в результате этого бывают ситуации, когда одна сторона может отдавать приказы каждые 10 минут, а вторая каждые 20, тем самым время реакции первой стороны на ситуацию заметно меньше второй, что в свою очередь ведет, при правильном применении, к своевременной реакции на изменения на поле боя и к победе. Циклы командования не рандомны, а основаны на многих факторах, включая РЭБ, доступность штабов, существование линии командования между подчиненными и штабами и т.д.   Размеры сценариев варьируются от ротного уровня до уровня бригады на картах размером 20 на 20 км, разделенных 500 метровыми гексами. Игра моделирует много современных боевых систем, включая М1 Абрамс, БМП Бредли, Чифтаны, Варриоры на стороне НАТО и Т-80, Ми-24 на стороне Советов.  Так же в игре представлены различные артиллерийские системы начиная от минометов и заканчивая самоходными гаубицами имеющие немалый арсенал боеприпасов - ОФ, дымовые, мины, кластерные, химические и даже ядерные заряды.  Стоит упомянуть и то, что разработчики совсем не забыли про игру, например Player's Edition, который уже сразу доступен в стиме это результат огромной работы разработчиком вместе с комьюнити. Игра продолжает развиваться и совершенствоваться.  Надеюсь это маленькое ревью поможет вам с выбором - стоит ли эта игра ваших денег.",

            "review_text": "Flashpoint Campaigns: Red Storm is a somewhat unconventional but very welcome gem of a hex&amp;counter wargame.  The twist it has going for it over so many wargames of this type is a very tight focus on what you command, limited capability to command (organization and electronic warfare interference), and most interestingly the variable turn length, which alters as the game progresses due to the influence of various factors, lose a few commander units and watch it rocket right up. Commands are issued at the start of each turns, and then the results play out themselves. Units also do not instantly react to your inputs either, and take time to begin doing what you order them to, and may be delayed not by just enemy action lowering their readiness levels but by roads getting clogged with traffic if you try and push too many units at once down a certain path or their commander's being too distant and the units worn down from extended battling.  The focus on regiment level command is something that could not really be replicated on tabletop in the same way, as it’s a very hands-off approach. Units, once set on their path, will use their own abilities to locate and attack enemies. What helps this is that much of the numbers are hidden (though they are viewable if you wish to check things) and so you’re not getting a face-full of dice rolls thrown up every time something happens, but rather audio cues, arrows indicating exchanges of fire, and explosions for artillery and counting off casualties, which all lends greatly to the atmosphere and sense that you are attempting to control the chaos of a battle in your favour.  Speaking of which, the atmosphere for the game is a kind of intense tension. With fog of war in place as intended (there’s an option to remove it as well as the limited orders per turn) contact with enemies is often fleeting unless a real slugging match is taking place or you've managed to secure good positioning for recon elements; an essential part of not getting surprised by a full companies of tanks and infantry barreling down a road towards you. The tension is a constant as you sit and watch a turn play out, making mental notes of enemy positions to direct artillery to and hoping your plan was good enough, or that you can adapt it in time to exploit an opening or counter a move.  When it comes to the armies themselves you do get the best results by playing them to their general doctrine. Brits cannot (most of the time) be used in fast armoured counter attacks like the West Germans, who in turn cannot normally successfully emulate the Soviets and send massive stabbing attacks of armour and mechanized infantry, shrugging casualties to envelop and breach their target objective’s defences. Whilst many scenarios as they come feature relatively high quality Guards units of Soviets with a myriad of BMP-2s and T-80BVs in their arsenals, a huge mass of equipment sporadically appears and can be used in creating your own scenarios.   Overall the game sticks well to it's intended style without getting confused or overwhelming you with mechanics, and produces some great battles and challenging campaigns.",

Can't say much that has not already been said by others here so I won't waste your time reading the same comments, but if you've been searching for a strategic wargame and nothing seems to scratch that itch, give this one a try. It has the right mix of depth, graphics, and gameplay that really make it stand out from other games. I do hope they continue to support this and even build upon it with other games using this as a forumla for success.",

Nato vs Warsaw Pact on German ground Cold War get´s hot.  Its not a classic turn-based game it´s using a WEGO system both player´s giving orders at the same time the fresh thing on it its using command cycles on normal conditions you are able to give all 20-30min in the battlephase orders if your hq gets destroyed or your unit move too far they have too deal with a 1hour or more command cycle.  it can get a little bit frustrating if the soviet kicked your ♥♥♥ but every time it´s clear that it´s your command that failed. a platoon of 4 tanks in the right position is able kicking ♥♥♥ of 30 enemy tanks without a loss brings you back all the time too do it better with the rest of ur units ;)  - and dont forget if the russian bear ist too strong NBC warfare is also on the table  dont buy the game if you expect something like Panzer Corp´s it´s a Heavy Simulation of Modern Warfare.  Cons - i dont like the Simple Windows style interface the controls are easy and all rechable on some clicks but it destroys the atmosphere the game build up in the Battles.",

            "review_text": "The implementation of the OODA loop through an asymmetric and dynamic orders cycle makes this an interesting game. Submitting orders and watching things play out is great, and the tension that builds from waiting for your next order cycle is palpable. Reading the manual, the level of detail in what is modeled and taken into account seems to be quite high, which is a good thing, though I at times I wish more information was relayed to the player (has the unit received the order? Is it still planning it's movement or is it stuck for some reason? etc).   The use of hexes and unit-level control requirements is an obvious departure from Panther's Command Ops series, which remains one of my favorites on account of its superb AI, but these differences are what makes FCRS a worthy title to enjoy alongside Command Ops because it's not trying to directly compete in the same space.   I haven't tried PBEM or PBEM++ yet, but anticipate that the turn based nature of the game may make it easier to maintain an ongoing game with someone than CommOps, whose realtime pausable system means both players need to be in the hotseat at the same time.  All in all, I'm very impressed from what I've seen so far!",
