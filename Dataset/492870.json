            "review_text": "  I found the gameplay fun, clean, fast, and somewhat addictive. It could, however, use some tuning of progression speeds to make it get less repetitive (level up slower/not after almost every round, fewer rounds in arenas, a few more options for ability progression maybe). More tutorial elements and some slight UI updates would also be helpful. Overall I think the game has a lot of potential, and with a few tweaks all over it could be a really lasting and fun experience.",
