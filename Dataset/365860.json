            "review_text": "Great game that throws you up against things that seem impossible at first but become possible and then even easy as you figure out how to play and use all the tools you have.  Death is constant but you get back into the fight instantly.  I'm not sure what else to say, other than that it's really really nice. The setting is cute. The fights are fun. The music is fantastic. Just get it, it's great.  ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️",
