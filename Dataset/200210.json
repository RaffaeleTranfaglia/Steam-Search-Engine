            "review_text": "Realm of the Mad God is a top down free to play MMO mouse aim shooter with a simple art style. It has been around for a few years as a Flash game. You start the game easy enough, by selecting from unlocked classes such as rogue, warrior, priest, archer and so on. Each class plays the same, you fire projectiles. Have a sword? You shoot projectiles. The only difference between the classes are the stats and the equipment they can use. You can unlock more classes when you reach certain levels with the base classes. Each enemy gives you some minimal experience and leveling up will only improve your stats. There are no new spells and no choice of improvement. It all feels very dull and too simple for a MMO.  The controls are like every other mouse aim shooter, arrows to move with mouse aim and click to shoot. You have a special ability and potions too, but for the most part you can just use your normal attacks. Speaking of the mouse aim, it feels very inaccurate. I can stand still, fire the projectile and the projectile will miss even when I shouldn't. Maybe there is an accuracy stat or something. It feels odd when enemies very accurate. Luckily you are quick enough to dodge projectiles. Again, maybe its a stat and I need to have better gear, but there is nothing on the equipment that shows accuracy, just range and attack power.  There are a lot of enemies, each with different stats and attack patterns. For the most part they have enemies simply shoot at you. Most have single shots, others have double and triple spreading shots. Still some fire a sort of 360 degree bullet shield preventing anything from getting close. The bosses aren't that different from normal enemies. They just have larger sprites with other creatures swarmed around them.  There are quests in the game, but I mean that in the vaguest sense of the word. All quests seem to be kill the big monster. No one tells you to. You just do it. The game points out the direction of the big monster when you enter the location.  The maps feel a bit jumbled randomly with trees and foliage with a path drawn through the map. It just feels like lazy or quick map design and not 'randomly generated.' Some enemies will drop portals to different areas which is a fun feature, but since the areas look just thrown together its always just another randomly thrown together area. You have a mini map that will reveal more as you explore, but if you leave an area and return, you need to explore it again to show it on your mini map. At any time out in the wilderness, you can instantly warp back to the town / nexus with the click of a button.   The locations might look like a jumbled mess, but the town / nexus looks great, but its all just a big store to sell you stuff. All of the stores have items visibly showing you everything so you need to walk over them instead of having an easy to use menu. Another problem is to see the stats of the item you need to hover your mouse over the 'buy it' button. Don't accidentally click that button though. You cannot sell equipment, so you're forced to drop it or trade it with other players, but for the most part the equipment feels useless when enemies drop it all. Plus players are kind enough to just give stuff for free since everything is so abundant.  Normal games would have you kill enemies for gold, but in Realm of the Mad God, you need to buy gold with real money of course. Everything is right there in town / nexus for you to buy after a brief tutorial area. What do you buy with gold? Name changes, more characters, armor, weapons, rings, boxes with random items, keys, pets, extra storage, building materials and everything. Did I mention that when you die you lose all progress and items? So if you spend real life money into a free game and you die, you've just lost everything. Do you need gold to have fun? No. The town / nexus has plenty of people selling gold via their website for real money and it floods the chat for some servers drowning out any real discussion.  This feels like a really dull game that is out for your money. Not just that, but it seems hastily thrown together. The quick simple art style, the slow grind for experience, the awful map design, no real quests, the laggy input, and the inaccurate aiming, all makes me not want to be in the game let alone buy anything in the game with real money.",

I know, I know, you're probably thinking it's just a game, you shouldn't even rage, yea, yea 'Git Gud'. But, because it's permadeath, you lose everything, everything you've earnt. I almost had a heart attack, or an aneurism. Let me tell you, when you get attached to one character, you are one with the character, and when you die in the game, it feels like dying in real life. No joke.   It’s not a bad game, proof? Well you wouldn’t see people play this game for hundreds of hours if it was a bad game. In addition I played way more of this game on the internet version. Yea it consumed me (not as much as it did for others though).  Like I said, I have a love hate relationship with this game, and you’ll begin to understand me when you at least clock up 50-100 hours of the game.  ",

I'm giving a bad review because of a game-breaking bug leaving myself, and many other players stuck out of the game, completely unable to play.  The developers are aware of the bug at this point, and after having many conversations with support about the issue, it seems that they simply don't care.  The bug in question, is getting stuck on the black screen with the grey 'Loading' ribbon across the bottom. Even if left for hours, the game will never actually load. I initially contacted support about this back in February, and I've had to make multiple tickets due to previous ones automatically closing.  To this day, the issue is still unresolved for me. I'll update this review if that changes, but I'll probably leave it as a negative because of what a joke the support team is.

            "review_text": "This has got to be one of my favorite free to play MMOs of all time. It has great coop gameplay which relies on skill to stay alive, and staying alive is very important because it is a PERMADEATH game. It runs in Flash, so its compatible with almost all systems. The graphics are a retro pixelated masterpiece and will definitely bring on the nostalgia. The game has no ending, making it very addictive. This game is still being updated regularly and new content is being added all the time. There are 14 classes to unlock, loads of items to be found, dungeons for all skill levels, and a guild system to help encourage cooperation.  This game is also full of bugs that are difficult to fix, given the nature of the coding. The bugs aren't game-breaking but can get annoying at times. There is an unsolvable issue with memory leaks that will force you to restart the game every hour or so. Spambots advertise for websites that sell items illegally. Do not buy anything from them. The items they sell can be farmed in the game without spending any money. There is a trading system which you can use to buy, sell, trade, or gift items with other players. Do not spend money on items, it is a waste!  Some people, including myself, experience a bit of lag when playing the Steam version of this game. If you have issues such as input delay, I encourage you to give it another shot by playing it at its home,  www.realmofthemadgod.com .  With all that in mind, I still thoroughly enjoy this game and support its development by buying extra vault space and character slots. I would recommend it to anyone who likes skill based shooters and MMORPGs. Did I mention its FREE?!  Update: Since I quit playing RotMG regularly, a lot has changed. The old management is out and new people have taken their place and seem to be doing much better. They seem to make much better use of their resources and have their priorities in a much better order. The game and owners/developers are making much needed progress and deserve a little recognition.",

It's gonna be very hard NOT to spend money on it, but it's worth it if you like the game enough.  (edit: a year after i wrote this)  i still die every day, my characters literally do not last for more than 5 days. my mind practically revolves around this game and i've spent around $300 on it. i've invested around 700+ hours on this piece of rainbow ♥♥♥♥ and my deaths actually do frustrate me now because i'm actually maxed.   but anyway, this game is better when playing with friends, or if you have a guild. when it's late and you're the only one up, you can just relax and farm in the godlands. even if you're rich as hell, npe's with friends will help ease the boredom. this game also has its own economy, not like cs:go, tf2, or dota where you could trade via steam and steam chat, but in the game itself, and the company that owns the game will help you with all your problems but they do not care about trading itself, only bug fixes and blah blah. trading in this game isn't as profitable as godlands farming though, due to the amount of time it takes although you could always go on realmeye which is similar to tf2outpost or cs:go lounge to post trades and wait for someone to PM you while youre actually playing the game.  the main goal in this game is probably to max. 6/8 is a start to new players. for players who already have all 12 characters 8/8 maxed with all the gear they want, they usually make another set of backup characters or start a collection - like all the ut's in the game or all the treasures or all the tops.  i see nothing wrong with the community besides (i say nothing and besides in the same sentence ironicly) some chat spammers who could easily be ignored, and even notifers seem to be a problem but i don't mind them. the people are fine though, except for the leechers, but can you blame them? - update 8 months after i wrote the second update: i like how they fixed the notifers. i didn't understand it at first, since i thought any time you entered a realm you'd have to wait 2 minutes but it makes sense on how you could just nexus in case you almost die or store some pots in your inventory and re-enter the realm without having to wait.  anyway, realm lag. it's not your internet, it's realm, it always has been realm. i haven't played in months (though i have around 1,300 hours on it including my hours on steam) and i can see that the lag is slightly better, but not all the way better. there's still only around 3-4 lucky hours of the day where there's no noticable lag. i'm sure with the hella loads of updates they did a month or two ago this summer that they tried fixing it, still i don't see why they can't add more ram to the servers with the amount of money people spend in a month of just playing the game.  i think that's one of the main reasons people stop playing realm. the first reason is that realm is the gamer's heroin and you should probably only play under an hour a day, 3 days a week or you'll get sucked into the vortex of neverending gameplay and the financially broke life.",

Although, you can buy things to advance yourself without putting much effort into the game, which is, of course fine. But anyhow, the game is very fun.

Going around, starting over, killing, farming, getting your character to maxed level which is 20 then going and getting potions to upgrade your character is quite an experience; you have to invest lots of time into the game; and its worth it, because in the end, you feel like you accomplished something especially since some people just quit because it's 'too hard' or 'frustrating to lose everything when I die', when its fixed to the point you lose everything when you die.. it makes it more intruging, you actually have some insentive to not just say '♥♥♥♥ all' and run around like an idiot without a care and to actually play smartly and do things correct...

Witch means you always dont want to equip your best gear because your afraid of dying.i have only just finished getting to lv20 for the 3rd time and after that dont go running to gods rightaway you want to stay back do enough damage to get loot. Players in RotMG have a thing called 8/8 it means 8 out of 8 of thier sts are maxed. To max a stst you have you get sts potions witch drop from gods yet since your not 8/8 its very difficult to do.

You can play the game absolutely free, but you can also support the game and go the easy way by doing micro transactions within the game itself for items or customization. Part of this game is dying, especially by being a little too greedy or picking a bad teleport to some random person on the map. However, the max character level is 20 and it is easy to get back up there from level 1 in an hour. There are different levels of items and each class has its own special ability item as well. There are also pets that you can find or buy to give you in game bonuses. I don't like all the changes they've made since I first started playing it, but I still love the game.

            "review_text": "The funny thing is, Realm of the Mad God (which I will abbreviate as Rotmg) is probably my second favorite game on steam. Now you may be wondering why I do not recommend this. I personally like this game myself, but this is for those who are new or are considering the download. Rotmg is a bullet hell fantasy 'shooter' (I guess you could vaguely call it one.) It's played in a top down style and has an interesting graphics palette. I do not consider myself 'good'(although I will call myself decent.) So what are the key concepts of rotmg? Well the first major one is a love hate situation. Permadeath. You may have heard of this mechanic, but it basically means dead is dead. Which means that you lose all of your items and potions you used on that character. But don't worry, characters usually last for months if you know how to play well. This has actually caused a lot of players to quit by losing for example, only, or favorite character. However, there is sort of a counter to this, which is known as a Vault. The vault is exactly what it seems like. It's room with a private chest where you can put your own items in . They never leave unless you take them. So, overall you may think this is a great game, which, it is.  But the thing is, at around late 2012, rotmg started to fall into decline, it was subtle at first, but eventually it was very noticeable. Where did this come from? The most probable (and everyone blames it on this) reason is Kabam. What's Kabam? Kabam is a game company, they own Rotmg. Now the reason I said own is because they did not make the game, the game itself was created by Wild Shadow Studios. Now Kabam bought Wild Shadow in late 2012, and one of the first things they did was remove Amulets of Resurrection. Basically these were things you could wear that stopped you from dying if you got to 0 hp. Now, that may sound overpowered, but scammies did cost a lot in 'fame' which is all the xp you gain. When Kabam removed amulets, a lot of players quit, and killed a lot of players to show their ignorance. But for a while, all was quiet and peaceful until about February 2013, now this is when I can start to recall things, because I actually started playing in Jan. 2013. In about February, Kabam did something to the Nexus Shops that we will all remember. Now, for those who do not understand. The Nexus is an area that's a safe haven, it's similar to like the Forums of Rome, you can chat there, some nexuses are devoted to trading, etc. When Wild Shadow was in control, there were shops in the nexus. You could use fame, which I previously mentioned, on some items, or Realm Gold, an ingame currency bought with real money. Realm Gold is worth about 1:1 cent. 100 Realm Gold is a dollar. Realm Gold in the old days could buy, hell I don't even know what it could buy, but I think you bought stuff like backpacks and XP Boosters with it, which they still do today. You can also buy vault chests and character slots, unlike some companies, Wild Shadow managed their ingame currency pretty well, not trying to nickel and dime you. But what Kabam did in February last year, was to sell GOOD items in the nexus. Now what Kabam used to do, was sell what most people thought were 'junk' in the nexus. For example, by most players who would regard an item as trash, a particular sword, costed about 200 Realm Gold. Now although this was a ripoff, most players were happy and fine, because not to many people would be 'stupid' enough to buy them, but Kabam started selling higher tiered items for about the same price. This made players angry, all their hard work could go to waste by a few clicks and a username and password on paypal. At first it was just weapons and armor. But then Kabam added 'tops.' Tops are one of the best items in the game, Tier 12 weapons, Tier 13 Armor. These could cost almost $9 at most, and made a lot of players angry. However, Kabam made it even worse, by selling Abilities, special items that each class has, and rings, stat boosting items, in the nexus. Now to put the icing on the cake, Kabam did something that devestated a lot of players, and still a big deal. This was around May 2013, Kabam made all 'Untiered' (very good items) Soulbound, which means they cannot be tradable. Kabam did this to 'prevent duping' and they would fix duping. Almost 2 years and still, their soulbound.   Lately, Kabam has actually been doing a good job. But this review is advice for new players, I promise you, you probably won't have the best experience. There are less people in the servers, this game is slowly dying.",

Spending money in this game is not required, but they definitly want you to feel like that. Kabam does not seem to be coming back to in my opinion one of their best games, which is really saddening because this game is great. Permadeath makes you want and care not to die and I do my part of rageing in this game but still it is very enjoyable. Whenever I quit due to a rough death I feel like coming back. I am a relatively new player though and have spent money on this game and I do feel the boundraries of paying and not. Still worth the time and it is still a FREE game at the base of it.",

On the other hand, this game is very P2W (Pay to win). You start off having one character slot to make 1 of 14 classes and a single vault chest that holds 8 items that will not be lost upon death. It is almost necessary to purchase more vault chests and character slots as you begin to get better at the game. Not to mention pets. Once you have leveled up your pet, (Common -&gt; Uncommon -&gt; Rare -&gt; Legendary -&gt; Divine), it is virtually impossible to get past a maxed legendary pet without dropping some cash into this game. That being said, your pet, vault chests, and character slots cannot be taken from you, and will be on your account forever.  Overall, this game is hard to get into, but offers some incredible game play that can last you for years.",

It would takes over a hundred dollars to even unlock all of your storage space. Even the big fans of the game do not buy additional storage, but instead go make additional characters on the game's website and on Kongragate to use as additional storage and are known as 'mules.' Even when using mules it is annoying.  The gameplay is good, a semi-rogue like where your characters die and stay dead but you can store items to help your next character. The Nexus, the central hub of the game, is constantly filled with advertisers that will fill up your screen instantly. The gameplay is frustrating at times, especially because you can die very quickly with little to no warning, but is fun. The higher level you get, the more cautious you have to be.

If you want to pay, then pay. If you don't want to, then don't.   It's so absurd how people just hate this game because it became Pay To Win or is Pay To Win. You still can enjoy this game WITHOUT paying. Like, who gives a ♥♥♥♥ if a guy who paid money for this game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you off. Think of it like he/she is a Pay To Win Noob :). You can get good in this game even if you're F2P. It's also fun with friends.

        {
            "review_text": "First of all, I'd like to say that while there are certainly those who are more qualified than me to judge this game, I feel I have played it enough (and over a long enough time span) to write an accurate review. And yes, I only got it on steam so I could review it, meaning that I've played for quite a bit longer than 0.2 hours using the browser version.  Next, I give this a *very* tentative recommendation, since this game is great for some and hell for others.  Now, for the actual review:  Before you read the rest this, just know that in order to really enjoy this game, you're going to have to fork over some cash. As many wrote before me, the “second” developers (who acquired the game some time ago) have made this a micro-transaction based game, in which “realm gold” (which equates roughly to 100 = $1) can be used to buy many items, as well as things like storage space and the ability to have more characters in your account. Since you start out only able to store 8 items and have one character, (I have ~8x the storage and 5 characters, and still feel I need more) the latter are VERY important, assuming you actually want to become somewhat good at the game.  It didn’t always used to be quite like this. The original developers, Wildshadow, were, to the best of my knowledge, not bad devs. Sure, the pay-to-win aspects were there, but when Kabam bought ROTMG, it became all about squeezing as much money as possible out of this once great tube of permadeath toothpaste. In fact, it seems almost as if Kabam thinks our lovely toothpaste tube is near empty, because certain aspects of the game are starting to fall apart (which I’ll cover in a bit). Like another reviewer said, in ROTMG, your greatest weapon is your credit card. And every time someone uses the best weapon in the game, Kabam’s breath is freshened with the minty green toothpaste known as money. If you don’t want to buy into any pay-to-win/micro transaction games, look elsewhere.  Another problem: Everyone hacks. Well, not everyone, but so many do that I’m not even sure people are banned for it. It’s gotten to the point where people can admit it openly and people don’t really seem to care. If you like hacking, I suppose this might be a plus, but for those of you that like to play legitimately, you might be frustrated that others have an unfair advantage.  The game also sometimes likes to disconnect you. While bugs aren’t terribly common, one very annoying one involves kicking an entire realm of people back to the menu with the error “Load error, retrying...”, and not letting them back on for maybe 5-10 mins. It’s not a huge deal, except I’ve seen reports of this bug going back into 2013. Something as irritating as this should have probably been fixed by now, especially since it’s not like many huge releases have been taking up the developers’ time.  One last thing that ROTMG lacks is a compassionate community. In this game, everyone is out for themselves. And if you want to be a successful player, selfishness is a quality you should exemplify, as well. As such, don’t expect to have very many friendly interactions with others.  After all these negatives, you might be wondering why I actually recommended this game. The truth is, it’s still very fun most of the time, and offers something few MMOs do. Namely, permanent death. This isn’t really a positive or a negative, since everyone seems to have their own opinion on the matter. While it does help drive the economy, as new gear/”stat potions” (which increase a character’s statistics, like how fast they move or how much health they have) are always in demand. However, people tend to invest a lot of time in a good character, so losing one is never a fun experience.  Despite these warnings, if a more open MMO is what you’re looking for, I’d recommend at least trying out ROTMG. While it’s less fun if you’re just starting out, the longer you spend, and the better your characters get, the more this game will latch onto your mind, demanding you play it over and over again.",

If you're playing for fun than i guess it's fine but once u get gud at the game and there are no more goals for you to reach, you will eventually quit and think ' why did i waste my time on this dead game' Some of the reasons you will hate this game are:  - Severe game balancing issues! Land tons of damage with one class and steal loot from other poor useless players! - No serious updates in years! You can play the same dungeons again, and again and again! And then some more!  - Rampant cheating! And if this doesn't still sell this to you, also know that the company now managing the game, the infamous Kabam, totally ignores cheater reports! - Poisonous community! Scammers? We got those! Leechers? Of course, the game actually encourages leeching! Racial and homophobic insults? Goes without saying! - Pay to win!!! You think you can max your pet without spending real money? Think again!!! And if you don't feel like buying game gold, just check out the black market spambots that make the game chat window completely unusable! - Much, much more!  However iv'e been playing this game for almost 3 years and it's still fun (at times) what keeps me going on this game is  1. The Goals i want to achieve ( White star, Seal of Blas , Rich ,10K BaseFame ) 2. Friends in game ( TayBS , Zenoren ) 3. Guilds ( WolfArmy ) Well i guess that's all i can say for now.

I am an old skool gamer, so the pixelated style is right up my alley. The gameplay is also pretty good, with different characters and stats to level up by killing all sorts of beasts, gods, and conquering dungeons--including the one belonging to the Mad God Oryx himself.  There is lots of stuff to do, lots of people to play with and to help defeat your foes. Pets, rare items, dungeon crawling, beastie bashing... did I mention it is really addictive if you are into this sort of thing?  The big downside is the gold can only be purchased with real money, and the dollar to gold exchange rate really sucks (though I shouldn't expect complete fairness in a fantasy world, but still, $5 for 500 or 5,000 gold seems fair to me). There are some people who pay TONS to get the best gear, create the ultimate pet, and basically make themselves a pixelized Master of The Universe (He-Man not included).   With the constant, looming threat of permanent death (when you die, bye bye goes ALL your stuff... EVERYTHING), any money spent on your character will be tossed out the window the minute you fall in battle.  Overall, fun game, but the Pay-To-Win part is kinda lame. Gold exchange rate needs to be a bit fairer, but I doubt that will happen in all honesty.  Update: Sadly, it seems that this game's popularity has dropped off the face of the earth. There are barely any people around any more, and certainly not anyone I recognize (aside from one or two people). Who knows, maybe I am just logging in at the wrong times.",

I want to also mention the alchemist remember when it was actually GOOD? Completing quests was a good idea to get better loot and sometimes a dye or something else. But then they changed the quests to give you useless transformation and ok loot potions. And worst of all to get the points to spend on the alchemist you have to get tarot cards. Yeah, good luck getting them without any powerful items and ultimate luck. Actually the pay to win of this game is a lot worse. Before, you could get stuff with FAME. Like the ammy, remember that? Well, then they changed it to the cursed amulet of ressurection to the cusred amulet of zombification.Just why? Now fame is almost worthless, only to feed your pet and make a guild. And theres a review that says:'This is a bonkers top-down shooter MMO that bucks typical MMO conventions. Death has real consequences and the 30+ classes are unlocked as you go.' Now what are these 30+ characters? There are only 14 characters. All i can say about this game at this point is that the title is supposed to say: Realm Of The Mad Shop.",

You don't need to buy anything. 2.) You can earn all the gear they sell, the gear being sold is a shortcut that really doesn't matter in the long run because they're not stat pots, and 3.) When Swatsec killed everyone at Nexus, Kabam gave everyone their characters back(as in revived their characters) and made a dungeon and tons of awesome vanity items as an apology.  This game is amazing and it doesn't require you to pay money, the only things you have to buy are basic luxeries like dyes and cloths to color and style your character, and to buy vault chests. Those are also all you should buy with your money, because the gear being sold is not actually that good in the long run if you don't get stat potions, and they aren't going to make it that much easier if you aren't good at the game, instead they're just kind of a shortcut to get to that stage of gear in the game. If they sold Stat Potions you could say it's more pay to win, but they don't.  This game is amazing and I play it most days because it's fast, skill based, and a lot of fun. Cruel but fair.",

Let it sit in the vault gathering dust, or die with it?  I pose the question: What's the point?  Yes, it's addicting, but what do you get out of it? Nothing aside from fame - which you spend, so even that isn't permanent, which is stupid - you have to die to pay for things? What kind of messed up system is this?

Let's get one thing straight; Realm of the Mad God (ROTMG) is a good, fun game. Yes, you read that correctly. It has it's flaws, but overall, I'd say it's a good, fun game. Why is this review negative? We'll get to that in a minute. In the meantime; THE POSITIVES!  If you've never played, ROTMG is a 2D top-down shooter type game, that plays somewhat rougelike, with the exception of vaults that you can keep, although it has minimal storage unless you buy more with real $$$. It has lots of dungeons to explore, metric TONS of enemies to slash through, and many different classes to play, each with their own playstyle and abilities.   The main 'goal' of the game is to kill 'The Mad God; Oryx.' However, with practice and teamwork, this is easily achieved. What most players consider to be a worthy challange is 'Maxing' all eight (8) stats on their character (Becoming an 8/8, or 'Fully Maxed' player) Using stat upgrade potions, dropped from various enemies and bosses.   It IS fun, it has quite a bit of content, especially for a newcommer, and in fact, with how often you die*, you could say it has great replay value too, needing to put in more hours, create more characters, try different playstyles, die more after you find a playstyle that doesn't work too well*, '8/8' the characters the survive long enough for you to do so, ect.  However, those asterisks that you may've seen: Death. Death is more common than air in ROTMG. You go into almost any realm, I can GURANTEE that someone has died in it. This may not seem that big a deal, about two (2) people die IRL every second, (True Fact) so why is a big deal here? The problem comes when you realize that you can sometimes spend LITERAL YEARS on some of these characters, (Which, I have done, Though not documented due to playing via website and not Steam) and even spend real $$$ too. Then, it's not okay.  Also, you may notice, I keep bringing up the subject of..... the dreaded.... MICROTRANSACTIONS! D; Yes, they're here, and they are PLENTIFUL. It's called 'gold', and it's used for EVERYTHING. Want to change your character's name? Gold. Wanna buy some equips without trading? Gold. Wanna upgrade your pet without wasting away in the eternal pit of hell named 'EUNorth2'? GOLD. Wanna have more than one character at a time, or more vault space for those characters?  GOLD!  Frankly, I find it worse than playing a mobile game with how much this 'Free' game tries to rob you blind whilst playing it.  Another tick aganst this game is the characters; Something which SHOULD be a positive addition to this game. The problem? They're unbalanced as all heck. Some characters like, 'Priest,' 'Necromancer,' and 'Mystic' are almost un-playable, with how much they struggle to obtain even the most common of loot. They are easily out-damaged, hard to/impossible get any equips that make them worth playing, and just generally ignoreable.  On the other side of the spectrum: 'Wizard' and 'Warrior.' Where to even begin with this duo...? Let's start with the main reason for playing these two classes: The stats. Both have the highest ATK (Attack) Stat possible in the game without equips, and Wizard in particular, can achieve the highest total ATK, and highest DPS (Damage Per Second) in the game. Warrior, also pumps out an impressive amount of DPS, and can also be configured to have the highest total DEF (Defense) Stat in the game, short of being invincible. This makes them extremely Overpowered, and makes playing any other class not recommended at best, and downright pointless at worst.  There's one more point I'd like to make before ending this review; Pros. Here's the thing: Pros are inevitable. If you have a game, people will get good at it. Those good people will continue to be good, and will be better than other players. Problem is, in a pay-to-win game that's otherwise  LUCK BASED , Having so many 'Pros' that can easily out-damage you on bosses, Get to &amp; Kill events faster than you, and generally be more effecient than you at the game, can be VERY frustrating.  This, is the biggest point to me, because of a fact; No matter how much you play this game, or even how much money you decide to spend, SOMEONE WILL BE BETTER THAN YOU. This kills the ENTIRE point of a video game to me; Something to pour your extra hours into, untill you become the best you can be, and feel the sense of accomplishment, and feel like you did something worthwhile.  In sum, This game is fun, but only if you can settle for having some features of the game locked away behind solid-gold prison bars, and accepting the fact that you will never be the best player.",

            "review_text": "Welp. I kinda like this game but I cant reccomend it. Soooooooooooooooooo Realm of the mad god is a top down RPG game with A ♥♥♥♥ TON of microtransactions. Kill me. You can choose alot of classes and the one im baseing this review with is the knight considering ive played a while with it. Now ive played a bit of this game so I could make a better review.  So this game is not completley TRASH but its not the best. Any fans of the game im sorry. Again you dont have to put in money which dont worry I didnt do, but holy crap you baseiclly cant play otherwise. I am currently a level 20 knight with very good defense and offense and I cant stand 1 minute in certain sections, and its not just my skill level. So what do you do? You pay a lot of money to (Goes back to first review) make you feel like your good and progressing but really arent. Now lets say they removed the micro transactions so you could get all these items natrually by playing the game and make it cost a little bit. It would be waaay better. So in the game you need to go around defeating bosses for quests and level up and eventually after you have killed all his servants the mad gods castle will spawn. Now once you get through that raid you get to fight him and kill him. You have health potions which will regen your health and also mana potions which will regen your mana. Now your mana is for pressing space to use your charecters ability.    Section 2: Tricks. While I was editing this it turns out there is a trick! yay. That trick being if you are in a sticky situation (which you are alot in this game) you can warp out and leave your freinds to die.    Section 3: Reccomendation. Well, its a free game so theres that. You can pick it up if you want but overall I would reccomend you do not put money or time into this game. Maybe if you have nothing to do you can pick it up but otherwise no.   Section End: Rating. Well as you know (if you have read my other reviews and you should! If you do it would be kind of you to give them a good rating considering I put time into them but I guess you dont have to.) I give games an extra point if they are free so I give this game a 5/10. Average.    Edit: So, stupid me forgeting to put that this game is a permerdeath game so if you die with those items you spent money on, they are gone. How anoying is that? Also, I felt like I should go into detail on me saying that you feel like your progressing but you really arent doesnt just aply to the microtransactions, it aplys to the game. So me (a lvl 20 knight) will end up wandering around the place looking for a boss to kill or a raid to do. But the main problem of this issue is that once you reach the max lvl 20, the wonder (I guess you could say) goes away. After that all you do is either try to unlock new classes (which is not very fun to do) or try to get new items. (which takes forever) All to lead up to the final castle with oryx which is probably the best part of this game. Now I will go a little in depth on the oryx fight and his castle. The reason this is probably the best part of the game is that it takes everyone from the server (which is a lot of people by the way) and ♥♥♥♥♥ them out into a castle. The cool thing about this castle is that even low levels have acess to it. Which means they can fight along the higher levels too. Here the game gives some teamwork action! (which is what this raid needed.) Now, im not saying that this game dosent have any 'teamwork action' in it. You feel like your traversing through a dungeon and helping the lower levels make it through. (if you dont want to do the castle just yet you can warp) But oryx is where it all falls down. Your going to NEED microtransaction items to beat this hunk of junk because holy hell you cant beat him otherwise. His attacks are to strong and your damage is too low. Camping around other players wont help because you will get seperated alot. After all that he drops some armor or something for everyone to rush to and pick up. So what is the point of this long edit? Progression. That is what this game lacks. You can play for hours and not get ANYWHERE execpt killing bosses that wont help you in the end. Now I will proably continue playing this game if not to help my freind level up and crap. Also that can get really boring. So yes the progression system in this game is TRASH, some people may not think so but they are usuly people who spend money on this game. My rating will stay the same as it is, my opinon on this game has not changed and it will not. Sorry for this wall of text. Good Day.    Quick Message: One of the main problems with this game is that it is boring. Boring to grind up items. Boring to try to reach max fame. Boring to fight a boss you have fought tons of times before just to level up. Once the wonder of leveling is gone there really is nothing left other than to kill oryx.",

Its not as much as the fact that they added tops to the nexus. No, its the fact that THEY MAKE IT THE EASIEST WAY TO GET THEM. Your other options are killing the mad god HIMSELF or buying it, the first of which takes tremendous skill and computer power and the other taking SO VERY LONG. Before who cared if they had tops? It was fun to simply play with what you had. Then also, the scammers. People are such aholes that they will STEAL YOU ITEMS FROM YOU and sometimes SELL IT FOR REAL MONEY!!! Know what thats called? The flipping black market. The flipping black market is in this game. This is all not to mention the OUTRAGEOUS amount of crashes and lag deaths that is caused by this game. Its perma death, and you didnt just die from stupidity. No, you died because of something YOU DO NOT CONTROL. And guess what? Kabam wont revive your character. They refuse to revive something that died because of total accident on your computers and partly their fault. This review would be ten times longer IF I HAD THE TIME TO WRITE IT. Not only this, but it also seems that PEOPLE CAN HACK YOUR ACCOUNT. A famous youtuber on the game named TEEBQNE was hacked by a keylogger. Most of his characters that he had WHERE KILLED. Most of which had BACKPACKS ON THEM AND OTHER THINGS BOUGHT WITH MONEY!!! And what did Kabam do? They didnt do sh%$. They just sat by and waited until THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY MADE THEM. THIS SH%$ IS WHAT MADE ME QUIT THIS GAME, AND NOW IT LAYES IN SOME FORGOTTEN PLACE ON MY TOOLBAR, UNTOUCHED FOR MONTHS. THIS GAME HAS GONE TO SH%$ KABAM, AND YOU ARE TO BLAME. I DO NOT RECCOMENT PLAYING THIS DECEASED GAME, FOR BEFORE KABAM TOOK OVER I RATED 9/10; I NOW RATE IT 0/10",

Kabam sucks at game development and should just give up with there other ♥♥♥♥ titles as well. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Its a good hard game if you dont care about graphics and like the old school Galaga type games with a RPG class twist.  While it does have a cash shop where you can buy equipment for real money, you can easily earn it ingame when you become good. If youre not at that level then you will just lose it when you die which also btw, is really over priced (I doubt anyone buys them). The only real P2W thing about this game is the pet system at a very late level that you may never expierence anyway.  So anyway, you go reach level 20. Do dungeon runs to get all your stats maxed with stat pots. Get good gear. Try to reach 5 star fame by getting 2k 'exp'. Die, repeat. Try harder dungeons. Repeat. A bit sandboxy I guess.",

(You start out with 8 storage spaces to keep extra loot, though.)  Overall, it's a fun game for solo play AND group play with the inclusion of guilds. It's easy to set short term and long term goals alike with various play styles to experiment with. If you decide to support the game, recommending it to friends and creating RotMG related content such as YouTube videos can go a long way in helping the community expand, which the game sorely needs right now. The only major downsides to this game are that you can get easily frustrated with deaths if you don't stock up on spare items in your vault chest(s), and lag will be an issue depending on your connection and whether you play on steam, a web browser, or adobe projector.  (Contrary to what people might say, this game is not pay-to-win. You cannot pay for potions that will max the stats of your character, the highest quality gear is only available from dungeons, and the gear you -can- buy will still be lost quick if you're unskilled and die often. For the most part, this game is pay-to-speedup, and there's nothing wrong with that. Character slots and storage space must be purchased with real money, but are only required if you don't want to put the effort to make and manage alternate accounts, or 'mules' as the Realm community likes to call them.)",

It has a simple interface with no story other than the fact that you're spose ta' kill Oryx. So in other words Realm says 'Screw story, just go kill stuff.' and I love that. It also has a perma death system where you lose all your stuff, but I think this adds to the fun and challenge. However despite being a great game at heart, Kabam, the new owner of the game, has in a way ruined the game taking it way off course from the path the old indie devs had for it. You see, they've monetized the game at almost every corner making it way less fun and enjoyable. So, in the somewhat sad end I recommend the game if you have some friends to play with, but other than that you will most likely feel like a bag of money more than a pixelated hero.",

DEATH, DEATH IS INEVITABLE, DEATH IS PERMANENT   Do not be fooled by the retro 8-bit-ish graphics, this is a difficult game. It has a considerable learning curve. You will need to spend time on it, to experience the true wonders it can show you. It is a great game and for the price (free) is readily recommended.  You will find many reviews here comparing the game to what it was a couple of years ago. I will not do that because I feel that the game has evolved and had it remained what it was 2 or so years ago it would have died a slow death. The developers still support this game and many quality of life (QoL) changes have been made in the past six months with the additional dungeons and other contents that gets added from time to time.   This is a free game that has a very small download and install size. It is an online game which can run on pretty much any system. You can play this game with your friends or find new ones in-game. Join a guild or make a new one if you have enough fame.   Life and Perma-death:  When you die you lose everything that was on your character and start afresh with a new character in the nexus. You will level up your character. They can be leveled up to level 20. Thereafter you can farm different stat potions, that drop from high level monsters and various dungeon bosses, to increase your stats. You can max all the stats if you drink enough of these potions. These very same potions also act as currency for player trades, so you always have a decision to make: drink the potion to become a little stronger or save enough for better equipment. Then you die and start over again. The cycle goes on.   Bullet Hell:  This is a bullet hell MMO. There will be bullet flying in all directions. You'll have to learn the enemy patterns and dodge a lot.     Somethings to consider:   This game is a free download as such there are a lot of bots you will find in the safe areas of the game. The game has its own mechanism of dealing with this. As a result of these mechanisms you'll not be able to usefully utilise the games social features till about a couple of hours into the game. When you attain 2 stars, you'll be above most peoples' chat filters and hence be able to chat, trade and most importantly block out the chat spamming bots.  This game sells items for real world money. There are things like dye, extra character slots and extra storage space that can only be bought with real money. Apart from that all the weapons, armor and other equipment can be attained in game without spending any money. In my time spent with the game I have not spent any money on the game.  This is an online game. Even school kids play it. Treat it with as much caution as you would treat any other thing on the internet. 'If something sounds too good to be true, it is.'",

You have a pretty big choice of playable classes but in order to play them you would first have to unlock them and then delete your old character since there is only 1 character slot available for free players. The gameplay itself is very repetitive though slightly amusing and addictive. Same thing for the soundtrack, it is basically 2 bars of 8-bit music (which is pretty catchy the first time you hear it) playing over and over and over until you're so sick of it that you might actually throw up. Maybe overpriced 8-bit MMORPG's just aren't my cup of tea but if you're willing to pay up that much you might like it. I give it an overall 4/10 score.",

A simple control scheme let's you hop right in with a speed bump of a learning curve. You're not expected to make a hero that lives forever, as much as play a class, do great things, and hope you're recognized for it. Reaching certain levels with other classes leads to unlocking more classes, each having a new way of being played.

            "review_text": "Addictive like you wouldn't believe. Realm of the Mad God provides a unique and refreshing take on the free to play MMO genre. It's got a charming 8-bit graphics style, a perma-death feature, and loads of fun content. That's right when you die in Realm of the Mad God you're dead for good. It's not actually a bad thing, sure you lose all of your gear and your character progress, but you never feel like the game is over for you. With numerous classes death gives you a fresh start to try something new. The gameplay is simple but addictive. You basically just run around and shoot everything in a large open world. As you gain levels you can fight tougher monsters and get better gear. There's no PVP, but rather the game encourages you to team up with people to take on the games more difficult monsters. The beauty of it is that you don't have to team up with other people if you don't want to. You can very well be a lone wolf, but the game is easier if you team up with others. The best part of this game is that you can play the game any way you want to. You can choose if you want to max out one character class, or you can stick with the class just long enough to unlock another one. You can play for hours at a time or just in short bursts. It's simple, addictive, and very accessible. The only real complaint I have is the lack of friendly players. So far most of the people I've come across are only interested in talking to you if you have something to offer them. In the end though I'm completely addicted to Realm of the Mad God. It's tons of fun and truly free to play outside of micro-transactions. So if your looking for a fun experience and are strapped for cash, or just love fun games, check of Realm of the Mad God.",

However I feel as though a new golden age is going to arrive. After the garbage ownership of Kabam this game started to die and it was happening fast. Then alas the great news Kabam was selling the game to a company named DECA GAMES. And what was this companies motto? 'Breathing life into older games.' It's almost like they were destined to one day own the game and save realm. They have already done a great job addressing the issues Kabam just let happen because they couldn't care less. These being Hackers, Multiboxers, and spammers. Things that just make the game look sloppy to a new player thinking 'This game is 6 years old and they still haven't fixed this?' However that is all coming to an end, and we have already been promised new content from DECA, and they have also start MOTMG which is rewarding anticing things both for new players and old.   So do I reccomend you give this game a shot?  HELL YES, this is definitely a must try for all gamers imo.",

Me, no i wont pay for a game unless its DLC not gold. Rethink your way of gaming because not alot of people willl play if you gotta pay for simple stuff.

The downside to the game is it's use of micro-transactions for buying basically anything. You can play the game, like I have, without paying a cent but you probably don't get the benefits of early Epic gear or other benefits.

This game is very fun to play because it is an MMO in which everyone works as a team to fight one major boss. This game is exceptionally fun when playing with friends and has a real teamwork mechanism built in, the one life rule. This causes teamwork because if you have only one life then your life has a much greater value to you. Although this mechanic does gat annoying it is cool.

I go on my level 20 knight ready for adventure, fun and loot but i am greeted with a world the feels empty now. I am going to be one of those people who said the game was better when Wild Shadow ran it. I look back at all my hours on the steam version and the kongreate version and think of how many times i would rage but get over it and roll a new character. It makes me sad inside. It was fine the way it was going but i don't understand why Kabam had to put in MicroTransactions.... I personally made the mistake of putting money into this game once and i lose it by some 8/8 dragging mobs everywhere (my fault i know) but it made me think. I wasn't mad that i lost the gear. I was mad because i didn't earn that gear i just clicked a button... This is what ruined this game the most for me. I know i am probably going to come back to this game from time to time but it will never be the same. At one point only one of my friends were playing and they had all played 200 hours.... I was the first to quit and it still annoys me. One of my greatest memories were me and my friends would meet up in the guild hall that we spend way to long in and open up a Candy Land. Respawnable Bosses and the shot at the rare Candy Coated Armor... We were drooling over this amazing piece of armor and we ran this dungeon hours upon hours non stop. That was one of the best memories.. I never got cc armor in the end but still. The best part. but now you rarely see my friends having fun in this game. They go in. Farm for 2-3 hours or more and then slowly all quit to play the next day. We still laugh occasionaly but when were all levely it feels like a drag.... To put it better it feels like a chore. In the end we just get a level 20 to power level us and still then we don't have any fun.... It brought many friends together and now we just don't meet up to play a game anymore...  This game just wont cut it anymore and i will only log on every now and then untill i lose my next character but then i think im done.. This game feels slow and boring. Sorry Kabam but you have let us down.  (I know you probably wont even read this rant)",

This is a hard game if you do not pay for tops but so is other games if you play legit. It's a good Action RPG. I find it still fun to play and do things with my friends and guilds. Don't excpet kabam to listen to you though, they are money driven and they will most likely NEVER take down the tops from nexus. Also pets are a good replacement for Ammy's even though if you can get a really good one you will almost never die. I find the pets more of a pay to win because if you feed your pet super good stuff and get a ledgendary heal, magic heal, electric pet then your set and you will almost never die. Ofcouse you can't just be a level one in god lands and with a really good pet and run into all the shots and except to be fine. The dungeons in this game are pretty fun and it is ever more fun with friends to do them with. I know some of the dungeons in this game are really lazyily made and rushed but dungeons like the shatters, or puppet therter are creative. To sum this up I will say play it if you want to, there will be a good challenge for new players (and old) and it will make you strive for perfection. This game also takes a lot of patients so if your not good at waiting then don't get this game. In this game you want to get loot - max character - get white star - don't die. You have to take risks in this game or else you will never be able to get loot and get better. Perma death can be hard and that makes this game so addictive, you want to never die again and repeat. In total get the game, try it for your self and see if you like it. (It's free so why not try it)",

The only Complaint I probably have are Players and the Horrible Lack of Def that you can have: With the Def it seems almost IMPOSSIBLE to get any Def Pots, and not getting a Point or two for Def when you level up, isn't really helping either, I would've TOTALLY kept my Hunter EXCEPT for the fact that I only had like 19 Def.  And the Players, oy! They always try coming in on you and trying to killing everything before you cause they think they get all the Exp... Um, WRONG! This game is supposed to be a Team effort not to see who can be a huge show off, and they always try to take stuff they don't even need just so you can't have it... but remember guys, PURPLE BAGS! Remember: If a Purple Bag spawns, only YOU CAN see it, so that's kinda balances it out.  Other than those few things, the game is pretty much perfect, and to be honest I think the Forbidden Jungle should be considered EASIER than the Spider Den, cause to me Forbidden Jungle isn't as hard as like 30 Mini-Spiders Pelting Waves of Bullets at you, but that's just me...  Anyways, this game is one of the perfect blends of RPG, Open-World, and MMO Games you could probably find out there. Good luck and have fun!

It will tell you with no lies what this game is...  So, In this game you have several class's to choose from. But your first charater will be a wizard. This is becouse at the start of the game you only have wizard unlocked.  This game is a perma death. This simply means. When you die. That charater is gone forever all the items on that charater are gone.  You venture through endless caves. trenchs and tombs. To fight your way through millions of monsters, each one having the potential to kill you. and make the hundreads of hours you spent on the charater to build it up usless. But if you complete such areas. You will be rewarded.  This game has one hell of a loot system.  there are several 'bags' that drop from boss's/monsters. In this order from worst to best of potential loot inside of them here are the bags!  Brown, pink , Purple , blue , light blue and the king of all the bags. a White bag.   &lt;--- Final regards ---&gt;   Now I dont want to make this review giant. So im going to close it here. But what i have told you is really nothing.   Do I recomend this game?  Yes. Give it a try. Dont stop playing till u have atleast 10 hours into it. Around then you can decide if you dont like it, Or if you love it. Remember. This game is truly boring alone... Play with a friend.

That is of course, until Kabam took over.  In a far far away galaxy when Wild Shadow Studios had control over ROTMG (around 2011 jeez!), the game was a fun time waster where you could level up characters, aquire awesome loot, and just have fun with friends recking bosses. Now it's tuned into every other ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Pay-2-Win MMO out there where the devs (even though they say they care) really don't care about their player base.  The ideas are great, the execution was terrible (on Kabam's part). Many of the mechanics got changed over Kabam's greediness like that fact that you can now BUY the best items in the game (Tier 12 Weapons/Armour) in the main hub for 'gold' (100 gold=$1). So you don't even have to play the game to get good items.  'But Yell0w Waffle, deez newbs who buy weapns frm de start arent skilled like popel who played the gaem!' Aha! This is where permadeath comes in. New players will die constantly either from poor choices or from 'Kabam's Curse of the Lag' and forced to start over again, and Kabam knows this. They are trying to exploit new players into buying better equipment with real money to start the process all over again.  'But Yell0w Waffle, iF I play gaem long enouff w/o spending my mum's $$$ I can get guud wright?' Again, wrong. ROTMG only starts you with 1 character slot (you can BUY 20 or some ♥♥♥♥) and 1 vault (it's like a chest, but can only hold a measly 8 items) and there's no way to get more unless you spend real money. About a year ago Kabam said they would change their business plan and make everything accessible by using the in-game currency (known as 'fame'), but alas, ♥♥♥♥ hasn't changed.  'But Yell0w Waffle, If gaem iz bad why u play fer so lung, why u heff to be mad?' Like I said before, this game is a simple time waster. Honestly, I got really addicted to this game a while back and It was REALLY bad. I feel sorry for all those homework assignments that never got completed because of this game. I even dumped about $40 into this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (when the game was still fun) but got so frustrated because of the constant lag problems, obvious cheaters (they use special flash players and call themselves 'hackers' lel), and the neverending grind for items when you lose everything.  Realm of the Mad God is like one of those chicks you meet in middle school whose really cool to hang out with, starts to get trashy in high school, and later find out in college that she died because of heroin overdose while her 45 year old 'boy friend' kept her locked in his basement as a... you get the point.In all, ROTMG is a game I cannot recommend, not while Kabam is still in its authority.",

There are a lot of classes such as: Wizard, Archer, Knight, Rogue, Huntress, Ninja, Assassin and more but they are ALL for the unlock. There is nothing like 'buy a class' option. You unlock them. To unlock most of the classes you have to reach the 20th level in the another class or (in the later phase of game) with the second class. All of them are different. You have the markers for the bosses on your level and there is also the ORYX'S PALACE which I will not present to you because you have to see it :). There is perma death. What is it? When you die with your character, all of his (or her :3) level and items dissapear and you have to start again. For most of the players the death moment is very bad because you loose everything but it helped me a lot for lowering my stress level. The review was pretty long and I think it helped you to choose but OK, OK! DONE! DONE! D O N E ! BUT REMEMBER: ALWAYS CHOOSE YOUR OPINION AND PLAY THE GAME BY YOURSELF!",

Add to that, it's free to play and a ridiculously tiny 32mb download, there's very little reason not to give it a go. The negative reviews mainly focus on the 'pay to win' scenario that affects most F2P titles in that you can essentially buy everything without grinding for it, however since there is such an emphasis on co-op gameplay this doesn't hinder new player as much as it sounds.",

Characters and Items are really basic: There is nothing special to be found and better items are just more annoying to find and new characters just bring other abilities. There are even some classes that share the same equipment with just another ability and slightly different stats. For example: Playing Trickster and Assassin are basically the same thing, just that the Assassin can throw poison to apply a DoT Effect on the enemy and the Trickster can distract enemies with a decoy he spawns. They share the same Items and similar stats.   When you get into the endgame things dont change, you're just hunting for really rare items ,which will disappoint you with their lack of variety. They sometimes just add 5 damage to the attacks and they have a different sprite animation. Some Robes and Armors give you 1 or 2 stats aswell as some defense, but thats nothing special if you ask me. The higher tier the item is, the more attack/defense it has, thats it. Some unique items have another ability to them, but unless you're spending 10 hours straight to get them, you wont even know about them.   You can increase your characters stats buy using stat potions, which are pretty rare if you're not a dungeon slaying master at this game and its really annoying if you die after you've almost maxed out one or two stats.   My biggest problem with this game is the repetetive gameplay and the lack of variety with the items. All youre doing is holding left-click on a monster until it is dead and while doing that youre spamming 'A' and 'D' to make it miss all of it's attacks. The dungeons are decent, but its still, always the same gameplay.  I usually like farm games like these, where you have to work hard for your gear, which is the reason I spent around 1000 hours of playing Diablo 3 and Im still enjoying farming items to get something out of it. But this game just gives you another Item with a different name and sprite animation to what you already have and those dont even change your damage too much.I played this game a lot and I just dont think I should have. I had a Knight witht the best Items and 6 out of 8 stats maxed, so dont tell me I didnt get to play the endgame enough or sometime. Im not saying it's a bad game, but it's missing something for me.",

I never got that far (when it people crowded near portals to trade.Unfortunantly that died a few years ago) , but as a avid reader I loved looking at the descriptions of the  items.Why?  Because it was seeing cool seeing their story the lore. When I found out about the wiki not only did I get more knowledge but I got better at the game I really hated when players asked 'dumb' questions about the gear they got . Usually the answer was in the hover thing, but hey it was the time of GUI's and making things easier when their already easy.One of the things I did when the realm closed was sort out my inventory chose what I wanted and do a count down and drop the stuff i didn't want.Usually the gear was T3-T6/7 see this was when those teirs had value due to not every one being rich(buying gear potions, ect wasn't implemented).Then as I got better and no one cared about those teirs one of the biggest events that ever happened in the games history happened.Kabam happened I like to call the point onward from kabam owning the game the 'Dark Ages 'for all players the point where Wild Shadow anounced they were leaving the Silver Age ( many left the game due to Wild Shadow leaving the game) and the Golden Age is the point before the Silver Age. Little by little they destroyed the game with frivolous add ons (buying gear Ok I guess,No Kabam I don't want to buy your little package for halloween.) It all added up to me deciding you know what Kabam im done.I stayed because the developers that were in WS stayed now most have left ,but wait theres more! remember the time were you killed mules and many ad-bots?(I kind of liked the rich no longer being able to have that much resources though)Well you had a big flaw (many people lost there accounts) first of all if you typed you E-mail wrong you were done for 2nd of all you forgot that disposable E-mails allow for less powerfull mules(unless there is a soulbound weekend again haha) I just remembered this for about a year the wiki was gone until (they got the wiki up again yay!) recently your only alternative was a version in Mandarin? Careless on their part.So yeah Kabam was really just the worst thing to happen to this once lovely game. I really love the idea of the game but small acts have led me to Simply not recomend this game.",

It's got a charming 8-bit graphics style, a perma-death feature, and loads of fun content. That's right when you die in Realm of the Mad God you're dead for good. It's not actually a bad thing, sure you lose all of your gear and your character progress, but you never feel like the game is over for you. With numerous classes death gives you a fresh start to try something new. The gameplay is simple but addictive. You basically just run around and shoot everything in a large open world. As you gain levels you can fight tougher monsters and get better gear. There's no PVP, but rather the game encourages you to team up with people to take on the games more difficult monsters. The beauty of it is that you don't have to team up with other people if you don't want to. You can very well be a lone wolf, but the game is easier if you team up with others. The best part of this game is that you can play the game any way you want to. You can choose if you want to max out one character class, or you can stick with the class just long enough to unlock another one. You can play for hours at a time or just in short bursts. It's simple, addictive, and very accessible. The only real complaint I have is the lack of friendly players. So far most of the people I've come across are only interested in talking to you if you have something to offer them. In the end though I'm completely addicted to Realm of the Mad God. It's tons of fun and truly free to play outside of micro-transactions. So if your looking for a fun experience and are strapped for cash, or just love fun games, check of Realm of the Mad God.",

Gameplay: enemies shooting 'projectiles' at you, swords shoots short to long beam, as you go through further levels, you see eruptions, fireworks and possibly spam galore. Different class have different ability that would help you overcome this, so take your time to discover your favourite class role while dying countlessly from pixelated shenanigans that make you rage hard.  Cashery: Permadeath element is the main catch of this game, you lost levels, items and gears upon dying. (not pet though) Although there are several spend-real-cash functions that could aid players easily in overcoming this element, it is highly advised that player spend their cash at the right thing carefully. Microtransaction are expected but effort matters more here, if you simply start with full gear of OP level stuff with real cash you'll just lose all of it permanently if you die, which seems fair to me given the choice to NOT HAVE TO BUY IT and still plays  Specs: -Window 10, 1.5GB core processor (Yes, a working laptop) -72-108MBps connection speed Summary: There is no issue, so that can be a Pro's, unless you encountered a spawner that spawns unlimited number of minion hordes that flood the map and start crashing your screen with humanity's worst nightmare. Still lags.  Community: -A dog eat dog world where low/med tier items are limited sharing (high tier items have bagloot that can only be seen by only 1 player that deserves it) -Questing are easier in a group, unless your distance from the monster killed is too far, some bosses that requires termendous amount of time to kill might be in vain after you and your team killed it (some may not even drop a loot! common bug). -random stranger passingby/teleporting towards you may cause enemy formation to change and kills you unexpectedly, AND THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO TO STOP THEM FROM TELEPORTING.  Pros: -low-spec requirement game with smooth gameplay, still lags. -Your effort actually matters -Permadeath gives you your best entertainment in this game as a form of thrill -'Bullet dodging is a skillz', so be sure to have a stiff neck after a day's hardwork. -Simple gameplay, yes, dodge and shoot.  Cons: -most spec would usually have this issue, keyboard commands override your movement if you hold movement key for too long. (can't break/character keeps moving even if you let go of your keys) -A single spike in the game from a 3rd party program can kill you. -In my perspective 'some' features should be implemented freely partially instead of being COMPLETELY a part of microtransaction -bots and hackers, they're everywhere of course, but the level here is quite moderate. -lag knows no boundary.  6/10 Would spam that F and R button with(or to abandon) friends.",

But as you play, as you collect items, fight new monsters, meet new players, make friends, and, inevitably, die, you'll notice how good this game truly is. I've died in the most stupidest of ways, and all because of my stupid decisions, I've lost super OP weapons and gear and I have raged. Oh dear, the amount of rage.   But in the end, its a really good game. 10/10",

It now time to fame farm, there's a trip to the 'God lands' is in order. You better be geared up or get to it.   This all relies on one thing..... You having made it this far of course. There is so much potential for death, with death comes boundless rage and the realization of how much time you have just wasted.

I strongly reccomend this game to anyone who likes high risk/high reward playstyles or just having fun with freinds. There is so much to do and master in this game, that it's incredible that it is so simple at the same time. All the classes have a unique role, (accomplished by individual stat caps as much as the unique ablities so this is less prevalant at lower levels) and are geared toward encouraging teamwork. As a result, the community for this game is one of the best ive ever seen. Trading is structured, massive and diverse. Trolls and toxic people are few and far between. The third party site  Realmeye.com  which also hosts the wiki is even more condusive to this. There are many dungeons for low, mid, and high tier players that all have unique themes and required playstyles to them, many of them hosting epic and challenging bosses that reward players with unique loot and garuenteed valuable drops. It has very revcently gone under new ownership and lots of new content is on the way. To be honest there are a few pay-to-win feautres in this game, but that will only get you so far. There is a certain element of skill and expeirence required to really excel (only a little bit needed to have fun), and therefore those bought out charecters in a noob's hands WONT outdo everyone free to play who are around them, but instead will most likely perish. I won't lie, there is something a little broken in this game, the pet system. Pets in this game can be super powerful, and to get them from a medium to their maximum extrodinary strength requires spending some cash or MAJOR dedication and grinding. They are still very valuable at the medium level, because they are permannat and dont die. They still are a fun and cool/cute companions either way. All together, this is an incredible game that makes for a truely unique experience. Definitely worth taking a few hours to get into.",

A simple concept turned hardcore. The things thats different about ROTMG is that when you die you die for good (and you lose all your items). This concept makes the game challenging and makes you try hard not to die. The loot system is also really good so you feel rewarded when you almost die getting an awesome new item.  Even though you only get 1 character slot by default, the game is free and it is worth paying $20 to get the begginers pack. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

[While this often results in a demand for diabolical dungeons, perhaps a different mode may offer alternative enjoyment to these players within the game. Story/adventure, that takes the ambience of a separate experience but is intergrated enough to return rewards to the main mode. (Arena fails at this). ] -Music becomes monotonous.  [Most players leave it off, a producer can rescore unique dungeons to add more atmosphere to the game based on the environment. The music fading mechanic from such games like Ocarina of Time, a smooth transition between open field and an enemy encounter, would perfectly augment Rotmg in such cases. Event Gods, Bosses in dungeon alongside the theme. It would breathe a significant portion of passion into the game.] -Some hackers play the game with advantageous modifications. [This is out of anyone's control, and is taken action against recently. A '/report' option would be appreciated so the players can assist the developers to keep an eye on potential hackers and punish them accordingly. False reporters may deserve a similar treatment.] -Golems in the Godlands are just annoying. [A personal complaint.]  A side note: The mechanic of perma-death may frustrate new players.

        {
            "review_text": "Before I start with the review, I'd like to make it clear that although I'm not the best player, I have been playing for nearly four years. The time does not show up on my steam profile because the game was originally a flash game, and my account is linked to that, not Steam.   Basic Info:  Realm of the Mad God (Rotmg for short) is a top-down pixelized roguelike rpg. A bit of a mouthful but I think that covers it. The main bulk of the gameplay comes from entering 'realms' in order to fight the monsters within them alongside your fellow players. As you progress the monsters you encounter will become more difficult until you're fighting alongside the pros in the toughest areas and dungeons. Seperate to the realms, there are many elite groups who choose to split themselves from the rest and take on the toughest challenges in small parties. And other still choose to live a tradesmen's life and devote much of their time to buying and selling items (although trading in rotmg is usually so that combat is made easier for the marketer).   Combat and Gear:  Rotmg has 14 classes: each class has it's own ability and weapon types are split between class groups. Weapons and abilities are divided by tiers. Tier 0 is starter gear and Tier 13 is the best (tiered) equipment available. Seperate to the tiered items are UT (untiered) items which may be even stronger than some of the best gear OR may have unique aspects to it.  Combat is very reliant on what gear you have. If you have bad gear, you won't stand a chance against the strongest dungeons and monsters. All combat is done with left click (your primary weapon) and the spacebar (your class' ability).   Market:  Believe it or not, the trading system in this game (although primitive) is the base for a very sophisticated market. Prices are dynamic and based on what is high in demand, and almost everything is tradeable. There are dedicated 'trading servers' where the bulk of the hubworld (the Nexus) is filled with people advertising their wares with speech bubbles. FOr most players, combat alone won't get you through to the late-game; you'll need a good share of trading ability to succeed.  Late Game:  Since this is a more general description of what you can find in Rotmg, I'll be skimming over some things like the dungeon system and guilds since they work exactly like you think they would.  After grinding monsters and slowly raising your stats, you'll be practically invincible. Invicible to everything except the strongest monsters. As a skilled character with maxed stats, you would be joining the most grueling dungeons in order to hunt loot so rare that it rivals the strength of the strongest tiered loot. The late game phase of Rotmg is considered by many to really be the beginning of the game, with everything else just being preperation. This may deter you from the game if you aren't patient (fair warning!).  The not so good stuff:  - This game is a roguelike, so upon death you will lose everything on the character you died with. All the stats you've put into it and all the gear it had will be gone. This is a huge turn off to the game if you are still unskilled and are prone to dying.  - Rotmg used to be owned by Kabam, who promptly turned it into a pay2win by putting the rarest items on sale (at a very high price) for premium currency (gold).  - Spambots are prevalent in the game and it can be difficult to shut them up unless you filter your chat. Otherwise, the chat function becomes moot.  - Rarer loot is very difficult to obtain due to low drop rates and relative difficulty to obtain in relation to character strength.  Final rating: 8/10  It's very difficult to compare this game to triple a titles and the like, but it is definitely one of the best games in it's genre. The gameplay is addicting and the risk of permadeath adds to the exhiliration. The co-op is tremendously fun and the difficulty will put your skills as a player to the test, but provide very worthwhile rewards.",

My IRL friends tapered off and I found a guild and and a fantastic experience for about a year. I eventually got bored of the game, and came back after multiple months. As it turns out, everyone I knew had basically quit. I played for a bit longer, but I already had 5 6/8s on the account, wasn't going to buy more slots, and just had to start dropping my pots to the public.  Pros - Enjoyable for an hour every once in a while  Cons - Really easy to max characters. Once you max, there's not much to do but spend money on slots. Untiered (rare drops) items from bosses are untradable (there was a time when you could trade soulbounds; it was wonderful). Large amounts of the community currently are really bad at the game.

If they were doing that then this game would be a real cash grab.  2) Don't mind my hours in this game because I play using adobe flash player with the .swf link. Within the past 2 years I have been playing 3+ hours EVERY DAY. Also all of you complaining about lag. Adobe Flash hardly every lags at all (only on US West servers nexus due to trading bots and swarms of traders)  3) Hacking IS NOT DEATHPROOF most of those *invincibility* hacks are because of your lag. There are some hackers who no-clip, autonexus, etc, however (after observing them for quite a while) no-clippers tend to disconnect after no-clipping too much (making them lose all their loot) and the autonexus does not protect against death. A good player WILL DEFINITELY be able to match the autonexus ability. The only hack I feel like is completely unbalanced is the Anti-Debuff hack.  4) All of you guys who think this is a pay to advance. IT IS NOT! All dungeons are complete able if you put enough time into it. Example, Assuming that you have breached the tier 6 boundary for your sword and the tier 7 boundary for your armor (both VERY easy to do) complete a snake pit dungeon to level up to level 10-15 ish then use the speed from the boss to buy you a dragonsoul sword (T9) from someone else. Then do another snake pit to buy yourself a desolation armor (T10). These items (and some skill) makes an abyss moderate-challenging to do but still very complete able. Then collect the def from the boss and buy yourself an archon sword(T10). From the archon and vengance armor up, your best chance at getting better loot is at oryx, however if you stay with the big mob getting through the dungeon is pretty easy.  So there you have it. Realm is not some type of cash grab, everything is obtainable through a little effort. I hope you realize that realm HAS given players free character slots, portal keys, etc before.",

So if you tend to get mad over dying and losing your gear especially when starting this game is not for you--- ---Lots of cheaters--- ---You CAN buy gear/pet eggs/ other items that will boost you over other players so a tad bit pay 2 win BUT note first con--- ---If you're a loot hoarder and dont have money to spend this game is not for you since you only start off with one chest in your vault and more chests can ONLY be purchased with in game currency--- ---Sometimes hard to get loot if you're starting out since other people with better gear will out DPS you and usually kill the mobs before you get the chance to do the specified amount of damage---  Thats all I can think of for the moment so that will be the end of the review.

They make this game have a unique aspect because of their rarity, and when you get one you feel amazing. Some are more rare than others because of the dungeon rarity or just the random number generator. For example, The Crown of the Forgotton King is one of the most rare white bags only because of how difficult it is to get to the boss that drops it. Another example is the Wand of the Bulwark, which drops from one of the most common and easy to complete dungeons in the game! The only reason it is rare is because of the random number generator being so low on this weapon. This is my favorite reason for playing Realm of the Mad God, and I give this game a positive review.",

The second mode would be Normal where loot is dropped on death, this way you have a chance of getting to it, but other players can steal it if you dont return to it in 1 minute. The final difficulty would be Hard Mode Gods and Bosses are harded, but higher loot chance drop. Bringing white bags from 1 in Decazilloin chances of dropping to 1 and a 719 chance!(P.S I got my first white bag esterday from a Sprite God Nearly popped my pants!)

But soloing a pentaract and getting nothing or duoing other events such as a cube or skull shrine and not getting anything is alittle disheartening.   -Chests from bosses is the worst idea ever I will admit to crying about this, because it really is a terrible idea, it favors certain classes, and takes away from the reward to players who actually fought the boss.  -Paralyze pets are dumb   -Load error... retrying  -And I'm sure plenty of people want UTs to be tradeable again  NOW THAT IM DONE ♥♥♥♥♥ING  -The game is very fun and replayable  -Very good pick up and go if you need something to do for 5 minutes or hours on end  -Decent game to play with friends -Simple to play pretty straight forward shoot ♥♥♥♥ don't get shot  So there are some basic points about the game, I'm excited to see what Deca has to offer. o/",

            "review_text": "This game. A New dev got the game once again. A company called DECA games working to make this game last another decade. For the week or so they have been working on the game they have been involved with fans ALOT more than the previous company. As one of there community challenges they wanted 200 new steam reviews positive or negative there looking for community feedback so heres the review.  Negatives  When you first get into the hub of the game (The nexus) after the tutorial what do you see? Depending on your server you see spambots some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ betting thing and trading.  (trading usually has 2 different servers 1 more popular then the other) (trading is great not part of the negatives) Then while looking around u can buy what looks like the best gear this looks p2w from the start it really does, I dont like see new players spending there money and losing it because they think there invinsible with the 'best gear' aswell as the pets ive seen countless amount of people that bought TERRIBLE eggs for there pets for like 20$ its really not new player friendly. But then theres the actual pay to win part of the game. You can pay for a max pet (yes itll be expensive really expensive) and it makes you SO much stronger, stronger then anything can in the game. (not gonna describe how to do so cuz i think its a negative part of the game).   Bugs/Cheaters There are so many people that cheat that can auto nexus  (auto nexus is a thing were when somebody gets low it brings them to the save hub any player can teleport to the safe hub at anytime but you have to click a button to do so this automatically does it for them I think depending on how low there hp gets)  aimbot (there client or whatever aims for them)  or take away negative status affects (blind drunk whatever ect ect) (oh also theres no clip but thats not super important only time i see that is in a low level dungeon)  it really annoying to be a legit player and die when there are players clearly worse then you but with rarer gear just because there cheating and cant die. There is also something even worse that completly ruins the game its multiboxers. Now if you dont know what a multiboxer ill explain it a multiboxer is pretty much somebody playing as 5 charcters at once but only having to control 1 (I dont really know how it works but thats what it seems to be) now the problem with this is there is soulbound chance in the game this determines who gets loot. some dungeons only 3 people get loot most of the time and when theres 5 people there and u there theyll most likley steal all the loot and waste all your time. Most the players (from my understanding) buy all there accounts that dont have names so they have the best gear and its hard to ban them(so far deca is trying to ban them which is 1 million times better then the last company) and also cheat on top of having 5 charcters. Another huge problem is ent sitting and avatar sitting. This is a thing were somebody does a bug or glitch or cheats and sits ontop of an enemy without taking damage and saying tp theres this dungeon here the people tp and die instantly.  Positives. This game is amazing just look at my hours im bias i play the game even with all the negatives i wrote because of how good the positives are.  I dont know how to explain this to somebody that hasnt played the game.  But the way loot drops the way you max your stats and way rushing dungeons work are all amazing in this game.anyone that has played this game knows how amazing it is to finally have gotten that white bag that you have been farming and farming and farming and farming and farming to get then maxing that charcter getting a good skin for that charcter its just cool i dont know why its so fun it feels like such a big accomplishment to get this gear without dieing on a charcter being able to live THAT LONG and keep that gear and maxing that classes stat is so much fun. Then the frustration of dieing on that charcter sucks but its just part of the game its really the best and most frustrating part about the game. The community in this game is amazing piffle the reddit realmeye all the spriters and dungeon makers even tho i never played nillys realm they love the game all these people made content want to make content want to be part of the community and love the game (also youtubers lol)  Things id love to see.  Get rid of the cheaters obviously the spam botters the betting the multis the ent sitting. Id love to see a way to reduce lag when there are alot of people there maybe being able to turn off other peoples shots and just be able to see there animations. Stack shots id love for those to be gone its so frustrating to dodge into a shot that looks like itll do 80 damage to you then one shot you because there shots stacked ontop of eachother. ID LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE FOR NEW CONTENT PLEASE. Ive been waiting for new content for years shatters is not fun it relys on people being there its a pain to solo theres stack shots. Some of the chests are TERRIBLE in this game the puppet dungeon drops loot for like 1 person same with the ice cave. Get rid of the tiered items in the nexus there way to overpriced there not that good there not user friendly if anyone is thinking about buying one of them litterally just buy a tomb instead post a trade on realm eye selling your tomb for 3L and find a trustworthy person to open it for then just buy a top for your life its cheaper and you get more out of it plus your helping somebody else. MAKE KEYS TRADEABLE People get scammed all the time trying to sell keys the only problem would be duping which i think you guys fixed &lt;3 deca Ut tradable idk how you would do this but if you could somehow make all the uts that have been gotten non tradable then make all the current ones that have been tradable that would be amazing.

You level up by killing monsters. Monsters can drop dungeons, where you can get stat potions that increase your stats.   Their are multiple characters you can unlock. You only start out with one, but you can unlock up to 20.   It takes a lot of skill to be able to survive and get an 8/8 character, but it is really worth it to show off your skills.  Their is a pet system that Is really nice to aid you in combat. Pet eggs have a chance of dropping on gods where you can then hatch and use. Their are different levels of pets common, uncommon, rare, legendary, and divine. It will take you years to get a divine pet without paying money. This game is pay 2 win, but be careful because if you don't have skill your money will go down the drain.   This game is really fun and satisfying to learn and become good at.

While this is an awesome game, there are a few things that I don't like:  * It's not very new-player friendly. You're given one character slot, and one vault. This almost forces you to spend money to play the game, as having only one character and vault makes the game almost impossible to play.  * While there are a lot of items, there isn't much diversity in the different sets of gear you have. You can't have one set of gear on your Knight that is specifically used for one thing, and have another set of items for another task. Adding more items that bring diversity to classes would be amazing.  * The classes. While there are quite a few classes, someone like me who has played for awhile gets bored of the classes. A lot of the classes are very similar to other classes, making the choices for different play styles even smaller.   * Dungeons. We need harder dungeons that require more multiplayer. The Shatters dungeon was a great start, and the Epic dungeons are amazing. Maybe doing something like Legendary dungeons would make the game more interesting. I personally would love to see an upgraded version of the Haunted Cemetery.  * Guilds. Guilds are pretty useless. They do nothing, and have no purpose. The only thing I use the guild hall for is opening dungeons for my guild mates, which could easily be done either in a Bazaar, or in a dungeon in a realm. I love the idea of Guild realms, but I know that would be a strain on the servers, and cause the game to be very laggy.   * Community. My last complaint. Most of the players of this game are toxic, and do nothing but talk trash and drag enemies to try and kill you. I'm pretty sure this is a thing already, but if you have proof of someone dragging, that player should be banned. Temp muting should also be introduced and be executed by in-game moderators/staff for those who harass others.",

The goal is to get the best gear you can, drink stat potions that increase attack, defence, health, mana, and other things!

If you do stick around, you will make new friends, and will enjoy it, get mad at it, but have lots of fun!  -----------------  You can play it on a browser as well as steam, which is why I have so little play time, as the steam version has had some issues in the past.",

And to write this article im using steams web site.)Hello! Deca Games. This is going to be my review on Realm of the Mad God. Before I start with anything I would like to say my ign is Davicee, that being said lets start with the review. The first thing I would like to say is how I like the bullet hell style. It makes it so you have to deal a lot of damage while also watching your back because if not you might die. I also like the chance of getting a drop in dungeons, If im doing an abyss and I get a lot of damage in I'm not guaranteed drop although what I do wish is that you guys add loot drops for everyone. Because not all new plays are going to be able to get damage in and if there in a dungeon with much stronger people then the odds of them getting anything is off the charts. Last thing I would like to address is how the perma death works. I like the fact that when you die you lose your character, sure it sucks when you lose everything but that's the point of the game. Its like a constant wager with you against the enemy so if you mess up then you can die and lose all your stuff. Imagine realm without perma death. You would get so much loot and not lose it if you die so there wouldn't even be a point in playing the game.  To end it off here I will like to say how realm is a great game and I think it is even better now that you guys (deca games) has taken over. That being said hope you enjoy my review on realm of the mad god. I would give this game a 8.5-9/10",

Wildshadow had been a good company, helping users and constantly updating the game. When Wildshadow couldn't support the game, they sold it to.... you guessed it, Kabam.   Kabam, is one of my least favorite companies, because they never update the game, and never try to stop the hackers and multi-boxers. I could go on and on, but recently, Kabam has made a choice to sell RotMG to a company called GAEA.  Now GAEA, I have never heard of, but their games seem very good, have good reviews, and I personally hope they can bring RotMG back from the grave and have players re-unite.  All in all, RotMG used to be a ♥♥♥♥ game, but! A new developer may make the game more playable.  The game has become amazing due to Deca. The game has never been as good as before, and so many people are now playing due to all the changes, ty Deca!",

Strutting around with that new special item is great but the despairing/frustrated feeling of a character dying or meeting a cancerous tumour in game is just as strong.  I recommend spending a few bucks on buying one or two more character slots and a couple of vaults- don't treat it as F2P. The money you spend on it will allow you to maximise enjoyment without spending hours grinding and despairing over Kabam's $$$ grabbing schemes.  The community is not the greatest- this game is basically USA-capitalist simulator- but there are still those that play for fun. If you find a group of buddies to play with (voice chat of some sort is nice) or don't mind ignoring everyone then it's a solid game. Worth playing but not worth the time spent on it (VERY ADDICTIVE).",

Cons -Got rid of buying items with fame -Enemies get repetitve -Game needs some new dungeons or enemies to make the game less repetitive -Vault and Character slots cost are to expensive not everybody has the money to buy coins to get vault space and character slots especially for the people who play this game a lot but only have 2 or 3 character slots and only 2 chest open in the vault. -The Dev's need to start cracking down on Multiboxers and hackers because I see them everywhere -You need to make it to where you can loot graves again!
