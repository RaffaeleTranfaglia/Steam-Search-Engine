            "review_text": "Imagine the hacking minigame from Bioshock, except that you rotate existing tiles instead of placing existing ones. Also imagine that you control Frogger, who hand-rotates these tiles while listening to techno and dodging traffic on a highway.  If you dismiss indie games as being EITHER fast, tough-as-nails platformers OR artsy atmospheric environments, I highly encourage you to give this game a shot - this is a fine example of original gameplay that requires split-second precision and risk/reward decision making. I had beaten (not gold-medalled) the single-player campaign in about 4 hours, but don't take that as a knock against the game - I preferred to play in 10-minute intervals to give my nerves a chance to recover from the frantic pace, and I haven't played much of the other modes yet.  The soundtrack by Ian Hicks is extremely well done - 7 tracks that nicely complement the setting and gameplay that are well worth purchasing and adding to your mp3 player. The 8th, which is used in the trailer, feels out of place and I've removed it from my playlist. Recommended.  Speed and precision required: Yes  Straightforward 100%: No  Soundtrack format: DLC, mp3",

            "review_text": "A Virus Named TOM is a puzzle game, where you play as a virus trying to bring down a Jetsons-style 'City of Tomorrow'. You do this by connecting all of the lines to the source of the infection.  The game is very well made in almost every aspect. The puzzles are challenging, and require a combination of skillful maneuvering and careful planning. The game continues introducing a bunch of new elements as you play, taking time to introduce each, and it demonstrated the game's depth and its finesse in how it introduces each. The style of the game is really neat. I adored the game's art, and I laughed a few times at the humorous story.  This game has local multiplayer, both cooperative and competitive, which is something you don't see that often anymore. On top of that, it's pretty fun.  I hadn't heard much about this game before getting it, which is sad, because more people need to hear about A Virus Named TOM. This game is excellent, and it deserves a place among the best indie games.",

The primary gameplay is rotating circuitry around to pass power from one end of the board to the other, and completing this task as fast as possible. While this is not exactly a novel game concept, the presentation is nice and there are some interesting twists in the mechanics later into the game.  However all that being said, I personally was not all that enthused by the game, so if a friend were to ask me for a recommendation, this title would not be one of them. It's a great little puzzle game, just not for me.",

Con's:  - Short story mode. (Nothing to do alone after you completed it) - Co-op is apparently only available on a single computer (up to 3 gamepads + keyboard).  All in all, this game's a 3/5 from me, only because of the short single-player possibilities. I'd reccomend only if it's either bundled or on a big sale and you really don't know what else to enjoy.",

Unfortunately I can't give it good marks for escapism.  As a minigame within a larger, deeper and more compelling world, this would be PERFECT. Its mechanics are complex enough to warrant a bunch of tries and is rewarding enough to not be a consistent 'gonad-blocker' for whatever it may be used for in such a case. I would much prefer this for a hacking minigame instead of what comes as standard with say, Deus Ex: Human Revolution.

            "review_text": "Disclaimer: I haven't played the Multiplayer element of the game and my review is only reflective of the single player experience.   I decided to play this game after it had been in my library for almost a year from a Humble Bundle I had purchased. I thought it would at least keep my attention for a while as it was classified as a puzzle game, but to my dismay it wasn't really a puzzle game overall.   The game is mostly a twitch/reaction game with some puzzle elements. The game takes its roots in the genre Pipe Mania made popular. You have to move circuit pieces around so that you have a complete circuit/flow of the virus and the level is complete. You may ask 'But isn't that a puzzle game?' and to that question I would say it is a puzzle game.The last half of the game it introduces too many elements for it to remain a puzzle game. The later elements all rely on the player moving quickly and trying to think on their toes and often that leads to death. A good puzzle game gives the player time to do the puzzles and doesn't require ADHD levels of movement while still trying to solve a puzzle.   Many design choices made in the game are inherently flawed. After you complete a level it takes you back to the main board to select a level wherein you will often find that you have to move around a couple times to get to the next level. I would have liked to see the game progress you to the next level after a level is completed. My next issue is with the music. There felt like there were 3 tracks of music that were randomly selected at the start of a level. I would have liked to have seen a couple tracks for each world and I would have liked it if the music didn't change every single time I had to restart a level. The sound effects are some of the most nerve-wracking I have heard in a while that I ended up just disabling sound to play the game.  Overall the game is an 'Okay' experience but I know for sure that I will not play it anymore. It's not worth $10 and has the same amount of content I would expect from a $3 mobile app. I'd have to say to all my friends to give this game a pass as there are plenty of other games you can get that are better for the same price point.",

            "review_text": "This game is a puzzle game. Except, the puzzles aren't difficult, just time consuming. But it has enemies, so it's sort of an action game! Except the enemies are predictable, and being hit by one only serves to reduce the time remaining that you have to solve the particular puzzle until you 'run out of energy'. At which point you need to start the 'puzzle' over again. This game then quickly devolves into two kinds of levels:  1. Long and boring puzzle levels where enemies are hardly a threat, and sometimes pieces of the puzzle are obscured so you either have to rely on memorization or gueswork.  2. Insultingly simple puzzles that are only made 'difficult' by a pointless overabundance of enemies, which, due to the fact that you are limited by a grid, are impossible to dodge unless you literally wait for the perfect timing, jump in, rotate pieces of the puzzle, and jump out before you get hit and waste your time.  Wasting your time is the name of the game, here. This game is not a puzzle game, nor an action game, nor a game in any sense of the word. It is a time waster, in the purest sense. Buying it is, predictably, a waste of time.",

It's kind of hard to be original when your core gameplay is used in like every hacking minigame ever.  Programmer B: I've got it! Let's hide the pieces until they've got flow in them! That'll make it harder!  Programmer A: Hide the pieces? Brilliant! Let's make a puzzle game that relies on trial and error as a primary mechanic!  Programmer B: Yes!

It also features a fun story/theme and decent writing.  Unfortunately, many of the mechanics the game throws at you are just plain Not Fun to play with. Starting just a few levels in, the game adds invisible pipes. You can't actually plan things out now - you just have to rotate each piece, one by one, until you've got them all connected with the water source. Then you can see you were rotating them all wrong and have to start over. And did I mention there's a timer? And enemies that take away your time? Be prepared to restart the level a lot. Does this sound like a fun puzzle game to you?  There's challenging, which is fine, and there's obnoxious. The developers of AVN TOM don't seem to appreciate the difference. Not being able to see your pieces in a puzzle game isn't difficult, it's just frustrating and tedious. I made it to the fourth (of six) world before just giving up, because the hidden pipes are a constant mechanic that rarely goes away.",

            "review_text": "One day it would be so great to go up to Hideo Kojima, the creator of the Metal Gear games and say to him about A Virus Named TOM, ''Sir, you have created a game that is both original and good. Sadly the parts that are good are not original and the parts that are original are not good.''  Harsh? I don’t think so. A Virus Named TOM is a massively overrated game. Although it breaks new ground in it fantastic graphic and superb sound, its gameplay is often badly flawed and plotwise is almost laughable in its political naivety and Z-grade writing. But before we get started here is the obligatory information stuff that all reviews must contain by law in case you have never heard of this game before.  A Virus Named TOM is a game that probably needs no introduction, but here is one anyway. It was released in 1999 by Konami on the Playstation and updated into three dimensions the adventures of Solid Snake a covert operative from the group Fox Hound. Previous adventures on the NES and MSX were fairly basic but innovative stealth action games were going in with all guns blazing was not the sensible option. The PlayStation incarnation saw Solid Snake being sent to a base in Alaska where former members of Fox Hound have taken control of a huge robot called Metal Gear Rex and its Snakes job to defeat them and return control of Rex. Unusually for such a console style game, it was also released for the PC a year later to a fairly muted reception.  You are supported by various helpful people via a radio in your ear called your Codec. This allows you to ask advice, gain info and save your game. Controls wise you action is viewed from a top down third person viewpoint that can be switched to first person (static) view for looking around in detail. Support items such as infrared goggles, cardboard boxes etc are kept on one side of the screen and weapons such as the Socom and Nikita on the other. One can be assigned to each and as you progress through the game you collect a fearsome arsenal. Each type of weapon is effective against certain Bosses, for example Sniper Wolf needs to be taken out with a sniper rifle, the Nikita Launcher needs to be used versus Liquid Snake and his helicopter. Your main tactic is to sneak about, sneaking everywhere is the key. You rarely need weapons unless you are in a boss battle. The elegant controls give you a wide range of crawling, sliding, ducking options.  The graphics and sound are beautiful on the lowly PlayStation, despite the colour palette being heavy on the greens and greys it was still a stunning achievement from the little grey box. Breath clouds in the cold. However the voice acting is still far superior to most of what has gone before or since. The plot forms a huge part of the game with long discussions and cut scenes cropping up at regular intervals. With its strong anti-war message the game is often preachy and unsubtle in it's ''fighting's bad mmkay'' proletising and considering the overall content of the game one of the rankest pieces of hypocrisy ever to be committed to any medium.  So what’s wrong then? Well lots. For a start, the much vaunted stealth aspects of the game are not as original as many would have you believe. the first NES games may have included stealth elements for the first time in gaming but the way they have been implemented in AVNT are much more reminiscent of N64 game Goldeneye and the superb ninja stealth game Tenchu. But whereas in those games enemies could spot you from a great distance and if a surveillance camera spied you, it was pretty much mission over, in AVNT its just plain dumb. For example if you are spotted by a camera or guard you only have to avoid them for about ten seconds before they get bored and go back to patrolling. EH??? And for some reason these genetically modified genome soldiers can only see ten feet in front of them. Stay out of range using your handy radar and you can run right in front of them and not be seen. Ridiculous.  In the same vein, the super bad bosses who are so much tougher than you, all seem to have very low IQs. They happily pause and show you a weak spot for you to hit, and as you spend four hours wearing their health down, they will refuse to change tactics, which is nice. Its also in a blatant attempt to make the game seem bigger, much backtracking to unlock doors early on in the game using key cards obtained later on. There are also some terrible attempts to introduce postmodernism into videogames. That means a cultural text that acknowledges it is a work of fiction by addressing the reader/viewer/player. In this case, its demanding you remove the controller in a boss fight, having Psycho Mantis read your memory card and Snake referring to the vibration of the controller to sooth his poor, sore arm. This struck me at the time as a rather odd thing to do, when so much of the game is supposedly geared to sucking you into its story. to suddenly bring you up short by yelling ''hey this is a game yah know!'' seems to be very strange and schizophrenic.  Where A Virus Named TOM tries to break new ground is via its storyline. It tries to present itself as quite radical in its condemnation of war, fighting and the effects on the human spirit. Yes, that’s very nice, but the constant whining of Solid Snake about how bad his lot is and how Meryl shouldn't want to be a solider is not great, just grating. Especially when you have a bajillion items to commit all kinds of murder in your possession and can strangle and break guards necks with your bare hands. Also by the end the plot seems have careered off at various bizarre tangents. What started out as an interesting tale about political intrigue and genetic experimentation has turned into some kind of idiotic farce. Every other person turns out to be a traitor, and the great threat turns out to be a big robot that can fire missiles off its shoulders or something equally stupid.  Perhaps its worst fault is its moronic vision of global politics. The world we live in is not ever likely to be threatened by super enhanced terrorists using a giant robot to launch nukes. To even try and present it seriously (with footage from global conflicts and Hiroshima amongst others) is an affront. As we have always been shown, if terrorist want to hurt us they attack out basic freedoms by targeting our transport, leisure and centre's of commerce. What irritates the hell out of me about AVNT and the like is the stultifying effect it has on the minds of players who sink into a kind of apathy about world affairs, always assuming there is a quick and violent solution to the deep, protracted, long-term problems of this sick world we live in.  A Virus Named TOM is a lovely game to look at and makes nice noises. But if you really listen to it and probe what its trying to say you’ll find its nothing more than primary school politics, with a moral message delivered with all the subtlety of a brick in the face. Its stealth-based gameplay is badly flawed and has been done better elsewhere, both before and since. Snake is possibly one of the most tediously self-centred “heroes” ever to appear in a videogame and to cap it all, the villain, Liquid Snake has an English accent(!). Oh Hideo, stick to the Mech games you obviously really want to be making, this Snake needs a mongoose to put it (and us) out of its misery.",

But, I shrugged it off. It was the tutorial after all. While playing the second level, I just got frustrated by the repitition. New elements added to the gameplay don't spice it up, they just make it frustrating. The puzzles aren't fun, either. They're just more of the same every time.",

Bundled with multiplayer potential and minor puzzle solving elements, AVNT attempts to breathe life into what was already a stressed-for-fun style. It succeeds, though only barely. The puzzle solving is ingenuitive at first, and irritating mere minutes later. TL:DR = Don't waste your time or money. Average at best isn't worth either.",
