Incredibly Great Game!!  Edit: WTF with the Hotdogs... Please tune them to not be so twitchy..  Edit 2: Dev fixed them!! Thanks for the Quick Response!! Again, just wanted to say I *REALLY* Like this game!! The Colors, the Animation.. Well done!! And to a certain clown, Just because I dont have tough games in my Steam Library (because Steam is everything kids!) doesnt mean I dont play tough games.. Dark Souls 1 &amp; 2, Armored Core Series are just to name a few.",
