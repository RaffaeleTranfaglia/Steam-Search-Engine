            "review_text": "Wolfenstein is such an odd series. The original formed part of the bedrock that first-person shooters are built upon, but then vanished as Doom, Quake, Half-life, and others grew the genre. Instead of becoming a franchise it resurfaces every decade or so, under the guidance of a different studio, to fulfil our Nazi-killing quota for a time. Now we have this generation's Wolfenstein, brought to us by Machine Games, and after blasting my way through it I can only hope it's going to stick around this time.  The New Order follows BJ Blazkowicz, a square-jawed Captain America type, as he assaults a secret Nazi stronghold in 1946. The Reich has an ace up their sleeve in the form of General Deathshead, one of those jack-of-all-mad-scientists that's good at making everything lethal. The game opens with an intense bombing run that works all the basic controls in as part of thrilling stunts, and keeps on going with combat as you hit the beachhead and start mowing down SS. There are giant robots to crush, commanders to assassinate, towers to scale, cannons to fire, and huge firefights to overcome. The battle reaches a fever pitch, the mission goes south, and you suddenly realize that was just the first chapter of a sixteen-chapter game.  Easily the best part of TNO is the incredible depth of gameplay, which is striking considering how straightforward its predecessors were. Every one of the game's chapters is different in some small way, either being more focused on stealth, or giving you a new vehicle, or arranging battles in a unique way, or just having a different pace from the rest of the hectic, brutal adventure. It's especially good about giving you breathers between intense chapters or battles, as well as plenty of opportunities to explore. Each level has dozens of secrets, not the old hump-the-walls kind but permanent health powerups or collectibles or other bonuses hidden away in logical, secluded places.  You're not just shooting and scrounging, either. There's a whole perk system that runs parallel to the game that rewards you for completing certain tasks, like getting X headshots with a specific weapon or Y kills with explosives. There are four categories of perks that are roughly divided by playstyle, so players who prefer stealth or going Rambo will accumulate perks to help them do so more effectively sooner. It's a good way to get you to change up your style, too, because TNO has so many options when it comes to fighting that you might forget some exist.  That's not an exaggeration, either. You'll find maybe half a dozen guns in the game but each one has dual wielding and a robust secondary fire mode, which can turn your assault rifle from a mid-range sniping tool to a room-clearing double rocket launcher. There's also melee combat and silent takedowns, combat slides that let you keep shooting John Woo style, a seamless cover system, and more. And none of these systems are superfluous because your enemies can be just as varied. Certain weapon types are more effective against armored targets, and the more difficult enemies might have weak points or certain sequences to defeating them.  All of this is built on a game with a strong vein of reverence for its origins, with health pickups that can overcharge you to 300+ and an endless stream of helmets you can slap on for 5 armor apiece. The base movespeed is refreshingly high, letting you run and gun as you please, or snoop around and scramble Nazi brains with your knife. It's a vicious, brutal game with dismemberment and melee kills, and plenty of terrible things will happen to the many characters you meet as well. Here the game walks a fine, featuring a story with strong emotional beats and some very grim overtones, and then has you cracking wise about killing Nazis or shoving them into toilets. It works for me, with the lighter parts almost a coping mechanism for the overarching despair, but I could see it feeling whiplashy for others.  As if that wasn't enough, The New Order is a jaw-droppingly beautiful game. Characters are rendered in cinematic detail, your weapons are hefty and bold, the scenery is meticulously crafted for both incredible vistas and personal touches, and the action is animated with expert skill. The sound design is masterful as well (especially the soundtrack, my God) and you will feel every explosion and impact as you kill your way to the incredibly finale. Your journey will take you to a dizzying variety of locales to show all of this off, including just about every secret Nazi stronghold you can imagine, each rendered and polished in its own unique style.  One playthrough should take you 10-12 hours but there's an interesting choice in the first chapter that splits the game into two timelines, each with small differences to paths taken and story beats. You can also sink plenty of time into unlocking all the perks and turning up all the collectibles if you're the completionist type. Or you can just keep killing Nazis, because Wolfenstein: The New Order makes it an exquisite pleasure. This is easily one of the top FPSes of this generation, and no matter your style of play or taste in game you owe it to yourself to give it a try.",

Just enough nostalgia (edited from the German version ... Oh I made a funny) sprinkled with that new positively charged electron smell to make is fresh and exiting.  Only played a little bit of it so far and it's definitely one of the best bug free quality releases this year.

            "review_text": "After a 5 year absence, B.J. Blazkowicz is back in Wolfenstien: The New Order, the first title from Swedish Devs - Machine Games.  Set in alternate reality 1960s Europe, Nazi Germany has won the 2nd World War, the Allied nations are in ruins and all resistance has been crushed. Or so it seems.  Mixing surrealistic humour with dark themes, WTNO treads a fine line between serious and kitsch. I personally found the story entertaining, even though plot holes abound.  Along your journey to save the world, you'll be fighting hordes of Nazi stormtroopers and robots (robo-dogs included) in open levels that are pretty unique and well desgined. (don't be put off by the 1st level's linearity, it gets better, trust me.)  Gunplay is excellent. Guns sound powerful and bullets have real impact. Enemy a.i. seems decent (played on medium diff)  Sound design is great as well, with support for up to 7.1 surround sound. Did I mention that the soundtrack is great? No? Well, it's freakin' awesome :)  Graphics aren't the best even @ high settings due to the crappy id5 engine used. However, in certain areas, the visuals look pretty damn good.  The story does drag about 3/4 to the end, but I found the ending worth pushing through it. (My 1st playthrough lasted around 15 hours give or take.)  There is no MP component, which may be a pro/con depending on your personal preference, so bear that in mind.  tldr: Highly recommended, best SP shooter I've played in quite a while.",

            "review_text": "Like a coffee gone cold, it's been easy to forget the golden age of the World War II FPS. Albeit edible, any thirsty developer approaches hesitant to the long-gone steam clouds of its hour of freshness. Back before the famed Call of Duty franchise strapped players into the combat boots of the WWII genre, the influential, genre-defining Wolfenstein 3D plotted willing adventurers into the labyrinths of a Nazi prison, with chances of survival as slim as the knife you begin with. Fictictious war hero B.J. Blazkowicz has since become a legendary icon in the realm of interactive media. It's 2014, and MachineGames has not feebly waltzed, but boldly marched back into the dated franchise, armed with a morbid, yet brilliant new concept with Wolfenstein: The New Order.  The war is over, the Nazis have won, and the future of humanity is bleak, all in exchange for Aryan supremacy. People are dying left and right under the non-chalant smiles of Nazi officers. Rudely awoken after a fourteen-year hiatus in an insane asylum, it's an understatement to say that William Blazcowicz has returned with all the bang for your buck, and then some. It's a setup that drains the hope of the world from even the optimistically devout. Depending on your gameplay preference, you may be hesitant to drop the $60 without multiplayer, but fret not. Even as a single-player exclusive experience, The New Order shines at its pacing and the satisfaction that bleeds from the gratuitous violence on the screen and cakes onto the player.  I didn't initially anticipate myself using the game's new, excessively versatile dual-wielding system, but in no time, I grew used to how surprisingly satisfying it clicked with my input. It drifts away from extreme realism and has you off of the training wheels and behind two assault rifles within minutes of play. It's like Skyrim, with, well...never mind.  Also new to Wolfenstein is a perk system, which, like its namesake, paves the way for new abilities, or 'perks' throughout the riveting campaign. While the small touches in combat are welcome, stealth leaves a lot to be desired. It's satisfying, but I believe a lot more can be done with the mechanic, especially since every stealth-related perk is a trivial achievement that involves actions you may have performed already, thus unlocked or imminently such.  Wolfenstein: The New Order will approximately clock you around 10-15 hours, or just under that if you rush. No matter how fast you complete this critter, it will definitely leave you hungry like the Wolf for more.",

            "review_text": "Wolfenstein – The New Order is the latest instalment of the Wolfenstein Franchise. I have been playing the Wolfenstein games since the Wolfenstein 3D era. Someone who liked the previous games and the game style will absolutely love this new game.  Story: As always you play 'B.J.' Blazkowicz but this time the story is set in an alternate reality. It’s 1960 and the Nazi’s won the war. The story of this game is well written and well-acted.  Game: The game is only single player, there is no multi player. But that’s a good thing so the developers good focus all their attention to the single player game. Unlike a lot of games these days where single player is neglected. It’s a fast action fps in true Wolfenstein style. Graphics and sound are impressive; it’s based on the id-tech engine (like Rage). The story unfolds via in engine cut scene’s. It’s impressive how much detail they put in the story telling. The game can graphically be tweaked a lot, there are a of options that can influence you’re fps. So it’s important to read some of the guides if you have trouble running it. I can confirm it also runs on ultra-wide screens 21:9 aspect ratio and a resolution of 2560*1080 without problems. For those who have never played the original Wolfenstein 3D – the game that started the fps-genre – level 1 is hidden somewhere in the game.  This is a must for everyone’s game collection! Highly recommended! ",

            "review_text": "What makes New Order a great entry in the Wolfenstein series is that it takes place in 1960. Blazkowicz is in a coma following a battle in 1946 and wakes up only 14 years later in an asylum and - to his surprise - notices that WW 2 ended with German victory. He sets out to find the remaining members of the resistance (people he may know from the '40s) and to unite them against an even more dangerous villain.  This setting is great; also, the prologue telling the events of 1946 is also pretty long. This time the occultism-obsessed Reich is replaced with soldiers having a lot of armor and many mechanised units such as the Panzerhund or the Stomper which is the Wolfenstein version of the AT and T from Star Wars.   Graphics-wise the game is pretty as usual thanks to the 5th iteration of the id tech engine which debuted back in 2011 in Rage. This means relatively high system requirements and 50 gigs empty space is a must. Gameplay-wise we are back to a linear shooter where you shoot first and ask questions later. Combat is fast-paced and the option to dual-wield weapons is pretty great!  Stealth gameplay is implemented, too. Sections often have a patrolling commanding officer; you know this as the game puts their signal (i.e. distance) in the upper-right corner of the screen. Here a silent approach is recommended otherwise reinforcements will keep arriving until you deal with the commander.   Regardless of which gameplay method you prefer the game gives you perks. Using all weapons and all methods you can get these that either mean you can carry more ammunition or you have better health regeneration. Beside the story-related achievements most are connected to these. As for achievements: it wouldn't be a Wolfenstein game without secrets. You collect golden items (medallions, chalices, swords etc.), health or armor upgrades, letters and enigma codes that you can open from the main menu.  Characters Blazkowich meet are great companions. In fact, at the beginning of the game you make a decision as to who to save from two of your comrades. A 2nd playthrough is a must if you'd like to see the timeline with the other comrade; interestingly, depending on who you save you complete a different minigame for opening locks (you either hotwire panels or carry out lockpicking). You often return to the hideout between missions to converse with the others and throughout the game you can find several newspaper cuttings elaborating on the events of 1946-1960.  New Order is a great shooter with a relatively long (10+ hours) campaign, great characters and an amazing story. Machine Games did a great job by picking up a classic and giving it a new, interesting story. The many cutscenes and the great characters were the items I primarily missed from Rage; Wolfenstein, however, delivers in all areas.",

            "review_text": "Wolfenstein: The New Order is a great addition to the Wolfenstein series. After a long sprint of mediocre games, Wolfenstein triumphantly returns with an excellent story-driven arcade FPS. It tends to feel a lot like playing a Bioshock game, which isn't a bad thing. With its' divergent storyline, Wolfenstein has managed to capture my attention. Fans of would-be history games will love this.   Story  It is the 1960s and the Nazis have controlled the world for quite some time now. B.J. Blazkowicz, the protagonist of the series, awakes after a head injury to find that the United States no longer exists and is determined to find a resistance. Once he does, the Resistance, led by a charasmatic woman named Caroline Becker, embarks on a quest to take down the Nazi empire from the inside.   Pros:  - An incredible storyline set in a 1960s Nazi ruled world. - Aestheticaly pleasing :] - Mixed loud and stealth play - Great divergent-style weapons; Weapons that could have been. - Great mix of enemy personel.   Cons:  - A break from the traditonal Wolfenstein games (Which isn't such a bad thing) - Protagonist's voice acting can be a bit annoying (constantly whipsering soliloquies in a Christian Bale Batman way)   Verdict?    7.5/10  - Wolfenstein: The New Order is a very fun game. When it comes down to the wire though, it is still simply another arcade FPS along the lines of Bioshock, Serious Sams, etc. The saving grace of this game is the great story. The action is also quite fun. The weaponary you will use in The New Order are divergent designs of real weaponry from the WW2 period. Overall, I enjoy playing this game and the replay value is on the higher side of the scale. If you love killing Nazis, WWII history, or even just Wolfenstein in general, I recommend!",

            "review_text": "Just Simply Beautiful!  Wolfenstein: The New Order is set in a Nazi controlled world, where the Nazis won World War 2 and now have power over the world. The campaign tells a fantastic story, one of the best I have ever played, where you feel as if you get to know the characters in a mutual way. The gripping story is fantastic with many different items to collect and is all good, but once you have finished the campaign, that's it you have finished. There is nothing else to do when you complete the campaign and is most certainly not worth £34.99 (approx $59.99) due to there being nothing else to do once the campaign is complete.  In some missions, the game gives you the choice of either going in guns blazing or playing stealthily which both have their pros and cons depending on how you want to do it. This gives the player some freedom and I personally find this very good as you choose how you want to play the game. The gunplay is also responsive and fluid but I found that the gun models were a bit big and took up most of the space on the screen, but I wouldn't let this put you off.  I was running this game with these specs:  AMD FX-4300 @ 3.8GHz 8GB RAM AMD R7 250 DDR3 2GB OC  The frame rate was relatively stable with only some lag on huge explosions, but the frame rate is stable 99% of the time. However, whilst I was playing the game in some missions I found that it took a little while to render some textures when I moved the camera and this was frequent throughout the game and bugged the hell out of me!  In conclusion, I think that anyone who loves fighting Nazis and who loves First Person Shooters with a gripping and compelling storyline will adore Wolfenstein: The New Order. I think that Wolfenstein: The New Order deserves an 8/10 as the storyline is one of the best that I have played, however once the campaign is complete, you won't touch this game for a long time. However, I would wait until the next Steam sale as this game is definately not worth £34.99 ($59.99) for the short hours of gameplay that it has. ",

            "review_text": " A refresing modernification of the series.   In short Wolfenstein: The New Order is story-driven FPS with sneaking and explosive action. The game is set mostly in 1960's Nazi-Europe. I played the game once through, took about 16h on über difficulty. Completed missing achievements in 3h. I have played both Wolfenstein 3D and Return the Castle Wolfenstein, but didn't know about 2009 version of Wolfenstein until after playing this one.   If Doom(2016) is a near-perfect upgrad to 90's shooters, Wolfenstein: The New Order brings the shooters from 99-04 to modern times. If you remember games like  No One Lives forever, Soldier of Fortune, Return the Castle Wolfenstein and Codename Eagle , this is something very similar. Healthpacks and armor from the 90's era are still here, but so are the varying levels, scifi/fantasy settings and somewhat serious tone from the later era. Skill tree is there to remind us that this isn't just a graphics update but a part of an an evolution of a genre.   What W: TNO does right is the core mechanic. In First person shooters the shooting should be fun or atleast enjoyable. That hasn't been the case in quite many games in recent years. Most CoD4 look-a-likes have failed to understand that there should be something of a feedback from shooting people in games. I'm not talking about XP or pop-ups but a feeling that I'm doing something violent to another (virtual)person. So after I had charged through the trenches of the first level with dual wielded assault rifles, I took a long look behind me and saw a bloody mess. Although the gun sounds are somewhat lacking in this game, the effects on enemies made me feel like I was shooting guns, not playing laser tag.   Another thing W:TNO does right is it's skill mechanic. Although the skill mechanic is mostly boosting your existing abilities, it works like a charm and it rewards you for playing in a certain way. Unlike many other games with similar mechanics, you get certain skills for doing certain things. If you sneak, you unlock sneaking perks, and if you use explosive you unlock explosive perks. Progress towards skills is not lost on death, so it is relatively easy to obtain all skills during one playthrough.  The games atmosphere gets also an honorary mention. Although the plot revolves around the goofy idea of Nazi Germany winning world war 2 using robotic dogs, the plot stays dark from start to finish. The story sounds absurd but the game stays true to the idea. The world and it's characters act like it's the most natural thing and there exists only handful of moments where the game implies that this might be ridiculous. So the game isn't making fun of itself but let's the player decide if he takes it seriously or not.   The story relies heavily on charachters and they are very well built. Most of the characthers remain memorable even after just a short introduction. Enemies instill fear with their actions and your friend have their own reasons to keep on the fight. The soundtrack adds to the atmosphere though it isn't exactly true to the timeframe.  There are also some features to critique. The game is easy. I usually pick the medium difficulty with games but in this case I changed to the hardest after 1 hour of playing and found that equal to medium in many other games. I barely had to replay any parts because there was plenty of armor and health around even on hardest difficulties. The intelligence and the amount of enemies is also lacking so the game is easy almost to the finish line. Then again I like the fact that the difficulty only ramps up enemies damage, they mostly die quite easily on harder difficulties too atleast if you aim for the head.  The graphics are decent. The game worked just fine for me and looked good enough, but the inconsistency of graphics affected the experience some what. Forced depth of field, no simple AA-setting and some blurry textures made the game occasionally look unnecessarily ugly. Most levels where colorful and the level design was good enough for most of the time. There has been reported serious performance issues with AMD GPU's and the game has frame-caps so do some research before buying if you think these might affect you.  So it's a fun shooter with a decent storyline. Sure it's not the game of the decade, but well worth the 7 euros it costs these days. If you're not into FPS games, this hasn't got anything radically new in it for you to try it. If you happen to like single player FPS-games, this is a must buy.",

When I embarked on my Nazi-Killing quest, I was having fun right off the bat, the weapons feel great and as I played I unlocked perks for my preffered playstyle, it was a lot fo fun to try and unlock them all, there were also a lot of collectibles to be found, some even unlock special game modes. But as I played on, I was pleasantly surprised by the great deal of story and depth this game has, I was expecting a FPS in the area of Serious Sam and Doom, but what I got was a fun FPS that not only provided me with 30 hours of entertainment, but also with a story that sticks and characters I actually cared about, and most surprisingly   I shed a tear in the end    As strange as it may sound, I feel like this is a more mature shooter, not because it has sex scenes or violence, but because it presents you things like genocide, loss, racism, opression and hate.  These things are not shoved in your face, but it's what drives your small group of resistance, for example; you overhear a conversation bewteen a woman and a nazi officer, the woman wishes to file a report of abnormal behavior about her neighbour's son because she saw him trying on his mother's lipstick.  It's not all super serious-business ofcourse, as Wolfenstein sometimes embraces the ridiculous, like dual-weilding Sniper/Laser rifles, drowning nazis in toilets. After an hour or so, the only thing I was still sceptical about was the level variety, but it turned out this is something the game does really well too, you travel all over the world   even off-world, to the moon  , each level feels unique and memorable.  If you enjoy a good shooter that doesn't hold your hand and has a great deal of fun with some depth to it, Wolfenstein: The New Order is just what you're looking for, I know I certainly was.",

Other characters are doing very well at least. Story is good, not outstanding but solid. Maps are long, but since it is a linear shooter it doesn't hurt. They allow freedom to a degree. What surprised me - this game has a simple but very satysfying stealth system. Stealthing was very enjoyable and I devoted a full playthrough to it.   Guns are great. They sound absolutely massive (assault rifles in particular). Their models and animations are excellent. Enemy variety isn't big, but every character is detailed and has great animations. They sound very well too.   Collectibles - YES! It wouldn't be a proper Wolf game without those. They are nicely hidden and there is sort of meta game related to them and Nazi Commanders. You have to find out yourself, but this is a really nice idea and I loved it.  Graphics - great. Graphical style - outstanding and certain vistas are stunning - not that they are beautiful, but impressive. Music is great - a mix of metal and industrial - excellent match to atmosphere. Performance is good.   PC version has FOV slider as well as toggle option for crouching, running and iron sights. Everything else that should be in PC game is present. Very good port.   By now you should have an impression that new Wolf is a good game. It isn't. It's excellent in every department. If you like eliminating Nazis then it's a game for you. A worthy RTCW and Wolfenstein (from 2009) successor. Dual wield and wipe them out for good.",

That's just the story, the gameplay is pure FPS action. You can dual-wield almost every weapon in the game (including assault rifles), and it's just   so satisfying   to shoot your guns. Seriously, it can't be described, just play it. I haven't even mentioned the stealth mechanics either, which are very well-developed and you can tell that it wasn't a last-day effort. If you just want an FPS game where the shooting is what matters, then Wolfenstein is one of the best options.   BTW, I got this game dirt-cheap for $10 during a sale, you won't regret it.",

I enjoyed the game from the first moment to the last, the plot is really well written, and even a person who haven't played its predecessors will quickly find himself in the world of Wolfenstein. Playability of this game is through the roof - you can almost feel the joy of killing every damn Nazi (maybe I'm just a sick person). Graphical side of the game is generally satisfying.   The controls are very responsive and after a few hours of play you already feel like an MLG pro. Perks are cool addition (they are kinda standard in most FPS games) and are not that hard to get. Same goes with achievements, most of which are progress related or simply obtainable by getting a certain perk. The characters are very well designed, e.g. Deatshead makes an impression of a real sick mind, striving for power, and through the cutscenes you can almost see why so many people fear him.  Minor flaw of the entire production is the level of difficulty. Personally I think that the hardest difficulty is relatively easy, and for an experienced player finishing Wolfenstein on UBER is not that big of a challenge. Also I can admit that lower difficulties are designed well to fit the casuals that don't want to challenge themselves, but to enjoy this amazing plot.   Last but not least, let's talk about collectibles. Some of them are quite hard to find, but that only makes finding them more satisfying. Moreover, the Enigma Code puzzles are cool addition to the game, and allow us to unlock bonus game modes.   To summarize - I really enjoyed every minute of the gameplay, and I think the game is worth every penny. I'd recommend it to everyone 10/10  Pros:    Well written plot    Playability    Good character design    Achievements and collectibles    Overal fun of playing  Cons:   Lack of a really challenging difficulty level  ",

If you love classic shooters like Wolfenstein 3D or Half-Life 2, this is probably for you. The dual-weilding/alt-fire mode of the weapons is incredibly enjoyable, and provides a formidable arsenal against the hoards of mecha-future Nazis you will gleefuly gib, splatter, stab, explode and otherwise maim. Howver, I would level that the lazor weapon is relied on too much by the designers as a kill stick for higher calibre enemies, and as a result your traditional stockpile of arms can feel neglected. The game unlike a majority of other moder shooters does not include a multiplayer component, but I never felt anything was lost from a lack of it. Rather the resources that would have gone towards the multiplayer were directed into the single-player campaign. Locations varied as castles, U-boats and even moonbases serve to clearly distinguish the levels, much like an old NES game would.The game also features a plethora of collectibles including Nazi gold, code fragments, diary entries and even records parodying music of the 50s and 60s in a New Regime style to great effect.  While the game does have an abundance of cutscenes, they were never too much of a distraction from the general action of the main story, and provided B.J. a sense of characterization and depth usually unseen in the traditional meat-headed guntoter. Machine Games did an excellent job of creating dispicable Nazi heads you would love to plow through hundreds of their subordinates to eliminate. Sadly the chance to deliver such sweet justice by your hand is denied. The supporting cast is similarly developed well enough to gain your alligiance but is not seen as much. This should stand as a crime: the allied cast simply does not get enough screen time or even backstory to fill my desire to know more about them.   Overall Wolfenstein: The New Order comes out as a highly enjoyable FPS romp through a dystopian future-past which will leave your smiling face coated in Nazi blood.",

            "review_text": "Ah yisss. It's been a long time since I've enjoyed a single player story driven FPS this much. Wolfenstein: The New Order (W:TNO) is somewhat of a return to roots for the venerable franchise. As most people know, the first game, Wolfenstein 3D is the FPS PC game that popularized the genre and is responsible for its continued success today. After a few sequels, an amazing multiplayer game, and a supposedly disappointing reboot in 2009, W:TNO has a lot to prove. Thankfully, W:TNO exceeds expectations and more.  We return to protagonist B.J. Blazkowicz, the seemingly most generic of all generic McWhite guys who gets knocked out in a late WW2 operation to take down series antagonist uber Nazi, Deathshead. He wakes up 14 years later, but the world has changed. The Nazis won. The Beatles are singing in german. Manhattan is a nuclear wasteland. Swastika flags are flown across the world. Instead of a U.S. army, there is nothing but a small insurgency against the world's new masters. This change in narrative is well executed and shows a hopeless group of rebels fighting for little more than a dream of a world that no longer exists. I was genuinely surprised by how seriously this game took itself, but instead of being soapy and melodramatic, it hit some legitimately painful emotional notes. The storyline is dark and dreary, strange in a game that allows you to dual wield automatic shotguns and blast entire rooms of nazis to bits.  It’s strangely refreshing to see a return to the design of older FPSes. W: TNO is released on today’s market full of killstreaks and regenerating health, where an FPS with no multiplayer component is akin to financial suicide. It’s released in a market full of games with moral ambiguity as well as unrestrained jingoism. However, the bad guys in W: TNO have no moral ambiguity. They’re just evil, dastardly Nazis, who have now taken over the world and are spreading their evil deeds like wildfire. Which makes killing them very cathartic. And oh boy, is the gunplay in this game fantastic. You can dual wield most weapons and each gun is “punchy” and full of character. Eventually you’ll get alternate firing modes that adds to the strategy, as you can have a gun in your right hand using one mode and the gun in the other using another. If I have a complaint about the gunplay is that dual wielding is pretty OP. I understand that this game is all about mowing down Nazis without discrimination, but there’s literally no reason to NOT dual wield. Honestly, you don’t really suffer an aiming penalty at all for holding two giant assault rifles, you can still hit a penny from hundreds of yards away. Regardless, busting into a room, strafing the entire area with a hailstorm of bullets, churning up papers, woodwork and blasting into groups of Nazis, throwing blood splatter and body parts everywhere in a violent cacophony is really something quite special. The stealth system works well too, it’s much like Far Cry 3’s sneaky beaky stuff with throwing knives and silenced pistols.  The developers were right in stating that the lack of multiplayer really allowed them to focus on bringing an amazing world to life. This is one of those games where there’s almost too much detail. You can read tons of newspapers clippings hung up the wall, each explaining a snippet of just how the Nazis won the war. They didn't have to model the thompson submachine gun just for the first mission of the game (never seen for the rest of the game), but they did anyway in order to avoid being anachronistic. Every part of the world is meticulously crafted, from the books lined on a Nazis commander’s room to subtle graffiti dotting the Berlin sewers. It’s all extremely pretty and immersive, and it shows by the insanely large install size (~50gb). I had to leave my computer for almost half a week for it to finish. Regardless, this game is a labor of love, and an incredible showcase of how much detail a development team can cram into the environment.   $60 bucks is asking a bit much for a single player experience that lasts about 15 hours, but multiple playthroughs and collectible items are reasons to come back for more. The core shooting and stealth mechanics are enjoyable and never get old. I’d say wait for it to be about 50% off to pick it up, but if you’re an FPS shooter fan, especially if you’re a fan of older FPSes, this is a must have!",

            "review_text": "On the surface,  Wolfenstein: The New Order  is a game about killing Nazis and in this it most certainly excels, with immensely rewarding and fluid gameplay that rewards specific play styles and thus replay value. Whoever thought it'd be a great idea to dual-wield pretty much every rifle in the game is a genius, as this features some of the best shooting mechanics I've personally experienced. If you wish to play this simply for the bloody and glorious action, then you certainly won't be disappointed.   But more than that,  The New Order  is a FPS about humanity and how we behave in the face of overwhelming adversity. It avoids the pitfalls of the genre that often portray such evils in superficial and one-dimensional ways and suffer from bad writing as a result.    Wolfenstein  is the complete opposite.  When it comes to depicting the horrors of a technologically advanced Nazi regime, Machine Games must be greatly applauded for handling the subject matter with a fine precision. This is predominantly achieved through the remarkable cutscenes and soundtrack. As one of the greats of the shooter genre, the re-incarnation of  Wolfenstein  often feels like a great film and work of art rather than what could be misinterpreted as a brainless shooter, and is a far-cry from the days of  3D  or  Castle Wolfenstein . The extraordinary direction of the cutscenes is reinforced by the top notch score throughout, which really does capture and engross the player. Complementing the fantastic range of weaponry and upgrades, the sound design in general is phenomenal. This is a very intense game in a lot of ways but remains captivating from start to finish. The single-player campaign is remarkable, and well-worth the omission of any multiplayer component.  The Nazis are, of course, the enemy faction but the game also provides significant commentary on the nature of war itself, as well as granting a voice to those often unheard during the conflicts. While certainly focused on a small range of characters, in areas outside of combat even level design provides a fleshed-out and believable world, one that allows for the grand narrative to play out.  As a protagonist, William Joseph 'B.J.' Blazkowicz is fascinating. Seen by his comrades as the walking death machine and embodiment of shock-and-awe tactics, throughout the game he is given remarkable depth and provides poignant insight into the horrors he constantly experiences. He does not shy away from the horrible things he committs but retains his morality without having to personally justify the things he does.  He is the flawed hero of the  Wolfenstein  series and receives his greatest outing yet here.  Deviating to technical comments quickly, I did frequently experience huge issues with texture popping and stuttering; an issue that apparently continues to plague the engine despite my own attempts to tweak or fix them. The stealth system was fairly robust with decent AI, if somewhat simplistic. Another thing to consider is the price, which remains very high for a game that is more than a year old now... but that is a comment for Bethesda/Zenimax games in general. But I've rambled on long enough though, so let's conclude.    Wolfenstein: The New Order  is a landmark for the shooter genre, boasting top-notch gameplay across the board. It is a narrative done right, portraying the unimaginable horrors of totalitarian cleansing in a believable and uncompromising way. Packed full of detail with a superb soundtrack from start to finish, this stylish shooter is unlike any other.  It is not  perfect  but it is thrilling and deeply satisfying, and gaming is all the better for it.",

It's more than 'competent' though. In fact - I think it might be one of the best games of the year. Given that the game is an over-the-top, Nazi killing simulator, I was expecting the story to be more of an afterthought. Surprisingly though, the game's alternate history story is compelling and the game does a good job with world building by peppering the levels with optional conversations and newspaper clippings that help make the world seem more alive. I was expecting the story to go for camp humor, but the game takes itself very seriously at times and the quality of the writing is such that it doesn't come off like some 12 year old's idea of what's is dark and gritty.  I also admire the game's design philosophy, as it does a good job of combining the better elements of new-school and old-school FPS design. For example, the game's health system is a hybrid between health pickups and regenerating health. The way it works is that you can only regenerate health in blocks of 20. If you were to start with 100 health and then lose 95, you'd only be able to regenerate up to 20. I like this system a lot, since it alleviates some of the 'die and retry' repetition from older shooters, but still encourages you to keep moving instead of just hiding behind a wall while you wait for your health to recharge.  The levels are well-designed, with lots of large open rooms, secrets and multiple paths. The controls are nice and responsive, and there's a decent selection of weapons with balanced strengths and weaknesses. You can slide into cover, or shoot while sliding. You can also dual-wield almost every single weapon in the game for an increase in rate of fire while sacrificing accuracy. There are situations where you can take out enemies using stealth, or just go in guns blazing. There's also a perk system that levels up organically based on things you do in the game rather than experience (like x number of head shots with the pistol, or stealth kills using throwing knifes).  The game is just... a lot of fun. There isn't any one thing that makes this game stand out when compared to other shooters, but it does many things very well and manages to feel very fresh while not doing anything particularly new. Machine Games did good here. I really hope that we'll see a sequel from them at some point!",

Honestly, I would classify this as a Above-average shooter with some B-movie elements, but there is heart and thought as well. The shooting is good, and the gameplay is classic FPS. It is a linear experience, however, the game does allow you to be creative in your Nazi killing. Personally, I generally liked the Stealthy assassin approach, but the fact that it allows this approach at all is a positive. What really surprises me is how relfective, and thoughtful the story actually is. Instead of just concentrating on Nazis on the moon, and other Alt-history fun with technology, you get a feeling of what it would be life under Nazi rule had they won. Spoiler, it's bad. It is a dark game, and it says something about sacrifice, the damage done to soldiers because of war, and the horrors that the Nazi are capable. It was a more emotional game than I expected and that takes a good shooter to a great one. Do yourself a favor and get this game on a sale, and kill some Nazis....",

            "review_text": "Having played all Wolfenstein games going back to the original id bombshell of the early 1990's, this particular version takes the game to new heights. The graphics and visual effects are very good and the audio is also excellent. Stealth is a major factor in survival and can be used to eliminate with great success on most of the enemy including the nasty 'Armoured Dogs' that proliferate the game. Don't try this though on any mechanised robotic device as failure will be certain and will set you back somewhat causing you to start again from the last checkpoint. (Albeit not a major problem).  Weapon options although at times limited do not seem to hinder the main character to any great degree as he is able to despatch most opposition with a minimum of fuss. Planning how you go about this is the important thing to consider as opposed to what you have to do to complete the task at hand. Bear in mind also that you need to replenished ammunition and health/armour regularly so take time to look around for possible and usually neccessary pickups, (approach and gather anything that glows for they will most likey be usable items).  You can collect 'Trophies' as well so investigate unusual looking objects and read notices on walls and desks for information (although this can be a little tedious at times when you are trying to get things done).  If you see a bed, have a sleep and you may be surprised at what happens when you do and my opening line will give you a hint as to what to expect!  The game is not open world in as much as you cannot simply move around free to do things as you wish and unlimited exploring is not an option, you go where your mission directs you and that's it!  This leads me to my main dislike, too many cutscenes that slow down gameplay. At times the player (me at least) is left saying 'Not another one, I just want to get on with the game!'   I guess the creators were trying to incorporate the feeling of abject misery (the prison scenes alone will assert to that), but may have allowed that idea to stem the flow effect as in pulling on the reigns which brings you to a grinding halt. This then gives the game a 'Build it up as you go' arrangement where you are completing missions which only help to build a small part of the next objective. For me that scenario can get a little tiresome, I am sure for others it is more than acceptable so it is all about what an individual wants and expects from a game, but these are my views and I accept that.  In conlusion (and now that I have completed the game), I recommend it as on the whole it is very good but for me at times a bit depressing. If that was the aim of the developers then they succeeded, I just felt a bit hobbled! The real action takes place about a third of the way through and from there it takes off and is excellent and should not dissapoint.  Took approx. 15 hrs to go through first time (not bad), but missed many items that I will collect next time through. I would rate this game 7.5/10 and my screenshots will give you an indication of gameplay.  Certainly worth a go, but maybe best to wait for a sale.  Also, a strong suggestion is to play Wolfenstein 'The Old Blood' first....It is a prequal and it does flow on to 'New Order'. Had I done this I would have started New Order with a different mindset and understanding.",

            "review_text": "Wolfenstein is a good, solid, shooter that was fun and enjoyable to play. It is set mainly in the 1960s where WWII was won by Nazi Germany. You play as a soldier who was badly injured during an assault and has spent the past few years in a vegetable state in a hospital. The game seems to borrow from other games as at times it will feel very familar. In ways it is similar to the early Medal of Honor or the first Call of Duty games where you encounter enemies at a middle distance and they dive and shoot from behind cover. Other times it seems to have been influenced by Dishonored with the stealth sections and animated backstabs. It doesn't quite match those games in terms of execution of the mechanics but they are decent.   Wolfenstein's employs a standard mission and base system where you complete a few missions and head back to your base for a breather. It uses the base as a way of expanding on some of the characters and fill in the back story. There are some interesting, memorable characters in Wolfenstein but unfortunately that makes some of the others seem one dimensional. I feel that maybe with a bit more time, focus and care this game could have been truly great. The story is at times over the top which lends well to the gameplay, however around the midway point there is one to two chapters which are just plain dumb. It stupidly tosses in a 'secret Jewish organisation' into the mix which, gladly, is only touched on for one chapter. Aside from that there are nice touches which help shape the story; such as the main character muttering about distant memories throughout the game.  The level design is very good generally with expansive indoor maps that allow you to do a bit of exploring. As a homge to the early Wolfenstein games there are gold objects and other hidden goodies littered throughout the game. Letters and newspapers are hidden to provide background and as in early 90s shooters enemies drop armour and ammo. The game strangely gets you to press E to collect these pickups which seems a bit odd. Simply running over them would have been a better choose. I actually liked the perk systems in this game as it is not intrusive. You gain perks by just repeating actions such as killing enemies with throwing knives or headshotting guards. There are four bands of perks which cover stealth play, assault play, tactical and demolition. You can purposely pursue them but I found they populated as I played.   It was nice for me to play a game where the movement is fairly quick, guns are snappy, and pack a punch. Dual-weilding chunky shotguns was a good throw back. There is a peek-from-cover move which I rarely used as you can just blast away. Wolf contains a laser cutting weapon which was versitile and upgradable. Again, if more time had been spend on it I feel it could have been as good as the Gravity Gun in HL2. There just aren't too many levels that explore its features fully. It also highlights a few inconsistences with the levels and 'world'. An example would be how certain metal sheets and surfaces are destructable yet some wooden panels or metal boxes aren't. I think it is more a restriction employed for consoles that hindered the game a bit. Its the same with the textures which can be low-res in some places. The game does run very smooth and I experienced no slow down.  The AI of the enemies is a lot better when they are fighting as it quickly becomes apparant that their stealth AI is sloppy. I've had guards look straight at me or see their colleague get shot just to turn and walk away. The first stealthy mission is the best as it has multiple routes the others are very hit and miss. Firefights however are very satisfying and can be challenging when you encounter the different types of soldiers. The game has a decent difficulty level which can cause you to die a few times when you get overwhelmed. Overall Wolfenstein is worth it as it is a fun experience. The majority of the levels are diverse in theme and design. It is not run and gun shooter of old but more of a blend of modern and old. There is no magic directional arrow showing you the way so sometimes you can get lost. I will be replaying this game again to see what I missed. It just misses out on being an 8 out of 10 game.   ",

I epsecially love the duel wielding and the different upgrades for your arsenal that you can pick up along the way.   The collectables add replayability value to the game, (as if it needed extra) and will keep you searching for them guides online. The downtime between missions is great, and meeting the different people within the resistance is great, it adds a personal feeling to the game, and the easter egg in the resistance headquarters is brilliant!  The soundtrack is brilliant, and you can find collectable records in the game so you can listen to a 60's Nazi take on well known western music of the real world. In each level you play you will unlock concept art of the levels, and a quick screenie will provide you with lots of wallpapers to spuce up your computer. There are so many different collectables that you can find and recieve that add so much depth to the game, and if you're a story lover, then this will definitely take your fancy, so make sure you read the character bios and listen to the audio logs and more!  There are many different ways to play the game, there are four different skill trees, each with unique perks, the trees are; Stealth, Tactical, Demolition and Assault, and by completing certain objectives you can unlock a new perk, and you can have as many as you want, it's not just one tree. By doing this, it adds a new element to the game, which way do you want to play? There are quite a lot of opportunities to go at it stealthily and more opportunities to go at it guns blazing.  As afore mentioned, there are few faults I can pick, the only big noticable thing is the texture pop-in, which has not been improved since the first ID Tech 5 game, RAGE (2011), however, it's likely that you'll be having so much fun that you won't really notice it.

As my home is in the multiplayer shooters and the campaigns are more of a 'Oh my internet is down I'll play this'. There are two main stories, which split with decisions you make ingame, which I have played one of. The story that I finished (fergus') was presented with solid script and many moments of genuis, comically or in set peices.  The gameplay as a whole is thoughly intertaining with the loud and brash or stealthy and silent options presented, both giving satifying results and above all else Gore. The gore and horrors this series is famed for, while not shown by throwing bucket-loads of blood, is ever present and satisfying especaily on the antagonists.

Medium: When we write the history of video games as an art form I believe this game will be remembered as a landmark for its treatment of sex. The game boldly makes it clear up front that sex is part of Blazkowicz's relationship with his love interest, yet they manage to do it in a way that elevates it from simple lust or an exploitive attempt to sell sex to a depiction of an intimate experience shared between people who truly love one another.  Long: This game fails to live up to the legacy of previous Wolfenstein games. When I see Wolfenstein in the title of a game I think men with biceps so large they have difficulty wearing anything with longer sleeves than a muscle shirt, chin clefts so deep you could build a mineshaft in them, machismo levels so high that they punch on sight any sissy who actually uses the word 'machismo', and ranges of emotion that lead you to suspect they've undergone a partial lobotomy. To all outward appearances this perfectly describes the protagonist William 'B.J.' Blazkowicz. In previous games Blazkowicz has always been little more than a 1940's Duke Nukem with just barely enough taste not to quote bad movies while killing Nazis. As a result I came into the game expecting 'Generic Nazi Murder Simulator 2014'. That is not what I got.  The story of Wolfenstein: The New Order as any synapses will tell you is the tale of jarhead William 'B.J.' Blazkowicz waking up in an alternate universe in which the Nazi have won WW2 and taken over the world. He has to lead the resistance, tear down their symbols of power, bring hope to an otherwise hopeless and dreary world, yadda yadda yadda something something Half-life 2. This is all true. However the game is in many ways Half-life 2's better in many ways. The writing is shockingly good. In inner dialogues and exchanges with his companions we occasionally glimpse something deeper and more sensitive through Blazkowicz's solemn and emotionless mask. We begin to see him not as a man who does not feel, but as a man who hides his feelings for fear that they will make him weak and destroy him. At the end of the first mission he (and thus the player) is forced by a villain to make a sort of Sophie's choice, with no third option save for a gameover. It's a horrible and terrifying scene during which we see him at his most vulnerable, and while he doesn't show any visible emotion it clearly leaves mental scars which stay with him for the rest of the game.  It's not just his ability to feel pain the game shows us either. It's his ability to feel love. When we write the history of video games as an art form I believe this game will be remembered as a landmark for its treatment of sex. The game boldly makes it clear up front that sex is part of Blazkowicz's relationship with his love interest, yet they manage to do it in a way that elevates it from simple lust or an exploitive attempt to sell sex to a depiction of an intimate experience shared between people who truly love one another. While she initially appears to be a vulnerable maiden in distress, over the course of the game we begin to see that she is in many ways Blazkowicz's counterpart. Just Blazkowicz conceals sensitive soul inside a warriors body, we learn that she conceals a warriors soul inside her fragile exterior.  The ending is also not what you'd call typical of stereotypical FPS games. I don't want to spoil it because it's actually quite moving. Oh and the FPS bits are quite nice too.",

            "review_text": "This game encompasses old and new, a throw back to the health and armor system that seems to have been lost on most shooters these days. The gunplay is absolutely fantastic, it feels smooth and fresh like it did in RAGE but better in my opinion, I haven't felt this satisfied with a shooter since Half-Life 2: Episode 2. The sounds and music transitions with the cut scenes are absolutely beautiful and the voice acting is really well done.   With hints of Tarantino style story telling, the game pulls you through both sides of the spectrum when it comes to feelings and responses, like a rollercoaster of rage and punishment. I can safely say this is the first time a game has really put me through a process of 'Oh god that is awful, why am I looking at this' to 'I really want to rip that persons head off' It's a game that, to many, doesn't seem to take itself seriously, but it does - in its own special way. It's a hard thing to go into an alternate path of history and for it to be taken seriously. While Wolfenstein The New Order may miss it at some points, it nails it to a cross on a frequent basis. While I was playing I constantly was thinking about the story and how it seemed to be an analogy of insanity &amp; rage. The level of absurdity you go through was extremely satisfying, you get the feeling that its completely ok to go over the top to wipe a Nazi out, that you could not accept that they became such a power and you would do everything to wipe them out with no remorse.   I'm currently going through the second playthrough at the moment. There is a point early on in the game where you make a choice and it ends up giving you a specific experience with characters because of that choice. You have altnerate methods of accessing locked areas, and new secret areas that you will come across, as well as acquiring weapons at earlier points in the game, all depending on the choice you make early on. It's an interesting twist to the game, and definitely can make a second playthrough worth it to some extent - may update when im finished with the second playthrough.   Overall Wolfenstein The New Order didn't play the usual harp strings of emotion, it took its own path - while this path may not fit for some, I have a feeling many will really get a kick out of it, and find it extremely satisfying. I wish there was more to play, I really hope MachineGames continues to dig into the Wolf universe, this is the first Wolfenstein single player experience that I REALLY loved, even over RTCW (with the exception of its multiplayer ;p)   also MachineGames, if you're listening - get on the phone with Splash Damage and work with them on making Enemy Territory in this universe ;)  -- I know many people are having issues with playing the game from a technical standpoint so if they are curious, I played the game with maxed out settings @ 1600x900 resolution and things ran smooth as silk for me, didnt even crash once, I was even live streaming the whole thing.

            "review_text": "Ahh.. The New Order.. After the success which was the Return To Castle Wolfenstein, fans were waiting 8 years for another Wolfenstein, which turned out to be good, which was it's biggest issue. It was just 'good', a decent FPS shooter, but without the feeling and climat of the 2001's RTCW. 5 years after, in 2014 we got Wolfenstein: The New Order. Bethesda, Machine Games and id, promised, that the new Wolf, will stand up to the level of it's 13-year old brother. But is it actually worth to be called 'RTCW's heir'?  HOLY F*CKING YES! Where should I start? The plot. The beginning takes place during WWII, which should not be a surprise to anyone. Like in previous games, you play as a B.J. Blazkowicz, once again with a goal to finally kill 'Deathshead' Unfortunately the assault on his fortress ends up with a failure, you lose your squad and find out that 20 years passed by and nazis has taken the control over the world! It is your job to at least try, to do something about it, if it's still possible that is.  During the game, you'll visit various places, even the concentration camp in which you can experience the particle of suffering from people that are held there. You can hear them talking about their families, how they got seperated from each other, etc. In RTCW you had castles, secret laboratories, catacombs, etc. and if you actually thought you saw everything, and it can't go further than that, then bruh... you haven't seen anything yet.  The game looks and plays great, even on my crappy PC, with the lowest details it looked really good and still gave me a lot of fun.  When it comes to music, it's really good, but to me, there's only one track that truly stands out. Unfortunatelly it plays once and very late into the game, but when it plays, man.... Chills all the way down the spine. You did a great job with it, Mr. Gordon. Hats off.  Someties you get to choose the way of killing the nazis, that is when the 'signal detected' message appers in the upper-right corner. It means that there are commanders around which can call for support if they find you, you can eliminate them one-by-one and be sneaky-peaky, or just say BRING IT ♥♥♥♥♥! Rush forward and vaporize everything that breathes. Personally, I recommend the first way in later stages, especially on higher difficulty settings. Overall when it comes to gameplay there's nothing wrong about it and your weapons can be upgraded too (f.e. your assault rifle can shoot rockets!).  But of course there always have to be some flaws, here's no exception. It took me 15 hours to beat the game on 'Bring em' on' difficulty, which seems preety short to me, also some of the later stages follow the similar scheme. Kill nazis in a big hall or something like that, move through corridors and tunnels, kill nazis, move through tunnels and repeat till the end. The game also lacks bosses, there are 3, maybe 4 in total, which wouldn't be bad, RTCW had the similar amount of bosses, but here, they all appear near the end! I almost started thinking that there may be no bosses at all! Who doesn't like to take down the giant mecha and make some noise from time to time? The worst thing about this game is the ending, the motherf**king ending which just begs to be different, and i don't understand why it ends in such a way, it could easily be different, why they decided to put out something like this, I have no god damn idea...  *SPOILER WARNING* If you haven't beaten the 15th chapter - don't uncover the text below!    There's one moment in the game, that I remember the most, earlier in this review I mentioned, that one song stands out of the entire OST. It plays in 15th chapter, it's so beautiful and fits SO PERFECTLY, that i don't know how to describe it. It fills you with sorrow and anger that can be satisfied only when all the nazis in your sight will bite the dust, as you walk through the burning remnants of your destroyed past-HQ, knowing that your friends are dead or captured by Deathshead... I have to say, that this might be the first time, when I got touched while playing a video game. And it comes from a guy who gave no sh*t about the ending of 'Angel Beats'. Anyway, the song is called 'Ransacked'.    To sum up, I'd love to give this game 10/10, but I can't, instead I have to give it 9/10 because of the flaws I've mentioned above and the price this game's asking for. 50 Euro is too much in my opinion, so just wait for the discout and then pick it, you won't regret it. I f*cking recommend this game to everyone, despite some flaws it's still an amazing game that will blow your balls, or boobs. And I can see why TB picked it as 'The game of 2014.'",

            "review_text": "Ok first thing’s first, this is NOT a remake, it’s not even a reimagining, this game appears to happen roughly in the same universe as the original Woflenstine but it is it’s own game.  Visually it is a vast improvement over iD’s last title Rage though they appear to be using an updated version of the same engine. You will see some Unreal engine style texture pop-ins, which is a shame in this day and age, however it runs very well and for what it is the game still looks good and has some very nice visuals. Levels have some level of destruction; at least of cover so there is that upgrade, pillars, barriers, certain types of metal sheets can all be gradually broken and shot through different methods. There is a minor cover system, akin to FarCry 3’s system where you can pop out or over something if you get into the correct position which helps during combat. There are modeled and skinned in damage indicators for enemy troops, and given that this is a iD game expect some gibs, limbs, some pretty brutal cut scenes, and fair quick but significant take down animations some are quite visceral.  There is a stealth mechanic and depending on your play style you may simply favor running and gunning which, given the fact that you can dual wield almost every weapon in the game you have enough firepower in your hands. However if you wish to avoid as much attention and fighting as possible, or you enjoy watching the stealth kill animations then you can, at times it’s more beneficial to do so as a fair amount of the enemies in W:NO pixel hunt or are just extremely accurate even while running or moving around. However stealth wise they tend to be both blind or severely impaired, while at the same time incredibly hyper sensitive to anything and unfortunately the cause varies, the stealth over all can be very forgiving, which is good because there is NO QUICK SAVE! That is unfortunately correct, there is no quick save in this PC game, I do not understand why this was not added in but the actual developers Machinehead Games really screwed up with this omission. If you die part of the way through an engagement you will probably not be able to start where you’d like and sometimes you have to do entire sections over again, other times the auto save places a spot right after. You will need to learn from your mistakes or trial and error it unfortunately; however there are only a few sections in the entire game where I can honestly say that I had trouble with.   There is a leveling up/skill tree system for this game and for the most part it flows quite well. There are requirements that you have to meet in order to move onto the next branch or in order to meet a requirement for a skill that is not actually connected to a previous skill. These vary from performing take downs, throwing back grenades, killing a certain amount of enemies while dual wielding weapons, silent kills with throwing knives, and so on. Some of the requirements however are for the most part nothing but grinding and putting yourself into situation that you would normally not put yourself into AND the game very rarely actually uses this kind of attack which defeats the purpose of requiring it, so you will have to find work around for these unfortunately. Luckily the forums on Steam are fairly helpful and I know of two skill points that I didn’t know if I would be able to do them that I was actually able to pull off fairly easily by cheating the system, but not actually cheating mind you, simply the description on many of them is vague and the requirements can be met in different ways then what is actually written in the game.  One other major fault is the totally not old school mechanic of having to manually pick up items one by one. Picture this, you’ve expended your assault rifle ammo and you’re in a semi arena still rife with bad guys, well in W:NO you need to crack open boxes and constantly be looking at the floor for dead bodies so you can rapidly press your use key in order to pick things up. I can not understand what they were trying to do with this; I can maybe understand it for the gold items, intel and other collectables but NOT armor, health and ammo. This gets worse when you have to fight the last boss, since every enemy in the game has pin point accuracy you have to continually run and “dodge” in order to juke his shots and on top of that you need to scramble around looking for health, ammo and armor pick ups in boxes and frantically press your use key in order to pick them up. I have to wonder if Bethesda had anything to do with this choise since, as I recall, you picked up items manually in many of their games; the difference being however that unlike say Oblivion you are not dodging bullets in frantic fights.  The story and characters are pretty well done and there is a single point where you make one decision that will alter what doors you can interact with and that is all, there are no alternative story arcs. This is fine because the story is fairly good, at least when compared to past Woflenstine titles, the characters and B.J. are the main focus of most cutscenes as well as minor story additions when you are back at the main base. B.J. is far more fleshed out in this version of him then in any of the past games, while he may seem to be just a muscle head they make him out to be fairly intelligent and kind. Each side character has their own story line and you will get bits and pieces of it as the game progresses which is a welcome addition as it further fleshes out that person. While nothing ground breaking happens during these lulls in the fighting it’s defiantly a welcome addition.   The weapons feel and sound quite good and the skill upgrades add some flavors to them that help in dealing with some of the more heavily armored enemies. Though speaking of enemies some of the armored human units like the shotgunners are just damn annoying and practically a mini boss, their shotguns ricochet off surfaces and do insane amounts of damage in a short amount of time. There is usually one extra attachment for each weapon, though one in particular has several through the entire game. The real benefit to the skill columns is that you can gain all of them and go back and start a new game, getting the benefits which will enable you to play with a different playstyle then you would have before.  Both the sound effects and the music are very fitting for the game type, the weapon sounds are very good and have a plenty of oomph behind them, the shotgun being one of my favorites, it sounds like the part. The music was actually better then I expected, and it changes from stealth to active engagement when stealth is broken. Each level has its own music score and they all sound very different from each other, sort of giving them even more of their own personality.   Being a Wolfenstine game the developers saw fit to go back to the roots and added a fair amount of collectables, gold items, intel, music, letters and audio logs. If you’re a completionist then you will get some extra hours trying to fine every single item, which for me added to about 36 hours total play time. Granted this game is only single player thus some people may say it’s not nearly enough content given how large the game really is, 40 gigs is never something to sneeze at. There is some talk about adding a few extra levels, maybe multiplayer or something; however it is all just hearsay.   For $60 full price I might be hard pressed to suggest a game like this, however given that it did give me 36 hours, it’s not a hard sell I would say however that if you are at all on the fence about the price versus the content then I would wait for a sale, after that it will be well worth it. Either way I had fun with it and I hope they will continue in some way, this also gives me some hope as to what Doom could possibly be like.",

The problem of ludonarrative dissonance (as seen in recent shooters such as Bioshock: Infinite) is not a problem here, because the player experiences firsthand, often in states of powerlessness, the atrocities committed by the bad guys, so often that by the time he or she is locked and loaded with akimbo, fully automatic shotguns, he or she is ready to mete out righteous buckshot justice. More than dull shooting galleries, every fight becomes an act of catharsis. This is why we crave better stories in games - not because of an appeal to some artistic standard set by film and literature, but because of the way it FEELS.   Three-dimmensional characters, wonderfully despicable villains, a romance subplot that, as far as I'm concerned, is touching, and a seemingly meatheaded protagonist who, as you get to know him, turns out to be just a peace-loving country boy fighting for friends, family, and barbeques on sunny, suburban lawns.",

            "review_text": "I hadn't played a Wolfenstein game since Spear of Destiny and was a little curious about the series.  I couldn't help but compare Wolfenstein to Rage and Dishonored. Wolfenstein doesn't have the same out of this world environments that Rage has and it doesn't have the sort of moral choices that make a real difference in the outcome of the game like with Dishonored. Also, the perk system in Wolfenstein seemed more like it was meant to distract the player from how easy most of the game is by giving them a treat each time they stabbed someone just so a certain number of times. The perks really don't translate to adding a new method of playing the game, they give you more ammo, a little bit of health regeneration, occasionally you can dismember enemies, or something else like that. Its not like how different skills can drastically change how you play the game like with Dishonored. Another comparison that came to mind is to the Metro Series whose story line (and the 'moral' choices you must make) interested me more and also had better stealth versus run and gun gameplay styles than Wolfenstein (again imo). I guess overall I felt like Wolfenstein combined a lot of popular game elements I'd seen in other games I liked but didn't do any of them nearly as well.   However, Wolfenstein does have a gripping story that made me care about the characters. I got hit in the feels a few times when **** went down with a main character and the storytelling cutscenes are amazing. It also made me think I was playing a sort of messed up version of Uncharted. The game took me 18 hours to beat which I did in one sitting netting 65% completion. I played in on Uber difficulty for the entire game except the last boss which I had to reduce the difficulty to hurt me plenty for. So I guess despite all the things Wolfenstein wasn't, it's still a solid title that was worth purchasing at 50% off during the steam sale. It definitely passes the 'movie test' (is it as much or more fun than a movie for as much or less than the cost of a movie per hour?). So I have no regrets except that I didn't unlock the explosives perk tree because I stealthed almost the entire god damned game even when I didn't have to.",

Despite having such relatively simple gameplay it is done really well, and I was entertained the entire way through this game, which was much longer than I first thought as well. The atmosphere also plays a part in this game, and really brings the world to life with nazi propaganda and presents you with a quite obscene future where nazi ideology rules the world.

I love all the interesting design choices that were made in this game, the characters, props, vehicles all were very cool and well thought out to fit in this game's universe, nothing you see denies that fact. All of the weapons felt very natural to use and I felt that I actually used the whole array of arms throughout the game. (which is not common, usually Ill find myself only using one gun through the full game) All of the guns looked as good as they felt to use, you can really get the whole Wolfenstien design in the edge flow and sharp corners that you find on the weapons; It all feels very perfect, like all of the guns were designed perfectly to do what they are intended it do.   I really enjoyed B.J.'s design, it's a great throwback to the games that have come before (with exception to the latest game) and the gameplay matches the idea of keeping the game to it's roots. you still have to hunt for health and ammo through the game, but it doesnt feel like Wolfenstien 3D where you feel like you have to really search for ammo so you can actually kill Mecha Hitler. The way this game makes you search for ammo and food is wuite natural and you don't feel like you are really searching too hard for that 20+ health. There are secret areas so if you feel like straying off the path you can still get the old vibe. (but it doesnt force it on you which is refreshing) Great character flow and Gameplay.

I'm only 4 hours into Wolfenstein and I'm already recommending it. 'THE' definitive FPS of 2014. It may look like every other shooter under the sun, but it's not. From the health regen, to the perk system, to the speedy and brutal gunplay, to a cast you care about, and to the seamless transistions from gameplay to cutscenes, Wolfenstein pushes first-person-shooters past their original limits. Everything is implemented intelligently and with player experience in mind. A little disorienting at first as the controls and physics take some getting used to, but it all runs swimmingly before you can whine about it.  9.75/10",

It takes you along a rollercoaster ride displaying pure sadism whist having other little moments of happiness. The characters are believable and their interaction with each other makes for hilarious little moments - if you take the time to listen to their little convocations, that is. Baddies will have your stomach turn whist you may end up genuinely caring for (at least, some of) the good guys.  The gameplay feels like it should and has all the elements of a great shooter. Dual-wielding guns makes you feel like a goddarn tank and each weapon is interesting and feel satisfying in their own way. The music likewise is very fitting and adds an additional layer of depth to the game. Combined with the graphical style of the game; makes for a very solid feel.  9/10",

Maybe not worth full price but a must to grab on sale for some action packed blowing things up scenes and a nice little story.

Yet it has the current gen polish that smooths out what was rough with the genre from it's inception. You don't need to crutch on one or two guns due to limited ammo. The controls offer more depth to position yourself advantageously. Cover can actually be used, even if it isn't critical if you can hit the A and D keys.

It is up to B.J. and the resistance to crush the Nazis and take back the world. You get several various weapons, following the structure of older FPS games where you pick them up and unlock them as you go, but only the more unique weapons. You generally start every level with a knife, two handguns and another weapon, obtained in the story so I won't spoil it. I am personally having a blast with this game, even though I am playing it on the hardest-but-one diffficulty of 'I am Death Incarnate,' the hardest diffficulty of the first Wolfenstein games.

The whole story is, of course, a 'little' far fetched, but the way the environments, story, characters and their relationships are presented actually draws you into the story and makes you feel for them. There's a lot of side info that you can choose to read or listen to, which helps as well.   The characters are well put together. Anya, a character that you meet in one of the chapters may remind some of Alyx Vance from Half Life 2.   You run across collectibles throughout the game that actually unlock optional challenges.

Anyone complaining about how you have to press 'e' for every one time they pick up, just learn how to hit 'e' fast, it works just fine for me, because there aren't any items that you don't want to pick up. A lot of people don't like the linear aspects, but the game does give you the option to go guns a blazin' or take a stealthier approach, and it does appeal to these playstyles very nicely.

            "review_text": "This is the closest thing to a flawless game I have ever played. Each aspect of it is perfectly crafted, whether it's the story, the gameplay, the characters...  Let's start with the story. It is 1960, and the Nazis have won World War II. Everything we know about the free world has gone to hell and been replaced by a horrifying vision of what could have been. Down to the tiniest details, such as a Nazi-style Beatles album, or letters recounting the war, this is a fully fleshed-out world, and each twist and turn of this fast-paced tale hits you hard and makes you feel real emotion for what is happening. The setting and the level designs feel fluent and fitting in this grim reality, as do the look of the soldiers and weapons. There is a ton of background information you can discover about it as you progress through the campaign.  Next, the gameplay. Very much in tune with the original Wolfenstein games of old, The New Order feels like the perfect mix between modern and classic. The health system makes each leap from cover to cover suspensful, as you have to keep finding health packs and hidden rooms to stay alive as the futuristic soldiers fire at you. Also in vein with classic shooters, you have access to every gun you pick up at any time throughout the level. This leaves room for a lot of variety as you mow down evil soldiers. Yet, despite these more retro aspects of gameplay, the shooting and sprinting feels fast and responsive. Not once did I feel like I died because I was too slow, or got stuck. Also, almost every gun you pick up will get upgraded as you progress, adding insane features to your favorite weapon. Now, the one thing that was a little lacking was the stealth. It feels a little like it was added last minute, after they had designed the game to be a fast-paced shooter (which it is), and sometimes it can be annoying. But, it is still possible and very fun to sneak around and silently pick off guard dogs or commanders. In addition, The New Order has a very cool perk system, that unlocks new abilities as you carry out actions or takedowns in-game, and you can progress down a multitude of skill-trees, such as stealth or melee, or shooting to name a few.  Finally, the characters. Good god, the characters. Each one is a shining gem, sticking out uniquely in their own ways. They too, interact with the world around them, and have great dialouge/voice acting behind them. You begin to feel a bond with your friends, and an immense hatred for your ruthless enemies. Every nazi boss or major character is different, and by the end of the game, you will want to kill every last one of them. All of this character development is backed up by secret letters you can collect that talk about the characters, or audio logs that you can unlock. Nobody in this game feels flat, especially not your character, B. J. Blazckowicz. He is not the traditional, remorseless first-person-shooter protagonist at all. He feels regret, or sympathy, or disgust, or hatred. He too interacts with his surroundings and turns an already great game into an excellent experience.  All in all, you should definently play this. It has really changed the way I view first-person-shooters, and I feel like now I've been spoiled by this wonderful game.  ",

Pros: +Awsome graphics. +Amazing environment, very detailed. +The music and sounds throughout the game are incredible, Makes for an even more immersive gameplay (just crank up the volume when playing). +An old hidden version of the Wolfenstein game. +Weapons and weapons upgrade are very cool.   Cons: -Sections in a few levels are not that wel textured. -Voice synchronization sometimes out of sync. -Going down a ladder is very poorly, you basically fall down and lose health. -AI is kinda stupid when doing stealth kills (even when next to them they don't react). -It took me about 44 hours to get every achievement, so on that note I find that the game it very SHORT!

The game is able to perfectly encapsulate and streamline everything that was fun about the previous games in the series.   The gameplay is perhaps the strongest element as it is extremely well designed and goes back to an older style of action/FPS where any level can have multiple paths and approaches; essentially creating small linear playgrounds. With extremely satisfying gunplay with perfect hit detection and enjoyable stealth sections.  The game achieves an amazing aesthetic as both the audio and the visual design work perfectly to complement and convey the narrative and setting. I found that the games amazing visual design with a massive amount of care, detail and thought allowed for such a rich and interesting atmosphere to be created within the game. Events in the story are often able to tug at my emotions, either making me sad or making me incredibly pumped. It should also be mentioned that the graphics are amazing and 100% on par with todays modern standards.   This is a game that will both appeal to every last bit of nostalgia in you while also keeping you guessing every step of the way with an interesting premise. In my opinion it is a 10/10 and undoubtably worthy of being in ones game library.  ",

The game has so many strengths going for it: amazing music, fantastic voice actors, dialogue that isn't cheesy, and the reason we play such games; solid enjoyable gun-play. I personally think that their devotion to single-player only is what allowed for such a well rounded experience.   I want to get the 'cons' out of the way, as they are few, and really are more quibbles than anything. The story, at points, feels a little rushed. Could have used a little slower pacing. The shotguns, while pretty devestating, sound and feel a bit underwhelming, especially when compared to the assault rifle. Then again, the Brutal Doom mod has set the personal bar in regards to how shotguns should sound.   I think the game blends very well elements of 'old-school shooters' and the current mechanics of todays. The health system is like that of Far Cry 3's: each health 'chunk' (5 in this case, each worth 20 health) regenerates within its own 'chunk'.   I also like how it brings elements of the old-school in regards to the levels. To survive, you need to find health kits, armor, ammo, and so forth. There's also a lot of hidden goodies to find; secrets, as they used to be called. The levels are well varied and nicely designed.   I could go on with all the various nuances with the game, or how many great homages it pays; especially with the final boss. I can't decide between my two favorite moments: dropping acid with Jimi Hendrix, or finding the mattress to have a nightmare, and have it be Wolfenstein 3D.",

Love the art and the gunplay is fantastic, this game proves that you don't need an open world sandbox game to have a great experience.   Keep in mind, there is no multiplayer for this, so if you are looking for a robust multiplayer experience look elsewhere. Also lots of people report preformance issues while running this game. I run an upper tier system and get 60 frames at ultra settings, but every computer is different. Also the game does seem to have a memory leak, so after a few missions my framerate drops, but I just stop playing come back and it is fine.  Also while I have not finished the main story yet I have heard that the campaign is short. about 10ish hours.

            "review_text": "Shooters of today are dumbed down and force you along a linear path which feels more like a chore than a game. Wolfenstein The New Order is a call back to when shooters were supposed to be fun and engaging. You can dual wield any gun in the game and the stealth kills are different if you have one knife or two. You carry every gun from the start of the level to the end unlike other shooters with only two weapon swapping. Not only can you backtrack for ammo and health but you can run around looking for collectables and newspaper articles which give you story. You can see how many collectables are in the level and where they can be found on the map, which is a nice touch. The game doesnt hold your hand or bug you every five seconds about the mission and you can run around the level without consequence. The sounds of the game are top notch and should be turned up. The guns in the game have a fair amount of recoil and have the distinct sound of firing a weapon. Everything just feels right when you are firing dual shotguns at your enemy.  The two downsides that i will say arent that great are 1.) The perk system is kind of tacked on and feels cheap but on the bright side if you die (or reload) all of the progress on the perk tree stays with you. So you could grind out perks that you want and you dont have to progress the story if you dont want. 2.) There isnt any saving just checkpoints. On the bright side the checkpoints are very close together so you never lose a half hour of gameplay.  As the story unfolds you get to see what the Nazis were infamous for during WW2. This game shows and tells you a lot of very literal things that are historically accurate even if this game is set in fiction. The portrayal of what the Reich did to people and the fear, pain, and misery they instilled into the world is clearly on display. The times may be different (in game) but the evil things that the Nazis do is nothing new. This game, for me at least, makes me want to be a better person in spite of all the dehumanizing things that happen. It makes me want to help somebody i dont know because its the right thing to do.  There was some setbacks at launch, but as with any new game it will be patched out. The game feels right at home on the PC with no distinguishable console features.  All in all its one of the best run and gun games to come out in a long time. You can see that the game wasnt just another carbon copy of CoD but a game made out of love for the genre. This game may not be the game of the year but it has a lot of heart. The hype and marketing campaign comes with any triple A game and while its not the be all end all of shooters it is a well crafted game that does the Wolfenstein name proud. IMHO this game is worth the money.",

Same can be said about the story, which is surprisingly well written and is not just another war shooter with Hitler in the main role (no Hitler at all in this game).  Graphics are really well done, but do not push your PC to the point where you do not get constant 60 FPS, or else you are going to have a bad time with a game of this kind.

Well, the New Order is the real deal, delving into the blackest pit of Nazi ideology and giving the game an immersive and dark atmosphere.  The gameplay is very good but not super-amazing-fantastic. You point your gun, enemies die. You sneak around, enemies die. Nothing ground-breaking, but it's notably smooth and makes for an enjoyable gaming experience.

            "review_text": "I will start off by saying this is the best game I have ever played.  I have played other games for longer. I have had more fun and laughed more from other games. But I can say without a doubt this game is the best I've ever played.  Wolfenstein: The New Order is a brilliant game. It's a thrill ride of ups, downs, and killing Nazis. The story is one of the best I've ever seen a game, and it's blend of adrenaline-pumping action with genuine moments of sadness and regret from the characters is very rare in a modern-day FPS. It expresses the true machinelike evil of the Nazis, and people dogged resiatance to them. Even in the darkest moments of the game, someone will always bounce back. Although it' s fictional(duh) and contains some fantasy elemenst (Jewish superweapons, anyone?), the story hits home with every one of us. Although we are thrust into the story just like that, Aas we sneak our way through each level and then inevitbaly screw up, get caught, and bring out the dual-wield laser guns and automatic shotguns, we begin to understand what we are fighting for: freedom, and what we are fighting against: oppresion, imprisonment, gruesome cruelty(this gmae lives up to it's ESRB rating, and not in a good way) and of course, Nazis. The end, although bland, still left me in shock and awe from just everything this game has to offer. There were times when I almost felt like crying(as much as a game can make you cry), and throughout it all it was evident everyone was suffering(including the protaganist). The story is beyond anything else you will likely see in another FPS for a while. It's great.  Gameplay wise, Wolfenstien offers some refreshing mechanincs will still keeping true to the classic FPS elements that make the genre so popular. It offers plenty of options to stealth around; when the enemies start rolling in it offers some serious firepower. Nearly every weapon has an unlockable alternate firing mode and can be duel welded. With the lasercraftwerk, this game's equivalent of the gravity gun, you can do all kinds of stuff as you find new attachemnts for it, although its feels a little limited due to specific surfaces you can use it on. It also can provide a helping hand when your low on ammo and need a boost in firepower. The manual leaning is much preferable to an automatic system, although the controls are a little strange. I especially liked the no nonsense health value; get shot and the number goes down, get one the various helath kits in the game and the number goes up, if its gets to 0 you die. The armor is the same. Although a little unrealistic(especially with the armor), its provides a refreshing idea instead of the overused 'immersive' health. Stealth is also quite good. Sneaking behind walls and shooting commanders when no one is looking gives me a thrill like no other. An early game choice determines whether you use stealth/lockpicking(my choice) or explosives/grenades(I think). Overall, some refershing ideas give the game a different look and feel then most FPS's.   Now that my glowing review is over, we get to the not so great parts. Its just a couple so I made a list instead.      Towards the end of the game, I felt like it fouced more on heavy firepower than slinking throught level with stealth. I'm a huge fan of stealth so it got a little much towards the end(but it wasn't really that bad, just my personal preference)    Technology wise, the game has some major issues. A 50 gig download is unacceptable for a 10 hour game. It leads to horrendously long downloads for people with bad internet, and I couldn't put it on my SSD, making load time quite long, which got old real quick when i was restarting multiple times as I neared the end.    The game has some audio issues where the sound will mute if you fire different guns quickly, but this only happened four or five times.    It also has some texture pop issues. I only noticed it once but it was really obvious and broke the immersion. Other reviewers seem to state it happens more often.    Finally the game's cutscenes are frame capped at 30 Fps. It's not awful, but its definetaly noticable when lots of things are flying around.   Overall this game is thrilling, adrenaline-pumping, and a little bit disheartening. Some things the Nazis do in the game are quite appaling, but they really show the cold killing machine they were. Plus you kill an absolute buttload of them. When you take away the story, the mechanics, the characters, all the AAA fluff, this game is about killing Nazis. And that's a game I'd like to play.",

It ran well on my i7 + GeForce 760.  Unfortunately the ennemies are beyond stupid. Nazis will walk right by the dead body of one of their own (that I killed silently) and do nothing. Dumb AI... There is a lack of diversity in the guns: Knife (that you can throw), pistol, riffle, shotgun, marksman and somekind of laser type of gun.

            "review_text": "I'm first going to start with a personal opinion on Wolfenstein: The New Order. It is an extremely great game, with a marvellously well-written plot, and packed to the brim with intensive action shooter scenes, in which you have to fight as if your life really depended on it. The game is well worth the money spent and is even better when discounted. The mix between old school and new school make this game a well-balanced one between the old Wolfenstein, and the new series of Wolfenstein.  Pros are as follows:  1) Great detail on the environment itself, the textures and effects are very clear and enjoyable.  2) Action scenes will make sure you don't get bored of any mission you play, and even offers you a selection between Stealth and Guns Blazing to get the job done.  3) The story itself is a magnificently written one, with characters each with their own personalities, histories and conflicts.  4) Vast range of weaponry, featuring multiple attachments or gadgets will greatly increase the variety at which you might want to deal with your enemies. Just crush them all, no matter how you do it.  5) The range of enemies is vast, and they are not some sort of stupid AI, they will know how to deal with you and will prove to be a challenge. True, some may work with a pattern, but some enemies are smarter than others and will be unpredictable, this means more of a challenge, but making it fun to expect the most from every shooter.  6) If the game's soundtrack also affects your playing experience, I can tell you there is some beautifully suitable music worthy of a Wolfenstein game, adapted perfectly to every scene.  7) Brutal, graphic, gorey but very, very, very, very enjoyable and fun to play.  Cons are as follows:  1) Sometimes it may feel as if the game slows down a bit. Yes, it does do that about twice throughout, but thankfully not frequent.  2) Even though brutal and graphic is a Pro, it can also be listed as a con for those who don't have as much a strong stomach. So be prepared.  3) Sometimes Wolfenstein trying to be both the old and new Wolfenstein may get a little bit in the way and you might find the game to go off track, but luckily, this is just a minor con, and you can quickly get back into the feel exactly as you want it.  So that's my review on Wolfenstein: The New Order, hope it's informative and will help you consider getting this game, it's well worth the price, and well worth the effort put into it to make it one of the best shooters out there, and forever be out there.",

Unfortunately, while it does have old-school shooter vibes like health packs, the ability to hold lots of guns, and hidden secrets, there is simply not enough sequences where you get to explore the levels as extensively as those masterfully crafted levels in Return to Castle Wolfenstein and Wolfenstein 2009. It is more cinematic than the older games, but I think it lost some of it's old-school gaming feel for some more linear sequences.  While I would prefer a remaster of RTCW (using the WTNO engine and mechanics) over this, the game is still all out fun and worth at least 2 replays. ",

As far as single player FPS campaigns go, one of the best i've played in a long time. Highly recommend.

            "review_text": "Let me start by saying; If you have a AMD graphics card like me - you might have some problems getting the game to run smoothly. It only took me 20 minutes though to find out what things I needed to do to get the game to look good and run smoothly - it's not that hard and there is a lot of tutorails and help you can get. Not all AMD cards will have the same problems as I did though.  The story is interesting and the characters are GREAT - usually in a shooter I don't care about any characters but in this game they all have very charming personalities and interesting stories. The shooting feels very good and satisfying - there's a lot of guns and you don't have a limit of how many you can carry (which is rare in modern shooters). There are some missions which kind of force you to play stealthy, but that's alright because those missions involve a lot of story development.  When it comes to how the game looks the textures are not that great, even on Ultra it still looks like a game from 2011. The aesthetic of the game however is very good. And the animation, even on the characters, is better than most games. So what the game doesn't have in texture quality it makes up with great aesthetic and animation quality. Personally graphics have never mattered a lot to me as long as they're not terrible - which they are not at all.   Sound design is through the roof. Very good indeed. The voice acting is very good.  Even though the game doesn't have multiplayer (which it doesn't have to have) it still has extra game modes you can unlock. The difficulty of the game is as it should be - there are 5 difficulties, if you pick the easiest you'll get easy, and if you pick the hardest you'll be dying a lot. As you'd expect. There are multiple ways to get to the goal in missions, and you get to chose between being stealthy or being Rambo most of the time. Health regeneration is in there in a very small portion - you can only regenerate 20 health, then you have to find health packs in the level. Which is a nice compromise between the way old shooters did it and the way modern shooters does it.  I recommend Wolfenstein: The New Order to any shooter fans. Because it's a DAMN GOOD shooter with a fantastic story with fantastic characters to support it.  Gameplay: 9/10 Story: 9/10 Graphics: 7/10 Animation: 8.5/10 Sound: 10/10 Overall Game: 9/10",

Even when played on the normal difficulty, this game is challenging and will have you repeating certain areas until you come up with a good strategy.   The variety of weapons is fun and its sci-fi setting allows greater freedom in what your arsenal consists of. For example, you can use a laser rifle that when locked onto an enemy will leave a bloody pulp of mass.

This has been said many times before, but it really is nice to see the return of several old-school shooter characteristics. Dual-wielding guns, hunting for secrets, finding armor and health packs, planning routes around levels with a map instead of walking down continuous hallways broken up by firefights. I'd forgotten how fun these kinds of games can be.  A lot of games also tout a play-your-way format while having one thing in mind and punishing you for doing something different. TNO could have fallen into this trap and offered an action shooter with stealth elements reluctantly included, but the aforementioned open maps lend themselves for run-and-gun or stealth play. I appreciate this for the replay value alone.  In terms of shooting, you can't go wrong with this title. There is a nice selection of weapons, and upgrades along with skills add further options. Gunplay feels visceral, further compounded by large amounts of actual viscera. In the end, that's all this game had to do to accomplish its goal, and it does this well. Add in the future elements, and we're really in business now.  I leave you all with a quote from B.J. which, in my opinion, sums up the game pretty well:  '♥♥♥♥ you, Nazi ♥♥♥♥ing spaceman.'",

PROS:  * Amazing alt-1960 story  * Stunning graphics -- some screenshots practially look like art.  * Wonderful soundtrack; subtle, but when it kicks in... damn.  * Game splits into two 'timelines' depending on a (very tough) early choice. This has a minor ripple effect throughout the rest of the game. Playthrough averages about 11 hours for one 'timeline'.  * Holy cow, this game visits almost every location you can imagine. I won't even spoil it.   CONS:  * Horrid texture and asset pop-in (like RAGE), but there are ways to minimize this that I won't get into. Google it.   * Additionally, textures sometimes do not load full-res. Or worse, some objects will render half with full quality, and the bottom half (for example) at low quality. Sometimes entire walls just stay low quality. And the compression artifacts stand out. (I did not try turning off texture compression in the graphics settings -- YMMV.)  * The game can sometimes be cheap by spawning in enemies behind you, even after you THINK you've cleared a room.

            "review_text": "Wolfenstein: The New Order is a 'soft reboot' of the Wolfenstein franchise, and as per tradition, you take control of William 'B.J.' Blazkowicz, but this time, there's more to the man than just brawn. The game delves into Blazkowicz's mind and though process, giving the player another dimension to his character and actually root for him and his motivations that develop throughout the story. This whole game revolves around a 'what if' scenario, if the Axis Powers, specifically The Third Reich. Within all of this chaos of the world becoming a hellhole and twisted upside down, Blazkowicz is tasked to stop the Nazi war machine, with one goal in mind, ending the figurehead General Deathshead.  The characters you meet are memorable in their own aspect and own motivations on why they fight the regime, and adds a real and evident human element to the gameplay. Even the Nazis are portrayed in a somewhat of a human light as they have casual banter and conversation here and there as you progress through the game. They go thoughout their lives caring for one another, but never for anyone outside their 'race'. You see a realistic, but not biased side of what the Nazis were in this game, which makes the world feel more real and believable. In the game also exists, newspaper clippings, records (that one can listen to) to add to more of the idea that 'a world like this could exists, here's what changes'.   The gameplay is nothing special, nothing innovative, everything works as it should, and very fluidly as well, but there's no mechanics that no one hasn't seen yet. Returning to classic FPS roots is the inclusion of a health system that requires attention when reduced, rather than just simply taking cover and recharging health, like most shooters now are today, which could be a good or bad thing, on one hand it forces one to take more care in enagaging enemies recklessly, and analyze where the next potential health drop is, and the other hand when health is scarce, one will constantly be obliterated by the heavily armed soldiers later in the game. There's also a intergrated perk system which is unlocked by attaining certain requirements in the game (headshot enemies to unlock, etc.)   It's a game that makes you wonder and think more and invest yourself in the story, rather than just running and gunning enemies (which you can do), which is what many games try to do nowadays, but sometimes falls short.   PROS -Well crafted narrative -Mostly memorable characters -Solid gunplay -Unique setpieces and environments that really give an idea of the world portrayed -Voice acting and performances on point -BAMF saving the world -Boss battles -Retro-futurism done right  -Realistic portrayal of characters and motivations -No holds barred look at the brutality and insanity of the enemy -No issues running game at 60FPS   CONS -Anticlimactic and lackluster ending  -Decisions really don't affect the story much -Textures are eh at times and pop in more so -Graphics are nice, but only in certain environments, otherwise its ok  -Pretty short campaign (longer than most, but still fairly short at 10-12 hours) -Gets a bit contrived and unrealistic towards the end of the game  -Dual wielding is nice but somewhat useless  Wolfenstein: The New Order doesn't do much to innovate, but that's because it's not trying to, it's trying to tell a story with refined modern mechanics in tandem with classic gameplay elements that harken back to the early days of FPS. It gets a lot of things right more than wrong. It's going to be the same gameplay you've seen before in every other shooter, but it's the story that will captivate and entertain you, so if you're interested in a good narrative with solid gameplay mechanics, then definitely go for this game, you will more than likely enjoy this game.

            "review_text": "I have to admit when I first heard that the Wolfenstein franchise was getting a reboot I had a number of mixed emotions. While the game was a bit before my time, I have to say that the thought of Bethesda remaking such an iconic series seemed unrealistic to me. Remembering how groundbreaking the first game was, I wondered how such a game could live up to it's legacy. Recreating this critically acclaimed franchise which had been virtually untouched for so long seemed like such a tantamount task for any developer to take on; but MachineGames pulled it off with it's hit: Wolfenstein The New Order.  Entering the Wolfenstein franchise as a new player I found myself to be quite entrigued by the immediate introduction into action in the game. having never played the previous games from the '90s I was unsure if I was going to enjoy the game or not upon first entry. Of course I'd seen the videos from E3 of all of the gameplay footage and such alike but I was unsure whether I would truly be imersed into the game or not. Well, I guess I found out later when four hours had passed and the sun was down. With this game I was expecting any old shoot 'em up action packed FPS, but I found myself pleasantly surprised at the end of the game. Set in a world where the nazis have conquered the planet after mystical occult powers lead them to their victor in WWII, the Nazi War machine now rules the globe. The main character B.J. Blackowitcz' main directive after somehow awakening from a decade and a half long state of paralysis is to find the resist and bring down the war machine. Now this might sound like your classic FPS however a combination of fantastic character immersion as well as a gripping plot development creates an experience which really gets you empathizing with the characters in the game. I couldn't stop playing this game and when I made it to the end found myself feeling very satisfied with the all around experience. I have to say that this game is a perfect embodiement of what I'm looking for in a modern day FPS. Looking forward to the next game!",

With that being said it was great how our beloved main character was developed and most of the side characters I found myself attached to a lot, especially when they died. Placing the game in the future was a fantastic idea and showing a world run by the Nazi regime was a great way to invoke critical thinking. The side enemy characters were also incredibly well done as well and makes for some very intense scenes. I'm not gonna sugar coat the gameplay though. It feels good and the constant change in environments helps keep it fresh, but you'll probably get a little bored of the gunplay after a while, but the environments and sneaking around will keep you hooked. It's best to play this game for a couple hours a day. There is a constant rotataion of new enemies and slowly you will find new weapons, so it helps a lot to keep it interesting. Overall I was suprised how great the game was, I'd give it a solid 8.5/10. I look forward any DLC/Sequels.",

Later stages at least on hard made you use a lot of your arsenal to make it through, which was cool since I normally just use 1 or 2 guns to get through games which gets boring. Also has some leveling system but I didn't realise it and didn't use it, so I guess there's some more variety there.  The story is there. It's good for wolfenstein which, you know isn't saying much. I didn't really care for it since it isn't anything very good. It doesn't get in the way of the gameplay though which is good. There are no Bioshock Infinite like moments where the story goes 'oh war is so horrible when will people learn' and then you slaughter a hundred dudes 2 minutes later. The ending was a bit dull, but the final stage overall makes up for it.  Took me around 10 hours to beat even though I died quite a lot, so I wouldn't buy it for 50€ or whatever it's normally.

The graphics look very nice, the audio is well done, the guns feel very good and the story is amazing.  The story see's the player take control of William 'B.J.' Blazkowicz, which anyone who has played Wolfenstein before will be familiar with. Blazkowicz suffers a critical head injury and this is where the main story point kicks in - Blazkowicz wakes up in 1960, 14 years after the start of the game, inside a insane asylum. In this alternate universe, the Nazi's won World War II and there is not a stretch of land on the planet that is not under their control. They have amassed a huge amount of futurisitic technology which will see the player engage with not only Nazi soldiers but armoured dogs, robots and drones.  The story of the game also tackles the grim reality of World War II and what the Nazi's in particular were trying to do. Without going in to too much detail some of the issues that the game tackles are; Concentration camps and PoW's, experimention and the brutality of war. Some of it is eye opening and some of it is genuinly just good story telling.  The gunplay feels great, the guns feel very meaty and as if you are firing your bullets with a lot of power behind them.

This is worth the money - I feel like some ID really put some serious thought and effort into making an enjoyable game.  Pros: Some truly uncomfortable horror scenes, compelling story, well-developed characters, highly destructible dynamic environments, satisfying gore, action straight out of a 80's Ahnold movie, and special effects worth writing home about. You will not get bored playing this game - it's clear that a lot of thought went into it. It even has a 'lite' stealth system and accompanying choices of how to strategically approach each situation. It also doesn't hold your hand through every individual scenario ala Call Of Duty (and this is coming from a COD fan.) While it is linear, there is a greater degree of choice involved here in how to attack it. The AI is very, very good. They're not shooting gallery pop-ups hiding behind a single piece of cover. They move to flank, stalk, investigate, retreat etc. Hide in a room to catch your breath for too long, and one of them will run up, throw a grenade inside, and retreat for cover again to flush you out.  Cons: It ate ♥♥♥♥ and crashed to desktop until I installed the latest AMD/Catalyst update. I have a high-end gaming-specific computer, and it still stutters frequently on the sound - particularly during in-game cut scenes. While not nearly as linear as COD, it is far from being as open-approach as Dishonored (which it seems to be getting frequent comparisons to for some odd reason.) No multiplayer of any kind - this would have been a badass co-op game.   In summary, if you're on the fence at all: BUY IT. As long as your system can support it, it's worth every penny to the devoted shooter fan.",

            "review_text": "Wolfenstein is not the old school FPS return to glory that it has been touted as, I am sad to say. It looks great, the weapons have a solid punch to them, and the esthetics are pretty damn nice, but about halfway through the game it all goes wrong. Everything becomes tedious and repetitive, as you reach the point where you've seen all there is to see when it comes to both weapons, enemies, and challenges, and things just become more of the same. While at first the game is reminicent of the old school shooter in the guise of a modern game, that at least I had hoped the game would be, soon the mini-bosses you face at first become standard and mundane bulletsponges that you meet in every level. And the gunplay of the game grows boring quite quick as well, despite there being the occational upgrade to some weapons that give them a new alternate function, as there aren't all that many weapons and for the most part you rely on just one or two weapons, unless you run out of ammo and have to switch to an alternate weapon until you pick up more ammo for the better weapon.   The game relies overly much on cutscenes to deliver the narrative, that at times are wonderful, but eventually turn tedious and overstay their welcome. They get in the way of the play of the game, cutting it off just as the flow is begining to pick up the pace and you get into the action. At times they are also infuriating, pointless, and serve no purpose beyond padding the length of the game. At one point you trigger a cutscene and get ambushed by an enemy, who then delivers a monologue that does nothing to serve neither the current mission nor the plot, then you turn the tables on your attacker, all in the same cutscene, then you get control back and get a Quick Time Event to kill your attacker. Why? Why would they include this? It slowed down the pace of what was supposed to be a rushed mission, and that is it.   Wolfenstein: the New Order has the chimes of greatness, and there are some rather impressive boss battles (though they are usually of the 'run around until you figure out the weakness/pattern of the boss'-variant while posing little danger and little challenge), but the second half of the game feels empty and rushed, filled with just 'more' of what you've already seen in the couple of hours. I did enjoy the game, but past the halfway point I was bored and completed it merely for the sake of completing it, not because it was challenging or because I wanted to see what came next. It must also be said that the game is short, even with the cutscene padding. I finished the game in just about 9 hours, and I have no intention of going for a second playthrough, despite the obvious choice-scene in the start of the game that just screams 'you should play the game twice and see the differences'. Sorry, MachineGames, but the game you made here is by no means interesting enough for that. I'd rather play Return to Castle Wolfenstein, that was much more fun.",

If the story had been good, the game would have been an awesome role-playing experience.

If they had improved the stealth mechanics to make backstabbing a real option, it could have had fun stealth bits. If the sex scenes hadn't fallen QUITE so far into the uncanny vallley, I could have been all 'hurr hurr boobs.'   But, no. The story is just plain stupid ('Hey, Blaszkowitz fell in a five-foot-deep hole! Instead of pulling him out, let's send him off to wander randomly in the sewers!'). You constantly get interrupted to go fire a turret gun, or bring somebody a folder, or listen to some crazy woman babble about the number nineteen. The sneaking is kind of an 'eh, maybe you can take out one or two guys before the real shooting starts.' And, oh gods the horrible robotic boobs.

I had almost no fun playing this one.  PROS:  - A cool premise for continuing the franchise.  CONS:   - Abyssmal level designs throughout. Run through corridors until you get to an open area, usually circular and repeat. There are only a couple of exceptions to this layout, one being a destroyed train amidst the rubble of a bridge which is actually the only level I semi-enjoyed.   - You go to the moon to fight Nazi's, super cool idea, but you only get to play on the actual moon for a minute and then you only have a few flying drones you can take down and then you're back into another corridor.  - Not one but two horrible sex scenes that are so out of place, they're ridiculous. Did this game really need that? Nope. It cheapens the series.  -Tries too hard to be 'deep' BJ's ramblings made me want the Nazi's to win  - Missed opportunities. The moment you're going to town in a mech suit is cool but you're in a confined space and it's over as soon as it begins.    - Tedious one man submarine sequence. It felt tacked on as did all the underwater stuff.  - Scavenger hunts. I understand in a FPS wanting to slow things down but at least it can be a fun diversion. I would have rather had the option to play with crayons and draw something in dum-dum's room than to look for crap for all these lazy NPC's.  At the end of the day, this game is, for me anyway, a HUGE disappointment because it does nothing exceptional or outstanding and doesn't introduce anything really new or interesting into the genre or franchise. There are some cool ideas but they're squandered aimlessly and, at the end of it all, there's just nothing memorable or even good about it.    4 out of 10 ",

The story was interesting and well written. Set in 1960, the Nazis have won World War II, and B.J. Blazkowicz, the protagonist of the Wolfenstein series, must engage in cold-blooded Nazi killing. It doesn't matter; they're Nazis! I preferred the game at the beginning, when it was in 1946, but that's what The Old Blood is for. That is not to say I didn't enjoy the game, however.

            "review_text": "I enjoy Wolfenstein The New Order and despite a few bugs and the fact it can sometimes be confusing as to where to go if for some reason the HUD dissapears, the game was excellent. I enjoyed the amount of effort the developers put into the game and overall, it is balanced and fun even if a little excessive and unrealistic.   Pros:     The enemy actually speaks in German and for the most part, is highly accurate for the time period.    The campaign and storyline are well done, you enjoy the NPCs contribution and particularly for me with Max Hans, actually found it a little sad. I think the developers did a stupendous job on this part and is one of the key selling points for the game.    Easter Eggs, Easter Eggs, Easter Eggs!    Destructible environment is wonderful and most of them doesn't have the annoying fails where you think you're aiming over a wall but in fact you're just shooting into it sometimes, pretty sure everyone has had this problem at one point or another.    Relatively good graphics and scripting even during phases where everything is moving extremely fast or flying everywhere. It was a rare occurence I saw distortion or rendering failures   Cons:    Ending left a lot to be desired in my opinion especially in how it seemed you could do very little to effect the final outcome when it gave the appearance you could possibly have multiple endings.    You can die while moving on elevators if you jump and the elevator comes back up to you before you fully land....I died probably seven times to this glitch even though it was hilarious.    Only one Hiel Hitler quote in the entire game....I mean seriously, this is about Nazis and all I ever hear is Deathshead this, Deathshead that...what ever happened to trying to kill Hitler and foiling his plans. Granted if you aren't in the USA, you probably won't even hear the word Nazi or even see a Swaztika so this can be a small point for most people.    Large buildup to the midpoint of the game and then a very fast climax. I was expecting the game to be a little bit longer and even though it was fun and all...I was dissapointed in how quickly you could beat it.    Collectible locations are sometimes rediculously hard to find or figure out unless you're either a pro at doing these or are cheating.   Final Verdict: 9/10 because no game is perfect and I wanted there to be at least a DLC expansion which might came out...we never know. Yet its downfalls weren't big enough to make it unenjoyable. Great game, definetly get it when on sale if you are a fan of first person shooters, Nazis, or being able to dual wield weapons because reasons.",

Took me 12 hours to finish on hard difficulty so it wasn't even all that long for a 50€ game. Luckily I got it on sale for 7€. I'd be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ if I would have paid full price for something like this.  There is some stealth elements in the game where you can sneak around but it has been done quite poorly. Since you can only move along this one route there is no going around and flanking. If you use silenced pistol or throw the knife you wont alert enemies even if they are standing right next to one another and you kill one of them right in front of the others.  Story was quite stupid with all the typical cliché last second saves and 'surprise' plot twists with dumb action parts what you can expect to see on every B movie.  Game looked pretty good, sounds were ok and shooting was rather satisfying but other than that I dont really see anything else good in it. Cannot recommend this title even if its on sale.",

        {
            "review_text": "I beat the whole game in about 9 hours on the normal difficulty (I switched it to the easiest difficulty towards the very end just so I could be done with it).  Great looking visuals, immersive sound, halfway decent voice acting for an FPS game, but the gameplay is just too flawed to make this an actually fun game.  Shooting in this game is the best part! Then you have many long segments where you aren't shooting or you aren't supposed to shoot - hunting around for stuff like this is Ether One or Dear Esther (for example, there's a section where you're looking for mold - I'm not kidding), or sneaking around with limited weapons. First of all, this is a problem because I got this game thinking it would be an intense, fast paced FPS. When you throw in these inane 'look around for something' quests and these slow-paced stealth sections, you're keeping me from doing what I want to do with my limited free time. Second of all, the stealth gameplay is just not fun. It's not even a problem with the mechanics of stealth in this game, it's just that sneaking around, waiting, and sneaking some more isn't really fun when you're looking for an intense, fast-paced experience.  But, even if they got rid of all that other stuff, they managed to mess up the shooting gameplay as well. At first, when they only have the weak enemy types that go down in a few hits, the game is quite fun. Even with that, though, the guns they give you aren't really precise, so even if you're aiming down the sights, it's not easy to pull off those headshots, giving you less of that feeling of mastery and control that you can get from other FPS games. That's fine if running and gunning is a viable tactic, but if you do that, it seems you'll take lots of damage and you have to find medkits to heal yourself. I know people claim to hate regenerating health, but I honestly would've had more fun if, during combat, I could just run and gun, hide for a bit to heal up, then do it some more. There's a lot of other ways to fix that annoyance than regenerating health, though.  More about the combat - as I said, when there's weak enemies that go down in a few hits, it's fun. However, they quickly start introducing heavily armored enemies. They kinda have weak points, but it's still going to be a frustrating experience taking them down. It's just not fun when you have to empty entire clips into enemies, even if you're hitting their weak points, until they fall down. It ruins the fun pace of the game because you have to pop out, shoot, then duck back behind cover, and repeat until they're dead. You can't just run and strafe and shoot because you'll just take too much damage. It's possible I was not clear on what parts of these enemies were 'weak points' or what the best strategies were for taking down these enemies - I would blame that on the game's lack of clear feedback and guidance. These enemies occur way too frequently, and they continuously introduce stronger and stronger enemies that take more and more time to take down. It's just not fun. Compare this to games like Bulletstorm, Call of Juarez, or Shadow Warrior. They manage to keep the challenge up while still making the combat satisfying.  Also, the weapon switching is atrocious. I think you should've been able to switch weapons while the game is paused. They give you so many different weapons, which is great, but because of how weapon switching works, you'll find yourself not feeling like you should ever switch it up unless you run out of ammo. Why give players lots of weapons if you don't give them an easy way to decide between them and switch?  Also, I know people complain about modern games 'hand holding' players, but if it improves the fun-per-minute, I'm all for it. In the case of this game, there were many times where I wasn't sure where I was supposed to go so I had to spend time wandering around. That's just not fun. When you have a limited time to play games, you want to spend it having as much fun as possible - so if they did a better job of indicating where to go, the game would've been at least less annoying.  So, overall, the FPS combat is the best part and it's rife with gameplay issues that make it frustrating and unsatisfying. The parts that aren't FPS are even worse - they are boring, slow, and totally not what you would want if you're looking for a fast, exciting FPS. However, I did at least enjoy the story, writing, voice acting, and animation during the cutscenes - the characters were memorable and their faces when talking didn't look too 'off'. Also, the visuals and sound in this game are quite polished and really help with the immersion. However, there just isn't the same intelligence, ingenuity, and creativity in the actual gameplay design.   I primarily recommend a game based on the amount of fun I have for the time I am playing the game. Wolfenstein: The New Order, only manages to be fun about 20% of the time through the game, so look elsewhere for a fun, fast-paced, thoughtfully-designed shooter.",

It's not the longest game, or the best in terms of mechanics/content. However, the story is truly amazing. Very few games these days have the kind of quality and writing that this game does.   The gameplay is definitely fun, I wanted to be able to play more of the missions stealth-only. The game is fairly short, it only took me around 13 hours to beat on the hardest difficulty. I bought this game on sale for around $10, which was more than worth it. I would've been willing to pay $30, but the $60 price tag is a little much for how short the story is. As with all games there are a few minor things that could be made better, but mostly I enjoyed the hell out of this game.  I give it a 9/10.

But the setting of the game was different and fantastic! What if the Germans had won WW2 and how would they have went about doing so? This game does well in perceiving that scenario. It even adds small details in newspaper articles of alternate historic events. Characters in the game were above-average, considering some of them came from previous Wolfenstein renditions and I vaguely knew anything in regards to their back stories. In regards to gameplay it comes in at about an average rating. The mechanics or no different than your other typical shooter game. By the time I finished the game, I found the laser-cutter to be redundant. You have to scroll-wheel to choose weapons also, which I found to be atrocious and annoying when you are being bombarded by AI guns. Mostly played for nostalgic reasons, but I would recommend this game to others, it is a solid buy. 7/10",

I would love to see another game set in this world, it was so compelling and there was a massive world not wrapped up in just one game.(I wouldn't mind one starring the Anya character.)  For some reason the game isn't listed as having full controller support, but works just fine with the Xbox 360 controller.  No multiplayer, but honestly this game is worth the price without it.",

The game is fairly repetitive in the fact that the missions are basically killing Nazis and stealing stuff just in different settings (for the most part) 3. Pretty damn gruesome like you blow peoples heads off, you watch a crazed General gouge the eyes out of a friend and then watch him dill a hole in his head and extract his brain.  4. Though the missions are very fun there are only 16 and a few are just walking around the base HQ or whatever ya wanna call it. Then you know there will be missions you do not like.  5.NO MULTIPLAYER.  6. No DLC (yet)  Even with the cons I did mention the game is still very fun and I would reccomend it but if you would have a issue with any of the 6 cons I listed above then be warned.",

Each character that fights alongside you has their own narrative, their own reasons to topple the Nazi empire. As for the villains that stand in your way, they might as well be demons who don human skin to carry out Hell’s wishes. You will come to despise them. The tools used to kill these monsters are derived from both the mundane and fanciful, these being assault rifles and lasers. There is no shortage of ways to carry out your grisly work.

Everything from the story, gameplay, graphics are extremely well made and presented. To get the boring stuff out of the way, the visuals of the game are incredible and really do bring out a next generation feeling with its well made models, sleak areas and weapons and spectacular violence gibs that go flying through out the game!   The story is surprisingly great! Due to being single player only, a lot of detail went into the world and enviorments that you go through, and because of that you can really get sucked into the games world that it presents! Characters are all well done and overall Machine Games did an amazing job pulling off this end. But now for the most important of everything here; the gameplay.  The gameplay is just friggin rad! It combines classic FPS elements and modern elements and creates this incredible game which I hope future developers look to when making future titles. The game allows for stealth in some sections, which comes off as a nearly perfected feature for players of many tastes. In those stealth sections, you can go guns blazing if you want to, but the stealth is fast, quick, strategic and very enjoyable overall because of it! The health system is perfected with this balence of old and new, using health kits to heal up while you still have regenerating health. The overcharge ability for your health is also great since it turns those useless health items you find in secret areas into useful tools to create more destruction against the Nazis! Its incredible to finally get back into the old school way of hunting for healing items!  The gunplay is one part that got me sucked in the moment I saw footage for the game, and it does not dissapoint. Its fast, frantic and gives you some crazy adrenaline rushes at times! Its old school shooting from way back in the day but its back in the modern day, combining big, powerful weapons to use against armies of foes and giant bosses! You can acquire upgrades too, which give you more advantages to some of your guns. But dang, it is so much fun duel wielding two large machine guns and unloading them on unrelenting enemies!  The AI is challenging too, so where ever that odd rumor is coming from it needs to pipe down, cause enemies will actually use cover, get together to gang up, will crouch and shoot at you if you are under neath floors, its great! There are also perks you can gain from doing certain actions through the game. Some are absolutely easy while others may be extremely annoying (See the Assault Rifle Perk). The cover system they put in the game is very handy for taking out those foes who can mess you up if they see you for a second.  And the boss battles. Not gonna go into too much detail, but DAMN! It is great to see bosses again, like actual boss fights, not some QTE bull crap or something else that doesn't involve a fight or gameplay. These bosses are awesome, powerful and really rad when you see them and destroy them! The final boss in particular is what I personally have been waiting for after a long time in FPS gaming. An actual big bad you get to face down rather then mash the space bar or tap the hell out of X because the game devs were too lazy or wanted some kind of 'real' fight. Bleh! This game gets it right on every angle!  Just overall, the game play is pheonominal. Combine that with the good story and amazing visuals, you have yourself a fantastic title. Its well worth the $60 USD, but if times are tough for you, nab it during a sale, it will be worth every penny; believe me. Over all I give this game my highest of reccommendations and if you can, buy it now!",

The decision to make it single player only was fantastic, each level was interesting and different with multiple routes to take and varying strategies to execute. The graphics and audio are superb and the story was really deep and at times some one must have been cutting onions nearby because my eyes kept watering up.  I've seen a few people complain about the enemy A.I and all I can say about that is they must have been playing on an easy difficulty because the A.I was really challenging on Death Incarnate. When I went back and replayed on the easy mode to pick up the collectable items I previously missed, the A.I did seem pretty dumb but what else would you expect on a difficulty called 'Can i play daddy?'.  The weapon selection is good, you don't have massive selection but each weapon has a role to play and I found myself using the best weapon for the situation more often that not, rather than just sticking with my favourite. Each one felt different and took a bit of experimenting to find it's strengths and weaknesses.  The replayabilty is good which is something often lacking in single player games these days. The two different time lines mean you'll want to play it at least twice and then you'll probably want to go back through again to pick up the collectables/ finish of the achievements. Also when you crack the enigma codes you unlock some bonus game modes which seem really fun and challenging, I'm taking a bit of a break before I take on the 'Ironman' mode.  Overall this game has restored my faith in the FPS genre and given me hope that more developers will realise that there is a market for these types of shooters and not just the generic online shooters riddled with microtransactions.  10/10 great job guys I hope you do a sequel.",

Although the game allows the player a majority of the time to choose how to play the game, it does, at times, force the player to use the stealth system orthe fast paced action system. When this does happened it doesn't feel forced, but instead feels more like a fluid transition from one play style to the other.   The characters and cutscenes in Wolfenstein are interesting, exciting and have a certain depth to them that many modern fps games lack. The story has an underlying theme about the treatment of certain peoples during World War II, and although Nazi's never created giant robots they are god damn fun to kill, and each enemy is well-balanced. When playing on the hardest difficulty the levels require a certain sense of creativity to beat which makes the game even more fun.  The scenery in Wolfenstein is only okay, but what makes the graphics interesting and different is the rather subtle filter applied to it.

Gun play is tons of fun, progression system is cool, challenging you to do things you wouldn't normally do. The story is honestly very good. It's captivating, in depth, and even emotional at times.

The devs have done a great job immersing you in the world, and creating a cast of antagonists that you just can't wait to kill. Back to the gun play, it's over the top and rightfully so. In fact, everything about this game is fairly over the top. The boss fights (which are lacking just a bit, but still fun), the story itself, the voice acting, and how your character manages to experience wounds that would kill any normal person, but he manages to brush it off. The story offers replayability as well. In the beginning you make a very tough choice that has repercussions on the story later on. Overall, this is a must-have. It's hard for me to recommend anything for 60 dollars but if you're looking for something new and you don't mind spending that much, don't hesitate.  The game took me roughly 10 hours to beat, Steam only recorded 7.5 for some reason.  8/10",

I prefer a solid SP or MP game rather than two sub-par halves crammed together.  As far as the game goes, id Tech 5 is a wicked engine. Some deformable terrain, damage realistically displayed on enemies (sometimes graphically so, as the energy weapons later on will show), without being terribly system-demanding, and always seemed smooth. I find it worth noting I never once had any glitches or slowdown in this game. Truly a rarity these days (especially when Bethesda is involved, COUGH COUGH).  The story is quite interesting, and even though some of the characters are a bit flat and undeveloped at times, and there's a couple of instances where for the sake of plot you need to suspend your disbelief, it's fairly believable. Plus, you get to shoot space Nazis on the ♥♥♥♥ing Moon. With lasers. It's like Stanley Kubrick directed 2001: A Space Odyssey with Nazis in it. And lasers.  The gameplay is top-notch. Everything is fluid, from movements, to context sensitive abilities like vaulting, and the stealth/cover systems are as about as non-cumbersome as you can get. You're not stuck to surfaces, and can transition quickly from cover to cover. Not that it's necessary to; unlike that one section everyone remembers from Return to Castle Wolfenstein, stealth in this game is entirely OPTIONAL. It may make your life easier, such as in taking out Commanders to prevent them from calling reinforcements, but you can also just dual-wield and mow down everything that lives. Gunplay in this is absolutely BRUTAL. Dismembered limbs, exploding heads, exploding bodies, stabbing people in the face, chest, temple, leg...if you've ever wanted the definitive Nazi-killing simulator, The New Order is it.",

The technical problems on PC when trying to activate basic functionality like MSAA were a big hassle, but more importantly, the old school teleportation solution to transitioning between levels felt really detrimental to the experience of playing the game.   For example the much hyped train story sequence - it looked really impressive in preview videos, but in the actual game the sequence felt crammed in between two levels. They tried to create an oppressive world, but the constant teleportation between story sequences and geographically distant locations (even using ridiculous stealth helicopters) made it really hard to immerse yourself in the world and feel the oppression.   I mean, imagine how effective that train sequence would have been if it had been preceded by escaping the military checkpoint of the previous level, hiding with a fake identity among other civilians, presenting forged paperwork to get on the train and getting to explore the train as a detailed location. All of this while being paranoid about being detected and with various stealth gameplay elements to make it possible to actually be detected. But instead of doing this, the game just cuts to the story sequence in question, which completely lacks tension as a result ...  Many of the levels that you 'teleport' to could have been edited to be physically connected to the resistance headquarters hub, which would have required some effort from the developer, but would have vastly improved the immersion into the game world. Exploring the secret tunnels around the resistance headquarters in some short missions was a really fun experience, and I just wish that the developer had made more of an effort to facilitate that kind of connectedness between the hub and all the missions in the game.",

Why do the visuals look like they're from 6 years ago, despite the game having super-heavy hardware requirements and 50GB (!!! WTF) install size.  Oh, and the reviews? Filthy lies, every single word. Let me quote from Wikipedia (and yes, I read this _after_ I tried to play the game):  'Reviews praised the combat mechanics of the game. Daniel Hindes of GameSpot felt that the intensity and variety of the combat in the game has granted the series 'a breath of fresh air,' and believes that it managed to fulfil his nostalgic expectations from the series. Metro's David Jenkins said that the combat in the game is the 'real deal,' and named it one of the best recent single-player shooter games. The stealth sections of the game also received praise, with Simon Miller of  VideoGamer.com  lauding the shooting and stealth mechanics, naming the former as 'solid.'  It's railroaded, heavily scripted run-forward-and-gun-things-down. Oh, but occasionally you get to perform a STEALTH TAKEDOWN from behind! With a knife! And the game won't even tell you when you can do it (except for the first time you're presented with an opportunity) - you have to GUESS! So novel!  'Colin Moriarty of IGN considered the narrative and characters one of the best points of the game, stating that it's where it 'really shines.' Metro's Jenkins also praised the story, stating that the mix of tones is 'bizarre but obviously intentional.' Bah. Dialogue feels like it's written by first year journalism students. Characters are wooden. Overall, D-, but ultimately F for not even trying.  'The graphical design of the game received commentary from reviewers. GameSpot's Hindes praised the visual design. Taljonick of GamesRadar stated that the game's level design contributes to his enjoyment of the shooting sequences. He also praised the size of the levels, enjoying the possibility of participating in a large gunfight 'with some sort of plan.' Digital Spy's Liam Martin shared mixed commentary on the design, noting that the character models are animated well, but the game is 'hardly a shining example of next-gen graphical potential.'  With respect to 'next-gen graphical potential', let me make this crystal clear. This game looks like a typical Xbox (360, that is) game ported to PC, in terms of visuals. Which is to say, crap if you compare it to any game that fully utilizes the potential of the modern PC graphics hardware. I have to note, though, that rendering water like that has been considered faux pas for, like, 7 years now. Since Crysis. The first one. [Have the makes of the game heard of that game, Crysis? They should probably check it out.]  Level design? There is one? There's a lot of pu-retty scenery, that's for sure, but the iron cage that you're confined to is small and highly linear, as usual. Did I already mention that this feels a lot like CoD singleplayer? Yeah, I thought so.  TL;DR: 0/5, don't waste your money. Wolf3D is better. Seriously.",

The story is bland and predictable, and the gameplay has absolutely nothing original to add to the genre, it was mildly enjoyable at first, but becomes tedious and repetitive after the first 20 minutes.   When you begin the game you start out with only a knife, and you assume that as you progress you will unlock more and more weapons to pummel Nazis with. It turns out, once you find the Assault Rifle, you have found the weapon you will use for the rest of the game. You end up with a selection of knife, AR, shotgun, pistol, LaserKraftWerk(LKW), and marksman rifle(A pitiful selection for an 'Shoot 'em up' game). The only two weapons that you get ammo often enough to use are the AR and the LKW, both of which are bland and unsatisfying. The Marksman was great fun to use, but over the 10 hour playthrough, I found maybe 30 bullets for it.  The LKW is used to lengthen the game like a teenager uses a thesaurus to meet the word count on his essay. You repeatedly have to use the laser cutter feature of the gun to carve holes in crates, in vents, and to cut chains. Instead of just opening vents like a normal game, you are forced to draw the hole with your laser, and once you have completed a loop, the vent falls out. This often leads to you not making a large enough hole, and having to trim the edges to fit through. I spent over an hour, in the HQ doing chores. You have to find toys, documents, and power tools for people around the HQ, and it is an absolute disgrace that a AAA game company would resort to such blatant Artificial Game Lengtheners(AGL).  The perks are useless, and through an entire playthrough, I only unlocked about half of them. One you must kill two enemies with a single grenade, but the game gives you grenades so infrequently, that when a 2-for-1 opportunity comes up, you are out of nades, not to mention you can only carry 2.  This game is an easy 2/10, one star for the fact that I actually completed the campaign, and one star for actually looking pretty nice. -8 for all of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that I would expect from some indiegogo/kickstarter developer to try and pull.

You're better off with Old Blood or Return to Castle Wolfenstein if you want to stick with a Wolfenstein game..otherwise get Metro 2033 or even Rage would be a better choice.   I played Old Blood before playing New Order thinking, 'It's a prequel, can't hurt to start at the beginning and continue with the really meaty juicy carnage of New Order afterwards'.....turns out it's the other way around. Old Blood is a much better executed game with more replay value. I actually re-installed Old Blood after beating New Order. So what went wrong? The atmosphere for one...for those that are rolling their eyes (AKA: I beat this game in 30 min on ULTA HARD MODE), atmosphere is BIG, if you zoom through games you probably don't care, but I like the little touches in the world where a little brain matter splattered on a wall leading to a hallway through broken glass and debris builds on the anticipation leading into the next room. New order has some of that but it's not immersive, the details just aren't there (not talking about the graphics), it feels hollow and souless for the most part . There are some RPG elemets that take you out of the rhythm of what happened previously and frankly, I could have done without (sewer segments/rebel hideout). Another small gripe, it would have been nice to keep your perks when you start a new game after beating it on UBER. Also the 'timelines' mechanic...does not really add to the replay value. Don't really care about either one of the characters to see what the difference is especially since the ending is always the same (an ending that is a let down and does not add to the replay value either). The 'future' weapons and settings.....also not that exciting. Nazis is space...ummm ok I guess, I'd rather watch Iron Sky. The weapons selections are ok...never really needed to dual weild knives or Handgun 1960's when you have a lazer chain cutter from hell that can one shot an enemy and rocket spewing machine guns. Also, it was a pain to have your guns removed from sections when you're working on your perks (not a fun way to encourage replay). Graphics are good, cutscenes are nice and the story is blah at best. If you have a big back catalog of unplayed games (especially after a good Steam sale event), skip this title, even with the Wolfenstein pedigree. You get more bang for you buck with Old Blood.

So this game really misses the mark, from a scripting and gameplay perspective. The scripting slows this game down too much.   It just doesn't flow well. If I wanted to feel like I'm moving through molasses, I'd...actually recommend this game. But I don't, so...",

            "review_text": "Wolfenstein delivers exactly what I expected, over-the-top nonstop Nazi killing fun. Not only does it successfully revive the father of all shooter video games, it stands its own as an excellent modern day shooter. You can peak from cover freely just by holding the cover button and leaning in any direction you desire, making it easy to quickly duck down behind cover and shoot around corners. You can also dual wield anything! Dual wield assault rifles, dual wield shotguns, dual wield freakin sniper rifles that transform into automatic lazer guns! This game is just nonstop, consistent fun.   The story offered in 'The New Order' is fantastic. There's great voice over work to be found by all the characters, and the actual plot was the most creative thing I've had the pleasure of experiencing in years. I don't want to spoil too much, because I went into this game knowing absolutely nothing about the story, and loved it even more. The characters themselves are all interesting and having the short Headquarters missions where you have to help them out before your next mission really helped you feel like you were a part of the story itself. All of the action leads up to a fantastic finale that I was more than satisfied with.   Now let's talk about the tech behind the game. Here's where we run into a few major issues. This game is optimized terribly. And I say terribly, because my framerates struggled in many areas despite the graphics not even looking that great. The explosions look like something you would see in a PS2 game. Just bland yellow puffs of smoke that are only recognizable as explosions because of the sound effect. This is unacceptable, especially for a game being sold on 'next gen' hardware. In addition to some poor effects work, there's many areas in the game where the textures look so bad that I was wondering if that game was supposed to have a cell-shaded look to it. But none of these graphical issues were as bad as the screen tearing. Despite offering a vertical sync option in the settings, this game screen-tears like nothing I've ever seen. It's very disorienting trying to search for ammo when the top half of your screen is looking the other way. I'm not quite sure what is causing this issue, and I'm sure if you used a 3rd party program to enable vertical sync, it may fix the problem, but hopefully this issue is officially fixed for the game given some time.   Now let's talk about the gameplay. Make no mistake, just like it's predecessor, this is a LINEAR shooter. However, the developers managed to slip in some creative approaches to areas. I enjoyed having the option to find a secret metal grate that I could use my welding torch on so I could sneak into an area high above the enemies, and steathily take them out one by one to prevent reinforcements from arriving. There are several different paths in and around areas which makes for some great strategic planning and offers some replay value. Not only that, but the game is completely flooded with collectables hidden everywhere. And these aren't your simple types of modern day secret areas.. these are oldschool secret stashes that only the most seasoned oldschool shooter fan will know how to find.   So despite it's few technical issues like screen-tear and poor graphic quality, wolfenstein holds its own in a world diluted with first person shooters due to its fantastic gameplay mechanics and surprisingly creative story. Don't miss out on this one, this is your only chance to kill plenty of dem nazis.",

            "review_text": "FUN MIXED WITH DISSAPOINTMENT --------------------------------------  While being very much fun at times, this game overall fails to meet the high expectations set by the overwhelmingly positive reviews out there. Technical issues, utterly boring stealth sections, poor decisions regarding gameplay and setting and bland story are all factors that spoil the nazi-killing fun. While being refreshing for the FPS genre, Wolfenstein: The New Order is a missed chance to bring the old-skool formula back to its glorydays.  1. Technical issues The choice for the Id engine is an odd decision. While it admittingly delivers some damn nice background images and gives the game an artsy feel, it has some serious downsides. One is the gi-normous file size, with a whopping 44GB. Another is the texture pop-in, that seems to be typical for some implementations of this engine. Every time you make a turn, the texturing to the side of your FOV lags slightly. Especially in tight places with a lot of objects, this can really be annoying. While not hampering gameplay, it makes the game look kind of cheap. Another problem that spawns from this are the long loading times. Okay, back in the days we spend long times looking at loading screens. In this day and age, it kind of feels awkward. Oh, and the textures... Up close, they are simply a disaster. Black objects are smeared with the green ugliness typical for low-res texturing, and overall the objects look damn terrible.  2. Setting and storytelling First of, let me explain that I simply love the alternate history-theme. Nazis having won the war and ruling the planet, is damn terifying, and is very well played out in this game. Bits of newspaper articles lying around give a nice insight in how our favourite baddies did the trick, and the Germanic interpretations of popular 60's rock songs were down right hilarious (Die Käfer playing 'blaue U-boot'? I tip my hat to that one!).  But still, it doesn't feel right. The atmosphere is waaaaaaay too serious. The game keeps setting the focus on the hardships and the terror of the war, the powerlessness of the conquered, and so on. This would be a great angle for a realistic WWII shooter, but here it is so out of place! I mean, WTF? A dude dual-wielding auto-shotguns against giant nazi mechs, Panzerhunde, and even frickin' SPACE NAZIS! How can you possibly ask anyone to take this seriously? I get it, the makers tried to give the story and the characters some depth, and they succeed. A little bit. There's a love interest, and B. J. Blascowizc has these internal monologues giving some insight in his feelings, and he has these huge blue puppy-eyes in the cutscenes. But screw that. You can't present him as an unstoppable, primitive nazi-killing machine, and still trying to make him a real person. You just can't reconcile these things, and it's plain obvious throughout the entire game. What this game could seriously have used is some more tongue-in-cheek humor, more Tarantino-like moments (the scene in the train is an instant classic, though!), more bravado, more over-the-top character presentation. It just feels like the makers couln't reach a decision on what it actually was that they were trying to be: a B-movie style game, or an A-movie story. They tried to be both, but that simply doesn't work. The right choice would've been to be a kick-♥♥♥ B-movie. Related to this, I can tell you that the story is laughably poor after the first few hours. Some awesome antagonists are presented, but then disappear for nearly the entirety of the game! This takes away any drive to go out and kill these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. As for the rest, the story is incredibly straightforward, and features some initially interesting characters. Lack of real interaction with them, or overall lack in storytelling, renders you not giving a flying s*** about them in the end. And that end is incredibly derpy. Something with atomic bomb and stuff. Whatever. Finally, there's the setting in which the gameplay takes place. While level-design is quite good, it just lacks the right atmosphere in my opinion. The levels are often way to lighted, too familiar looking. It lacks some real evilness. Entire cities made of concrete? A Gibraltar bridge? An exposition? Meh. Not really frightening. I had hoped for more creepy settings, like in the previous titles in this franchise. Even the bloody concentration camp bades in beautiful summer light, which makes it look more like a holiday camp. Come on, the reality of these things was dreadful and horrific. At least try to portrey this dread and horror in the atmosphere and setting!  3. Gameplay Shooting Nazis in the face! Blowing their limbs clean off! What could possibly be more awesome then that? So how can gameplay even be an issue, you might ask? Let me explain. First of all, there is just not enough of it. There are long cutscenes with bad story, breaking down the pace. In actual gameplay, there are inexplicably long intervals of exactly jack s*** happening. Exploring sewers full of nothing? Empty corridors? A moon walk in near-zero G WITHOUT Nazis to shoot? What the hell? Not my bloody idea of fun. This title is portrayed as a game that is purely about killing nazis, but it fails to deliver on exactly this aspect! The sections in which you do get to f*** s*** up are nice, though. Gunplay feels solid, and it's awesome to completely wreck a place. But you spend the entirety of the games shooting the same exotic toys, like: a pistol! An assault rifle! A sniper rifle! A shotgun! Woopty-f***ing-doo. Boring. Ammo is scarce and enemies drop almost nothing of it. Boring. The game actively pushes you to use cover and lean to shoot. Boring. I think we all expected doing stand-up gunfights with long triggertimes, not cover-to-cover fighting, picking your shoots carefully? A shame that MachineGames decided to use the modern appraoch to the FPS genre, instead of using the perks of the old-school titles. Nope, the old-school aspect seems to be largely restricted to health-kits, armor pickups, and boss-fights. A pitty.  The biggest anoyance for last. The stealth mechanics. Okay, great to give your players a bit of freedom in playstyle, but this? The game requires you to a) be stealthy or b) face impossible odds with hardly any ammo to come out alive. So there goes your freedom. Or it just forces this style on you. I like stealth-gameplay a lot, but here it is tottaly out of place, and terribly implemented. Stealth means just following the obvious paths through -guess what!- airvents. However, you can simply walk over to your enemy crouched. He will never hear you, he is always placed neatly with his back to you, and is incredibly stupid. 'Hmmm, somebody lurking over there? Let's totally not check that out'. 'Hmmm, I think there's a guy over there pointing a gun right at my face, but he's crouched, so I can't see him!'. Yes, the crouch button is simply a 'now you see me, now you don't' button. Sticking to the shadows? No need. Walking slowly? No need. No need whatsoever to have any skill at this. And the amount of these stealth-sections are enormous. So we have and 'stealth' sections, and long cutscenes, and parts with nothin happening? Turns three quarters of this game into a massive snoozefest, for no reason whatsoever.  4. conclusion Yes, shooting nazis robots and evil technology IS fun. But this fun is limitted dramatically by the heavy amount of flaws that this game has. I am glad that people are willing to return the old-school genre to its former glory, but never mind what all the reviewers out there said, this Wolfenstein installment fails to do so properly. It is my sincerest hope, however, that the MachineGames will have a second try, because this franchise deserves its place in gaming history AND future! But the current effort is simply lacking.  If you want a good modern old-school game, buy Shadow Warrior.",

I would be singing the same tune as most of these people, but the latter third of the game is nothing but a disappointment.   The developers definitely tried to instill a bit of personality into BJ, our protagonist. He's no longer the hunk of nothingness from the prior games. BJ is now a thoughtful human being. Not a critical moment passes without an internal monologue delivered by him. These moments are a nice touch. His supporting cast is also decent. Some of the characters are quite intriguing. Unfortunately, not much is done with most of these characters. While some are quickly killed before you get a chance to know them, others are cast aside and left with little to do towards the end of the game. Even the main antagonist was given this treatment. He's only seen in the first and last level.   Although the attempts to instill some humanity into the narrative is admirable, it's also heavy-handed at times. Too often is the player reminded of the protatgonist's predicaments. We understand that BJ is a man with a conscience, but he does not have to be in agnony throughout the entire game. The presence of a forced romantic subplot doesn't help. Their motivation for engaging in said romance is never explored. It just happens after a large body-count. Wolfenstein's story is one that's yearning for some subtlety. There's potential, but it's not quite there.   The level design is possibly the saving grace of this game. There's a fair balance of stealth and combat in the earlier levels, where the stealth routes felt natural, and stealth sections were even spaced between combat scenarios. However, the levels denegerate into sheer chaos in later levels. This would fine, but as the game advanced, the environments also became more bland. While earlier levels were located in interesting locations, like an asylum and a concentration camp, later levels predominately took place in the interiors of generic military structures. Additionally, the officers that you must eliminate to prevent the arrival of reinforcements don't have much of a presence in said later levels, taking away a layer of depth that the game desperately needs.   Wolfenstein is a game that I really wanted to like. The developers definitely tried to reinvent the franchise with a more human and personable story, but between the ham-fisted dialogue and the amount of missed potential, I can't recommend Wolfenstein. It would be a fine game to pick up when it's on sale, but not for full price.",

I dunno if it's a function of our entertainment being produced within the umbrella of Corporate America, but this game has all the hallmarks of it.  First, the length of the game is pitiful. It's like the maps were designed to entertain the supposed ADHD addled minds of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ 4yr olds. While that is so obviously not the case, the maps are pitifully short. If I were to play this game on the easiest level of difficulty it would likely take me about 3 to 5 hours to complete (and thats only because of the manditory cut-screens). It's shameful that this game was released without any real depth.  Secondly, and this should follow, this game has absolutely no depth what-so-ever. There are parts of this game that are embaressing to witness. What do I mean by embaressing? Well, you know how it's kind of embaressing to witness a strangers emotional outburst? Like if some guy and girl are all arguing in the parking lot of a restaurant, all crying, emotionally panting, and you have to walk by them? That's because they are strangers. You have no idea whats going on or what their motivations are or if you should say or do something. It's embaressing because you have no relationship with them what-so-ever. Guess what: the characters in this game are total strangers and the lack of any development therein makes witnessing their stories simply embarrassing... uninteresting... pitiful... horrible... etcetera. But there is a way to fix this of course: make the ♥♥♥♥ing game longer so that all the characters (that you are supposed to care about) are involved with you in some way. Hell, even the obligatory sex scenes are more embarrasing than sexy.  Third off: it's a pretty game. I bought a new PC to manage the pressure of this thing at the highest levels of complexity and I was not let down in that regard. The environments are interesting, the special effects are bloomtastic, and the modelling is (at the very least) exquisite.  Finally, there is no multiplayer game play. Let me sat that again: FINALLY AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THIS ♥♥♥♥ VARIENT OF RETURN TO CASTLE WOLFENSTEIN, ONE OF THE MOST GROUNDBREAKING MULTIPLAYER GAMES SINCE MULTIPLAYER GAMES WERE INVENTED, HAS NO MULTIPLAYER GAME PLAY. I can't think of anything more condemning than that. I mean seriously... what the ♥♥♥♥?  All told not even the prettiest flower is worth the cost of this game. It's mildly entertaining, but it's short and far to easy even at the hardest difficulty level. Buy it when it's far cheaper that a Denny's breakfast plate... at least breakfast at Denny's is a bit more entertaining.",

They legitimately walk up to you with their gun out and might shoot after 10 seconds, so you have time to kill them! They basically always look like they're surrendering.  There's also a huge blast to the past with all of the powerups. Every nazi you gun down gives you a hat as a reward. You can wear an infinite number of hats at a time. They give you armor.

Good game terrible length and the graphics could definely be upped a bit.   If you want a Gorey game and that looks past-gen along with incredibly detailed characters and a short story. This is the game for you, but if you are looking for a game with length and longetivity and replayability this is not a game for you. I would wait till the price drops if you are wanting to buy this game, it is good.. but not 60$ Good or anywhere close especially with the aspect that they only built a single-player platform that is rather pathetic to only have a certain length of gameplay hours I would expect atleast 50-70 hours of gameplay.

            "review_text": "I am honestly completely flabbergasted as to how this could be reviewed so positively. The storage requirements are ENORMOUS (a whopping 40+ GB), yet the optimization is garbage and the advanced customization options are junk; you can't even turn off the absurdly-overactive depth of field crap via in-menus, only turn it DOWN. The story is a thoroughly-bland waste of effort and time, and the game frequently has you doing inane, boring garbage like looking around a safehouse to find a stupid folder so you can get to the rest of the game.  As for the gameplay itself, well, it's HORRIBLY antiquated and plain. Enemy variety is poor, consisting of a very small handful of units you see repeatedly with different skins. The weapons selection is very meager (pistol, automatic rifle, shotgun, sniper rifle, and a cutting tool), and the weapons themselves very unsatisfying; enjoy unloading entire magazines into the heads of some 'armored' (even though they're wearing the same helmet as anyone else) enemies while they simply stand there and shoot you to pieces, never mind the 30-40 bullets slamming into their faces. Enemies are consistently damage sinks, so you spend most of the game firing far too much to kill many of the enemies; I actually thought I was playing a couple of 'boss' fights the wrong way, when it turns out there was no strategy at all involved other than 'shoot a lot more than is at all fun'. The 'overcharge' mechanic is worthless; extra health fades so rapidly as to last literally SECONDS, so the mechanic is completely pointless unless you spend most of your time standing on health packs. And you know when games make the INCREDIBLY crappy decision to take away all of your weapons and ammo? Happens. All. The. Freaking. Time. So you spend the majority of the game trying to get back all of the weaponry you've already acquired several times, often with absolutely no explanation as to why you are now mostly unarmed. The environmental destruction is also very minimal, with the most 'impressive' examples being a few short concrete hallways. The stealth gameplay is quite decent for an FPS, but the biggest motivation for using it is so you don't have to chew your way through more toe-to-toe combat; trying to avoid crappy gameplay by using mediocre gameplay isn't very fun, especially when you WANT to be shooting up a bunch of Nazis. The story is so bland and uninteresting that I've basically been just avoiding it completely for the last several hours. War is bad, Nazis are bad, killing is bad, yada yada yada. Boring. I honestly can't name a single character, and couldn't care less who lives or dies; I cannot fathom who thought it would be a good idea to shackle a Wolfenstein game to some 'deep' story about loss and war, but they were wrong and failed at the execution. Even the 'climactic' final boss fight is AMAZINGLY uncreative and tedious; it ends up being nothing more than a race to dump damage into the boss before it kills you, because you get stuck in a room with hellishly-bad cover. You end up spending the whole fighting running from health pack to health pack, with zero complexity or style to the fight other than 'shoot a thousand more bullets'.  Basically, the game is a massive grind. They even managed to make killing Nazis on the Moon incredibly tedious! You get shackled to battery-powered weapons, so if you aren't picking up batteries from EVERY enemy you kill (which is rather problematic since you want enemies to be dead far away from you, BEFORE they get close enough for you to grab batteries off them), you end up constantly having to charge off of wall outlets. Yes. Wall outlets. To charge guns. In the middle of combat. So you can shoot Nazis on the Moon.  Honestly, I forced myself to complete this game just so I could delete this bloated waste of time from my hard drive. Even at the $15 I got it for, this is one seriously tedious and uninteresting game. The music is probably the best part, but I would've been much better off just buying the music than playing this game. I would rather just play the original Wolfenstein than this game, because at least that one has the excuse of being more than 20 years old as a reason for being overly simplistic and repetitive.",

All its annoyances aggregate into a less than stellar experience.   What's the good? Gunplay is solid. Players can dual wield nearly every weapon. This is handy at higher difficulties since even the weakest enemies take a dozen rounds to drop. Also, guns have alternate fire modes. Although players will have access to all weapons early on, most of the alt modes are not unlocked until later in the game. This breaks up the monotony and balances the game a bit.   The campaign lasts about 15 hours. For a $60 title with no multiplayer, that's the minimum I'd expect. The environments are varied and allow for slight amounts of exploration. So levels feel bigger than what they are. Players can employ different tactics to dispatch enemies. Stealth can be more effective than run and gun at times. And sometimes camping behind a box and popping baddies one by one is most effective. No style dominates the game. At the hardest difficulties, run and gun is least effective. However, after a single playthrough I noticed stealth is broken. Patrols will walk over dead bodies and not sound the alarm. They will only sound the alarm if they see the player or see him kill someone. So there is no need to drop baddies out of sight. Not very challenging.   What's the bad? The game is buggy. During cutscenes, audio and mouth movements don't sync (think Skyrim) breaking the emersion. Turning off Vsync sometimes helps, but then there is horrible screen tearing to deal with. Also, the game randomly freezes briefly at set intervals during the first few missions. The freezing magically stopped after progressing further. Using a controller presents other problems due to inconsistent button behavior. I select alt fire mode, and the map opens. I open the radial and select a weapon, my character briefly freezes while taking damage before the next weapon is available. Under normal circumstances that's annoying. While playing the hardest difficulty it's downright rage inducing.   The graphics are OK but not a great showcase for the id tech 5 engine. Wolfenstein is plagued with inconsistent textures, pop ins, and jagged edges. Lighting effects drastically change by moving an inch. And there are limited advanced graphic options. There is no AA control. The frame rate is locked at 60fps. Currently, SLI and Crossfire performance stinks. Forcing features thru CCC did not help. Another negative: Wolfenstein is a 50gb install. Plus, a huge patch has to be downloaded. Since the graphics and sound are merely OK, the size is just excessive. Here's a bit of irony: TNO looks like it was made using the Unreal Engine with its almost cartoony/almost cel shaded environments and weapons. Artistically, it looks like any recent Unreal-based games. Was this intentional?   I hate TNO's erratic pacing. Between missions, the player hangs out at a base. And the 'errands' between missions slow the game to a crawl. Forget about annihilating Nazis around the clock, because the resistance wants you to stop and find mold samples. Kill a few more Nazis and you're stopped again to find a blowtorch. The base and accompanying side missions mimic Dishonored. But this is Wolfenstein....  Lastly, I don't like the story. TNO tries too hard. It felt forced. It felt déjà vu. And the ending was just plain lazy. The aforementioned base exists solely to advance the story, but kills the action as a result. Heck, audio logs appear just for progressing through the game. No need to find em. And TNO holds players' hands thru everything. Someone is always on the radio detailing each step. And when 'map updated' appears on screen, 'secret' items are revealed on the map with a question mark. Too easy. Too pandering.   Sigh. Overall, TNO feels like a tacky homage. I'm annoyed that one of the final battles was ripped directly from Quake 4. Plus, TNO lacks the brutal combat and creativity of the games that made id synonymous with the fps genre. The new developers tried unsuccessfully to create an emotional backdrop instead of focusing on Wolfenstein's most important trait: Gunplay carnage. I'm all for a good story, but TNO's story was so violent, so gory, and just so over the top that I stopped buying into it. How much damage can the main character withstand? There's a difference between badassdom and just plain ridiculous. By the game's end, I didn't have that, 'Oh yeah, come get you some' feeling like I did in Max Payne 3. Instead, I was glad it was over.   Wolfenstein TNO is an OK fps. Unfortunately, TNO assimilates elements from other popular games without creating its own identity. This is not the nonstop ride gamers expect. Even worse, it's a console port that needed months of polish before its PC launch. TNO still has performance issues weeks after launch. Asking 49,99€ for buggy title with no multiplayer is a tall order. Wait for this game to go on sale.",

            "review_text": "This game sucks. If you bought it hoping for an action-packed classic-Wolfenstein experience, prepare for disapointment. Even the opening cutscene sucked, because it was at about ten FPS. On a brand new card. Bethesda seems to like cutting backroom deals with Nvidia, because my brand-new AMD card, which can run Fallout 4 max-settings at 60 FPS, can barely handle this game. It's the same thing that happened with RAGE. It was made so it couldn't run on AMD systems, and it happened again here, and then again with Watch_Dogs. The gameplay isn't even all that great either.  It's not that it's bad, just stupid. You have enemies who can barely see you in stealth from about ten feet away, while those same enemies have superhuman reflexes and sight as soon as you break stealth. It's like they couldn't decide whether to make a stealth game or a classic shooter, and they wound up with the worst of each. The first rifle you get can fire semi-automatically and kicks ♥♥♥, while all the 60s era weapons are all-auto-all-the-time, with absolutely no justification whatsoever. Even the pistol is burst fire, but attaching a supressor turns it back. What. Why can't I use that without the supressor?  You keep no gear between levels, again with no justification. You can't even keep your ammo. Good luck playing this game like a real shooter. It's a stealth game advertised as a shooter. Duel-wielding? Forget it, useless. And because of the atrocious performance, forget aiming. In a game with no true semi-auto guns and no way to get rid of the lag, you need something like that.  On top of all that, the controls suck too. Sure, you can remap some of them, but that just makes your control scheme even more inconsistant. The mouse sensitivity is even worse, since your FPS seems to affect that more than usual. The aiming is choppy and inelegant. Sprint-sliding returns you to a standing position, which sucks when you use it to get into cover. The sound design only compounds these issues, as everything but speech sounds distant and washed-out. You can't detect enemies by sound, so you have no way of knowing if you are being flanked  In short, don't even bother unless you've exhausted every other shooter in the universe, because any of them, even Far Cry 4, make more sense than this. And if anyone just says 'Git Gud' I am. I play Uber, and it isn't very hard until the game throws a bunch of fake-difficulty at you. If anything, that's another reason not to get it. Not even the hardest difficulty is all that hard, just frustrating. Get Doom 2016 instead. It's actually fun.",

The game suffers from something of a lack of depth of combat after the initial fun of the gunplay wears off. The stealth sections are medicore and just turn into a silenced pistol turkey shoot as brain dead AI can't spot you and completely fail to notice their fallen comrades. The game falls into sending wave and wave of cheap damage sponge enemeies at you. I found myself turning down the difficult just because these enemies aren't much fun to fight. The just hit like brick shithouses and absorb a ton of damage. And this is a real drag as the combat wears thin far before you're done the game.

            "review_text": "Dont buy it! Has many technical flaws (detailed description bellow, but expect typical lazy console port problems including fov) Very generic and mediocre game, not very different from Call of Duty, in some terms it even worse. so i dont get all the positive reviews for this game from people who gives negatives to COD, both are not so good. This only only has interesting setting and ard direction. Gameplay is primitive as hell - shoot things, sometime sneak, fail to play it stealy and get bet to shooting things. MachineWOrks when they was part of SBZ did much better games like Riddick and Darkness.  Now technical flaws: FOV - this game is yet another illustration of devs not taking FOV problem seriosly and doing lazy job for pc version while game is purely designed for consoles with narrow fov.  So default fov is 80 (hor), arms and weapons designed with idea that nothing besides this fov would be seen, so fov slider in game does not affect weapons and hands fov and cutscene fov, and games does ugly and annoying jumps between gameplay fov and cutscene fov like if your character has camera zoom in his eyes. Cutscene fov cant be fixed with cvars, so annoying transition would always happen. Weapon fov can be fixed but not very good, since game assets designed aroun 80 devs gave not care about hans and weapons properly dislaying in higher fovs, so they are - many weapons has non correct shoulds in front of you with proper fov, so you are limited by safe range which goes up to 1.2 and its not very differnt from defaul  I feel headache because of sickness these fov problems causing and cant play more than 30 minutes per session.  Cutscenes - a real diasspoitment! Most of them, even smallest ones like conversation with some friendly NPC - ARE PRERNDERED, and not just prerendered, its prerendered in ultra wide resolution wiht 21:9 aspect ratio for it turns half of your screen into black bars, Watching aspect ratio jumps from 16:9 to 21:9 is painful and annoying, like watching 16:9 movie with fan mantage of deleted scenes mixed in with 4:3 aspect. Feels very inconsistent! Plust video resolution not so great if you play in 4k, it just 1920x816. Videos prerendereded without maximum AA and have notticable jaggies, plust video gamma does not match gameplay gamma and looks washed out. And if you will turn off ugly color grading and noise in game, color tone will totally missmatch.  I really dont get reason of this stupid decision, previos Wolf games had almost 100% real time scalable cutscenes that looked better, riddick and darkness cutscenes looked better as well. Folders with most of videos called loading screens, so they supposed to hide loading and smooth transition bettween levels, but for some reason i still can see loading screen after and before videos and other cases, and montage is not smooth at all, most of time i feel like some scene between levels are missing and cant get how one tuned into another, plus they waste 5 gb on HDD on nothing. They should have done these scenes in real time without black bars.  Gameplay - well its just plain and stupid just like COD, go there and shoot, levels are totally linear, invisible walls everywhere, doors getting perma closed behind you in such a ugly fashion (like in very 1st level on plane you go from cockpit to cargo bay and door behind you getting perma locked until you finish task and can return to cockpit), stealth absolutely dumbed down (comparing to riddick that did it right, and even comparing to prev Wolf game), and skill tree serve no purpose except for prolonging gameplay with artificial limitation. Game absolutely have no imagination involved in gameplay and feels primitive and lacking comparing to previos Wolf game that had sort of open world with back tracking, had a lot of useful paranormal skills that sometimes was involved into environmental puzzles (like in half life 2) that was nice addition to shooting, which also felt different with different skills, plus there was non linear and quite wider levels, and a lot of usefull secrets to find, not like in this game where collectables just cosmetic, in previous one they added to progress and allowed to unlock upgrades and skills so you had reason to search for them all to upgrade everything to maximum. AI was also way better in prev Wolf game. New order feels totally dissapointing and wors than previous one. I wish i could buy older one on steam instead of new order, but unfortunally its unavailable for some reason (most likely distribution rights stucked in copyright hell during transition of ID between Activision and Bethesda), older Wolf had better SP mode plus it have very good MP, and new order totally lacking that.  And previous Wolf was not such a perfect game, it was more or less like 8 of 10, comparing to it New order feels like 5 of 10.  Oh and about presentation - previous SBZ games like riddick and darkness had absolutely realistic, innovative and ahead of time presentation of body awareness (aka legs and rest of body), which was done very very wel. While in cutscenes legs are present in Wolf TNO there is absolutely no body awareness in gameplay, and hands with arms done pretty lazzy and old school way, they dont even have laged movement behind camera (like one you can see in HL2), no pick animations (like one you can see in Crysis) no interraction animations (like one you can see in Duke Nukem Forever when he pressing buttons), no nothing (like you can see in Outlast, where even bumping into walls and corners have procedural animation of hands and body), not even weapon holster when you bumping into wall, you just have old plain floating hans with weapons done pretty lazy way.  Gameplay is boring, repetive, lacking innovations and progress of most modern game, yet it lacks maze levels and other things from old games, so it stuck in a middle of old and modern shooters, taking worst thing from both.  Damn, any Call of Duty (which i dont like for many years and consider COD 4 a highest point of series), even most recent feels much better and offer much more than this game. Im just glad i purchased it for about 3$ during sales, and did not waste full price on it. Definetly not going to buy prequel to this.",

It was advertised as an old-school run-and-gun game much like Painkiller or Doom, but it's actually closer to playing like Half-Life 1 and 2. You progress through linear levels that you can either take stealthily or Rambo-style. The graphics look nice, although the colors seem a bit muted and there is no option for anti-aliasing. The game is fairly well optimized and runs at a pretty smooth frame rate even on low end machines.  The storyline plays out like a mix between Inglourious Basterds and Iron Sky. In this universe, the Nazis won World War II and have taken over the world. You play as BJ Blaskowicz as he wakes up from a coma in 1960 and joins the resistance. There are newspaper clippings all over the game detailing the history of this alternate world, and you get a few Easter eggs like a record by 'Die Kaefer,' titled 'Das Blue U-Boot.'   This isn't an easy game by any means. I died a fair amount on medium difficulty. The game uses a hybrid of old-school health packs and modern regenerating health. Armor does not regenerate but health will regenerate to the nearest multiple of 10 (if you get shot so your health is 75, it will regenerate to 80 but not more) and you can overcharge health for those reckless guns-blazing sections where you know you are going to take more damage than normal, but the overcharge will eventually level out to your maximum health. This means there are equal amounts of balls-to-the wall corridor shooting sections and large open stop-and-pop arenas. It feels like a merger of both 90's and 2010's FPS design philosophy. You are encouraged to search the whole level to find secrets, like gold, enigma codes, and health upgrades.   This is a story-based single-player game, so there is no multiplayer. There are currently no expansions or DLC's. What you pay for is the full, complete finished game. It feels like a breather from a market saturated with $60 games that only feel about 60% complete without DLC.

The graphics are great and the framerate runs smoothyl (for my PC at least), the level design is fantastic with fresh new areas almost each chapter, starting with a D-Day-esque invasion of General Deathshead's fortress, then going to far as a submarine and onto the moon. The gunplay is excellent, with the ability to dual wield almost every weapon except for the Laser Kraftwerk (my favourite weapon in the game) and any turrets you can carry around. The gameplay is solid as well, with four different 'perk trees' to upgrade by completing challenges. Each tree is different, ranging from stealth gameplay to demolitions for those who like to run and gun. The bosses were fairly fun, although certain bosses was disappointingly easier than I expected. Overal the game is a great new installment to the Wolfenstein franchise and is perfect for those who want more old-school shooters and for those (like myself) who love the idea of alternate history and history all together.

Some people will complain that there are some fetch quests here and there, but I do not believe this game was made purely to blow stuff up. The story and atmosphere of the game is excellent. I became really attached to the characters and was happy to see that the main character had some dimensonality to him.  Within the first level, you are faced with a choice and I was suprised at how hard it was. In the short time I had been playing the game, I was already connecting with the surrounding characters. If you are looking for a shooter with a good solid story, this is a must have. But be warned, there is no multiplayer. This is the fact that made me want to purchase the game. It is obvious that the devs spent all of their time on the single player campaign and I am glad they did. Props to the devs for making an awesome game and my current favorite FPS.  After completing the game on hard, I am still going to go back and make diffent choices and unlock other game modes since I enjoy the combat. The AI is pretty good. I have been flanked sooo many times. Sometimes I will get the bots stuck in a way for an easy win, but this was not very common since I mostly did as much stealth as possible.  Finally, the only thing I wish was included was some form of firefight mode. As much as I enjoy the story, if I am in the mood to just shoot some Nazi's, then going though a chapter with bits of story is kinda laborious. That is the only thing I would add to this game.  9/10 for me, got it on summer sale for $30 US and it was worth every penny",

The campagin takes about 16-18 hrs on a regulare playthrought, longer if you are going for all the collectibles and faster if your speedrunning it. Because of the ammount of collectibles and (SPOILER) 'the two timelines' this game has a good potential for multiple playthroughts, especially for the completionist and the achivementjunkie. The difficulty scales well with progress and chosen difficulty, with the exeption that the AI is a bit stupid and predictable on anny difficulty. One thing that is annoying, (wich you will get used to after a while) is the humongous weapon models wich takes up half the screen, especially with the abillity to dual-wield a bunch of weapons.

They could have gone the typical FPS route and created a game with little to no story, but they've managed to create a compelling story (while still fun and campy) that actually makes you care about the characters and what happens to them. To add to the fantastic story, they've also created a game that is a hell of a lot of fun to play. The game mechanics work well, the guns are fun to shoot and have a weight to them, and there's a satisfaction in seeing a Nazi get his head or other body parts blown off with a shotgun. I've already played it to completion twice and am on my third playthrough and can see myself playing through it a couple more times. When's the last time an FPS made you want to do that?   One of the best parts of the game (besides the story and combat) is the ability to play it stealthy or loud. You won't be able to stealth the entire game like you would a Splinter Cell game, but for a good amount of most levels, you can go stealthy, or go flat out loud if you so desire. One of the fun parts of going loud is that you can dual-wield almost every weapon you get. Want to dual wield pistols? Think bigger! Dual wield shotguns, submachine guns, assault rifles and have fun blowing your enemies away!  I only played a brief amount of Return to Castle Wolfenstein before playing this, and that was my only previous knowledge of the series, and I loved this game, so don't feel that you need to play the previous entries in the series before playing this game.

I played the original and the various iterations of the shooter genre since, and none of them had the heart this game does. All the characters are very well drawn and presented as powerfully and a realistically as any I have ever played. If you are a person who prefers to focus on the game solely as an exercise in trigger pulling this may not matter to you, but I was amazed at the quality of the writing and the character development. It is the best writing I’ve experienced in any game, and the main character in particular has a compelling inner dialog and a broad personl scope of the sort you’d normally find in a movie.   The game also does a wonderful job of defining the ideas and methods of the Nazis and it does it in a way that does not interfere with game play – you hear snippets of conversations for instance, and they are chilling. You truly get a sense of the stakes and the sacrifice that is needed to stop them. Again, rather than slap together another tired shooter the people behind this game made it all very personal and human, and went to great effort to produce a cast that meant something. Great heroes, great villains. There is a mountain of carnage and gunplay along the way, horror and stomach churning moments, set pieces with massive scale and excellent cinematics, and a world that is well composed and frightening. All of the voice acting is stellar.  I strongly recommend turning on all the subtitles and allowing the personal and emotional parts of the game to play out if you want to understand what this game was supposed to be – not just a shooter, but a story about people fighting to save the world. Wolfenstein is really a tribute to those in uniform and what they choose to give up to defeat evil. And you do get to kill a lot of Nazis. It is not perfect, but it definitely is one of the few games I liked so much I wrote a review.  In the end it is not a simply “shooter”. It is a game about waging war. If you let the dialog and story work you will find a lot to like. The effort was successfully made to convey an understanding of why you’re fighting and make you care about the outcome and the main character. I recommend it.",

William Blazkowicz looked the part too - I'm sick of hipster/lanky protagonists like Aiden in WD or Nathan Drake. Bring on the old school 90's meathead! This game oozed attention to detail. Every chapter seems 'fresh' with a unique visual style and setting. The gunplay is also mixed up to keep it from getting stale. Seeing the concept art after finishing the game really showed how much attention to detail MachineGames put into this - even the parody of The Beatles record in this game sounded really good. I also enjoyed the 18+ rating for this game. The gore really matched the Nazi setting and it felt like the right amount. I'm really glad this game didn't pull what 'The Expendables 3' did and PG13 the series. Some of the dislikes regarding the game is the large download size (45GB!) and the low res textures. Overall, it's a spectacular game with great visual style and set pieces that draws on your heartstrings. Great job MachineGames. 9/10!",

Even from that video alone, it's clear that Wolfenstein: The New Order isn't just some thrown together game that you're going to get bored with a forget 5 minutes after you finish. In a word, this game is all about polish. Almost every aspect of the game feels carefully crafted to make a very memorable experience.  First of all, the guns. There's not many of them, but each is fun to use. Also, as you've probably heard, almost every gun can be dual-weld. If you're looking to blaze down a hall dual-weilding auto shotguns, this is the game for you. The gunplay is incredibly satisfying as well.  Second are the characters. In a game that's about mindlessly mowing down Nazis, you wouldn't expect characters that you'll actually care about. But this game has exactly that. There's great dialog and some thought out character development that keeps you invested throughout.  Third is the music. Just the fact that I'm devoting a paragraph to the music alone should tell you how much I loved it. It'll have your head nodding when you're deep in battle, with loud, almost industrial techno. It's soft and thoughtful when the game slows down. It perfectly fits with the theme of battling through a distopia, with lots of high octane action. The soundtrack is on Spotify as well. Definitely check that out.  Lastly, I feel this game needs to be praised most for its pacing. This is an aspect of games I feel like a lot of people don't even discuss. I think this is mostly due to the fact that people expect games and levels within games to be long nowadays. This is presumably due to the notion that if something is long, you're getting more value. However when you play a well paced game like this, you realize this isn't always the case. The game is smart enough to shift between between the action, stealth, time in HQ, and cutscenes at such a fast pace, that it never feels dull for a moment. Because of this, I found myself playing for longer sessions than I normally do. Just when things are about to get dull, a giant Nazi robot will probably attack. Just when you're probably about to get burnt out from too much shooting, the game is probably just about to slow down for dialog. I really wish a lot more games tried harder to achieve good pacing, as it really makes the entire game much more enjoyable. It allows you to experience pieces of the game in enjoyable bursts, rather than dragging on to the point of boredom.  All in all, I can't really see this game disappointing any fan of shooters of action games in general. Unless over the top gore isn't your thing, absolutely play this.",

William Joseph 'B.J.' Blazkowicz, an American soldier and member of the resistance movement. I don't want to say anymore about the story for fear of spoilers, but there are some good plot twists and it has a good pace throughout the game.   The guns in this game feel like they have a lot of power. It's especially satisfying to dual wield shotguns and decimate everything in the room. You also have option of playing stealthy (at first). If you are revealed, you can't return to stealth like in some games. This isn't necessarily a bad thing though -- like I said, the guns in this game are very satisfying to shoot.   Lastly, I really like the effort that this game puts into the alternate history. Besides the Nazis winning World War II, you can find little snippets of news articles about monumental events (such as Nazi Germany being the first country to land on the moon).   Overall, Wolfenstein: The New Order is a great, action-packed game.",

I gotta go and do WHAT now?' The mental challenges of the storyline are pretty well set in place and provide good motivation to keep after the goals.   The only unfortunate issue I have is that the movies between missions don't keep up with the audio very well. I don't know how common this is, but the three options in dealing with the matter are down to, let the video drag on until it gets to where the audio ended almost a minute ago, or hit escape a couple times quickly to get it to synch to the current spot in the video, only to have the audio run off into the distance again. The third option is just to skip the movies altogether by hitting E until it picks up on the next mission. This destroys the gameplay and especially for the first few times through. After a few runs on easy it doesn't bug me as much, but it's still a bit of a letdown.  As to the movie content, it's top notch. I'm not a fan of sex scenes in video games in general due to the fact that they are rarely pertinent to the game itself. I'm marginal on whether this game needed one, but at the same time it was tastefully done, and did contribute to setting the emotional tone of what the storyline is all about, so no complaints.   the weapon selection is a bit clumsy in arrangement, but getting used to it will happen. Maybe displaying the number key each weapon is assigned to when you thumb the scroll wheel on the mouse would help make things more fluid. The weapons themselves are pretty well designed and execution is good too.   Finally, I know this game isn't new, but it has aged pretty well, all things considered. I enjoy a romp through the levels on a regular basis, and I doubt I'll be getting tired of it any time soon.  Well done ID Software, and thank you.",

I am more than impressed.  Absolutely loving the singleplayer, I'm actually keeping track of the story and relishing each new chapter.

I have enjoyed the ability to choose whether I Rambo my way through the map dual weilding assault rifles, sneak through a hidden corridor to come up behind a commander and slit his throat, or a combination of the two. The graphics are great and will really shine on Ultra settings, provided you have the GPU to support it. There have been a few instances where the automatic weapons will have a stray shell casing stuck next to the gun, but this was a minor glitch.   One neat little gameplay element that I have enjoyed so far is the way the map is unlocked. Of course as you progress through the level, you reveal the places that you have been, but say you find an emergency exit map on the wall... pick it up and you reveal the entire location. It was a subtle gameplay presentation that I really enjoyed; however, I can see this getting redundant and losing its appeal over time.   In past reviews, other players have reccommended starting on Hard difficulty for experienced FPS players and I agree. I usually start on Normal difficulty on all games just to get a feel for it before I crank it up on a second playthrough. In this case, I started on Hard and have not been disappointed. It definitely presents a challenge, but it is not overbearing so long as you take cover when necessary. The ammo and health are abundant between firefights and I'm often forced to leave bullets behind due to max ammo cap. This, of course, could be due to my playstyle.   Overall, in the crowded genre of FPS, this game does not introduce any gamechanging mechanics. The story is well written, the graphics are great, and the gameplay is solid. The lack of multiplayer may decrease the replay value, but some games just don't need it. While a co-operative campaign would have been a good addition, it would not have fit with the story, and a hastily thrown together adversarial multiplayer would have detracted from the overall experience.",

It's a linear FPS, but with multiple ways you can approach levels. You can do it the stealth way, the run and gun way, both or just your way! The story is interesting: Nazis won the war and it takes place in the 60's under the Nazi Regime. I love history, so this was interesting, and you can look deeper into the lore with little articles scattered around the game. There's lots of guns you can take and the game always had me on the edge while I was playing.

I actually felt some real emotions playing this game that I haven't felt since Bioshock Infinite. Call me a softy if you must but I feel like this game got the story right. Yes, some parts are just bad, but overal story wise the game is pretty good for a twist on a classic shooter. The gameplay is fun and excited. There are a few moments where it feels just way to repetitive but then again is it a remake a classic basic shooter. All in all I would give this game a solid 7/10. Pretty good story, fun gameplay, and great visuals. Its everything one could want in a modern shooter. It doesn't try to hard to be something it isn't yet still has enough of a story to keep someone who wants one interested, and the story isn't overdone to the point where people just out to kill Nazis will be overally annoyed with it. I 100% recommend picking this game up for fans of classic and modern shooters alike.   TL;DR verison? You kill Nazis on the moon. Buy this game.

The story is clever story that is very  very  un-call-of-duty. It had a feel to the story that isn't really classic per say but just different, something very refreshing in the age of cod, they put as much work into the game as possible, it isn't some cash grab.  Graphics wern't as awe inspiring as Crysis 3 or Battlefield 4 but they were pretty decent. I ran this game on a 4-core i5 and an AMD 7850 and I got good framrates and I was running it on the highest settings. The graphics are a lot better then Rage (which uses the same engine) and I really thought some the sceenery is excellent. And it has excellent coloring so you don't get the cod-esk gray-ish lighting in places that should be colorful. Right now a lot of games that have come out recently are colorless souless cash-grabs that flood the mainstreem, this is as far from that as possible.  Over all It is an excellent game, is it as good as or better then Half-Life 2, probably not. But it is different, so many games are just a cash-grab that is the same as the last one because they are affraid to change it to make it better. This game isn't like that, they put every ounce of work into it. They wern't trying to get it out the door as fast as possible, they wanted to make what came out as good as possible.  Some parts of the game kind of seemed out of place, such as the side quests and the unlocking system (don't worry, you barely notice anyways.) but what they did with this game was wonderful. I can only hope that Doom 4 has some of these people working on it, they know how to do quality.  If you are tired of Call of Duty, grey, some-old gameplay, story that is as boring as a lump of clay get this. This game proves that not only is iD still alive as a company but that maybe the first person shooter genre is as well.",

            "review_text": "A great old-fashioned shooter. 10/10  Beautiful environments and intelligent design make this game a breath of fresh air after a decade of shooters geared towards 'realism' rather than 'escapism'.    Gameplay   Weapons are designed to fulfill a function rather than to give variety within a class of weapon. Enemies are not bullet sponges, but use cover intelligently and flank relentlessly. The game encourages stealth rather than imposing upon the player an entire stealth section. To this end, it becomes beautifully integrated into gameplay and becomes a real aid rather than a gimmick.  However, choosing from multiple weapons in combat is clunky and could stand to go the half-life route.  Level design is vicarious and not utilitarian. They make sense. The prison looks like a prison, feels like a prison, so-on and so-forth. Any onlooker can easily tell you where you are in the scheme of things., There are multiple avenues of approach that are not readily apparent. Caches of first-aid kits, armour and ammunition are placed nicely.  Also, no regenerate back to full-health nonsense. When you're in trouble, you're in trouble.   Story   BJ encounters his arch-nemesis. A being capable of great cruelty that no one can ignore, even sub-consciously. He gets gravely inured and ends up in hospital. He awakens 14 years later from a vegatative state to defend his nurse from Nazis.  He then joins the resistance and aids them to great effect. The end-goal being revenge and justice for those lost.  While the plot is simple, the motivation has real substance. The antagonists are true totalitarian monsters and yet the supporting cast makes the player question the protaganist's character. Is he prejudiced ? Is he truly just when he kills the enemy ? Does he do his work unthinkingly ? Is he a monster for killing so viscerally and with hate ?  It leaves the player with a lot of questions, allowing him to make his own decisions as to how he views BJ. It's suprisingly mature.  It is perhaps most apt, that whatever the player takes away from this experience will depend on how invested in the plot he really is. Just following and not thinking about the game will certainly lead one to conclude that this is just another shooter. There is a story with very strong characterisaction, but only to those who take it.  It is with sad irony that I note the many straight-faced comments where people admit they don't understand the extremely simple plot and yet say the story is bad. They then go on to make excuses saying they only noticed the killing of Nazis. It's as if no one even knows enough to give a brief overview.  I have one major criticism despite the praise I have for the unflinchingly simple plot and excellent characterisation. The game resorts to heavy-handed gesturing to motivate the player at times. It likes to impose upon the player a feeling of helplessness and then quickly alleviate the situation. This confuses me. If it intends to characterise oppression, it is excellent. But if it doesn't, it's simply a machine to move the plot along.   Sound Design  The game has a great soundtrack and various perfectly-timed music cues. Weapons sound appropiately meaty and certainly change with distance and environment. Accents I cannot judge, I do not live in Europe. But I find them lovingly protrayed. NPC barks and the little conversations they have are enlightening and not at all useless.  I love how this game sounds.   Conclusion  Worth 60 dollars. Eagerly awaiting the sequel.",

I'd estimate that your play time could vary anywhere from 10 to 20 hours depending on the difficulty level and how much you explore.

The last Wolfenstein, aptly titled Wolfenstein was a run on rails shooter with almost zero storyline. All the hype and screenshots made it look great, only...it wasn't. Plus it had a tacked on multi player that made Wolf:ET fans shudder at its mention.   Now I say all that so that you know how cautious I was about going into this version of Wolfenstein, further more it's set in an alternative timeline where the Nazi regime has defeated the Allies and the whole world bows to the Reich. It's years on into the occupation of the Americas and Europe and this is where we are greeted by a familar old face. Enter BJ Blascowitz.  Now I won't say too much about the storyline and instead focus on what you get from this new title in the franchise. Machine Games have developed Wolfenstein their own way, which meant NO Multiplayer, though I'm still hopeful that Paul Wedgewood and his team at Splash Damage will revisit the franchise and re-do Wolf:ET later in the future. This single player adventure is fantastic. It's part movie and all FPS at the same time. The graphic details of the carefully crafted levels are a sight to behold, never has so much thought gone into the level design in a Wolfenstein title, it's gorgeous. The gameplay mechanics are easy to pick up and the gun play is filled with gibs galore.   This is a perfect continuation of the franchise, set apart by the timeline difference our Nazis are still Nazis and the tech is somewhat analog and plausible. I am loving the storyline and the characters that Machine Games have put together, the storytelling allows events to unfold as they're meant to without the rough crooked jump cuts from a Call of Duty single player.   In closing this is a must have single player for Wolfenstein fans, it's my top pick for 2014 single player titles next to Dying Light.  ",

Though, I am basing my opinion from RTCW which I hate to say, is a better game in all aspects.   Once you've finished it, go and buy RTCW and play it through on the same difficulty and you'll be surprised.  It's definately worth a play through just for the amsuing story and some of the enemies are fun to frag.",

        {
            "review_text": " Gameplay  First and foremost, I'll start with gameplay, as that's often what's most important. As far as gameplay goes, Wolfenstein, for me, was like a blast from the past in terms of how the shooter played out, and felt between the level design, health system, and so on. Allowing overcharge of health like in the old dooms, as well as the pickups of armor, it really felt nostalgic. But then they upped it, allowing you to for example remove armor pieces/helmets from nazis/machines, and wear those. Health can come from food as with the other wolfenstein games. Level structure felt a lot like Return to Castle Wolfenstien; linear, but open enough to explore/find secrets, which was a very good thing.  The shooting itself was great, though I found the dual wielding a bit unwieldy; couldn't zoom in without switching off dual wielding, and often times you just didn't have the health/armor to really make use of it unless using some SERIOUSLY heavy weaponry. Generally I found myself preferring the single gun setup.  The stealth system was neat because it wasn't needed at all, but encouraged. You could take out enemy 'commanders' to silence reinforcement calls if you did it stealthily; doing so also makes a lot of the secrets show up on the map, allowing you to find them easier. (they appear as ? marks, so it's not exact where they are, just the general area. Easy to figure out, but not an exact give-away).  A few negative aspects were sometimes with bosses it was a lot of trial and error; it wasn't wholly clear how to beat a few of them without trying a few times, or surviving long enough to get some radio advice from npcs.  Overall the gameplay, levels, ect, was over the tops and extremely fun. I enjoyed it thoroughly, and may play-through a second time, which is rare for me. As far as realism though; don't expect it. You're practically a superhero in terms of durability and agility.   Story  Despite being such an over-the-tops shooter, the story was surprisingly 'down to earth' in terms of moral, feeling, characters, and overall just narrative. It was very, VERY good; something somewhat rare in shooters, but a very good treat. The character's had good voice acting in my opinion, and overall made me feel attached/sad/joyed/excited and so on. The plot twists, enemies, all of it fit together in a splendid package, and the story was a rare treat as far as shooters, and games in general go.   Graphics/Sound  Generally I have no problems as far as sound goes, i'm not picky. In this, it was just as good. I would of liked if the bigger guns sounded as big as they looked, but that's excusable for me.  The graphics were not completely modernized, though had a consistant look in terms of textures/theming/ect, and overall they did the job they were meant to well enough, even if they were not top of the line.  On the downside, optimization was a big downfall in this one; the requirements are far higher then most games I've seen and the graphics didn't match up to most of them, as a result I'd say the optimization could use some work.   Overall/Extra  Overall I'd say this game was worth it; it was short, ten hours when I only got about half the secrets, and one playthrough; but for me, that's like going to the movies 5 times, for the price of 3 times. So I'd say it was worth the money given the story, gameplay, and entertainment value.  If you dislike short-ish games, don't care about story, or overall just don't like shooters, this isn't gonna change much for you, but it was a nice treat as far as shooters go, and if there is a sequal I'll surely be picking it up!",

The lack of multiplayer is one of this games strongest features, so much more time and effort has been put into the 20 hour story!   For £35?

The story is actually engaging and pretty good, I wouldn't except too much because I'm really enjoying the gameplay mechanics, OH and the boss fights, thanks god someone actually remembered we like playing games not shooting simulations, they take hundreds of bullets and THAT is how you should beat up bosses not with some cinematic press the right button ♥♥♥♥ or cut scene.

            "review_text": "Not enough games center around killing Nazi Space scientists anymore, most games nowadays are unfortunately about demonising the Russians, which is just no fun.  And then comes The New Order, a fast paced, Nazi-murdering first person shoot-em-up, with a surprising amount of character in it.   The story, while not much to really write home about, does add some character to the protagonist BJ, making the relationships he forges with the other characters much more believable.  Anyway, the gameplay is the best thing about the game. As mentioned before, the game dumps you into a level with nothing but you and a ♥♥♥♥ton of Nazis between you and your objective. The levels have multiple routes, allowing you to stealth your way around if that's your thing. But sometimes, you just wanna kick the door down and wreak havoc, and the game gladly allows you to indulge in that playstyle. Each level grows in ludicracy to the point where the game takes you to the mother♥♥♥♥ing moon and back (literally), gradually building up to the final boss which will kick your ♥♥♥ many a time if you haven't played a game with an intense boss at the end for a while.  Now, no game is perfect, and The New Order certainly has it's flaws. For instance, the interludes between some missions in the Resistance HQ, while rich with lore and backstory concerning the world BJ lives in, notably slow the pace of the game and can be rather tedious after a particularly enjoyable mission. However, a semi-positive to this is, that these can be used as quitting points in the game if you don't want to lose track of what's happening in your mission.  Other than that, Wolfenstein: The New Order is one of the better FPS games of recent years and a breath of fresh air in the sea of modern warfare game that flood the market nowadays and earns a solid 9/10 from me. I sincerely hope anyone buying the game has as much fun as I did with it.  Have fun murdering those Nazis, you ♥♥♥♥ing Psycho!  -Boogles.",

When Wolfenstein came out in 2009, I thought it was a great addition to the series and bolstered an amazing openworld concept like no previous game in the series. Upon completing The New Order, I was filled with nostalgic butterflies which brought me back to the good ol' days when I used to binge play these games. I laughed, I killed, I cried at the end. I felt like nothing was missing after this. The developer who was tasked with this game did an amazing job, especially the concept / level design. My favorite thing about this game had to be how well and professionally done the audio was. Robot's would have sweet guitar riffs. Boss's would have sweet heavy metal guitar riffs. There were guitar riffs everywhere that catalyzed my anger to kill Nazi's. My only let down has been a beef of mine for the last two games. Make a multiplayer like Enemy Territory. Yes I know there is 'Dirty Bomb' but that isn't anything like Enemy Territory was. Bring that back!   10/10 I love this game.",

            "review_text": "Some of the most fun I've had playing an FPS in years. I always appeciate a game in this genre that decide to focus just on singleplayer instead of multiplayer. The story, while not treading any new ground, is servicable and the characters are likable and believable. It's an alternate 1960 in which Nazi Germany won and now has crazy future tech to keep the population under their boot. The game takes you to many fun locations all over the world that look beautify ranging from Nazi Berlin, to under the sea in a U-Boat to a Nazi moon base! There is also a large perk system that both rewards you for your play style while incentivizing you to change up the way you play to explore all the ways you can approach situations.   Luckily, the game play is even better. The classic play with few modern additions are greatly apperciated by myself. Health only partial regenerates up to the closest multiple of 20 up to 100 HP and you can pick up armor points to supplement. Being able to carry all the weapons you find without having to give up a weapon is also classic. Each weapon has a secondary fire AND can be dual wielded. You can control the secondary mode of each dual-wielded weapon seperately which allows for easy use of both modes at the same time. You do lost the ability to aim down the sights, but they remain manageable as long as you don't fire in full auto except at close range. The hell you can unleash when nessarary is a blast.  Another surprise is the relatively fun stealth system. The AI isn't exactly the smartest about reacting to all the dead Nazis you leave in your wake, but it still is fun to sneak around stabbing unsuspecting Nazis. You can throw extra knives from a distance to silent kill from a distance. Remain in stealth when a commander is present keeps extra enemies reinforcements from coming. Going in hot will cause a constant stream of angry Nazis to show up until you manage to kill all present commanders.  If you are anything like me, wishing you could play another FPS that takes insperation from the games of 15 years ago instead of being another CoD shooter, you'll love this game. Totally worth couple playthroughs.",

When it was announced as being in development, I was only mildly curious, and as the release date approached, I wasn't excited. I probably made the decision to buy it because of the DOOM beta access.   Turns out, it is a very good game, with some of the best voice acting, mocap, and storytelling I have ever seen in a game. Some of the characters express ideas that you just never see in games, and rarely in cinema. Metaphysical naturalism, determinism, and nuanced religious musings are featured as optional character dialogue, and it fleshes out the characters and concepts on offer in an effective way. The ideas on offer in this game are thought-provoking and fresh, particularly when compared to other shooters.  I didn't understand the music at first, as the main motif didn't strike me as very Wolfenstein-ish, but as the game progressed, I discovered that the motif is intertwined with other themes, and the soundtrack as a whole made sense and was emotionally effective.  Sound effects are fantastic. Played with a decent pair of studio headphones. I'm sure it'd be amazing with a legit setup.  Gameplay and game systems are solid, but I wish I didn't have to farm for perks. There ought to be better ways to gain access to perks. They could also be more interesting. Perhaps you ought to be able to specialize, and be locked into a tree, but be rewarded accordingly, instead of having access to literally everything.  Overall, very good game. Nein/10.",

            "review_text": "Pleasant surprise. The new Wolfenstein is not only something much more than I expected, but an accomplishment in and of itself. From gorgeous visuals, imaginative alternate reality, colorful characters, to a complete disregard for the modern formula of shooter, Wolfenstein: The New Order steps up and beyond the plate of the standard FPS.  Being able to dual wield everything in the game is something I haven't seen in shooters since the world has come to accept realism as the best method for escapism. The moment you pull out two shotguns and fire an endless barrage of buckshot death towards towering robot Nazi soliders is the moment Wolfenstein has wooed you with its outrageousness. But absurdity alone cannot carry a game, which brings us to where the game truly shines. Despite the complete over-the-top design and gameplay, the story plays itself out completely straight. Despite many of the characters being nothing more than walking tropes, they're delivered in such a way that makes them endearing and engaging. The hulking, barrel chested protagonist himself consistently delivers a sense of humanity and at times, vulnerability. This combined with a complete overhaul of full throttle nonstop crazy shooting-fest delivers the motivation along with the killer gameplay. All this, and it's a mere single player shooter. Wolfenstein reminds us that the norm isn't necessarily the best and only approach to games, and reminds us of a time when outrageousness was championed genuinely.  I look forward the the future of gaming with MachineGames in it. They have much to offer in a time of homogenized oversaturated game formula.",

I was playing the game, enjoying all the shooting and boning of Polish women on trains, and then I got to this one part. This one, little kill.  I was infiltrating some Nazi building, breathing in, counting to four, breathing out, counting to four, picking bullets out of my abdomen, etc. I crawled out of a duct and into the men's restroom, where I found a lone German soldier urinating into a toilet. Rather than shotting him with his pants down, I decided to stab him with his pants down. Little did I know the majesty that I would witness when I was prompetd to click the middle mouse button.  I turn him around (by the way, he's still urinating), punch him in the throat, then proceed to slam his bald, fascist head into the very toilet that his liquid waste pooled in, drowning him in a mixture of water and Nazi pee, pull him out for a mere moment so that he may gasp and see the face of B.J. Mother♥♥♥♥ing Blazkowicz, the man who swirlied him to death, then push him back in, slide a knife into the back of his skull, and courteously flush the toilet before I leave.  From this point on, I understood who I was. I was not a freedom fighter. I was not an American hero. I was not a man. I was a demi-god. I shrugged off bullets like a goliath, killed the fascist fathers of countless aryan, racist babies, and made mind-numbingly amazing love to a Polish woman. I grew tired of the enemies I had killed in droves on Earth, so I flew to the moon so that I may foil the plans of even more Nazis, but in the black void of space, where nobody can hear Nazis being vaporized, stabbed, shot, or swirlied to death.  This game gave me chest hair thicker than a wedding cake, a chin more chiseled than the works of Michaelangelo, an erection that broke through steel, and fists that cracked the necks of my foes on their own free will.

They obviously spent a lot of time developing background stories as well, because they have created an entire alternate reality where the Nazi army won the war, and they leave a lot of extras all over the game to help build the story as to how exactly they won and what has happened since then.

However, its a game with serious flaws.  What you are getting is a story-centric first person shooter that focuses on tight, visceral gunplay, at the expense of really silly sections that they use to shake things up. The final boss is a perfect example of this, as it isn't really apparent how you need to kill him.   The story is quite good until you realize it boils down to 'war sucks' and the final cutscene failed to illicit any feels at all, unlike the recent Shadow Warrior. (C'mon...Hoji's speech was awesome. Best love story ever.) The charactors are all quite good, but there isn't much chance to flesh them out due to the breakneck pace of the story.  The weapons selection irritates me, but some people (Jackal) seem to think its acceptable. I just wanted TNO to have imaginative and interesting weapons. A Gravity gun, a Flak Cannon, a BFG, a Crossbow, etc etc. It boils down to basic counter strike style assault rifles and shotguns with the addition of dual wielding. Dual Wielding assault rifles with ♥♥♥♥ing rocket launchers attached is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome, but it doesn't feel remarkably different from other shooters.  The Perk system is quite good, killing 20 enemies while crouch sliding to get say faster reload, is cool and gives me incentives to play the game in a different style than I normally would.  The graphics are ♥♥♥♥ing outstanding, but you already know this. It took me around 16 hours to beat the game, so you will get a fair amount of play time if you are searching the nooks and crannys. I have not actually beaten the game, as I found the final boss pushed my patience, and the story didn't press me forward enough to keep trying. I watched the final cutscene ala youtube and thought it was pretty silly anyway.  This is a ♥♥♥♥ing great game, just be prepared for some frustration with the design decisions.

The controls are tight, and the levels are well-designed, despite being almost completely linear (there are often choices between sneaking through vents and confronting a horde of enemies directly). If you're a glutton for punishment, you can take on the Uber difficulty, which offers a great challenge. There's a seemingly-pointless perk system that adds little more than excuses for achievements, but it doesn't get in the way of gameplay.  The story is rich and engaging, with appropriately-gruesome cutscenes and narration. It's not a revolutionary FPS by any means, but you will definitely enjoy the time you spend with it.",

I had barely seen any trailers or any information for this game before playing it, and felt strangely rewarded for it, being gradually introduced to its compelling setting. (If you are similarly oblivious, stop reading now and just go play it.)  This game succeeds at transforming player stand-in B.J. Blazkowicz into an actual character this time around, with an actual story involving other well-written characters. The character models are very detailed and well-animated, and while some of the rest of the graphics are technically not quite top-notch, the atmosphere is rich and believable. The soundtrack enhances select scenes but generally stays subtle and never bothers the player.  The gameplay is satisfyingly and gratifyingly simple; SHOOT THE NAZIS. At easier difficulties, the game is mostly a pleasant frustration-free shooting gallery, but there are enough higher difficulties to challenge even hardcore gamers. There's also a good amount of meaningful choice; story choice with distinct effects, stealth vs assault, multiple routes etc., and the developers have done a good job at making all alternatives viable and balanced.  Still reading? Just go pick it up, especially if it's on sale for 20 usd or less (like now). Those Nazis aren't going to kill themselves.",

The graphics didn't do much for me, they focused so much on the shooting portion of the game they didn't take time to make it look incredible. Considering the relative small size of the levels when comparing with open world games now, it should have looked a lot better. When you have a linear game it gives you the ability to put more time into making the levels top notch but for some reason it didn't happen.   It is also a pretty short game if you don't die much, I ended up finishing it up in roughly 8 hours and I took my time going through and trying to take in the atmosphere of each level and listened to all the recordings and read all the newsclippings. The story is solid, I still don't like the fact of being forced into bad things happening like being captured or situations arise because of choices out of your control but that is an issue with pretty much any game with a set story.   The best part of the game is being able to dual wield shotguns, rifles and pistols. Makes it pretty fun to get them both going as you are fighting waves of enemies. The ending leaves a lot to be desired, some may like it but I didn't care for it. Overall i'd give it 6.5/10, it would have gotten a lower score had I spent $20.00+ bucks on it and would go down in rating the higher the price went. I would have been very irritated if I dropped $59.99 on it.",

My Own Summary Of The Game: Wolfenstein: The New Order depicts a young male named B.J Blascowikz fighting for the U.S.A in WWII. He fights alongside his friends Fergus and Wyatt. Captain Blascowikz's wish is to stop the nazi rule. To do this he need to kill all of those 'nazi scums', and kill the leader Deathshed.  I recommend this game to anybody who loves guns blazing types of games. Oh and also someone who likes to shoot off Nazi's heads! Storyline is great, but wow, never have I experienced a game as good as this one.  Solid 9/10.",

Make no mistake about it: this is not an open world or sandbox type shooter. This is hallway to hallway, room to room, type action. Its pretty much impossible to get lost and the game makes it obvious where you are to go next. The most important thing to understand about this game is that sets out to create an action experience. If you are looking for a product with RPG qualities or a big open world this might not be your game. One more note here: This is single player ONLY. Do not come into WNO looking for multiplayer.  Now with that out of the way... WNO is, overall, a great game in its genre. It has everything a person could want in an action shooter. The controls are great. The weapons 'feel' powerful and offer variety of choices. The enemies aren't completely useless and won't just run up to you so they can die. It is certainly an action game but you can't stand in the middle of a room, unguarded, and hope to come out alive. Additionally, the Nazis come in all shapes and sizes: big Nazis, small Nazis, robot Nazis, mecha Nazis, cyborg Nazis, crazy Nazis and finally, flamboyant Nazis.  Some of the best parts: This game may be an action shooter but the story line is genuinely good. You meet a lot of different, and well developed characters. You can feel the gravity of the situation at hand. This game does an incredible job of painting an alternate reality where the Nazis have taken over the world. I can't believe I am saying this, but the story is very good. I didn't expect ANYTHING out of the story and yet I found myself following along and listening to every line.  The gunplay is fantastic. All the weapons have 'punch' to them and the variety of weapon types is a big plus in terms of gameplay. You (as the main character) can choose to attack head on, use a sniper rifle, or duel wield just about every gun for maximum damage output. MY personal favorite was duel wielding assaut rilfes. Want to clear out that room? You will have a blast doing it. The boss fights are a lot of fun as well.  Some of the negatives... As I said in the opening, this is a hallway/room shooter. A part of me knows this was a concious design choice but I would love to see a bit more variety. You have to play the game the same way, every time. You can't choose alternate pathways or tackle a fortress in more than one way. The game forces you from room to room. Being a cinematic shooter, I get that. That said, a little more variety would not have been a bad thing.  The game also feels like it should have had more dialogue choices. The main character (you) makes ONE story choice and the game plays out around that choice. Don't be mistaken here: that choice only shapes a handful of lines by the characters. It actually has next to no effect on gameplay. There is some small bonus depending on your choice but it really doesn't matter. The goal here was trying to get the customer to play through the game twice.    Overall... I think WNO is a great game for its genre. I like using letter grades, so I give it a B+. (Its my way of saying this is very good, but not perfect.) If you enjoy FPS games and want a good story, with great action, this is your game. It truly is a well crafted product. If you want something else you may be better suited with an open world or RPG shooter.",

My annoyance is the parts of the campaign where you are searching around areas looking for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ little things like toys or tools to advance the level. Annoying as ♥♥♥♥. BUT, there are little narrations that give you ♥♥♥♥ing little clues as to what to do.   You kinda get attached to the main character. He's indurable. The little ♥♥♥♥er can survive through some tough ♥♥♥♥. But I wonder what a German would think of this game. Some of it doesn't make sense, the technology and advancements. I mean, going to the freaking moon in 1960... is this the advancements that would have occured if the Nazis would have conquered the world? I guess my favorite part of the game is the sci-fi element, where you exlore a world dirven by damn Nazism. You actually are driven to hate and kill Nazis. I would hate to be a German and play this game, and I honestly want to know what a German would think of this. ♥♥♥♥ Nazis, the filth and evil they did on this world. That's the visceral response this game generates, and a response like that to a video game... this deserves a play through.  10/10 will hate Nazis even more.  Oh, and there's sublte humor.

(No spoilers)  Cons: - AI is a failure. - Too few puzzles. - Weapon menu is unfinished.",

Blaskowits is well done and likeable with a very likable demeanor. The game ran flawlessly for me at all maxed settings...including high spec adjustments via Nvidia Inspector. Not a single crash or problem, so I don't know why others have had issues...??? Nice weapon designs. Nice animations and characters. Good story too. Kinda high priced compared to much larger games like Dark Souls 2 which is HUGE and less money. But I have to say I have no complaints. It was worth it to play the game. Pretty good replay value too because there are two diferent time lines you can opt to take. Perhaps the only thing I might have desired more of in the game, was 1. A bit longer, especially perhaps the segment on the Moon, and 2., Perhaps a few more enemies, perhaps some Nazi 'creatures' / monsters...which I think would have fit right with the game.  Compared to the last game, 'return to castle Wolfenstein', it is a better game in most respects, however, I myself very much liked the 'occult' aspect, and since the Nazi's were in fact into the occult, I think it would have been pretty cool to have given some of that into this game too...???   Overall, the game is very well polished and exhibits nice design and attention to detail. The mechanical robot dogs made no sence to me though, because, it would be utterly stupid to create a robot dog whose weaponry were teeth like a dog, instead of some kind of lazer or energy weapon. The 'armored' dobermin dog, however, WAS well done and DID make sense. Advice : Play it on one of the top two difficulty settings, otherwise you won't really sweat much and thus you will not be subject to any type of immersive feeling which B.J. most certainly WOULD experience given the situations he gets into.  Final note : If your budget is tight, and, say, you can only afford to spend money on a single FPS game, I'd say it's FAR bettet than anything that's come out for a while. However, if, say, you want to get an immense amount of game for your money, wait for a sale and instead opt for Dark Souls 2...which is rediculously huge for the money. I bought both. I hope they make another one of these, the ending leaves it open for another instalment.  Also, I'd play it with keyboard and mouse. I tried playing it with my xbox controller and using a stick to control aim is utterly worthless. With a mouse you get utter precision and control.",

            "review_text": "I have never played any of the Wolfenstein games, so this review will be a first impression of the title.  I have only played it through once, I may play it a second time to see what can be different, as there appears to be choices of who to save, you can if you want to do it in stealth or full guns blazing. 'Enjoyable full guns blazing, but can regret it when you get overwelming Nazi's and machines, not really a bad thing though.'   STORY  The story is very good for an alternative history, having seen that my allies have failed to repel the Nazi's and they have won, made me feel like that some ♥♥♥ kicking is in order, save the people who live in fear of being test subjects and killed, but it is getting common with 'ONE MAN WILL FIGHT THE WHOLE ARMY/COUNTRY TO SAVE THE WORLD, AND ONLY YOU CAN DO IT' thing, but oh well, its still very much enjoyable.   GAMEPLAY  The gameplay feels very arcadey which kinds of ruins the story telling, which I have enjoyed from what I could pay atention from, you just mostly feel like shooting Nazi's and not listen to the story as much (or at all), which is a shame, the ending is good in my view, I would like to know if there is an alternative ending though.   SKILL TREE  Skills feel like that they are not needed at all, they just feel wasted, I focused mainly on stealthing the game, so that I don't have to worry about getting hoards of Nazi's after me, but as I got further into the game, stealth became very much useless and you are forced to shoot everything, even though I had unlocked nothing in dual wield or single wield, I was still able to kill those Nazi's with ease.   AI  AI, oh boy...the AI is very basic in a way, as I have had many times that Nazi's are staring right at me in stealth, and just walk past me with no sound of alarm, you can just see their face staring right at you, they do this 'is....someone,' and keeps walking, either the Nazi's have really bad eye sight or their helmet goggles have too much tint of black, another bad AI was when you do get spotted, you can hear the Nazi soldier raises his voice in supprise, but the other Nazi's don't take any notic of him, if you kill him before he finishes his line, the alarm wont be raised.   COLLECTABLES  The games collectables are easy to find once you have foudn the map in the level, which is very close by at the start, sometimes a bit later on, but the map will show you every tunnel and all the collectables to get, this does stop the fun of searching for them, but there are time that you have to find a certain item to be able to reach the next room, plus the enigma codes is something I think every fan of the Wolfenstein game would enjoy collecting, as if they solved the enigma they can unlock new modes and difficulty to the game, and I would most likely thing the very first Wolfenstein game.   VERDICT  Would I recommend this game to my friends? I would say that the fans would enjoy this game a lot, but for people who have not played the Wolfenstein games before, not as much, if they like arcadey feel to the game, then yes I would recommend this game to them.   RATING  8.5/10 + Fun Game + Lots of Action - Bad AI - Pointless Skill Tree",

I was intrigued when I found out Wolfenstein wouldn't have any multiplayer capability. Not that there is anything wrong with MP in a FPS by any means, but a couple games out there already have the forumla down to succeed in a competitive scene. Needless to say I'm highly impressed with the end product. This is easily my new game of the year thus far, and it isn't even close. There are complaints that it's a shorter game. I'd estimate that your play time could vary anywhere from 10 to 20 hours depending on the difficulty level and how much you explore. You could get it done in under 10 if you skip as much as possible but this game tells a story as much as it's about mayhem. Considering I just spent $12 to see X-Men: Days of Future Past which was 2 hours, $60 for this game seems like more than a fair price, especially if you like replay value.",

I tweaked all of the settings, rebooted, tried rolling back my drivers, rebooted, looked for fixes to this problem online (where I saw that it seems to be prevalent), but nothing would bring this game even close to playable performance. And yes, I played through far enough to get out of the cinematic areas, into the more player-controlled gameplay in case it was just some godawful optimization in those scenes. I decided to test out Steam's new return policy after about 30 minutes of trying to fix this broken game.

Initially you are with the last rebels fighting a losing war in 1964 as the Nazi's take over the Earth. Your hit in the back on the head with shrapnel and wake up 14 years later to a world owned by the Nazi's in the 60's.  They put in lot's of story elements in the game to show the player what it's like if facist Germany had won WW2 but really it's 'meh'. Fun fact is that Philip K. ♥♥♥♥ who wrote the book that became Blade Runner also wrote a book called 'The Man in the High Tower' which is the story in this game. MAAANY gameplay/idea elements were stolen from other games such as Dead Space, Half-Life 2 among others. Your character nor your love interest never age as well breaking the story somewhat. You main character will take knifes to the gut, etc in cutscenes but pulls them out and keeps going like some super Rambo. Your love interest is solely there to have sex with. TBH I thought this game was made by ID because it feels like it. Satisfying boss battle's with a frustarting ending IMO.  Gameplay is rather fun. You can go stealthy or guns blazing but it does help to switch it up. I normally play games on normal difficulty but I found the game fun with smarter AI on Hard mode.

I played on the hardest difficulty and got a lot of stuff, and I completed the game in 36 hours.  The good part is, that if I wanted to, I could go back and replay it because depending who you choose to help near the beginning of your game, will determine which of two main paths you take for the rest of the game. I chose to help Fergus, so now I can go back and help Wyatt instead and play a slightly different path. The bad news, is I have had enough of the game, so I probably won't do that. One can only take so much of a single player shooter these days.  Overall, the game is good, the artwork is excellent and I really love the way the game mixes action with movie clips. You really feel invested in some characters and the environments look really gorgeous. I should add, that I really felt something at the end of the game too, which I didn't expect from this game.

The gameplay is fast-paced and unrealistic, but the game is more engaging for it, because it never feels like it's wasting the player's time. The gameplay facilitates multiple playstyles, which is to say it allows the player to run-and-gun or take a more stealthy approach (to an extent, at least. Deus Ex this is not). The game has a decidedly simple premise (it's an alternate history where the Nazis won, so you have to take down the Nazis) so there's little dissonance between the game's narrative and its mechanics, which is refreshing. Wolfenstein doesn't really break any new ground, but it doesn't need to. It's not flawless, but it's a solid game and worth checking out if you find the game to be affordable.",

I have enjoyed the ability to choose whether I Rambo my way through the map dual weilding assault rifles, sneak through a hidden corridor to come up behind a commander and slit his throat, or a combination of the two. The graphics are great and will really shine on Ultra settings, provided you have the GPU to support it. There have been a few instances where the automatic weapons will have a stray shell casing stuck next to the gun, but this was a minor glitch.   One neat little gameplay element that I have enjoyed so far is the way the map is unlocked. Of course as you progress through the level, you reveal the places that you have been, but say you find an emergency exit map on the wall... pick it up and you reveal the entire location. It was a subtle gameplay presentation that I really enjoyed; however, I can see this getting redundant and losing its appeal over time.   In past reviews, other players have reccommended starting on Hard difficulty for experienced FPS players and I agree. I usually start on Normal difficulty on all games just to get a feel for it before I crank it up on a second playthrough. In this case, I started on Hard and have not been disappointed. It definitely presents a challenge, but it is not overbearing so long as you take cover when necessary. The ammo and health are abundant between firefights and I'm often forced to leave bullets behind due to max ammo cap. This, of course, could be due to my playstyle.   Overall, in the crowded genre of FPS, this game does not introduce any gamechanging mechanics. The story is well written, the graphics are great, and the gameplay is solid. The lack of multiplayer may decrease the replay value, but some games just don't need it. While a co-operative campaign would have been a good addition, it would not have fit with the story, and a hastily thrown together adversarial multiplayer would have detracted from the overall experience.",

There's a fair emphasis on stealth options too, although it isn't always possible, and honestly, it just isn't as fun as straight up fighting. The maps are fairly decent as well, most are linear, but manage well enough at being varied and interesting enough to not feel like your typical 'slog your way to the next setpiece' scenario.  But even with a step taken in the right direction, the other leg is still stuck in the mud that is modern cinematic games, expect the gameplay to be broken apart by scripted sequences and storytelling segments, some of which are quite lengthy. They're cool if it's your thing, but for me, more than once I've been wondering when I'll get to stop mucking about in this train/hideout/labor camp/sewer/whatever and get back to shooting nazis, the emphasis on storytelling would be more tolerable if the plot didn't become atrocious halfway through. Not to mention gameplay mechanics such as a dodgy segemented health regen system which hardly seemed necessary, as there was more than enough health and armor items placed about the maps. Secrets were an afterthought, most collectables are just tucked in a corner while actual hidden areas are very scarce. Plus, anyone else sick of canned takedown animations that designers insist be in every game these days?  All in all, it's a fun, albeit short game. Twenty hours through both timelines getting everything, but they were enjoyable hours, for the most part.  TL;DR?  Shootin's fun. Plot's dumb. Worth picking up if on sale.

GOOD Story is excellent and it will make you emotionally invested. This is very welcome counter-balance to heavy FPS action. The story will never let you forget who you're fighting against. Sometimes it gets a bit overbearing, but there is plenty of jokes and funny references to go around.  BAD I reloaded RAGE just to make sure I was remembering this engine correctly. Unfortunately I was. This game is technically one BIG mess. It doesn't support anti-aliasing or anisotropic filtering. If you enable it in the console, your FPS will go into crawl. It is worth noting that RAGE supported all these essential PC features fine back in 2011.  UGLY Texture memory management is a joke and even with any of the latest graphics cards the game will look like it's from 2011 all over again. The ugly part is that even RAGE looked better back in 2011. Now in 2014, the same engine is used, but in far worse way than in 2011. That is utterly inexcusable. For example, none of the shortcomings of the original RAGE implementation were addressed, such as texture pop-in. If you're a PC owner, you will be disappointed as this game's graphics appears to be dumbed down due to the current 'next gen' consoles.    CONCLUSION Despite brilliant story line, believable acting and satisfying gaming action, it's the technical execution which ultimately brings it down on PC. You may have heard an advice from other reviewers to wait in order to get this game from 'bargain bin' and I concur.",

They started to lose their appeal well over 5+ years ago and they all had the exact same thing going for them save a few titles. I put down the genre for about 5 years now and I'm glad I looked into this one. The trailers had me hooked and I usually don't pay full price for a game and usually wait until it's on sale, but I had to try this one out as it looked to have way more depth than any of them I've played so far. Of course I'd be happy paying less than $60 for a game, but for me at least, this game was worth the money. I've gone through the story once so far and I plan on going back trough it again to see what I've missed. The game's timing felt well pacedand ended with enough play time in between.

The AI is very well put together and at times it feels like a real challenge to get through. I will caveat that I played this on the difficult mode, not Uber, which will be my next run through. There were plenty of frustrating moments that felt like it was impossible, but once I finally made it past the almost hopeless challenge of getting bombarded with heavy armament, I felt victorius. Wolfenstein never had much going for it when it came to story, and that's completely the truth for its first few iterations, however this time around I felt involved, intruigued and wanted to know all I could about the hero and his companions. I would definitely recommend this title to anyone who even just likes FPS's as this one feels fresh, keeps you hooked with its story and definitely pays off in the end when you get to murder every last one of the Nazi scum. I commend every developer, storywriter, artist, director and producer that provided such a fantastic piece of art. Job well done to all!",

Many fight will let you choose how to get into it and still gives leeway for enough strategy to keep it interesting.  To top it off, an interesting and engaging story. Overall an awesome game worth picking up, this goes beyond your average 'CoD shooter' and was the first game since borderlands 2 that kept me playing it almost literally nonstop.

BEFORE!) -game strips your meticulously collected gear at the beginning of each chapter. (When Metroid Prime did it once 13 years ago, it was clever because it actually tied into the story; this is ridiculous.) -worthless jump -story manages to be both juvenile and self-indulgent (I don't mind silly, over-the-top nonsense, but when it turns didactic, one can't forgive how the clumsy writing butchers classic archetypes, Hendrix, politics...) -the ending is a turd in the punch bowl.

Obviously with the Nazi setting, it would have been inappropriate to make it a fun romp, but I came away from the game quite disheartened by it. Technically it's very good. Realistic graphics and great action set pieces, but the game world is just too grey. I suppose it makes a change from the 'realistic is brown' trope, but no matter where you are, everything is grey. They even try to justify it in the storyline in a subplot about concrete that never really goes anywhere. The action is good, but tends to swing from either annoyingly easy to frustratingly difficult several times through each level. You either have an abundance of health, armour and ammo, or you have to scratch your way through. Very rarely is there any middle ground, so you'll either stick with one gun throughout the game, or just throw everything you have at the baddies. There doesn't really seem to be a lot of point in some of the weapons, especially the shotgun. The biggest criticism I have about the game though is that it is just too miserable and frankly the ending sucks. When I finished the game, I felt no real sense of accomplishment. The final boss battle relies too much on good luck rather than skill to make you feel like you've really 'won' and the payoff to the storyline is a despressing as anything else. There is a plucky Scottish ally who adds some comic relief, but it's few and far between. Halfway through the game he has a breakdown, so you even lose that. There are two branches to the game which change the storyline slightly depending on which choice you make in an early level, but to be frank I don't really feel like I want to even bother with the second path. It just seems like a chore. And forget about trying on a harder difficulty, I can't imagine that'll be much fun at all; just frustrating. Ultimately a good game that needed some lighter moments, a better ending and a bit more colour.  Pros: Good storyline Realistic graphics and effects Fun gunplay  Cons: Too damn miserable I hope you like grey Weirdly balanced gameplay",

            "review_text": "AW-some!!! Just finished my first play through and enjoyed nearly every second.  First this is a huge install 50 GB and is built on the ID 5 engine used for the game RAGE.  So the visuals are fantastic.  The game starts during WWII and you are in a squad tasked to kill a Nazi codenamed DEATHSHEAD. He is a true evil genius. He is making cybernetic Nazi super soldiers and winning the war revolves around stopping him. You and your team are shot down durring your bombing run and must make the raid on foot.  Characters are developed as you go and the two that stands out are a duo that act more like father and son than veteran and grunt.   Quickly things go from bad to worse and soon you are captured. The villian enters and forces you to make a choice between the two I just mentioned, the one you choose will die a most gruesome death- while the other is left with you- locked in a cell- that soon will be and oven- to die.  This makes two character 'time lines' depending on who you choose- the story may develope in very diffrent ways...  As you escape you are caught in an explosion and catch a chunk of shrapnel in the head... (thats gotta suck) Cut scene- credits- Game truely begins.  You wake 15 years later in a family run mental hospital.... (' I don't know... It has always been my dream to open a nice little country psych ward were the troubled people of my country can come to get help, and terrorize my children.') - IDK  Anyway, the daughter has taken care of you and grown fond of you as you watch time pass in voice- overed cut scenes. You learn that the hospital is where the Nazis come to get test subjects and when they shut it down one day all Hell breaks loose and you are given control once again.  One of the coolest things are knife takedowns. You have to sneak up behind a Nazi and hit the 'takedown' key. (Some very brutal kills) One you actually slash the legs of the Nazi causing him to fall backward where you then perforate him chest several times. You get a gut reaction of 'ouch'  Some of the K-9 unit kills are viceral too.  The whole world has fallen under Nazi rule and is now the new norm. It now is your job to undo it. The game awards you with new guns now and then giving you the means to 'upgrade' them. Usually with a scope or a new ammo type. The gun mechanics are very standard and even with the ability to duel wield- I hardly ever did. Only a couple times did I even HAVE to. I played on normal difficulty. The story was simple and to the point with very little attempts to deepen the plot or character development.  This may be my lack of finding the right cues or skipping them because of choices I had made. Make sure you achieve all the goals in whatever chapter you are in once the plot moves along all side missions and hidden objects dissappear.  You can find hidden things throughout the game: glod objects, enigma codes, letters, newpaper clippings etc... that help to 'fleshout' the world but not much. You can decipher the codes to get unlocks but I haven't tryed yet so I haven't a clue on what they are about.  Like I said I enjoyed this game. Worth 60 bucks to me and that is saying something.  I will play through again choosing the other timeline so see if it differs. -GrAnD  **********************************************UPDATE********************************************************  Just finnished the second play through choosing the other timeline. The only real change I saw was a secondary character swap, one being a mentally broken woman that goes out in a blaze of glory and the other a man who may have been Jimmy Hendrix..... Still a fun game both times but I would have combined the two story lines and added content. I did notice this time they left the end open for more gameplay....  I hope they do!! -GrAnD",

It's like nothing I've seen in a videogame before, and it could rival the most well written of movies. This is how you do 'cinematic' games right, without compromising any of the gameplay for it.  The gameplay's good, too, with really solid shooter mechanics and a pretty decent selection of weapons (really helps that you can dual wield almost any weapon, including shotguns and, yes, sniper rifles). My only gripe is that the later levels stop being conducive to stealth (which is viable in most of the game otherwise) and it starts to introduce a lot of frustrating bulletspongy enemies right before the end.

The 1940s is only an intro and the game starts off really in 1960s, when Germany has won and the allies have surendered. You're on a mission to kill Totenkopf, one of most prominent nazi in the world taken over by Nazi Germany. The atmosphere is dark, everything is taken over by Nazis, their propaganda is everywhere, and everyone whose not into tyranny is either opressed or killed.  I am truly amazed by the work they put in the voice acting. I'm a Pole and I truly hear Polish language with no false accent. I'm almost sure the German language is also spectacular and soldiers are not spewing off the false 'gibbery' German which I saw in many US productions such as Saving Private Ryan or Die Hard. Hats off, professionals were hired.  Also the notes and newspapers are in their native language, I can say the Polish ones are good. They add much to the game, as you learn about other parts of the world, what happened with USA, UK and so on. I like this kind of stuff. The weapons are great. They don't feel stiff or artificial. My one concern is only the pseudo Thompson that we get in the intro. Its fire rate surpasses all the weapons, even the modern ones. The modern times lack such fast firing weapon, not counting the detachable 'miniguns'. Creators of W:NO returned to the known 'pick up power ups, health and ammo' routine. While many players are used to modern solutions, where health regenerates over time and you automatically pick up ammo, this isn't such a bad idea. Old players will surely appreciate this, while other players will quickly get used to it. The story is engaging and will take us through the allied assault on Totenkopf's compound, psychiatric clinic, Berlin, London, and even the... let's just say it will have something to do with rockets. Enemies are not only soldiers but also robots, armored dogs, flying thingies very similar to manhacks from Half-Life 2, and of course various bosses. I won't hide that I really liked killing off nazi soldiers. And I really like you have the stealth option which works well. You don't have to go guns blazin', you can quietly kill the lieutenants that have the ability to call for reinforcements if alarmed. Overall this is a great game, wonderful FPS, but unfortunately, it is short. Well, can't wait to play the DLC.",

(Stealth, Head-on, etc.) + Scavenging for those that want to; semi-regenerating health for those who don't care. + Many levels of difficullity. + Humor. + Graphics in cut scenes are breathtaking. It's rendered in-engine, but it doesn't look like it. + Nice to be able to shoot people without any moral qualms. The nazis here are complete monsters! + Interesting and scary antagonists. + No QTEs! + No Multiplayer! No launch-day DLCs! No 'AAA publisherisms' AFAICT!!!  CONS: - Still just an FPS, if you don't like those - A lot of collectibles. People with OCD tendencies will want to find them all. - Gun play isn't very diverse right now. - Still pretty linnear, in order to advance a story.  OBSERVATIONS: o This feels a lot like Bioshock: Infinite, but without the magic. The run-and-gun has a very similar feeling and the alternate history is also a theme that is common to them. o You can carry a lot of weapons, as in classical FPSes. You can also dual-wield weapons if you so wish. o It's a bit like a WW2-shooter, but in the 1960s. o This game feels pretty grown-up; e.g. 'mature' in the original sense. I guess they see their target audience as grown-ups and not the audience of CoD and BF, which is mainly younger. Smart move! That audience wouldn't care less for 'Wolfenstein' ('what's that, lol?') as they already have a game(s) to play. Find your own audience and pander to them! o The protagonist looks like the original sprite for Wolfenstein 3D.  Buy it if you like the classical FPSes!",

            "review_text": "This game is one of the best narrative FPS experiences since Half Life 2, and I don't say that lightly. I've been gaming, and playing FPS since the original Wolfenstein was brand new. As shooters evolved, they sort of reached their pinnacle as singler player storytelling experiences with Half Life 2. Graphics have gotten better, dialogue punchier, twists twistier, but there really haven't been many advancements in the decade since. I fact, we've seen a devolution into quick-time events, auto-aiming, simplistic cover mechanics, and a cookie cutter formula perfected via COD games.   THIS, however, is a refreshing turn to some of the virtues gaming has forgotten: leaning mechanics, punchy weapons, twisty, intelligent level design, and most of all, a storyline and gameplay progression intertwined in a way that improves both aspects. Like Half-Life, the world you play in expands and blooms into something fresh with every chapter. The key weapon here, a laser cannon, evolves in utility and power as you go along, just like the Gravity Gun of HL2. It even plays a key part in the final sequence, like that classic tool.  The point isn't to simply draw comparison to one of the most beloved games of all time, but merely to highlight just what this game does so RIGHT, that's often missing from other top tier shooters these days. There's no fat to trim, no boring side quests, no pointless morality scale, and no inventory system to juggle. This is straight up ballsy storytelling combined with rock solid shooter mechanics. I took about 14 hours to complete this and had far more fun in that time than other AAA games I've spent far more time with. Even better, I'm eager to start again, once I whittle my to-play list down a bit.",

Laughable action sequences that destroy suspension of disbelief (and annoy).  The bad dialogue and lazy storyline ruined what could have been a great game. The worst were the interstitial gopher missions clearly designed to stretch out the gameplay. Sadly, they had the opposite effect of, what I guess, were their other purpose; namely, help me get to know the characters. I did everything in my power to avoid slowing down the pace of the game by finding toys or welding torches carelessly thrown down sewers by my so-called friends.   Unfortunately, the real levels aren't much better. I was railed through so many interesting and atmospheric locations that I wish I could have explored and interacted with more fully. As it was, it just felt like I was checking boxes on the plot outline. Walked underwater a bit: Check. Shot a few globes to make stairs: Check. Push a button: Check. Fiddle around with some junk: Check. Watch a cutscene: Check. I guess I'm done with the secret underwater stockpile. Mazel tov. Next.   The game started out with promise but hit so many sour notes that I had checked out half way through. I found myself rushing through just to get to the end, skipping the increasingly eye-roll-inducing cutscenes, and telling the main character to shut his word hole and just get on with it.

Wolfenstien: The New Order gives the player a wonderful variety of ways to work through each set piece, which are all sprinkled with a good variety of enemies. The levels avoid many of the standard FPS level settings, and each provide a new set of visuals and obstacles to work around. The weapons each have great sound and visual design, and all feel great to fire. The writing is surprisingly solid, as is the voice acting.

The combat is fun, it doesn't bring many new new things to FPS really. You can lean out of cover to aim, and it lets you manually lean for those times the cover doesn't do it when you aim. You can also 'lean' down to prone and look under some doors to shoot out people feet, which is cool.   The graphics are really awesome in this game, and well optimized. I'm running pretty close to max on a 760 and had zero issues with framerate, although the graphics menu is pretty confusing, a bit of trial and error will be needed if you don't want to just use one of the presets. Cover/objects are destroyed by gunfire, enemies will lose arms, legs, heads, or even portions of their chest to expose ribs, depending on where you shoot them. Lasers can put holes through guys or even just explode them into soup.   I also quite liked the story. They made killing Nazis fun again, although making you hate Nazis isn't difficult, and had some good dialogue. It's hard to describe more without potential spoilers so I'm just going to leave it at that.  I got this full price (not on sale) and consider it money well spent.  9/9",

It didn't pique my interest enough to keep me hooked.  It wasn't until I went back to it about 6-12 months later that I realised that after about 2 hours playtime, the whole setting changes and the game really comes into it's own. The story is fantastic, with ample opportunity to send nazi scum back to whence they came from and there are some classic storyline moments that made me laugh. After several story plot moments, I was hooked and didn't stop playing until the game was completed. My only disappointment was the overall length of the game felt a bit too short. The pace of the story was breakneck speed and you wanted to keep slaying nazis but after killing a few bosses, that was it.  Overall though, it was a very enjoyable game and the storyline was intereting and humourous in parts.

Harder difficulties are a challenge, though boss battles leave something to be desired.

'Oh no it's sad people are dying' is the essence of what you will get, then you have slaughtering nazi by hundreds and it's so much fun... In term of longevity... The minimum... 12h to finish this game of max difficulty and I could cut down at least 2h, dying cause of stupid infinite respawn or the end boss. which is much more annoying than fun to kill. basically if you do step 1 right then step 2 can be easy and if you didn't you will be screwed like I was. Oh yeah go in this place when you see nothing of what is happening. I had to go watch a video on how to kill the boss cause I didn't see anything, to only find out that I was doing it right... I was just dying to fast to see any changes... well changes that goes from state 1 to 2 where 2 is the dead boss and lots of exploding stuff in the middle...  Well all in all, the game isn't bad when you ignore the main character and focus on shooting stuff... but heil to the steam sale I would never pay 50 bucks for a 12h game... so 7something was about right (and thus however beautiful is).   So get it on sales it will be worth the money.  Luuna.",

I got this game on sale for $10 which is why I feel it deserves a good review, if I paid full price I would have felt gypped because the replay value doesn't seem all that great. In the beginning you have to chose to save one of two people which has no real impact on the game just collectables you can find and that's pretty much it so it only really pays to play through it twice. anymore than that and it will become bland.   There are also no real memorable moments in the story, and the weapon wheel in this game was clearly not designed for a mouse and key board, I cannot begin to explain how infuriating it is to die just because how bad the switching of weapons is, you get a quick draw perk which makes you draw your weapon faster, but it doesn't matter because it still takes an eternity to get to it to the weapon you want to use on wheel.   Now to why I think this game is good, it's fun killing Nazi's, the guns are cool and have alternate firing modes which are all unique and fun to use. The death animations are cool, the gore is cool, nothing walking by a guy you killed and seeing his rib cage blown out or his head completely blown off. The trusty weapon you get is upgradable and the upgrades are scattered throughout the levels.   The alternate history is interesting and you find news articles scattered around which tell you what happened an X number of years ago. I would have prefered a different way of this story telling rather than the bland reading of random ♥♥♥ articles which you can easly over look.   The game also has some cool characters in it which I don't really feel like getting into.  Lastly, there is a level of the original Wolfenstein game called 'nightmare' which you play by sleeping on a matress. This was hilarious because you have your New World Order pistol with your New World Order hand gripping it but the rest of the level is in 16 bit.  In the end I give this game an 8/10",

The R&amp;D to develop this game is commendable.  Even on the hardest mode the game is very forgiving to maintain a high level of enjoyment.   The typical dumbness of the AI is refreshingly old school. When struggling in a level I am able to use the limitations of the AI to 'cheat' my way through.  The flow of gameplay is at a great tempo. The levels of varying degrees never get boring. I love how the weapon selection resets depending on the story line &amp; the upgrade tree adds that something that makes me replay this thing once I get through.  The cutscenes are great.   A note to some with graphical issues - particularly with the win10 upgrade - do some homework on settings. For me, the changing of 3D settings helped a little but the main help was turning off power saving in graphic card general settings - watch a couple of youtube vids and the framerate picks up for this and other graphical games like FARCRY 4.  For what the game delivers it is a big tick from me. To be overly critical would be to expect chicken in a steak sandwich. If you want chicken then get a chicken sandwich.

The graphics (while I've heard horror stories of performance issues) are very good. The character models and environments are top notch and very imaginative. You've got nazi pseudo-futuristic (considering it's ~1960) cities, a nazi moon base, a labor camp, Deathhead's castle and more. Not once did I get bored with a particular level. There's always something to do whether it be the standard run 'n gun, a puzzle, or exploring the hideout and talking to the many interesting NPC's.  I'm very surprised this game did not get as much media attention or praise because it's flat out awesome. I'll list some pros and cons instead of rambling:   PROS -Great narrative. Not once did the game's store feel boring or repetitive for me. -Interesting characters. BJ himself is a badass as always, but you've also got crazy nazi leaders, energetic comrades and a slew of well thought-out side character, of which my favorites were Klaus and J. -Ton's of great guns. You've got everything from the luger, to the shotgun, to the laser cutter which is really interesting and fun to use in puzzles (it harkens memories of HL2's gravity gun) -Varied environments. I already mentioned this in my opening. -Beautiful graphics. In some games you can compliment the character models or the texturing or the effects. Wolfenstien does all of them very well. I'm not sure if the cutscenes are keyframed or motion captured, but either way, they're real time and beautiful.  CONS -Somewhat short. I completed this over a weekend, but there's always 'The Old Blood' which is a prequel to this game's story. -Performance issues. I didn't have too much trouble running this on an AMD 7950 at close to max, provided I tweaked some settings, but I did see some very noticible slowdown. There are a couple settings that you can tweak to minimize this. If you have a beefy rig like I do now, you probably wont see any issues (I've tested the Old Blood on my new rig (i7, GTX 980ti) and saw no issues.    To sum it up, this game is definitely worth the money if you ever see it on sale, and I'll probably revisit it again soon to replay it, which isn't typical for most single player FPS's.  Buy it,",

            "review_text": "An excellent reboot of an old classic. BJ Blaskowicz is back and is all out of gum, probably because they don't sell it in a world where the nazis have won WWII. Something for everyone here; fans of the classic can enjoy a flashy, visceral shoot-em-up with zero moral quandaries and a plot that can be largely ignored as you murder your way from point A to point B. Those seeking a more nuanced experience can slow it down and immerse themselves in a well-realized post-war alternate reality with well designed backdrops, solid voice acting, a cast of interesting and occasionally amusing companions and a creepy, old-school, top notch villain. Someone at Bethesda gave a damn about teh quality of their produect here, and it shows. Give it a look, I promise you wont be disappointed.   Some of the things I enjoyed: 1) An engaging plot, with entertaining characters. Not precisely memorable, but very enjoyable. Aided by solid cinematic cutscenes that are well scripted/voice-acted, but concise enough that they dont detract from the pacing, nor break immersion through melodrama.  3) Split 'timelines' offer an ever-so-slightly different storyline for a second playthrough. If you're like me, you'll play the first timeline for plot, and the second for difficulty/guns-blazing/collectible completion while still enjoying a new perspective on the sequence of events. A clever way to extend the game's value.  2) Detailed environments (e.g.;pay close attention to the scenery in the asylum - every bit of blood or bullet hole tells a story). You're encouraged to explore this via the collectibles system - I highly recommend doing so. 3) Entertaining choice of run-n-gun or pseudo-stealth. The stealth mechanics are very rudimentary, but it's still a satisfying way to play occasionally. Given that BJ is nearly invincible at most difficulty levels, even if you play like a bloodthisty maniac, you never feel forced into stealth.  4) Entertaining weapons, satisfying playstyle. The shotgun was a little under-used due to, in my opinion, a slight bias towards remaining at range once in an allout firefight.   Cheers, Auracle",

The original was part of the initial wave of innovation that set the standard for FPS mechanics, and this one followed on the heels of the abomination that is the over saturation of the genre caused by CoD4: Modern Warfare.  And oh boy did this game ever deliver.  Wolfenstein: The New Order turned an old, rehashed genre into something fun and gripping to play. I got to run, gun, slide, knife, nade, and laser beam the ever loving crap out of the Nazi hordes, the true Wolfenstein experience.   What's that you say? I can sneak around as well? And it can have a meaningful impact on how I approach a level? Fantastic! I can just toss knives at some baddies, pop a few in the head with my silenced pistol, and then swing up with my dual wielded shotguns and blast this UberSoldat in the face until he kneels before my glorious American ♥♥♥.  Now you're telling me that there is a meaningful progression tree that requires you to explore all of the mechanics presented, without feeling overbearing and forcing you into a play style? Yes, please! Numerous secrets as well, with a useful menu that allows me to search for them without consulting a 3rd party guide. And, on top of everything, an interesting story that separates The New Order from its predecessors while still fulfilling that 'kill all the Nazis' itch. I honestly wasn't expecting anything in the story department, but it was quite solid. B.J. Blazkowicz is a bit more than your cliche massively muscled 'I'm going to rip your arms off and shove them down your throat' protagonist, but not by leaps and bounds. The story is more interesting than expected, but the focus is still firmly set on gunning down Nazis at all costs.  This game renewed my interest in First Person Shooters. I didn't expect there to be any kind of innovation, but The New Order came out as an interesting game with fun mechanics, a simple but engaging story, and good level design with multiple possible plans of attack. Not everything was perfect, though; the parts where you don't have access to a gun are confusing as the enemy will just casually walk at you with a baton and gladly get their faces beaten in when they see you. The giant Panzerhund parts are a huuuuuuuuuge pain in the butt, and almost every area where stealth can be extremely useful have something that forces you to brawl, most of the time including the elite level of enemies spawning. Overall though, the game was a joy to play. I give it a 9/10.",

Classic FPS contrivances like expansive levels, hidden secrets and bits of armour (often looted from exploded Nazi robots) merge with contemporary touches, such as maps, objective markers and the ability to dual-wield basically every weapon in the game. Combine this heady mixture with incredibly satisfying gunplay that has just the right amount of recoil and extremely meaty sound effects, and you have some utterly fantastic arcadey gameplay. A real antidote to the 'bang, you're dead' twitch-gameplay of the modern military shooter.  The thing that really sold me on this game though was not the gameplay, excellent as it was, but the story. Yeah, I know. An old-school inspired shooter with a story. I was sceptical too, but this game just glows with the obvious TLC lavished on the writing; characters are all extremely likable and/or despicable as appropriate (this game made me hate Nazis even more than I did before, thanks Deathshead) and dialogue is believeable and often funny and touching. The relationships between characters feel genuine and it makes you care all that more.   B.J. especially was a revelation. When you think of characters like Doomguy or Blazkowicz, you think of the stereotypical meathead slaughter-machine. An empty vessel whose only purpose is to hold the gun and let you shoot the bad guy. But in The New Order, we see a B.J. Blazkowicz that is tired. He's seen enough death and cruelty to turn a man's soul sour, and you feel like the only thing keeping him going is the sense of moral outrage these Nazi scumbags provoke. He goes on because he must. Because of what he's seen happen to other human beings. And he gets to show a tender, even goofy and awkward side in his interactions with NPCs. I really didn't expect such a nuanced main character from a Wolfenstein game, but it's pretty amazing nonetheless.  I can't recommend this game enough. It's an awesome action shooter, full of pomp and bombast, that also knows how to add quiet moments and emotion for devastating effect. 9.5/10.",

I remember buying it on the SNES as well (was crap compared to PC)  Anyway, I had low expectations for this game but bought it on a steam sale. My expectations were un-merited. The story line is superb and highly emotive, I really felt like I gave a ♥♥♥♥ about my character and groups. Saved the young raw kid when he saved me from Robodog and then watched as he grew into the leader of the resistance. The play through for this game was short but I really enjoyed it. I felt the studio missed a trick by not allowing you maybe more open world missions from the Berlin head quaters but I guess it has to stick to its linear routes. The AI was interesting but a little unpredictable and I would have enjoyed more fire fights than just throw rockets / shotgun shells until it dies game play but that said they captured the orginal Wolf3D feel and made it relevent.  I loved the nods to the original as well, the sleep scene easter egg, the mecha boss and how the main character says 'Coming For You' just before the final boss fight. ( 'Coming For You' was what the mecha boss would say at the end of the game when you pulled him back in Wolf3D.) I really enjoyed my play though and would suggest it to anyone who likes FPS shooters in a sale. There is a certain joy about shot gunning Nazi's, blowing up Nazis and just basically destroying facist filth.  Good times. Good times.",
