I wish the speedup versions were available for Pac Man and Ms. Pac Man.  I got it for 75% off and it was worth paying that much to me.  Its a good time waster and fun in short bursts.  ",

But playing with a keyboard seems somewhat less responsive than you'd expect. You lose a lot of lives when you try to turn a corner only to have Pac decide 'nah, I'll just keep going straight'. Other than that, it's a good collection of games, and has some less-familiar titles like Pac &amp; Pal or Pac-Land.",

            "review_text": "Guys guys guys, Calm yourselves.  every game plays as intended. Privilage of playing every game in it's original format in a arcade or on Mame.  Pac-man was an up right cabinet, from microsoft return of the arcade, to Nemco All stars, to the xbox 360 pac-man, they never ever let you go full screen. it would look worse at full screen strecthed. ( gotta visualize the artari pac-man. ) yeah when you play, it looks like your playin the game on a cabinet in a wall. i would rather have the original cabinet artwork.  pac-maina is the arcade version. the worse one would be from the nes. the sound, the graphics, same from the pac man for game boy advance, a port of the arcade.  pac-land is the arcade port. it has alwyas been like that. a weirdly hard platformer, whith ghosts in cars, planes, dropping their babies from the sky.  super pac man is original arcade. ghosts vibrating every once and awhile does not mean they are getting cell calls. the game features pac-man eating food, not dots. locked behind gates. the ghosts sort of scan to see what gates are open to chase pac-man through. a better port is from the bonus game in ms. pac-man special color edtion for gameboy color.  pac and pal, later known as pac-man and chomp chomp, features almost the same gate type game play, same ghost effects. it is the original arcade format.  pac attack was relesed first on the snes, later on gameboy, and gameboy advance. the snes port was ported to the wii as well. this is the snes version complete with versus mode. gameboy, and gameboy advance versions did not feature this mode.  pac-man arrangement has 2 versions. this one is from the xbox 360 namco live arcade game. the other was an arcade game ported to gamboy advance among other systems. i would honestly like both versions in this collection.  pac-man ce was for xbox 360 only, also was on the live arcade as well. works fine. i do have ce 2 dx, so i will say get that as well. dx starts off fast, gets fasters, more options, customization. ce does not start at speed level 10 like dx does.  battle royal is a for player arcade game. there is one screen, four players step up to a jepordy like podeum, and play. game plays like one of the ce levels, the more dots eaten, the level expands. the ai is really stupid, and it has local play. it is on ps3 and 360 if it makes it easier for you to get four friends to play. when you eat a pellet, pac-man can eat ghosts and other players. all players gone, round over. i enjoy it more the pac-man vs for the gamecube and ds. plus the game looks like it could have been made for that nick show about arcade games. you know when nick had shows like hey dude, are you afraid of the dark, guts, and legends of the hidden temple. they had a show where kids answered trivia questions about video games, even got a chance to play the arcade cabinets.  all in all namco sells each game for 5 a piece at least on a modern system. wii, 3DS, xbox360. your getting all this for the price of 4 games. sure there could be improvments. dip swiches being one. pac-man jr. being another, pac-man plus is missing. full screen? never. i don't want to see pacman go from a ball to an oval. i got this game because I don't have a wii or my super nes anymore. i wanted pack attack. sure you can get it for ps2, and pc as an unlock for pac-man world 2, but take my word for it, there is nothing wrong with the emulation or gameplay. it plays just how I remember it.  thier menu shows off some stuff for the new show, it has leaderboards, achiements, has that I am playing on a tv in the wall feel when looking at the screen. the games have no problems. about the show? no i havn't seen it. i haven't seen the new teenage mutent ninja turtles, or want to. saw the original show when I was a kid, played the nes, snes, gameboy games. don't want nothing else. i like my pac-man like i like my turtles. i don't need a gimmik, i want classic. that is what this collection is. classics.

Everything plays fine, but it is locked into 720p, meaning some of the menus and the one 3D game look kind of rough. The sprite-based games look perfectly fine though, and are very sharp. This will make for a great laptop game.",

Battle royale seems WAY too small on screen but happy to be able to get the original PacMan Championship edition and the arrangement version.  Pac-Attack is oddly just in a small box on the screen... I'm not a big fan of this game but why make it so small on the screen!  Pac-Land seems to also be a bit different from the arcade and seems a bit slower but not sure if it's a different version than I recalled playing in the arcade. This one is also far too small for the screen and could have used a smaller border.",

            "review_text": "Pac-Man Museum is a tricky devil to review. There are some glaring omissions to mention right off the back: lack of customizable controls, lack of graphical settings (including resolution and fullscreen/windowed mode). At the same time, I got it on sale for $5, so I'm not bitter since I got more than my money's worth in gameplay time.  The games themselves are pretty fun for the most part! There is a surprising amount of variety, despite the fact that the same structure pops up in almost all of the games. I found Champsionship Edition to be particularly enjoyable, and I liked revisiting Pac-Man Arrangement (though I think the version on Game Boy Advance from years ago was more polished).  Speaking of polish, some games suffer from horrible control issues. Delayed response from the keyboard or gamepad make navigating tight corners at high speeds deeply frustrating, let alone trying to time difficult jumps in Pac-Mania (another game I found more polished and response on the GBA). Regular Pac-Man seems to play just fine, but Super Pac-Man and Pal &amp; Pal are particularly unresponsive.  Finally, some of the requirements to get stickers are outrageous. If you're the kind of person who will go mental if you cannot 100% a game, I'd advise staying away.  In the end, Pac-Man Museum has some highs and some lows. The games I was looking forward to playing happen to be the more polished of the bunch, so I'm content with leaving the rest unattended. For $5, it was a no-brainer, but for the current cost of $20, I would suggest you get your Pac-Man fix elsewhere.",
