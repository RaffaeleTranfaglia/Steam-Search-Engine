            "review_text": "It takes alot of processor power for not a lot of payout. Its a very frustrating platformer with a zombie theme. There is some good puzzle potential but at 80 minutes of play I uninstalled and wish I hadnt paid for this.   If you like frustration and doing the same thing over and over again then this is the game for you. Still a neat take on zombie games and for that I applaud it. Now off to uninstall and play something else.",
