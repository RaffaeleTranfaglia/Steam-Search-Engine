I played it in window mode. But be warned, if you click outside and have an overlapping window there might be the chance you will not see that area when clicking back to the game. Clipping is computed differently ;-)  For such an old game the graphics are awesome. A lot of small easter eggs and funny scenes can be found. Sound is like it was back then.",

Thanks to Steam, I finally had the chance and brought back a lot of nostaglia for games of that time. What impressed me the most is that the story is excellent. This should have been the fourth film and I do consider it a 'hidden film' of the franchise. Voice acting is great as well. A landmark game and a very enjoyable one.",

Very fun puzzle solving, if you want to it can be eaiser (path of the fist), but path of the wits gave me a challenge. Overall challenging puzzles, great old humor, many lucas arts refernces, overall for a game released in 1992 at the time it was in the top 10 adventure games, back then. Be sure to check out others like sam and max hit the road, the dig, full throttle,etc. Definatly worth the price and then some!  I have the original and yes theirs programs like scumm vm to run it, but with that comes a lot of errors and hoops to jump through yes it is nice, but after so many headaches and frustration with grim fandango (save issue 5 hours in) im glad i got this. Yes i did have one issue it said script error, but every game has an issue everyonce in awhile and you save whenever you want so get over it even back then in dos with a capabile machine it still crashed. All in all ran fine except one error which i just went back in and loaded my save and worked 100% after that!",

But this game is one of the first I've played on PC... and I have memories of being stuck in the damn desert and of that damn balloon to lead... When you're only a child, it's marking you. Without that game, I wouldn't be playing adventure games or indie games like Ben Jordan, Chzo Mythos or Barn Runner.  As it's a very old game, you have that old interface with 'Push', 'Pull', 'Use', etc.. It's perhaps a weird way to play an adventure game now but it was the norm back then.  Anyway, I managed to get stuck in the first level when I remember clearly being at ease when I was a child.  The graphics are maybe pixelated but between libraries, islands, deserts and I don't know more because I stayed stuck in the desert like before and because I'm more aware of the multiple paths you can take now than before.  So, if you're in for good memories, the game is made for you.",

Over years more and more chocolate bar released so Wispa sells fall. One day sales so low that Wispa no longer available. Ebay then filled with 'last Wispa from vending machines' for large fee.  Steam then say 'We will sell Wispa again' which made people lick lips and claim they cannot wait...  I buy Wispa, and it look like a Wispa but taste I do not remember being same. I still eat Wispa, but think it is only okay. After Wispa I go back to buying Aero. Aero much better. I am not mad I waste money on Wispa as it made me like Aero more.  What I really want to eat is Spira whilst playing Curse of Monkey Island.",

These kind of games will usually frustrate and some puzzle elements are insane with how specific they get. I think the way these games communicate with the player is off, because I find myself hitting a dead end sometimes for longer than I'd like in a point-and-click, and then suddenly I'll have that 'eurika!' moment and move on.. Maybe it's a limit of the genre, but I don't see too many leaps in this game. I'd still recommend if you like adverture games.",
