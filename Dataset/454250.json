            "review_text": "Whilst I'm only in chapter two of the game - I highly recommend it if you enjoy point and click, problem solving, and puzzles. Like another has pointed out, it is very reminiscent of Myst, among others. Everything so far has been logical - there is nothing that can't be solved if you look hard enough, and pay attention. A lot of thought went into this game, and it's noticeable, from the way the rooms are laid out, to the puzzles themselves. So far, I'm really impressed with the game.",

The puzzles work, the story's intriguing, and there are many challenges to enjoy and relish in. You may need a notebook for some puzzles, just like in the old Myst days. You actually feel pretty rewarded after completing some tough ones, there's a lot to love in the environments and the overall atmosphere the game presents.  I recommend it to people who enjoy problem-solving, Myst, Myst-like titles, and want to experience a certain sense of wonder.",

I had to use a guide on a few of the puzzles otherwise I would have been stuck indefinitely, but most were doable.  Though my cons list is bigger than my pros, I really did enjoy this. 8/10  Pros:   - Puzzles make you think and are fair for the most part.  - Art style is decent throughout  Cons:  - The planetarium puzzle(s) still make no sense to me.  - A bit too many obscure codes that you have to recall from random posters.  - Collectibles are hard to see in certain setups.  - Weak story.",

            "review_text": "The first two thirds of the game are challenging and fun, and set up an interesting little mystery.  Unfortunaly the last third of the game really fell apart for me. The puzzles stopped being challenging and became much more obscure, and the solutions didn't always make sense. They also became very non-linear which got extremely overwhelming. Some of the puzzle logic got pretty thin.  There's a couple of puzzles that aren't really deducable, but are instead a huge time sink of fiddling with matching pictures up. I much prefer a riddle that needs to be solved. Also, I would have appreciated the option to keep codes and notes in the inventory so that they are easier to refer to later, instead of relying on memory or taking hard-copy notes.  Unfortunatly the game got so irritating in the last third that I was just waiting for it to end, instead of being interested in the conclusion. And the end of the story is very lackluster.   I liked this game ok overall.",

            "review_text": "This was a very difficult decision, but ultimately I'm going to mark Eyes of Ara as 'not recommended'. I put about ten hours into this game, and decided to quit playing in area three (four if you count the tutorial). The puzzles were good, fanatastic in some cases, but the developers relied way way (way way way) too much on pixel hunting. I would say a good four of my ten hours were spent scouring every corner looking for the half-hidden items, some of which were necessary to progress. It basically became no fun after a while, and after I learned that   there's some backtracking for collectibles  , that finally broke me, since I had wasted an hour already looking for the last thing to make the thing work.  If the developers ever add some sort of indication that you're not done, like say a marker that tells you if you've found all the interactibles in an area, for example, then I'd probably finish the game and change my vote. But right now, I just can't play pixel hunt any more.  Edit: Steam says 7.7 hours, but my save file in game says ten, if you're wondering at the difference.",
