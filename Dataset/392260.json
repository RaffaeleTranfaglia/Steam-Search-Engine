            "review_text": "After 4h of playtime as of writing this, I'd say this is a pretty fun game, but maybe more of a 'pick up on sale' game then a must have for roguelike/dungeon crawling fans.  The story mode is your tipical linear progression, go-to-that-dungeon-for-that-quest type, with a central hub of merchants to sell your loot and restock on potions. I personally don't really care for the story, but if you dig evil wizards doing evil ♥♥♥♥ with evil magic, this is the title for you.  Then it has the actual roguelike game mode, called Gauntlet. You start on a dungeon at level 1, with only a sword and potions, and you keep going through the floors until you die, collecting loot and leveling up as you go. Every X amount of floors there's a boss who is higher level than you character and can screw you if you are bad like me, but drops some good loot when killed.  The actual mechanincs and balance of the diferent types of weapons and spells seems good from what I've played so far. The combat is a fast paced style of turn-based, where you either attack, move, use a potion, or switch weapon/spell. But for example, a Lance allows you to move and attack on the same turn, and in some situations (with the right mob placement) kill multiple enemys in one turn; however, it's a two-handed weapon, meaning you can't use a shield with it, like you can with sword or an axe, meaning you can't block attacks. Also, if you play Hearthstone, think of your potions as Reno Jackson - they always heal you to full. You also have the system of when you level up puting points into your stats and into your spells, and a pretty cool system for your gear where every piece will have a rank, wich goes up by using that piece - for example a weapon rank goes up by killing things with it, and every time you go up a rank it rolls a new affix on that weapon, wich can be the damage or another random property (think Diablo 3 loot). So your common drop can actually be better then a rare drop if you have used it more. You get bonus XP if you kill every enemy and open every chest on a floor (it tells you when you do), and you can use the map to teleport to various waypoints spread across the floors (the entrance and exit, when you find it, act as waypoints to). You need keys to open the chests, the keys drop from enemys, so if you find a chest and don't have a key, you can always go to it later easily. And from my experience, you always get enough keys for all the chests.  All in all, it's a fun time killer, with some good ideas from games you problably played before, and an interesting art style. My only gripe so far is that the tiles out your character's vision just disapear and pop in when you move constantly, and since you move relatively fast out of combat it can be a bit anoying, but I eventually got used to navigating that way.  EDIT: After recent updates, most of my issues have been solved. Definite recomendation.",

            "review_text": "Firstly this is not a hard-core Rogue like game. It isn't ADOM or Nethack. It is however pretty good at being a rogue lite game.  The story mode is 'meh' I played for about 2 hours and stopped bored. The real meat and drink is the proper rogue like mode with perma death and no town building.  Even that though is not particularly punishing (at first) the mechanics are good in combat. Bows for ranged, chakras for multiple ranged but lower impact, axes for immediate AOE, spears for move and attack in the same turn, sword for the strongest single attack on a single opponent in one turn. Staffs are similar to swords really, so there is that.  Every weapon has a role to play, and they level up as you play, getting stronger the more you use them - up to a point (they have a highest potential level themselves).  Interesting decisions. Do you carry on using your level 7 maxxed out bow - or start levelling the weaker but potentially more awesome in the long run level 8 -11 bow? You'll do less damage with it for a while but it might pay off... or using it might get you killed.   Learning the mobs. Some attack and move, some have effects like Silence, Ice, firball and a rock/cage Hmmm Magic? Getting one spell really high level sounds great, but mobs have resistances and you need the right reagents for the spell and most spell trees use different reagents. With all your level points in one magic field you risk running out of reagents for that field and having tons left for spells you haven't learned.  There is no right and wrong yet that I can see, the game gets progressively harder. You will die at some point, but not in the first 10 minutes unless you are a really bad player and don't pay attention.  The graphics are pretty good. They remind me of Torchlight (as does the music) Not really that bothered with the GFX though, the solid gameplay is what I bought a ticket for.  A few gripes. Hitting a square diagonally behind where a mob or map feature is can sometimes be a bit hit and miss, other than that, it's not hard core, but it is very solid and rewarding. There are plenty of hardcore options ADOM, ToME Angband and decent graphical ones like Dungeons of Dredmoor. Most available here on Steam or free. If you want hardcore get one of those, they are all great. If you want more polished and slightly easier, get this. It's also great.",
