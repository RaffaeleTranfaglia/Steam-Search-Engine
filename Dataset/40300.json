You're just thrown on to this island without any handholding. You have to earn respect and start as a lowlife commoner. The game will often trick you with unfortunate scenarios.   Overall, I'd say it's worth buying on sale. 7.5/10 for me",

            "review_text": "Risen, like most of Piranha Bite's previous efforts, is kind of a misinterpreted RPG. First of all, the game doesn't just throw you into the world knowing certain basic skills (like sneaking, pickpocketing, lock-picking, etc). Anyone expecting 'Skyrim with pirates' is going to be terribly disappointed, not because Risen is a bad game in itself, but because it's made to appeal a hardcore RPG crowd that enjoys games with more depth on characters, quest completion, exploration and looting. Risen excels in adding depth to all these elements, but that's not without its obvious flaws.   Combat, while rewarding, feels excessively clunky. The camera usually tends to go a bit crazy when tackling with more than one enemy and animations look unnatural. It isn't until you begin to train on fighting skills and learn decisive combat moves like parrying when it starts to get fun and challenging.   During the first couple of hours you're going to feel really lost. Without the help of quest markers you're going to have to find out how to continue with the quest on your own, which encourages you to rely on yourself instead of following a guided path with the help of a medieval GPS tracking system. There are no exclamation or interrogation marks on top of people's heads, so talking to them and finding out is the only way to begin quests. Memorizing where each character lives/works is recommended because you'll go back to them again and again on different missions, though Risen doesn't make that process easy either since almost all of the characters look exactly alike with some exceptions like hair color or clothes. Instead, you'll remember them because they each serve a different purpose in the community they belong to and feel like an important part of the world.   Certainly, what I'm enjoying most about the game is the decision making. The island is mainly divided into three factions: The Inquisition who believe the artefacts from the temples that have just risen should be kept away because of the unknown power that lies within them; the Don's Men, who don't believe that the artefacts have any hidden power and instead want to loot these temples to sell them for gold; and the novices and mages who were trained by the Inquisition but do not want to become part of the Order; they sort of go by their own principles. The conflicts between both opposing factions are shown throughout the whole game and you will constantly be asking yourself which is actually the one you feel at ease with. The Inquisition, while imposing very restrictive laws and obliging every foreigner to enlist as a Warrior of the Order, certainly has a point when it comes to keeping the artefacts safe in case they have some hidden power. The Don, while being much less restrictive and welcoming, are all petty thieves who abuse shop owners for 'protection' money. Each of them tries to lure you into joining their forces and give very good arguments (for example, the Don's men constantly tell you how the Inquisition doesn't really care about the island or the poor, while these same people are extorting money and commiting terrible crimes; on the other hand, the Inquisition still preaches about saving the people but are still very restrictive in certain aspects).   When it comes to the looting system in this game, it isn't bad nor impressive either, it just serves its purpose: you collect things and then if you're experienced enough you can craft something with them.   Graphically, the game is a hit and miss. The environments are lush and vibrant with life. The jungles look impressive because of the amount of vegetation everywhere, and shader/shadow effects look great too. Still, pop-up textures are fairly common here and there and characters look somewhat ugly.   With all this said, Risen makes up for a believable and immersive experience due mainly to its story, its characters, and its rewarding quest-making, but can only be enjoyed if you can overlook its flaws.",

            "review_text": "Risen is definitly an old school RPG, in that nothing, I repeat NOTHING is spoon fed to you. At best, you get a couple of generic markers for the general location of where you may need to go for some quests, but for the most part it is entirely up to you to keep track of who is who, where people and places are at, and what you need to do next. Unlike games such as Skyrim, in Risen you are forced to figure almost everything out for yourself. Quests take awhile to finish, and are arched out rather than radiant so that you don't feel as if you are repeatedly doing the same stuff over and over. Hours will fly by as you wander about the island and learn how to progress.  Combat is on the wonky side, and can take a bit to get to learn. Many creatures have attacks that are, IMO, a bit too fast and overpowered, and require a little more than just skill to get through. However, there are many things you can take advantage of in order to make it though the combat system.   Graphics wise, i would say that the game has aged considerably well. While most textures arent remarkable or even close to realistic, they are far from being immersion breaking or ugly. In fact. some areas are quite beautiful, and the soundtrack is one of the best from the time.   If you have a short attention span, or don't have much experience with RPGs in general, this game may not be the best place for you to get your feet wet. However, with how often these games go on sale I would highly suggest that you put at least a couple of hours into the game.  As a side note: there is a special place in hell for gnomes. Screw you, you short ugly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.",

            "review_text": "After the technical disaster of Gothic 3, Piranha Bytes left their estranged publisher, JoWood, with the Gothic franchise. JoWood proceeded to prove that the failure was their own fault, by releasing the unspeakable horror that was Gothic 3: Forsaken Gods, and the complete snoozer that was Arcania: Gothic IV. Meanwhile, Piranha Bytes started from the ground up with a new world, new story, and new publisher, and gave us Risen, an RPG which restored faith in their ability to provide an essential open-world fantasy RPG. It's not perfect, but compared to Gothic 3, it is a masterstroke. The combat is skillful, though the auto lock-on can be a bit irritating. The variety of spells adds more interesting options to combat and exploration. The NPC's are all well-written and acted, including characters voiced by film veterans Andy Serkis, John Rhys-Davies, and Lena Headey. The world is not to Elder Scrolls scale, but is full of hidden loot, challenging enemies, and sprawling yet expertly designed dungeons. Altogether, the game stands as a supreme tribute to the first two Gothic games that made Piranha Bytes a revolutionary figure in the RPG genre back in the years around 2000.  Pretty much the only thing I really disliked about this game was how much it got me to love it. Unfortunately, due to questionable decisions and a hope to really try something new, Piranha Bytes sunk the franchise into relative mediocrity with Risen 2: Dark Waters, only to be slightly redeemed in Risen 3: Titan Lords.",

It's a great roleplaying game in my oppinion and it managed to do what Gothic 1-3 did wrong. Good for RPG junkies.",

Stay away if you don't like a 90's-era action RPG feel but if you do, you'll find an enjoyable experience here. I shouldn't neglect to mention that the soundtrack is pretty solid as well.",

            "review_text": "Firstly I am going to say this is a decent game as I bought it cheap and ended up playing it for 80+ hours - to completion.  Apparently Risen was created by these guys who also made Gothic 1 and 2 - some sort of great RPG games of history.  The game is a third person adventure where you play the role of sarcastic stowaway who is shipwrecked on an exotic island in a world where the gods have left and now suffers from the Titans that were subsequently unleashed, creating havoc and destruction.  The graphics and sound are quite good and the island feel is spot on. We have beaches, waterfalls, night and day, thunder and lightning etc. The way you interact with the environment is pretty easy and well thought out, left click to engage, right click to block and middle click to engage combat.  Your inventory is infinite and therefore unrealistic. However, this means you don't have to worry about petty management but immerse yourself in the gameplay. Although many times I found myself carrying 50 swords and 4 shields! In your travels you can pick herbs as you would have in Oblivion and Skyrim. You can also harvest bits of dead animals that you kill. The system that allows you to create potions and spells from these activities is pretty basic but invaluable later on in the game.  I played the game in normal difficulty all the way through and I have to talk about the combat. It is brutal. Basically you are ship wrecked nobody and the island is home to dangerous wild animals like wolves, boars and undead creatures who will EAT YOU FOR BREAKFAST in no time. BE WARNED. This is the first game, ever, that I had to save after every combat, and even in mid combat. The combat is challenging and requires you to block a lot and look for openings. It requires you to carefully watch what your enemy does to see if there is a pattern in their behaviour and find an optimum time to advance and strike. Often I had to back track or run to a single pathway or ledge so that my opponents could not gang up on me. Many opponents will circle you and attack from behind or the side. You will appreciate how it feels to be hunted. As your character grows and becomes more powerful, this does not change!  The game looks and feels a bit like my beloved Oblivion, however it suffers in comparison. The game world is smaller and with only two factions, there is less interaction with people. The limited XP available forces you to choose fighter or mage, although you can choose to go 'Paladin' and make and use your own magic scrolls. The end game story involving a volcano and titan battle seems trivial compared to the mighty end game battle in Oblivion. Saying all that, I really did enjoy exploring the island and progressing through the story. The combat really made me mad on many occasions and my failure in that partly explains my need to complete the game. I really did enjoy those occasions where to progress the storyline I had to transform into a little snail or use levitation or telekinesis. However, these opportunities were quite rare and the game would have benefited with more of that stuff.  Unlike another game I tried to play recently (cough - The Witcher), the designers of this game really did a great job matching the potential game quests with open play. Many times I travelled around and did stuff in my own personal random order and the game mostly was able to make sense of all that and update the game world in accordance. That was quite impressive. For example, I did not speak to this creepy looking guy in the Bandit Camp but explored the whole area quite extensively. When I finally spoke to Mr Creeps my conversation options were amended to reflect quests I had already completed.  Good little game, recommended to those who would like to visit a pacific island like Hawaii and have patience for the combat. Remember to save often though!",

            "review_text": "After finishing Skyrim I did not want to play through it again and waste another a hundred hours of my time in this complex sandbox game. However, I was still addicted to its sandbox formula and the kind of freedom it offered. So I began my quest to seek something that could cure my itch. I came across the Gothic and Risen series and read up on its development history so I purchased both to see if they would satisfy my itch. Being a huge Skyrim fan, I will be making many comparisons between the two games within this review. You have been warned.  Plot: 3/5  Personally, I enjoy playing games that have a deep, well woven plot. I understand open ended gameplay is a big thing right now (e.g. Dayz, Minecraft), but for me I find that after playing these games for a period of time, they begin to feel mechanical and repetitive. The plot in Risen can't be considered superb, but it does its job to keep me engegd the whole time. The player character possesses a very bland personality and his voice acting is also very stiff. In my opinion, I would rather prefer to not have the player character be given an identity or voice at all. A good RPG should be immersive. So much so that the player should feel like they are exploring a whole new world and their actions are going to have an impact on this world. Without this immersion, the game becomes a grind just like those free to play mmorpgs. Elements like drugs and prostitution are also sort of lame. They aren't outrageously over the top like the way The Witcher does it and they aren't exactly sensual and emotional like Mass Effect or Dragon Age. However, I really liked the way factions were implemented in this game. It was very hard for me to decide which factions to join at the start of the game because I couldn't tell who were the good guys or bad guys.  Gameplay mechanics: 2.5/5  This is the part of the game that really didn't sit well with me. First of all, I hated Risen's map system. I understand that for authenticity sake the player must first seek out an expert to draw a map before it becomes available for use, but even then, the map was confusing to use and I probably spent half of my time in this game running around and unable to find my way. The quest prompts were also too vague and I find the inclusion of the conversations with the quest giver to be utterly pointless. The varieties of creatures to fight in this game were also abysmal. Once the Lizardmen made their appearance encounters with other enemies became greatly reduced. To be fair the gameplay mechanics isn't all bad. I really liked some of the skills in this game. For example, I had a blast floating around with the levitation spell, and the in game traps were also well designed too.  Music: 2.5/5  I may not be an music expert, but Skyrim's Dragonborn theme song and the female vocals that play during Dragonage's menu screen still resonates in my head from time to time. Risen lacks the sort of musical score which can make a memorable impact on its players but they are still nice to listen to. I do like some of the music that plays during battles or in the background as I explored the wilderness. For example, as I was exploring a dark ruin, the creepy ambient sound and loud shrieks really put a chill down my spine.  Graphics: 4/5  Depending on your systems, this game can be very pretty. The lighting and reflections were gorgeous and I took a lot of screenshots of the beautiful scenery.   Final Score: 3/5   A good game, but only if you got it as part of a deal.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Skyrim通关以后不愿意再打开算是一种精神洁癖，认为游戏玩通关了就应该放下了， 繁复去玩让人头疼。但是对于sandbox游戏的热爱让我又开始寻找上古的替代品， 于是知道了gothic和risen系列， 只购买了piranha – bytes工作室制作的那几部。  既然玩了，难免要和上古做个比较。   故事情节：3/5   之所以把故事放在最前面讲，是因为我是比较看重这个部分的。有一些游戏貌似很自由很开放，你在这个世界什么都可以做，例如最近热门的那些僵尸类游戏，但是玩久了你就会觉得有种机械工的感觉， 不停重复去做一件事情，乏味的很。而risen在故事设计上只能算是刚刚好，首先主角的性格就不那么明晰，配音也很僵硬，不如没有配音。 其余的配角的性格反超主角，这也是为什么大家都很喜欢patty而嫌弃男主，就是这样的原因。 一个好的rpg，要让玩家真正完全带入到角色中去，让自己感觉这个屏幕里奔跑的小人就是我自己，而不是一个杀怪的苦力。游戏中的抽大麻和妓女的设定觉得很无聊， 根本就是打擦边球，还不如直接干到巫师的级别，很黄很暴力， 要么就学学质量效应和龙纪元，玩玩暧昧。但是值得肯定， 游戏里游戏的阵营设定确实不错，这也是加分的一点，一开始确实让人不知所措，我该相信谁的话总是萦绕在脑中。最后犯贱的看了攻略才算石头落地。  游戏设定：2.5/5  为什么给了这么低的分数， 也许这样的系统设定真的不太适合我。。。首先习惯了上古那种地图以后这个游戏完全是生命在吐槽的感觉。。。我倒不反对地图为了逼真要真的去请人画地图，或者从一些探险者身上去扒取，我无法忍受的是地图给了就和没给一样，有些时候时间根本没有浪费在剧情上， 完全是浪费在迷路上了， 任务写的不明不白也就算了，你把一些有的没的对话写在上面是闹哪样啊！ 强烈不建议没玩过此类rpg的同学玩这个游戏，会十分不适应。。。要时刻记住，做好一个rpg游戏应尽的本分，不要弄弄就变成生存游戏了哦，玩家会闹情绪的说。而且怪物的种类真的少到要大姨妈都不想来了， 后面蜥蜴人一出来其他怪物数量大减啊，蜥蜴人是在刷存在么， 根本就是偷懒好么！ 但是一些技能真的很好玩，那个悬浮技能啊，飘来飘去的， 还有各种机关陷阱。。。  音乐： 2.5/5  好的音乐是什么。。。就是skyrim一打开那两句：dovakin dovakin，或者龙纪元一开始那个哼哼唧唧老娘们的吟唱， 一辈子都忘不掉。。。你问我risen是什么开头音乐。。。昨晚刚玩呢都不记得了我打开再听听。。。。 一些环境和战斗的音乐还是比较好的，特别是进第一个ruin的时候那个鬼叫给我吓毁了。。。  画面：4/5 在那个年代应该算不错的了吧。。。还是截了一些比较美丽的图片。。。  总体3/5， 百分制就60分。。。艾玛。。。尊低。。。",

Sometimes when buying old games you take into factor, how well made is the game? can I still appreciate the graphics? Is this gonna entertain me for a good amount of time? how's the gameplay?  Well based on my opinion, I can answer all those questions with yes.   1 this is an open world game with good amount of choices for you to go through and live in the game (how you get or choose a class is an example of how your choice greatly affects your character).   Graphics may be a bit outdated (especially on female NPC's) but isn't that far to what we have today. Things to do and dungeons are all in a good amount to keep you entertained.  I've clocked about 70 hours into playing this game, and gameplay is sweet. fighting is awesome and the use of blocking is really needed (I find this 'rare', and a good experience).   CONS:  Funniest thing is the awkward jumping. (walking, running and fighting are good)  Fast travel is fairly late in the game.  The whole map is kinda small but just enough? (especially your gonna walk a lot)  Occasionaly NPC can be out of place. (I've only experienced this like 3x at most, the most memorable is when i found phil near the volcano ruins and had to save him from dying.)  No character creation (you're basically stuck with the nameless hero guy from the get go.)  But hey! Lore is good, there's a dash of politics, moral choices, getting into trouble for accidentaly hitting someone, accidentaly killing an npc (that might be a quest holder), betrayal. etc. ^_^",

I was more than interested to see if the game was going to be a continuation of the Gothic series and whether it could capture the atmosphere of the world of Gothic. I would classify this under two headings.   With respect to the continuation of the story, there was not much and there wasn't much they could do about it probably, what with the copyright issues and all. They did however use the same theme of what was left of the world after the events in Gothic 3 (won't mention them here to avoid spoilers).  As for gameplay, I was not disappointed though I did feel that there were several areas they could have improved. Firstly, the world is not open; it is quite small and limited, even compared to RPGs at around the same time. Secondly, the gameplay is similar to that of Gothic 3, which brings the advantage of commonality for Gothic players but has a Learning Curve for new players (people who bought Risen and never played the Gothic titles). Thirdly, the magic combat/use is lacking; you can only have one active spell effect at a time. For example, (you cannot have boost armor and boost strength at the same time).   So far as the story goes, I can say that Piranha did a good job and the Gothic fans should not be disappointed; at least I wasn't but of course that's just my opinion.I just felt the ending was a little too quick...

It isn't often that RPGs will let you just stumble onto and use high level main quest items before you even figure out what the main quest is). Like 'Gothic' things degenerate into a linear monster grind in the very last hours of the game, but that's a minor quibble (someday PB will nail an ending...someday). Still, a great ARPG.",

Brugle/10  Don't get fooled my my 6hr game time, I have 60+ hours after finishing the game in offline mode (Steam needs to fix this)  The combat is challenging and fun even if it's too simple, the game has a simple RPG format, it drives you to finish it once you start playing, much like other RPGs. The game has a decent soundtrack, the graphics are fine even though the character models aren't really pretty and are too repetitive  The leveling up system is a bit mixed up and not easy to understand at first, you need to play to level up your skills , you can't do that without money which you'll only get later in game.  Voice acting can be really shallow at times.  But what I like most about this game is the replay value, the quests aren't repetitive, and each playthrough can have different outcomes.  Yes, I would recommend this game and I'm going to play the sequel soon.",

In my opinion this is second best Piranha Bytes game after “Gothic II” (though original “Gothic” is really great, too). What we have here is an open world (but if some places are closed in the beginning for story reasons, and others’ dwellers beat the crap out of you if you go there too early), fairly interesting story, three ways to develop your character by joining one of two factions, fencing system that gets more complicated and effective when you upgrade your skills. Levelling up here just like original “Gothic” games require a mentor, which is good, and not all the skills are available for all the factions. Besides combat skills there are crafting, magical and thievery skills. Story is divided into few chapters, and finishing one changes a world a bit, adding some secondary quests and new enemies.  Overall this role-playing game definitely worth a play.",

            "review_text": "Personal rating: 8/10 Replayability: Medium Budget: Worth it.  Lenght: A few days to a week.   I'm not sure what to think of Risen. The company behind Risen made Gothic, a series that I loved. Gothic has a tragic story, funding was cut from the expansion pack to the third installment, resulting in a buggy game that felt unfinished, and had the wrong voice-actors. The dreaded fourth installment that the orginal company wasn't even part of, killed the series, and I hear this is why they started Risen on the side.   While I was initially excited about Risen, I feel like Risen is some sort of attempt from the company's side to 'win back' their original ideas for gothic. It feels like they're trying to make the same game, but different.   Still, Risen has a decent story, but Risen is a series, and the third installment just game out. I'll try not to judge Risen 1 on the sequels, but it's hard, because frankly Risen 2 feels like they retconned a lot of Risen 1 in an attempt to reboot their franchise as a sort of 'pirate age' age game, even though it clearly felt like a high-fantasy gothic medieval game in the first installment.   Separately though, the games are quite good, it's just a bit of a snag to get over how poorly they connect, despite several characters making appearances in both games.   In many ways, Risen perfectly embodies the spirit of Gothic and does provide some not-seen-before elements. Where in Gothic, you felt like you were the nameless master-mind behind a gang of anti-heroes who follow you out of some misguided sense of loyalty (honor among thieves, I guess) rather than true friendship, always facing challenges in a hostile world as you go about, in Risen you feel like people actually have a more 'human' relationship towards you. Sure, you're still a nameless guy but apart from a select few individuals, you're truly alone this time, but your friendships in the game are based on actual frienship, meaning the character actually has some relationships with people.   Risen in no way beats or threatens the legacy of the 3 real gothic games, but if you liked gothic, you NEED to play Risen too.   Fun fact: Many fans believe that unofficially, Risen is set several years in the future of the original gothic trilogy. Read more on this theory on the internet.",

That makes you feel somewhat powerful and it's more rewarding this way; -pickpocketing is fun; (you can even steal items in use :D) -unlimited inventory, no carrying weight -leveling up and spending learning points is highly rewarding and satisfying -simplistic and cool UI  Things I don't like:  -the combat and it's animations are pretty clunky and it's kinda hard to excell at it -lockpicking involves luck, not real 'skill'. Locks are not random and you can abuse this pretty easy with a quicksave. I'm not really complaining about this, but it could've been better. -occasional bugs -lacks of minimap. I used to have a compass on my screen but that dissapeared somehow.  Others:  -You can fast travel only when you get to chapter 2.

So I gave the game another try, searching for   any   redeemable quality. I have to say I really like the alchemy system, smithing, and how the game make use of magic. Creating scrolls yourself and whatnot. It is a hassle, but a rewarding one. I like it how you can use a 'Joke' spell to make up with a character you previously angered. That's about it, I guess.  Moving on. Halfway inside the main quest, I sighed in despair. Realizing that I don't even   care for the Main Character   for me to start caring for any its secondary characters. And that's a huge flaw, considering I play RPGs for its main content: the storyline and a good vast of characters to help strengthen it. Though some RPGs are lacking in story, they backed it up with an amazing combat system, for instance. Or its huge amounts of loots. Risen lacks both.

You are given choices in the story to choose what type of character you will develop, depending on the faction you choose. You can be a warrior type, mage or a hybrid of the two. I found the story to be decent. Exploration was rewarding. Combat is pretty difficult, especially at the start. Getting 1 or 2 shotted by enemies is pretty common. You'll have to study your enemies to figure out their movements and time your attacks and blocks exactly right. As the game goes on, combat gets easier as you gain better armor, range weapons/magic and your attacks grow stronger. There are some puzzles, but none that are too obtuse. All-in-all I found this to be a good game and worth your money, especially with some of the discounts going on where you might be able to pick up a pack Risen 1-3 games for a big discount.",

            "review_text": "INTRO Risen is one of those games that will ♥♥♥♥ you off many times, i have rage quit many times due to being killed by lizardmen and tons of other creatures. If you think you're going to be a baddass from the first  5-10 hours you are wrong, you start off as a worthless piece of s**t with no armor and no good weapons. At the begginning you are given a choice to follow the Order (The 'Law' enforcers) or the Dons men (Thieves, rogues and some warriors). A mage would gladly follow the order and a thieve, archer or sword fighter would follow the dons men.  MAGIC In about 10-15 hours into the game (If you followed the Order) you will obtain magical abilities. Now, don't get too excited, (TES fans, i am one myself) magic in risen is not over the top or Really Awesome! like in TES (The Elder Scrolls), you have your three crystals, Fireball, Ice, and Magic bullet/missile, these are self explanatory but magic bullet is basically a machingun spell :). You also can create scrolls with the ingredients and a quil and of course empty scroll paper and the rune. Anyone can use Scrolls but you need training to make them and use crystal magic.  Combat - Melee Melee weapon vary, you have your basics like; Sword, Two Handed, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Sword and axes, and many more like; Machete, Demon Blade, Titan Wing and many more. You can block with a shield or you two handed weapon like a staff or sowrd. Axes are slow but more powerful. You can dodge by double tapping W, A, S or D, and you dodge in that direction. People say combat is boring i think it is great. You can upgrade you Staff, axe, sword and your ranged weapons of course and gain new abilities like; Interupt an attack and more combos and more.  Combat - Ranged You got your bows and crossbows (Most should be self explanatory). Bows use arrows and Crossbows use Bolts. What else to say?  Alchemy I cannot stress enough about how much i LOVE alchemy in this game, its not the best but its great for what it is. You can buy recipes or find them, they tell you the ingredients you need for potions and food (Thats for the cooking segment), you also need Vials for the potions and sometimes water. You need to go into nature and collect plants and herbs to use for the potions for example a Health potion needs 3 healing herbs and some other stuff. You also need to have the alchemy skill to perform ANY of this.  Cooking Cooking important, fried meat could be the difference between life and death. You will need a frying pan and raw meat to use a fire, you can also use a cauldron to make soups and stews, you may find apples, onions, meat, carrots and many other ingredients threw out your experience, these may be used to create meals to eat. Some food restores healt and others restores mana but the best restore both.  The World You will die MANY times if you are not prepared or just a plain dumbass, be prepared, always have 10+ health potions &amp; mana potions for your safety, remember to block and use all skill applicable in combat. HAVE FUN  Final Verdict Risen is not the best RPG but it certainly is something new in an old genre. If you enjoy hard but rewarding games than risen is for you, if you liked gothic Risen is for you.",

Your hero doesn't learn stuff out of nowhere after levelling up, i.e. distributing skill points. Instead you gain LP (learning points) which you can spend at trainers (NPCs who teach you stuff). + Class system doesn't restrict your play style too much. You can be a dumb bandit but still can use magic via scrolls if you want for example. + Reminds me of other A-RPGs I enjoyed such as Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning, Witcher 1, Fable: The Lost Chapters and Dark Souls. + Fast travel system. +    I love some of the animations in the game. Particularly lizardman idles where they snap a fly in the air while standing around or look around like a paranoid or shaking their head. They are strangely cute and realistic &lt;3     Bad: - No respec system in the game (can be done via console commands, cheating) - Sometimes you might wonder why you couldn't complete a quest. There is no handholding to the point you start wondering if the game is bugged but most of the time it is not. You probably need to talk to somebody but you haven't. - Some may find the combat too difficult at the start. - No sprinting. You can get Speed magic which is basically sprint which should have been in the game from the start instead of a spell which you can get quite later in the game.  Of course recommended. 9/10.

The graphics are a little dated, but the game is several years old, so that is expected.  The combat does suck at the start of the game. I gets MUCH better once you level up a bit, put some points into your chosen weapon skill, and get some decent gear. The combat is very unforgiving, timing your attacks and blocks is essential, especially against harder opponents. In the early game, expect to get killed by wild animals. In the late game, expect to get killed by hordes of human enemies, lizardmen, ghouls. Any time you meet an enemy you've never seen before, be cautious, they are probably tough. Your combat options are limited, though they do get better as you train in your chosen weapon type. Eventually you gain access to different moves depending on the direction you hold while you attak, longer combos, parrys, parrys that damage the opponent if you are close enough, etc. Honestly the melee combat reminds me a lot of Skyrim, not the best, but solid enough. The storyline is good. Not the most original, but still a good solid story. The game forces you to choose between joining the bandits and criminals, or joining the totalitarian religious organization that has taken over. The is no neutral path, and your two choices are between two relatively unlikeable groups. Sort of morally ambiguous like The Witcher.  This game does not hold your hand. You have to figure out many things for yourself. Like secret doors and spots where you can dig for treasure do not have nametags above them like most containers and switches, and things you can interact with. This forces you to actually search for these things instead of having them revealed to you whenever you get close. The world map and area maps suck. They can give you a general idea of where you are going, but they are fairly undetailed and only show major roads and trails. If you leave the main roads to explore, you are pretty much on your own. Though it is usually worth wandering around a bit. I really enjoy the game and give it an 8/10. Good open world RPG that is difficult but not impossible.",

From rags to riches, you start hitting overfed mosquitos with a stick, advance yourself through ranks as a trustee of 2 different factions( one in two denominations ) to find yourself hitting more fantasy lore revered monsters with a stick that has a pointy metal edge on top.  You get to traverse the maze of unmarked investigations, one thing already dead within the real of video game convenience as well speech checks, that if taken too far can land you with floor sweeping job, or without your head. Ah the possibilities.  The cons :  The game however, can be a bit too formulaic in gatekeeping certain content, directly tied in your equipment upgrades through main mission. The crafting is pretty basic and the advantages of advancing certain skill paths pretty unclear, especially that you will find yourself short on training points and gold most of game. Even if alot of quests leave you to your own devices in figuring out the solution, often they aren't as intuitive as they could. Resorting to a guide, if not often, isn't anything unusual when it comes to Risen. I mean, there are a lot of games to play.  Overall if you know and enjoy games like Gothic 1 and 2, this game will click with you. If you like map markers and a combat where your character sommersaults from opponent to opponent with minimal effort on your side, it won't be a worthy purchase. If you like Witcher games, this might be a 50/50 roll.",

            "review_text": "A very solid RPG. It takes the Gothic formula but makes it more appealing to new players.   This was my first game that introduced me to Gothic and Risen franchises, while I loved Gothic after playing this , I feel this is more balanced . Graphics are a bit dated but still beautiful to look at .  Dialogues have a bit of humor in them, maybe also because some voice acting is clumsy but it kinda fits in with person you are speaking to.  Combat is alright, it takes a bit of practice to get good at and it feels more and more satisfying with every mob you kill. side stepping is a bit bugged tho.  Quests are good (more or less) , chapter 1 is one of the best RPG experiences I had. The rest is more of 'fetch this, find this' a lot of the quests are hit&amp;miss.  The world is made quite well and the dungeons are good, could have been better tho. It was quite immersive for me  I give it a 8-9/10 depending on how many bugs I encounter, played it 2 times and my experiences were a bit different.",

            "review_text": "From the creators of Gothic1, 2, and 3 before they split from their parent company, Risen is an old school RPG that doesn't hold your hand. By this I mean it doesn't give you quest markers, obvious clues or save you from impending doom. What it does offer is a vast island to explore with an epic story driven by magic and mystery. If you are a fan of the Pre-Gothic4 Gothic series I advise you to pick this game up. It's all that Gothic3 should have been on release; polished, fun and enormous. Just a warning: The first half of the game is an overworld exploration and the second half is mostly dungeon crawling.",

            "review_text": "This is a very fun game, especially for people who enjoyed the first two Gothic games a long time ago. The thing that speaks to me the most about this title is that you can go to a place that's way above your level to manage, yet you can still try to run through or skill fight the opponents that are much stronger than your character. That paired with the classic Gothic feeling of trying to get inside a specific place, or outside of it, is a very nice feature. For a 2009 game, Risen's graphics are rather pleasing. Truly a game worth recommending, and therefore I recommend it not only to the people who already know the early-Gothic experience, but would also want to experience free roam action RPG games.",

            "review_text": "After losing the Gothic franchise to JoWood, Pyranha Bytes had to start work on a new project and started making what they know best .. an open world RPG. And so Risen made it's way to our hard-drives and consoles. Set in a new world, with a new Nameless Hero the story starts on a ship which is under attack from ... something. You play as one of the survivors, washed up on the shores of a near island. From there on it's up to you ... to save the world obviously.  They seem to have used the same engine (a bit more polished, and it runs much smoother) like Gothic 3 only the island is set in a more tropical environment with thick forests you wouldn't go into. The land is run by three factions and you can choose to join one of them each coming with their pros and cons. You will be welcomed by the monastery for some brain-washing (or so they say ... didn't quite play it the monastery way) and some weed-smuggling, by the Town to keep order or by Don Esteban to retake the town for him. It doesn't quite matter which one you help ... cause, apart for some quests the outcome of it is the same. It is a bit funny how these three factions seem copy/pasted from Gothic 2 ... and maybe Gothic 1 (seeing how one of them lives in the swamp). That might be the major flaw with Risen after all ... it feels too much like the Gothic series ... in many ways ...  The island is much smaller then many of the lands Piranha Bytes has thrown at us ... or at least that's how it felt to me. But despite its size, it's filled with stuff to explore. Caves, ancient structures (some are explorable only after certain quests ...), mountains to climb or levitate from one to another and treasures to dig. About the levitate part I have to mention a big FAIL (not relevant to the review). I went through a cave and reached an exit on the top of a mountain. I could see a heap of gold, a sword and some other things on another mountain. I checked my inventory and saw that I only have 1 levitation spell. I decided to use it to get on the other side see what's there and if it was worth it I'd reload, buy another scroll and come back. Of course the sword was a bit better then mine so I did all mentioned above. Half an hour later with the sword in my hands I levitated back and continued my adventure. Then I realized the painful truth. I could've just teleported from there. Major fail.  Ok, back to the game ... and to the teleporters ... once you get at a certain chapter, some *spoiler* will spawn all over the land and some of them will be carrying teleporter stones. Yes we saw them till now. The thing is .. that there are too many in my opinion. You will get a teleporter stone for almost every road junction there is. Until your first teleport you will have to walk. The view is nice and the things that want to bite your head off are deadly. The fighting system has improved a lot since Gothic 3. At points it might be the same button-mashing ... until your first human opponent. There I learned to block and believe me it is very useful. Also at first you only have a 3-hit max combo (or something of the sort) but if you level up a type of weapon (the one you will use most of the game of course) you will unlock longer combos and special attacks or the ability to wield two-handers with one-hand.  Well, in the end I'll have to say that Risen is a pretty solid RPG that every fan of the genre should play. Although it resembles some of the developers last games in some ways, it still has a unique feeling, great graphics, a awesome atmosphere, some good characters and that feeling of loneliness and fear to go into a forest at night we missed.",
