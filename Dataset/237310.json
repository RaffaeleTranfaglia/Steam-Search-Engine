To be honest, it's not really that great until you hit level 15 and can start your job change. A job change basically means you get more skills, a new look, and better stats. There are, however, both pros and cons to this game which I will also review.   Pros:",

Overall community is great i often talk with random people in town and dungeons but at the same time pvp is the exact opposite which is why in pvp i ignore chat and focus on winning. Fairly easy to gain levels and progress up to level 50 after that it depends if your willingness to sell your soul to the game. Another problem is as for gear that game is very limited unless your a very capable fighter', or u have loads of money to buy item mall gear, or you're online all the time the for the occasional event. in my opinion the game is 7.5/10",

            "review_text": "+Overall- This game is awesome Its a fighting game an a MMO all in one. I personally love playing RF because you punch everything but it has a variety of play styles for everbody for example Deadly Chaser a job class for chung is the Guile of Elsword an Elsword is kinda the Ryu. Not only does it contibute to the fighting Genre of fans but also anime fans because it has that feel but not too much to make both sides even.  +Classes- So basically how it goes is you pick a character instead of a class (like a fighting game) an you proceed to level up the character and once you reach lvl 15 you get your first job change an after you reach 35 I believe you get your 2nd job change which is going to be your character from then on. each character will end up having 3 job classes and each one will be extremely different from the others, I'll use Raven as an example.  -Reckless Fist is basically a character where he can take hits but aslo dish out damage aswell an uses his nasod arm instead of his sword doing high magical damage with super armor most of the time.  -Blade Master focues around using his blade with very fast attacks before his opponent can but is very vulnerable to magical and a little bit to physical but he avoids this by being very mobile.  -Veteran Commander is a cross between ranged and close combat basically a shoto character in a fighting game he isnt very tanky but he has good combos, good mobility and has high damaging specials making him a really dangerous class.  Overall the class system is really good because there is something for everyone, If you like a powerhouse but like to be a little tanky go for Raven, if you like zoneing your oppoenent go Rena or Aisha, You wanna be in the opponents face almost all the time being very mobile and have good reach Ara, You just wanna go on full dmg not caring about defense Add is a good character to do that awell. Overall there is so much variety right now in elsword everyone can find a character.  +Gamplay  Now this is the thing every person in a fighting game cares about and also in MMOs the gameplay.  -PVP right now Elsword has a balanced system after a certain amount of hits a persons KDR(Knock Down Rate) will go up an make them fall ending the combo, but people can work around this and do something called a KD reset where they hit the oppoent in the air most of the time and bring them back down before they fall to the ground allowing them to continue the combo. Now before you think the first hit decides the match, MP (Mana Points) is a resource which everyone has and once you reach a hundred you can hold Light or Heavy attack and Mana Break forcing youself to fall ending the combo but like any other fighting game being on the ground is a big dis-advantage so stay mobile is key in elsword there is no true block button aside from one of Elsword's actives(I mean the character not the game, confusing yes I know). But like most fighting games it comes down to skill who can utilize his kit better then the other player, but like all other PVP games there is something OP once in awhile right now Ara and Elesis are very strong character being very mobile an sometimes having super armor and MAJOR damage moves one example to prove this is that in all big heard tournaments in Elsword usally Ara's always win because one of her jobs is insanley powerful. With the recently added character Add he is probably the most damaging character once he gets his conditions set but he has 0 to none defense being half healthed usally in one combo. But everything is usally patched or buffs are given to other character to balance it out, Elsword does a pretty good job about this so dont judge the game by a few characters.  -PVE This is something Elsword is minorly known for but before you go saying, 'I side scroller? Thats probably so easy!'. You are wrong because in dungens later in the game become really challenging making you follow mechanics so you cant have an easy time. It also has insane raid bosses that have tricky patterns to memorize making it a real challenge, also seasonal raid bossess so you get something new most of the time. I will say that some dungens can be done pretty easy if you got or bought a 'Mount' basically these things only use is for dungens doing insane damage for a set amount of time but it doesnt entirley break the game one because they are expensive and they only have 100 stamina an may only last around 5-6 minutes at a time. Overall Elsword PVP isnt boring because it most of the time comes up with something knew almost every month or so actually quicker then that sometimes, it is in no way easy or boring.  +Graphics  They have simple graphics that look good, its not next gen realistic graphics its just simple but they somehow make it seem really appealing with their character designs and NPC design aswell, then the monsters arent those stupid over anime monsters that you see in other anime MMO RPGs, they actually make wood golems that wear a mask looking like they are hiding a scary face or something, overall this is short and sweet to the point its nothing special but it isnt bad in the slightest way. If you want a comparison go look at Grand Chase compared to this game.  +Final  I am probably skipping some points but this has been written long enough the overall game is good its fair to people who just want to play the game and not spend money in some aspects its a little bit like 'Pay-to-Win' but overall no people buy accesorys to make there character look cool and the buffs they get from them aren't that big so it doesnt make a huge difference, if you dont want to spend money thats fine Elsword gives pleny of oppurtinitys to get accesorys for your character absolutely free for just playing the game. It is in no way a pay to win game. Gameplay is solid most of the time aside from some character being a little OP an some character having unfair moves but I say again it comes down to raw skill...most of the time! PVE is not boring an doesnt lack excitment with over the top bosses like a giant mecha robot with wings that fire giant lasers at you an can back hand you and instant kill you. Graphics are nice and simple also are really well used, this game is awesome at keeping to a fighting game Genre and MMO aswell I recomend that you try it atleast once if your a fighting game fan, get to the 2nd job class get to around 50 and start pvping after you get your gear (which is really easy to get) an start playing, watch some videos of people comboing learn an I gurantee you will have fun.  I forgot to mention so many things in this review but this is basically the meat of it all so if you think this sounds awesome to you go join the community because its growing very slowly each day,",

            "review_text": "An interesting MMO. Sure there are other side-scrolling multiplayer games, like Awesomenauts, but that focuses more on team versus matches. With Elsword you have quality visuals, done in an anime-esque cell shading style, character voices are done in Japanesse (text is in English). What's different here is that the vast majority of the time, you don't need your mouse. All combat is controlled from the keyboard, from movement to attacks and the mouse only seems to be used for menus. Also, this game uses a Stamina system; killing monsters in dungeons uses stamina, the more players running that dungeon, the less you use. Stamina refills daily (3am PST), but is unlimited on weekends, and honestly, you can get at least 3-4 hours of dungeon time in on your daily stamina, so it's not a huge deal.  What can be a bit confusing are the costume pieces from the real-money store. While they're nice and they can make your character look decent, they all seem to be limited-time use items. I may be wrong about that, but when you look at them the price is listed twice, one for a 30-day use and one permanent for 2x the 30-day price. You can get by without them, as they only apply stat boost on top of whatever your getting from armor/weapons/ect.  That aside, the game is highly addictive. However, for most quest you seem to have to repeat dungeons over at least 2-3 times, often at specific difficulty levels or higher, but said dungeons have 3 difficulty levels and you can always just join a random group to take on the highest levels or run solo if you're feeling up to it. Dungeons are also split up, with some not letting you progress till all enemies are dead. One gripe I found was in the Skill Notebook quest where I had to run two dungeons over and over again in order to kill one enemy type because I need to collect 20 items, which were rare drops (I'd get 2-3 per run, max with some runs giving none). But most times you're asked to collect 20+ of an item you get it from every avaliable enemy kill, so it's only a problem in specific quests where the item is listed as Rare.  In-game currency is easy to come by. At only 6 hours in I'd already accumulated over 300k, and probably spent even more upgrading my equipment as well, since you can get a lot of use out of equipment via enchanting, enhancing and repairing before you need to get something new.  I haven't delved too deeply into crafting, but item/weapon enhancement is done two different ways, each adding diffrent things, so the system there is robust enough to allow for customization to play prefferences.  In all it's a solid game with solid mechanics, detailed characters, both NPC and your own. My only real gripe is that unless you pay K-Ching (the games real-world money) you're limited to only 3 item quick-slots and 4 skill quick-slots, you're inventory is also limited, with 8 slot upgrades costing 200 K-Ching. However, 1 K-Ching is ~$.01, so it's not that big a cost (This is based off the 500 K-Ching pack costing $5US). But be warned that such upgrades are bought on a per character basis, so it costs about $14 per character to get +16 inventory spaces and all 8 skill quick slots, but you can play just as well with the stock free setup.",

The game is an MMO but its a small data consumer with just over 3000 MB not GB, that would be your entire life right there. The game gets updates now and then and has stuff you can buy with real money but the games money is insane. First time players see 5,000 coins for an item, but you can get 10 times as much buy going into different areas. Before I end this, the specials are always so cool, and the story is acceptable.",

With 8 characters each with multiple job changes for each to keep combat exciting with more skills added to the skill tree. As the game progresses the dungeons get harder, monsters get stronger and the importance of a team is almost required by level 40+. As a person that has used all of the classes, I can firmly say that each has it's advantages and drawbacks, some more than others of course, but that does with any game. This is not your typical MMO with healer, tank, and DPS. Each character is equally capable of dishing out death and destruction across the 2-d dungeons.",

I will admit that I have put quite a bit of money into Elsword, but that's simply because I love the game and have an addiction to the PVP side of it. However, if you play mostly for dungegon and aren't a PVP type of person, you can surely get by perfectly fine without paying a dime. Putting money into it is all up to you and your preference; I mean, really good equipment sets can be obtained through doing secret dungeons too, and that's always free, just a lot of work.

I know I might be little generous about giving the game that high of a rating,but ♥♥♥♥ it.NA needs to get smarter and better.",

I have been a player of Elsword since it's early days of releasement  way before it was even considered a steam release. I have been playing for all well over a few year's of this game. And i can say alot has changed through out the updates like how chung was added to the game and etc. all that goodness  overall great game just that i stopped playing for various problems Like my premium items that i bought for unlimited time. like no 7 days stuff is all gone. so i got ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and bored at the game.

Unlike the more popular games like WoW, this actually takes skills to play instead of standing around click on skills. You actually have to move and do combos. I will say that the item mall is a little overpriced with the pretty sets you can get from ice burners being expensive, like 40 dollars for a whole set depending on what you are getting. Also the ice burners chance of actually getting something worth while is very low. I think out of 20 burners i used through the entire game i got one good costume piece. The PvP is a bit iffy, i find that a lot of people i go against arent really all that good at Pvp, they just spam the same move over and over and over to do combos which is a bit boring. People also have crappy internet who PvP so they get an advantage by lagging and not be affected by combos and getting away from attacks. But still i recommend you play this game if you like a challenge.",

One of the reasons is not liking the character/class you chose. In order to fully enjoy this game you have to find the character/characters that suits your playing style. Then decide if you want to PVP or PVE or both. At the higher levels of this game it could seem a little bit grindy since you have to repeat dungeons alot. As far as cash shop goes, it's really expensive however, through patience and participating in events you could honestly avoid spending too much money. There's only one thing you have to buy if you go that route. You have to buy a B slot so you can use your other skills. Elsword is quite enjoyable but you have to give it a real try before discrediting it.  Negatives are:  -Half the population doesn't speak english and half the ones who do are immature kids. -Costumes and mounts and decent gear are extremely expensive and game is cash shop drawn, expected though. -Grindier at the higher levels -Not newbie friendly, especially when it comes to terms with skill points and stuff. Since you have to figure out your playing style and what skills you prefer. Guides are nice but everyone has a preference. -Events can seem a bit lame and generic at times.  Positives are:  -Fast paced side scrolling action. It's not a point-and-click game. It's also not too heavily gear based as it is skill based. -Every boss is different and unique. -New content continously -When you do find those special friends, it's totally fun running dungeons, taking screenshots for events, goofing off in the town squares, and showing off your pets and costumes and mounts! -Getting in-game currency isn't hard at all. El shards are always profitable as well as boss drops and your ED from dungeon runs. -Pvp is pretty fun with friends, solo match making is for all the try hards who have something to prove online so I would avoid that because they are usually hardcore and rage alot. -My favorite reason for playing Elsword is my friends, so the best idea is to find good ones!  As for typical ratings here they are!  4/5 For gameplay 4/5 For content [We usually always get new content but it takes a bit longer on NA server] 2/5 For community [Good friends are a jewel and people always come and go] 1/5 For affordability [Cash shop super over priced] 5/5 For customization [Tons of different [cool, cute, and intimidating] pets and even rare ones from events. and characters are pretty unique considering they have 3 different classes which change their stance, pose, and voice not to mention costumes! Mounts were recently released so there aren't many yet!] 2/5 For customer support 3/5 For gamepad support [Better off using custom keys on gamepad]",

B-Slots (allows you to use more skills) are sold in the marketplace in-game along with magic necklaces (increased MP gain). Costumes are also sold on the board in-game, or you could find K-ching sellers for nearly anything else you could want in the cash shop. Now that that's out of the way, the game itself is kind of repetitive, but dungeons do look different and bosses do have different mechanics. Leveling is easy to do offering multiple ways to do it (Dungeons, Fields, Ereda Island). That about covers PvE. PvP is another story. Some classes are god-tier and some are please-put-me-out-of-my-misery tier. Easy characters to use would include Add/Ara/Luciel/Elesis(maybe). Harder to use characters would include Elsword/Aisha (Masochist? Good. This is the char for you.)/Raven. Summed up, this game is pretty cool if you're into the whole 2D Sidescrolling thing.

There are so many characters, classes, skills, dungeons, and more to discover! By the time I have finished playing every single character, class, and gotten to the maximum level, I would no longer be a teenager.  In a more serious note, there are obviously flaws to this game. All games do really. As for this, the main issue people have with this game is the balance between classes. It is understandable. I get it. Many classes are more overpowered than others. Just look at the recent renewals there have been lately. Old classes that were rarely seen before the renewal have been making a comeback because of their new skills, textures, stats, combos, etc.. However, the renewals are pretty cheap. Many of the renewed classes have skills that are constantly spammed. I would also like to include the recent balance patch made in KR. There has been A LOT of talk about it. It is one of the most impactful balance patches I believe.... Many of the overpowered characters are getting nerfed. That is interesting. It'll wreak havoc when the patch comes to NA in several months. PVP will be more balanced I hope.  Yes, the current balances are quite an issue in PVP, but there is so much more to the game than that. Events, Henir, Secret Dungeons, Field, Raid Bosses.... There is so much more to do. Whether a player is stronger than another does not apply to those. You can still have fun. You can have fun exploring skills and combos and getting to know each individual class. You can have fun meeting the community (outside the salty Arena ofc) and make friends and join guilds.  There is also the arguable fact about the phrase 'Pay to win.' Now, I do admit, I have spent A LOT in this game. That is only because I see myself playing this a lot, so I invest money into it. I do not pay to win. I more pay to make the experience of playing the game more enjoyable. Yeah, a skill B-Slot takes a big role in playing the game, but I feel like it could also be taken as a challenge. Not investing any money into a game is quite a challenge. I would admire anyone who could truly know the game without having to pay once. Luckily, Elsword has something called a board where you can not only sell craftable items and consumables, but you can sell items that come from the Item Mall where you could only use real money. On the board, people could use ED to buy those items, free of any real life charge. Yeah, it takes long to farm for that ED, but if you invest enough time into the game, it should not be a big deal.",

You have a variety of characters to choose from and each comes with their own abilities and difficulty style. The game is really fun to play and can immerse you for many hours while you level up, select your skills and make them more powerful using skill points. The game does have an item mall where you can spend real money converted into K-Ching to get special items, class upgrades, costumes with stats that increase as you level up. The down side to the item mall is that you have to choose if you want the items you purchase from there to be permanent or temporary (idk why you want a trial run of the item but I know some people do for some reason. My opinion is get the items you want as a permanent keeper). The story is quite good and entertaining with cutscene's and intro that actually shows you how to start off. Anyone wanting to play a side scrolling rpg this is the game for you. I hope you enjoy playing the game or will join the game and start your own adventure.

Levelling doesn't feel grindy at most parts partly due to the fact that every dungeon is easy at all difficulties so just pick a very hard dungeon and get tens of thousands of exp in a single run.  Community wise (which I have always search in an MMO because that's what MMOs is for) is scant, non-existant, and more guild based. Trying to start a conversation with the public masses is quite hard, due to zombies in the community elsword is a quiet MMO.  The final verdict: much to my disappointment to the elsword community, they keep players entertained with faced paced combat and very cute npc voices.

One downer about the married feature, is that it costs 380000000 gold to break up, and you cant delete your character, with a married statis. I had a horrible breakup with my ex, and cant get rid of it. and its a constent reminder, because I cant delete it. thats the only think I Really wish they could change.

            "review_text": "Hello, this is my first time reviewing a game, so exciting. Let's start:  Elsword is a game that I've been a fan of and played for years. For a platform-side scroller, elsword to me is an amazing game. However, like all games, it has its flaws.  Cons: The pve in elsword can be fun and exciting except the for some quests given to you in game makes you do certain dungeons over and over again. Add in the fact that for quests that require you to get certain items, you don't get the item (or any of the required items) every time you do the dungeon, making pve to be annoyingly repetitive at times.  Also, unlike in the past, players are no longer able to get all the skills available for their chosen character. Now, if you want to be able to try out all of your character's skills, you have to either A) have skill resets or B) pay real money to buy 2 skill trees or C) make multiple accounts.  Pros: The item shop in elsword has reasonable prices. The pvp is never repetitive and highly engaging and requires an immense amount of skill in order to become a higher rank. Despite having repetitive moments, the PvE in elsword has interesting enemies and very interesting bosses that can be challenging. Despite being restricted from obtaining all or your character's skills, you still have a lot of skills that are allowed for you to use, and the skills are very diverse along with a touch of badassery. The game has events quite often that give players special items for free. The plot for each character is different (background stories and motives i mean). You're allowed for up to 9 characters per account and there are 27 classes so far to choose from!   To sum this all up, Elsword in spite of its flaws is an amazing game that i would recommend to anyone who's interested in skilled pvp and fast pace gameplay.",

When i first joined i had no idea how to do anything ( i didnt even know how job's worked). After all these years there is just something that pulls me back every month that makes me finish new character job changes. If you dont like rpg's than there is a change you probably wont like elsword. Elsword isnt as pay to play as people make it seem, but there are some things that do need you to pay for if you want to go 'pro', whatever that means. All in all elsword is a really good game and you should give it a try.",

            "review_text": "This game made me hate the now typical practice in not only 'Free to Play' games, but in most MMO's in general.  I looked into this game a couple of years ago because I wanted something simple and easy to jump in/jump out whenever I wanted to 'play' a game but not really play a game. You know, do something to kill time until other obligations spring up or if I can't decide what other game I want to play instead. I treated this game as a snack; something to enjoy in the meantime before the real meal comes up. At first I was pretty happy. It was nice, colorful, and simple. And despite the atrociously generic characters (little girl with a big sword, little loli mage, blonde haired elf archer, etc), I still enjoyed playing with them for a while. And then it hit me like an angry flaming brick wall; You're not allowed to even have simple fun unless you're willing to shell out the cash. 'It's free to play!', you exclaim. 'Of course they'll charge you for SOMETHING.' Fair enough. But I shouldn't have to pay money out for an extra skill slot. Little things the game throws at me shouldn't require extra cash when I never wanted the item in the first place. And all the base, free costumes are incredibly ugly... which is to incentivize players into paying more money for their costumes. And on that note; the Pay to Win. If ANYONE tells you that isn't true just know that they're lying. Those stat increases are insane! It doesn't matter how well you are at the game because little Johnny Morebucks can buy an insta-kill weapon and BOOM! You're dead. No glory, no skill. Just a whiny kid with his daddy's money.  Typically I wouldn't mind handing over a few bucks for a neat costume. But this is insane. The stuff you can buy with real cash are incredibly overpriced and needlessly over-powered for no adequately explained reason. And after a certain point it's almost as if the game expects you to start throwing money away just so you can progress. That's insane.  Games like this are an embarrassment. If you want to make a Free to Play game, then go for it. You want to charge a little for a neat outfit or an accessory? By all means. But don't charge $40+ for a single complete outfit and then jack up the buffs to where you become unto a God. I know what it means to have fun; it means to feel as though you've accomplished something. That YOU became powerful on your OWN merits. Not by buying it.  And this all doesn't even address the grind. Dear god almighty the grind. 'Oh, an MMO that makes you grind? How absurd!' I know, this isn't anything new to MMO's. But this makes a grind and turns it into a tedious, required chore where the end never comes into view. It's just over and over whacking the same bland enemies with the same bland backdrop with the same obnoxiously bland sound effects to the track of some bland, forgettable pseuo-electro pop nonesense.  I'm also ignoring the whole 'weeaboo' thing but... hey, it's Elsword. Young anime girl with unnatural hair weilding a big sword. What did you expect?  No, I don't reccommend this game. It should be pushed aside. This sort of practice should not be encouraged. And I don't care how much money you borrow from your family/friends, or how much you earn to justify spending it on this. You're paying for numbers and pixel clothes. That's depressing.",

            "review_text": "FULL Warning, if someone is planning to read this, be aware this is a long review. Elsword is game that is, like a lot of games nowadays, a game i call 'Junk Food', is good, very good, but only for a while. The Story is simple, nothing mind-blowing, this is both a con and a pro. Since it is simple in generic terms, is nothing special and for so, it doesn't stick out from other games. On the contrary, this eases the player getting into it and makes it easy to understand and value, still i will say this is a case where the plot is maybe... too simple... The aesthetics and visuals are most impressive, in this point in time, nigh-every game is out to look edgy and serious, for so, making Elsword all the more special with its unique anime style artwork and graphics. The characters models, on the other hand are... Meh, driven by their artwork, i was expecting a much more cleaner and precise model, the models look nowhere near as good or detailed as the artworks and at first it bothered the hell outta me, i will say i like almost all of the suits for nearly everyone, but i wish Job Change clothes didn't expire, smart people will see is a cheap way of the developers saying 'Want to look good again? Load up money and buy some sh¡t'. I will not sh¡t on the cloth clipping visual effects when you are wearing too much junk over since a lot of other games also have this issue, plus the fact that is not really a big deal and it doesn't have any relevant impact besides being glaring... Gameplay-wise, i will say Elsword has a very interesting concept and it pulls it off rather well, entering dungeons and combo-ing the sh¡t out of everything that is in the path along with visually impressive attack and a good amount of skills to dish out great amounts of pain without letting your enemies breathe is very satisfying and rewarding... When you learn to get those skills. Blazing through dungeons is very fun and appropiated party combo is a very cool thing to do, however if you are a person who gets dissoriented easily you might find yourself losing track of yourself and your actions due to the amount of shines, effects and explosions on the screen, which admittedly can become very annoying for some people. PvP, on the other hand, has to be the weakest part of the game for me, and i can say for nigh-everybody, the more they attempt to fix things, the more they ♥♥♥♥ up, not to mention that, if you have spent a good amount of hours in this game, getting to know the game as much as you could, the unbalance in PvP and how broken it is becomes more evident the more you level up and face people. Leveling up increases base stats like HP, Phy Atk/Def and Mag Atk/Def, also after certain level thresholds, you will be able to learn more skills that do increase your might and power to badazz proportions. In PvP however... Lets run down a list from the less impacting to the most obvious and annoying. 1. Crappy Matchmaking System: I know everyone who has spent some decent hours in PvP did experience being like Lvl 30 and you are put to brawl agaisnt a Lvl 45 ~ 70, also when, since the PvP is Rank based (Standard stuff, the more you win matches, the more you Rank up), a beginner of Rank B can be placed to fight agaisnt a Rank A or S, it doesn't impact as much as the Lvl gap matches, but is still a very r3tard3d system. 2. LAAAAAAG: Some say the Lag issues were probably inevitable, and to that i say bullsh¡t, i've played many games in which having a below-average internet didn't impacted much on the game itself and didn't made the experience completely suck balls, when you are PvPing (1v1, 2v2 or 3v3) and someone has lag, beating that son/daughter of a b¡tch just became a whole lot harder, in 1v1 the most annoying since if someone has lag, you will be unable to engage the foe in a combo since, you land the hit, but the damage and the flinch is inflicted after a period of time, making the entire concept of the game to be completely shot in the azz. This also applies to instances in PvP 2v2 ~ 3v3 where someone would activate Awakening or use a Special Active that causes Skill Freeze (Everyone in the Skill Freeze reach is immobile and unable to take action until hit or Skill Freeze ends), they are not affected or instances where the Skill Freeze is canceled by someone else who used another move that Skill Freezes, is hard to explain, but get to Lvl 70 and enter 2v2 SS Ranks matches and see for yourself. 3: Character Disbalance: This, same as the issue with PvP Lag, becomes more apparent the more you progress and face players at higher levels, certain classes are CLEARLY better than others, being for mobility, damage, coverage or all of the above, this is even more obvious when you look at classes like LK, RS and IS and then you look at classes like LP and MM, and even if the previously issues are not present, some classes are just a cakewalk to use: EM: All she needs to do is XZZ or just keep running away and use Meditation or just stay still and camp MP, Some EMs may say 'Duuude, we need a lot of MP to attack', and i say, once again, BULL. SH¡T. The moment you get MP, you use the MP, but you get a lot of MP, since EM has the biggest MP gain by attacks and almost all her attacks provide a great MP gain. Rena Classes: ♥♥♥♥ them all, To start, all of them noob Renas just spam ^X or ^^X to catch since is fast and has good coverage, don't be surprised if you are caught repeatedly by those noob Renas that just wait for you to approach them and ^X is the only thing they know to do, then there is what i consider to be the biggest ♥♥♥♥ing bummer after Add, RENA'S AND AISHA'S TUMBLING. This abomination of a feature makes it a death-wish to throw Renas or Aisha into the air and hit them while airborne, if you do, they do a flip and as soon as they land, they can jump again, unlike all other characters that after landing, have a slight delay before being able to move, making it very easy for them to cassually hop out of your combos and back-firing you. ADDISON: This MOFO is the epidemy of Aimbot, almost all of his moves cover a good area, any commands he has are so easily spammable that a one-handed fetus with mental problems would be able to combo and nigh all of his moves are homing. He was made with the sh¡ttiest HP output, but you know that doesn't mean a damn when you can't even get close to touching him since he always has the screen bombarded with homing moves. 4 and most important. Gear Difference: You can be the best of your kind, the number one as your class, however you face a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that has a cutting-edge gear and wrecks you over in just a few single hits, Gear Carry is without a doubt the biggest ♥♥♥♥ing problem of balance that helps unbalancing the already unbalanced PvP. Costume Parts, Costume Suits, Magic Amulets, Magic Stones, all of those, 90% requiring you to waste real-life money to get easily, these parts do build up a good chunk of your battle stats, and just with that gear boost, a completely ♥♥♥♥ing noob and idiotic player can pot shot a pro player effortlessly by just having the gear advantage, this becomes much more frecuent when you are on your road to SS and SSS, you will find players with absurd stats that with landing 15 hits on you is enough to take you down while you will have to strike them like a sewing machine to get remotely close to depleting a small slice of their HP. In the now PvP Season 3, the gear advantage is even more apparent as it can make playing serious PvP SERIOUSLY UNBEARABLE, More so when you are constantly being placed to fight agaisnt the same exact gear carried douch3bags who have obnoxiously strong gear sets, Even more so when they behave all mighty just because they have the gear upper-hand. Music: No need since music is subjective.  END VEREDICT: As i said in the beggining of this review, this is JunkFood game, play it until you get to Level cap and had enough fun with PvP, then uninstall and change to another game.",

Don't expect anything more demanding than Z+Z+Z+Z+X.  - Graphics. Full 3D should be a good thing, right? Nope. Especially when you see the same low-poly 'Bob The Builder' blocks being copy-pasted from dungeon to dungeon.   - Deisign. Outfits should be an incredibly tempting 'must-buy' because of how good they look. In Elsword, most outfits consist of White, Black, and an 'Accent'. Or worse: PlayBunny, Demon, Angel, Oriental.   - Sounds. I had to turn this off. Battle should consist of the sound of metal colliding and wood breaking...not whoopie cushions being let loose in a vat of butter.   - Music. I certainly don't remember any of it, so I went on Youtube and listened to the tracks. None of them have a 'wow' factor...and they almost feel copy-pasted.   - PvE. Pretty boring and really to easy to max out. There really isn't that much challenge out there. As I typed this, I even forgot it was playing in the background...wow.  - PvP. Hope you spent money if you actually want to win. With regenerating MP, talent can only get you through so much before you end up stun locked or one shotted. Especially when LuCiel gets their 2nd job...  - World HUB. This really bothers me because it feels like they're just trying to stretch out the gameplay as well as give you some reason to purchase a Mount. A Mount in a sidescroller. Think about it: $. You can also spend $ traveling from HUB to HUB. Even more bothersome, the World Map is accessible anywhere...so why aren't the two of them tied together instead of being weird seperate entitites?  Honestly, Grand Chase S2 was as good as this genre was going to get. Elsword is your typical Korean MMO: No originality, hand holding grind, and a constant squeeze for cash and ideas from the community. If you go into Elsword and find yourself thinking that this experiance could be better, then go hunt down a Grand Chase private server. FGC.   Obviously, I'm bitter because KOG failed to improve upon Grand Chase because they wanted to focus on Elsword.",

Buying things with in game money are basically pointless except for a variety of accessories, because by the time you get up to the level where you can use the weapon you can buy, you don't even need to buy it anymore.  There are 2 upsides to this game though, the combat, and the characters. The combat is a hack and slash button mashing of z &amp; x. Although, over a long period of time, the combat starts getting boring, knowing the only time you get more combat moves is when you get your class change, I am going to rate the combat a 6/10.   Each character has their own story, weapons, and combat style, but some of the different characters have the same class change stats, which imo, is kinda lame, but like i said, they all have their own combat style.  The maps in the game start to get redundant and lack imagination, because some of their maps are the same, but flipped, or with a different climate and time.  I think the thing I hate most about this game is the stamina, you have stamina on every character, and when its empty, you can't do any dungeon quests and you have to wait until 3:00am to play again, which makes you think that the creators don't want you to play the game.   My rating for this game is a 6/10. I do reccomend to people who are new to PC gaming. Its still fun at time and i would continue playing it because they are always adding new items and characters that get enjoyable.   ",

The economy thankfully deflated sometime ago and Ice Burner sets are easier to obtain compared to how they were back then.  Now here's the problem with Elsword.  PvP is STILL unbalanced. Winning/Losing a match is usually decided in this order: Gear &gt; Class &gt; Actual Skill. I find this odd since Ereda Island actually normalizes damage, so why is PvP not like this?  I still like Elsword, but I'm going to give this game a negative review since there's no mixed reccomendation on Steam. The community is also something to take in account, which I have mixed feelings about. The community had changed so much from when I started back in 2013 that I can't help but feel saddened over it.

            "review_text": "Alright, i finnaly have a max lvl character and ive spent enough time in this game to write a worthwhile review. Ill split my review in 2 parts; PVP and PVE, Aka. Players versus players and Player versus enemies (dongeons), which are the 2 parts of the experience this game as to offer. --------------------------------------- Lets start with PVE. PVE consist of a set of dongeons, you go to the dongeon corresponding to your level, get some quests done, kill some bosses, nothing really ground breaking. The part that i hate about PVE in this game is that its REALLY REALLY easy, your party will just steam roll everything even on hard difficulty, later it gets more challanging but thats 100h into the game (if you make it that far) and even then its repetitive as hell anyway. TL;DR PVE is easy, grindy and boring --------------------------------------- Now for PVP. PVP is quite simple, you go in 1v1 2v2 or 3v3 and try to kill the enemy, nothing fancy or complex going on here, you kill people, which is totally fine, not all games need 12 pvp modes. But it gets ugly rather quickly, heres a list of whats wrong with pvp: 1: The ranked system is based of your total win rate and ignore your level totally so having a lvl 40 face a lvl 70 happens really often and of course the lvl 40 gets pummeled. 2: PVP is pay2win, not by a lot, but still is, let me explain. You are limited to 4 skills at all times, however you can pay 10$ to unlock a second skillset and have 8 instead, effectively giving you twice the flexibility in combat. If you want to go far in PVP you better have dat 10 bucks. 3: Random items, there are some random items that spawn in the pvp arena which grants various buffs and bonuses, theres no problem here so far. The problem arise that you cant turn them off in RANKED pvp. Adding a element of randomness to a RANKED match is just rage inducing to say the least. 4: Lag, nothing much to say here, it lag and that sucks. 5: Balance issues; Some classes are just flat out broken and little is done in order to balance them. TL:DR PVP is pay2win, laggy and unbalanced.",

Extra item slots, extra skill slots, the coupling mechanic, costumes, etc. This game can be played without spending a dime, but asks you BUY THIS TO UNLOCK THAT everywhere.   The environment design is also a bit of a clusterf&amp;ck and can give you eyestrain. Bright color palette and busy advertisments littered everywhere TO BUY THIS NEW PACK, coupled with 20 players bouncing around on screen makes it overall visually chaotic.   Perhaps most insulting thing in this game is how it dangles cool features to new comers that have expiration dates on them. I picked Elesis because of her cute battle dress design only to come back a week later to realize it had been stripped away because of the expiration date. OF COURSE I could reaquire it by SPENDING MONEY. Yet, there is a way to aquire currency without spending money by TAKING SURVEYS! Even the 'legit' free surveys sponsored by the developers is like throwing time and effort down a rathole, so much that you'll want to spend money to spite them. But I digress. In short, like pretty much all free to play games, Elsword has many ways to try and get one's money, but money isnt really necessary to play and enjoy it.   The story is almost negligible. Some sprites pop up and talk about some bandits in a forest or some dragon in a cave.. meh I didnt care. It does not present the story in an interesting way at all. No cinematics. No incenstive to care at all about any kind of narrative.  But the positive I can is that it is 2D and fairly simple to progress and level up. The community is pretty friendly too. Once you gain your skills and a strong enough weapon, it can get addictive. Also the music is quite catchy. Found myself humming it for a while. The quality of the music feels somewhat un matching to the quality of the game.  My verdict: Its casual enough to pick and waste some time in if you like being a cute chibi character, but if you are looking for some intense gameplay or interesting strats, just move on to something else.",

You're a game that has fantastic pve, artwork, characters, combat, level design... but for game devs who are surged with an energy for more money ultimately pave the way to their own games demise. You got the looks, you've got the talk, you've got the walk, it's too bad you don't got the respect though. If I seem like an entitled jerk who thinks every game dev owes him something, you're wrong. Nobody owes me anything, nor do I squeeze game devs to make a game beyond their creative limits. All I want from a game, is for it to be good. And this game IS good. What kills it though, is how the devs implement...   Microtransactions...   They go too far here. Not only does it annoy you to no end, but it also limits you to play the game proper. Say for example, you just became a Lord Knight. You just got your new outfit, YOUR new outfit. Now you'd expect that, maybe because you worked so hard that you'd at least keep what you have permanently right? WRONG. You have a minimum of 2 weeks on your new outfit. Wanna know why? Because they want to PREY on your need for customization which this game DESPERATELY needs. So once they've destroyed your pride and you give in to buying stupid outfits, they've won. For them, mission accomplished. You became their    female dog.    Now if that wasn't bad enough, how does a stamina bar sound? Once that bar runs out, no more playing for you. Why? Because it is needed to access dungeons in this game. Dungeon farming is this games rite of passage. It never differs from this formula. PVP is a joke, unblanced and un-fun. I can't think of anything else this game has to talk about. If you want to play in a manga style game, play MapleStory. If you want to get your anime fix, play Sepia Tears for instance, or something else you may come across. This game ain't worth it. And neither are it's costumes.

'It's a free to play game why would you spend money on it?' That's because you can buy certian equipment from the Cash Store that gives you boosts in stats.  This gives people many advantages in PVP as people who are willing to pay can just wreck others who don't have the stat boosts from the in game purchases. Now, PVP. Before you do PVP you will want to learn combos as if you knock down your opponent you cannot damage them but here is the thing. There are certian classes (Wind Sneaker I'm looking at you) who can just spam the EXACT SAME THING OVER AND OVER.  This means you are prone to massive damage while you just sit there, spamming all of your motion keys, trying to move the ♥♥♥♥ out of the way. 'But you can mana break to get out of it.' Yes, you can mana break but that requires (you guessed it) mana to use and that is one of your most dependant source for tons of damage during PVP. Also the matching in PVP is stupid. Right now I'm a lv 52 Yama Raja, expecting a challenge in PVP. Nope. I get paired against lv 15 - 30 people. But, even though I get paired against them, there are certian classes that just dominate the arena, here are some examples: Crimson Avenger Diabolical Esper (and all of Add's classes for christ's sake he's just OP in general) Asura Wind Sneaker Deadly Chaser If you get stuck in one of their combos  YOU ARE DEAD  Just mana break ♥♥♥♥ YOU I will admit, I do enjoy this game to a certian extent, but it requires a LOT of grinding to get the best items. Did I mention how much you have to grind? You have to grind alot. For example, with Yama Raja's. You need to kill this one boss 4 times. And another one 3 times. And those stages are looooooooooooooooooong. Then, after that, you need to collect 100 drops from this group of monster. 'That isn't hard just kill 100 of them.' They don't even drop 100% of the time... In short, this game is unbalanced in some aspects and you have to either: 1. Grind to get good items 2. Buy good items Which one do you think is easier?",

The cost of a permanent outfit is at least $20-$30 dollars, and its only per character.   Save yourself the time and find another game.",

Don't be mistaken by hours played. I played this game outside of steam.  PROS  Character classes are unique = my fav was Paladin capable class 'CHUNG'  Combos are kind of fun.  Quests at first are fun and easy to get some ok gear.  Store has some nice looking skins  Cool visuals    CONS  Grinding fest once higher levels becomes a bit taxing and not worth it.  Combos in this fashion are a bit outdated.  Quests are repititive and maps are same maps as before just different colors and maybe 1-2 unique changes, but otherwise the same. Boring factor 7/10 at minimum.  The DEVS and Support do not back their products. Out of myself and a dozen other friends 10 of us out of 13 had purchasing issues ....currency not showing up, items NOT in queue = once you buy the currency = auto bought all items and it's supposed to prompt for confirmation, even a couple instances of buying one thing and recieving something else and quite a few other store bugs, BUT WHAT IS WORSE IS THEY DO NOT REFUND THEIR ERRORS. Unless you fight through paypal you have no chance of refund. Unless of course you pay your bank fees or Credit card fees to cancel payment.  Game for the most part runs smoothly and I never lagged hardly ever, but when it does it's the worst ever!  Lack of real fixes to the game that are needed  New content looks like things prviously just different colors and 1-2 unique adds  END GAME = pretty boring, uneventful and quick to complete  Game needs more content    All in all I give it about a 4/10 ...if they make it to where it plays as well with a Keboard s it is with a Controller = 5/10 ...if game mechanics fix = 6/10  ...I had fun, but it lasted only for a brief time = MORE CONTENT",

This is absolutely inexcusable and totally ridiculous. Where do you get off as a publisher thinking this is okay? Aeria games, you are a disgrace to honest game publishers and developers everywhere. It's disgusting that publishers like you still exist in these modern times that still exploit players and then shed a blanket of ignorance over yourselves. These are YOUR games, these are YOUR responsibility! If something happens with an account do you not think it would be wise to notify the player of the problem, and then maybe I don't know, STOP taking their money? Where does it make sense to decide that you no longer want a player in your community but it's still okay for said player to continue making payments to your asinine company and you continue to profit? What service are you exactly providing to that individual? Or are you just so godly that you think you deserve recompense for some imagined slight? You are disgusting and I will make sure to notify everyone and anyone of your underhanded tactics and exploitations of your playerbase. Thank you Aeria Games for being a shining example of everything wrong with the gaming world and FTP companies today. Thank you for setting back the evolution of the FTP model, and not progressing towards a more streamlined and player friendly model. May god have mercy on your despicable souls...  I'm out.

But when you start getting farther, progressing becomes more of a chore to the point you have to actually replay dungeons you've already beaten on a higher difficulty just 'cause the story says so.

Now When I say it's repetitive, I mean that the storyline is practically the same for ALL characters, I'll admit the gameplay is slightly different for some characters, And the job changes offer a small bit of interest for all of five minutes. But overall the gameplay becomes repetitive, The quests are just meh, And quite frankly the 'pay to have op stuff' tactic is ♥♥♥♥ poor design.  TLDR: The gameplay is repetitive, The quests are repetitive, The characters don't feel different enough. And don't get me started on the in game real money shop.   I appreciate that the devs put a lot of time into this but quite frankly I don't care for it.   This game rates at 3.2/10 from me, And even that I feel is too generous.",

The gameplay is neat, I'll give credit for that. PvP, however, is a little stupid, so don't try it out. It's a good game, but it's not that great. It gives me mixed feelings that I'm playing this game from time to time, just to test the grind, and I admit it's alright, cause of the 'anime' playstyle. The community is a little... off. I won't give the harsh word that implies to those 'people' out there is just silly in general. The stupid kind of silly. Basically, it's as if the game was meant for kids. Another thing, is that the game is head-on P2P or, P2W, however you want to put it. 10 bucks for another skillslot (to put in an extra four skills), now that's value that KOG Games want you to spend on. Of course, you can still run four skills by playing F2P, but you just won't have much diversity when you play a class. The reason I'm playing this is because of the nostalgia four years ago when I first played this game. It was like Grand Chase, but it wasn't at the same time. I'm still playing it to achieve the max level and then just bust out of the game if I ever get bored. Other than that, that's all to report really. The game's not recommended, but if you want to give it a try, no one's there to stop you.",
