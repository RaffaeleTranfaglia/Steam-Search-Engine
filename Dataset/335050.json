Pros -Cool concept  Cons -Grammatical errors throughout -Looks like something straight out of the 90s -Events for individual cities are limited and incorrect -Crashes often -Those grammatical errors could quite possibly be killing me.  This is obviously a low-budget game and is not worth the money. With that being said, if the devs update to fix errors and add things it may change my mind.",
