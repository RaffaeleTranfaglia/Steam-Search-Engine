            "review_text": "Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel is the follow up to Borderlands 2 and fallows on the rise of Handsome Jack. But will you want to play it ?  Borderlands TPS takes place after the events of Borderlands and before the events of Borderlands 2 and follows on four new vault hunters. Athena, Wilhelm, Nisha and Claptrap get a message from a hyperion worker who happens to be Handsome Jack. After the Dahl soldiers take over the space station they try to destroy the moon of Elpis and it's up to you to stop them.  Gameplay is identical to Borderlands 2. The only new thing is the new Oxygen system. You have a bar which starts to drain when you are outside the oxygen field for too long. Then you start to suffocate. You can also use the double jump to get on higher platforms. You can avoid the oxygen system by picking Claptrap as your character. The new abilities are awesome and all of them are very fun to use.  Graphics are stunning as ever. They look awesome and all the colors are very nice to look at. The textures are kind of mediocre and some of the character models look very bad. Overall the game looks great apart from minor flaws.  Audio is pretty bad. The game's audio for me stopped during firefights and I couldn't hear anything the characters would say to me and sometimes the Echo Com screen didn't transfer the dialogue and I couldn't hear anything which wasn't a problem in Borderlands 2. The soundtrack is alright, there are some great songs but a lot of them are kind of mediocre.  The game is pretty easy for the most part until the final chapter where there is a massive difficulty spike and the final boss solo is incredibly hard. The boss fights are very team oriented meaning the game expected you to play with people from the start.   Level Design in some parts is abysmal it took me massive amounts of understanding where my objective was and where the side quest start. This by far the worst level design in a borderlands game.  The game took me 22 hours to complete every quest and to get to level 27. The game like other Borderlands games has tons of replay value with different vault hunter modes and trying out other characters and of course not to mention the DLC which I will have to check out one day.  The game is pretty stable from the most part. There where some parts where the game wouldn't open a certain door to progress through a quest but a quick reload always fixed the problem.  Overall this game is not as good as the other titles in the series and without a doubt not worth it at the full price. I am a massive Borderlands fan and Pre Ordered this game once I saw it and I can safely say it wasn't a bad game but it's not as good as the other Borderlands games. For other people only buy this on a sale. It has a lot of horrible side quests but this is an overall good game and I highly suggest you to check it out on a sale. I give Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel a 7/10  For more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page  here  - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!",

            "review_text": "It's fun, but not quite as fun as Borderlands 2.   The story is a bit weak, the NPCs are a little flat, and the humor feels meh. I'm just guessing here, but a lot of it is because 2k Australia created it. They went heavy handed trying to infuse the game with Aussie-ness. Pickle, one of the NPCs, feels like such a terrible caricature. Cor! Blimey! He's one step away from Crocodile Dundee. (Edit: Scratch that. Apparently it's a Cockney accent. Still a bit much either way.) And sadly, because we're in space, incendiary just doesn't feel useful anymore. Some of the mechanics are terrible too. Trying to jump some of the gaps require more precision than necessary. And Deadlift, the second boss, is a lot tougher than he should be.   So why am I recommending the game? Because all the playable characters are well built. I've played everyone, including the expansion characters, save for Claptrap and loved each of their skill trees. In BL2, I didn't care much for Salavdor, Zer0, Gaige or Krieg. But the PS skills are nailing it. Also, cryo as an element is an awesome replacement for slag, which really only worked in teamplay anyway. And while jumping/boosting feels a little gimmicky, it's still fun to float around and bring down a butt-slam.  In short, as part of the series, it's a bit of a letdown. But if you can overlook that and pretend it's a one-off, it's still fun. Here's looking forward to Borderlands 3.",

            "review_text": "This game is really good.  A new hud and new visuals doesn't make a game, content does. And this game has a ton of content.  First of all, let me start with one thing. This game is surprsingly DARK compared to the last two Borderlands games. Prepare your morality.  Now that that's done, let's carry on.  PROS  +Borderlands The Pre-Sequel does not disappoint. I have to admit, at first I was super worried about dying of oxygen loss, but the devs were able to make it so losing your oxygen doesn't really make you worry. Oxygen is every where, and if you DO run out, your health depleted at around less than 1% per second, so it isn't a threat to you at all.  +The low gravity also helps a lot. The use of buttslams makes it more fun to flank enemies, and makes the combat even more fast-paced. Slams also work in places with oxygen, as long as the area doesn't have aritifcial gravity. This also helps for easy second winds. If you were to jump accross the area, and get shot down, chances are you'll land right close to another bunch of enemies. This gives you an indirect and accidental edge against enemies, which is also good. Additonally, certain oz-kits can make your low-g experience more fun and fluid, I personally use the air control ones.  +Now about lasers, one of the most advertised parts of the game. Let me put this straight, they're awesome, and really powerful. They also act as psuedo-gun types for each brand. You want Dahl Shotguns back? Have A LASER ONE THAT FIRES AROUND 3 LASER BOLTS PER SECOND. There are also different types such as the railguns, beams, and repeaters, but different manufacturers can give each weapon type an edge due to their special attributes.  +Cryo weapons are also fun, and not just in the visual kind of appeal. It's more tactical than slag. Slag was just like 'shoot enemies with this and then hit them with this'. It even stole corossion's power, which made it even crappier. But cryo is super fun to use. The simple charm of butt stomping a single enemy ( EVEN MORE FUN WITH A TEAM) just puts a smile on my face.  Also, A LOT OF unique weapons with red text can compete with legendary weapons. Like AN EXPLOSIVE JAKOBS SHOTGUN.  Now we have the CONS. Every game has them.  -Let's start with a really annoying one, the checkpoints aren't kind. The maps are bigger for verticality purposes, but some checkpoints can be too far enough that they end up stingy and unforgiving.   -Next, the vehicles. While the stingray is a pretty fun vehicle to use, I can't help but feel disappointed in the lack of variety. The moon buggy is okay at best, although it's more of the same with classic Borderlands vehicles.  -Nisha's whip is terrible, unless you get the Law and Order skill tree capstone. Don't expect to melee a lot with her.  -The side missions are the same with past missions, where you have to go and kill the thing while getting the other thing. Personally, I don't mind this since Pre-Sequel has the best combat in a Borderlands game so far, but other people might not.  ...Overall, Borderlands TPS is a great time. Unless your emotions will get the better of you SINCE THIS GAME IS PRETTY DARK.  An 8 out of 10.",

            "review_text": "A big step backwards for the Borderlands franchise. While a few things were quite well done, particularly class design, bugs were a much bigger problem than in previous installments of the series, and gameplay suffered in multiple ways. Side quests were badly written and often tiresome, attention to making them feel cohesive was lacking, and boss fights were the worst in the series, with the possible exception of the final boss. Both previous Borderlands games, I finished, did my second playthrough, and jumped on the campaign DLCs. In the case of Pre-Sequel, I had to force myself to finish it, and I'm not sure if I want to get DLC in the hopes that it'll be better than the base game, or just buy Tales from the Borderlands, to make clear to Gearbox that my fondness for the franchise is intact, but that shoddy work won't be rewarded.",

In addition, they intend to sell DLC on top of this DLC, making it a clear cash cow. Perhaps it would be worth the money if this future DLC were a part of the package, but it is not.  Several issues from Borderlands 2 are addressed, others left as-is, and new issue are introduced. The content is nice, but not terribly deep --- similar to the Torgue or Tiny Tina DLCs. The maps are, franky, proorly organised and oftentimes frustratingly buggy, with invisible walls more prevalent than past Borderlands experiences. The side-quests are also horridly arranged, often having to reclear an area to get the mission, return to a second area you need to reclear to undertake the mission, then back fo the first location to, yup, reclear it again to turn in the mission!  Cryo replacing Slag makes for a more interesting mechanic and Lasers are an interesting new weapon, though I could take or leave them personally. The new vault hunters are interesting and seem well designed. The plot fills a few gaps from Borderlands 2 and has a few laughs, though the humour is definitely worse than Borderlands 2. The voice acting makes refernce to different Australian and English peoples, though most gamers will not get these references and many will find the dialogue incomprehensible.",

Besides like, 4 legendary guns, cryo, lasers and low grav, nothing new was added that i could see. All but 4 or so legendaries have been copy pasted or renamed and reskined, oxygen isnt even a problem in this game considering you suffocate so god damn slowly, characters are bland, (aside from athena imo) skills are un interesting and a lot of the characters are just plain annoying. Janey and Pickle are the biggest offenders imo.   Is it a bad game? No. Does it feel like a rushed game to meet the crying needs of fans? Oh hell yes. Is it worth the price tag?

            "review_text": "  -Quick Review-   Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel is FPS RPG developed by 2K Australia and Gearbox Software, and released in 2014. Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel is pretty much Borderlands 2 but on the moon/station seen over Pandora. If you're not sure if you'll like borderlands: The Pre-Sequel, go give Borderlands 2 a try.    -Detailed breakdown review-    Story:  Borderlands: The Pre-sequel takes place between the first Borderlands game and Borderlands 2. If you couldn't figure that out for yourself based on the colorful word-play.  (Is a Pre-Sequel even a thing? *googles* well seeing as the only results are Borderlands the Pre-Sequel)  To add a bit more clarification or to completely lose you: The story is actually taking place AFTER Borderlands 2, but in story format, as told by Athena  (A secret agent-type, gone rogue. You meet her in Borderlands 1's The Secret Armory of General Knoxx) .   For simplicity sake lets just say it's an 'in between' game. You play as one of Handsome Jacks henchmen and discover what eventually led to his turning to the dark side. Okay, not star wars, but the 'turning' aspect or 'corruption' felt very similar. You start out by working with a cheerful happy-go-lucky employee of Hyperion, and see him slowly descend into a paranoid power hungry shell of his former self.     Controls:  The controls feel pretty much the same as Borderlands 2, or generic FPS's, WASD to move, mouse to move the camera, keyboard rebinding is available, mouse wheel up or down to change weapons, or press 1,2,3,etc. I've always liked the controls in Borderlands games, simple straightforward, no keyboard piano playing.  But wait!  There is a few new changes ! Namely Gravity! If you're outside of a location that has artificial gravity  (inside a ship, indoors, in a base, etc)  you will float higher on your jumps. While definitely entertaining, and adding a whole new level of stress when you miss a long jump.  (have you fallen into the abyss slowly? It's agony!)  There's a new mechanic that you can also press CTRL (or whichever key you bind) to slam down onto the ground, or on top of enemies. A new gear slot will represent an air container which is necessary for all humans to survive in the vacuum of space but furthermore doubles as being used for double jumping in space.  (You can jump once, then jump again at the expense of air)  Enemies sometimes drop air canisters that will replenish some of your air, there are other locations where you can go to get oxygen filled up, buildings, and specific devices which create a force-field of air you can stand in.   Progression:  There are several sources you can get a sensation of progression in Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel. The most obvious representation of progression is by story progression or level progression. After you finish the story you can repeat the story again to continue leveling until you reach the cap.  Or you can reroll another character, if you made the mistake of playing Claptrap on your first play through like I did. For those that don't know, even though claptrap is hilariously annoying vocally... he makes a terrible playable character, when you use your special ability you're basically rolling dice and the game tries to judge your situation for whichever vault hunter power to immitate. Unfortunately the game decided my situation required me to blow myself up 9 times out of 10. Yes I'm a bit salty about that. I don't use self destruction abilities in any video game really. So yeah, good times. It was fun hearing his cackling while I bounced on top of people, and it was nice not breathing air. Butttttt... I was a liability.   Style/Graphics/Appearance:  Borderlands doesn't try to aim for 'realism' in their game assets, instead they stylize their characters, models, and textures. This is very good in the long run, because it increases the longevity of the games appeal. You don't need to jump into the most recent game to enjoy the newest aesthetics, they start to average out over all their games. Don't get me wrong, there is a sign of improvement from game to game, but the style they use stays very uniformed rough and 'Borderlands-y'.   Price/value/game time played: Borderlands: The Pre-sequel is priced at $39.99, and the game with the season pass is priced at $69.99. If you're an achiever you will need to get the 'Holodome Onslaught' and 'Claptastic Voyage' DLC to earn 100%. At the time that I'm writing this review I've played 36 hours of Borderlands: The Presequel. That number will definitely change, there is still plenty to do, so you can definitely get your moneys worth out of game time.   Conclusion:  All in all, I've enjoyed what I've experienced with Borderlands: The Presequel, It's been most fun playing it with friends. I've enjoyed 'flying' around  (okay, it's not really flying, it's 'falling with style'.)  and as I so eloquently imaged it  'Mario Butt Pounding'  the NPC's. In a way the game feels shorter then it's predeccessor  (borderlands 2, man this 'pre-sequel nonsense is complicated, isn't it?) , so if you're looking for the best quality borderland games, this one doesn't have too much to offer outside of a couple new gimmicks and a few new playable characters. Story-wise, it's definitely worth it and very interesting! This game makes me want to own Jacks Hyperion Jacket.  (Why doesn't Borderlands have a clothing line?)  In conclusion, I'm not sure what to tell people, It's borderlands 2 ...in space! If you like borderlands, if you enjoy FPS, if you like the humor in the game series, you'll love this game just like borderlands 2.",

I think that's because the game is almost identical to Borderlands 2, don't expect any revolutionary gameplay changes or a lot of new features.   It really feels like a big DLC, with a new story and new characters to play as. I don't like the characters (neither NPCs nor playable ones) as much as the ones from Borderlands 2, but then again, maybe that is because I played Borderlands 2 so much.  What I did like was the hole space and vacuum atmosphere, it's done quite well, you have low gravity and a ground stomp attack to use against enemies. Downside: You have to make sure your oxigen supply doesn't run out (unless you're Claptrap)  You got laser guns to go along with the space theme, which are kinda cool, too. Elements still work the same as in Borderlands 2, though there is no Slag - it has been replaced with Cryo weapons, which can be used to freeze enemies solid which then increases Melee damage, explosive damage and critical damage - not exactly like slag, but similar.  I'm not sure about the dialogues (your character talks now, too), but at least when playing Claptrap, it's pretty funny and the humor is definitely still there.  Though I didn't enjoy the game as much as Borderlands 2, I can't say that it's a bad game, so I'll definitely give it a thumbs up!",

How anybody can rate this game in a positive light has never played a Borderlands game before and I would even go as far as saying has never played a game before. There are huge gaps in the story, random invisible walls, stupid mechanics, an extrememly small amount of bosses and unrewarding loot. Let me start with the loot. I played this game with 3 other friends and we all played a different class. We saw 3 legendaries, 1 of them being from a vendor and the latest drop was around level 21. We found ourselves being extremely overwhelmed with the enemies strictly because we had no loot drops. All the crates and loot thingys around Elpis contained commons and greens, sometime an epic or two. But most of all we found ourselves grinding out money to afford to buy a weapon or grenade mods to kill whatever we needed to kill at the time. Next up are all the glitches in the game. There are random invisible walls all over the world in spots where you have a clear line of sight to a ledge or a cliff that will just stop you and make you fall to your death; there are gaps in which you must jump over with your vehicle but even with a boost going top speed youd make it 50% of the time. The rest of the time youre falling helplessly into lava pits. Elevators will randomly glitch out and keep going up and kill you, bosses jetison loot out of their bodies when you kill them only to find yourself chasing the loot into a black abyss of nothingness, thus losing the loot forever. The characters are probably the most disappointing thing to me. Athena and Claptrap by far talk the most, and even then its not that much. Wilhelm and Nisha say next to nothing which is dissapointing because they are Jacks right hand people in Borderlands 2. They never address very important plots holes (I will not say in fear of spoiling it for people), and the end of the game seems extremely rushed. In total there are about 9 bosses. All of which are just point and shoot with no mechanics whatsoever. The typical comedy in the Borderlands series falls short in almost every avenue. The only redeming thing was Claptraps typical quips. Other than that, nothing. Cringe worthy material that is sure to make anyone feel dumb and awkward. There are pop culture references in the game that are just God awful. So awful to the point I almost ALT+F4'd out of the game. Having put in hundreds of hours in Borderlands on 360 and hundreds of hours on Borderlands 2 I can say I lvoe this series. With the exception of this. It is terribly short (we beat the entire series in 16 hours) and that was doing side quests and messing around at some times. The raid boss is just a harder version of the final boss. Overall this was a HUGE dissapointment and I will probably never load this game up again. I am very sad.",

            "review_text": "6/10 - This game feels a lot like just a big addon for BL2, which in and of itself wasn't that bad of a game. This game DOES add a lot of new things to the experience to freshen it up a bit. I feel like the game relies a bit too much on its sense of humor as a selling point. Honestly as a successor to the previous game, I felt as though this was a let down, let alone the price of it. Game play is still solid, shooter at its core. May revise this depending on how the DLCs that inevitably will come out do. All in all nothing too new here, didn't feel like it was worth 60 bucks.  EDIT: After having had a chance to more thuroughly play this game and feel it out, I'm revising my previous score of 6/10, I now give this game a 4/10. Between the amount of hindering glitches from the previous game they left in (mostly in the UI), the inclusion of new ones (mostly graphical that I've seen at this point), and the removal of some beneficial ones, it has become obvious to me that they made no honest attempts at playtesting this game outside of the already known bugs that gave us an 'unfair edge on the game', and giving little to no thought or care of the bugs that impeded us in the previous game (Ex: The UI bug in bl2 where it would jump to the opposite end of the list you are selecting if you attempted to interact with it too quickly). In addition to this, the AI feels the same in how annoying it was in bl2 where their pathing and movement was generally braindead until you got put into fight for your life, at which point every enemy within range would make a direct beeline for cover, sometimes as I've noticed, even clipping through walls and floors to do so, this made the combat feel tedious at times, and outright unfair at others. They also essentially remade the BNK3R fight from bl2 which I had a personal distaste for, if only because there were periods of anywhere from 2-5 minutes at a time where the boss would not even come into range of attack putting you in a deadlock of dealing with enemies and dodging mortar rounds from the boss that you could not hit. While they fixed not being able to hit the boss for this one, they made its attacks much more damaging, gave it more health from the looks, and threw in harder enemies to fight between phases, all of this is compounded with the fact that I found ammo to be scarce in this fight, constantly putting me in a position of buying ammo, or leaving the area to go find more. In general this game offers nothing new that is any good beyond laser weapons, zero gravity, and the cryo element which just feels like a slag that stuns. The story was a decent link between games however, but not enough to make up for its shortcomings.  EDIT 2: I feel as though I may have been too harsh with the review. All of these things I still hold to now, however I no longer feel as though they are as much of a detriment to the experience as I initially gave credit for. In all of it's shortcomings, it is still a Borderlands game. That being said, several changes and patches were made to this game to this point in time, a lot of these changes were bad, some were subsequently good to fix them, and public accounts from the devs were made that tweaked some members of the Borderlands community a certain way. Social media stuff aside, these changes IN THE END helped improve the game to a certain extent. With that in mind, what will likely be the final revision in my score is now 5/10. I still do not recommend it over BL2, but if you are looking for a fresh experience, provided you take it with a grain of salt, you may enjoy this game.",

            "review_text": "I don't think the game is really worth the current pricing. With a discount though, it's probably worth it. Here's why:     Poorly balanced, just as bad if not worse than Borderlands 2. I still play BL2, mostly because I have friends to play with, but nobody I play with thinks that getting downed in 2-4 hits feels fair. In BL:TPS this doesn't seem any different. The higher level you get, the stronger the issue seems to become, especially if you're having bad luck with loot drops, i.e. having less of a fighting chance.     Bosses are few in my opinion and they almost don't feel meaningful, even though they're supposed to have a major relevance in the story's development.  Bosses are also, again, poorly balanced. They often have minions that join the battle, presumably so you can get second winds if you go down, but they almost do the opposite because of their own individual power.  The last and before-last bosses atleast had some 'loot explosions' but I must have been extremely unlucky because most of it was junk, this despite the fact that I had really crappy equipment, many levels out-dated, which made me struggle to do the actual fights.     The story was good for the most part, but it feels rather short and the way the characters evolve is predictable (somewhat understandable) but I just think there could have been - a lot - more character development. Oh, right, and almost everyone that isn't a character of some importance has an australian accent, which seemed to get old a little fast for people who watched me play through.     Interface. Everything is the same as BL2, which isn't bad by itself, but the BL2 UI had some ergonomic issues -  such as the poor handling of the way the interface 'slants' and panels block each other  - and had a few glitches that haven't been fixed, like one that happens when scrolling through the backpack. In addition, the way Eridium is just translated into Moonstone is a bit unimaginative, as it serves the exact same purpose, and the story explanation doesn't feel good enough to me.     Of all the Borderlands games, this has to be one with the worst bugs. Mobs go THROUGH the floors, walls, ceilings, whatever! At certain parts of the game I had to start areas over because of this as they made completing certain sections impossible. I've read that even you, the player, can fall through the ground but I didn't experience this personally.     Sadly zones feel too big and vehicles aren't useable in several zones, and in the ones that they are useable in, they have limited areas you'll manage to use them in. Very few fast travel stations in my opinion, considering how annoying it is to trek around. My biggest issue with the size of the zones though, is that if for some reason I needed to quit the game while doing the story bits in the larger zones, I'd get sent back to a stupid point that was possibly quite far from where I stopped playing.   Overall the game was fun to play and the addition of the new element was 'cool' (replaces slag from BL2 though) and the grinder added a bit of variety to the way you can go about getting or upgrading gear, although it feels slow and cumbersome, due to the way you will pile up even more stuff than usual in your backpack. But in the end, it feels more like an expansion of sorts for BL2 than an actual new game, still having 'old' issues. In addition, the fact that the story content is kind of short makes all of the content in general feel kind of short to me, with all the side-missions being more or less equal to each other than they usually would be in the past. Perhaps things will get better with DLC.  I'd like to recommend a ' Yes ' for this, but I can't. Too many little things.",

            "review_text": "gameplay and mechanics in TPS are miles ahead of Borderlands 2 where it gets boring trekking back and forth over and over again, this is because of a more intuitive map/mission design overall where they tend to give you almost all the missions the first time around rather than sending you back xxx times to a zone miles away.  story is not quite as long but i prefer that as it's probably the right length to avoid it becoming a chore. story also feels less contrived to me, while still having it's weak moments, the setting feels a lot more involving. the game world is slightly more linear which leads to it feeling less like a free-roaming game - this would have been very easy to remedy imo.  the oxygen and jump boost mechanics are definitely a breath of freshly generated air, making travel on foot more efficient but also more enjoyable as it just gives that bit of extra freedom that allows better traversal of the often jagged landscape that is almost trademark to the Borderlands series. it is very rare for the oxygen mechanic to pose a problem as there are O2 generators everywhere, and when it does, i feel that it adds to the exhilaration, as you desperately sprint to find that precious O2 refill, while your health very slowly ticks down (when O2 is completely empty). i like how managing the jump boost and O2 becomes a balance, as you use O2 to boost and speed your travel whilst trying not to deplete your supplies too much until you see another refill point.  new hoverbike plays nicely, brings an alternative utility for a vehicle with it's ability to propel itself upwards for a few seconds. other traditional BL game mechanics such as storage deck upgrades take a more streamlined approach, mostly quality of life improvement to avoid players standing around wasting time for example at the slot machines. new lazer and cryo weapon types are both interesting and effective.  the heroes! they are just generally much cooler and more badass in TPS than BL2, and it's not just their look/characterisation, but also the special abilities which definitely pack more of a punch. overall this adds the feeling that they actually deserve their legendary reputations, unlike BL2 where it's more about SAYING how badass they are rather than just simply being badass.  by far the worst aspect of this game is the lack of good DLC, as the only real, fully-fleshed DLC is the Claptastic voyage, and while that has novel ideas and style to it, it starts to get dull before too long. this game desperately needs new DLC areas set elsewhere on the moon of Elpis, something i fear it will never receive now.",

If you're not a fan, probably nothing here will sway you. I personally love it. The Aussie humour won't appeal to all but I kinda like it. The new weapon-types are pretty cool: laser weapons and cryo elemental damage is well implemented. I like at least something about all the new characters. Athena, Nisha, Wilhelm, Claptrap and Jack (note: at time of writing the final dlc character hasn't been released) all have something going for them, be it tanking, damage or healing. The graphics are pretty timeless due to the nature of the engine and the soundtrack is up to the usual standards. Boss fights are generally fun and the storyline, presentation and dialogue is generally hilarious/appropriately serious but with a few misses. But yes, it does kinda feel like a glorified expansion.  To summarise, if you love the series, essential. If it's 'like' rather than 'love', you'll probably like it but it's not essential to your life.

A few pros vs cons  Pros: Good weapon balancing - The choice of having higher end guns available at all times really helps out in the long run Money's worth - Money is really important in this game for once. I held on to 7mill in BL2 because it was useless, but in this game I'm lucky to have 100k. Money is used to buy out top-gear items like purple or legendary items that can occasionally come up in the vendors. Interesting Dialogue - As always, Borderlands makes the dialogue either have some deeper meaning or is flat out hilarious.  Introduction to new items - The added types of weapons, the O2 kits, and new abilites are amazing New characters - Yo, Claptrap? For real??? lol, love the new characters  Cons: Storyline is somewhat bland - Parts of the story are repetitive, but it does come with a rather big surprise at the end Doesn't seem like a 'new' game - Although I was stoked it was so similar to Borderlands 2, it didn't feel like a new game, just a DLC of Borderlands 2  All in all, 8.5/10, def recommend it, super fun and only gets better on harder modes + friends.",

Many of the problems/bugs in Borderlands 2 were fixed in this game and while I do miss the ability to just jump out of the map from time to time due to Borderlands 2 imperfect map boundries, it is a change for the better to provide more freedom of movement, whilst making sure that the boundaries for maps are more secure.

The third installment in the Borderlands franchise brings back pretty much everything you loved from Borderlands 2 and added new gravity mechanics and weapons. For those who believe this was just a large DLC I will say because of the same engine yes it feels much like BL2 but I feel they added enough to make a full game. However being a diehard Borderlands fan I can't help but feel slightly disappointed in 2k Aus's take on the franchise. The content and gameplay of the game seems to grow stale after awhile, something that didn't happen for me in either of the previous games. As for the endgame content well compared to 2 there's really none to be found past maybe 3hrs of beefing up your character. I will say it pales in comparison to it's former titles but it was still a very enjoyable playthrough and in my opinion completely worth buying but I hope for great DLC additions like we saw in BL2, but until then I wait for gearbox to take the reigns back for the gameplay aspect because everything else is still just as good as it has been. 9/10",

Gravity jumping Weeee. only to be shot when 3 miles in the air. killed fall back down, then attempt to get a 2nd wind. Then we have flying loot due to anti gravity. When loot is this rare you do not want it flying off in to the Cosmos or Lava flows. Grinder was a way to deal with the weak loot system.  This instalment of the franchise, even took the shine off Borderlands 2 for several weeks. Which gave me time for quiet reflection. After many hours of reflecting, realised this was a whole lot of Tosh. 2K Purely just cashed in on the good name that was Borderlands 2. This game is pitiful in the ways you'd not expect it to be.  You'll die a lot more, mostly due to falling into space or lava or glitches in the level.  Never has one been promised so much, only to not have it delivered. Shock horror. 'Sell the Sizzle not the Sausage' business model was used here.  To sum up; if you have never played any Borderlands games do yourself a 'Solid' Buy Borderlands 2 it is better in every way.

If there were better DLC's and a more of a storyline other than watching the downward spiral of a character who was from the start, a jerk (I'm being kind here) I would have enjoyed it more. I was excited for this game at first. After two full playthroughs and testing some of the other new characters out, I had this feeling inside that wanted something bigger for all the hype I had read about.   Pros:  I did like the new laser weapons and the butt-slam ability, it was different. I often found myself trying to butt-slam in BL1 and BL2 and facepalming later.   The playable characters were a bit of a surprise. Most of my playtime was with Athena however.   Cons:  Austrailian humor? Yeah sorry folks, a lot of the stereo-typed voice acting/jokes were a total turn off.  Didn't really need a backstory to a character that I didn't particulary care for to begin with in BL2.  So it's totally okay for one character to just completely forget about part of their past in one game..then in this one they are demonized terribly and everyone seems to hate them now? Huge failure on the writing team. Good job making your storyline sound like it came from a bad fanfiction site.   Bottom line:  I wanted to enjoy this game, I really did, I've recently un-installed and tried to forget about it. If there is going to be a BL3..I'm going to be wary of it after this fustercluck. I've seen too many other reviewers saying they are jumping ship on the BL fandom. They need to bring back the writing styles of the BL1 team and get rid of that Burch guy! He's a t-w-a-t.   If you're still wanting to pick up this game, wait until there is better content and when it's on sale for like $25 or so, as it stands right now, it really is not a 60 dollar game, way too short, poor content and it left an ache in my already dark husk of a heart.",

The characters have a lot more mobility options than previous games. Sadly, to this day, lots of main bosses are not farmable.

But the game adds nearly nothing into the Borderlands formula, except for zero-g jumping and (nearly pointless) oxygen tanks. The jumping is a great addition and I hope that they keep that in the future games, but besides that, I don't think this game does anything better than Borderlands 2.  I didn't find it to be quite as funny, except for a few missions. There are no stakes in the story because it's a prequel so you know what will happen.Most of the time they are merely filling in some blanks, or retconing the ♥♥♥♥ out of things. Also, Claptrap is able to go up stairs, which is simply wrong. The game is also far shorter than BL2. They did have a pretty nice variety of different locations, but even that pales in comparison to BL2.  This game is NOT worth a full price release. It should have been a 30€ at best. Gearbox is simply getting too greedy at this point. Still, even with all of it's faults, I did have a pretty good time playing through this game in co-op, so I am willing to give it a 6 out of 10. If you like the Borderlands game, you will most likely enjoy this one. If you don't, this game will do nothing to change your mind. I can't comment on the quality of the dlc's(those have been really good in the past) because I have not played them, and I'm not exactly eager to buy a season pass to something that propably should have been a standalone dlc in the first place!",

Now that I finished a single play through in 16 hours, I feel very happy overall about the purchase and wouldn't have minded paying full price, but I rarely do that for any game anymore.   Pros: - Cryo weapons (and the Baroness addition). I always liked Fire in the last two games, but Cryo is pure fun. Freeze and shatter! - Butt slam! This gets a bit difficult sometimes when you get jangled up on enemies, but the butt slam sure is entertaining. Early on I found the O2 issues annoying, but once I got used to it the long jumps and butt slams became much more fun than traditional running and jumping. - Story is great actually. Jacks back story and Athena getting some more story is awesome. Makes for a good sensible entertaining storyline.  - Grinder. Even if I rarely get anything I actually like ... grinder fun. He insults you while you grind. - Moxxi is still around being awesome. - Laser beam guns are badass.  Cons: - Pickle. Shut the f**k up! Seriously this character was too much for me. Meeethane. I'll give 2k and co. a pass because they've made soooo many great characters (Tiny Tina is the best, Jack, Moxxi, even Patricia Tannis is pretty hilarious), but he is still a negative to the game overall. - 1 Legendary item for sale the entire first playthrough. ONE. No legendary items from chests or bosses. I find that disappointing and a bit absurd. I don't expect tons, but a couple here and there? - Final boss guy. Didn't enjoy his over the top one shot me ability. The bigger version was okay, just took awhile, but the first part you fight was just annoying to me. - Sparse. What I mean is that I felt like half the time was spent running back and forth with minimal enemies. I want hordes of midget shotgunners and psychos! That is the most fun. - Pickle again.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this if you like the series at all. The first Borderlands is still by far my favorite, but 2 and the Pre-Sequel are both great follow ups.",

            "review_text": " Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel is not as bad as what you think it is.  As a hardcore Borderlands fan, you'll be disappointed for sure but as a regular FPSRPG game, you will not be disappointed. Some good points that the game has and does better than Borderlands 1 &amp; 2 is that the characters are more fun to play as and combat is more interesting as you have the ability to do double jumps and butt slams. For each character, you can come up with many different builds and that really helps up the replayability. Another good touch that the game has is that the character you play as actually responds to what the NPCs have to say.  However, as much as I like this game, there are still some glaring issues with the game that I would like to point out. One of the issues is that some of the missions just drag out for too long. This makes it very tedious for the player to go through and also makes it very repetitive. Speaking of repetitiveness, this game can get boring at times in my opinion. While I do believe that there is a good amount of replayability withtin the game, this game does not have as much replayability as Borderlands 2 as it suffers from the lack of end game content. In Borderlands 2, after you finish the campaign, you are able to farm these raid bosses for loot. In Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel, however, there is only one raid boss to farm and that raid boss is the same as the final boss but just a more beefed-up version.  Overall, I do recommend this game as it is a lot of fun and you are sure to sink in tens and probably even hundreds of hours into the game.   FINAL RATING: 7/10 ",

The one thing that makes this game brilliant, is that it's a connector. A game in which many questions are answered, a game in which makes you think and look at the other games and go 'Wait, is that guy from this game? Did this lead to that? Oh, that's why that happened.' And so forth.  And the lasers, oh my sweet jesus. I freaking love lasers.

By not being a DLC for BL2 they are able to dump some of the mechanics that didn’t work and get a fresh start without high level characters just blowing through it all.  A lot of the haters talk about it being not as long at BL2 as though that’s a bad thing. I personally felt the main campaign in BL2 was too drawn out and made you do too much running around doing menial tasks to draw the story out. When people talk about how awesome BL2 was they are looking at Tiny Tinas or Torgues or scarlets DLCs. Just for reference I had all classes to 72 so I went through that painful storyline a LOT.   I felt TPS kept a better flow going and the missions weren’t stupid stuff meant to delay me. Having it be its own game let it dump some of mechanics from BL2 such as Slag which caused all of the higher bosses to be balanced around its use and instead replaced it with Cryo which freezes things solid.   The campaign is about the same length or a bit longer than BL1.  New weapon type in the Laser, there are a couple of different laser types, the beam type which gradually become harder to hold on target, the railguns which are sorta like a mid range sniper and laser shotguns which aren’t really much different from regular shotguns. Some of them can be useful but they aren’t earth shattering. The butt slam can be a lot of fun, I have buddies who will blast through areas just butt slamming everything that moves and giggling like little kids the whole time.   As for the classes they bring a different bag of tricks than the BL2 characters. There is no one character who is completely overpowered like there was in BL2 (I’m looking at you Salvador).  There seems to be a bit more attention on characters benefiting each other than there was in BL2. In BL2 there were only 6 skills that benefited teammates and like three times as many that a group oriented in TPS.  Very good game, and I look forward to what they come out with in the future DLCs ",

You don't see any orange weapons until the last 30% of the game, and then they're so abundent that they're not that special anymore. The bosses aren't difficult at all really, i only went down once or twice with even the final bosses (keep in mind i had 0 orange weapons). And to add on to that, 80% of the orange weapons are exact copies from BL2, name/design and all! Kind of lame if you ask me. I would never pay full price for this game.

All with 1 out of (Don't quote me on this) 8 brand names and different adjectival properties which enhances certain devices within the weapon, I have read over 17,500,000 weapons are availible (There may be more) so your bloodthirst for killing aliens with a fancy weapon is granted in thousands upon thousands of opportunities. The vanity profile is something close to me aswell, I have always loved being able to individualize your own character to prevent running into someone in multiplayer looking exactly like you. Everyone wants to stand out and give a motive of power and an impression of skill but many people have figured that earlier players focus on their cosmetics that their skill declines and the facade of skill lifts. The campaign has many missions filled with skill testing limits (I definitely recommend playing with a friend, but singleplayer is still god in itself) and if you're stuck on a level then there are even larger side quest missions to play in reward for a new gun, some money or moonstones or a vanity item. It provides an unboundable amount of fun regardless of difficulty sometimes or frustration, I still play it now and again as it never fails to provide to my seeking eye when it comes to 'action, adventure, weapons, space' the variety of the needs people want in a game is scarce with agreement aswell as many people don't understand the cartoon-style graphics, it may put some hardcore battlefield fans off this game.

            "review_text": "I totally love the Borderlands series, having invested over 600+ hours and counting in Borderlands 2. I love the artwork, humor, dialogue, quirky characters, and the GUNS. Borderlands 2 was one of the best games I've ever played and will always hold a special place in my heart.  However, this review is not on Borderlands 2, but on Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel. Yes, it has incurred a ton of criticism for not being as large as Borderlands 2, falling short in places, and it retaining most of the gameplay features and mechanics from Borderlands 2. However, this was to be expected. Gearbox Software had repeatedly stated that Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel would not be as large as Borderlands 2 and would be built off of it, being more of an 'extended' expansion pack. In addition, the development cycle for the Pre-Sequel was only 2 years, and it would certainly be tough to craft an entirely new game that would wow fans and blow them off their seats at E3.  Despite that, Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel has some flaws that cannot be denied. (Let's go look at the cons first)  1) The unbelievable price tag.  Although this game is certainly good and it would be a great thing to support the devs, I feel like forking out $60 USD is definitely not worth the content. Even worse, if you wanted to grab the Season Pass with all the DLC, the price would be even higher. For a game that doesn't contain that much material and substance as Borderlands 2, I find that unacceptable. I bought the Pre-Sequel + The Season Pass bundle for around $25 and I find that a much better buy that is worth the money. $60 for a main game that lasts you barely 20+ hours (including completion of side missions and the main campaign) is not worth the buckaroos in my opinion.   2) The endgame. Borderlands 2 had a great endgame with far more replayability than the Pre-Sequel's endgame. In Borderlands 2, even after you've completed the side missions, you still had tons of stuff to do, bosses to farm, and loot to acquire. In the Pre-Sequel, I felt strangely lost and aimless after completing the main campaign and main side missions. There was not much left to do and I wasn't as motivated to go for multiple playthroughs.   With the cons out of the way, let's go into what makes this game stand out from Borderlands 2.  1) Player-characters. Let's face it. The Pre-Sequel has the best player-characters in the franchise. I had tons of fun experimenting with WIlhelm, Athena, and Nisha, and I've yet to play as the other 3 characters, which is something I look forward to doing. The difference between each character is noticeable and the playstyle you adopt varies with the character you choose. You can't play Wilhelm the way you play Nisha and vice versa. In addition, I love how some of the dialogue differs with the player-character you pick. It's a small touch, but I feel that it adds to the characterization and personality of each player-character, which was something missing from Borderlands 2. In Borderlands 2, I felt like a silent participant of events. Your character doesn't talk much and doesn't give any verbal responses to questions or happenings in the story; but in the Pre-Sequel, you get to see how each individual player-character responds in the same situation. One of the few reasons I went for multiple playthroughs was to experiment with the different playable characters and hear their unique dialogue.   2) Story. Although the story isn't the most intriguing and engaging one I've experienced as of yet, I felt that while it is shorter than Borderlands 2, it is better in certain aspects. While the story of Borderlands 2 was easy to craft since the Borderlands lore had plenty of area to explore and improvise on, linking the events of Borderlands 2 with another event is something different. I enjoyed seeing how the game portrayed a somewhat heroic and actually likable Jack slowly transforming into the villain he would eventually become in Borderlands 2. This game gives some background information to Borderlands 2 and once you've played this game, you can play Borderlands 2 from a new perspective and view Handsome Jack a little differently.   3) Added features. I personally loved the addition of lasers, the cyro element, and low-g environments since they added new depth to the game. Lasers are diverse and they are extremely fun to tinker with. The glitch weapons from the Claptastic DLC are also awesome and I would recommend getting that DLC or the Season Pass if you want the whole lot of DLCs and playable characters.   In conclusion, this reskinned Borderlands 2 has its flaws and upsides, and it does balance them out quite evenly. I wouldn't recommend buying this game at its current price of $60, but buy it during the summer or year-end sale and you'll get something worth your money. If the price is low enough, go ahead and the get the Season Pass too. Just as long as you're a fan of the Borderlands series and are not expected something similar to the scale of Borderlands 2, you won't regret obtaining this game.",

I personally loved it just as much as BL2, but do wish there was more/better DLC. My favorite character to play as is Jack(the voice lines are a lovely bonus). I believe some people dislike it due to: 1. Being unable to adjust to new game mechanics and therefor blaming it on the game 2. Being overly picky and close-minded about how the game 'should' be  This game is definitely not for everyone, but if you play it with an open mind and are willing to be more creative with your tactics, this game will most likely surprise you. A quick opinion for those of you who I may have offended with that second point, the day you make a game as big as this and with all the different features while trying to keep a company afloat, then you can bash this all you want with 'how it should have been.'",

The combat is slow and boring, the characters are boring, the soundtrack is horribly boring, the story is boring, somehow they made the humor even worse, the guns are not satisfying to shoot, PhysX still runs like complete doo doo, missions are filled with TONS of wasted time and running around collecting seemingly useless crap.  Why does this game feel so different? At its core it should be the same kind of game right? I'm baffled as to how somebody could take such a solid game series and make a sequel as awful as this. It's as if a skyscraper had its steel structure built professionally, but then the rest of the building was made by a drunk child with hot glue and popcicle sticks.  It's the little things that kept me interested in the previous games. Let's be honest, Borderlands 1 and 2 made you walk around a lot and do a ton of seemingly meaningless stuff as well, but there was enough good banter over the NPC communications and enough reason to each objective to keep me pushing forward. After dying maybe 10 times from janky low gravity mechanics and then being forced to walk back across the ENTIRE map just to get where I was before I just lost all motivation to go further. The checkpoints need some serious revamping.  I hate to say it, but I think everything that could have gone wrong with this game went wrong. I got the game for free with my second GTX 780 so it's not a huge loss, but it's still a massive disappointment.",

But after actually going through the main story on two of the characters, and after discovering a few handy shortcuts to speed up a game, I figured I'd re-write this review to give it a fairer assessment.  First, while I would recommend it to those who are already fans of the Borderlands series, I would strongly recommend Borderlands 2 as an entry point for a new player over this game.  The Pre-Sequel has some good things going for it. Interesting cast of characters, a plot that gives a new understanding (of sorts) to the backstory of Borderlands 2, a new low-gravity environment to survive in; these features make this game stand out from the others in this franchise.  Unfortunately, most of the main complaints I had before are still valid even after completing the main storyline. Most missions feel unnecessarily long, with you having to activate second and third backup plans jsut to get one thing done. Also, the terrain is littered with instant-death lava rivers that you are expected to jump over in a car (And yet can't do), some of the conversations seem forced and/or unnecessary, and while you have a new low-gravity playground to float around in, it's quite easy to get lost in unless you know where you're supposed to be going.  Again, if you've played one of the earlier Borderlands titles, I'd recommend this game to you, but for those who are looking for a place to start, you're better off going to Borderlands 2 instead.",

What you're basically getting when you buy this game is a shorter, and half-♥♥♥♥♥ version of Boderlands 2. If you are new to the series, then start with BL1 or BL2, this is definetely not the game to start on, as it is the worst in the series. Don't get me wrong, the game isn't bad, it just isn't worth $60.00 and definetely doesn't live up to the expectations that I and lots of others had for it.  Pros: - Very interesting and well written storyline - Playable characters talk and say different things about the story depending on what character you've chosen - Good replay value - Interesting side quests and characters - Cool looking future DLC   Cons: - Glitches in missions that prevent you from progressing in the story unless you join an online match - Re-named and re-skined legendaries that don't have the special effects that they had in BL2, Ex: the conference call doesn't shoot from the sides anymore it shoots as a normal shotgun would - Short storyline - Farming for legendaries isn't as strong as it was in BL2, you get them mostly out of the grinder - Connection issues where you can't connect to any games and it just keeps searching for matches in matchmaking  Overall, this game is very fun and well made if not compared to BL2. In all honesty the game was a big dissapointment for me, and I would advise waiting for the christmas sales or a price drop. I would say not to go any higher than $30.00 if you really don't want to be dissapointed.",

This however, was the first and last straw - when I pre-ordered this game I put my faith in the company to produce me with an enjoyable experience, even if it wasn't to the same extent of Borderlands 2 - it HAD to be enjoyable. I expected an average game and decent amount of content - and this was a mistake on my part and flat out terrible consumer practice. I regret every cent I put towards Borderlands: The Pre-Sequal and the decision made now feels like a cascading nightmare upon my reality.  It has become abundantly clear that the developers involved are hell bent on poor business practices. Ripping off consumers by stripping game content to then later sell as 'DLC'. It is blindingly obvious in this game that is already over priced for the amount of content you receive.  The truth about this game is that it is Borderlands 2 with its very soul ripped out. If you like Borderlands or want to see what a good borderlands game is like buy / continue playing Borderlands 2. There is absolutly no reason to buy this game over borderlands 2. Otherwise keep clear of these games and be very cynical of developers like 2K Australia (Games) and Gearbox Software.

            "review_text": "Please not, that this is not the finished review for Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel! I'll update it once I played through TVHM with my thoughts on the endgame-content and the way TVHM works out.  The Story: I don't want to spoil anything, because pretty much everything that happens will work out in Borderlands 2. Basically, it's the story on how Jack became Handsome Jack, the villain in Borderlands 2. The side missions add cool additional insiders, such as the reason for Treshers living on Pandora. Everything is full of humor again and you'll meet loads of the characters you love from the second game of the series. The onliest thing, which I personally found a bit sad, is, that the villain this time (Zerpadon) is just a regular, evil, witch-like woman. No funny lines, no especial memorizable lines, just the normal villain you'll have in each and every game. It tooks me 22 hours to do each mission (both side-missions and story-missions) in Playthrough 1, the onliest quest, which is left, is the traditional raid-boss at the end, as I haven't found a team, which is able to beat him, yet, and can't solo him, due to a lack of skills.  The Classes: There're four playable characters again, without any of the DLCs. I'm playing Athena at the moment, so I can only say little about the other classes. Athena's special skill is her shield. She uses it to absorb damage and then throw it back at her enemies (up to four, if you got the right skill for it). The skill tree is equal in size and complexity to Borderlands 2, there's no overpowered skills or underpowered ones; as long as they fit your gaming-style, they're worth to go for. There's no relation between her and Borderlands 2. Wilhelm, the enforcerer, can summon two drones, which support him in combat. One supports his defensive skills and abilities, the other one actively fights enemies. You fight him in his final form in Borderlands 2 at around level 12-15. Nisha's a bit similar to the gunzerker in Borderlands 2, her special skill allows her to dual wield weapons. Sadly, this mode got an auto-aim this time, which makes it a bit less hard and challenging, else, the skill tree is focused on lawbringer-ish styles. She's the sheriff of Lynchwood in Borderlands 2, who you eventually fight in a side-quest. Claptrap... everyone should know him by now. He's the same annoying but funny robot as he always was. His special skill is a program called 'VaultHunter.exe' and allows him to scan the battlefield and use special-skills adapted to the situation. The skills include all classes available in Borderlands 2, and also the 'Gun-magician' and a pirate-ship. Yes, a pirate-ship. It fires cannons at your enemies.  The Gameplay: Of course, the main reason for playing game of the series is not enjoying the story. It's the quests, the loot, the gunplay. This can be summarized in only a few words. It's the EXACT same as it was in Borderlands 2, just with the difference, that you're in space now and there's no oxigen around most of the time. There's less gravity, making the overall experience feel a bit 'slower' than Borderlands 2. Also, you can double-jump now (which will use some of your oxigen) and smash down on enemies, which is quite useful and feels slightly overpowered with certain Oz-Kits. Those are a new item, which I'll go over in just a second.  The Items: The loot-system is the same as it is in Borderlands 2. I can't go over many legendaries by now, as I haven't found many. The ones I found were - as it seems - guaranteed drops by bosses, so nothing too special. A friend of mine had a double-legendary drop once, which was one guaranteed one and a random one. I THINK this wasn't possible in Borderlands 2, or at least I've never heard of it or seen anything like that. Correct me please, if that's wrong. There are a few new items:  First off, Laser-guns! These come in an interesting variety, all are classified as Laser-weapons, though. There're shotgun-like Laser-guns, SMG-like ones, and some, which have a kind of laserish fluent coming out of them, consuming ammo in specific amounts of time. Some of them feel overpowered, though, like the Zerpadon-one and the Moxxi-one. Secondly, there are Oz-kids now. You need oxygen in order to survive where's no oxygen, makes sense, huh? Also, it can be used to double jump and replaces the relics in Borderlands 2. Actually, it's like a relic, but with oxygen. The drop rates of greens, blues, purples and legendaries seem to be equal to Borderlands 2, at least to me, and in Playthrough 1 only by now (I spent around 300 hours in Borderlands 2, and it feels pretty much the same), however, I feel like whites are a bit more rare, especially in the later game. That's nice, though, as you won't pick them up except for reselling-purposes anyway.  The Difficulty: The game is easier than Borderlands 2. I didn't die at ANY boss, except for the final one, and I only died due to a lack of knowledge on how to fight him, as soon as I found out, I beat him at 'first new try'. I died like 30 times from groups of enemies, besides that I died like 20 times from jumping somewhere where I shouldn't, or getting thrown off the edge by enemies. That's not much for 22 hours of gaming, I remember having a way harder time in the first playthrough in Borderlands 2. I hope, the second playthrough gets a hell load harder. I liked it the challenging way. Oh, I can't solo the raid-boss at the end (I'm level 27 currently, got no legendary in use at the moment and have no super-duper planned build...) and have problems finding a group for him, which doesn't die all the time.  Summary: Overall, I think that Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel is more than just an AddOn to Borderlands 2. It's motivating, funny, will need at least 70 hours to be beat a 100% I suppose (according to my very own speed) and at least another 30 to farm for some legendaries and nice builds. And this on one character only. I guess it's fair to say, that, including the DLCs, which will come, you can have at least 200-300 hours of fun with this game, if you enjoy the Borderlands universe.",

The aesthetics is quite boring and most of the areas feels like its just one big area but thats to be expected becuase it is on the moon, there is one big thing about this game that really annoys me is that (personal opinion here) on nearley all main missions have sooo many detours eg. on a perticular area (going try not to reveal a spoiler) when you are meant to get robitc turrents and legs you literally have to go all over the map, but i understand the vanilla game size is quite small (aprox 5.4 GB) so we would have to be thorough on maps to make the most out of it.  now with most of the bad stuff out of the way good points: scaling of enemies and wepons is very nicley done, guns are more balanced (not fixed though) than they were in borderlands 2, you will get your first skill point at level 3 and so you will have a few more skills to buy, they have not made cryo as game breakingley over powered as slag in borderlands 2, charcter interact more with each other ,both NPC's and your playable characters, lazers are balanced extremely well to the point that it is your fault if they act good or bad, unless you got the unlucky chance of having a bad one And thats all folks.",

The game mechanics are pretty much the same, but with new characters, new maps, new storyline, etc.  tl;dr: if you enjoyed BL2, you should like TPS as well. If you didn't - don't bother. If you haven't played BL2 at all, you should definitely check it out first. Even though I recommend TPS, I can see why it gets so much hate.  Pros: - fun gameplay - fun characters - fun enemies (NO MORE DAMN SURVEYORS) - fun story - fun low gravity physics, adds more variety to the gameplay - fun new cryo element - fun this - fun that - fun everything - just fun - main protagonists have much more dialogue compared to BL2 - it's cool to see Handsome Jack playing a pivotal role in the storyline, even more so than in BL2 - lengthy base game campaign - the ability to grind unwanted items is a welcome addition  Cons: - not enough DLC content (unlike BL2, you won't reach max level having played UVHM just once) - it might not live up to the expectations of many - too expensive (€70 for the base game + SP at the moment, w/o discounts) - some of the loot from BL2 is missing, most notably (for me) The Bee and Infinity, also no pearlescent items, and glitch weapons are overall less useful than seraph weapons/items from BL2 - just one raid boss, and a lame one at that (pretty much the same as the end boss) - hardware requirements are slightly higher compared to BL2, while the graphics (or anything else for that matter) doesn't seem to justify that - no overpower levels - there's pretty much nothing to do after you hit level 70  Overall - Borderlands 2 is cheaper, it has more content and it doesn't feel like a 2 years older game in any way; it's a much better value than TPS. If TPS had more DLCs and was cheaper, it would've been just as good as BL2, if not better. It's a shame that 2K Australia went bust and the plug was pulled way too soon. Why didn't Gearbox pick it up and continue development is beyond me.

At the start of The Pre-Sequel, Jack is a bit odd, but has the entire universe's best interests at heart. By the end, in the most justified and logical descent into madness that I've ever seen, he has become 'Handsome Jack', the villain we all hate. I have nominated this game for the 'Villain Most in Need of a Hug' award, because though he may be the villain in Borderlands 2 and not so much the Pre-Sequel, this is where his story is told.

The story is heavily reliant on jack and borrows heavily on his humour, the only other humour is  immature Australian stereotypes which just come off as stupid and not funny.  But to be fair the gunplay is enjoyable sometimes and i do like lasers that go pew pew  -5 cause you didn't include a Bogan class  your better off buying all Borderlands 2's DLC which is as much content as this entire package a very average game.",

People seem to be giving this game a lot of crap for 'no new game engine' 'it's to short' 'it's to expensive' etc. etc.  Firstly, they don't need a new engine for this game, they have a good formula with what they have done in the past and I see no reason to change that, the game looks great for us PC players, not sure how consoles look. As the saying goes, 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it.'  Now, this game IS shorter than Borderlands 2 BUT I did every single side quest with the exception of like 6 on my first playthrough and that took me 18 hours, Now, playthrough times for everyone will vary, I don't speed run through but I don't take my sweet time either. That being said, minimum of 2 playthroughs for max level, grinding for gear, etc. you absolutely will get your $$$ worth out of the game.   Is it a 60$ game? That depends greatly on the person, I personally would get enough time out of the game to make it worth the 60$ price tag, other people might not, it's all on what you view as worthwhile.   My personal rule for games is 1$ per hour of game time makes it worth it for me, got the game through Green Man Gaming for 45$, I'll do that with just the first character easily.  TL:DR - In my opinion the game is worth the time and money, enjoy the pre-sequel. It ties the first 2 games together nicely.",

If you are planning to get this game, you should wait until it's at a more reasonable price because the price right now... I don't think it's really worth your money.

            "review_text": "Disappointing. The quality of supporting characters is poor (Pickle = the Jar Jar of borderlands), the dialogue is unengaging at best, jimmy rustling at worst. The player characters are well made dialogue wise, skill wise, etc. (except claptrap.), and the plot isn't terrible.  Jacks 'character development' is shaky, as he just seems to go from 0-60 evulz past the first level, and the continuity of the series is stretched a bit, particularly in Lilliths, Rolands and Moxxis involvement in the story, which would logically affect how jack treats them in bl2, however in bl2 he treats them as minor annoyances. Equally, how Lillith treats jack in pre sequel is completely counter to how she does in bl2.  Weapons are mediocre, being exactly the same manufacturers (they even didn't change the word 'Bandit' to 'scav' in the game files), lasers are badly balanced, cryo is pretty much just a rehash of slag with a little immobility added, and oz kits are just relics but with a timer that counts down to you dying. There are two vehicles in the game, one is a reskin of the Runner from bl2, and the other is just the Manta from UT3. The only difference is that the Manta from UT3 is actually elegant wheras its copied counterpart handles stupidly and its own jump and butt-slam gimick is clumsy and ineffective.  The sexuality of the characters was very, very forced. I started to take shots every time Janey Springs announced she was a lesbian, just in case we'd forgotten. On the subject of gender politics, male characters were shown to be homophobes, lonely creeps, or ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s more often than not. When compared to the female characters who are shown in a much, much better light, it leaves a little bad taste in your mouth, which didn't help me to overlook the previous flaws.  Finally, as the game starts from the end of BL2, it's impossible to play either game in any order, without getting spoilers for the other game, so anyone deciding to play in chronological order (Borderlands, Borderlands Pre-Sequel, Borderlands 2) is gonna have spoilers for BL2, and anyone playing in release order (Borderlands, Borderlands 2, Borderlands Pre-Sequel) is gonna have spoilers for Pre-Sequel.  Best aspect of this game? The mapping for Helios Station was incredibly refreshing, the interior and exterior aspects. Worst aspect of this game? The first boss. It tries to go with a 'So bad it's good' vibe '(Kill this guy ^)', but it's just lame.",

I came into this kind of expecting this would be something a bit better, but nope. It's the same well done hilarious Borderlands, if the style of humor just appeals to you. Guns are still fun to use and there're of course plenty of them. But it still feels like nothing has changed. The game is pretty long according to people, but what I played just felt like padding, a crapton of it like it was with Borderlands 1 and 2. Even if the game is long they've never made it exactly interesting to play.

There were times this game made me laugh uncontrollably, such as the basketball mission where the guy goes to make a slam dunk and breaks free of Elpis' gravitational pull while screaming 'BASKETBAAALLLLLLLLLLLLL!' I actually like most of the characters in the game, such as Springs. I was happy you met her during the beginning of the game because the first time you see her and her character intro really made me feel like this was going to be a good game. Also the story line was fantastic. I love storyline-based games to begin with, and BL:PS did a good job at connecting the events of BL1 and BL2, because that's what this game was supposed to be, right?   The second set of feelings I have are confused, upset, and a tad disappointed. The first thing I think of is the moon buggies and some of the level design. For example, Triton Flats, or even when you first get the buggy and you have to make a small jump over a pit of lava. I can't recall how many times I died, but it was absurd. As soon as I unlocked the Stingray, that was all I used so I could avoid getting aggravated. Who knows, maybe I'm just terrible at driving, but in BL2, I definitely wasn't.   I also didn't like some of the mission lines. It's one thing to have you traveling all over the map to pick up and complete past missions, but when you get a level 20 mission in an early level area, that just rubs me the wrong way, and the whole game was made like this. The only thing in BL2 that reminds me of this is the Cult Following missions, and that was my least favorite part of the whole game.   The last complaint I have about this game is who decided to look at the Borderlands and think, 'What if this game was a platformer?' Yeah, I understand that the game is based on the moon where there is no oxygen and low gravity; even praised the developers for how much thought they put into it by making incendiary weapons not work in the vacuum of space because there is no oxygen. I think that is brilliant and I also think that introducing a new mechanic was fun and throughtful, but I can't tell you how many times I haven't used the 'butt slam' in a fight, simply sticking with my guns/grenades.  TL;DR This game is great for Borderlands fans and fans of the storyline itself. The new mechanics are interesting and were  a nice change, but somewhat unmemorable for me in a combat sense. The platforming mechanic is disappointing because it almost takes away from from the FPSRPG Borderlands was originally.    Is this game bad? No, but it certainly is different.",

For example, I was able to kill the second boss in one clip with my laser shotgun after killing his shield generators, but died one and got knocked down about 15 times.  -No exploding laser weapons.  -Grenades roll waaaaaay to far in low gravity, so rubberized grenades are the way to go.  -Zarpedon is a way less cool villain than Handsome Jack.  -All laser weapons have scopes for some reason, which is really annoying for laser shotguns.  -There are no psychos, despite being on the cover art of the game.  Pros:  -Story is intriguing  -Laser weapons are badass  -so are cryo weapons  -staus effect stacking seems to be back.  -You get your first skill point at level 3 instead of level 5  -You start with two guns, in my case a pistol and a shotgun.  -Intro is a lot more fast-paced and interesting than in BL2.  -Nice visuals.  -Your character actually speaks, though not very much, it's still funny.  -The grinder is a good idea, but I can't seem to combine blue or purple weapons.  -Money is actually somewhat useful, unlike in Borderlands 2, where all you did was buy ammo.  Suggestions  Modding/workshop support would be awesome  Day/Night cycle. Just because you are on the moon doesn't mean that whatever star lights up Pandora doesn't exist. ",

If they fix most of the negatives, then this game will be on par (or better) than BL2. It is not worth the $60(plus $30 for Season Pass). I only recommend it only for the back story of Jack and his 'Vault Hunters' and the 2 'runthroughs'. Otherwise, wait until it is under $40 or GotY(if ever) edition is released.

            "review_text": "This post may become long. Readers be advised.  Borderlands 2 was the rage. With nearly three hundred hours on the record, it quickly became my personal favorite. I loved every bit of it - the design, the atmosphere, the witty-gritty humor, the characters and a really good, engaging plot for a shoot'n'loot game. Needless to say, I was super psyched with The Pre-Sequel as it was announced and it lasted until the day of release.  The beginning of the game made me feel like that again. Lots of action, witty dialogue, characters that seemed fun to play. And heck, we finally get to know Jack from his non-psychopatic side! That's what trailers promised. And for the first hour of the gameplay I was damn sure developers kept the word, making the game that would easily stand to previous titles of the series. But then you get to the moon, which you spend most of your game time on, and everything suddenly pops like a soap foam sphere.  First thing you notice - this game is aussie. The accents, the dialogue, even inside jokes. Compelling at first, quickly gets boring and irritating. At least for me, and I thought that I dig the regional humor. Turns out either I haven't really dug it or it is just poorly executed. Probably the latter. This is... Just not the same game. Moving on. Quests, both main storyline-related or sidequests, which varied a huge lot in Borderlands 2, here became either simple fetching, or simple killing, or combination of both, mostly involving also going a really long way across repetitive, uninteresting locations. Speaking of which - remember The Dust from BL2? The huge desert filled with quests and secrets like some kind of a sidequest pincushion? Here, on Elpis, you will get none of it. The game world is claustrophobically small compared to other games from the series.  The plot... See, Handsome Jack was one of the best written villains ever. It sounded rad - to finally see from behind his eyes, know his part of the story. What was done here is best described with two words: wasted potential. Also, it is really, really inconsequent in places. No spoilers, but... But it just is. There was not a single plot twist that would amaze me. Everything was... Predictable. I have expected something more. Something brilliant. What I've got is... generic at best. NPCs are not very memorable either. Nothing interesting about them, neither Nurse Nina nor that Springs chick, nor Meriff. Somehow, even the appearance, though episodic, of the old ones, like Mister Torgue, didn't manage to make me feel like that again. (Said Mister Torgue from overly masculine bag of muscle, which was the very core of this character being interesting, somehow became... a feminist white knight. Just what the hell... Though I admit it is good when games discuss important, current matters, the way it was done here just made me feel only disgust. It felt... flat, somehow.)  The game engine is buggy as a Thresher den. Characters get stuck in the landscape - a lot. The aim doesn't work properly, which is an issue in a game mostly built around shooting things. Speaking of shooting - new guns, lasers, cryo elements, suffocation. Sounds cool, but actually it didn't do much for the game's variability. If so, I've somehow felt it decreasing, in the end not really caring what guns I shoot.  New mechanics - low gravity, ground slams, oxygen supply. While fighting in low gravity, jumping, flying, jetpacking, slamming to the ground is really a good step forward and was done pretty well, adding some dynamics to stale combat, I think that whole oxygen mechanics is not very well executed. Instead of making the game more interesting, it became more of an irritating necessity to sometimes walk into rooms with atmosphere - on higher levels you don't really have to even do this, being able to suffocate for ten minutes and still somehow survive.  The new character mechanics is interesting, but truth be told - you won't have too much of an opportunity to use most of it. You've got Athena, which is female Zer0 with some tank capabilities, Wilhelm, who is Salvador-Axton crossover, Nisha, which is even more Salvador-esque and Claptrap who is completely unpredictable. Fun to play, but then again... The Developers gave you cool toys but no sandbox to play with them as much as you would want.  Other than that, there is not much variety to enemies you fight or stuff you do. There's not much to be done once the plot is over. I have managed to complete the game twice, once as Wilhelm, once as Jack the Doppelganger, but I really see no good reason to go for the second playthrough.  My verdict? 5+/10 at best, might add one point if you're as much a Borderlands nut as myself. And judging from what they did with Season Pass so far - I would rather dust off the good old Borderlands 2. It is just better in every aspect that this there Pre-Sequel.  I would also like to admit that I am terribly, terribly sad about how my most favourite series of all time has gone so much downhill. Not worth your money, my fellow player.  But then, that's my own two cents I am entitled to.",

One of the things I didn't like was that some of the jokes could be a little forced and dated. The beginning had a lot of this but as it went on the writing stablized.

            "review_text": "Do not buy this at full price, it is a shoddy Borderlands 2 DLC that feels short, empty and lacking.   My Problems with the game:  Guns: Fire weapons feel useless because most of the time you will be fighting in and out of oxygen zones meaning setting enemies on fire is hard and keeping them on fire is even harder which makes them feel far intherior to shock weapons. They removed slag and replaced it with cryo, cryo is decently fun don't get me wrong but it didn't feel like an addition so much as a lazy swap. Lazer weapons don't feel great to use personally because they lack impact and because of the way loot works, they often don't do a satisfying amount of damage either.  Characters: None of thier abilities had the same amount of fun that Borderlands 2 had, they reminded me of Borderlands 1. Not terrible, just vastly intherior to Borderland 2 and a little boring and this made upgrading them in the talent tree unappealing. I will say there is some fun to be had with using and upgrading Claptrap but that ability relies heavily on luck and can be equal parts frustrating as it is fun.  Areas: Anyone ever tell you how interesting and varied the moon is? No? Thats because it's not and this game does very little to change that. For most of the game you are going to be dealing with almost completely empty grey lunar landscapes broken up by grey factories with one area at the end which is vaguely interesting but nothing we have not seen a hundred times before in videogames.  Loot: Feels like you get very little loot and money, plus the loot that you do get is usually sub-standard gear that won't do a decent amount of damage. It seems like in order to get a gun that will do anything but slowly tickle your enemies to death, you need to buy one. Given the severe lack of funds in this game, it can be quite annoying.  Writing: The writing is hammy, cringy and has a clear adgenda. It feels like this game was written by an SJW who didn't know the meaning of subtlety.. All the good guys are suddenly gay or bisexual and feeling the need to tell you every 5 seconds which is wierd and straight people seem to only declare themselves as such if they are the badguys. Theres nothing wrong with being gay but it can be incredibly jarring when seemingly everyone wants to tell you about how totally gay they are, it shows the writers didn't write them as people but instead as 2 dimensional characters who's defining, and oddly popular, characteristic is thier sexual orientation. At one point Torgue turns up and goes full on feminist for seemingly no reason, it feels wierd, forced and incredibly cringy. Anthony Burch ruined the writing in this game by forcing his political opinions on the character and on the player.  Conclusion: I played this game with my girlfriend and on several occaisions we both wanted to put this thing down and give up. After pressing through the monotony and frustration we found that the game had very little to offer gameplay wise. The game is mercifully short however for some people this may be a negative as it represents significally less value for money. At a good discount this might be worth picking up for a borderlands fan, its alright but I didnt have as much fun as I did with borderlands 2 ...

We all asked for some form of end game content and all they gave us was a character which was just a model already used in the game,which is quite lazy, and a $10 (£7.99) arena with a few extra levels and a few 'New' enemys.

So for close to a hundred dollars.. you receive... a slaughter dome (level cap increase) ... 2 characters, and a forth unknown dlc as of yet and the vanilla game. So unless the fourth dlc... adds content to the story which lengthens it twice to what it currently is; this game is not worth buying.

I'm Australian.... but by god are those voices annoying.... like I honestly do not understand what they're on about half the time. Remeber in BL2 where you had Scooter with the typical redneck American voice.... that was amusing... and restricted to a few characters in the game.

I'd say more than half are reskinned, and renamed from BL2, which combined with the nonspwanble bosses makes the end game.... literally non-exsistant.

I think the added voice lines for the player characters really brought out more in the story. One of the major things I enjoyed about the game were the action skills. In previous installments certain characters had better action skills than others, but in The Pre Sequel I think each one holds a similar weight of useage. One of the things I didn't like was that some of the jokes could be a little forced and dated. The beginning had a lot of this but as it went on the writing stablized.   Last but not least, this game has one of my favorite DLC's in the entire franchise: Claptastic Voyage. Seriously if you do purchase this game and have a love of computer aesthetics (and Claptrap) please check this one out.",

And I had some high hopes for BLPS. Now, after having beaten the game, I even want my money back. This game, and Gearbox's ignorance, really pisses me off. Concidering there are still a few really annoying bugs and glitches, which Gearbox doesn't seem to care about that much. Also this game lacks raidbosses, (legendary)loot, endgame fun and campaign DLC (since there will only be one). It's just a small share of the thing I don't like about this game and daaaaamn am I happy I didn't bought the season pass. If you're new to the borderlands-series you should try the first BL or BL2 (in my opinion the best of them). If you've already played both BL and BL2, then why are you still reading this go back and play those games!  BL+DLC = €30,- BL2+DLC = €45,- BLPS = €50,-  Outcome: BLPS is ♥♥♥♥.",

This review is mainly from my first playthrough opinion as I can't devote the hours these days.  Pros:  Great gameplay Hero mix(both male and female) GBLT (gay bi lesbian and trans) This means that the developers appreciate not everyone is homosexual.  Great humor Loot More loot Lasers = pew pew Story chat dedicated to each hero, and unique responses.  Cons: Not as funny as borderlands 2 Story is a little lacking Feels like a borderlands 2 re-skin. Rather than a new engine. Skill tree dedicated to group play -.- I have no friends mmmkay. :'(  In between: Down under accent. EVERY WHERE. I'm not sure if this is a good or bad thing really. Springs is a great, funny,down under lesbian who provides great humor. Where pickle is an annoying little rat who wants to try to use British rhymes (like apple and pears the stairs) and be Tiny Tina.  Overall:  So far I am satisfied with the game. It has provided many hours of great fun. However it won't ever replace borderlands 2 in terms of story. The Vault hunters though provide some unique aspects to each walkthrough and the handsome jack DLC looks really good. Is it the best game ever? NO. Is it still fun to butt stomp people. YES :D   ",

            "review_text": "As a fan of Borderlands 1 and 2, I can easily say that this is the worst in the series, it's not even a close comparison.   The humour is very Australian oriented so as a American alot of the dialog that was ment to be funny, ironic or satirical flew right over my and my friend's heads. I think I chuckled at most maybe 3 times during the entire game (Which is about 18 hours long for a 100% playthru.) and 2 of those times were at Claptrap's expense.   The Vault Hunters themselves suffer numerous problems, first of which there is no specialization amongst them at all. In previous Borderlands there was a clear designation of who was the sniper, who was the support, but in the pre-sequel there is no sniper, instead everyone just has a couple sniper talents spread across their talent trees. Because of this you end up with a bunch of jack of all trades characters were none of them stand out in intresting ways. Their personality has alot to be desired as well, a fantastic example is Athena who stands out as being easily the worst character in the entire Borderlands series by virtue of being so incredibly boring, she could easily be a plank of wood with a face drawn on it and been a more exciting character. Nearly every line of her dialog reinforces the 'I'm a professional and only straight thinking in a crowd of loonies.' and god it gets old quick.   The returning NPC's stand out a bit better, though nowhere near as good as they are in previous games, some of the new NPCs like the Nurse fall completely flat. Like I mentioned previously with Australian oriented, alot of the characters are based on there or characatures from there so you'll be confused frequently on what they were going for or whom their parodying.   Overall in terms of mechanics its basically verbatim of 2 just with a annoying oxygen gauge that you constantly have to babysit or you slowly die while your sound is muted. The addition of laser guns is honestly forgetable, they don't really serve a niche in comparison to the already existing types of firearms and you'll just forget they exist mostly. It also still suffers from the exact same problems in Multiplayer were there is only shared loot with no roll system, enemies becomes instant kill with single shots and outragous bullet sponges if you in a group with more then 2 people.   I give the game a 4/10. I don't recommend you buy it nor do I think DLC will improve it to the point I would.",

For those unfamiliar with the Borderlands series, they're games all about FPS shooting and random loot drops for weapons, shields, etc. The Pre Sequel is similar, but includes new random weapons and special kits.   You get four new characters to play as, each with different special abilities. The characters all have three skill trees which improve multiple aspects.   The story takes place between Borderlands 1 and 2, and the main questline is pretty interesting. The dialouge is well written in most cases. The game can sometimes feel like a grind, but that's just how it is.  The enviroments are varied, and mainly take place on a moon. This means you can take extra big jumps, do ground slams, and run out of air to breathe. It puts a new spin on the combat. Certain enemies can seem a little too similar to Borderlands 2's enemies at times, but this can be overlooked.  Since this was done on Borderlands 2's engine with minor tweaks, the graphics are pretty much the same, although the Pre Sequel runs better on the same settings as Borderlands 2 on my laptop. The cel shaded look is unique, but that takes out pretty much all realism, which isn't a bad thing.   All in all, it's a great game. Some may argue it's just a cash grab and would be better suited as DLC, but I strongly disagree. The game has a ton of content and replay value. If you're not worn out from playing Borderlands 2, then this game is for you. If you're a fan of RPGs or FPS games, this game is for you. Even if you're a first time player, you can get into the game pretty easily without knowing the story from the other games in the series, although I recommend playing the games in order. My rating? 8.5-9.  Oh, and as of writing, I've put around 2 hours in the game, but only on Steam. I've spent a lot more time playing it on Xlive.  ",

Basically all the fun of BL2 is gone. The humor aspect is not there and seems to have taken a PC / pg-rated tone aka no midgets or enemies screaming stuff like 'midget lover!' (lol) at you. They are now 'Lil-'. In fact, the enemies don't yell anything, funny or otherwise. Granted, there are some funny parts like when you (non-spoiler) kill the kids dad (repeatedly) and everytime the kid says 'daddy went sleepy bo-bum-by-bys' or something ridiculous. However, most of the game you will not even crack a smile. Complete opposite of BL2. They even reuse several of the vending machine sayings from BL2. The writing staff for 2K Australia sucks.  Gameplay is boring. Several of the levels are really annoying. Feels like a bad DLC for BL2. Yeah you get lasers, ice, and low gravity, but everything else is the exact same.

Okay, remember Borderlands, bare bones of an awesome game? Yeah you do. And then Borderlands 2 came around and fixed everything, literally, everything. New UI, Added a real story, Better and more VAs, Better classes, Better loot, More random loot, More guns, More playstyles, More Guns, and enough DLC to turn the base, somewhat simplistic game (that was still awesome) into a truly epic wonderland.  Not only was BL2 epic, but it was such an enormous improvement over the first, but I didn't expect that for this, and neither should anyone.  In fact, this is as step backwards, in every way. If BL2 was two steps forward, this is one step back.   The maps are redundant, too-large for their emptiness, and worse than having every area look more or less the same? You WILL re-trek each area, repeatedly, for no reason, far in excess of what BL2 did. The worst aspects of the side quests in BL2, particularly the 'Go do this! Heyy . . .wait. . .can't do that, okay, so run to the opposite end of the map, do this, oh wait, can't do this, go ahead and run back now, do this third thing. Good, now go do the second, and then run all the way back to do the first thing that shoulda been the only damned thing!'   I don't mind a little padding, but almost half this game is padding. . . .And I love me some filler, but. . . the character just aren't 'there' in this one. I don't have a problem with the Aussie thing, dunno why so many do really (it was made there, and why do people seem to hate Aussies anyhow?) -- I don't get all the jokes, but most of them just fine. I dunno what a billabong is tho :P. Anywa, the filler is just lacking, and a lot of that falls on the characters just not having the appeal of BL2 . .. but c'mon, the whole joke with Hammerlock is that he is, polite. . . .and he's one of my favourite characters. I'm not asking for complexity here, and I think it is the setting that ruins everything. The moon was jsut a really, really, REALLY bad setting.  What's really irksome, is that I cannot imagine it really saved them that much money in the end to have a million moon areas that look identical rather than having a few terrains like BL2 had done, desert, ice, grassland, city, eiridium blight, canyon, city, another city (but totally different), Hyperion Base, Animal habitat (savanna?) -- and then DLc which each had their own distinct character.  I didn't even know where I was 80% of the time in this one because. . .it's all the damn same. Moon. Moon. Moon. Moon. Infuriating space-station open-space area, Moon, Space station, Moon, Space station, Moon, Moon, Vault.  The moon was an AWFUL idea.

As a matter of fact it felt like a low-gravity DLC for borderlands 2. Which is probably what it should have been. This game is not worth more than $40 as is.  While Borderlands 2 had a few rather annoying enemies, in The Pre-Sequel ALL of the enemies are really annoying.  The enemies butt-slam more than most players, which leaves you stunned and dead most of the time. A few areas felt impossible without a third or fourth player assisting. The map layouts are pretty confusing and there is only two kinds of map biome. Inside structures or city, and on moon surface. The similarities of the maps makes it feel like a very small game/world. The hit-boxes on enemies seems to be very small and hard to hit.  When playing on someone else's server I have noticed that less than 50% of my shots register and inflict damage unless I am right in the enemies face.  The jumping and gliding is nice outside of combat, but enemies do it too and they don't just glide, they fly.   I wish I had better things to say about this game. I really hope that 2k gets another try with a Borderlands game after this one. And I wish I could say that I recommend this game, but I simply cannot.",

If you watch the 10 minute introduction video with Torgue and Sir Hammerlock, they explain basically everything that I like that is new in this game. First, you're on the moon so there if very little gravity allowing you to fly across giant caverns of lava and make it safely to the other side. Using your O2 (oxygen) tank, you can redirect yourself in mid-air. Second, the gun algorithm has changed again allowing for a TON more guns than before. Who doesn't like more guns? Third, the maps are way better than the Borderlands 2 maps. If you havent played the original Borderlands, the maps in Borderlands 2 seem fine, but they aren't very good compared to the original maps. These maps in the Pre-Sequel are bigger, taller, and the design is better mainly because they need to be more navigable because of the low gravity. I'm not going to go into much deeper detail about the game, again watch the video that I mentioned earlier in the review because it explains in 10 minutes EXACTLY why you should get the game.

I'm thoroughly enjoying it and I'm sure I'll get more time out of it than the mere 40ish hours I got from BL2. It feels much smoother, and the change from red dusty desert environments is refreshing. One gripe, however, is the lack of unique weapon drops I came to love in BL2. I've played for 3 hours, killed countless enemies, and haven't found a single sniper rifle or shotgun; this is extremely disappointing, as these weapons gave Borderlands a lot more variety. It seems like most good weapons in this game need to be bought, which really takes a lot of the fun out of Borderlands since it's such a loot-based game, because now you're forced to grind for money in order to get good weapons.  Overall, I'd give it an 8/10 so far.",

            "review_text": "Rating: 7/10 -  Is the game good? Yes. Worth $60? Probably not... But its still a very fun experience. Good but not great so far, and I will rewrite my impressions when I am done.  The game is pretty much more of the same as far as Borderlands is concerned which is NOT a bad thing. Several aspects of the game feel weaker than the previous main installment, but the new elements such as the low gravity and slamming are fun and don't ever get boring.  The Good: Borderlands the Pre Sequel pretty much keeps the gameplay of the previous installments, which has always been entertaining, if not particularly groundbreaking. The new gravity and jumping mechaincs are fun from the start and stay entertaining throughout. Collecting ridiculous amounts of loot is still a blast, and the new environments are quite pretty. While some say the game's humor is very weak, I'd say its still strong, just very much diluted - Borderlands 2 had every mission as hilarious as possible, while the Pre-Sequel has a lot fewer outright funny quests and characters. This is, in my opinion, completly covered for with the frequently hilarious vault hunter dialogue, especially from Claptrap. Speaking of which, the vault hunters are a lot of fun both in terms of gameplay and humorous quips (except for Athena... she can be a bit boring). Finally, the story chronicalling the rise of the much loved/hated villian from Borderlands 2, Handsome Jack is so far solid and very entertaining. A few moments do fall flat, though.  The Okay: The new laser weapons are nothing spectacular - it feels like it fits in the series and they have their own 'feel', but they are not particularly spectacular. I feel similar about the loot - it fits with the series, but nothing spectacular. A higher number of 'exciting' loot drops would be very much appreciated. Also, combat seems rather inconsistant - some fights are relentless and brutal, filled with badasses and varied dangers (seriously, it feels like there are more badasses in some of the earlier missions than in the entirety of a run through Borderlands 2...), but other fights are quick and feel empty even when similarly leveled to the player. The Scav enemies are basically bandit analogues, and feel very similar to those in the previous game. Most quests are mechanically uninspired as well, being simple 'go to x, kill y' affairs. Though, since this was very much the MO for the previous games, I don't know what people were expecting...  The Bad: This game does drag at many points, and the lack of humor in some parts leads to stretches of the game that can be a bit of a chore to complete. In additon, some of the new characters are rather lame, and retcons to some characters feels done just for the sake of doing it rather than for any particularly good payoff - but that might change when I finish the game. Oh, and the timed quests are still annoying as ever, often requring you to go through an clear areas once (failing the quest because you took too much time) to have any shot at doing it on the second try. Doing them single player can be quite difficult in a frustrating way. Try not to play SP by the way if you can help it - the best aspects of the game (the vault hunters and fast paced combat) shine brightest with friends, while the worst aspects (the long boringish sections, and the unintersting missions) are exponentially more annoying solo. If you do not want to play multiplayer, consider my review a 6/10 rather than a 7/10.  The Ugly: The moon buggy can take a leap off the cliff, which is all it seems to be good for. You get another vehicle around level 10 or 11, and it is so much better it isnt even funny. The weapons for the moon buggy are fun though.  In summarry, a good but not great entry in the series. While it is more than an expansion pack, it isnt up to the standard of the previous game or its better DLCs (Tiny Tina's), but it is still a lot of fun and is more than a cash grab by 2k. Anyway, have fun on Elpis, Vault Hunters!",

            "review_text": "For $60.00 this is what I expected:  1. pre-existing BL2 issues and bugs Fixed. The only issue patched was the only thing useful in BL2. Bring back duping because not all of us have the luxury of farming for gear and moonstones for hours on end, and it's often the only way to remedy a hostile loot system.  2. 95% bug-free on release. This WIP is currently at 95% annoying, bug-filled.  3. It's already been established that gamers do NOT like Distance Running Simulators. Go work on Arma or Day-z if you like making endless running games. in other words, where the hell are all the Fast Travel nodes or Amped Jump pads that can catapult us accross a level, especially at quest turn-in?  4. I don't expect to purchace an Expansion/DLC as a full content, full priced game. This will be my first and last time pre-purchasing a game EVER.  5. Companies should own up to the WIP they release as completed work and give their loyal users a meaningful apology by way of monetary credits or AMAZING &amp; USEFUL in-game rewards.  6. Had I been new to Borderlands, the first few quests requiring jumping the gaps with a Zoomy and dying over and over would have turned me off completely -- RAGE QUIT &amp; UNINSTALL, turned off. Jumping vehicles via ramps should not require cartesian equation or machine-like timing.  7. A fully implemented and functional LOOKING FOR RAID or LFG function would have been nice. In fact, a much improved Match Browser and Stable Net Code is desparately needed.   What I received for $60.00:  1. Having completed the first playthrough, I can state that TPS felt like DLC. This is what $60 of gameplay looks like now?  2. The Objective markers have been rendered nearly useless and difficult to follow especially in large maps or when target objectives are in unorthodox places. Low gravity adds a new quest objective element, but the original BL2 marker system is inadequate and quite frustrating at times.  3. Running back and forth to complete quests gets OLD -- give us some Amped Jump pads or vehicle ramps to catapult us free of tedium.  4. Losing loot to clipping issues or Bad Asses' taking their orange loot off a cliff with them following a satisfying butt-slam is extremely disheartening.  5. Zoomy Ramp jumping should not be a source of frustration and endless deaths, especially at the start zone with the potential of forcing a RAGE QUIT &amp; PERMANENT UNISTALL.  6. Issue preventing many of us from posting any Steam Reviews about TPS was just coincidental, right? 'You must wait until this product has been released before writing a review for it' the message read, preventing me from posting my DO NOT recommend review. Maybe the sales quota hadn't been reached yet and they didn't want any prospecive buyers disuaded just yet -- hmmm.",

Second - characters. They are totally unbalanced and I even don't know what games designers were thinking off while making Athena, because all her skill trees are totally useless in multyplayer due to reasons below.  Third - level design and quest designs are poor. Not fun at all just being running from one end of the map to the other and back. The game quite lacks in department of humour and novelty (bring an NPC a teddy bear - I saw that in BL and BL2 for example). Gameplay is monotonous and there's literally no difficulty scaling of mobs or side quests as you level up. You end up followinf the main quest line as it's the only that is not trivial level of difficulty. Only effort was put in Jack's monologues but that's not nearly enough.

Most enemies are just retextured versions of Borderlands 1 and 2 enemies with different names and the same combat styles with slight variations. The story, at least to me, seemed rather short and uninformative compared to 2. You do get some decent information on Jack's rise to power and his actions in the second game... but you also miss out on vast amounts of possible info as well that simply wasn't added.  Gameplay is identical to the previous games with the added element of needing oxygen and a low gravity environment. Control in low gravity areas (which is almost everywhere) is fairly easy and I believe they did that well. The need for oxygen is rather annoying if you are someone who would like to explore or boost everywhere. One of the higher capacity oxygen masks that I found was about 170 capacity. Each full boost takes down 10 of that.... so you will quickly deplete your supplies if you want to move around quickly in the somewhat barren areas.  Going through the first playthrough was fairly entertaining and only slightly challenging, as it should be. The second playthrough is just difficult and unforgiving. Enemies are constantly 2-5 levels higher then you and you progress and nearly everything can 1 shot you without warning. In many cases the badass variants of enemies can be harder then the bosses of the area you are in. You will be required to farm xp and weapons quite often if you don't want to get constantly slaughtered in every area.  The NPCs are all rather limited with dialogue and quests. There are several good side quests, but most are very generic. The rewards from them tend to be average as far as usefullness goes... but some are just pointless.  While the previous titles contained a lot of humor that was easy to understand, the Pre-Sequel seems to have little to no humor without first researching what it is they are trying to make humorous. I did find a few rather amusing parts, but they weren't as memorable and laugh inducing as the ones in the previous game.  As others had mentioned, glitches and bugs are quite a problem... depending on what happens. I have been killed by nothing, been shot at through walls, and even been the victim of rocks/platforms that aren't really there. I have also been blessed to have a never depleting shield, one shotted some enemies that I know I shouldn't of been able to, and had enemies be motionless while I unloaded on them. It definately needs to fixing.  One more small annoyance I had... Bosses, in the second game, were a primary source of farming for legendary weapons and items. In this one, many of the bosses are one time only fights with no chance to farm them. There are still several bosses that can be farmed, but not many effective ones.  Now for some good things.  There seem to be more chests around then in the second game which in beneficial to loot farming. Getting to the few farmable bosses is a fair bit easier then on 2 as well. Farming said bosses can be challenging, but manageable when properly leveled.  The Vault Hunters' skills are all rather unique and can be quite effective in solo or multi situations. From Claptrap's randomness to Nisha's autotargeting, they all make for very unique characters.  Plenty of sidequests to do and a few easter eggs to find make it quite similar to Borderlands 2 in that aspect. It can be quite entertaining to find whole quests that are just easter eggs as well. :)   I suppose, overall, it is a good game in need of some work. Hopefully any future DLCs and updates will remedy most of it's current problems and make playing it a more enjoyable experience. I think, as it stands, I would give it roughly a 7.5/10.  I do like the game, it just needs work. But I would only recommend getting it after a bit of a discount as it currently is. Unless they fix some issues first.",

This game explains Borderlands 2 and Jack's rise to power very well so the game succeed's in it's misison to being a pre sequel.......BUT THIS COMES TO A HUGE WARNING FOR THIS FRANCHISE'S FUTURE! We are treated to more of the same game again here with little innovation (Apart from the fact your on the moon and some cool new gun types) ...everything else is the exact same. Don't get me wrong if endless gun grinding is all your after fine no problem but for a player who has put 100's of hours across all 3 games im starting to get bored of the same thing over and over...Im actually struggling to be bothered to play playthrough2 because of this. The game is becoming stale and needs some tender love to bring it back to fresh i hope to see that in Borderlands 3!  Things they can add or improve:  -More in depth skill tree  -More in depth characters (And customization) -Multiple special abilities to choose from at the beginning? -(MAIN ISSUE)- Make the game more interesting on multiple playthroughs...Just change it up playing Borderlands 2 again on the third playthrough was torture as the storyline is exactly the same and the missions are the damn same making the game boring to play again and again. This could be done by improving the choice decision on some missions and that choice completely changes the story and you could do that multiple times on one playthrough. Just please do something about this! -Bullet sponge enemies- I don't know about anyone else but i find higher lvl enemies (especially when you get to lvl 50) who can tank 100's of rounds and you are there for 5 minutes killing one guy a real cheap way of doing it. I would prefer slightly weaker enemies but way more of them to make up for it...This way it feels like the weapons you have looted are worth using and not peashooters as you will actually do damage and the game continues to flow well making it more enjoyable to play.  These are just some ideas i can think of. I will leave it to Gearbox...Just hoping this franchise continues :)",

Now before I continue, I am not comparing it to previous sequels which mostly carried over similar issue.  My biggest problem with this game is how it is designed. You can't lose in this game, every time you die you are respawned at near checkpoint. If you were fighting a boss and died in the middle of the fight, that boss is going to be at whatever hp it was when you died. You can't restart the fight from the beginning. It absolutely ruins any challenge and any sense of accomplishment. When I battle a boss I want to go toe-to-toe an beat it in one setting from 100% to 0, and not run back chirping away at his healthbar on every death. And if he beats me, fine, but I want to try again from the beginning.  On top of it game is hard. You will die a lot at least in the beginning. Some enemies have elemental damage which pretty much kills you in one hit. So a lot of it is reduced to: kill 5 guys, die, respawn, kill next 5, die, respawn, etc...  The story is absolutely a drag. Even Jack who was a blast in BL2 and supposed to be the most interesting character is reduced to a bunch of pointless one liners like 'go here' and 'do that' with occasional unfunny joke here and there. Other NPCs are even worse, completely unmemorable, and MMO-level bland 'quest-givers'.  Game does not introduce anything new. Laser weapons and limited oxygen could have just been a small expansion. And one of your main features is buttstomp, you know your game sucks.  Worst of all this game is just boring. Save your money.",

Comedy is the glue that binds a Borderlands game together.

Instead of smirking at a witty reference, I'm cringing a clumsy one, or a joke that makes no sense in the esablished context.  I also have some issues with the pacing, lack of diversity in enemies, fast travel locations, and other aspects of this game, but they're easy to overlook for me - the uninteresting writing is not.",

The skills in the skill tree change your actual skill pretty minimally and often your ability itself isn't that interesting anyway.  The playable characters that you can choose from are far less interesting than the ones introduced in Borderlands 2. The npc's in the game followed the same pattern of not being nearly as interesting as the ones that are braught to you in borderlands 2. The writing was poor, and the normal cringey charm that a borderlands gives off was completely missed on most of the characters in this game.  The Good: It was a reskinned Borderlands 2, so the gameplay itself was fun enough. The only thing that saved the game from being a travisty was the fact that Borderlands 2 was such a good game, and if you reskin an amazing game, it's pretty hard to screw it up too bad.

Ice/freezing is just a reskin of slag. You deal additional damage to frozen enemies, except they shatter to pieces if they were frozen mid-air and they don't move.  The biggest problem I have with this game is 'exposition time!'. You stand in front of a closed door and wait for some random character talking to you to open it. And authors love to drag on and DRAG ON this time by giving this random character like ten thousand lines of dialogue. And you ♥♥♥♥in' wait, because you know, you wanna just shoot things.  Yeah, story is cool and all, but let me listen to the dialogue while playing. You know, authors of Borderlands 2 made it so you can hear the dialogue anywhere for a reason.  I'm not the fan of enemy health scaling while playing with friends, but you can just get better gear... By farming and reading through the wiki which random enemy drops a gun worth using.

After beating the game, I discovered how much fun I had exploring, fighting, and looting my way through Elpis, the moon that the story takes place on. As usual in the Borderlands series, there were halarious characters and exciting easter eggs to be discovered. The main plot is about 4 mercanaries named Athena the Gladiator, Wilhelm the Enforcer, Nisha the Lawbringer, and Claptrap as the Fragtrap. All with unique personalites, each character that you can play as took a job by the contractor of Handsome Jack, a Hyperion worker who is significant in the storyline of Borderlands. Although Borderlands the Pre-Sequel's graphics were about the same as Borderlands 2, I did not find it bothersome, and the colors in the worlds I traveled in were rich and pleasing. New weapons, including cryo weapons (ice-like element) and laser weapons, were fun to use. Adding the 'zero-G' factor into the game really added a twist into the combat of original Borderland titles. One unique element of zero-G is the butt slam, a jump-crouch-slam technique that can throw off enemies allowing time to heal or recover from something. Multiple vehicles can be driven in the Pre-Sequel, including the standard buggy, now know as the moon buggy, and the Stingray which is a floating vehicle that also can butt slam in its own way. The story line was filled with infamous boss fights and daring challenges that kept me, the player, really wanting to keep going and strive for the best loot and inevitably completing the game. Here is the summary described as pros and cons:  Pros: 1. fun loot 2. great sories 3. new characters that add a funny yet satisfying addition into the game 4. epic boss fights 5. Zero-G (duh) and the butt-slam 6. rich color schemes 7. The Grinder, a new machine to combine weapons to make new ones!  Cons:  1. Anyone who hasn't played a Borderlands game in the might feel lost in the story line 2. side missions led you to the same places, and I wish they added a few more places to explore 3. graphics were about the same, but it did not bother me 4. a little more heads/skins for characters, but that can easily be added in  Overall, I did NOT feel that the game was rushed, like some people may say. A great 3rd game into the Borderlands series. I think they did a great job with the story and missions to experience and explore. Rating: 9.6/10 People New to Borderlands: 7.9/10",

The sidequests were, on the other hand, unfortunatly barely worth doing and very few come to mind that were humourous, creative, and original. Thankfully, there are some special weapons that are rewarded from some quests that make them doing worth while. Shame that was my only motivation doing them.

I found myself as a lazer-based class (Wilhelm) while buttslamming scavs from 50 meters in the air, and I enjoyed it quite a bit to say the least. Also, the option to use the Grinder, a machine that can combine items into something better, was a neat little addition to the game. A big downside, however, was the character skills. It felt rushed, unexciting, and focused more of co-op gameplay mechanics (E.g, Claptrap.) Not that I have a problem with co-op skills, it just felt punishing towards players who focus on Solo games rather than the Multiplayer, despite the fact that the franchise was largely known for it's drop in, drop out co-op. Borderlands 2 was fun for both Solo AND Multiplayer characters, and that is what I enjoyed most about it. Another downside was lack of respawnable bosses, which dimminishes the game's replay value with a single character. But I have spoken too long on the gameplay, so lets go right to the story.  The story, although stale at first, shines as being one of the more interesting stories in the Borderlands series. Regardless if you thought that Borderlands 2 was 10x better than the Pre-Sequel's, it was nonetheless enjoyable for me. It drove me to keep playing to see what will happen during the next mission. I wanted to see Jack go from Zero to Anti-hero. It was great, and the main protagonist dialogue was a treat as well, especially Claptrap's lines. As I stated in my first paragraph, the sidequests were forgettable and mediocre, which is disappointing for a Borderlands game. The humor gave me the occasional chuckle, and the rare 'LMAO' moment, while the rest were either unfunny, 'meh,' or even cringe-worthy. That is a big turn off from a series built on it's humor and clever dialogue.  The DLC is probably the biggest turn off of the series, and here's why;  The studio had it's plug pulled after the negative responses from gamers and critics alike over the game. Which is a damn shame, since the Claptastic Voyage was a gem to play, rivaling that of Tiny Tina's Raid on Dragon's Keep from Borderlands 2. If they had kept going and had more time to extend the life of the game, maybe, just maybe, they would have redeemed the game. At least the studio, despite their game being hailed as the most disappointing installment, went out strong, and I commend them for that. Sure, the rest of the DLC is 'meh' compared to Borderlands 2, but it is still worth checking out, along with the two Vault Hunter DLCs.  OVERALL:  If you wish to play a Borderlands game filled with mediocre humor, innovative gameplay, fun story but forgetable characters and sidequests, then this game will satisfy you until the next installment comes out. You may not spend as much time on this game as you did in Borderlands 2, but it will occupy you for a good 30-40 hours depending on your pacing ingame. I'd get this game on sale or at ♥♥♥'s website. Other than that, i'd wait until then.  Rating: 7/10, a game that lacks from the previous installment yet is enjoyable nonetheless.",

Pros: -It's Borderlands. -Story on the side of the bad guys, expanding lore, etc. -You can play as Claptrap (is this a pro or a con?) -New weapon type (lasers) -Handsome Jack is back (kek)  Cons: -It's Borderlands DLC @ $60 -Moonjumping = really annoying gimmick -Classes shoehorn you into playing a certain way, depending on what tree you take. Claptrap literally has a tree where it dictates what weapon you should be using. Bad classes -There's a season pass, so get ready to pull out another $33 on it.  Bottom line: Get it if you want more BL action, at least until BL3 comes out (hopefully that's not a trainwreck). BL:TPS isn't bad, it's just not enough to warrant a full priced game IMO. Putting recommendation as YES just because it's new dialogue and that tends to be the best part of BL anyway.",

I haven't finished the main campaign yet, so take this review with a grain of salt.  I will say this, however. If you don't like stupid, pointless, or redundant questing, DO NOT get this game. If you like 90% of your game to be fetch quests or 'hit this switch. Oh sorry, its busted, go over here and kill this thing. Oh that didn't work? Lets try some other stupid thing' then this is the game for you.  I LOVE Borderlands 1 and Borderlands 2 (though TBH the questing in Borderlands 2 had way too many 'filler' quests too) but the Pre-sequel is an absolute chore to play. The moon-jumping mechanic feels way more gimmicky than it should, the weapons are even less creative than the previous games (with the exception of the laser), the game environments are the ugliest in the series (This feels like nothing more than a glorified expansion to Borderlands 2).   The only thing this game has going for it is: Its relation to Borderlands 2, regarding the story, and the new characters. The new characters are pretty cool.  I'll continue to play through it once. But I will absolutely not be playing through the harder difficulties. The game feels like a flaming dog turd painted up to be a trophy.  This is one of the most disappointing games I've played in a long while. This coming from someone who has hundreds of hours in each of the previous games spread across multiple consoles. This game is crap. Stay far away unless you get it on sale (75% off minimum).",

I only hope they never let them do this again to any of their future games. Do not let the Aussies touch anything.  Biggest disappointment and something everyone misses immediately is the music. Borderlands2 had a fantastic soundtrack, everybody loved it and the music is still getting hits on youtube, and purchased from Amazon.  But the music in this game sounds like it comes from a ice skating amusement park, and adds absolutely no feeling to the game at all it's better to just turn it off.

The game is plagued with them.  Short, uninteresting storyline. The story has it's high points but all in all it is a yawn-fest. Several characters are thrown at you that you are expected to like despite how obnoxious or uninterestng they are.  Boring zones. Almost every zone is the same. You have space station zones and you have moon surface zones, that is about it. I understand that is where the game takes place but something to break the monotony would be nice.  Extremely long linear zones. Bloodshot Stronghold and the Bunker were awesome in Borderlands 2. There are also two things that made them successful. One: Areas like that weren't a large percentage of the storyline and Two: The missions had a halfway point where you changes zones. The Presequel has several missions that traverse long linear areas that have no stopping points. I don't necessarilly always have time while I am playing to commit 45 minutes to be able to accomplish something, because if I quit I have to start the whole zone over again. In addition when for example you get 3/4 through said zone and one of the Pre-sequel's many bugs hits preventing you from progressing you get to start the zone over again. Sometimes you get to start the zone over again 3 times before you can progress.  Unbalanced gameplay. From issues such as doing every sidequest available and then getting to TVHM and every mission is too high of a level for you to completing the game and going against a raid boss which you are repeatedly told you cannot solo or you will die, then soloing it easily.  Lack of comedy. I questioned throughout the entire game if something that seemed intended to be funny was due to the difference in culture from Austraia to America or it was just poor writing. Closer to the end does get better.  Lastly to reiterate..bugs. If they could make a patch to correct their unfinished game, I would recommend it. I do not in it's current form however.",

Come on people, HOW many you kept playing after your campain (except UVHM) in Borderlands 2? There was never much endgame (or at least fun and worthwhile endgame) in the second game until you got to UVHM, and that was you just killing bosses over and over until you got a legandary.  I've seen people hate on the oz kits a lot, saying that there is too much oz around for it to mean anything, and I've seen people say it's too stressful, but it all sounds so dumb to me. Unless you are totally blind, there is more than plenty of oxygen around to keep you filled, and while that might agree with the first point, I would rather that than to ave it be something stressful and tedious.   People keep saying how 'all the guns are copies from BL2!!!', and...yea..they are...why go through the hastle of creating even MORE parts and even MORE designs when there are already a trillion left from the last game.

It was made to give people who wanted more, even crazier borderlands 2, more borderlands 2. That means: the game is even crazier than the original but not as big or long, just like Blood Dragon was. The core gameplay is way more fun than bl2, the weapon system has better guns and doesn't make you save edit to get weapons that are actually useful. The movement system is wonderful. I've had about as much fun with this game than I did the entirety of bl2. It's priced the same, sure, and that's the game's biggest downfall, but as far as I'm concerned this 'pre sequel' is a spinoff that's made to be enjoyed alongside borderlands 2. The whole fact that the moon and helios was staring at you point blank in the face the entirety of bl2 really proves my point here. This was made for people that wanted a crazier borderlands 2 experience, and as far as I'm concerned, this game is worth the money for that alone.  There are a few drawbacks to this: 1. don't expect as much content or filler 2. the gameplay is way more fun, and the guns a better mixture of the fairness of bl1 and the coolness of bl2, but the environments and the game's length isn't as long. 3. People who wanted a true sequel were misled and as such this game may force people to give up on the franchise when really that wasn't the point of this game.  So in the end, is it worth it? Only time will tell. The fact is, at the current price, this game really deserves more dlc content. My reccommendation is, if you are on the edge, wait for a sale. The people who are playing it currently are the intended audience, fans of borderlands 2 that wanted more from what the game currently had to offer. Like Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon, or perhaps 4 with less content.  The main story takes around 17 hours to complete. Borderlands 2's was 34 hours. My point has been said.",

This game so far has been absolutely fantastic, and I hope it will finish strong. It is addictive, and sometimes annoying, but that is something that we have all dealt with in the past.

In the end I'll always think of the series as worth the hundreds of hours I spend on each one. However I do have to say that The Pre-Sequel does seem the worst of the trio. Borderlands 2 had literally days of content before the end, and almost more post game content even if you didn't buy a single DLC mission. Pre-Sequel is about half the length to get to the end even if you take your time and complete every mission, and with even less endgame stuff to enjoy after it's all finished. Also the enemies are kinda bland in this game, Borderlands 2 had an amazing repetoir of enemies to fight, from the lean and lanky psychos, to the heavilly armored and bulky marauders, the half mechinized Hyperion engineers, the shirtless badass bruisers or the hunched and hopping ratmen, and that's before you get to the non-humanoids. Pre-Sequel kinda has all the humanoid enemies all wearing the same black spacesuit, you can barely tell them apart until you read their nametags. And there are only 2 different non-humanoid enemies in the entire game.  But is it good? Is it worth it? Oh god yes. Even if it is 'more of the same' it's more of the same in the best way. You still have the amazing plot writing, the extremely fun running and moving, the bazilion weapons to collect and use which all feel drastically different to wield, and of course the versatility to create your own playstyle.  New in the pre-sequel include a whole new weapon type, or types rather considering that the new Lazer weapons are so varied in how they shoot that they're barely comparable. And the dropping of the overcentralizing Slag element in favour of the new Cryo element which seems nether overpowered like slag was in BL2, or useless like Corossive was in BL1. It gives a serious damage amp to your shots just like the aformentioned ones, but only to certain shot types, giving serious power to what would have been weaker normally. And the dropping of underwhelming relics in favour of fun jetpack-like Oz kits which let you do extra attacks and doublejump, speeding up your traveling across the map considerably. The new vault hunters are also very new with their own unique playstyle and skills to use, many of which are unlike anything which has come before.  I am going to sink loads more hours into BL;TPS before I do eventually go back to BL2, that's for certain.  Also you get to play as Claptrap... which is pretty neat.",

However, for someone who loved the second game, this is the perfect continuation of the Borderlands we know and love, and has plenty of new features and content to keep you entertained. The classes are characters this time around are a real step up, with much more interesting skills, skill trees, dialogue, and costumes. The storyline is even better than BL2, and all of the bosses are crazy, colorful, and a ton of fun to fight. Despite some returning items, much of the loot is brand new, and the new lazer and cryo weapons are awesome to play with. The vehicles have also been given an upgrade, as the Moon Buggies feature much more powerful armaments than the vehicles of BL2, and the new Stingray is a blast to fly around in. As of right now, the only real con to the game is the fact that some of the bosses do not respawn, and are therefore non refarmable, however, Gearbox and 2K have already said they recognize the problem and are looking into a fix for it. Beyond that, the endgame does feel a bit empty, but this is customary of Borderlands pre DLC, and what with Gearbox's reputation and track record for incredible DLC, I am sure this is a situation that will be speedily rectified. In all, this is an incredibly fun game, either alone or with friends. Veterans and fans of the Borderlands series will love this 'Borderlands 2 2.0', and for players new to the series, this is the perfect place to jump in and start exploring the rich world of the Borderlands universe.",

That being said, this game is very well-done and all you would expect from a Borderlands game. The humor is there, the plot gives GREAT backstory to Borderlands 2, and of course, there are billions and zillions of guns to check out. Sure, it might not have been as big or as good as Borderlands 2, but it is still an extremely fun and game well worth your money. $60 might be a bit much, but if it's on sale for $40 or even $30, definitely pick it up if you enjoyed Borderlands 1 and 2.   If you do buy the game, do NOT buy the Season Pass. The Season pass does not seem to be worth it; as unlike Borderlands 1 and 2, which included 4 Storyline DLC, Borderlands Pre-Sequel Season Pass includes character DLC and the level-upgrade pack, so just buy the Story DLC separately when it comes out.",

            "review_text": "Explosions, laser guns, space bandits and more all-around Borderlands fun! What's there not to like about Borderlands: TPS? Well, that depends on what your expectations are. I've finished the story and am about halfway through the TVHM mode. It has been a fun ride for the most part. That's not to say that there aren't snags in the game.  Lets start with the positives first.   WEAPONS: Laser weapons are generally fun, yet also feel somewhat underpowered. Some of the classics from Borderlands 2 return in some form or another. There is also a new addition to the game; The Grinder. Once you unlock this fine machine, you can feed it weapons/items that you don't want and in return, receive another weapon or item. It takes a little experimenting to get right but there is no guarantee that you will get something awesome.  THE WORLD: No more Pandora this time around. Now you are on the moon of Pandora, Elpis. I found Elpis a pretty fun place to cause mayhem in. It is also very colorful and varied for being a moon. Lord knows that this aspect could have been royally screwed but I feel that 2K Australia got it right. It's not as big as Borderlands 2 but is still a nice size and you could get lost here.  THE GAMEPLAY: If you've played a Borderlands game before this, then you know what you are getting into here. The gameplay is smooth, controls are responsive and it all comes together to make for a great experience. There are a few new aspects however. This being a moon, there is very little gravity and this was taken into account. You can now double jump, butt-slam and low-gravity just gives fights all new dimensions. Butt-slams are awesome and really helpful when you are surrounded by enemies.  VEHICLES: This is sort of a mixed bag. Vehicles are present in two forms; moon-buggy and some sort of hoverbike type of vehicle. The handling is the same as Borderlands 2. I can't complain about that but I know that a lot of people didn't like that. Genrally fun and good for long distances.  AI and ENEMIES: The AI is pretty much at the same level as Borderlands 2; sometimes it's challenging and sometimes dumb as rocks. The enemy variety could be better but I was satisfied with what was presented. I miss the bandits from Pandora; nobody wanted me to be their meat puppet.  Now for the bad:  The story is kind of short. Whereas Borderlands 2 was 17 chapters, this only has about 12 or 13, some of which are over in a breeze. It's also not quite as interesting as Borderlands 2. Some of the humor is also lost on people not familiar with Aussie humor. I missed that from Borderlands 2.  The world is not the biggest out there. It feels like they could have added a couple more areas to explore. Borderlands 2 was humongous and absolutely filled with side-quests but this is just not the case here. What's there is nice but it could have been larger.  To little side-quests fill Elpis. There are many sidequests but it feels like there could have been more and there are some parts of Elpis that just could benefit from something to do. Don't get me wrong, you should always quests to do but not in the quantity of Borderlands 2.  The last part is dedicated to the overpriced dlc. Ten Euros/Dollars for Handsome Jack!? Ten Euros/Dollars for one single arena that is being panned by everybody!? What were you thinking 2K? That's just too much and those that spent money on the season pass got royally screwed because those count as two of four items. I hope that the next two are worth it and better.  Overall, I'd give TPS a 7.5/10 and can recommend it. Just remember that it's not a completely new experience and many things are similar to Borderlands 2, as my many mentions of it show. It runs on the same engine so that is expected. Also, performance is generally great. If you can run Borderlands 2, then this will be the same.  ",

Although the story is shorter it still does a great job of filling in the story between the two original Borderlands games. I see a lot of reviews talking about the fact that not much was added to the game but here are some of the things that I personally believe made the game worth while. -Character interaction with NPCs.  -New storyline and interesting characters. -New movement mechanics. (Jetpacks, less gravity, ground slams) -Answers most if not all questions about the transistion from Borderlands to Borderlands 2. -Like Borderlands 2, a lot of easter eggs and new bosses. -Still provides the same comedic value and insanity from the playable characters and NPC's. (Although I think Borderlands 2 kept me laughing a little more.) Still the game has it's own issues. There are a few hidden bosses but nothing like Terramorphous or Vermivorous. There are some glitches with terrain and falling through the map but these problems will be likely fixed in future patches. I also see a lot of people upset with the fact that the game didn't really introduce anything that really set this game apart from the first 2. We have to remember that it is a sequel to the first 2 games. If too much of the game had been changed, it wouldn't be Borderlands.",

            "review_text": "Okay, let me just start this review by saying that I was very disappointed that you can't farm the bosses for their legendary loot. I feel this is important to say straight off the bat as it is one of my favourite things to do in the wonderful world of the Borderlands. I do not understand what the developpers are doing with this game. Maybe it's to bring in more cash through DLC or maybe they're not up to the standard we need. I mean people have used software like 'Cheat Engine' to fix this. So why can't the developpers.  So now let's move onto the game itself. I have to say that it is a lot of fun, however, it is definitely not up to par with Borderlands 2. The level design feels quite lazy as I often encounter invisible walls or death barriers in areas where there really shouldn't be. I find this incredibly frustating at times as I die for no reason. Maybe my Nisha character is allergic to the air - who knows? The low-gravity sure is fun on the bright side as moving throughout the map and jumping (or parcouring) is made easy by how high you can actually reach. The low-gravity also comes with the lack of oxygen which adds an exciting new feature to the Borderlands franchise. The oz kits are pretty much relics but with the added O2 capacity - I love this - and thus we can survive without oxygen for longer. I appreciate that when you run out of oxygen you don't immediately die but rather you lose your health gradually over time. It has been very well implemented into this game. Another disappointment was that there many returning legendaries from the previous game, and that much to my disbelief the 'Flakker' was back (yeah that weapon). It has been buffed though so I can't judge it just yet. The new legendaries are quite good such as the 'Excali♥♥♥♥♥♥♥' or the 'Shooting Star'. Although, the 'Shooting Star' has been nerfed it's still powerful. Oh yeah about the nerfing, Gearbox why do you have to ruin our fun? It should be our choice whether or not we want to play with OP weapons or not. It's not like we're ruining the game for others. Come one let us have some fun.   I will end this review by saying that I am very happy with the game. YES IT HAS ITS PROBLEMS BUT HEY IT'S SPACE!!! I highly recommend this game to whomever is fan of the Borderlands franchise but for those who aren't I'd still recommend it as it is truly enjoyable.",

PRICE: Is it worth £30 or $60 nope, no it is not it feels like a whole new game but it clearly is not i would say it's a very well made DLC not like Saints row IV that was a crap game and felt like a HUGE waste of money (coming from the person that got it the day it came out).  CRASHES: So far the game has crashed 5-10 times!!! in comparison Borderlands 2 almost NEVER crashes so i dont know what they did to make this happen. :(  OVERVIEW: The game looks and feels great they have turned up the bloom so i dont need to put SweetFX on this game whitch i love ATM i am playing as wilhelm and i love the way he has been made for the game. On the bad side how ever i would say that the Oz thing is cool for moving about but i felt that if when it runs out my HP should go down faster i always seem to find myself saying ''meh it's not like i'm going to die if i run out of Oz'' because you wont unless maybe if your in the midle of a fight but they made that imposible because ALL enemys drop Oz cans that refill most of you Oz.  so over all would i recommed that you get this game, yes i would me and my friend have had so much fun playing it so far.",

Low gravity and double jumping fun, especially in this setting. I felt the game made decent use of vertical space, there's generally lots to explore and find. The oxygen meter is a little off-putting at first, but once you start getting better gear it isn't that big of a deal. The map does seem smaller overall than the first 2 games, but there seems to be a lot less empty space as well, so it's all good.

            "review_text": "I guess this game can be summed up in one sentence: 'more of the same, but a bit worse'  I wanted to love this game, I really did. As a long-term Borderlands fan, I didn't want to accept that there was a Borderlands game that I didn't like. But there's SO. MUCH. about this game I don't like that I just... can't... bring myself to make this review positive.    I liked quite a few of the game's mechanics:    The gunplay and combat remains tight and engaging (although some enemies in UVHM - the third playthrough option - can feel like bullet sponges, where instead of intricate and challenging showdowns you're just holding fire until you win)    Character abilities are all pretty useful, especially Claptrap's now-infamous vaulthunter.exe, which is actually loads of fun and hella useful in certain situations   There's tons and tons and TONS of guns as to be expected (although some do just feel like retextured weapons from the previous games) and legendary weapon drop rates are quite high    There's more over-the-top characters and ridiculous (in a good way, promise) missions, particularly the Claptastic Voyage DLC which I'd recommend to hell and back if you're into Borderlands' recipe of what I'm calling 'serious silliness'    The dialogue between characters is pretty funny, and again there's pop culture references everywhere    Boosting around is admittedly quite entertaining for the first few hours of play    I LOVE the grinder. I think it's an awesome new mechanic that gives value to old, no-longer-needed loot, and often threw away stuff I needed at the prospect of making something even better   It's not a great game, however, far from it in my opinion;    Honestly, the main story completely failed to engage me. Most of the new characters are completely forgettable, and although I liked the development of    Jack and his transformation into Handsome Jack,    any mission not directly concerning this feels arduous and even irrelevant - there were a few missions I forgot entirely how what I was doing was relevant to the story    Returning chracters fail to add anything to the plot - I don't think any of them were utilised properly, and for the most part it feels like they've been cookie-cuttered into the story simply because they could be    The voice acting annoyed me for some reason. It wasn't the Australian accent thing (trust me, you'll notice 2K Australia played a part in this one), but most of the new voices and some of the returning ones    (ESPECIALLY MOXXI'S, RRRRGH SHE DOESN'T SHUT UP)    really tested my patience, especially when playing using headphones    As mentioned above, the low-gravity zero-oxygen gimmick becomes tiresome very quickly, when you realise you'll likely NEVER die from suffocation once you have an O2 kit as health drains so slowly you'd have to measure it's decline on a calendar, and oxygen filling points being as abundant as all sin, making 'Oz' kits an annoyance, not a strategy-changing mechanic. The 'butt-slam' (for lack of a more sophisticated term) is also woefully underpowered, and serves more as a way of clearing your path than a viable offence    I HATE THE DRIVING IN BORDERLANDS GAMES. I HATE IT SO SO MUCH. I've always hated the indescribably bizarrre vehicle controls and wonky, imprecise steering, and the gravity situation really doesn't help. The vehicles are too floaty, too fast and too uncontrollable, the steering (worsened no doubt by the gravity) is too wide, too weird and too inaccurate and you may as well just run/boost since most of the routes you'll be taking aren't too long    It... feels reall short. I don't know if it's because the side quests were really uninteresting, but the game felt like a less complete package, especially considering the contextually extortionate £30 price tag    I don't know why, but I just felt less compelled to explore than in previous titles. I felt like, since minibosses don't respawn, and there were no raid bosses at all, the risk of finding and fighting something that could kill you numerous times wasn't worth the payoff, especially when your loadout is mostly purple-rarity items, and you should never, ever, EVER feel like that in a game about exploring   Let me say it like this:   Did I enjoy this game? Yes, overall I was able to overlook the similarities and shortcomings (mainly because I wasn't prepared to accept I'd spent £30 on something I didn't like)  Would I recommend it to first-time Borderlands players? No. Go for Borderlands 2. Better story, better presentation, better combat, better DLC - better game, frankly  Would I recommend it to long-term fans looking for a fresh experience? Only if it goes on sale, paying full price like I did may set up expectations that ultimately won't be met  So yeah, Borderlands: TPS. More of the same, but a bit worse.  ",

I have a bunch of collectibles, Marcus bobble head, Butt Stallion Diamond Edition statue on the way, posters, the works, and I CANNOT IN GOOD CONSCIENCE RECOMMEND THIS GAME.   It is not a bad game, but it is super mediocre and it does not feel like Borderlands. There are a lot of good single moments, but these are ALL in SIDE quests (such as explaining the origin of Jack's invisibility and how Nakayama got a scan of Jack's brain).  CONS:  - Very few decent guns. There are basically threee good unique guns, and you get them after you are levelled up beyond them.  - VERY annoying characters. Especially Pickle and Springs. I have Australian friends, I prefer the Australian audio track of Mad Max, I am totally capable of understanding Australian linguo and accent. I have no idea what Pickle is saying half the time and Springs is an insulting caricature.   - SHORT. Of all three games, this campaign in the shortest, and that's saying sometihng considering the next CON.  - You are locked in to dialogue. In the previoous games, you could continue down the road while everyone talked about the quest. In Pre-Sequel, you are stuck and cannot continue for as much as 10 minutes while characters talk to each other about crap that doesn't even matter. You do not get a waypoint and often you are trapped in a room with nothing while this goes on. In the words of Tiny Tina (who only appears via narration) in the second playthrough of the game, 'Uggh, so much boring talky talk, get back to the shooting.'  PROS:  - It fills in the story of what happened to a few things that didn't make an appearance in BL2. A few things.  - The Claptastic Voyage DLC. This is really the only reason to get the game and is what the main game should have been.  And that's pretty much it. There are only a couple fun quests.",

I didn't pay any attention to the loot like some of the other reveiwers here have so I can't say how close it was to the loot from BL2.   The Good Stuff:  Butt slams are freaking awsome! Definatly something that falls into the keep that feature catagory.  Skill tree balance. They totally improved the balace on the skill trees. I played as the commando in BL2 and had to pick some skills I really didn't want just to get to the ones I did want. In TPS I played as the enforcer and I have to say I have a hard time deciding which skills to take.  The Grinder. This thing is extreamly useful. Another thing that falls into the keep catagory.  The Bad:  Walking. The areas are freaking huge and you end up walking for like 70% of the game. Which wouldn't be bad except all of the areas are the size of some of the bigger ones in BL2. Totally kills the interest in the game.  Mobs. I play solo 99% of the time so when I walk into an area and shoot one guy and get mobbed by 10 more at once and 2 more waves with no breaks I get a little frustrated. Especially when I repeatedly go into Fight for Life or die.   The DLC. This is really frustrating to me. I pre ordered the game with the season pass anticipating DLC on par with both of the previous games and instead I payed 30 bucks for 2 characters, an arena and a half baked campaign. I don't know about anyone else but I just about finished the claptrap DLC in something like 5 hours. Now I know its a DLC and its not going to be as long as the original game but seriously 5 hours! Thats a bit nuts. Especially for a borderlands game. Addmitadly I was over leveled when I played it but only by 5 levels at the start of the DLC campaign and maybe 7 by the time I finished. However when I did the same thing for the DLC campaigns in BL2 it still took 10-20 hours to do everything in the DLC. The amout of time I spent on TPS's DLC campaign is about equivelent to the amout of time I spent on 2 of the headhunter campaigns in BL2.  The Useless:  The lazers. I really wanted to like the lazers but they don't really add that much to the game for me. I would much rather Gearbox kept the cryo wepons and ditched the lazers. Not the most popular opinion but there you go.   I really don't know what I'm going to do when BL3 goes up for pre order. I want to keep loving BL games but if the next one is anything like this I may have to find something else. In summery TPS should only be bought at a discount.. like 35 bucks and under. If you do buy it I would avoid the DLC unless you absolutly have to have it. Save the money and use it for BL3 when it comes out. This is a thinnly veiled reskin of BL2's engine and most of its guns.        And yes I realize that I am not recommending the game and continuing to play it. So I'm a bit of a hypocrite... Suck it.",

Pros: I like the class abilities more than the previous two games. Butt-slamming (chuckle all you like) is really fun and effective when done properly. (chuckle some more) Lasers, albeit the only new weapon, are really cool. The best thing about the Pre-sequel is the grinder. Being able to grind 3 purples, cross your fingers, and possibly walking away with an orange is pretty cool.  Cons: It's too short. I was only level 25 when i beat the game the first time and that's including all available side quests. The space IDEA is cool, but causes two big irritations. I like to explore and with your O2 meter constantly depleting, it seemed like i was always running to find O2. Also, you tend to fall into lava and/or chasms on a pretty regular basis just trying to get from point A to point B. Lastly, there really isn't a very diverse number of baddies, which indirectly leads to a little bit of gameplay imbalence. I never had the need for a corrosive weapon, for example.",

At this moment, this game not worth $60 for any player expecting a fresh borderlands title. However future updates will likely improve the game so it is on par with Borderlands 2 quality. Currently, this game lacks a way to reset the story and side quest; making farming and replayability impossible without starting a new character.   Story: In actual time, this game takes place after Borderlands 2. One of the four new vault hunters, Athena, tells the story that took place between Borderlands 1 and 2. For any hardcore borderlands fans, this story is particularly important to understanding Handsome Jack’s viewpoint. In fact, if one would have never played borderlands 2 to witness his actions, one might feel sympathetic to Jack as he is the victim in Borderlands the Pre-Sequel.   Gameplay: Overall feel in terms of gun fights is identical to Borderlands 2. Many legendary items have been recycled from Borderlands 2. Classes are unique and well done; each having their own personality revealed as the game progresses. This explains a few of the bosses you face in Borderlands 2 and why they sided with Handsome Jack.  Nisha = Sheriff of Lynchwood also Jacks girlfriend in Borderlands 2 Wilhelm = Boss that appears in Borderlands 2 after the train crashed when you are in search of a power core. Claptrap and Athena are the only characters who left Jack’s side at the end of this game.  Hopefully new updates will bring this game on par with Borderlands 2. Right now this game is not worth $60 unless you are a hardcore fan of the series.",

The first thing you notice is there's less class choices this time around, plus there's no real dedicated character types like before. (There's no dedicated sniper without buying a DLC and as far as I know there's no Gunzerker, unless Wilhelm is half engineer/gunzerker)  I found it slow going at first, getting used to the oxygen and low gravity, but it soon picks up and you get access to the main city early on. The major drawback of it being on the moon is that the environments are very similar and can become tiresome. The vehicles are ok, I find the hover bike completely useless and a real pain to try and use right. It doesn't lift with boost just stays up longer, so you sort of have to boost after going off a jump but not too early or you'll fall to short!  The enemies in the game are extremely limited compared to BL2, their really all just phycho's in spacesuits. A lot of boss fights are plain and almost normal but with a few special moves thrown in and there’s no real special mechanic to beat them. Due to the length of the game (very short compared to BL2) you really have to grind levels later on in the game. It seems to take ages to get towards the end but then you seem to face a lot of bosses back to back and wonder where the rest of the game went.   P.S. I don’t know if it's linked to 2k Australia developing it but there's a lot of Aussie's on the moon!",

The Pre-Sequel is aptly named as it isn't quite a true sequel to Borderlands 2; the game's mechanics, graphics, and even items to some extent are all the same from Borderlands 2. However, for someone who loved the second game, this is the perfect continuation of the Borderlands we know and love, and has plenty of new features and content to keep you entertained. The classes are characters this time around are a real step up, with much more interesting skills, skill trees, dialogue, and costumes. The storyline is even better than BL2, and all of the bosses are crazy, colorful, and a ton of fun to fight. Despite some returning items, much of the loot is brand new, and the new lazer and cryo weapons are awesome to play with. The vehicles have also been given an upgrade, as the Moon Buggies feature much more powerful armaments than the vehicles of BL2, and the new Stingray is a blast to fly around in. As of right now, the only real con to the game is the fact that some of the bosses do not respawn, and are therefore non refarmable, however, Gearbox and 2K have already said they recognize the problem and are looking into a fix for it. Beyond that, the endgame does feel a bit empty, but this is customary of Borderlands pre DLC, and what with Gearbox's reputation and track record for incredible DLC, I am sure this is a situation that will be speedily rectified. In all, this is an incredibly fun game, either alone or with friends.

Cons are expensive DLC for really mediocre content, really short campaign, the inability to farm bosses (that in itself is almost a deal-breaker), and the fact that this game could have really used more depth.

            "review_text": "First of all, Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel is PRETTY much the same as Borderlands 2. There are differences here and there but ultimately if you enjoyed Borderlands 2, you'll enjoy this one.  That said, here's what's different, divided into Good additions and Bad additions.  GOOD: - The Stingray handles much like the sandskiff from the Captain Scarlett DLC in Borderlands 2, and it's definitely the best way to get around. The 'pancake' ability is mostly fluff, but it's fun early on when it can actually kill things.  - O2, surprisingly enough, isn't that annoying to manage. It ends up getting refilled constantly during battle since enemies drop O2 canisters, so it's only something to worry about when traveling, and even then if you run out you suffocate really, really slowly. Butt-stomping and jetting are fun additions, and Claptrap doesn't breathe, so you can play as him and mostly ignore the whole thing if you want.  - Cryo weapons are lots of fun, and replace Slag as the 'increase all other damage' element. Freezing a flying enemy and watching it shatter when it hits the ground is always fun.  - True Vault Hunter Mode doesn't just repeat the same flashback narration, but actually has new dialog. Which is better than the first playthrough.  - Legendaries can be found much more frequently in vending machines, meaning you're certain to pick up a few just through normal gameplay, and provides more use for money.   BAD: - The Moon Buggy handles like a drunk elephant. Once you unlock the Stingray, don't look back.  - Quest givers are scattered all over the various maps, so Concordia doesn't act like a hub as much as it should. BL2 had you constantly returning to Sanctuary to turn in all your quests at once.  - Similarly, quests will send you back to previous areas that you've since outleveled, making them into tedious chores. It's like the Matchstick quest in the BL2's Flame of the Firehawk quest chain, but repeated multiple times.  - Pickle. God damn Pickle. He won't shut up, and is representative of a recurring problem in the game in which NPCs blather on for WAY too long while you're just waiting for them to open the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ door or let you hand in your quest.   NEUTRAL: - The writing is much patchier this time around. There are plenty of excellent jokes, (TOOOOORGUE!) but you also have some really painful exchanges, (particularly those involving ♥♥♥♥ing Pickle,) that fall completely flat.  - The Grinder will eventually be your primary source of Legendaries, but by eventually I mean once you've hit the level cap and are able to farm bosses for lots and lots of moonstones. Until that point, it's a fun diversion that will occasionally give you something good but mostly will just spit out crap.  These are all essentially nitpicks, though. It's Borderlands. I like Borderlands. I like this game.",

If you gonna bring back mostly old legendary's , why not ,idk ,BRING ALL THEM BACK. but you know gearbox logic. 'let's bring back the kurbblaster, that was a fan fav!' Also the lack of end game makes the game bland as there are no weapon to farm becuase of non-respawnable bosses. The dlc is horrid with only a character and a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ survival dome.

If you're already a believer, on the other hand, you'll only find more to love.  DLC is more or less mandatory though, and the season pass is another $30. Moving from BL2 with its 5 campaigns total and 72 levels of advancement to a single, rather short campaign, 50 levels, and no UVHM feels like a forced step-back to squeeze our wallets and make it easier to pump out a quick release.

The story is enjoyable as you watch Handsome Jack change into the villian seen in Borderlands 2. While some complain about the slightly shorter story, I personsally liked the shorted length better. In past Borderlands games, I have felt like the campaign just dragged on and lost all charm. With this game, I felt the campaign was the perfect length, leading me to actually playing though both the regular mode and the true vault hunter mode. In my opinion, the base game is the pinnacle of the series. The dlc is another story. This game lacks the phenomenal extra dlc packs that past borderlands have had. In fact, their has not even been a major one yet( the claptrap dlc comes out soon so I am hopeful it will be great). I still recommend the base game though as it is phenomenal!

I've also heard complaints that the game is 'too short'. However when I was playing just before I found a hidden area with easter eggs. Exploration pays off and 2K Australia have done well to concentrate on the quality rather than pandering to those who have to play the game straight through as fast as possible. There's also some hilarious social satire here as well as an Australian theme (happen to like Australians so your milaeage may vary). What more can I say ? Bottom line for me is that I'm very impressed by the quality here of design and of course overall - *FUN*. The best way to play is just to play rather than stopping to analyse anything. Have fun !!",

            "review_text": "I would recommend this game, if it was around 10-15 euro.  Paying 50 Euro for a large DLC that has a campaign about the same lenght as any DLC for BL2 is ridiculous. The same reused objects, scenery and even background characters is just plain lazy. The game can have a nice, colorful, saturated atmosphere and good effect on the player. If you enjoy space atmosphere, the worldbuilding and ost is not bad at all. In fact, I found the space atmosphere quite enjoyable. New gameplay techniques including double-jumping and slamming and a new vehicle are just.. not enough to justify this being another part of the series.  The writing is just.. well, we're all glad we are not Anthony Burch. I mean, after I've heard 'I'm a lesbian and not into guys!' the third time I was thinking; If this was written by a lesbian feminist, I'd understand, but why the hell is a guy writing this. He can hardly write a geniune womanly characters, let alone amusing characters. The characters and jokes are barely funny, the constant lesbian remarks are boring and poor (no, if there was a guy and he was constantly saying 'hmm girl you look nice id like yur number' that would the same kind of boring and poor. IT IS NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE WOMEN, IT IS BECAUSE THEY ARE STUPID AND SHALLOW). Plus I don't see how you're fighting social justice by pushing it into everyones face, forcing them to accept your opinion. By the least, the development of Jack into vilian was also very forced and didn't feel fluid. From the begining he was psychopatically enjoying situation where he got shot at and where he shot others, giving players little to no possibility of sympathizing with him. And, you know, he's the main character of the story, you.. should be able to sympathize with him even though he's an antihero. It worked in Breaking Bad. Everyone loved Walter and still realized he's doing psychopatic stuff rising from his ego.  tl;dr Gameplay-wise: The same as BL2, now with double-jumping and slamming. It works and it is fun, but hardly anything to justify this being a new game in the series, so 5/10 Atmosphere-wise: Colorful, nicely made scenery, good OST, but the graphics are still pretty much the same, so 7/10 Story-wise: .. well, I'm just hoping Anthony doesn't write anything more. 2/10  Overall: 4/10 . Almost OK game, would buy for 10 Euro, can't recommend for the current price. I bought it on sale and still have somewhat of a buyers remorse.",

I played the hell out of the second game, and given that I expected TPS to be more of the same, I’m surprised that TPS didn’t grow on me more. TPS works on the same, successful formula – but it’s just too much of the same.  What to say? It’s Borderlands 2 with low-gravity, the same lucklustre plot and familiar enemy types. The low-gravity doesn’t make itself felt other than providing you more vertical routes throughout the game. The use of oxygen mechanics might as well not exist for all the difference it made to my gameplay.  Then the guns. Of course, it’s unfair to expect that what’s essentially another Borderlands 2 expansion pack will have as many guns as the second game, but the paucity of unique gun options was disappointing. There are some familiar favourites (the Quasar and Rolling Thunder grenades, the suicidal Nukem launcher, the pointless Invader), but if I wanted a rehash of BL2 weapons, I’d play BL2. There are the new Laser weapons, but my inventory just became inundated with them about halfway into my campaign. When everything’s a Maliwan-barrel laser beam that burns through ammo at an indecent rate, I start craving a simple sniper rifle or shotgun. They’re good, no question, but there was too much of it.  Essentially TPS suffers from the same things BL2 did. Perhaps playing so much of BL2 worked against me. I put down the second game having squeezed every drop of enjoyment out of it and had NO further desire to continue. Here TPS returns with exactly the same mission types. Go here – retrieve this or kill that – nearly get yourself killed – return. It was a formula that was tolerable in BL2 when I was new to the franchise, but it just doesn’t work on someone who’s played too much of BL2. TPS became a slog way before the halfway point.  Then there’s Jack, whom I was hoping to like more. I liked him in BL2 and was hoping to get more insight into why he became a murderous, flaming ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I enjoyed him as a villain but I’d have loved to sympathise with him as a character.  There isn’t any ‘why’ or ‘how’. Jack just IS a murderous, flaming ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. There’s no expansion at all on the details uncovered in BL2 about Jack’s wife and his daughter, Angel.  The plot hopes to explain Jack’s descent into insane megalomania. It doesn’t. Jack starts off with the appearance of being a harmless, bumbling idiot (his idiocy was reminiscent of a typical Claptrap unit) but he doesn’t really come across as being a hero at any point in the story. His desires have always come across as purely selfish. Even the ‘turning point’ (it seems), when he kills a familiar face and enjoys it, doesn’t come as much of a surprise. Borderlands is a bloodbath and always has been. The idea of Jack being a ‘good guy’, in any sense of the word, was dull and honestly, quite inconceivable (yes, it means what I think it means). And Jack is reduced to simply having been ‘good’ and later, ‘bad’.  Yet, on further thought, Jack isn’t even what I’d call evil. Callous, certainly, but he’s more of a bored child with big dangerous toys, too many lives in his hands and a very deadly sense of humour. Perhaps “childish” is the best adjective, really. The idea of descending into evil doesn’t really work in a game-verse that utilises black humour (somewhat) and trivialises death. Yes, Jack killed some of his old partners and develops an obsessive thirst for revenge. But who in Borderlands isn't a murderous madman?  And that’s Borderlands: TPS in a nutshell. “So what?”  Play it and forget it.  Rating: 5/10",

This issue spurs from the idea that Borderlands Pre-sequel is supposed to be a long game, This issue spurs from HOW you play the game, I played through the first time doing every single side mission as well as the main quest line and finished the game in about 16 hours. Therefore if you just focus on the Main Quest line then of course your game will take less time and you will miss out on important character Development on Jack, Which is the WHOLE point of this game.   On another note, This gameplay is wholesome and accurate, There have been complaints about the use of the same UI for players, but honestly I LIKE that Gearbox kept the same UI because there was really no issue with it during the entire Borderlands 2 playthrough.  “If its not broken, Don’t fix it!”  The game has a lot of progressive factors, The use of low gravity seemed like a shaky idea but Gearbox pulled through and gave the player more control over movement and actually did a pretty damn good job at making the low gravity not interfere with gameplay and give a pretty beneficial aspect to the game that is often done incorrectly or just wrong by other game developers.  The characters are also very improved, there has been both incorporation of your character into the story and subtle dialogue differences that occur with each character.  If you are going to complain about the vehicle controls then you should just realise that this control is equivalent to each of the other games in the series.  The overall story of the game does a very good job at filling the gaps between the two games both incorporating past events on Pandora and allowing the players from Borderlands 2 to connect to future events that will have happened during the future game. The portrayment of Jack is especially well planned and expressed, no single event seems out of place and can connect to the larger web of events that ultimately develop Jack into the character that you remember from Borderlands 2. There is a development of Jack through events that cause the Hero Jack to become the Villain that is depicted in Borderlands 2. Now this does NOT mean that I solely like Jack as a villain, Jack plays a strong role as a hero within the game and is just as likeable if not more so overall, now that we have seen the two different and dichotomy-esque sides of Jack.  On a personal note, I appreciate Gearbox for the further explanation of the story of Jack who is arguably one of the best villain-esque characters from any video game, movie, or book that I know of.  10/10",

If your a die hard borderlands fan I highly recommend picking this game up if it`s on sale simple for the story. It reveals all the events that occured after borderlands 1 leading into 2 and gives you some insight into the mind of JACK. If you haven`t played any borderlands games and are interested in playing them I would not recommend picking this title up as your intro into the borderlands series. I would have to say start off with 1 or 2, but would definitely say Borderlands 2 since that one is my all time favourite and with all the dlc`s borderlands 2 has it will give you hours upon hours of enjoyment.",

I would HIGHLY recommend that you don't purchase it if that's your platform of choice.  I loved Borderlands 2, and was incredibly excited that they released The Pre-Sequel for Linux.  That said... the game suffers from random freezing/stuttering. Ever so often (as frequently as every few minutes) the game will just freeze for several seconds. If you're hosting a game, the rest of the players can run around without you. If you're not hosting, you just lose out. It's frequent enough to make the game overall painful to play. Large portions of the game are based around jumping in low gravity... which doesn't work so well if your game stutters and you fall to your death.  There's no solution to be found, save for MAYBE disabling multiplayer, which evidently works for some people. Of course, then there's really no point to playing the game.  The stuttering occurs everywhere, even when all assets should be cached and the computer isn't taxed at all... like the main menu.  There's no way this ever should have been released in this state.  The game otherwise is OK. It's not fantastic like Borderlands 2 or really anything new, but it's fun to play with friends (or would be aside from the issues noted above). It doesn't seem to have the lasting appeal of Borderlands 2 either, though that impression may well be colored by the game being rendered borderline-unplayable by freezing.",

First yes you may play Cl4p-Trap so that's a good point for the game but it is not meant to be the character amateur players can use. it is by far the hardest to use. While Athena can get behind her shield, Willem can send his drones and Nissa can shoot her way out of tricky situation Cl4p-Trap is not guaranteed to have a useful Power sometimes it just turns against you. Yes I loved that but I imagine that for some that's neither amusing nor intriguing.   Secondly People will argue with my first point saying there are five more characters to play the game with. Yes but no! There are only three more characters to choose from and two more if you bought them separatly or via the season pass. For me this is the biggest problem. 4 real DLC and two more characters was a reasonable package for the price of the BL2 Season Pass when it came out.  This time it is only two real DLC and two more characters including the worst archetype of the entire Borderlands History. Yes I tried to like her but the Baronness is just horrible unfunny and tidious! Some people may enjoy her but not me!  The season pass were the same price when they came out! Is it just me or this last sentence sounded like 2K saying 'We got a cult license they'll buy it no matter what!'   My last trouble is with the Maps. By far the worst map imaginable even First Borderlands maps were less frustrating to rewalk! The lower gravity and oxygen packs helps but it is not enough. I did the playthrough 2 times with 4 different characters and crossing Veins of Helios gave me nightmares each time I knew this moment of the game was approaching.   Bottom line this episode is fun and engaging but only worth buying when largely discounted.  But remember only buy it from Marcus' machines otherwise he'll have you killed!  Playing this game at least answers the question why 2K Austalia closed shop...  Happy Hunting",

It has a lot of similarities, for example The UI is the same as the UI from borderlands 2, and some of the legendary weapons from the second game actually make a comeback into the Pre-Sequel (The Sham, Whiskey-Tango-Foxtrot, The Maggie, The Cracked Sash, The Neogenator, The Quasar, The Leech, and the Badaboom just to name a few). However, the Pre-Sequel also adds a new weapon type, lasers, into the game, and adds a new element as well, called cryo. While the story isn't as amazing as Borderlands 2's story, you still get to work with Jack before he became Hyperion's CEO, and get to watch his slow decent into the power hungry villain that most people are familiar with from the second game. The Pre-Sequel takes place after the first Borderlands but before the second, however you should still play the second game (and maybe the first) before playing this one, as many, many refrences to things that happen in Borderlands 2 are explained in the Pre-Sequel (the origin of Hyperion's Robot army, The creation of the constructors, and why Jack wears a mask). There are a few glaring problems that the game has, most notably Pickle (he's a ten year old NPC you meet in the game and he is TERRIBLE.) and low gravity. Due to the fact that the game takes place mostly on Elpis, Pandora's moon, you will be jumping around at low gravity for most of it. Some people like the Jumping around at low gravity, but for the most part it's just 2k's way of adding more depth into the game, which doesn't really work effectively. overall, the game is a solid 7.5/10. I'd say buy it, but only when it goes on sale.  (By the way the Claptastic Voyage DLC is amazing, you should definitely get it!)",

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.  Eat.",

First i'm going to explain a little backstory, if you just want the pros and cons just skip this, it explains my history with the Borderlands games.  I have been a fan of Borderlands since i first played the original game with friends, i moved to Borderlands 2 and played it alone at first, it was a horrible experience. Then later on i bought a friend the DLC and played with him and had loads of fun, and continued to play with others as well. I then went and replayed through the first and second game on stream with a group of freinds at  www.insomniacgamers.net  and it was a blast. We looked forward to play through the Pre-Sequel together.  Now lets get o the pros and cons. Pros:  -Like Borderlands 2 but in space. -New weapons and items, the grinder was interesting but limited. -Some backstory to events in Borderlands 2 -Claptrap -Characters actually respond to whats going on.  Cons: -Everybody sounds the same, everybody but previously known characters are australian. It gets on your nerves eventually. -Story felt like the beginning and end were thought out but everything inbetween was thrown together at a moments notice. -Claptrap -Too many badasses, if everybody is a badass then nobody is a badass. (maybe this is because group of 4 but thats the point of playing this game) -At first audio clips would cut off other audio clips, might have been fixed but this is how it was when i streamed it.  Now you may think 'This has more negatives than positives, why is it a positive review?' That is because its a fun game and i would play it again if only the a quad claptrap group. I feel the negatives do stick out more but they arent as bad as they at first seem. What i do hope is that the DLC makes up for the lackluster middle of the game. It had a lot of potential but was limited by the small feeling world and the voice acting being one accent throughout the entire game.   I would say a good price to buy this game is anywhere between $30 and $45, it didnt feel like a $60 game or even a $50 game. If you want more Borderlands 2 but on the moon, albeit an australian moon, grab some friends and you are going to have fun.",

Especially when a lot of the skills in different characters have added benefits when paired with a co-op partner.

I was so excited for the new BL game to come out, I didn't think that Gearbox would let it just die like it did. Pros: -I really liked the new gravity and oxygen dynamics, they made combat more interesting for a little bit. -Talkative characters. Having the correspondence between the Vault Hunters and the environment was a nice change, and you could see in BL2 that they were trying to make this more of a reality in Tiny Tina's DLC with the Vault Hunters having small moments where they responded to the narration. -Good story, playing as the bad guys helped to further the whole 'moral gray area' idea that BL presents.  Cons: -The gravity dynamic was fun at first, but got old in the further levels of the game. As well, it was unpredictable and inconsistent, and caused a lot of unnecessary death in trying to explore or while driving. -That thing where they arbitrarily shove as much social justice into the game as possible and expect it to be okay. (ie. too many homosexuals, killing people for being intolerant, extreme bias, making jabs at the player, etc.) I could understand a subtle prod here and there, but all out revealing that you're nothing more than tumblristas in a half-done game seems like a dangerous move when no one is excited for any other developments you have on the horizon. -Too short. It was about half as long as BL2, and shorter than BL1 by a long shot, so I barely even had time to get engaged with the story. Also, releasing a short game isn't always a big deal, but when it's a game where most players expect to be buying DLC hot off the market, the game should be longer than a DLC itself. I'm glad that I only spent $30 on this during a sale rather than the whole 60. I would rather have bought it as a DLC for 2, and paid the same amount. -Not really worth the time. Yes, it works as a nice segue into Borderlands 3, but besides that, it was tedious. Traversing the moon was fun, but then you discover it's barely big enough to actually call exploring. And, above that, I had no motivation to replay the game because I just didn't care enough. I won't be buying the level cap increase, as there's not even enough to do in the game to get to level 61. And even if I did get to that level, I wouldn't want to play an empty game with no farmable bosses and hardly any loot. -Boring enemies. All the enemies are the same, and all the creatures are annoying. -Australian accents are not that funny, nor is their lingo, it got played out very quickly. -The whole story is supposed to revolve around Athena's retelling of it to the original Vaulters, but I played as Wilhelm, so it was a let down to feel like my character isn't even involved in the cut scene after the final boss is killed, or in most of the actual story besides his little conversations with Jack. -Plot holes. Why even make Felicity able to talk? She was worthless to the story, could have just used any old AI rather than present it as an important character, then drop it from the game entirely.  There's no way to fix this game without completely redoing the story and making it longer, less SJW, and maybe using some diversity, so there's no way to fix it. I don't want to wait till BL3 comes out to care about this franchise again, so maybe there should be some free DLC released, or make the DLC's that inevitably come out last 15 hours each.  Overall, 6/10",

Especially Claptrap's action skill. + Not sure if it's just me, but the game feels more optimized than Borderlands 2. I think it runs better than BL2.  - The level design. It's often just bland or confusing. - The same problem as with the earlier game: the game is somewhat repetative. Many side missions are boring. - The characters are fun to play as. But as characters, they are not very interesting and BL2 hero group was better IMO.  TL;DR: If you enjoyed Borderlands 2 and want more, buy this game.",

It feels cheap and untested for the majority of its game play and has quite a few outstanding issues: Geometry problems (vehicles going off the map), mobs shooting/running/flying through structures and various terrain glitches just to name a few engine based issues. I personally on SteamOS have problems with some Guns' rate of fire suddenly changing in the middle of a fight for no apparent reasons. For the AI, enemies love flying and they also love getting stuck while flying or they just stop doing whatever they were doing to give you time to shoot them down. (pretty)  This release of Borderlands also adds a few mechanical gimmicks, the main one being the low gravity and the absence or presence of an atmosphere. Unfortunately it just doesn't work very well, Your character is supposed to benefit from the low gravity using an Oz kit. Using the Oz kit you can apparently fly, move quickly across terrain etc... This is probably true, if you are an enemy. You on the other hand don't fly or move quicker. It feels like you're stuck with Marry Poppins' Umbrela and all your enemies have Tribe based jet packs. The low gravity/lack of atmosphere thing ends up turning combat into Stay Puft Marshmallow Man vs An annoying bunch of prepubescent kids.  Combine the slow motion fights with the few vehicles in the game and you've got quite a contrast and it's not to say that vehicle combat is any better. In most fights with vehicle weapon systems, you can stop, aim, put the vehicle in reverse, step back a little, aim, kill and you're done. The combat is just massively disappointing in Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel. It is slow and not exciting at all.  A few reviews out there have been stating that level design is confusing, well I disagree. It's just dumb. So if you approach levels the dumbest way you can, you shouldn't be confused at all. One of the most frustrating feature from these levels is how checkpoints are distributed and how some of it forces you to walk an entire map back if you die while others are right next to each other.  Really disappointed with this game, I was expecting better quality, but it looks like it was basically thrown out to fans just to wrap up the Borderlands franchise. I'm happy I got the title at a discount and I wouldn't recommend this game at full price to any hardcore Borderlands fan.",

            "review_text": "Played through it blind while clearing all side missions; took around 17-18 hours, post final story mission. It's okay. Spoiler-free below.  If you want to learn more about Handsome Jack's origin story, this game provides context. Other than that, it didn't feel as fun or relatable as Borderlands 2. A lot more female characters and accents this time around, yet none of the characters really stood out. I played through Athena's story, and it felt lackluster. Then again, most, if not all, character back stories in the Borderlands lore are lacking.  Oxygen system felt more of a nusciance than anything else. Didn't experience asphyxiation at all during the game, but the system just felt annoying. The majority of the game is spent in low gravity anyhow, so oxygen is somehow relevant? Speaking of, with a lot of the game in low gravity, a lot of the movement comes out slow and floaty. Even though Borderlands 2 had this, its more prominent in this game. Be expected to spam double jumps and slams just to seem fast.  Mechanically, without slag, there's less reliance on damage amp and moreso on various effects. There wasn't a time when I was boned without the proper elemental effect, because the game does its job on making sure you're not without the right elemental type. Quests will allow for fire/cryo/electric/etc. weapons if needbe, so there's no need to hunt for a certain element.  The map definitely feels smaller this time around, and to get around this, the side quests feel heavily back-tracky. A lot of the time, side quests will pop up in areas that you've already cleared in the main story, multiple times. Not much to explore, so might as well do it repeatedly. With a lack of multiple TPs in areas, I saved, quit, and then resumed a lot just to hop to fast travel points. Sucks, but beats having to jump all over the place.  If you're a fan of the series, play this for continuity. If you enjoyed Borderlands 2 for the writing but not the overall series for the world and lore, skip over this.  Also, laser OP.",

All the voice actors are lazy and unoriginal, the characters rarely follow you, even though they talk to you as if they are standing right next to you during missions(pickle). In borderlands 1 and 2 no one has an accent, in this one, everyone does. They make jokes and references that make no sense to the rest of the world and most of them are repetitive and annoying. The game is short, the maps are tiny, the mechanics are silly and make no sense.   The oxygen system is pointless and just makes you play the whole game with a sound warp and color filter in slow motion while you fart out double jumps and never have to actually worry about running out of air.   The levels are full of non-collided models and invisible walls. The city and station feel empty and bland. There's no fun easter eggs or pop culture references like Borderlands 2 was full of.   The vehicles are pretty pointless on the tiny maps and can only be used for a short period of here and there.   The monsters are just massive, slow, boring beasts that you fire non stop at for a while then move on.   The final boss plays out like a SNES game. jump, dodge, shoot, jump, dodge shoot, swipe, jump, shoot, done.   YOU DON'T GET TO BE A PART OF THE FALL OF NEW HAVEN** Despite how important that battle and loss is to Borderlands 2 and how much time you put into it in Borderlands 1. It is only casually mentioned once, and you never see or do anything with it.   The story as a whole feels broken and detached from the main game. Why is there a lost fleet? Why is an alien with them? Why is it so easy to kill in the end when at the start of the game it is basically a god that can stop bullets with the wave of a hand?  The characters were so obviously pulled from BL2 that they left in a WHOLE VOICE LINE from Maya using her ability. Didn't even bother to check the sound files before release.   I tried to like this game, I really did. I loved Borderlands 1 and 2. I like Gearbox. But 2k Australia really fell on their face here.",

            "review_text": "Imma be a little generic here: Like everyone else says, this game is worse than BL2. HOWEVER... However, there are upsides.  Pros: -The classes: the classes in this game are honestly much more creative than in BL2 (exception, Krieg; Krieg was pretty unique). Example, Claptrap. Claptrap was the support character no one needed but even with that you still probably wanted to play him, thanks to his zany ability to be a 'Vault Hunter' using Vault_Hunter.exe. Wilhelm was like the Axton of BL2, but with pets that actually were useful and took the advantage of flying 24/7  -The weapons: not the actual weapons themselves, but the ease of access to higher ranking weapons. Also the lazers, which honestly IS a fun addition.  -The gear: as much as the Oz kits and system is nothing spectacular, the actual usage of them, personally, was much grander than the relics in BL2. This would have to be because they actually needed in active role in using them, making you much wiser to what you would put in that slot. Shields were subpar but I'll get into that in the 'cons.' Grenades really added nothing new until you got legendaries. Lengendary grenades really amped the field. While not superior to BL2 grenades, however superior to BL1 grenades, they were fun to use with their (sometimes) randomness.  The Cons: -Shields: this is touchy, since shields in BL2 in late game get iffy and less reliable. The shields seemed to decreases in quality, though being more combat effective. A good purple shield would do you just as good as the legendaries I've gotten my hands on, unlike in BL2 where the shields showed drastic change and had importance.  -Late game/Aftermath: this is simply  *Two bosses, one of which is just beating the end boss again (sorry for minor spoiler)  *One story DLC (which I will not remark on as I don't own nor seen it)  -Story Bosses: this may just be me, but the story bosses you encounter get substantially harder and more co-op intensive. And while I love playing a good co-op match, I'd like to be able to fight bosses on my own and not die many many many times (on the first playthrough at that!) No spoilers, there is one boss where the best way to win is standing on a cursed platform hoping to get hits off at it... super... slowly...  Overall Thoughts?: Overall, yeah I would recommend this game... if you're already a fan of the franchise. As everyone else who recommends this game, play the other two first. Become a fan or else you might end up hating this game (and the franchise which is good as a whole, honestly) and therefore wasting money.   PS(Unrelated to being a review): I'm ALWAYS open to playing a good co-op match in this game, so feel free to invite me if you do buy this. Completely willing to start a new character too for those wanting fresh playthroughs. :)  ",

The story isn't as good and I don't like most of the characters as much, it still is a Borderlands game, so if you enjoyed the previous games it'll probably not be a deal breaker for you.  I like the gameplay/combat better in this one. It's basically identical, except for the addition of the double jump/boost and ground slam. I loved running around and boosting in combat or just slamming on the ground and disrupting enemies. These are the only things I missed when I replayed BL2 again after finishing this game.  The different classes are alright but I didn't really like playing any of them for a longer time, except for Athena.  All in all, if you played the previous games and liked them, this entry won't offend you, but if you're just getting into the series you might want to start at a different point.",

I have played way too many hours of Borderlands 1 &amp; 2 that I was confident I was making the right choice to play this one.  Now, I'm not so sure. It just seems that there are a lot more opportunities to die in this one. I don't mean getting killed by the opponents...that's 'OK'. It's getting killed because you fell or jumped wrong that bothers me. It really sucks the fun out of it.  Pros: - It's Borderlands! IF you have played the others, you know how to play this. - They introduced the oxygen limit. Not a biggy, but it does give you some extra incentive to move through an area.  Cons: - They have made this a 3D platform game. There are too many timed missions (side missions, thank goodness) But, other missions require timing jumps and such. Fail and die. Yes, there are LOTS of them in the OTHER games, but at least you don't die if you fail. - Timing is WAY too critical. The first time I got the Stingray I thought it would be great to jump. But, it's almost worse than the moon buggy. I died countless times trying to jump a gap to get to Dave. - Navigation is poor. I thought it was very neat when I got to Concordia and they displayed some waypoints to show you how to get to the roof; later in the giant spaceship you end up going 'off the map' to get to where you need to. And you have to repeat the process several times. Sometimes it was not clear that you had to go north to go south! - Voices on the characters were VERY hard to understand. I turned the music way low so I could hear the characters, but finally had to turn on the subtitles to figure out what they were saying. - I ended up dying a LOT. Probably about 100 times more than I did in the other Borderlands. It's way too easy to jump a bit too far and plummet to your death - especially INSIDE the spaceship. - I spend too much time going to the web trying to figure out how to get to the next part of a mission. I should be playing, instead. - They kept the same 'Badass' rep from Borderlands 2. Sure, you can turn it off, but then it's off for ALL of your characters. I really like the way Borderlands 1 did it; the more you used a particular weapon type the better THAT character got with that type of weapon. Made a lot more sense.  Still, after getting through some of the ridiculous jumping and timing missions (YES, they ARE optional missions for the most part) I have enjoyed playing the game again. Sort of a half-hearted recommendation, I guess. But, I'm too much of a diehard fan to let dying bother me.  Now, after playing even more, it's just not as fun as the first 2. Changing my mind again as I just want it to end. The others I wanted to keep going!",

It's fine humor, just most of it was 'Hey, Elpis is Space Australia!' which wears thin after a while.  -Some of the characters got turned Australian and speak like an Australian, regardless of them being American, notably Jack. It bothers me, but if you don't care, sure, whatever you like.  -Some characters are flat-out detestable. A lot of the characters are just mean-spirited and hateful. Some are just punch-a-hole-in-your-screen annoying, most notably Davis Pickle, the 10 year old Australian Stereotype space snitch who uses what I can't say is Australian lingo, because I've never heard a single Aussie speak like him. He's annoying to listen to and I don't find him funny at all.  -Forty dollars? You're kidding, right? No? When Borderlands 2 is a better version of the same thing for half of that? I don't care how recent your game is, that's massively overpriced, for what this game is. Don't buy this game full price.

The low gravity makes combat far more dynamic than in BL2. Now you have all three dimensions to maneuver in, making combat interesting,  Do I want to jump over my enemies and attack them from above?  Do I want to evade my enemies by jumping to vantage points and attacking them from there?  Or do you just want to run up and slam them away with the new slam mechanic?  Not only that the environments are more dynamic. Air is a resource that you must keep an eye on making some situations more intense then it would be in BL2. Also you can use the environment as a weapon. And I’m not talking about ye olde explosive barrels. You can shoot the enemies air supply and cause a suffocation DOT.  As for elemental gimmicks, fire will do big DOT damage if the enemy is in Air, and then we have Cyro, the best element in Borderlands history!  Know what was fun about slag? Nothing. I HATED always having to tug around a slag weapon in Borderlands 2.  To me, being forced to use a gun I don’t want to use, slagging the enemy, and then switching to a gun I actually want to play with is not fun. (True you could argue this is only required in Ultimate vault hunter mode, but that’s where the real game is at.) Know what is fun? Freezing your enemy, and them punching them in the face and watching them shatter into a million pieces. That’s Cyro. The freezing element that is one part crowd control, one part melee wet dream. I have over 210 hours on BL2 and so far NOTHING is as satisfying than freezing a badass and then robot punching them in the face with Wilhelm and watching them shatter.  As for the world… Pandora felt too much like Earth. You could replace all the alien animals with Earth animals and you could totally fool someone into thinking the game takes place on Earth. Elpis however… feels truly alien.  Also I found the character Wilhelm interesting. The more you level him up in his cyper commando tree the more robotic he becomes and his voice even changes. I have never seen that in any other BL character. (Physically changing as you level them)  Also laser weapons are etech weapons except they don’t suck and come in 4 different forms. (Assult rifle, ghostbustery beams, sniper, and shotguns)   So…  Pros  -3 dimensional fighting  - environments are fun to fight in and the O2 mechanic makes you more aware of your surroundings - Running around a low gravity moon is fun -Wilhelm (200 of my hours were just on him)  -Cyro being the best element ever.  -lasers!   Cons - Far less content than BL2  - Not as hard as BL2  YES BL2 is the better game because of the content, BUT if you compare the games at their cores, Pre sequel is superior with my opinion.    ",

Being a fan of Borderlands (owning all the games and most of the DLC's) I was quite hyped to play Pre-Sequel, expecting more of the great times I had while playing BL1&amp;2, however, I honestly struggled to enjoy the game at first, being on the moon, the story not pulling me in (well, not straight away) and I finding the default four characters to be boring, and having no friends who wanted to play the game, made me walk away from the game for a long time.  However, After a long time without paying attention to the game, and during a steam sale, I saw the 'Handsome Jack' DLC, which being a fan of him, I paid and tried again, now having a character who intrested me and had a decent skill tree (for me) made the game playable, and once you actually get a little ways into it, it does become enjoyable and the story picks up (tho the end boss to me just felt...kinda weird and out of place for some reason).  Without going on too long as I have a habit to do, I'd say this game is fun, enjoyable and still has enough of a Borderlands feel to it, but suffers from the whole 'moon gameplay WOO!' vibe, being away from Pandora and the characters we know and love hurt the game in my opinion (and the new characters bore me SO much, wanted to tell Springs to bugger off many a time), the story does give me enough insight into Jack to be enjoyable and kept me from not recommending the game. (I always feel though that if a game NEEDS a DLC to make me enjoy it, its not doing good enough in the first place.)  Overall I'd say if you really love Borderlands or don't mind it being a little less intresting than the other parts of the series, grab it and have some fun, getting the DLC's helps improve the game IMO, but I'd only recommend this game when its at least 50% off, not worth the full price.

There's nothing ground breaking here but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Abilities and classes feel better flushed out and unique. The low gravity makes walking around much more enjoyable. Some of the additional backstory on characters keeps the story interesting.   I'm more frustrated with inventory management in this one than the previous 2. Previously they allowed weapons/items to be marked with star, X, or nothing, they got rid of X. Sounds minor but this has been incredibly frustrating for me because of how I deal with inventory. While the inventory management has always been bad, being able to make star = keep, X = sell, nothing = I haven't reviewed it yet. That way I can quickly go through items and know what I need to compare and when I go to sell I can easily sell it. Without X, effectively I can only mark what I want to keep. Meaning I can't tell what I want to get rid of vs what I haven't compared yet. So I compare once when I get new gear and again before I sell because I don't remember if the nothing marked ones are all ones I wanted to get rid of or something I haven't reviewed.   Other than that, I have some minor gripes but they don't hugely distract or frustrate. If you like Borderlands, you'll like this one.   ",

Well let me tell you there are an absolute crap ton of guns, and grenades. 3.DOUBLE-FREAKING JUMPING, ohhh do I LOVE this feature. 4.LINES OUTSIDE OF COMBAT. I absolutely hated the fact that in BL2 you only ever heard your character speak during fights; in the prequel though, each character reacts differently to different things throughout the game, they actually seem kinda human for once. 5.The result of all these combined allows for one H#!! of a good time both for missions/story AND the killing of the enemies that gets you through to the end; hence my label for this reward 'cuz I regularly hear that line in my head....",

I have probably had more then 2000 hours on all the borderlands games. The first one is my least favorite in the series. ( I know thats weird) The second Borderlands hold such a special place in my heart! I have beaten the second borderlands, i think more then 17 times, all characters maxed out. When Gearbox annouced this game I was super excited, to bad I couldn't get it at launch due to money issues. I have to say this is my favorite of the series, the characters you can be the weapons and just the story in general is mind-blowing. Handsome Jack is hands down the best villian I have ever seen in a video game, to watch him as a hero and slowly turn into a villian is amazing.",

Yeah i agree with most of people that this one isn´t as good as Borderlands 2 abd that Borderlands 2 is much better but still a really good game. I didn´t expect the same, neither a better one i just expecteda good game and it gave it to me. It has instesting plot, funny and well made characters, good playabilty and a lot of others good things. Even though it´s not even close to what borderlands 2 was (which is my favorite game), it´s a really good and awesome game.  While Borderlands 2 was 11/10 this is 8/10 in my opinion. I recommend it. I could mention a lot of others pros and cons but the most important are: Cons: 1. The side quests are dull compared to the ones in Borderlands 2 2. The raid boss is lazy. Is just a harder version to beat of the final boss, which was really interesting but not enough to be repeated as a raid boss 3. Is really short compared to the first ones 4. Even though the DLC of claptrap is really good, it´s sad that they didn´t bring up more. Pros:  1. The vault haunters are more interesting that the previous ones. I say this because they actually talk this time and have some influence in the story (not like a lot but is something) 2. I really liked the open ending. I could say that Borderlands 2 had a bit of an open ending (with the map of the vault) but this one was more interesting and left you with a lot of intrigue. 3. You can see the backstory of Jack and how he becomes who he is in Borderlands 2 and I really liked that. You see how he slowly goes from a regular guy, with some issues but nothing out of this world, to the psychopath he is in Borderlands 2 4. BUTT SLAMS!  This one: 8/10 Borderlands 2: 11/10",

However, it's incredibly rare that I revisit a game and find myself  really  enjoying it upon trying it again. I did about 1.5 playthroughs of the Pre-Sequel (which is kinda funny, since the game is '1.5' in the series, so there's that), and simply did not enjoy the game. I thought it felt like Borderlands 2 in a crappy setting, and never wanted to play it again. Someone insisted he wanted to play it again, and, wanting to have something to gripe about, I offered to play through it with him so I could complain about the game some more. However, I ended up doing three whole playthroughs of the game, and would like to do more.  What changed? The only thing I can think of that's any different is my expectations...and I didn't play as Claptrap. Although a lot of people find him annoying as a character, period, I actually really like him. However, as a vault hunter, I didn't like his skill tree all that much. Of course, my half-playthrough was as Nisha, and I think most people enjoy playing as her, so I don't know. As for my expectations, though, Borderlands 2 had an amazing plot compared to Borderlands 1, and the maps had a lot of environmental variation. In The Pre-Sequel, however, the moon is rocky...all over. There's not a lot of map variation, so that is still a negative, and the plot, though decent, wasn't as good as Borderlands 2.  Gameplay-wise, though, I played through the normal difficulty and True Vault Hunter mode with Athena, and the normal difficulty with the Baroness (DLC character who makes cryo element wonderful), and  loved  my time as them. Their skill trees and skills were a ton of fun, and the guns in this game are great, because...well, because they pretty much did copy-paste everything from Borderlands 2 about the guns, then added a laser gun type and called it a day. The low-gravity jumping and quasi-double-jumps were fantastic, and I would actually love to see something like that in the next Borderlands game. Although a lot of stuff felt lazy in his game because it's identical to Borderlands 2, getting new vault hunters, a cryo element that's way better than the slag element it replaces, and various nice gameplay features make this a really enjoyable game.  It's rare that I change my mind from severe disappointment to high appreciation, but it happened here. Thank you for existing, The Pre-Sequel, and I'm sorry I hated on you before. &lt;3",

The game is... well, it's good. But its good because Borderlands 2 was good, and this is basically Borderlands 2 with a scant few additions, a much smaller amount of DLC, and a different, but related, story.  In conclusion, I really mainly recommend this game if you are really interested in the lore of Borderlands 2 and wanted to like Jack, or at least see how far he actually fell. Spoilers: It wasn't that far. But farther, maybe, then it seemed at first. So yeah. Buy this game on sale or something.",
