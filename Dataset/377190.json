            "review_text": "I am a tester for Pale Echoes and was provided a copy for testing purposes.  Pale Echoes takes RPGs and gives it a little bit of twist.  Combat is very paper / rock / scissor-ish as you have to find out what works best against certain enemies. You gain 'memories' as you play which act as additional characters during combat. Each memory has separate abilities which provide ways to heal, buff, or damage in battle. Each memory can only be used once per battle and if you run of out memories then you have to restart the battle again. Combat takes some getting used to but once you get the hang of it then it becomes second nature.  Aside from combat what makes the game interesting is not just the story but the perspective of how the story is told. Your character is the last surviving human who is recruited to help restore the world to a better place before it's destruction.  Overall the game isn't too difficult and the normal playthrough can take about 3 hours beginning to end. Additional options for playthrough are Dev commentary, Plus Mode (standard playthrough with all memories unlocked), and Perfectionist mode (which involves selecting the correct memories in an exact order to win).  This is a game that shows despite using stock RPG Maker resources you can still have a great experience.  If you are a fan of indie games this one is definitely worth looking into.",

            "review_text": "While it's an interesting story, and the fighting techniques are quite unique I did find one thing very annoying.... I couldn't adjust the resolution of the game. It came up in a tiny window on my screen and I had to adjust the resolution of my screen in order to make it bigger. There should definitely be some controls for making the game full screen built into the game. Also the movement is bound to the arrow keys instead of W,A,S,D, and doesn't allow for mouse clicks to make the game easier to navigate.   I do plan on putting some more time into the game to see more of the story, but I hope the developer will address these issues eventually to make it a more enjoyable experience. Otherwise the story and world development, and the mechanic for going back and forth through memories is quite enjoyable.",
