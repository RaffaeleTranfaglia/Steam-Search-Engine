To be honest, I'd love to keep this game, but only if it's price tag would be a bit lower, probably simmilar to Invisible Apartment Zero. I'm really sorry to say, that I requested refund, but that is the simple truth, while it pains me to admit it... While I would recommend this game, because the writing is excellent, it has it's flaws, still saying 'yes' on recommendation. If I knew this, I probably wouldn't request refund, but I didn't, and that made all the difference.",
