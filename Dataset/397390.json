            "review_text": "This game is a refreshing change of pace, and if the cool game mechanics and adorable graphics aren't enough, the game has a fantastic sense of humor regarding everything from the planet names/descriptions to the cards themselves.  HOWEVER, there are a few key facts you need to know before you buy this game, because its light-hearted tone and deceptively simple mechincs don't adequately prepare you for how challenging the game can be - even on the easiest setting. Let me share those with you:    Expect 'Very Bad Things' to happen to your crew  every single turn . Sometimes you get lucky, but don't count on it.   Deck building isn't just about  adding  cards. You need to aggressively use every job and item card you can to remove excess cards for  every  character's deck. Keep your deck small. Don't keep cards you don't want to draw often.   The types of cards you want will change over the course of the game. Don't be afraid to destroy expensive cards when they're situational or you just don't use them often.   Some of the expensive cards are really, really bad. That's probably intended, so you have interesting choices (instead of leftovers), but don't let them fool you into keeping them.   Actively swap cards among characters. Getting rid of a card usually  helps  that character - especially if the character who receives currently has a way to destroy it (think beyond the Chef as card destroyer)    'Research everything' is not necessarily a great idea. In fact, this can actually create a lot of problems.    Sometimes, it's a great idea to destroy a job card.   With that in mind, I guarantee you'll have a blast touring the universe in your comedy-rich food truck - especially if you have other people to play with.",

            "review_text": "Great stategy game that is WAY better with friends (if for not other reason that it's more fun when there are other people to blame when everything goes wrong). Not NEARLY as hard or as RNG-based as a lot of people seem to think, but it DOES require a good bit of strategy if you want to do will without RNGesus' blessing. Basically, if you like deck builders, this is a game you should buy. If you have friends who also like deck builders, you should ALL buy this game ASAP. You'll have a great time.",

            "review_text": "Read through some of the negative reviews and realized that 99% of them are people looking for an easy, 'please hold my hand', 'I don't know how to deck build' kids. This game is insanely fun and exciting while also being surprisingly relaxing.   There are 4 roles, The Captain, The Chef, The Scientist and The Engineer. Contrary to really any of the negative reviews, all the classes work very well with each other and the game is not overwhelming.   The Captain's main job is to move the ship and refill the ZapMart. You should expect to move the ship each turn you can, as keeping the ZapMart full and stocked is important to getting utility cards and food cards. Use your investigation cards to plot a safe route and save some events for emergancies i.e. don't travel to Handy Man planets if you have full shields!!! Another thing to remember is that while that's your main job you have a secondary 'ghost' job which is to oversee the ship. Consider putting 3-4 Diplobots on the Captian to keep the 'Crisis' events in check and not get out of hand.  The Chef is reasonable for cooking the meals! You need to collect whatever ingredients are needed for the 3 meals. You have to cook each meal in order but you don't have to turn in any of them to continue, in fact you can cook all three and then drop them off. In the beginning, you should grab all the ingredients on the Chef, later after you get your Free Samples and Discard Dives you can afford to have others grab food that you can take later. There is a second job that is probably almost as important as the cooking and thats burning cards. Consider having the Scientist research Flambe's earlier and grab Gamma Toasters and Burnilizers whenever you can. It makes it easy to have the Chef burn all trash and grab more trash from others. THIS IS LITERALLY THE WAY YOU KEEP DECKS SMALL. Anyone who complains about the decks getting to 'big' obviously doesn't know how to play the Chef.  The Scientist on top of being one of my favorite roles, is important to unlocking more cards for other roles. It seems simple and for all reasoning it is, but its also sort of a guessing game. You start off with one 'node' unlocked in each role and for every node unlocked the cost goes up. In the beginning you should be pumping AS MUCH power as possible in to the uncovering skill card so you can see all the nodes (this is important since they are in a random order each time). You should try to get the Chef's Flambes, Engineer's Wrenches and Duct Tapes and The Scientist's Breakthroughs and Mimic Cubes. On that point... The Mimic Cubes are AWESOME! They allow you to make a temporary copy of any card in anyone elses hand non-job related. This as allowed me to Mimic a Powerr Glove to draw two, to get a Claw to grab A Claw Of Duty from discard, to get another Mimic Cube to Mimic an Exchangetron and push him over 20 power and 15 worth in one turn... It's just crazy. It reminds a whole helluva lot of playing a simple Blue Mage from MTG. In fact, I'd surprised if the guy that worked on The Scientist wasn't a Blue Mage player :P  The Engineer is one of the most crucial jobs and yet kinda boring. It's not a bad boring, just wish he had something else to do. He really only has one job and thats to repair stuff... which breaks, a lot. You have Wrenches, Duct Tapes, Upgrade Ship and Exterminator cards. The first two give you repair points to fix shields, broken lab equipment and busted doors. The Upgrade ship allows you to iincrease the max shields and FTL drive by one point in one or the other. This becomes a relatively useless card late game when they are both maxed out and you can even burn them at that point to save space. The exterminator card allows you destroy Vexels, which are cards that get added to players decks (through a random turn event) and while they are in your hand they only give -1 Worth. 2-4 of them isn't a huge deal, but anymore then that and your average worth starts to decline and they just become annoying. The Exterminator card (theres only one) can only be gotten from the Scientist, so grab it fairly early to mid game to keep ahead of the Vexels. Other then that, make sure you put AT LEAST 4 Claws Of Duty on the engineer, as not having a Wrench or Duct Tape on a round that had a lot of damage or breakage can be quite bad and possibly make you lose.  All in all, this game is super fun, can be relaxing and forces you to work AROUND the RNGesus not against him! This game can be hard and yeah, sometimes you're going to get Life Support breakage, Xanus attacking, Shields deplete or pay 4 power (which you probably won't have on that guy) and Cyber Punk all in the same round. It will ♥♥♥♥ you off and you may lose, but just try again! I love what's in the game so far and can't wait to see what DLC they add! More cards? More Roles? Maybe Themed Galaxies with corresponding events? All that and more please!   Either way, this is worth $20 and if you still are 'sold' then wait till a sale. If this game goes to $10 and you don't get it then you never wanted it in the first place!   9/10 - The Engineer could use more fluff. -YeOlePopoff",
