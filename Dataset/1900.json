I only played Earth 2150 back then, but then I heard about Earth 2160 about 6 years ago and decided to try it. To my surprise, it came out to be a fantastic game. Much better, than its predecessor, the 3D setting of this game is quite revolutionary for a 2006 strategy game! I love it! And the gameplay? Amazing! You can customize your units as you wish, give them many different weapons, and level them up. Though, there are some unsatisfying things. When playing against the Alien race, the LC faction is quite weak against them. The second thing - you can't really tell what damage you are getting from the aliens... I tried all kinds of armor against them and none worked... Also, it seems like the shields aren't doing their job... they SHOULD absorb all kinds of damage... and not let any projectiles or beams through... so devs, PLEASE, patch these glitches to perfect this game! It's already a beautiful game as it is, and I STRONGLY RECOMMEND this to any RTS lover! Enjoy! :)",

It has great mechanics ,the 4 factions are completely different which is just awesome ,3 different recources make the make even more fun. The only 2 things I don't like are: The graphics ,well it's an old game so the graphics are obviously outdated but for some people it may really feel annoying (Not for me though) , the second problem is that basically ,there's not tutorial whatsoever ,you should have to practice and discover the game yourself through skirmish mode. (As I did) Hell ,you have to make your own units as one of the factions which is great but might be really REALLY hard for beginners. Overall a decent RTS game!",

            "review_text": "a rather cheap and amazing game all 4 races fight and play entirely different, each race harvest 2 out of the 3 resource types, this allows for some diversity among the factions.  The UCS are a faction that is entirely populated by machines, there entire army is mechanical walkers that are usually in between the speed and Armor of their enemies. The UCS build a central hub and attach 4 other buildings to that structure their mines are built as a refinery which sends out termites that harvest metal and crystal.  The LC are a faction who ever soldier seems to be female, their vehicle style is entirely hover tanks, the fastest units in the game but not very armored. their buildings are built on top of one another as towers, while their mines are planted by the resource and mine directly from it, harvesting crystal &amp; water.  The ED build by connecting each base to a central hub, this provides their bases with a decent defense, their vehicle style is tanks they are usually the slowest but have the best armor. The Ed mine by using mobile miners that just sit on the resources harvesting metal &amp; water constantly.  The Aliens, are an entirely mobile and aggressive force moving from resource site to resource site absorbing a different resource depending upon what breed of alien is feeding, to allow them to grow in-strength and size. they don't build a base instead their morphidian units clone themselves after absorbing enough water, or metal or crystal. this also allows that unit to then evolve into a new breed of Alien soldier or vehicle equivalent.  overall a good game although still slightly flawed but the only flaw with 2160 is they took out my underground bases from 2150..",

The mechanism to collect the provisions is also cool and interesting, even though there is not much to this.   The game plays well and looks well, so why the negative recommendation? Well, the drm is pretty bad and pretty much spoils the entire thing. If you can, somehow, endure it, then, well, you may as well buy the game, since it is pretty cheap and you can get for a pretty cheap price in a sale. But only do that if you really want to try this game.",

I'm big fan of the series, but honestly, I can't say many good things about Earth 2160. pros: + graphics + return of infantry units + experience is gained by pilots rather than vehicles cons: - balance (Morphid air fleet is virtually indestructible) - cliched story (in E2140/E2150 story didn't actually matter, in E2160 we get mix of all sci-fi movie themes you can imagine) - pitiful voice acting (actors don't even pretend to try) - missions ('good old' objectives like 'get from point A to point B' or 'gather resources and wipe enemy base(s)') - 'improvments' to good ideas from E2150 (research tree now fits into one screen, too bad it looks as if someone barfed on the screen, different armour types introduce mess and confusion rather than diversity) - soundtrack (it isn't bad actually, but there are very few tracks that are faction exclusive, it's huge step backwards compared to Earth 2150) - activation (it kind of made sense when game was released, but now it's just ridiculous, on the other hand - LC campaign is broken and, as far as I remember, multiplayer servers are down, so going through activation process is pointless) - AI (I was playing last mission in ED campaign on hardest difficulty and I was surprised how AI was 'sending small groups of units to certain death', in the same mission AI ground units were getting stuck over and over in narrow valley)",

            "review_text": "I've played the old 2150 series (Escape from the Blue Planet, Moon Project &amp; Lost Souls) and I really wanted to like this new part of the earth series ... Sadly that's not really possible. Maybe I'm overly nostalgic from what earth 2150 has and 2160 hasn't but even as a fan of RTS games this game feels very halfhearted.   1) The Unit Editor  This is why the Earth series felt so unique: Build your own army, by picking a chassis, add weapons &amp; shields and voila. Earth 2160 even added a few extra features. Now you can add engines, armour as well as gimmicks such as auto repair drones.   In the old Earth games, shields kept you alive deflecting plasma or electro canon fire. Now armour is way more important than shields as most weapons simply bypass shields. What sounds like a great feature simply turns the game into a game of rock, paper, sicssors, lizard, spock. Either your army wipes the floor with your enemies or they get crushed within seconds. Reload, build units using other armour and try again.   Once you get to the enemy base, the game really starts showing you the middle finger. Almost all weapons have reduced damage against buildings and if you don't want to get shreaded by basic defense turrets you'll need artillery units to slowly tear the base down bit by bit. Remember how much more fun it was to have your army charge in and blow up buildings? I do -.-   2) No Mainbase / Veteran units  Remember when you could do research between missions at your mainbase? Now you'll have to do all your research during missions. It helps that each research center you build no longer gives a timebonus, but instead allows simultanious research yet in the end you're just waiting for new chassis to unlock. Very boring.  Veteran units you can take from mission to mission can no longer be picked by you, instead the game apparently randomly chooses units from previous missions as starting units. Granted, each unit now has a pilot who earns the XP and can be placed in another vehicle, but it's just not the same.    3) Hero Units  I loved 'Fang' from the previous games, so I was curious how this one would play out. Fang was pretty OP, but not as OP as the new hero units in earth, that can take out armies without breaking a sweat. Not to mention the horrible dialogues and voice acting. No idea why the games doesn't pause during dialogues *or* why I can't control units during this blah blah *or* why everyone wants to talk during attacks.    4) Bugs bugs bugs  I was stuck on a mission because I've taken a different path to my objective, not triggering a dialogue. Still not as fun as watching my units drive right next to the enemy before opening fire or simply not attacking at all despite 'follow enemy' settings and being under heavy fire. Also why does my hero move in slow motion sometimes? No idea.",

Oh and throw in awful music, and especially awful one for main menu theme' &lt; sounds about right.   Earth 2160 throws series back to the same pit of crap they crawled off while they were transitioning from 2140 to 2150. Don't get me wrong, tunneling system aside - 2150 weren't anything special either, really. It basically completely ripped off warzone 2100 just like 2140 ripped off c&amp;c.

To get 'the full experience' the game has DRM that requires you to manually type in a 16 character Key, enter your name, address, and pc info, then write down and track some access code. Fun start. Presentation is kinda cruddy, though, it's an older game, so I don't expect the best graphics, but older games did a better job with what they had in my opinion (intro video to ED campaign looks fake, talking characters are just jabbering their mouths in animation). Pathfinding is non-existant - instead of the AI finding the best path in a mountainous valley, you have to manually click them through the path. My 'hero' died after the first group of enemies after I earned a squad, then my team was massacared by the next. I'm sure I'm just 'playing it wrong'. I may give this game another chance in the future, but considering I don't play strategies much, I'm more likely to look for a better game in the first place.",
