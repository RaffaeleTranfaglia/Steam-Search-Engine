Great game, cannot recommend it enough, due to its depth, scope, GUI, graphics.  The CTDs mentioned by others can be ameliorated by changing game settings at startup, doing regular saves, getting the latest patch - visit the AGEOD forum for the game, where there are lots of tips on this. It's a resource intensive game, so minimize that where possible, for instance not loading all the map at startup.  The game is absolutely playable - I have many hours with it, before I got it registered on Steam It has a learning curve. I note most of the 'no' recommendations on Steam are from people who have played the game just fractions of an hour, or so. Give the game some time. Do the tutorials.  This is the ultimate Napoleonic era game, and if you'll invest some time in it, you won't regret it.",

Ageods games have more information/tooltips than any historical game I know of. Highly recommended 9/10. Here is some gameplay to give you an idea of what to expect.

When I think I am doing it correct something else moves. I find this to be annoying at best. I do recommend this game. Just some learning curves I suppose in getting used to it. And yes, I have watched some of the videos in how to do some of these things. But still isn't working out the way I like. Well, if things turn around for me. I'll let you all know. Cheers!",
