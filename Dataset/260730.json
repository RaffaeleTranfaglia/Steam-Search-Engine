Great story, good graphics, nice maps and little details which will make you smile. Great game from great era of game makers. And the soundtrack!",

Sure, it has a few bugs and can be a little clunky at times but once you get these things sorted it can be great fun!  Still as good as I remember it, and glad to be able to play this just like old times :)",

Are you into making noise with guns and killing a bunch of enemies at a time? Or you prefer sneaky one by one knife kill? Or maybe you want to poison your enemy, hide and watch as they kill one another? What about big boom with a dynamite? Your choice.   I completed this game at least 5 times already, and yet, every time I enjoy playing it and play each lvl differently, using different players and combinations. You can really finish a map in 10-15 minutes or 1 hr, all depends on your choice and actions. The farther you go into the game, the more fun maps are.   I will never delete this game from my pc. I know that each time, after completing the game, I will return and start all over again. Game control is simple and game price is just silly. You have nothing to lose.",

The environments are well designed, the graphics are beauty, the voice acting is good, the music feels right, the history is nice, the interface is easy to use and the levels have the right amount of challenge to make you explore different ways of playing.  This game has everything it takes to be awesome.  I think it gets a little repetitive, but not to the point of boring.  One of the best strategy games I ever played.  8/10",

I really recommend it, but as the guy says on the top of reviews, if you have Windows 7 or 8, you 'll have problems.  I have windows 7 64bit. It is still playable, but it freezes sometimes,  forcing me to shutdown computer. It is still worth it though.  Trust me, the Desperados 2 is nothing compared to this!",

At the beginning, the game froze every 5 minuts, so I had to kill it and start again. Then, after few levels, the situation was better. Frequency of freezing was lower and lower. Finaly, I was able to play few last levels without any problems.  I tolerated all of those restarting because: - starting this game on curent computers with SSD disk is really fast - you can (and you should) use quick-save all the time - this old good stealth western game is just AWESOME  I enjoyed the game 15 years ago, and I enjoyed it again.",
