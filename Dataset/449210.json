            "review_text": "Verdict Guilty is a korean fighting games that tries to recreate those games from the early 90's where everyone created a FG.  This game has a detective/police setting. There are 8 characters (Including the token women from the 90's) who are divided between the police force and the villians. also there is a final boss  The game recreates well the feeling of those unpolished fighting games from he 90's, it has orthopedic movement and the hitboxes/hitstuns are at times weird, but there are some mechanics that could be interesting for some  - All the characters had a movement that spend bullets. - Characters can only do 1 throw per round, that being said, the throws are special moves: The police characters can handcuff you for 3 seconds, in this state you can't block or do moves but you cant move. The villians set a bomb on your body that will explode after 15 seconds.  I can't see myself playing this that much since it doesn't had online mode, but for $2.24 I think that is an ok game that could get you some laughs while playing on versus. Also even though the artwork isn't my taste at all, I liked the police setting and the use of pixel art that recreates well those games from the 90's (even though not like the masterpieces from SNK or Capcom) ",

            "review_text": "The game itself is beautiful and well done, with some great gameplay. However, this game is a nightmare for non-keyboard players. While it does support X-Input you can't remap the buttons. The controls on my fightstick are by default messed up, making the game difficult to play. Also, the training mode is very misleading, most training modes allow you to practice your moves on a training dummy who's AI by default doesn't move, in most games you can change the AI settings but in this game you just fight the same AI over and over again. Super disappointed.",

If this does good enough who knows maybe we'll get an improved sequel so I do reccomend this if you wanna kill 3 bucks.",

Verdict Guilty is in a way a charming game to me and yet somehow as a massive fighting game enthisuast it does not feel totally aimed at me.  Verdict Guilty is a 2D and apprently Korean fighting game inspired by early versions Street Fighter II. Hmm? Oh sorry I typed that wrong. Verdict Guilty is Street Fighter II. That's it. It is a cute little game and I will recommend it on the basis that it is a very functional fighting game at a price that really does make it a game worth trying.  That is all it is though. It has no lasting value in a competitive setting since its fun but not that kind of fun. Its a charming tribute to Street Fighter II and thats it. Functional and fun for that and nothing more.",
