You think you figured it out until you look closer. It would be great to see something like this turn into a full game one day.",

However, as you push play, rewind, and explore what's going on, you find there is some depth to a story being told. The fun is putting it all together. Like a detective, there is joy in weeding through the distractors and finding out what really went wrong. Great time and would love to do more of this.",

See the story from different points of view as you watch the characters. 6 different stories take place all in this small dinner.

            "review_text": "This was an intense experience. Much better than I expected. It took me a while to figure out that it's not really a game, but 'just' a story where you can mess with time. This did not dissapoint me, because at that point I was already completely caught up in the story.  The graphics are extremely well done, so you do actually feel like you are at some future alien bar. The good graphics and the possibility to rewind and stop time adds some weird element of voyeurism in Quanero. This is what makes the whole thing extremely great. It takes a while to feel comfortable breaking the NPCs 'personal space', listening in on their personal conversations, Look at them when time i frozen, etc.   After you do get comfortable with this, you really start playing around with time, almost abusing this new godlike power.  This concept could be a completely new type of game. There are definitely posibilities here. I can't wait for more of this kind.",

I wish that it was a tad longer, the crime was a little more subtle and required a little more detective work. One thing that is amazing though is the setting menu. Adjusting you quality was easier in this game than any I have played on the vive. ",
