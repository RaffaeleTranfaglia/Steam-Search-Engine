            "review_text": "Please don't be alarmed about the negative reviews. My first impression of the game from just the negative reviews were that this game sucked before even playing it, but a friend talked me into playing it and I got hooked.  I am writing this after 25 hours of playing the game since the launch on Steam so I think I have some right to do this review  tl;dr The game is okay, it's not the best but it is playable without doing any micro transactions or anything.  In this review I'm not quoting any other review people have given just typing the most generic review of which i have seen.  Let's talk about Steam Launch/micro transactions and the bad reviews. I have been looking at pretty much all of the negative reviews and some of them are pretty good and gives fair points. But some of them are just people that had problem with the steam launch or are just Steam Hardcore people.  First day of launch. A lot of people that started to play could not get in because of couldn't load plugins and just gave up right there and wrote a bad review. Not really fair if you ask me, It would be like I would just give up on a game such as Diablo 3 on launch for error 37, that was a REAL problem but that was fixed. And so was this after the first day. When entering battle with a friend the game sometimes would get locked and you couldn't do anything because everything wasn’t loaded properly, to fix you had to restart the game, and when you got back you were still in the combat so you didn't have to restart or give up on your friend, this have been solved from what I have seen. There were some clipping problem but it really wasn’t an issue at all  Micro Transaction in the game pretty okay for the resources that you get, As of yet I haven't payed anything but i have gone through the shop looking at all the different things you can buy. You can get 'SEALS' which is the pay currency from the main quest and different daily quests later in the game so you can still get them through that and if you log in everyday you will also get them from being an active player. If anything you can play this game for free no problem at all it just takes more time to play and some grinding. If you compare it to any else game it's pretty much the same as Hearthstone, Magic the Gathering and league of legends. If you pay things, you will get the easier and faster. But people that don't have the time or money will say immediately 'p2w' when you still can complete the game without paying anything.  The most generic negative review for the game. 'Mobile game inside a web browser with micro transaction p2w' As of yet I haven't payed a dime, cent or Pennie for the game and it have been going pretty good. I haven't had any problem progressing in the game without paying for faster unit or anything, you just need to be patient in the game to get in to it. Just going down a lot of the negative reviews they are MOSTLY people that have played 0.5 or less saying 'p2w wait forever' etc. After 25 hours I am level 13 and got 50 upgraded Sentinels and around 250 archers and 120 battle priests and is still going strong without paying anything, I have been grinding wood but nothing else really and will lose around 1-0 units per fight while farming. It's not hard at all.   Please comment if you want me to add something to the review like about the interface, gameplay etc. This is my first real review that i have written for a game without joking around.",

Its worth to pass a little time with it :D",

It is a combination of MMORPG and RTS, and the combination just blends together to make a GREAT game! This is coming from someone who normally can't stand RTS games in the first place. It is a lot of fun. Don't think twice, just get it.  On another note, yes, there are 'P2W' aspects of it, but you don't need to pay anything to play it, and I certainly haven't. Just take your time and be patient. Besides, I don't understand people that complain about paying for things on a F2P game. Why wouldn't game developers want to make money on what they have made? Wouldn't you? Let's be fair here.",

Have been playing this game for over a year, and would recommend to every Heroes fan.",

Let me hit you with some of the shop items:  Hero Seal packages: 4,00$ to 125,00$+Booster and 'permits' for building, respec or 'retries'  Player Portraits: 2,50$ or 5,00$  Pets: 4,00$ or 8,00$  Basic Resources: 0,50$ to 4,50$  Special Resources: 0,80$ up to 35,00$  Hero equipment  RAFFLE : 0,30$ with a chance to be either rare or epic artifact (blue or purple) of the same level as your hero. +2,00$ to 'refine' said artifacts stats of your choice.  'Attire' aka Skins: 10$ * for each playable character  Showing a video of actual gameplay would be a deathsentence, because it's boring AF.  It takes 30 minutes to build basic troops I suspect that higher tier units take a lot more.  This game is whalebait and if you spend money on this game you are officially a whale and should go extinct.  Have a good day.",

They expect you to be made of money and shovel every dime that you have to win at this. I was hoping for a traditional type Roleplay Game and was slapped with a strategy based thing that wasn't even worthy of the title. The game did NOT let me move my soldiers like I wanted to, and would want to put them in harms way when they did. Which took away from the strategy portion of the game. This is the first time in a LONG time I've been completely and utterly disappointed in a game...  Seriously guys. Unless you value your sanity, DO NOT play this game. Game Devs... Really? You really had to botch up what could have been a wonderful game? I've seen monkeys do better.",

This version is so dissapointing and frustrating. It is more a tablet or smartphone game than a PC game. PC gamers go on their pc's to play a videogame for a couple of hours, but you cant with this silly game. After about 10 minutes you're pretty much done again. Playing the waiting game... You're restricted in so many ways, new troops take hours and hours to regenerate unless you pay them money to hasten it. New resources take ages to regenerate unless you pay them money. More hero slots = more money. Money. Money. Money!   I'd GLADLY pay 10-15 euro for this game if it was without the micro transactions and faster army regenerations etc. The way it is right now though is simply unplayable and certainly not worth spending ANY money on.  None of this is about enjoyment, its pay to win.  I don't understand why this is even on Steam, this is something that you'd expect in the Play Store on your mobile device. Under the free apps section, where it belongs.",
