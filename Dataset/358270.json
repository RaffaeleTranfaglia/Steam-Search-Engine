Brings back memories and the gameplay holds up to this day with precision controls and a proper AI that scales appropriately. It's still just as good as you remember, except for the resolution of course... but that's to be expected.

It is old and looks ugly for todays standards, but it didn't aged that bad. Working perfectly on El Capitan, there is a tuto on the community on how to solve the compability issue.  Too bad MP is not working :/",
