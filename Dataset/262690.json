            "review_text": "Xbox Live Indie Game fans may remember Little Racers STREET from a year or two ago. The popular XBLIG title has now made its way to Steam with a few additions along the way. Little Racers STREET is a top down view arcade style racing game with a single player career mode and online multiplayer for up to twelve players.  The racing action takes place over two ‘cities’ in which the tracks are created by blocking off road junctions to create a route. Think of it like the routes in games such as Need for Speed. This allows around 60 different tracks to race on, double that if you mirror them. The tracks range from short loop style routes to long ‘tour of half the map’ races. The cities are an urban area with scenery such as buildings and train tracks and the second a more open area with mountains and canyons providing the backdrop. To add some variety there are night and dusk lighting as well as rain and snow weather conditions which affect the vehicles handling. The two cities combined with the number of route permutations (around 200) means you won’t get bored of the tracks too soon.  There are 41 vehicles to choose from, split into classes from E, the slowest, to A being the fastest. The classes are decided by four attributes; Power, Turning, Grip and Nitro. These can be upgraded in the garage, and if you upgrade enough you can even have the vehicle go up a class. The range of vehicles is good, from nimble mini’s and cumbersome buses up to super charged beasts, all of which can be painted and decaled. Depending on the type of race, speed is not always the best, as tracks can be very twisty so choosing a vehicle with lower speed and higher grip can make a massive difference.  The career mode starts you with a small amount of money to buy a low class vehicle and get straight into the race. Depending on the race, you can be up against three to eleven other drivers. Credits are earned depending on the outcome and if you find your opponents too easy you can increase the difficulty to earn a larger reward. The AI is very competitive on the harder difficulties and one or two minor mistakes on the track will punish you. As you complete races your leaderboard ranking changes accordingly, it can be a bit of a grind working your way up the leaderboard and vehicle classes, but there is plenty to do.  The multiplayer mode allows you to host, join or search for a race. A number of options are available if you are hosting a game including a choice of public or private games, number of vehicles and the race length. If you wish to, you can host a game and fill it with AI racers and play until some humans join the start of the next race. Surprisingly, you are unable to choose which track or conditions to race on. I haven’t spent any time playing multiplayer against other humans on the PC as the game had not yet been released on Steam, but I spent a lot of hours playing on the XBLIG version and I can assure you it is immense fun.  The career mode will keep you busy for several hours as you progress through the classes. The multiplayer mode is where the lifespan is, get a few friends involved you can easily spend an evening racing against each other and inventing game modes such as ‘cops and robbers’ with differently painted vehicles and decals. If you enjoy racing games and simply want that arcade fun experience then this is a must buy.    Gameplay: 8.5   A lengthy career mode with challenging AI if you increase the difficulty. Vehicle handling is spot on. The multiplayer mode provides many hours of enjoyment.    Graphics: 8.5   Smooth 60FPS graphics which look nice, but often missed as you are tearing around the track.    Sound: 7   A mix of music tracks which sound decent. Sound effects are sparse as expected in a racing game but they do the job.    Final Score: 8.5    Review originally posted on  Gamergeddon  [www.gamergeddon.com] ",

So, with this context is LRS a good game? Yes, it is. Here you can find pretty fun races, with cool cars (they aren't licensed, but you'll recognize them) and reasonable graphics. The achievements are challenging and it'll make you play it for hours and hours.  'But, I'm Windows/Mac user, should I buy it?' Well, you'll have more racing options in these platform, but maybe you enjoy LRS anyway, I just don't know if for LRS' price you can't find a better game. But maybe you should buy LRS in a promotion.",

            "review_text": "At first when I saw this game I was reminded Super Off Road or RC Pro Am (on NES) and was hoping for something similar. I got it, and I got a little more.  Definitely what is shown on the trailer is the basis of what this game is. It's a top down sort of racer with dynamic camera angles that definitely make up the game. The first camera angle reminds me somewhat of Super Off Road,RC Pro Am, or Sim City 3 when you take control of vehicles. Not a bad angle, and a good one for nostalgic feel. However, some problems persist with views as you'll see buildings get in your way. None the less an outline of your car is shown but sometimes it is difficult to see. Which brings me to the next camera angle which is dynamic and shows you more of the track ahead of you. The variety of camera angles adds depth to the game.   One would think of course seeing your player would be of utmost importance. It is but it adds to the game play. The driving itself is relatively simple and reminds me of literally having a toy car between my fingers (which is not a bad thing). For a grown man I like the game for the grown-up feel it gives but I like it at the same time sort of bringing me back in time when games were simpler (such as Pro Am or Off Road). The driving handles great and the ability to see if you beat your best track time is made even easier. Nitro is also a big factor within the game and when to use it. I find even playing at medium difficulty you may come in first a lot, but there will be some races where it will feel sort of inconsistent and you'll find yourself having a hard time catching up to first. Damage is sort of negligible but I'm only on class D and as the cars get faster more damage may occur. Damage of course has to be paid after each race. After completing races there are achievements such as completing every course on a certain racing level. There are credits rewarded in career mode after racing which enables cars to be upgraded or new ones to be bought. There is even a free roam mode to choose from! That's pretty sweet!  The  visuals  are suitable to this game, and maybe in a few places could have been better. I like the fact that toy cars were used. Cars have a custom paint option. It's almost like having my micro machine toy car the color I've always wanted it. It's not need for speed detail but it's enough detail to keep the game cool. The  sounds  are decent, nothing too amazing but nothing short of good. When the guy says final lap or new best time it sort of sounds off. Either than that no complaints.  I like this game and would like to see a DLC or something added. Maybe add weapons in the game and make it like mario kart? Why not a demolition mode? I'd suggest more things but I'm not getting paid here for them. (Cop chases anyone)?   This is a good game... I like this game so obviously it will get a good rating. I bought it on sale and if it suits you I'd recommend buying it. Sucks that it isn't local co-op but I can see why (would be hard seeing each car). Food for thought though! There is a bit of a grind with career mode when it comes to getting new cars but the races are short and enjoyable enough that you won't notice, until you start getting to later classes where prices are high. The bonus of it is that some races have a pretty big pay-out. If you don't care for some achievement or potential card opportunity then just keep on going to the horse races. Could have been easily an 8 if more game modes were added.   RATING : 7.1/10.        Gameplay   B+     Story / Campaign   C+     Visuals / User Interface   B-     Sounds / Music   C+     Replay-ability   C+     Overall    B-     Also the multiplayer seems to be somewhat alive at certain times. Either than that it can be pretty quiet. Buy a four pack?",

            "review_text": "Probably one of my favourite racing titles for PC. It's like if Death Rally had a cool cousin that wasn't into weapons and violence.  You can quickly jump into a quick race if you are not into grinding your way into earning money for your career cars or jump into career mode and buy lots of cars, paint them up, fine tune them and race on select tracks. The game looks visually pretty too and I'd very much recommend a Xbox 360 controller to play but it isn't required. The thumping electro music is pretty darn awesome too to race with!  Only downside is that I couldn't find any Multiplayer action going on but the single-player is just as fine with difficulties from Easiest up to Unfair.",

There are some rudimentary customization such as vinyl patterns, different paint colors (primary and secondary), and quite a few models of vehicles to pick from. Try not to damage your car as damages needs to be repaired, but you probably won't go broke, but you won't advance much either.

            "review_text": "Definitely deserves three out of five stars. Before I go on to give my constructive criticism, to anyone who reads this. I highly recommend buying this game. Definitely worth the 6.99!  Only three problems. One is probably related to the fact that i'm playing on a Mac and personally, i've never had good gaming experiences on a Mac. Anyway, i've encoutered a 'Critical Error' screen twice now while playing the game. First time it wiped my data. As annoying as that was, it leads to my second criticism. The game progresses way to quick. Giving next class cars for every 20 top three places, or every race finished. That reward should be more like 50 first place wins. I'm not entirely sure, but i've only had the game for four hours and i'm already to class C cars. My second criticism is this one SUV that first appears in class D. I forget it's name, but it terribly needs to be nerfed. I looked at it's stats and it triumphs grip by doubling the average D class car's. But no matter, it suffers power. Yet oddly enough my D class vehicle with 45 power points, and C class with 75 still get's completely destroyed by this SUV. If this SUV ever starts in the front row, I have to quit and start a new race because all it takes it two laps for it to not only clear visual distance, but also mini map distance. Also, may I suggest a few things. I think it would be nice if you could read not only your own, but ever other car's complete race elapse time on the leadboard after. Also, the cars should probably keep going after you finished, instead of haulting where they are. I just thought that would be a nice idea, personally i've had a lot of photo finish's and I thought it would be cool to see the split time. One last suggestion, I bet you get this a lot, but there needs to be more variety of cars.",

All of this this translates into a game that is fun and satisfying to play, and one where if you lose, it is, for the most part, your fault.  Oh, and the comment above about competitors being prettier is not really a backhanded way of slamming LRS for being ugly, because it's not. In fact, it's even got a little 'art style'-thing going. Even setting that aside, it's looks are functional, and add to the feeling of racing toy cars which is sort of what the whole genre is all about, rather than being a driving simulation.",

On top of that, I love racing games and arcade style racing games are my favorite of those.  This isn't the best one ever made, but it ticks enough boxes that I'll recommend it.  The Good:  Races only take a couple of minutes, but are longer at the higher levels. There must be hundreds of different levels, all similar, but with very different routes, which makes for a lot of replayability.  This game, unlike many of these top down racers, actually has multiple camera options, one of which is a behind the car 3rd person view which makes the game much more intense. I play this angle most of all, as it is quite like the normal view in many traditional racing games.  The game is extremely fast paced at the higher levels and quite difficult. You will need lightning fast reflexes to make it through the 90 degree turns that come one after another after another after another in some instances.  The Bad:  The controls are very twitchy and not exactly smooth. You turn in slight increments, which is strange considering this game seems to have a full 3d physics engine behind it. I don't know if this is because I'm playing with a controller or not, but I doubt it.  There is very little artistic variety. There is very little variety, frankly, of any kind, except for with the route of the tracks and the visual style of the cars. This is a game of repition on a theme and gameplay that you had better enjoy to want to play very much of.",
