            "review_text": "Still not complete the whole game yet but I can say it is a fair good hidden-object game.  So far I do not see lots of hidden objects to be found. The hint option is very useful if you get stuck.  The puzzles can be challanging for sometimes but you can skip those if the timebar reaches to the end.  The story is quite good as a murder incident. The cutscene and voice acting are so far so good.  Got it free but I think it is still worthy under a discount.",

            "review_text": "Another decent hidden object game, but as with many in the genre it has its problems, which while not game breaking annoyed me more than normal, but overall it had an interesting enough storyline and the gameplay was fairly decent, so still a fairly decent game overall, especially for the fairly neglible price (especially when on sale).  The story has you as Quincy MD crossed with MacGyver trapped at a hotel during a storm where you almost died getting to your rich new patient. People start dropping like flies around you and you have to investigate and try to stop the killer before he runs out of victims. The plot is a bit of a mixed bag, a lot of it is shown in news clippings and details of the history of the hotel and all the people being killed who all seem linked back to an arson a couple of decades previously, so you have to race to uncover the identity of the killer. At one point there is the hint it might be an interesting denouement in the nature of identity/memento or some other psychological thriller, but in the end it feels more like a daytime soap plot (except for the body count).  Still that part is okay enough to provide the background for the gameplay, so that breaks down into the hidden object scenes which are of the construct an item style of HOG, which is where you go all MacGyver and construct all sorts of items from things found in one place, so at one point you collect a safecracking kit (and then proceed to use the screwdriver to take the entire safe door off ignoring the rest of the kit you painstakingly searched for), some sort of miniflamethrower, a hot air balloon (because you didn't want to just lift/push the basket off the item you needed).  While very inventive it all feels pretty bizarre (more so that normal for the genre even, which is pretty bad by and large). The imminent peril of people dying of snakebite, or being strapped into a chair at the mercy of the killer, and then you go around repairing a globe, or a piano, most often just to get common household tools - that you generally discard after one use so there can be another convoluted puzzle to get yet another screwdriver or whatever later in the story. You rarely get any explicit story hints of why you should be interacting with these objects, just they are the only things on the map which can be interacted with left, so that must be where the latest essential tool can be found.  Anyway that gripe aside the scenes play fairly well and feel somewhat naturalistic, the puzzles also tend to be unexplained - I guess the hotel owner likes messing with his employees and forcing them to play puzzles to open doors and otherwise do their job. No wonder all the staff seem to have disappeared before the story starts. The puzzles themselves are mostly fairly easy, with a reasonable variety, but the controls are frequently wonky and things don't always move how you want them to - this even forced me to skip one puzzle as I couldn't move the piece far enough right to finish it. There were a couple I found more difficult but I think it is more down to me being bad at those types of puzzle (the 4 shape overlapping rotating puzzle right at the end being the main one). Of course with no achievements you can actually use the skip/hint buttons if you really get stuck without it forcing you to replay it later to get the last couple of achievements (and forcing you to find a way to do those puzzles or consult a walkthrough anyway).  Overall it is a recommendation, especially given the price, but don't expect too much, it has a lot of flaws to go with the good points. Also I laughed out loud (literally) immediately after freeing the Senator from the chair - I don't think this is the intended reaction...anyone else do the same?",
