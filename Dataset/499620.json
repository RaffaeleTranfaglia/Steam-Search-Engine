Only observation (and the others that tried it said the same thing) when your up high and it just keeps spinning it made everyone dizzy. Tone that portion down a little and its perfect.   Other then that, game is just to fun! You feel the gravity and everything! So much fun! Best ride game in VR that I have exp so far. Highly recomend if your surfing for a 'ride' game download 'booster'",

I originally purchased from the website and months later saw it on steam and sent the devs a email and they were nice enough to send a steam key. Cant say enough good things about it and cant wait for the updates and maps.",
