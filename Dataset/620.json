            "review_text": "Portal was sort of a little experiment of a huge company. That’s why success of the first part of the Portal was a surprise even for the VALVe. Therefore seriously question arose about the Portal 2. And what we got? Let's see.  　STILL ALIVE?  　　The game begins with the fact that Chell along with her new partner, personality module Wheatley, is trying to escape from an abandoned Aperture Science laboratory. Throughout the game, the plot makes a interesting twists. Individual deserves compliments perfect finale, after which there remain only a warm feeling. In Portal 2 no epic stories, huge explosions, incredible action, or the salvation of humanity. Instead, there is a charismatic characters, intelligent humor and interesting puzzles.  　ONE IS GOOD, BUT TWO IS BETTER  　　One of the achievements of the new Portal has been the emergence of the cooperative. Co-op story is a continuation of the plot of the single player. At first I thought that the only difference of the cooperative is the presence of two players with portal-guns, instead of one. In fact, the cooperative has unique ideas. Many puzzles solving quite differently. I advise you not to play cooperative with a random person (there is that possibility), and play it with a good friend.  　ENDLESS TESTS  　　In game was added a level editor, so anyone can create their own test chambers or try to play the levels of other players. To be honest, most of the player-created levels are too simple or ridiculous. But there is sufficient interesting maps (and some of them really hard). In no case do not miss the community maps.  　Multiplayer: 　　Online: Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ  　　Co-op: ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺O 　Storyline: ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺O 　Graphics: ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺O 　Gameplay: ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺  　  　Complexity of the achievements: All achievements can be easily earned (if you have good friend for the co-op) in the one-two walkthrough.  　　　　 VALVe made another good 　　game. With good intelligent humor, 　　charismatic characters and unusual 　　interesting gameplay.  　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　As expected, nine out of ten [9/10]. ",

            "review_text": "Very Impressive. Because this message is pre-recorded, any comments we may make about your success are speculation on our part. Please disregard any undeserved compliments. – GLaDOS  There is so much to be impressed about in Portal 2. From the amazingly developed and memorable characters to the brilliantly balanced puzzles, Portal 2 may well be the best puzzle game ever created.  I purchased Portal 2 about 11 months after it was released. I didn’t even know who Valve was back then, I didn’t know what Source was and I didn’t have a clue about anything to do with the Portal story, but after playing it, Valve quickly became my favourite game developers. Back then, I was only interested in 2 things. Gameplay, and graphics. We had only recently upgraded to an Xbox 360 from a very old, original PlayStation, so the games I’d bought for the Xbox were, as you can imagine, amazing, but Portal 2 had better graphics than any other game I’d been playing. I was also interested in the gameplay, and Portal 2 nailed it with its hilarious characters and difficult puzzles. As I grew up and played the game over and over again, I noticed things I hadn’t noticed before, like secret rooms and signs on the walls, which got me into researching the story. Trust me, the story is deep… but, this review is spoiler free, so I’d encourage you to do it yourself!  Portal 2 is a brilliant combination of puzzles, well developed characters, and an RPG element, which makes the game amazing, and better than any other puzzle game I’ve played before. To start off with, you wake up in a strange room, and you meet a funny little “ball” robot named Wheatly. He guides you over to the old testing tracks, but on your way to escape the facility, he accidently turns on the main core robot, who controls everything, GLaDOS! She “forgives” you (play the oringinal portal) and instead of killing you, she spares your life and instead makes you test, as she indicates “for the rest of your life”. I’m not going to say any more, because it would be a shame to spoil it for anyone, but I highly recommend you play this game. This is one of the few games I would say to buy at full price if you have enough, because it’s totally worth it. There is also a co-op campaign that has a completely different story, it's great to play with a friend. Thanks for reading!",

            "review_text": "The original Portal was a success I don't think anyone anticipated. Arguably the best part of The Orange Box, it was a remarkably clever and original puzzle game, with an absurd amount of character. But to everyone's disappointment, it was all over too soon. But we were not forsaken; quite the contrary. With Portal 2, a direct sequel (by which I mean to say you should play the original first, as well as before reading this review which will inevitably spoil it), Valve has not only given us a bigger and better game, but one of the greatest pieces of interactive entertainment ever. I mean no hyperbole when I say Portal 2 is an absolute masterpiece on a grand scale, and a game absolutely everyone should get the chance to play!  Fair warning, there is no way to talk about Portal 2 without spoiling everything that occurs in the first game, so keep that in mind if you have yet to play it (by which I have to ask, why the heck not?). Disclaimers out of the way, Portal 2 once again places you inside Aperture Science, an expansive underground scientific research and testing facility with fewer ethics than living test subjects. Which is to say just you, Chell, reimprisoned and put to sleep for who knows how long, only awakened when the entire facility is on the verge absolute destruction. Unlike before however you aren't alone, now joined by a naive little robot named Wheatly. With GLaDOS in pieces, escape seems like a simple objective. That is until someone flips a switch to turn her back on...  The original Portal is still one of the best written, and most hilarious games I've played, and yet its sequel is miles ahead of it in every possible way. With only a handful of characters, it's amazing how charming and witty every line is. Hilarious, clever, and maybe even a little touching, I can't think of a game that even comes close to matching how perfectly timed and expertly written every moment of Portal 2 is. It's minimal cast does an amazing job of breathing life into the decrepit facility, and makes the simple aspect of walking from one door to the next and immensely enjoyable activity.   And it isn't just the writing that deserves remark, but how Valve has implemented it to seamlessly interact with your actions. Characters respond to what you're doing in such a realistic manner that it's hard to believe they are simply programs setup to do so. With so many games relying on traditional, uninteresting storytelling mechanics, Portal 2 moves the medium forward in ways developers need to take note of.  However smartly written the dialog may be, it's in the portal puzzles themselves that Valve's intelligence really shines. Not content to simply reiterate the same mechanic we saw in the first game, new elements such as propulsion gel and laser maneuvering cubes are added regularly and consistently expand on the basic portal mechanic in unexpected and interesting ways. Every time I thought I'd seen all the ways a mechanic could be used, Valve expanded the spectrum and again astounded my expectations with the outwardly simple variances in usage that never would have occurred to me. Even on my second playthrough the puzzles never stopped being incredibly rewarding to solve, and giving me just enough of a challenge to consistently test my intellect in a wholly unique fashion.  For how old the Source engine is at this point, you'd never know Portal 2 was built on it based on how it looks. To this day I am utterly astonished at what Valve manages to pull off with the engine, and this is easily its most impressive usage to date. The once sterile Aperture Science is now presented in a gorgeous display of disrepair. Walls crumbly around you, lights flicker and cast dazzlingly shadows, plants grow through into the facility, and it all looks absolutely amazing! Even with it's makeover, Aperture is still an eminently memorable and distinct place to inhabit, and the increased variety in locations does an impressive job of realizing the sheer size of the facility which we've only scratch the surface of.  I always forget to mention the soundtrack, not because it isn't a fantastic accompaniment to your journey through Aperture, but because it blends so well with the rest of the game that I almost forget it's there. That's not a slight against it however, it's a complement to how suited it is for the game that I can't separate one from another. It's a brilliant score with so many layers I couldn't begin to pick it apart to describe it to you (but thankfully I don't need to, as even if for some reason you don't play the game the soundtrack is freely downloadable). As for the ending, well let's just say Jonathan Coulton is a genius and leave it at that.  And then there is the coop mode; yet another brilliant way Valve has surprised me, turning the solitary campaign into a multiplayer experience that demands cooperation. This is what impresses me the most about the mode; it isn't just two players going through a game designed for one, but an entirely new set of levels purposely designed to force you to work with your partner to complete them. It's amazing what can be accomplished with two sets of portals, and this is fully taken advantage of in what are perhaps the best designed puzzles in the entire game. If you don't have a friend to play with, go make one for this game. It's something you shouldn't miss out on.  I can't get over it. I've been impressed by Valve numerous times in the past, love Portal to death, and thought I knew what I was getting with it's successor. But Portal 2 is so much more than that. It's an incredible achievement in everything it attempts, from it's outstanding script to the bewildering puzzles and spectacular presentation. It's the best game Valve has ever made, one of my all time favorites, and without a doubt one of the medium's greatest accomplishments!  Now if you'll excuse me, there's testing to do.

            "review_text": "Portal 2 is the amazingly imersive and fun sequel to the amazingly imersive and fun videogame known as portal. It isn't however one of those sequels where they give you the same product with prettier graphics and do nothing to improve on it; the game contains many great new innovations. At its core, portal is a puzzle platformer game, and this aspect is combined with the story in a way that forces you to think of outside-the-box solutions. The characters are all compelling; even the silent protagonist gets some characterization during the game. She's smart, good at jumping, and is able to jump over both emotional and physical obstacles with ease. When things get tough, and she has a murderous AI tryng to kill her at every turn, she just keeps testing. The game has essentially three modes. There's the story, co-op, and community made maps. The community for this game is amazing. They take all the resources Valve has lent them, and they make games barely recognizable as part of portal. It could also go in the opposite direction, and you get a game that feels like it should be a part of the main story. One major downside is that you cann't play co-op, or in community maps, if you lack an internet connection. There are many great maps that make you think and analyze the tools you're given in different ways; It's a shame that you can't just download and play one of them while on the go.  If you're not into puzzle platforming, in-depth and imersive storytelling doesn't impress you, and you don't like any of your friends enough to play this with them without committing murder, this isn't the game for you. 10/10",

The voice acting and dialogue in this game is amazingly entertaining and funny, I found myself chuckling multiple time during the game due to the character dialogues! The level design in this game is also great as there were some levels which left me stumped for quite awhile and it took me quite alot of brain power to solve them and that gave me a great feeling after doing so!  This game features a co-operative mode which allows players to play with people in your friend list or complete strangers through match-making. There are some form of customization options such as hats in the co-operative mode that can be unlocked through completing the game. There was supposed to be more customization options available in a shop but it has since been discontinued. Trading is also unavailable which is pretty unfortunate as it would be great for players to exchange or sell cosmetics.  There is also a level creation tool in this game which allow players to create their own Portal 2 levels and share it online with others by uploading it to the workshop! Several interesting extra content includes a portal 2 comic which serves as a prequel to the game and a super 8 (a pretty old movie by now) interactive game demo.

I cannot say its the best game I have played but it is most certainly one of the most memorable games I've played. So far, the best story I have seen in a game as well.

Portal pretty much changed my outlook on that. I'd known about the Portal games for quite a long time before actually playing them. The first game was a great start, but I did wish there could have been more substance.  Portal 2 is the embodiment of the perfect sequel. The gameplay improves greatly from the first; the chambers feature more factors, like the gels, hard light bridges, etc., and feel much more challenging. And, if you somehow get bored of the main Portal 2 campaign, there's also co-op!  Storyline-wise, it exceeded my already high expectations. The dialogue was usually witty (GLaDOS), hilarious (Wheatley), or both. While there were very few characters in this game, it did a good job of making them complex and interesting. Of course, there are still some loose ends in the plot that were purposely left out, but I feel like it was better off being vague.  Portal 2 definitely lives up to its reputation. After all, it takes a lot to be featured in hundreds of easter eggs across the video gaming universe.",

Some areas were a bit harder to solve (probably because my brain can't function well at 4am), so I just went to bed, and the next day I'd try again, and beat it. The game's puzzles are perfectly balanced in difficulty, and the story itself is a big reason to play this game.  Trust me, the ending is well worth it. REALLY...really...worth it. And please, for your sake, do NOT look up walkthroughs. It will completely ruin your gaming experience.  P.S.: Take off a few hours, and that's how long it took me to beat story mode.

This game was greatly anticipated when it was announced and we all waited in anticipation for the release. The game was not a disappointment, the developers brought us back to Aperture Laboratories and put us to work on new and innovative puzzles, Portal1 and 2 will always be one of my most favorite puzzle games, period.     -Detailed breakdown review-    Story:    You wake up in a strange hotel-looking room, after awakening you discover you're actually still inside Aperture Laboratories and the whole place is falling apart! You need to find a way out and escape before the whole lab falls down around your ears!     Gameplay:  The whole game is based on the core concepts of two portals  (an Orange/red and Blue Portal) , be it moving objects through these portals, moving yourself between these portals, or jumping off high objects to reach hard to reach places, the game is a brainteaser in such a wonderful way. As the catchphrase goes “prepare to think with portals”. There are a number of features in Portal2, there are Single player, Co-op, Community Test Chambers/Workshop, Steam Achievements, and challenge modes where you can compete against your friends for fastest times, least portals used, steps, and more.    Achievements:  There are 51 Achievements for Portal2, Most of the single player achievements are straightforward fun and challenging to get... There are also Co-op achievements, so it would be best to make or get a friend to help you out.   Price:  Portal2 is priced at $19.99 that will be the best 20 dollars you spend. But if you're on a tight budget like me you might want to wait for a 75% off sale, since the game was released in 2011 there's a very good chance that there will be sale for it.   Conclusion:  I really can't sum up how great Portal2 is without saying “look, if you're even remotely interested in trying it out, you don't grasp just what an outstanding puzzle game it is. I highly recommend Portal2 to everyone and anyone.  ------Edits and updates------ Edit/Update September 13, 2015: Here's the URL to see my review for   Portal ",

However, I didn't enjoy the co-op mode quite as much as the singleplayer. Overall, I think this game is the best game of all time.  Pros -Excellent story &amp; puzzle mechanics -Great atmosphere -Easy to run (I can run it on my $100 Dell laptop) -Best sequel -Great level editor -PS3 integration (No longer available) -Great price Cons -Multiplayer could have been improved -Visuals can be better (can be seen as a pro and a con)",

Seriously, almost everyone who says this has not played the whole game. And for the few who did, you clearly did not watch your surroundings enough. The point of the story was to make you want to play more, and it certainly did well on that note. 2: Not very hard. Again, play the whole game first. True, the game was not THAT hard, but I cannot think of a puzzle game that executes the gameplay as well as portal does. While the game itself was not terribly hard, the community has certainly made some head scratching test chambers that will make you want to eat your own words. 3: Crashes. The game does not crash anymore (except on windows 8 so far) so ignore those reviewers who say that because their review is now irrelevent.  Final score 9/10",

I was at a school center, and I saw the place had a COMPUTER LAB, that also had PS3's and 360's. I was pretty happy. At the time, all I played was Minecraft. I used to play my Nintendo DS and DSi and my Gameboy, but I grew out of them. Usually the computers were taken by people playing Minecraft, so I sat myself down at a 360, and I checked under the counter for games. There it was. Portal 2. I played that game so much. Need for Speed: Most Wanted reeled me in to deciding that I wanted a PS3. I got a PS3 with Most Wanted and Portal 2 and other games. I was so happy. One day, I checked the inside and saw there was a code for a free copy on Steam. I remembered that I made a Steam a year ago because my friend told me to, but I never used it! I was happy because you needed a retail or Steam purchase to unlock all Steam features. I started to build my Steam collection from there, and I started an obsession over ALL Valve games, especially Counter Strike and Half Life. Portal 2 is sincerely my favorite game ever.",

This time we get to finally know a lot more about Aperture Laboratories and its dark side. Like in the original game there are 2 people back, Chell (Hero) and GlaDoS (anti-villan). This game brings up right where Portal ended well kinda as you are in a dorm room? You eventually meet someone named Wheatley who tells you that youve been sleeping for 100 years (clear white lie) and that the entire Laboratory is destroyed because of you (so true). The puzzles in each room increase and so does the story. The Co-op is strongly recommended cause many people do not co-operate with you since every puzzle is literally meant for 2 people. Than comes the beloved Steam Workshop making our lives 200% harder. Since you can make your own level, 99% people will rage quit im not lying its not only true but funny. I give this game 9/10 because the co-op mode doesnt have enough features and in my opinion they should add a little more levels in both single and co-op modes. Now go shoot portals in the wrong place and get yelled at by GlaDoS",

The game is about your character (Chell) being stuck in the Aperture Science Laboratories, you must find the famous gun named the Portal Gun. This isnt any old gun, this gun fires out orange and blue potarls these Portals transfer you to different places for example: if you fire a blue portal and fire a orange portal and walk through the blue portal, you will transport to the location of the orange portal. However, this game s not just about having fun with portals, Oh no, theres alot more to do. Your character has to do tests using the portal gun. These tests can be puzzling, but you will have to get through them! There is also a multiplayer option to this game, you and your friend can solve puzzles together, these puzzles can only be completed with your friend so you'll have to figure out what you have to do, and what your friend has to do. Depending on who is player 1 or 2 your characters are 2 different robots. Player 1 is the small robot named Atlas, and Player 2 is the tall robot named P-Body. Atlas has 2 differents shades of blue with his portal gun and P-Body has 2 different shades of orange with his portal gun. The singleplayer campaign is very fun (except for the puzzles that I mentioned earlier they can be frustrating but they can be fun also) the funniest part of the campaign is the voice actor for a small robot named Wheatly he has a really funny voice and says lots of funny things he is voice by Stephen Merchant. Anyway this game is very fun and exciting I would definately recommend it to all my friends and anyone else. 10/10 Because of... well baisically what I just said. This is a must buy!

Before you buy this game, you should buy the first one-the story goes on.  My opinion: This is the BEST game of the world. You can have endless fun (with or without your friends) ,because there are millions of maps, which are created by other people. The first part was also good, but it´s short. The second part is perfect: A long story, you can create your own maps and play the maps from your friends. This game is so cool, I would buy it again if I had to.

Sadly, if you don't have any friends, you won't be able to play the co-op, but in my opinion, the singleplayer alone would be worth your money.  Your problem solving skills will come to a test while playing this, but the story alone in this game is something to love; Portal 2 is a perfect example of great narration and character interaction with the player. The characters are enjoyable and the gameplay is easy enough to master. You can explore and find easter eggs that tell you more about the plot and the world you're in.  The co-op is also entertaining. Puzzles that you have to solve with a friend? Nothing could be more fun! The commands help communication alot - you can watch your friend in a small window to see what he sees, and with the easy commands you can tell your friend what to do. You practically don't need voice chat at all, but it does help alot! The puzzles in the game are fun as well, as the small storyline that goes along with the co-op - nothing major, but still enjoyable. And the community maps are endless - you can always get more community made maps, that can be wonderful to play through!  TL;DR: 10/10, would play again. Must buy game if on sale in Steam!  You can also have a drinking game with a friend, if one of you fails, take a shot. You'll get hammered in no time, because mistakes are bound to happen.",

Aperture Laboratories tests humans capability to endure physical puzzles while using a portal gun that will allow you to create portals, 2 portals to be accurate. When you are far into the game you are being supervised by GLaDOS who is a incredible piece of artifical intelligance, GLaDOS is not very friendly too you because you killed her in Portal 1, not to worry though because you have a little robotic friend named Wheatly to help you along the way.

            "review_text": "What can I say that probably hasn't been said a hundred times already about this game.   The game play is unique and interesting, making you think outside the box at times and depending on your skill level with puzzle based games, possibly hit your head against that box a few times (but you know, in a good way). The writing is some of the most insulting dialog I've ever had the joy to sit through, laughing the whole way through. The detail and Easter eggs, which assist in telling you the story are scattered about, and add a fun exploration element that would have been completely non existent otherwise. The voice acting is perfect, the timing, the somewhat computeriness (it's a word now, deal with it), but still with so much emotional quality, admittedly mostly on the sarcastic variety, add to the interesting character far beyond the script alone. And finally the music, such an unusual mix, and songs that have become instant classics to which almost every gamer can now sing along to. All around everything I look for in an enjoyable, immersive, and captivating game play experience.  I have played both portal 1 and 2, and if I have any complaints at all about 2, and it's a small one, it's that I miss having more choices on where to place portals like you had in 1. I mean, I understand the reasoning behind it, give a person too many portable surfaces and you open up the puzzle to the point that it may become quite easy to skip the intended path, losing part of the challenge of the game. Still, this is the one thing that at times makes it hard for me to rate this game as better then the first, only because that element was something I found added to the fun of Portal in the first place. Being able to at times feel as though I had found my own solution to a puzzle, even if it was not how it was meant to be done. Also the simplicity of the first game added to the over all feel of a cold, sterile environment that really let the dialog and game mechanics take center stage.   That said, I found Portal 2 to be an excellent squeal that took a game that started an add in extra, like a prize in a box of cereal, and developed it into it's on beautiful work of art. I find myself replaying it, not to see if I can beat it faster, or get all the achievements (but huh, there's a thought), but more to smile again and enjoy the witty banter and get that warm fuzzy feeling of nostalgia from it all over again.  I haven't even tapped into the co op. To have such an awesome game as a single player probably would have in and of itself made portal 2 a successful sequel, but to add a completely separate, but included co op experience with all new levels, into the mix was more then I could have asked for. It allowed me to bring my dad into the game, which the single player had not managed on its own, and gave the community as a whole a canvas on which to build and share their own puzzles, thus allowing the fun to continue long after the end credits have rolled.   So what can I say about this game, quite a lot really, but seeing as how this is a review to presumably help that one person out there that hasn't quite decided if they should buy this game yet out, I'll simply say this. Buy it, you won't be sorry. It goes on sale enough these days that it's well worth the small amount you'd be spending to get such a full experience and fun story.",

From the gorgeous foliage-draped testing chambers of the Modern Aperature Laboratories to the goo-covered classic Aperature Science Innovators of the 1950s, there is always something amazing and new to look at.   And the puzzles... where do I begin? Portal 2 has all of the fun puzzles that you loved from the prequel, plus puzzles that include a myriad of new features that make you feel clever and stupid at the same time.  Portal 2 also introduces Wheatley, your rescuer from Aperature Labs and loyal companion (  sorry Companion Cube  ), and Cave Johnson, the founder of Aperature Science who you 'meet' through prerecorded messages that play throughout the levels. Both characters turn out to be deep,  smart , and hilarious. And, of course, there's GLaDOS, who never fails to disappoint with her compliments and motivational speeches.  In short, this game had me laughing and pulling my hair out at the same time, and I've never enjoyed myself more. The story itself was full of interesting twists and turns; I really never knew what was going to happen next. I mean, the ending made me sit with my jaw hanging open for what felt like 10 minutes. It alone was a cinematic masterpiece.  If you havent already picked up a copy of this game, I strongly urge you to. It is well worth the $20; you won't regret it.     14/10 would wait five more years for the next Portal again   ",

            "review_text": "Portal 2 is a game that combines a deviously planned and dark plot with great puzzles in the single player. It also has a great co-op option that has an entirely different and equally enticing campaign. I'll start with the single player.  ***NO SPOILERS FOLLOW***  Single Player:  In Portal 2s single player branch, the focus is mostly on the mysterious history of Aperture Science. Originally founded as a world reknown shower curtain company in the mid 1930's. When the 1940's came, they branched off to what they would continue to be, a company that broadened it's products to not just shower curtains, but all things science-related. They made the ground breaking development of the portal gun, or quantam tunneling device, which led them to begin mass-testing in which they created test chambers an used ens of thousands of 'privately kept' test subjects. Over the years though,they began to decay. All of this and so many more shady details are uncovereed in the single player.  Co-op/Multiplayer:  The multiplayer stars the two blue and orange robots you keep seeing in the trailers. One is you, one is your partner, and I would only play multiplayer with a close friend who you communicate well with, otherwise the tests may pose a frustrating ordeal. The great thing about this co-op though, is that it has its own story, and countless levels.  New Mechanics:  The main new mechanic is gels, which change a surface's properties, such as increasing speed while running on them or making them portalable. These are introduced midway through the campaign and are used from then on frequently.  Other:  EASTER EGGS. There are so many, and each adds to the mystery of an already unfathomably awesome campaign. If you finish everything else, these should give you another good few hours of gameplay.  Summary:  It's almost like reading a great novel, except you are the main character.  10/10  IF YOU DON'T BUY IT AND LOVE IT YOUR TOTALLY PSYCHOTIC.  I'm ready for a Portal 3!",

Co-op is the best co-op I've played, genuinely collaborative, requiring synced actions at its hardest. Several new science tools to play around with, like light bridges, air funnels and gels(speed, jump and one for making surfaces portal-friendly). Co-op and SP have their own storyline and characters; they relate to one another, but without either spoiling the other. Level editor with leaderboards. Hilarious comedy, without losing drama and threat.  Cons: More characters and dialog mean less isolation and loneliness, which were part of the appeal of the first(all alone, with a psychotic AI, in a deadly facility).  My recommendation: Even if you don't think you're that good at puzzle games(I'm not), play this. The only people who shouldn't are those who don't like the dark comedy - watch a trailer to see if that aspect appeals to you or not.",

You are put into a deep sleep, and like, three years later or something like that, you wake up in a dark dusty, dirty room, not like the one you went to sleep in. Then another character comes into the story. A core named Wheatley comes knocking on your door. You want to know who it is, so obviously, you open it. He comes in, talks for a bit, and then the room starts moving, smashing into walls, until you jump out. Then you are put into a whole lot of test chambers. I could beat most of them, some of them it took me a bit to figure them out. What I really didn't like was how Wheatley, my favorite character, turns into the bad guy. I've beaten the game, and my favorite chapter is 'The Part Where He Kills You', so sometimes, if I don't want to play from the beginning, I will play that chapter. So, my favorite part of that chapter is when I'm in his lair. I know what to do, how to do it, but I think it's cool when I shoot a portal to the moon, and everything gets sucked in. It really stands out to me when GLaDOS deletes Caroline, and her voice changes, I don't like how she gets rid of me. I like the ride up, the singing turrets and all that, I don't like how I'm in a feild with no city around me, or no building around me. If she was going to get rid of me, why not leave me close to a city? I really think they should make a free Portal three game of me getting back into the building, hanging out with GLados, Wheatley coming back and apologizing and bemcoming friends with us again, and let me be able to go out to the city, live in a house, and be able to visit GLaDOS and Wheatley. I really want to see what happens after that. I don't like how GLaDOS got rid of me, and how there's no city near me, and how I don't know what happens after that. I really want Valve to make another Portal.  What do you think?",

            "review_text": "Definitely a must buy. Portal 2 is a wonderful puzzle game with a funny and heartwarming story. In Portal 2 you learn more about Aperture Science in the past. And it's not like those mostly dull CW TV shows where you learn more about superheroes when they started. It is actually interesting because you learn more about GlaDOS herself (who she is and why she is insane). It is impossible to play this game without smiling from laughter as GlaDOS and the hilariously stupid Wheatley attempt to kill you. You will want to stop progressing through the game just to hear Wheatley try to 'hack' a machine. Most of the time if you wait enough Wheatley will continue attempting to figure out how to get out of a certain situation. For example you will hear his hacking techniques where he makes a list of the objects in a locked room including a computer, the floor, and objects not in the room like pens.  Portal 2 has levels but there are parts of the game where you get out of the test room number i formula and explore the back of the facility in search of a way out. The test rooms themselves are very accessible. To test a hypothesis you don't have to do alot of work, where in other FPSes with puzzle elements you would have to backtrack the whole level to find one stupid cracked wall that looks different from other ones that you have to shoot. They also give you alot of hints in the design of the level. It's kind of hard to describe but the design of the levels (like railings on certain platforms or black spaces on certain places) scratches off some theories with wrong answers on how to solve some of the puzzles.  There is also coop but I have not played it yet. I have looked at the level editor and the great thing about it is that you cannot submit a level unless there is a solution. That definitely means that all the levels in the workshop are genuine.  This is a game that everyone can play and would want to play to the end. I wish Valve would make single player games again. Definitely get it and play it!",

The storyline is fantastic (I’m not gunna spoil it!) and all of the puzzles are challenging and fun! The mental satisfaction of solving one of the puzzles is great! You feel so dumb up to the point you figure out the puzzle chamber and it’s like a spark of satisfaction that feels good up to the point you walk into the next chamber and have ABSOLUTLY no idea how to solve it. The voice acting is fantastic as well, every character sounds EXSACTLY how you would expect and it really makes this game worth the money. One thing i did not expect when this game came out was the multi-player. Having an extra mind in the game with you solving puzzles that are impossible to complete alone is more fun than i have ever had in any multi-player game ever. There is no more I need to say about this game, it’s just a great buy! If you have a couple dollars rolling around then give this game a shot! I promise you won’t regret it!",

That and taking me 3.7 hours to finish single player on my first run-through (granted, I've played the first game so many times, I really never got stuck on a puzzle).  Looking past those few issues, the single player story: incredible. Most games you have maybe a 10-20 hour storyline, but only about 20-30% is pure fun. In Portal 2, the entire playtime is fun. Taking a look at Co-op play, it is flawlessly executed, and while none of the puzzles were overly challenging, they definitely were not easy. They were balanced basically perfectly for new players and old players alike.",

Both games were amazing, the characters terrificly crafted, everything was just terrific to me.

A sudden shake-off of the room which reveals the room is actually one container of 10 thousand people multi-complex. The show begins with an tremendous fashion. It appeals the player right away as if it is inviting them into the story.  And right away do you also feel the witty sarcasm which exists throughout the entire game. When the robot manager tell you: `This is art, stare at the art for 5 seconds.' and then plays classical music, it just makes me smile. The script writers are geniuses. The lines are comical but not too funny, and with a sense of dark humor. The robot themselves are always joking around with the death or termination of themselves, and sometimes to each other too. Almost childish but not overdone. Especially GLaDOS herself is a very charming character, I have to confess I fell in love with GLaDOS when she tried to talk Wheatley into a paradox, and mumbling 'dont think about it dont think about it'. It's just so cute.  The story and background setting are definitely deepened deliberately this time. When I played the first three chambers I was kind of worried they are just remaking Portal 1 - because I played 2 right after 1 so I could remember the puzzles as the same. Gladly they weren't! It's a fairly lengthy brand new game - about 8 hours - and every minute of it worths it. They put a lot of effort laying the background and showing the player how Aperture and the facility come to be. They laid huge architectural work for the game, I couldn't even imagine how big the facility is because it was so massive, there are so many rooms which you can't see the top end or the bottom end - which surprisingly reminds me of BioShock not at the time of playing but now. I've seen Valve done this large-world trick before in Half-Life 2, and I know they are getting good at it because this one is even better.  Music is great, not repetitive and well paced. Voice acting is tremendous, both Wheatley and GLaDOS.  The end game was also very good (and surprising!). I'm very happy that they didn't make the final boss very hard - after all, who would want to fight a difficult boss after solving all the puzzles? The tired player deserves a relaxed good show.  10/10, I haven't felt this kind of excitement for years, and Portal 2 brought it to me. It's a fine piece of work and I strongly recommended it.  Ps: I haven't played the multiplayer yet, but I heard it's very good too.",

Portal is a game series that I avoided like the plague when it was first announced by Valve, for no other reason than for the fact that it was popular and had nothing to do with the Half-Life series (or so I thought), so I just let is pass me like the wind. Eventually, I came across a sale on Steam that had the Entire Valve package for less than £30.00, which included the Portal Series, so since I had paid for them, I figured I may as well try them and well, I was not disappointed!  I loved the first Portal game, even though it was short, it had everything that I good game should have! Great game-play and a great story, and Portal 2 really improved upon everything that Portal 1 had to offer. There are practically zero faults that I have with this game.  It just goes to show that you should never judge a book by its cover and that just because something is popular, doesn't mean you should automatically dismiss it. The great game-play, storyline and endless fan chambers really do make this game worth paying for. Great job to everybody involved, it takes a lot to please me, but this was no contest!",

The level design is very well done and the story never seems to get boring, always something unpredictable, funny or dramatic will happen to keep your attention.   If the story line, which definetly is what makes this game so great, wasn't enough there is the co-op mode with workshop integration. The co-op mode takes place after the main story and is very well designed as well, you have much fun solving puzzles together with your partner in science. You can even steal your partner's head, smash him with spike plates or drop him in toxic waste. The workshop has many well made maps and original concept you can play if you completed the main co-op mode (which isn't that big).

It just added a certain specialty to the over all game. The only thing that I would say I 'didn't like' would be how difficult the puzzles were.

There's also a co-op mode which opens up even more possibilities to have an incredibly fun time in Portal 2.   Yes this game can be horribly frustrating. But it's for your own good because Portal 2 makes you smarter. Yes, smarter. There is no mindless shooting in this game. Instead there is intricate puzzles that will get that noggin of yours thinking away.  I could rant on forever about this phenomenal game but I'd be wasting your gameplay time.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.",

Positive Thing about this game - Nice Graphics - Like i said above the game can run on any pc basically - The Story is very decent, but you need to use your brain in it since it's a puzzle-platform - Possibility to play in Coop with one of your friends :) - We have a real story mode, instead of the first Portal which the story mode can be beat in 2 hours, When portal 2 is 7 hours long, but it's worth it  Bad things about this game  - Nothing i didn't encountered any bugs or found negative thing to say here  To finish  This game is a must have, like i said, the story mode is really awesome, and brain intensive LOL, So you need a puzzle-platform game ?!

Story:  You are a test subject called Chell in an underground testing facility called Aperture Science. Since the last game “Portal” after you killed GLaDOS (Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System) Aperture Science has been filled with vines, weeds, dirt and other junk. At the start you meet a personality core called Wheatley, you both want to escape from the collapsing Aperture Science. After awhile you and Wheatley have to go through GLaDOS’s Chamber, where she is broken and deactivated. But you and Wheatley pull some… well a lot… well all the switches turning GLaDOS back on, she grabs you and sends you through test chamber, after test chamber, after test chamber   Character:  The Characters in Portal 2 are memorable, with fantastic voice acting making you love the characters (even if they are against you). The Characters make you feel emotion, like feeling sorry for them and getting angry at them etc. The Characters have great and interesting character progression, and interesting backstories. The characters can make you laugh with funny humor (mainly Cave Johnson).   Models/Textures:  The models and textures in Portal 2 and improved a lot, the personality cores looks have been changed, now they look more realistic. The textures around the test chambers aren’t that white anymore, now looking brown because a lot of time has pasted since the last time you were in the these test chambers. The textures overall look pretty realistic, giving more life to Portal 2. The models are also very well made. GLaDOS has also gotten a makeover, making here able to express emotion not just through here words, but now here eyes.   Music:  The Portal 2 music is very atmospheric, making you feel boxed in and alone. The music in Portal 2 is noticeable different in style to the original Portal.   Easter Eggs/Secrets:  There are plenty of Easter eggs and secrets to find in Portal 2, and the return of the Doug Rattmann dens.   Conclusion:  In conclusion Portal 2 is a fantastic sequel to Portal. It has a great story, characters, textures and models. The ending is interesting and good, and has great puzzles to solve and different environments. I would say this is my favorite game I’ve played so far.   This Game gets a 10/10    Sorry for any spelling mistakes in this review. ",

The singleplayer experience is amazing; although the game takes place in a totally wrecked Aperture Laboratories, alluding to the - spoiler alert - destruction of GLADOS in  Portal , the plot of  Portal 2  remains independent, allowing the game to stand alone well.  In the game, the player is greeted by Wheatley, a spherical character who guides you through the Aperture Laboratories facility. As the game progresses, he/she is introduced to the game's identifying elements: the isolation placed upon the player by the enviroment, the Portal Gun, and GLADOS.  The player feels incredibly alone in this game: aside from Wheatley and GLADOS, the tester's assistant's voice and Cave Johnson's voice are the only other additional human elements in the game. He/she is left to solve the many puzzles that obstruct your path one after the other. As the game progresses, he/she is introduced to more and more puzzle elements, leading toward challenging 'test chambers' by the end of the game. The dreary soundtrack and lack of noise from Mother Nature leave the player to himself/herself and to solving the puzzle. The world manages to immerse the player in the deserted yet oddly realistic world that is Aperture Laboratories.  Solving 'test chambers' relies on the player utilizing the Portal Gun to the fullest. The Portal Gun, introduced to the player early in the game, allows him/her to teleport to various locations within a chamer in order to solve it. Passing through these chambers requires creativity, out-of-the-box thinking, and coordination: portals summoned by the Portal Gun maintain the velocity of anyone or anything flying through them.  GLADOS is a main character in the game but is not the guiding light to the plot like in  Portal . In  Portal 2 , the guiding light in the plot lies between the conflict with Wheatley and GLADOS; as the player advances in the game, he/she will learn what fueled this conflict and what its impact is on the story.  When one is finished with the singleplayer,  Portal 2  has additional content to keep the user busy. Challenge Mode offers the player the chance to complete an already solved puzzle in the fastest and most efficient way possible, focusing on using as little time and as few Portals as possible.  In addition, the game's multiplayer mode is as solid as the singleplayer mode. The multiplayer is an extension to the singleplayer story; the main characters are GLADOS and her two robotic test subjects Atlas and P-Body. Atlas and P-Body are tasked with working together to solve 'test chambers' that are otherwise unsolvable with only one person around. The emphasis on coordination is vital to winning the game; since the story is strictly two-man co-op, it is imperative that both players have an idea of what to do.  TIP: Keep a voice chat with your co-op buddy. One way of starting a voice chat is by clicking the arrow in the Steam overlay's chat window and clicking 'Start Voice Chat.'  After completing both the singleplayer and multiplayer game, the adventure does not stop. Ever since the game was linked with the Steam Workshop with the Perpetual Testing Iniative update in 2011, users have been submitting their own test chambers left and right. Many of these chambers are challenging and take liberties with level standards as well as throw in their own style in utilizing the game's elements. The game provides a level creation tool which is rather comprehensive; however, more sophisticated levels can be developed using the Hammer tool, a piece of software found in the Source SDK (Windows only).  The only problem I found with this game is that certain puzzles were hard; however, these puzzles were hard simply because I wasn't a great problem solver that time. Upon watching a walkthrough for the chambers I was stuck on, I realized that there was a practical solution to each and every one of them. Playing more puzzles allows players to become better at this game, and there are no levels in either of the main games that involve impossible-to-execute solutions.  I recommend this game highly to anyone interested in puzzle games in general. Valve has made this game have well-crafted and solvable levels and worlds, amazing aesthetics, a great soundtrack, and a sense of eternal fun. It is worth investing the twenty dollars as the experience is  truly  unforgettable.    Portal 2  is a puzzle game classic of the 2000's that should not be missed.   10/10. A+. 100%. P.S. In multiplayer, players can let their Atlas and/or P-Body characters wear hats (which is seen frequently in  Team Fortress 2 , another game by Valve).",

Even if you aren't a 'hardcore puzzle fan', you will love this game. I know this is probably what everyone else says, but come on it's Portal, you have to play it. The puzzles are challenging, and make you think in ways you haven't thought of before, where you have to think outside the box to solve each puzzle. The best part about the puzzles though, is that after a while you don't have a guide, and have to learn new aspects of the puzzle by yourself, even though before you had had someone to help you through. The storyline is amazing, making you feel as if you were inside the game, and giving you a personalized experience although millions have played it already.

Then there is the community maps, the Single player maps are good (unless they are not) there are a lot of good mappers for Portal 2 (even myself, I'm not good, but I do make good maps) anyway, then there is the Co-op community maps, they (just like the SP maps) are good if the mapper is good at making it, I've seen a lot of terrible chambers when I played SP maps, then there are the amazing mappers that feel like they should have worked on the game.  Now, let's move onto the In-game map editor, it's super simple to use, and there are videos on YouTube or there are guides in the steam workshop to help you, heck, there are even some Portal 2 Peti mods if you don't want to use Hammer (I call it that because it's easy to remember) now, Hammer is a more advanced mapping tool, but you can do so much more with it then peti (why is that Valve?) and there are YouTube videos and Steam guides to teach you, I have started to map in hammer, it's hard at first, but once you get the hang of it, it's a piece of cake.

The new gel mechanics are pretty cool as well. Overall it plays exactly like Portal did, as a first-person puzzler. Portal 2 is truly incredible and stands alongside Half-Life 2 in Valve's hall of great games. Setting is even better than the first game, as it's still Aperture Science, but broken down and depressing. Portal 2 is also quite a bit longer than the original, and the story is constantly twisting and changing while incorporating the trademark humor the series is known for. Portal 2 is one of the best games of all time, as far as I'm concerned. 9.75/10, do buy.",

            "review_text": "Although the game is more than 5 years old, Portal 2 is still good to this day. The puzzles, (as long as you don't know the solution) are very intuitive and thought provoking. Not to mention, that the addition to the gel, gravity beams, etc. Are interesting and is a great puzzle mechanic besides just cubes, buttons, and portals. The graphics are still acceptable to this day, but concidering Portal 2 came out in 2007, it was amazing at the time. The addition of co-op is ingenious, irrelevant if you actually have a friend to play with or not, should still be a welcome thing. Not to mention, when you DO have a friend to play with, and assuming they actually cooperate (Get it, co-op?), it is very fun, probably even more than the single player game. Speaking of single player, the main campain is very interesting, and the story is interesting, with a midway plot twist, and technically a side-plot. Completing the game, (In other words, getting all of the acheivments) Is very possible and actually kind of fun to do. It's almost like trying to find all of the content compared to actually using ~ amazing skills ~ to get any of the achievments. (Except for the time trails). The community maps can add difficulty to those who actually want the difficulty, instead of the achievments. What a hard, almost impossible puzzle? Look through some of the community maps. Or make one, that works too. Anyways, the music works really well with the atmosphere of the game. The music typically comes up whenever you happen to come across a puzzle, especially in the test chambers. What I loved about the music in Portal 2 is when you are flying through the air, whether because of the blue or orange gel, or because of the launch pads, overlapping music that would sound awesome on its own matching the existing music and it sounds great! The music itself sounds amazing to. The techno music fits the futuristic, robot apocalyptic atmosphere perfectly. The atmosphere itself makes the game just standout not only as a puzzle game, but as an adventure game, too. One of the main reasons I didn't go insane while I was trying to figure out a puzzle is the story, which is amazing on its own right. The story, (No spoilers don't worry) is set in a robotic apocalyptic setting, where the robots have taken over. You are a lab rat, going through experiment after experiment. Things have changed since the first game though. Everything is rotten, plants are overgrowing alot of it, and everything just seems discombobulated (is that a word?); and the atmosphere reflects this perfectly.  Overall, the game is very good, but for me, it was short lived. But, with Co-op and community maps, and the workshop enabled, this game can last quite a while. Even if you do play the entire game in one sitting, I guarantee that one sitting would last for more than 24 hours.  Edit: I was really bad at analyzing games more than a year ago. Don't feel liking deleting or changing this though. idk.",

            "review_text": "8/10 Good continuation off of Portal, also has some fun and challenging chambers. The Perpetual Testing Initiative also lets players create their own chambers without having to know much about Hammer or any of those fancy things. There's only two parts that annoy me: 1. Controller support. They say it has FULL support for 'em, but most of the UI of the Testing Initiative does not work, like in example when you've already subscribed to one or more chambers, pressing DPAD UP or DOWN or moving the joystick at all after having selected 'Play singleplayer chambers' does totally nothing. Also, if you were to accidentally select Robot Loadout on the main menu with the controller, go get your mouse. You will not be able to exit it with your gamepad. The mouse isn't hidden while using the controller (in-menus), which is honestly  VERY  annoying since when in menus, it usually selects what's in the middle of the screen. In gameplay itself, however, it's good. You can at least customize the controls, but sometimes, it doesn't work and you gotta toggle between Default 1 and Custom until it finally updates. The part that you can't make chambers with the controller is understandable...enough.  2. Splitscreen Co-op on one computer. It just throws you right into the game, completely ignoring wether you're a CS:GO pro or a COD noob. No co-op intro. No nothing. You don't get any keybind/controller hints in the intro of the game like you do in the retail version, either...you gotta figure out how to go back to bed yourself. Not that that troubles me, but...  'For your convenience, all the test chambers are now unlocked.'  -The Announcer    Now, for the pros. It's got a good story line, continues off of Portal, except several years after 'murdering' GLaDOS, and has a round Personality Sphere called Weedly, who apperently does not smoke. (Yes, that was a lie. His real name is Wheatley) Only thing bad about the story is they have no more cake. It is never mentioned. NO. CAKE!  Graphics-wise, great. To be 2011. This isn't exactly a next-gen game, but it's okay. Only thing I don't get, is how you shoot Portals. The gun doesn't even have a bloody trigger. It doesn't have a clean trigger either. Hand transplant?  There's lots of new gameplay on here, including in the intro, which includes old chambers from Portal and some new ones which are original. Except on certain chambers later in the game, I just sat there. And started at all corners of a chamber. I was like 'What the (BEEP) am I supposed to do!?' and forced myself after 2 hours of thinking to go to the Portal 2 wiki just to find out the answer was obvious. That's what I usually call the 'Legend of Zelda effect'. Not saying you'll end up like that, but just might happen. Certain chambers just require you to act fast as *BEEP*, so if you're 'simple-minded, old, or just irradiated in such a way the future should  not  start with you,' or don't know how to move a camera, don't play this.  Total rating (ignoring the lack of controller support on most areas of the UI): 8/10. Also, a quick note...if you own two Wireless xbox 360 gamepads and have an adapter, or own 2 wired gamepads, you can play splitscreen co-op with yourself if you're a loner. Just saying. Or real-life friends. That's just if you don't have Steam friends to play with...",

I did find myself, however, annoyed a few times because I was stuck on some of the none-test chambers (I'm trying to be vague so I don't ruin any of the story), and usually when I'm stuck I just need to think about where I'm going (for example if I need to get on to a high platform where the exit is and there aren't any portal servers there I know I need to look for a place to gain momentum), but sometimes I didn't even I didn't even know that (luckily that was only twice). One more thing I'd like to mention, is that I don't exactly have a gaming Computer (my graphics card, the hardware mainly responsible for FPS, Is an integrated Intel HD Graphics 3000), yet, this game runs smoothly with the texture quality on high, the shader on high, and and everything else on normal (also I don't mean the kind of 'smoothly' people use when they have a really bad computer and they get 20 FPS on a game as oppose to 8, I'm talking about 40-60 FPS with a graphics card meant for surfing the internet on mid - high graphics)",

There are a lot more levels and new mechanics to master:  -Excursion Funnels - beams that allow you to travel along the path they create. -Aerial plates, which launch you. -Light bridges - they create a bridge made of light which you can walk on. -Gels - liquids that have different effects such as making you faster or helping you jump higher. And these are just to name a few.  The boss battle keeps the same style from the first game.  Portal 2 also contains a CO-OP player campaign which requires you and another player. You take the role of either Atlas or P-Body which are created by Glados. Levels are specially desgined to make use of the 2 player count.

            "review_text": "Dustforce truly is a work of art. I don't mean that lightly. The way it's animated plus its music gives it that title in my book. I can find myself playing one level for an hour, maybe even hours at a time. The frustration of losing levels is filled with relaxation and calmness because of the ambient music. The way the levels are crafted is truly mindblowing. They had a system in which you had to perfect a level to earn a key, and you would use that key to earn more levels. In layman's terms, to earn more levels, you had to perfect current levels. They ditched that and added an XP system in which you gain more XP to earn a key the more levels you play and perfect. I'm very glad they added this system and was skeptical about buying it. But now that I did buy it, I do not regret it even for a second. One thing I really love about this game is how you don't have to unlock base levels. In a sense, this game is open world. That sense is that many levels are available to you, and you can choose whether you want to advance into more challenging levels, or stay where you're at. To get an S in completion, you have to sweep up EVERY leaf, and to get an S in Finesse, you have to maintain your combo throughout an entire level.   Another thing I absolutely enjoy about Dustforce is its expasive community. There are lots of Community Workshop maps for you to sharpen your skills on, and lots of people who can set a good example. I'm sure most of the people who get best times on all the levels have a Youtube channel, so you can probably catch them there. The community may or not be active, but it sure is good and friendly.  Overall, in terms of gameplay, music, artstyle, animation, and difficulty (it's not an easy game, but it's not that hard of a game either. It just depends on how much you want to play it), I rate this game:  10/10 BUY THIS GAME. ",

Now even when you've finished the story AND the co-op, theres still more, unbelievable, the Steam workshop is implemented to portal 2 and you can download test chambers that the community has made, and of course you can make your own aswell!.  For bad points in this game, there really arent any I can think off the top of my head, honestly I really cant come up with one.  If I were you, i'd buy this game, its worth your money, this game ist for everybody, but even so try it, you wont regret it.",

My only complain is that you don't have the feeling that you are in a human body: you are just a floating camera with no visible arms or legs, no head bobbing. Dark Messiah of Might and Magic has implemented all these features perfectly, and it is based on the Source engine so there is no excuse for Valve. Moreover, the character doesn't make any sound, not even a grunt after a long fall or when getting wounded. All this breaks a bit the immersion, and that's a sad thing.",

I like to be able to imagine I am the character in a game, in the scenario created, and escape into that world for a while. Half Life 2 failed for me, and Portal made the same errors. In this case: the game begins with you waking up. And you seem to have had radical surgery, with metal bolted onto your bones. Don't you think you would examine that? Check your legs? Is it bolted or strapped on? Could it be removed and you restored to a normal body, or are you permanently disfigured? Does it hurt to walk on it? To fall 50 feet and land on it? The game doesn't answer any of this, meaning I was immediately removed from the character. Either she had information that hadn't been shared with the player (making it difficult to _be_ her in the game), or she somehow doesn't notice or comment upon the fact that she may have been mutilated in her sleep (again, making it impossible to empathise with the character). This could have easily been rectified by a few seconds of close-up, maybe a wince; perhaps later a comment on it, or a sign about the surgery. To gloss over something that would be so major in a person's life is bizarre.'  I also noticed (which I don't remember from Portal 1) that picking up the portal gun now gives you X-ray vision. You can see where portals are even when they're out of sight, through walls. It is often confusing (sometimes they looked like the gun sights); unnecessary (it wasn't useful to me in the slightest); and it made no sense (the character wasn't looking through special sights on the gun or anything like that). I wouldn't have minded if it was a feature you could turn off, but I couldn't find any such setting in the menu.  Again, the actual puzzling is generally okay, but weird things like that kept distracting me.",

Yet remembering how revolutionary the first Portal was, it’s hard not to blame Portal 2 for its lost potential. A bigger budget and a bigger team, but the result is an uninspired sequel riding on the popularity of the original.  The story in the first Portal , and the progression of environments made sense. First you where a test subject, then you escaped and made your own way around the facility to finally fight GLaDOS. Hints that something was off with Aperture were subtle and built tension. The length was just right, you could complete it in one breathtaking sitting.  In Portal 2 you simply “follow the rail” as the helpful robot with an awful British accent (and forced humor) tells you. References to the original are in-your-face, everything lacks subtlety or any kind of suspense. At least puzzles rise up in difficulty nicely, if a bit slowly. It’s hard to get used to hand-holding popups and NPCs suggestions though. It’s a puzzle game, I want to figure this stuff out, OK?  Sure, the visuals are nicer, but that doesn’t really add anything to the game play. Unfortunately from the technology point of view Portal 2 has a major flaw: the loading screens. Loading between levels takes longer than in the original and there are now immersion-destroying separate loading screens. Both chase sequences in the game are also broken up with the loading screens. The funny thing is: elevators are still here. Yep, Portal 2 has both an elevator and a loading screen between levels.  Ultimately it’s just more of the same. Portal 2 doesn’t push any boundaries, it’s a high fidelity bonus pack to Portal. Sadly it’s nowhere near as important as the first Portal. You can go to  Portal Memories  to explore interesting environments or to  Portal Pro  for some real challenge.  Funny thing is that I’ve seen this before. It’s the same kind of thing that happened to BioShock. It was supposed to be a worthy successor to System Shock 2. Developers of both Portal 2 and BioShock made the game accessible to a wide audience. Both games achieved the same level of “critical acclaim” (top spot on metacritic in their year of release). Yet both lost the soul of its predecessor.  If you’re looking for a spiritual successor then it’s clearly somewhere else.",

However, the co-op manages to provide a more satisfying experience in both gameplay and atmosphere, and the perpetual testing initiative is a very cool idea with an easy-to-use but powerful editor.

Actually in most areas I would give the game a 7/10. I don't see any one single aspect that I would rate at 9.  - Technically the game is OK, the 3D 'Source' engine is serviceable but a bit dated. Most items and environments have very geometrical shapes, don't expect fancy light or particles effects. More annoying are the many loading times even for small levels. Before AND after each level there is a similar 'lift' sequence, which quickly get repetitive and boring, and only add extra loading times.  - The designers made commendable efforts on the gfx style and story telling. The robotics voice acting are a mix of joke/taunt/background story/hint, however I don't find they were relly funny, but rather annoying. Nevertheless you shouldn't turn the voices off for fear of missing a helpful hint. Overal I wasn't captivated by the atmosphere and the plot, and all the cutscenes was more a distraction than anything else  - There are no manual or tutorial, instead there are some visual and speech hints, but this is the kind of game where understanding the rules and mechanisms is part of the puzzles. Not a big issue, but sometimes a cause for irritation.  - Basically each level is a small closed room where you must open and reach the exit. Rooms are mostly empty, and only contain a very few items relevant to the solution. Indeed the first puzzle are rather easy once you get the idea of the game. Then in the second third of the game, the levels become larger and more open, and feels like an abandonned factory. This introduce an element of exploration. Unfortunately the environment is completly passive (except for a very obvious levers), and even if you explore every remote corners you won't find anything of interest. In the end you roam long corridors and scaffolders, which only dilute the puzzle solving aspect of the game. And most of this part is pretty linear and boring with many repetitive puzzles, and some dexterity challenges.   - The final part of the game revert back to the puzzle rooms and is more interesting with some good and challenging puzzle.  - The single player mode took me 11h to complete. There is also a cooperative 2 player mode which is a different experience (of little interest for me as I have a poor connection and play mostly solo). Additionaly there are many users created contents which add to the experience. Considering the price this is a decent amount of content. But overal I find the game didn't lived up to the hype and there are other puzzle game that I found more enjoyable.",

            "review_text": "Some of the negative reviews here aren't too detailed, so I'll try my best to change that. I'd like to offer some valid reasons why I can't recommend this game. Of course they're my personal observations, and the issues won't affect everyone, but they could affect *you*.   Major Issue: Bugs   Bugs in over 35% of the wretched puzzle rooms. Whether it was pixel hunting for the correct atom of usable wall to pop a portal on, or the game presenting busted mechanics you cannot work around as there is only one solution to everything. Sometimes repeating the same action five times would result in four failures and one success. Most of the time I had to reload an older save to start that area all over again, hoping that this time the puzzle would be functional. In a puzzle game, these bugs are not so much game-breaking as fun-breaking. I only realised something was amiss when I consulted a YouTube walkthrough, and found out I was doing the right thing but the game was bugged.   I'm now stuck on (what feels like) the nadir of the game. I'm in a glitched puzzle where Stephen Merchant keeps yammering at me in an attempt to be funny. This room (Wheatley puzzle 17 I think, blue tunnel of light going horizontally) has murdered the game for me. I just don't have the interest in it to bother completing this room. Tried the video walkthroughs, but guess what? The wall others can use, I can't! To play a game where I can't tell when it's bugged or not is literally gaming torture.   Second smaller gripe: Stephen Merchant's voice acting. Holy flurking schnit, who thought this was a good idea?! I'm English, but this man's voice gets on my nerves, let alone his awful attempt at jokes and ad-libbing. With all the reloading I've had to do, I've heard his rotten material probably sixty times more than other players.  Multiplayer wasn't free of bugs either, and after trying it once I didn't return to it for a very good reason. Whether it was lag or bugs/glitches, bits of these puzzles didn't work either. Marvellous!    Summation   If you are intent on getting the game, I'd heartily recommend getting it discounted. Of course, you may not experience these bugs. My friends didn't - their run through was completely fine. Nor can I explain why over 50% of the game bugged out. The faulty turret puzzle was the first major issue that halted progress for days, as the only cure was reloading old saves before I had entered a 'bugged' area. Can you imagine how much of a pain that was, having to reload whole areas because one room's puzzle wouldn't let me through? There are no backdoors or workarounds, so when something goes wrong, it completely blocks your progress.  I really wanted to enjoy this game, as there are some really good elements. I loved controlling the liquid so I could make new portals. I didn't have a problem with this element at all, and it was lovely to experience it working properly. The super-bouncy areas were a lot of fun too. I also enjoyed seeing the roots of Aperture Science, and GLAdOS's history.   The bugs utterly ruined it for me. You can't afford to have bugs in a puzzle game that requires precision, timing, and thought from the player: It's like performing surgery with a carrot instead of a scalpel. ",

Waking up years after the first ends; the facility is in major disarray and GlaDOS is awake and still on a mission to kill you; for science! Rather than just a few puzzle rooms; this game has an entire facility. You finally get the unimaginable scope of how big the center was. And just when you think the game is over and you've defeated GlaDOS; well, the game is just getting started.   It's a game that redefined gaming; how you can take a bunch of really cool concepts and build not just a game out of it; but an entire world. Everyone's raved about this game, and for good reason; it's *THAT* good. It's also relatively family friendly; a rarity in todays gaming world. There's no real blood; you don't shoot anything but Portals; and the only time you die is when computerized turrets shoot you. Replace the violence for complex puzzles, add a big old glob of humor and you get Portal 2.  Buy it; play it. If you don't like it, then you're not a human.",

The comedy is spot on, the game-play is perfect, I love this game so much, I played it's single player twice in the same week.  There's only 2 problems I have with P2. Firstly the music, the music is the 1st Portal made you felt like you was alone in the test chambers, no sign of life. The music in P2 is wonderful, don't get me wrong, but I don't get that same feeling of lonelyness I got in the last game due to it. Second problem, no references to cakes.

I honestly don’t know what grabbed me, but as soon as I blinked, I was addicted.   Now, I hear all the negativity that can come with saying that one thinks Portal 2 is better than Portal, but honestly, if I’d played Portal first, I wouldn’t have bought as much merchandise as I have sitting in my house right now. It’s the kind of game that makes you WANT to contribute as much of your money to as possible, because it’s that great of a game.   I love gifting this game to other Steam players (as well as Portal, but I particularly love giving out this game twice as much). It’s not a game many people should miss out on, and if you love puzzles and verbal abuse from an AI, this game is definitely something you should buy (even at full price).   GLaDOS is waiting.

The story manages to be both hilarious and serious (but mostly hilarious). If someone were to ask me who was my favorite character, I wouldn't know where to start! Wheatley would have to be the worlds greatest moron for his horrible ideas and hilarious frantic personality. Not only is GLaDOS's name fun to type, but there has never been a better villain/antihero/AI. But Cave Johnson would have to be one of my favorites. He's the only supporting character who doesn't hate you or try to kill you, mainly because he's already dead! Also, his attempts to do anything legal or illegal for science make's his character even more likeable. Ok, back to the game. Even when your done with the singleplayer and co-op stories, there is still so much to do! The Perpetual Testing Initiative allows you to create your own test chamber (which might end up crappy) and upload it to the workshop for all to test it! This also gives you an Apperture nametag with your Steam profile pic to make it look like you work at Apperture. Also, you can here quotes from Cave Johnson (who, in this multiverse, is alive (another reason I love him)) whenever you start a community test. Cave's quote and the Apperture name tag make you feel like your an actual part of the story. This game is a 10/10.",

Valve struck gold in 2007 with the release of The Orange Box, a package which indluded games like Half-Life 2 and the episodes, Team Fortress 2, and Portal. Portal was an experiment, and yet was acclaimed as one of the most original games of that year. Developement of a sequel began right away. Usually it's difficult to live up to such an incredible game in a sequel, but Portal 2 showed just how good a sequel can be. An extended story, more characters and character development, and the almighty GLaDOS. The puzzles were increased in quantity, quality, and length. The gameplay was suberb, the story was even better, managing to not take itself seriously in some parts, and still managing to be serious where it needs to be. All in all, 9.9/10. Why 9.9?

If it makes you feel any better, science has now validated your birth mother’s decision to abandon you on a doorstep.” – GLaDOS  In Portal 2, you (Chell) find yourself in a hotel room of sorts where you just woke up from hibernation. The story element and the humor from the characters you become involved with are truly what make the game great. I find the puzzle element to be simply a bonus. I won’t give away what happens in Portal 2, you’ll have to find out for yourself. I will say however that GLaDOS does make a comeback and you are introduced to a humorous AI program named “Wheatley.”  The game is much, much longer than its predescesor…you’ll find yourself playing this game for at least a few hours. Some of the puzzles were tricky, especially the later ones that brought lasers and different kinds of slime into the mix. The new features and environments help keep the game fresh while the story unfolds to its final conclusion.  For those of you who enjoy teaming up with a friend, you’ll be happy to know that there is a Co-Op mode that allows two players to tackle puzzles together. The Co-Op mode was designed separately from the main game so the puzzles you and your partner will face are completely new and just as likely to leave you scratching your head. Each player gets a portal gun, meaning you can have up to four portals in the test chambers at once. Most puzzles are designed around this, making you both coordinate your portals and movements in order to advance to the next room.  Easy to recommend to anyone who enjoys puzzles and interacting with psychotic AIs.",

P2 gives the player a richly deeper story dive into the Appature Science facility further cementing the story crafting of Valve. The game is full exhilarating moments and witty comedy including the top notch performance by Stephen Merchant.   The addition of the multiplayer gameplay is something very common these days, except Portal 2 adds a different twist to with this one. The multiplayer environment allows 2 players to join together to tackle a myriad of 'test chambers' specifically designed for 2 players.   This game is a great mixture of fun and story. A true must have for gamers of any level.",

Let's see.  　STILL ALIVE?  　　The game begins with the fact that Chell along with her new partner, personality module Wheatley, is trying to escape from an abandoned Aperture Science laboratory. Throughout the game, the plot makes a interesting twists. Individual deserves compliments perfect finale, after which there remain only a warm feeling. In Portal 2 no epic stories, huge explosions, incredible action, or the salvation of humanity. Instead, there is a charismatic characters, intelligent humor and interesting puzzles.  　ONE IS GOOD, BUT TWO IS BETTER  　　One of the achievements of the new Portal has been the emergence of the cooperative. Co-op story is a continuation of the plot of the single player. At first I thought that the only difference of the cooperative is the presence of two players with portal-guns, instead of one. In fact, the cooperative has unique ideas. Many puzzles solving quite differently. I advise you not to play cooperative with a random person (there is that possibility), and play it with a good friend.  　ENDLESS TESTS  　　In game was added a level editor, so anyone can create their own test chambers or try to play the levels of other players. To be honest, most of the player-created levels are too simple or ridiculous. But there is sufficient interesting maps (and some of them really hard). In no case do not miss the community maps.  　Multiplayer: 　　Online: Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ  　　Co-op: ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺O 　Storyline: ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺O 　Graphics: ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺O 　Gameplay: ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺  　  　Complexity of the achievements: All achievements can be easily earned (if you have good friend for the co-op) in the one-two walkthrough.  　　　　VALVE made another good 　　game. With good intelligent humor, 　　charismatic characters and unusual 　　interesting gameplay.  　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　As expected, nine out of ten [9/10].",

            "review_text": "Portal 2 - A Unique Masterpiece: I'm gonna try to do something that no one ever seems to do, which is write a serious reveiw. Of course, that means that its gonna look either really cheesy or cool, probably both...  I first got Portal 2 on the Xbox 360, and probably got a good 50 hours or so out of it, finishing the single player and multiplayer campaigns. Then, I saw it on computer, and saw that it had a level editor, so I bought it on sale, and essentially payed 5$ for the editor. And now I have over 200 hours on it. That alone speaks for how much I love this game.   Gameplay: The gameplay is incredibly unique, and very fun. Everything you do in this game revolves around portals. The game's tutorial doesn't feel like one at all, and teaches you the beginings of 'Thinking with Portals'. The tutorial is in 3 parts over the games first chapter, but its more like an exploration of the concept than a tutorial. First, you use buttons to activate preset portals, then you get a gun that can shoot one portals, then you get the true Portal Gun. The introduction is simple enough for beginners to understand, but engaging enough that series veterans won't be bored out of their minds. As you progress through the game, you will start to solve tests with test 'elements'. These elements are things like lasers and cubes, which all interact with portals, and each other in unique ways. Each test chamber uses an element in a new way, to keep them from being stale. You travel through multiple parts of Aperture, all unique in their own way. You explore much more than just Aperture and it's factory, unlike the original. However, the campaign is very short (5-7) hours, and once you beat it, there is really no reason to replay it. The multiplayer is also fun, if you can find a friend to play it with. Playing with random people can be very unpredictable, but if you can find a friend, you'll have a good time. It adds more hours to the game, which is very welcome. The good news is once you beat the game, there are an infinite number of Community puzzles to try out.  Story: This game has a way deeper story than the original. It surpases it in practically all ways. The plot is longer, has more twists, and is more exciting. The characters are more engaging and humorous. Although there are only three of them, they are all memorable and unique. GLaDOS ends up taking a back seat to the two new characters however, in humor and in design. The characters and dialogue are one of the most memorable things about this game.  Level Editor: The in-game level editor (PTI Editor) will be where most of the community makes their puzzles. This editor will be where all beginner mappers will make their first puzzles. This editor is very easy to use, but is also quite simple. You can design simple chambers with basic elements, but to do anything unique and visually impressive, you need to use Hammer. Hammer is the powerful map-making tool that all of the best mappers use. It is also very confusing to any begginers. It will probably take a while to figure out how to make simple room, and it is way more complicated to make lights or doors or cube droppers. I speak from experience, as a wanna-be-mapper who was tired of the lack of content in PTI. If you can master Hammer, you will be able to easily become a fan-favorite mapper. When it comes to other people's maps though, you will be hard pressed to find quality ones. There is a good amount in top-rated of all time, but once you have done a lot of those, you will find that 95% of the maps are incredibly easy, PTI maps, or just plain impossible.   Pro/Con Summary (For those who don't want to read):  Pros: Hilarious dialogue Fun multiplayer One of a kind experience Infinite amount of community chambers to play Includes Hammer editor, in which you can make incredibly detailed and amazing puzzles Great progression of test elements, never gets stale Difficulty curve is not too steep or slow Good visual diversity considering the setting  Cons: Not much replay value A very short experience It can be hard to find quality community puzzles The PTI editor is simple, but lacking in content, while hammer allows you to make anything, while being complex. espeically for beginners",

As a platformer/puzzle game, as a sequel, but simply as a game, Portal 2 is ‘all across the board’ a phenomenal achievement!   It’s easily twice as long as Portal and with more humor to go with that extra length. Co-op missions have also been added for additional gameplay and there is now an even crazier use of physics-based puzzle solving elements thrown into the mix, most notably with the addition of liquids that allow you/other objects to bounce (blue liquid), move faster (orange liquid) and create portals on surfaces you normally couldn’t utilize for that purpose (white liquid) – not gonna go into specifics on that or when that even factors into the game’s campaign but for certain Portal 2 is a wild ride fraught with wacky antics, danger, intrigue and….umm….potatoes (yeah, not gonna go into that either and spoil anything for ya!

I mean, even if they hit you, they don't kill you. And if u die, by jumping into the toxic water, u get respawned right away, nearby. The game doesn't seem really punishing.

The gameplay is still amazing. there are new lots of new gameplay elements (such as the various gels) that increase the complexity of puzzles, which still remain challenging yet never in a frustrating way. Level designs are great and are just so fun.   The best thing though about this game is the depth of the outstanding story. All the characters are fascinating and of course hilarious.  There are so many unexpected twists in the story and Portal 2 truly has a brilliant start, middle and end - oh the end is so good. Many still complain about the length of the game which is about double the length of the first game, and while it can be completed in an afternoon I think the length is absolutely perfect. There's ton of content on the workshop anyway as well as co-op :P  So definitely buy this game, pretty much everyone has already anyway, i just wanted to say how much i love it.

The original Portal never felt like a full fledged game to me, more of a puzzle like Fez or Spelunky if brought to 3D (minus the colors and style). The gun was it's main selling point, and people were hooked by the mental exercise. Soon, the internet lit up with 'backstories' and theories on who the heck you played as and why GLaDOS is such a sadistic but lovable voice you could never get out of your head.  Portal 2 took the puzzling teleportation we liked and put it in a more story-driven adventurous setting. While you still (in a rough sense) navigate the similar rooms of the Aperture Science labs, there is an amazing amount of various places you'll be hopping around in. Not to mention the plethora of easter eggs You could sit around on Youtube for hours watching all of the videos on them!  All in all, the first Portal is a speedrunner's dream, not worth skipping if you haven't already played it. Portal 2 decided to take the addicting portal puzzles and put them in an adventurous setting with a better story (now on a Half-Life level) and unforgettable characters, some of which you will never even see their faces but recognize their dialouge or text anywhere on the internet.  Why are you reading this? You should've been playing this years ago!",

Nah, keep expanding Team Fortress 2 like mad instead.  2012: Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Because I guess it was time to overhaul that instead of making Half-Life 2 Episode 3.  2013: DOTA 2.

First of I would like to say that the basic mechanics are very good and are interesting because they have not really been explored before in any game. I will break this review down into several parts but it will not be too long.  Story- you may think a puzzle game like this may not have a good story but its better than good. Its easy to understand but has enough twists and turns to make this story engaging and interesting. It is also full of jokes that are quite subtle and some not so subtle. My favourite character was wheatly (played by steven merchant) as he was funny and kind of adorable in parts. But Glad0s was also halarious and intreging as she occasionally gives you clues about your parents.  Gameplay- It gives you very little to play with at the outset but as the game pushes forward it gets a lot harder and gives you more means to complete the chambers. It gives you a new mechanic, lets you master it and then introduces you to more and this repeats throughout the game to keep portal from getting stale.  Graphics- Runs on the source engine (sorry if I am wrong) which is what most if not all of valves games use. The graphics are very simple but timeless as the is never much colour in most of the game in this bleak, torn apart testing facility. Portal 2 will run on most computers and runs on my laptop which runs games like complete crap.  Extra- There is little to no lore in the portal universe at the moment but they still hav loads of good easter eggs like singing turrets and the lab rat location which are really eerie and creepy. I love the music for portal and have bought the soundtrack for portal and portal 2. This is my favourite valve game along with left 4 dead 2 and I would recomend it to pretty much anyone.

It has interesting lore [spiler](such as the neurotoxin flood and carolines death)[/spoiler] that I have spent hours researching. The gameplay is also wonderful (wonderfull?) the tests are well built and challenging. There are also plenty of amazing easter eggs such as the ratt man dens. The graphics are also amazing. The game looks so real that if I wasn't controlling it (and if everythign in it wasn't so impossible) I would easily mistaken it for a real video or something. I also like the overgwon plants and panels trying to put themselves together. Overall portal 2 is an amazing game and I would reccomend it to anyone who wants to challenge themselves.",

When you finally make it to Glados so you can put Wheatley in charge and escape, something bad happens...  You continue literally from the bottom and make your way to Wheatley. You get to discover some of the history of the whole place, while solving a brain-scratching puzzles.  As I said, an EPIC story with EPIC sounds and musics, but I think that isn't enough to describe the whole EPICness. You really should test this game out, but here's a tip: don't give up, if the chambers feel hard ;). I spent a lot of time in them, but when you finally make it through, I can say, it was way more than worth it.  I don't remember much about the first Portal so I can not recommend to play it first, but I highly recommend you to play this one.  Thank you for you time.  PS: This game also doesn't require that much from a PC. I mean, my PC is built from pretty old components (Intel Core 2 Duo, GTX 650), and it's stuck at 60 FPS.",

The first time I played this game, it felt like I was falling in a dark pit, surrounded by pitch black nothingness. Second time, it got unnoticably brigther, but brighter still.  Then there's co-op. After my brother beat the game about 5 hours before me, he suggested we play co-op. Then he went to our grandparents house, and my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ self couldn't figure out how to wave so that stalled us from playing. But when I finally did figure out how to, we were then caught in other problems. Couldn't get out of the chamber. Thankfully, my idea came to the rescue! I felt so intelligent when I was able to get us out of that infuriating chamber with that one little dumb idea I had.  Really, the most infuriating part of this game is when your hands are starting to sweat or your fingers accidentally slip and you go whoosh! into the water, to your death. I can hear GLaDOS and her monotone voice as I type, mocking each little thing I do, or her arrogant voice during her little chats in the elevator ride or while you're sprinting down a hallway or something.

Bottom line:   Portal 2 is a very unique game, it provides something different, which in itself is a reason to buy it. So many game designers poorly re-invent the same themes and ideas year after year but to see something unique coupled with gliding graphics and an interesting storyline makes Portal 2 a great addition to your gaming library.

Everything looks really pretty and the effects look really good, without trying too hard, also making it so from a far they don't look bad in a weaker computer... For the sound, dear lord the sound is amazing, it's so immersive and it feels right... I never have epic music when I'm in a quiet part when i'm solving a puzzle, and accordingly I never have silence in an epic part... But the quietness while solving the puzzles makes it so you can really enjoy how awesome all the sound effects are... The Co-op campaign was extremely fun to play with a friend, the 4 portal system makes really harder puzzles, and the ability to kill your friend at some points followed by Gladus's commentaries creates really humorous parts... And finally the story, without any doubt Portal 2's strongest point, it's immersive, funny, creative, not too long, not too short, doesn't have time wasters... It's just epic...

It's not that I think the developer has put a foot wrong so far, or that its latest release won't meet the impossibly high expectations of its audience. On the whole, the titles that Valve has produced have been critically lauded and have sold very respectably.  But if the history of art and entertainment has taught us one thing it is this: if you habitually make genius look easy, audiences and critics will round on you if you stumble, even more viciously than they would have done if your track record was of a mediocre quality. Valve's winning streak has to get snapped at some point, doesn't it? And if it does, the knives will be out in force.  Well, thankfully, Portal 2 isn't the game that's going to cause this, which is remarkable when you consider it's arguably the sequel of 2011 with the toughest act to follow. The first Portal, released in 2007 as part of the Orange Box, was a short, ingenious puzzler wrapped up in first-person-shooter mechanics, underpinned by a darkly comic story about scientific research taken to dangerous extremes. The game seemed like lightning in a bottle and a sequel sounded unnecessary. Still, Valve has managed to go one better than what its team created before, and then built on its impressive foundations.  Portal 2 kicks off with player waking up in the Aperture Laboratories, the human behaviour research facility from the first game, and finding out very quickly that things have gone haywire. Aperture is a wreck: without GlaDOS – Portal 1's female AI antagonist – to run things, the facility is in an advanced state of disrepair. Walls are crumbling, test chambers malfunction and every room the player moves through is riddled with smashed windows, natural overgrowth and broken machinery. In the opening stages of the game, players are introduced to Wheatly, a stammering, motor-mouthed droid voiced by Stephen Merchant, and reacquainted with the Portal Gun, which creates interconnecting portals capable of bending distances, and physics, in their environment.    They're also soon reunited with GlaDOS, who takes umbrage at their presence and decides that a new round of potentially lethal tests is in order.  While the set-up will sound incredibly familiar to Portal veterans, Portal 2 is hardly a retread of the first game. Yes, using the Portal Gun to navigate one's way through every new environment is the core premise of the game – and cubes, gun turrets, floating platforms and pressure pads all make a return. But Valve has added some mind-bending mechanics and tools to the mix.  As the player advances through the Apeture Labs they're introduced to new items that the research facility has created to exercise their grey matter and potentially kill them off. There are Hard Light Bridges, which can create walkways or block off the sensors of lasers and gun turrets. There are Aerial Faith Plates, which fling the player through the air. There's Propulsion Gel, which allows them to zoom across the floor, building momentum for jumps and portal leaps. Puddles of Repulsion Gel can create areas the player can bounce on– and the higher the ledge they drop from, the higher they'll fly through the air. White Gel can be sprayed on to surfaces to make them Portal Gun-friendly. Excursion funnels are blue tubes of anti-gravity, which gently transport the player from one end of the map to the other, and they too can be redirected and repositioned with the Portal Gun. Each new item is introduced gently, to let the player become familiar with its capabilities, and then Valve starts ramping up the difficulty.  The puzzle rooms are incredibly well designed in that there's no hard and fast rule with the game's difficulty curve. Once the tutorials are out of the way, it's down to every individual player's desire to break the code on each environment, which allows them to move from the entrance to the exit. Even if one player finds the solution to one particular room obvious, this doesn't mean that everyone else will, and some puzzles may take up to hour to solve. All the while GlaDOS pours scorn over the player's efforts, with a stream of insults that are petty, vindictive and immature – made more hilarious by her robotic, sing-song voice.  The humour in Portal 2 is another trump card in the game's well-paced, engrossing and unsettling story. Without giving too much of the game's plot away, the player will find Portal 2 funny throughout, but also faintly spinechilling. GlaDOS and Wheatly are by turns funny and monstrous and the Aperture Labs take on an increasingly oppressive atmosphere as the player ventures deeper into the facility, learning more about its origins. Meanwhile, the unseen character from the first Portal is still lurking behind the scenes, scrawling paranoid messages and horrific cartoons on the walls.  The game's main campaign is longer than in Portal 1, and arguably better too. Once that's over and done with, however, players can return to Aperture in the multiplayer. This mode is a standalone story starring two cute droids, Atlas and Peabody, who are sent testing by GlaDOS, and the series of puzzles they have to navigate depends on them working successfully as a team. While it may sound strange that a game offering such a successful solitary experience as Portal should include such a mode, it's actually delightful fun. Once again, the puzzles are well-balanced and brilliantly constructed and, GlaDOS has a new collection of insults.  Valve has created a masterpiece in Portal 2. The depth of content, the mind-bending mechanics and fantastic experience are almost certain to satisfy ardent fans of the first game; and to all newcomers to the series, it's as simple as this: prepare to have your mind blown. Over and over again.",

This could be one of the best sequels for a game, I've played, though it really didn't start as a serious project and since bloomed into something that's pretty damn great.   If you're not familiar, this was really just a lone physics game that valve aquired and then turned into Portal. So where to go from a shot game about puzzles with physics? Start with: new puzzles (obviously), also make a well made story with atmosphere and humor the game was originally known for, include a mysterious deeper lore for previous fans, add new ways to solve puzzles, have friends co-op on a seperate part of the game with even more puzzles, then finaly as Cave Johnson would probably add 'Market the crap out of it'.    So i am here to say they did it all, and they did it right. It's hard for me to say anything bad, not even sure there is anything inherently bad about this game. Maybe how mainsteam the game has become? Not really. Lack of puzzels after game? No they fixed that. Maybe the lack of answers from the lore? Hopefully in time it will all be answered.

Co-op mode's great as well, but it has a serious, recurring error, where the game will suddenly disconnect you, and player you're with, for no apparent reason. Workshop mode is tricky at first, as figuring out the controls, and what kinds of test chambers people enjoy, can be frustrating, but once you figure out both of those issues, everything else goes smoothly.

            "review_text": "Not much can be said on my part that hasn't already been expressed by others in ther reviews of Portal 2, but I feel that this game is the definitive adventure game sequel to come from Valve. Yes, I've played Half-Life 2. No, I didn't enjoy that. 1. Gameplay: The core idea that Portal 2 holds is very simple. Shoot two portals, walk through one, you walk out the other. But as you progress through the game it begins to add many layers to this formula which make it into the complex, semi-difficult puzzle adventure it's known as. 2. Story: While this may be somewhat odd to pick up without having played the first game, Portal 2 is definitely accessible to those new to the franchise's short plot line, and certainly welcomes them. The few characters you meet along the way all have very distinct personalities, and just ooze charm with some of their memorable quotes throughout. The main story line (SPOILER ALERT) is a sort of escape story at the start, just trying to find a way out of the clutches of GladOS, but after being betrayed by Wheatley, the story takes a turn for the more complex, giving inciteful backstory on Aperture Science and GladOS herself, makin this somewhat more entertaining for those who played through the first as well. In the end, it's got a good solid story, and the ending is amazing. Also, finding all the Rattman dens is worth your time if you're not planning to rush the game. 3. Control: The physics and controls in this game are some of the tightest I've seen in a 3D puzzle physics game, and that's absolutely necessary, because without pinpoint precision, you're not going to complete the tests, now are you? 4. Audiovisuals: The soundtrack for this game holds a mysterious feel throughout as ou explore the abandoned halls of Old and New Aperture, and although it never truly holds a forefront position in the game's atmosphere except in a few more intense situations, it holds it's own. The graphics are stellar and make for a nice attention to detail. This looks good for a game from 2011. Overall, Portal 2 is one of Valve's most solid titles and is certainly worth your time, more so than Half Life 2. And if you're seekin humor, I will say that without a doubt this game managed to make me chuckle a few times.",

            "review_text": "A good game. Some of its puzzles are capable of giving one a headache, however they are all doable for an averagely intelligent player. Despite the fact that the game is focused on solving physics-based puzzles only, it does not get boring. Almost every new test chamber introduces new elements, which requires the player to try different approaches. A nice feature is the multi-player co-op mode which allows the player to be tested together with a friend. The game looks very well-made and detailed. It is hard to find any bugs in it, which I always like to do out of curiosity. The plot is definitely a bit more complex than in the game's prequel, and it is also often filled with humor, which is another plus. All in all, I believe it is one of the best games made by Valve so far, and I would certainly recommend it to everyone; except obviously children for whom it would be definitely too difficult.",

Portal, and especially Portal 2, is written, designed, and scored with such excellence and ingenuity. Storytelling, drama, humor, and fantastic music, as well as true playability for gamers of all types, are the strengths i see here. i played through Portal 1 twice, and will soon play through Portal 2 a second time, just for the fun of it (and the commentary). i highly recommend this game. Even if you're not a hard core gamer (i'm not), you should play the Portal series. i experienced only moderate frustration on a couple levels/puzzles, but never once had to look for hints or cheats. i also experienced virtually zero bugs or crashes (i can't remember any crashes, though i might have forgotten something due to just totally loving this game).

Value made this series quite unique and fun. I'm going to end the mini chit-chat and go straight into the review and the gameplay.    Before reading this whole thing i would like to say that this game is newbie friendly to players that are new to puzzle games and this is also quite difficult for players that are experts at puzzle games.  So the gameplay of portal 2 is really smooth, fine and crisp. From time to time you might find your self in a loop-hole or stuck in a world of limbo you must get your self out of. The basic puzzle that they give you in the starting of the game is good enough for you to understand the basic concept and feeling. The story is really fantastic and amazing compared to the first portal.    ofc    The character development is so tight bonding till the point you can acutely understand everyone personality. Sorry but there's not that much i can say about the story without spoiling it so yea... A quick fun fact to do you know that the actor   Stephen Merchant   [www.imdb.com]  voice acted the new character in the game name 'Wheatley'. (Hes known from the movie 'Tooth Fairy' with The Rock back in 2010. Also   J.K.Simmons  [www.imdb.com]  Is a voice actor in this game to.

Its bigger but a little unwieldy but its still tons of fun and manges to add some new physics to the mix.  The gameplay its self is pretty much the same. there are some new physic elements that add to the mix and these are handled very well though when you add them to portal use things can get kind of overwhelming, fortuantly they gradually easy you in to how they work just like they did with portals, unfortuantly that means your going to have to go through gradual tutorial style puzzles mulitpule times in the game. Not a deal breaker but it does make the game drag a little between the funny bits.  The humor is still dead on. the writting is great. and i can not stress enough how awsome cave johnson is.  thats really all i can say about it other than it has a co-op campagin now thats actually alot of fun too.

Although it does a poorer job of mixing story with gameplay, both the former and the latter are better than they were in the first game; Portal 2 sports more characters, although our old friend GLaDOS makes a return as a main character and is still the most likable in the game. There's a host of new gameplay mechanics, such as propulsion, repulsion, and conversion gel, all substances that either propel the player into the air, speed up the player's movements, or makes a surface portal-a-ble. This game also provides to us what I consider to be one of the best endings in gaming history, at least for the single player campaign, which leads me to my next point: there's more than one campaign! Portal 2's cooperative campaign thrusts you and another player into the position of Atlas and P-Body, GLaDOS' personal testing androids. You'll solve very complex test chambers with a friend, and it proves to be a true meeting of the minds as you combine your intellect to complete these puzzles and achieve a strong sense of satisfaction afterwards. Aside from this, it is also worth noting that thanks to the Perpetual Testing Initiative, a free map editor fully equipped with workshop support, this game's replay ability is now as infinite as its community's imagination.  TL;DR  Better than the original, definitely worth your money.",

Ran the co-op mode with my close friends few days ago, and finished the single player just yesterday.  Single player: The single player's story is rather entertaining. It's a puzzle game and it keeps up a rather smooth story and keeps away from making the puzzle ridiculously hard so to move on with the story. Commical and thrilling if I were to describe living the moments of Portal 2. Despite not having a partner like in co-op, the characters do a great job in entertaining you and encouraging you through the puzzles. Even the storyline in the single player mode can become a facinating discussion topic with your friends. The rules to the puzzle-solving are really simple. White space, make a portal, go through it. There are the blue, orange, white paint with automated turrets trying to kill you and everything but they easily become part of the game.  Co-op The mascots of Portal 2 (in my opinion), P-body and Atlus, are both very adorable touch to a rather unique co-op puzzle game. It's a very different experience from the single player, which avoids making the gameplay feel plainly repetitive. Lots of fun in 10% of the time trying to actually solve the puzzle while other 90% is dwelling in the temptation of wanting to kill each other. Getting achievements in this silliness adds more laugh to the short 8 hours journey. (Maybe more, depends on how good you are at killing your partner.)  Post Game There are other challenges you can do, or other puzzles available in Steam workshop. You won't end up playing as often as you do the first few hours after beating the game. Is it worth the money? Yes, and even more worth it when it's on sale.  It seems like you can get active in the Portal community, which should be fairly easy to do, and explore more loads of fun Portal 2 has stored within. Just grab some friends to be part of it with you...   I got other games I want to play at the moment, but I feel that I'd definitely come back for more of this. Fantastic puzzle game! Enjoyable!

But, it was extremely short, and I mean EXTREMELY short, and the narrative kind of came full circle by the end. You test, you test, you find out Glados is evil, almost die, kill her, THE END. So really, when the sequel was announced, everyone was excited but still cautious, as no one really knew what it was going to be about. What came out however, is holding a place in my top ten video games of all time, Portal 2 is that good. The story should take over 10 hours, and below 15 hours to complete, smashing Portal 1's 3 hour journey. The length does depend, however, on how good you are at thinking with portals. But every second of this game is awesome. Glados makes a more than welcome return, a new character called Wheatley is introduced, who is hilarious. The voice acting is spectacular, the visuals are crisp and clean, the story is deep and envoking (yes, in a game where you go around shooting portals, the story is deep and envoking) and if that isn't enough, there is an awesome co-op side game you can play with friends, which is actually just as good as the main story. The level designs are awesome, and it is always fun with friends. The thing Portal 2 really succeeds at, however, is making it difficult enough but not making it seem unfair, and not making you want to stop playing. Portal 2 is a brilliant game, and.... Portal 3? Valve? Play Portal 2 if you haven't already.",

The game is full of light-hearted humor, and although it might not be enough to make you laugh out loud, you'll definitely be enjoying the humorous voice-acting as you think to solve the difficult puzzles.  And then there's Co-Op mode. I personally like to call it 'Portal your partner into traps until they ragequit', but that's just me. The Co-Op mode can take a good eight hours or so to complete.  So the base game gives you almost 40 hours worth of enjoyment, and let me tell you that going back and playing the singleplayer campaign isn't even that uncommon, since you can sometimes find things you missed the first time around.  The game also includes a decent map editor with Steam Workshop support, so you will never run out of things to play.",

Ein Juwel von einem Spiel, das finden auch die anderen momentan 134,617 Leute, die Portal 2 empfehlen.  Nicht nur, dass die Idee der Portal-Gun wunderbar frisch und unausgenutzt ist, es spielt sich auch klasse. Die Rätsel sind komplex und bringen die grauen Zellen ordentlich zum Rauchen. Der Coop-Modus motiviert und macht mit einem Freund über Voice Chat extrem viel Spaß! Gesamt kann man etwa 25 Stunden mit dem Spiel verbringen, wenn man Story und Coop-Modus einmal durchspielt. Es gibt mittlerweile aber auch noch einige andere Features, wie etwa den Challenge-Modus, der nochmal für einige Stunden mehr Spielzeit sorgt. Die Geschichte ist schlichtweg genial: GLaDOS sorgt für hunderte lustige Momente, und der Humor trifft genau ins Schwarze. Was nicht heißen soll, dass es schwarzer Humor ist... keineswegs, der Humor ist gleichzeitig speziell als auch für jedermann und ich kenne niemanden, der nicht bei den zahlreichen Sprüchen und Anekdoten von GLaDOS nicht zumindest schmunzeln muss. Auch sonst ist die Geschichte toll, und das Ende toppt an Humor alles, was ich bis her gesehen habe... SPAAAAACE *-* Der traditionelle Song am Ende fand ich zwar gut, aber an den genialen Song aus Portal 1 kam er nicht ran. Sowohl deutsche als auch englische Sprachausgabe sind absolut top.  Was bleibt noch zu erwähnen... KAUFEN!!! :) Egal welche Genres du normalerweise spielst, egal welches Setting du bevorzugst, du wirst Portal 2 und insbesondere GLaDOS mögen, lieben und hassen lernen. ;)  **********  Portal 2... nothing more to say.  A wonderful game, that's not only what I'm thinking, but also the other 134,617 people, who recommend Portal 2 at the moment. Not only the idea of the Portal-Gun is new and unexploited, but also the gameplay is excellent. The puzzles are very complex - especially later on in the game - and your brain will have a hard time solving them. The Coop-mode is motivating and extremely fun when played with a friend using voice chat, teamspeak or skype. The game takes around 25 hours of your time when you want to finish the campaign and the Coop-mode. Nowadays there are also some more features like the mod-suport or the challenge-mode, which make you spend even more time in the game. The story is simply brilliant: GLaDOS makes you laugh nearly every second and the humor is again very cool. It's both humor for everyone but also black humor sometimes. I know nobody who doesn't at least smile while playing Portal 2. And then there's the ending. Phenomenal! It's so much fun... SPAAAAACE *-* The ending song is pretty good again, but I liked the one from Portal 1 a bit more. Since English is not my mother tongue I played the game in both German and English. Both are pretty good voice acted.  Nothing more to say except, BUY IT!!! :) No matter what genre you prefere, you'll get to know, love and hate the game and especially GLaDOS. ;)",

I honestly don’t know what grabbed me, but as soon as I blinked, I was addicted.   Now, I hear all the negativity that can come with saying that one thinks Portal 2 is better than Portal, but honestly, if I’d played Portal first, I wouldn’t have bought as much merchandise as I have sitting in my house right now.

What can I say about it, its a semi challenging first person plattformer with a touch of puzzles. And it has very good writing, very funny characters which kind of saves this game from being incredebly dull sometimes.  The one thing I did not like is the same thing I don't like with all of valves games, it has a very very VERY dull art style but it's still pretty and colourfull sometimes. But there are points where everything looks the same and you start to feel like no progression is made. Thank god for Wheatly he alone makes the start of the game good and Glados makes the run towards the end good, but when I'm in mid game I get very bored because of the lack of colours and funny characters.  IN SHORT: This game is good, it's the best game from valve, not one of the greatest games ever but one that's worthy of your time.",

The characters are all funny and likable (even the evil ones) and although you only meet four people face to face (counting the co-op bots at the end) you learn the story of others through audio and rats nests. The puzzles are very well thought out and take time and thought to complete, and even then you almost never know all the solutions.   The co-op is at best frustrating. While a good concept, I felt that unless you are playing with a friend it's almost impossible. And even then it's very frustrating trying to get them to think like you. As self centered as that sounds, it's true; this game requires both players to think as one, and most friends don't.   All in all it's a good game. Fingers crossed for Portal 3.

Now, Portal 2 has built on it and has added more of the fun from Portal. The sense of humor is not as sardonic and dark as the first one but still pretty funny. The game itself is a bit dull at points but the physics engine is beyond amazing and the scenery is really crisp and engaging especially on my HD monitor. The game doesn't add too much new to the core mechanics which is a good thing because they have no need for a change. The story drags a bit but overall the few criticisms I have for it are far outweighed by the fact that it is still one of the few games I will play over and over again, once I beat it. Above all, play the first one before you even touch the second, the story will make much more sense and you will find better humor and tighter gameplay there. But again, I highly recommend Portal 2, it just has the unfortunate position of being the sequel to what has to be my favorite game of all time so, I still score it 94/100.",

There is actually a decent story through the single player mode. With much of the same game concepts they still add some different puzzles and traps along the way.  The difficulty was increased for the testing. Plenty of times I had to just sit and think of how the hell I the test was possible. I will admit I had to look up some sort of walk through for 2 tests. I was getting so annoyed my computer desk was at risk of being ripped in half. Waiting for a friend to purchase the game so we can try out the Co-Op story together. Overall the game is great and they did a magical job on the sequel to Portal.

The gameplay is superb, relying on completely unique components such as momentum-preserving portals, gels with different properties, and lasers-- among other things.

Portal 2 improves on Portal in many ways, from adding new game mechanics to a deeper story with more charcters. You find yourself in an Aperture Science Relaxiation Vault, a little room resembeling a hotel room. As you wake up, you are told to do a series of simple tasks, and go back to sleep. The next time you wake up, Aperture Science is in ruins. It has been a very long time since you woke last, and you are waken by a little robot core named Wheatly. Aperture Science is about to explode, and Wheatly helps you work through to get out. You go though a series of tests, midway though you get the Aperture Science Hand Held Portal Device, which helps you solve the tests. You meet up with Wheatly, and go to GLaDOS's chainber, the robot in charge of the facility, and is now turned off. You accendatly turn her on, and she gives you the Aperture Science Hand Held Dual Portal Device, or the Portal Gun, which allows you to shoot two portals instead of one. You now go though a series of tests guided by her, and when you make it to her chainber, you defeat her by replacing her with Wheatly. But, when you give this power to Wheatly, he turns evil and traps you into a pit. You fall down a hole into Old Aperture, which was used in the 50's though 80's. You make your way through the test chainberes guided not by GLaDOS, but by Cave Johnson, the then CEO of Aperture Science. You make your way up into Wheatly's lair, where you defeat him. This game is Amazing, but you'll get the full experiance if you play Portal first, then move on to Portal 2.",

Even when they aren´t talking about something important. The riddles are pretty cool, espacially because of the portal gun. They sometimes take a while to figure out, but they are never too hard. Often, you just facepalm yourself because you thougt 10 minutes about a way out and then suddenly realise how easy it is to get out of this place.

Well in portal 2 you are still playing as the original character chell and was in a room where you would be picked for later testing. But a robot came alon named wheatley who comes along and helps you out and you come across GLaDOS turned. but of course wheatley does something stupid and you have to fight her again going through 19 puzzles. And when you defeat her wheatley is now in charge and GLaDOS's intelligence is now in a potatoe which you carry around with you because wheatley through you two down a hole. And as you travel through the underground you come across the first testing chambers and find a story that you will have to find out for yourself. But in these testing chambers your using gel. The blue allows you to jump higher, the orange to move faster and the white allows you to create portals where it has touched.

The puzzles get harder to solve as you go along, and at some point, you may not even be able to solve it yourself! Grab a buddy and go through these puzzles (if you dont have a buddy, Wikipedia is there...). Its mysterious background fits well for this, and why (as well as fits in another VALVe title...). The Portal franchise itself is fantastic and I still think it has the best storyline of any game ever! I first played this game in 2011, and I've played many Triple A (AAA) titles. This game, right here, can single-handedly change your view on many good game stories, concepts, and maybe even (if you don't like shooter games) change your opinion on disliking some other games.

Portal 2, on the other hand, is the exact opposite: Not much more is added that hasn't been seen in games before, but you're playing for the plot this time, which despite being quite basic manages to be gripping. The dialogue is flawless, with the voice actors perfectly cast, and the humour is spot on, with the dark humour of the original provided in spades.  That being said, some of the challenge of the original game is sadly missing, with much of the   Old Aperture   tests being bland, with a large number simply being a case of finding the patch of slightly less grey wall and then deciding whether you need to spray gel on it or stand on it. The novelty of these gels wears off rather quickly, trampolines and patches which make you run faster didn't exactly make their debut here, and so you spend much of the   Old Aperture   section waiting for it to end.  However, it's well worth it when it does.   Wheatley's   chambers are possibly the best in the game, and the boss fight is a massive improvement on the slightly repetitive GlaDOS fight of the original, with not one element of it unmemorable. Well worth replaying as well, there's actually more dialogue for that scene than there is  time , so it's worth earning a few game overs.  Long story short, great game and an improvement over the original, however not worth playing if you plan to play with sound off or didn't like the original.",

The sheer amount of creativness in this game is sick. Some puzzles is very simple, otheers complicated. -Amazing voice actors. Freaking Jk.Simmons voices a character! -More than one soloution to puzzles. (In most of them) -It is longer than the first one. -Mods so the game can always be played. -Amazing story. It is a very fun, and well written story, this game has.  -A good concept. -Portal two is the of the thre games where i have watched, the outro. -Reasonable price  CONS: -I am really bad at puzzle games, so this weren´t a problem for me, but the game might be a tad short, if you are a skilled puzzle game player. -Sometimes i think that it is a bit tedious when you stop doing the test chambers, and come out in these big massive rooms. -Long ♥♥♥ loading sceens and a lot of them  Overall Portal 2 gets a 9.5 for me. I would recommend this game to EVERYONE EVER. It is without a doubt, on my top 3 games of all time list.",

The puzzles were challenging and fun to do. I also have to mention that they did a great job on balancing the puzzles and the story so it doesn't get repetitive.   Also there is a coop mode where you and your partner play with a different portal device, making the puzzles even more challenging. There is a handy pinging option, and a ping that counts down for when you have to do the same action simultaneously. This makes it very easy to tell your partner what to do.  Even if you have completed the entire story, and completed all maps in coop mode, you can still play or even make player made maps. These can also be solo or cooperative. Therefor there are plenty of maps to play after the story.  If you're not into common games (like shooters, MMO's etc.), then you should defenitely get Portal and/or Portal 2.",

Also, I love how now the Portal community is able to create test chambers and share their creations with the community, even though there can be a corrupted autosave glitch. Before you move on to a different game, you must check out the co-op Portal 2 campaign. It delivers a new, more challenging experience to the game that you can share with a friend (or a random person online), as long as you don't be a jerk to your partner. Overall, I recommend this game for everyone who enjoys playing a game that makes them think, or to people in it for the commedy, or the story (I recommend playing the first Portal to catch up on the story) for it is a truly unique game that offers a different FPS experience compared to other run and gun FPS.

They start good, then they get better when they introduce gels and bridges, but sometimes you will find rooms that you have to be doing something PERFECTLY good or the answer isn´t as obvious as you think. I will admit, I noclipped some rooms of the last 2 stages because some of the puzzles were ridiculous and frustrating, and to be honest, they seem rushed. I really wonder what happened, in the other chapters the puzzles were great and had excellent difficulty, but damn, those last 2 chapters, along with the entirety of old Aperture are frustrating (The last 2 chapters more than old Aperture).  Also, I hate how there´s a loading screen for every single room. It really does ruin the flow and pacing of the game.  As I said, Co-Op is fun as hell. Grab a buddy, play locally, and one moment you´ll be celebrating, while other times you will want to kill eachother, it´s great.  And the fact that there´s a LOT of post-content made by users after completing the game (and there are people still doing levels!) is amazing.

In this game, you have Wheatley, GLaDOS always taunting you, making her way more personal than in the first game so you actually have a connection, her hate towards you, Cave Johnson's recordings, and then GLaDOS again as an actual companion. It doesn't make this game bad, but it's a lot different than what I excpected of a Portal game. It's probably just nostalgia.  I can't honestly call this a classic, but I can say that it will be.

Really starts off with a bang in this department. The artists did very well adding little details everywhere you go. Many awe inspring moments throughout the game.  Sound: This game really shines in this department! The music fits the mood and environments incredibly well. The sound effects are iconic. The voice acting is superb.  Story: Great from beginning to end. Delves deep into the history of Aperture Science but leaves some room for mystery and intrigue. The protagonist doesn't speak but the writing for the other characters is so phenomenal it makes up for it. Wheatley and GLaDOS are two of the best characters in gaming.  Bottom-line: A Masterpiece!

            "review_text": "Portal 2 is definitely a must buy. It is one of those games that hooks you in from the start until the very end and leaves that feeling of 'i want some more' when you're done with it.  STORY The story takes place after Portal 1 and is told pretty much alike: dubious, obscure, interpretative. You're constantly being manipulated by the characters in this game, and the few truths are to be found or concluded by yourself and/or outside of the test chambers, where you get to visit Aperture's offices and learn about it's creations and origins. Personally i love these kinds of storytelling because it opens so much space for discussion and secrets that it makes the game even more entertaining.  GAMEPLAY It's basically a puzzle game that consists into figuring out the portals physics and how to interact with the enviroment around you and with other gizmos such as turrets, crates, the infamous Companion Cube, gels and so on.Some of them are quite hard and challenging. It's a better version of Portal on this aspect, and if you have played it and liked it, you're bound to enjoy Portal 2's gameplay as well.  CHARACTERS I felt that creating this topic was important because the main antagonists in this game are AMAZING. Ellen McLain did and astonishing job on voicing GLaDOS. She annoys you, manipulates you, makes you angry, is ironic and has one of the smartest dialogue to be seen in videogame history. Definitely my personal favorite villain. And there's also Wheatley, a british-ish robot core that (SPOILER!) starts as a friendly guy but betrays you halfway through the game, so you end up seeing both of his personalities, even though he never ceases to be a moron and never ceases his stand-up-like jokes, which in my opinion makes him quite interesting, funny and enjoyable.  MULTIPLAYER The multiplayer coop campaign is a great experience that adds to the replay value of this game. It's just as good as the main campaign, except that it requires two thinking brains and Portal guns. It even brighten up a little bit this game's story, so it's pretty interesting, and it's quite long too.  Overall, this game is a masterpiece. If you do not own it yet, i truly recommend it.   BTW: Someone please teach Mr. Gabe Newell and the Valve team how to count to 3. They might be lacking some basic math here and pretty much the entire community would like a third installment to most of their games, such as Portal, Half-life and Left4Dead. Let's make number 3 a reality.",

The first one were good but often the second game turns out worse, which doesn't seem to be happening at Valve. This is a great game! Really loved it! Right now i have already played the game twice and. The reason i decided to replay this fantastic game is probably not because of the 'game' itself, even tough the gameplay certainly had replayability, but the one reason i decided to do another playthrough is the voiceacting, especially Wheatley's. Stephen Merchant did such a good job as the sidekick for the player and everybody grew to love him. I never get tired of hearing his jokes during the game I would easily give it a 10/10  pros: Great game overall. Great story( Yes puzzle games can have good stories too). Great level design. Great puzzle's (obviously) And last but but least, great voice acting that made this game into a 'one in a lifetime' experience.  cons: i can litteraly only come up with ONE thing about the game that wasn't perfect, and the 'problem' were in the level design. In some parts of the game, like chapter 6-9 if i remember correctly. the levels were really open, that's all i'm gonna say to keep it spoiler free. (if you played the game you know what i mean). The 'problem' there, maybe it was just me but sometimes i found it really hard to know where you were supposed to go. My first playthrough i spent like 30 minutes trying to get a door open only to relaise that the door were a part of a puzzle i had already completed. Similar things happened more than a few times to me but i wouldn't call it a 'problem'. Overall it was a great game and it is totally worth every single euro (even tough i picked it up on sale).

Portal is a great game, with some frustrating parts. Portal 2 follows that same level of difficulty, but change GREAT, to AMAZING. First of all, our villain(s) are great. The voice acting is great once again, as are the characters. True, it is just the cores, Glados, Wheatly, and Cave Johnson and Carolin, but all of them with the exception of Carolin which I'll get to later are all geat. The game follows the same rutine that you did last time. Except the game visually looks MUCH BETTER. You can see this in the ruins of the old testing chambers and the ending cut scene. Now do you remember in the last game where you run from Glados, only to reach Glados? Well, in this game you do the same thing, until you reach Glados, who reawakens at the beginning of the game. You see, you've been traveling with Wheatly this whole time. A lovable robot with a great voice and personality. You then get to Glados, and replace her from full control to Wheatly. At the time, you think it's a great idea, until Wheatly does his laugh. He then promptly throws you and Glados out of the facility, giving you 18+ more stages to play! And while Glados scolds you for being stupid, you feel like it's your fault, and it is! But now the game is flipped. Wheatly and Glados have swapped, and she has become, A POTATO BATTERY. Well then. You then go through all these levels, where new mechanics are introduced. And durring these levels, you not only find out more about Apature curtesy of Cave Johnson's voice, you also find out that Glados is Carolin! You then finally make it back to Wheatly, and then have to endure a similar fight to the last game! BUT IN REVERSE. See with last time, you had to knock cores off of a defenseless Glados with rockets, slowly currupting herself, making her explode. Now here, you want to put cores onto Wheatly. Now you may actually want to listen to these cores for once, as they are hilarious. Namely Space Core. Now here, you do the same thing, but Wheatly defends himself! Anyway, the game 'ends' with Wheatly being sent to the moon, Glados being back in control, and Chel being sent away out of Apature. Now with online mode, or Co-op, you go through hard levels. Now, your experience is best with friends or having a mic, because believe me, people do troll here. And lastly, the level creator. I'm a fan of this in concept, but my computer just doesn't agree with the controls. If you can get more out of this mode, well more power to you. Overall, I think that Portal 2 is an amazing game.",

They're much longer than they were in the first Portal, and a thirty-second respawn time is extremely frustrating in a game where you have to rely on trial and error. And the puzzles can be frustratingly hard, but hey, that's how puzzle games are supposed to be.  But other than that, Portal 2 is great. Gameplay? Equal parts thrilling and cerebral. Comedy?

I grew up with this game and I was in love with it the first time I saw its crystal clear graphics and heard its lovely character voicing... this game is awesome. Great graphics, great audio, great storyline, great mechanics, great test chamber creater, great merch, great community, great music, everything about this game is awesome. I cannot stress how worthy of twenty bucks this game is, and with the new sale it's only four dollars. Try Portal or Portal 2 out. For four bucks you have nothing to lose! So do yourself a favor and play this game.  There are only about two bad things in this game. 1: The puzzles start to get slightly hard and you might rage... (like, a lot) and 2: sometimes the puzzles are a bit unclear with what you have to do exactly... but overall this is still a great game.  If you are looking for a first-person shooter that has tons of combat and circles around war, this is not the game for you. But if you are looking for a funny, quirky, unique, and interesting puzzle game then this is definitely for you. 9/10 stars!",

In a medium bowl, mix graham cracker crumbs with melted butter. Press onto bottom of springform pan.  In a large bowl, mix cream cheese with sugar until smooth. Blend in milk, and then mix in the eggs one at a time, mixing just enough to incorporate. Mix in sour cream, vanilla and flour until smooth. Pour filling into prepared crust.  Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour. Turn the oven off, and let cake cool in oven with the door closed for 5 to 6 hours; this prevents cracking. Chill in refrigerator until serving.  The whole 'The Cake is a Lie' thing is from the 1st portal, but whatever, this game doesn't have cake either. Buy the game, eat this cake, its worth it.",

            "review_text": "I'll admit, I'm not one to write positive reviews. It is far easier to rant about something you hate rather than give out glowing praise. The other reason it that I'm not too great at it. However, I abandoned all those foolish notions and am currently tapping my review to the rhythmic sounds of 'Want you gone', humming quietly to myself in my basement, with all the lights off save my computer, in my Wheatley Laboratories hoodie, a turret at my left and my mousepad at my right, not having slept for a longer time than I would care to admit, nearly done with playthrough god-knows-what, five and a half years after this game's release while I listen to the sounds of people telling me Portal is dead slowly fade into the background as I turn up my music. I literally cannot give a higher recommendation. This is my favorite game of all time.  The sheer fact that a main story as short as Portal 2's could manage to give me not only so much playtime, but also the willingness to spend 4 times the game's cost worth of money on merchandise, It really shows just how amazing a game can be. I'm not one to spend money on a whim, either. But this is all besides the point.   The story is very short, and if there is a drawback, and it has some pacing issues once you know what to do in all the puzzles (that's hardly fair though). I haven't even looked into speedrunning techniques but I can finish the normally 8-12 hour campaign in around two hours simply taking the most direct routes and knowing exactly where to go and what to do when you get there. However while the story itself it relatively short, believe me, it makes up for it in sheer quality. It doesn't have any moving political commentary or complex morals (or any at all, really) and the plot at it's base definitely isn't anything new, but if you're looking at buying this game and somehow have not heard about the beautifully clever and witty dialogue gracing the three or four characters, oh man, you are in for a treat. The best of them by far is Wheatley, with practically every line he says being something you can laugh at (I have an entire folder with about 30 pages of drawings of just him saying some of his more quoteable lines), but every character has their time to shine. GLaDOS has a lot of good stuff in the latter half of the game and I've straight up seen Cave Johnson's 'Do you know who I am?! I'm the man whose gonna BURN YOUR HOUSE DOWN! With the LEMONS!' on t-shirts. The writers over at Valve are a seriously gifted bunch, I must say. Portal's dialogue was great, but it does not in any way compare to it's younger brother. Portal 2's plot is actually surprisingly dark once you begin looking deeper into it, especially if you've played the game as much as I have. Spoilers ahead obviously, but you watch Cave Johnson go from a slightly reckless happy scientist to slowly losing finantial support from the government, losing test subjects and employees and finally poisoning himself accidentally with moon rocks, where you hear his dying wishes to put Caroline in charge (who is actually part of GLaDOS now) followed by a 'Good-bye, sir.' from the Caroline in GLaDOS that honestly gets me everytime. Looking into more of Aperture's backstory and revealing how nearly everyone was killed by a rogue GlaDOS, aside from one man who is half going insane and ended up being the one that saved Chell from the fate that claimed all of the other 10-15,000 test subjects holed up in Aperture's relaxation center at the cost of his own life and it ends up weaving this fantastic story where the darkness of what really happened to these characters is hidden within lighthearted and hilarious dialogue that makes the darkness interesting, but never overwhelming. Anything potentially ominious goes with something you can laugh at (see anytime anyone makes a death threat, ESPECIALLY Wheatley) so you never feel weighed down by some of the gravity of the deeper story. I honestly cannot praise it enough. It is something to behold.  Gameplay wise I can't say anything that won't be repeating someone else, but puzzles are highly inventive, never too convoluted or frusterating and all enjoyable and even on your first go, and figuring the game out is very satisfying, even if the level isn't too terribly hard. It has become the game I play to relax, and I love it like a son because of that. The only real issue is far too many of the puzzles are dependent on falling somewhere to launch yourself somewhere else, but to be fair that is a pretty efficient way of getting places sooo... I don't know. I will say though while that is prevelant, it is used in plenty of different ways, so it feels fresh each time it appears.  This was honestly the best 20 bucks I've ever spent, even if it was far, far after the hype had gone. I'd like to say, if the fact this is an older game discourages you from buying, don't let it. I have gotten far more enjoyment out of this than most things I've had in my life, and despite the fact I jumped on a bandwagon that had been abandoned at the side of the road long ago, I don't regret a thing. The dialogue still makes me laugh and the characters are seriously top notch, and I haven't tired of it this far through. That has to be a mark of quality of some sort.",

And u can even troll your friend by pulling out his body,which is really funny. When I bought it in 2012 I couldnt resist to not play it and even now 4 years later I play with the game(not that much but i still play it) I dont know if Portal 3 will ever come but I will definitelly buy it as soon as possible  Should you buy the game now? Sure,why not. I know that it came out in 2011 but it is still a really good and funny game to play and if you haven't tried it yet you should give it a try.  P.S.

Significantly longer than the first game, with a much more in-depth story and a couple more incredible characters, Portal 2 was exceptional. Don't know why I took so long to review it, but here I am. The co-op mode is incredibly fun, obviously the story isn't as invested as the single player mode.  It's a bit frustrating if you're trying to play with someone that isn't particularly co-operative, which is counterintuitive, I know. But the gestures help if you're playing without a mic. I love the options to create maps, though I haven't made many myself, all the ones on my account were made by my brother. Amazing game, amazing story, great graphics, enjoyable music. All in all, I'd definitely give this game a 10/10, looking forward to playing through it again sometime soon.",

The puzzles, oh the puzzles...they're difficult at times but not so difficult that they're boring! This is proven by the fact that the 11 year old me enjoyed playing this game until the end. Some puzzle games have overly easy, repetetive and boring puzzles or puzzles that are just university level of physics and math. You have none of that here! Entertaining, unique, and not overly complicated. That is if you don't go into the community levels...  Talking about community made levels...it was a brilliant idea to introduce the level making in game! And the level maker is easy to understand aswell! You just need a little bit of imagination and a brain to make a level! And if you're skilled, you can literally make a horror game inside a puzzle game! Yes there are levels that are horror levels. That is how much you can mess around with this game, as long as you have the brain for that.  And the price? The price, for such an awesome game, is like giving god a piece of dirt to bring back Jesus and he does it.

While the first test chambers are easy to medium, the rest of the game isn't hard, but will sure make you search for the walkthrough on youtube.  The game can be finished legit in 3 hours, but most people do it in ~6 hours, if you dont hunt for easter eggs and references on how Apereture Science violated OSHA countless times.  In my opinion, this game is worth 100% buying, it has a great lore, even better soundtrack and very cool mechanics. ",
