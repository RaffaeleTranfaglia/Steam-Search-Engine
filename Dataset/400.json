            "review_text": "'The cake is a lie!'  It is, but Portal does not lie as it truly is a good game! While short, its puzzles make it an interesting game so much so that you'd immediately want to do a 2nd walkthrough. Also, there is a way to replay several of the so-called 'chambers' but in a more difficult version.  I'm not sure if this has mods like its sequel - nevertheless, it's worth completing this one before moving on to the next as the puzzles are even more difficult and diverse in Portal 2.  I like how the game has a background story while it would not be necessary, at all. It has an excellent antagonist in the form of an A.I. called GLaDOS.  Portal is a memorable experience and if you liked Half-Life you should pick up this Valve product, as well.  Oh, you didn't like Half-Life? Then, please go and have a cake. :)  PS: I'm not sure why I have zero hours logged for this game. Probably because the logging system was introduced after I completed Portal. In any case, my review is based on a gameplay time of roughly 15-20 hours.",

            "review_text": "Life was meaningless.  I had no purpose other than to continue my work, the only thing I had ever known. Work had been fun at first, and my boss had seemed nice and rather witty. However after some time, my boss began acting strange. It started with the lying. Then, my boss began to intentionally make my work dangerous. I survived, but only through quick thinking and a bit of luck.  Eventually the everyday grind of navigating my way through a neverending maze lost any appeal. My boss promised me cake when the job was completely done, but it wasn't worth it. I wished for something, anything, even death, that would rid me from this meaningless existence. I was tempted several times to walk infront of a turret or fall into the radioactive slime, but the pain these methods would bring seemed greater than the pain of a meaningless life, so I carried on.  Then one day, my boss had a surprise for me. He had brought me a Companion to assist me in my work. Or more specifically, an Aperature Science Weighted Companion Cube. At first, the Companion Cube assisted me with basic tasks which I nonetheless couldn't have done without it. We rounded a corner and came face to face with a ball of radioactive energy coming straight towards us.  I thought we were doomed, but then the Companion Cube jumped in front of me of its own accord and shielded me from certain death. My mouth dropped, as I imagined the pain the Cube must have been experiencing. My boss said something about 'symptoms of enrichment center testing' and 'perceiving inanimate objects as alive' but I paid no attention. I knew this was love. I knew this was real.  We continued on together for a while. The Cube was essential in completeing the task my boss had set for me. I tried talking to it, but I received no response. My boss then oddly informed me that the Companion Cube would never threaten to stab me (as if it would ever)...but more importantly he informed me that my Cube was mute. I felt a pang of sadness - not the selfish sadness one feels when they lose something, but the true sadness that is felt when empathizing with another being.  This revelation did not hamper my love for my Cube, my Companion, who had brought happiness and joy into my life, and who had selflessly endured pain to save me from death. After opening the final door which would lead to the elevator I had grown quite familiar with, our boss seemed to congratulate us on our new found compaionship. But then the bos said something which would change my life forever.  'However, [the Companion Cube] cannot accompany you for the rest of the test and, unfortunately, must be euthanized. Please escort your Companion Cube to the Aperture Science Emergency Intelligence Incinerator.'  I gasped in horror, looking across the room and seeing what I now realized must be the Incinerator. I fell to my knees, tears already streaming down my cheeks. I looked at my faithful Companion and proceeded to envelop it in my arms, determined to never let it go.  My boss continued on as if nothing was wrong. 'While it has been a faithful companion, your Companion Cube cannot accompany you through the rest of the test. If it could talk - and the Enrichment Center takes this opportunity to remind you that it cannot - it would tell you to go on without it because it would rather die in a fire than become a burden to you.'  'You could never be a burden to me!' I cried, and hugged my Companion Cube to my chest. But then I remembered. Although my boss had lied to be at one time, boss had since promised that he could no longer lie to me. I had to finish the testing, or else I would never get the Cake. And if the Cube couldn't come with me...didn't want to come with me...  I hugged it one last time then picked myself up off the floor. I walked slowly, hesitantly, toward the button that would open the incinerator. It took more willpower than I've ever needed to press it. Then I picked up my Companion and held it over the flames. Tears clouded my vision and my hands began to sweat uncontrollably, and not just from the heat. I held it there for what seemed like hours, just crying and admiring its beauty. But then I remember the Cake. And the Cube slipped from my hands.  'You euthanized your faithful Companion Cube more quickly than any test subject on record,' said my boss. 'Congratulations.'  11/10 would euthanize my Companion at the behest of my boss and all for a piece of cake again.",

            "review_text": "Portal is a first person puzzle series made by valve themselfs. So before we jump into this review we must praise our lord and savoir Gabe Newell.  There are many more good points than I expected there to be for an 7 year old game. The graphics are very good seeing as the age of the game, you could say it's graphically better than some current ones, no offense to developpers who don't focus on the graphical aspect. You get guided along the way with a robot voice called Glados and I must say she has more humor than the most game characters. For example she says 'Your test is almost over and after you'll be baked and then there will be cake.' The humour itself in this game was also very good, the boss level was very entertaining thanks to all the jokes it had and also the ending was pretty ironic because you'll be the one eating the cake. The ending song was actually amazing, I'm going to download it some time after writing this review. You can solve the puzzles using companion cubes or normal cubes and using your portal gun. The portal gun has two portals a blue one and an orange one and when you pass through one of them you come out of the other one. The controls are not that hard to understand, I barely changed any to my likings. The puzzles get harder each level but there are many useful checkpoints so it makes it not as bad when you die or get stuck.  There are a few minor things about this gem but this are just me noticing details while playing along. You can apparantly save when you are dead or about to respawn rather which is not that useful but I accidentally did that when playing. I was dying from drowning in a puzzle and I saved because I wanted to get back another day and it set my checkpoint to that death so it kept respawning me there. I sometime was doubting if I could portal on some wall or floors. There are three colors in this game, walls or floors rather said, those are black, beige and white. But since beige looks a lot like white you weren't sure if you could portal on it.   I'm doubting still why you are taking time reading this, still thankful though, and not buying this game. Even at full price at this moment it isn't a waste of money and don't mind the gametime as there are many bonusmaps and such which I didn't dig into (yet).",

            "review_text": "After completing the game over four times, and doing the majority of things in Portal, I think I’m ready to review the game. So, Portal is a puzzle-platform game, developed by Valve, and as you cleverly-observed from the title ‘Portal’ there are… Portals, to help you pass each test chamber (best synopsis ever). Thus, I shall just jump straight into the review, which has been split into ‘different sections’ before giving my overall score and final opinions.    Story   –  The game has quite a simplistic story – the protagonist (Chell) has to navigate through a total of nineteen test-chambers with her Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device, or simply the ‘portal gun’. She is essentially a lab-rat for GLaDOS, who is an artificial intelligence that would guide and monitor the player. I won’t say any more than that, as it does get quite interesting by the end of the game. When I played through the game for the first time, it took me about three to four hours to complete with that time getting shorter and shorter as I knew how to get through each level, but there was never a point where I felt I paid far too much for the game, and I felt that the game’s length suited the value.     Gameplay   –  Obviously, throughout this game you use portals. At the start, you can shoot blue portals before obtaining the ability to shoot orange portals as well. This concept was clearly reused by the game ‘Narbacular Drop’; I believe the people who made that game also joined Valve in making Portal. This idea was interesting enough on its own, for a short game, but they added a few more mechanics such as the Weighted Companion Cube coming into play, or the usage of speed benefitting you in quite a few puzzles. And I liked how Portal applies physics to each of its puzzles, thus making each solution seem more logical (well as logical as portals existing anyway). Of course, it’s nowhere near as in-depth as a handful of gameplay mechanics that has been introduced in the game’s sequel – Portal 2, yet because of the game’s length and style, it holds on its own and I never felt bored by the simple gameplay.     Replayability   –  After completing the game, there are further options to lengthen your gameplay-time such as attempting the Advanced Maps, which are quite challenging and they are pretty much just harder versions of existing maps you’ve already done in the original game. There’s also Portal Challenges which involves you trying to beat a puzzle with the least amount of portals, least amount of steps or the fastest time possible (however as of yet, I haven’t tried this option). But aside of trying to claim achievements, finding Easter eggs, finding different ways to do the same puzzle or attempting speed-runs of the game (I managed to complete the game at around 2.1 hours on my last attempt), there is very little reason to actually run through the game beyond a second, or even third time. Yet, even then, I still feel like this game is worth your money and your play-time may reach five-seven hours, if you disregard achievement-hunting or other activities within the game.    Overall   –   This is a relatively shorter review, than to my first one, which suits the relatively shorter game (despite twenty hours of playtime) but honestly, this game must be acknowledged for its gameplay, its humour as well as its difficulty – as I have to say that the last four to six test-chambers do a good job of challenging you initially and there were fond moments, where I stopped and thought “Oh!!! That’s how you… …damn.”, after wasting length proportion dying and head-scratching. I can honestly say that this game was a memorable experience for me, when I first bought it a couple of months ago, and it is as fun and enjoyable as it is now, with me now having fond memories of many different sections within this game. I must recommend this game to all, as this is a great game with many great qualities and almost no flaws aside of length (which is not even a major problem for me). Therefore, I’m giving the game an   8/10   and I would highly recommend people to buy it whether you are ok with the price, or whether you wish to buy the Portal Bundle on sale (Portal 1 + 2) for a relatively cheap price, it’s up to you. Thanks for reading my review!    My Scoreboard   –  1/10 ---&gt; 4/10 – Not worth it.  5/10 ---&gt; 6/10 – Below Average/Mediocre.  7/10 – Above Average.    8/10 – Great.    9/10 ---&gt; 10/10 – Outstanding + Must Own.",

In fact if I think about the hours I spent playing this I can feel I actually had fun. The puzzles were not too hard, but the sense of wonder about how portals work was cool and I enjoyed that.   Too bad sometimes I had to fight the game itself (crates falling, setting portals were I wanted to, jumping). The other big issue was I got motion sickness eventually.   The last level was very cool (and way longer than I thougt) but the 'boss fight' was not excpetional (again expetations vs reality).

It allowed for a new type of game puzzle - one based purely on mundane real-world puzzle solving.

But the puzzles alone aren't what make Portal great. The pacing is perfect. The humor is dry and laugh-out-loud funny (tip: turn on the captions). But Portal's crowning achievement is its ability to make a player feel like a genius when he or she figures out the puzzles. The 'a ha' moments are a pure endorphine tidal wave.

All in all a fantastic idea coupled with a fantastic story line.. Making for a fantastic game  My rating: Length:8/10 Gameplay:10/10 All round enjoyment:10/10 ",

Levels are designed in a way that you have to think where to shoot the portals and get harder as the game progresses on. Further on, you will have to deal with turrets and think of clever ways to do that. Portals cannot be created on certain surfaces.   Portal's level design is brilliant and players will have to use the environment to their advantage. Story is also pretty good, and there is more of it in the second game. Last thing, there is cake.

The puzzles aren't the hardest things in the world, and are also often based off of momentum, or to describe it simply,  'speedy thing goes in, speedy thing comes out.'  Though, the difficulty of the puzzles doesn't mean you won't die. Some puzzles will cause your death on the first try, but when you finally reach the moment when your mind figures out how to do this certain puzzle, the feeling is simply awesome. There are slight tricks that the robotic AI, GLaDOS says/does, one example is the promise of cake. She says  'You will be baked, and there will be cake' , which basically means that she will   attempt to kill you with fire.   Those tricks are nice and will cause you to listen to that part again to see if you heard it incorrectly or not.   Ultimately, this is quite an exceptional game.  Short version:  Nice gameplay. Good graphics. Awesome sensations, and neat twists. It's a tad bit short, bit is exceptionally grand.",

The gameplay is also really neat. As far as I can tell, Portal fits most neatly into the genre of 'first-person action-adventure puzzle-platformer shooter'. In other words, it really doesn't match any established genre of game around; and that alone is enough to give you bragging rights among gamers! (Well, it would have been enough in 2007, anyway. Now you're just late to the party, but as they say, better late than never.)  While it is definitely a short game, it's only $10 - seriously, you can't go wrong with it. Give it, oh, half an hour, and you'll be hooked. You'll probably buy Portal 2, too (there's a lot more to that one). Yes, there will be parts that you get stuck on (unless you watch a walkthrough). Just sleep on it. Trust me, in the morning you'll kick yourself and say 'How did I miss that?' All you have to do is think with portals.

The use of the Portal Gun is incredibly well tought and won't let you get off your computer. The only downside, is that this game is extremely short. I've finished the main story in 3 hours which is pretty not that much. At least, the advanced test chambers, the challenges and the achievements can add more playtime.

Also, the 'Transmission Recieved' achievement makes it more challenging for the overachievers. I have most of the radios, but I still have a headache or two to defeat still. The advanced test chambers demand better planning, timing, and nerve, and are relatively challenging... until you beat the first couple of levels. From there on, it gets easy until level 18, which puzzled me for a while on the first time playing through on the NORMAL version. The game is not very long. I wish it was longer. It needs to introduce the turrets earlier, if you ask me. If not, it needs to have more turrets and it needs to make removing them more challenging. Even the upgraded version of the turret seems almost harmless if you have a good rame rate. Even the final boss fight was simple and easy to defeat. I do not think difficulty was the point of this game. I think the main point of it was to just introduce players to the idea, concept, story, and format of the Portal series. All of these four things are artfully designed and are quite entertaining. I think the point of this game is to prepare players for the sequel, Portal 2. I have not played the sequel, so I do not know that for sure. If you're looking for just a fun and quick puzzle game that is relatively easy to master, then this is the game for you. If you are looking for more action in your gameplay, this may not be the game for you. I am one of those people, but I still enjoyed, enjoy, and will enjoy this game for a very long time.

The tutorial system is integrated with the game and very well done, you can tell they put a lot of thought into how people would react to the game so as to not get stuck unable to figure out what to do next. They give you just enough clues to figure things out on your own without making it too easy nor too difficult. The game was a bit shorter than I expected but was complete nonetheless. I played the game twice, once regular and once with developer commentary mode on, and now I'm doing the bonus levels and it's pretty fun. I'm looking forward to completing the rest of the extra content and also looking forward to Portal 2.",

However, this game is a plot-motivated game and upon completing the storyline once or even twice, the player loses interest to play as there is nothing left to discover except playing the fun levels again. That's why users play the game for a significantly shorter duration than other games such as Team Fortress 2  Granted, this game is amazingly great in conceptual and perceptive aspects, with awesome graphics and mechanics, but it's a one-time thing. May not be worth a buy if you plan to get a game that you can play forever, so take my advice:  Wait for the sale",

To compensate for the short 3-4 hour story mode, you can have a go at more difficult versions of the different puzzle rooms that you encountered in the story mode. You can also do timed levels.   I confess that Portal 2 is in my estimation, a better game. However, Portal 1 is a great introduction to the world of Aperture. It is no doubt worth 10 dollars and is a work of art in a diminutive fashion.       Pros: Awesome story    It is funny and charming   There are options for more gameplay after the initial story   10 bucks for this game is a steal   If you like it, you can have 9 more hours with Portal 2's story and even more with mods and   multiplayer (on Portal 2)     Cons: A little short   No multiplayer  ",

(a game which I do not own and do not care about).  Anyway, Portal is a cool-guy standalone game by Valve, obviously. Where were you when this game came out? Probably in your basement waiting for Half-Life 2: Episode Two (I don't know when that game came out, so maybe you were in your basement waiting for Half-Life 3, I don't know). This game was released all the way back in 2007, and for some reason I bought it seven years later when I already had and played the sequel.  Portal's gameplay is nothing like we've ever seen before, something that has never been done before. It uses portals, NO DUR! It's got cool puzzles and cool mechanics, nothing more to say. The mechanics are innovative and easy to learn. The Portal Gun is the center object of the game, if you've seen the trailer you probably know what it does. Go in one portal, come out the other and move it around with the gun it come from (BRING IT AROOUUND TOWN SQUIDWARD).  The story is a bit under wraps, it's kind of hard to notice if you don't pay much attention to it. This game does have a somewhat noticable story, but you'll be focusing too much on the puzzles to notice (look for the Easter eggs, bro!).  The game, to be honest, is short. About 18 maps in total (as in maps I don't mean test chambers/levels, I mean actual Source maps). The game is very fun though, I'll tell you that.  This game started the very trend that Valve always goes through when creating video games: Make a game, make an awesome sequel to that game, stop, and make every person that played and liked that game ticked off and die of hype.   The only criticism I have with Portal is the short number of mechanics and the game being short in general. But all in all, Portal is a very fun game. In case you didn't know, this game has WAY less mechanics than Portal 2 does.  Portal is very, very cool. It got an awesome sequel, a few mods both for that sequel and this game itself, and an ever-growing workshop for its sequel. But it just needs a little something, let me tell you what it is: ANOTHER SEQUEL. HEY VALVE, CAN YOU HEAR ME SCREAMING AT YOU, DEMANDING THAT YOU MAKE A PORTAL 3?! Probably not, it's not like you'd care or anything.  Thank you for reading this somewhat short review on Portal. Have a nice day, and thank you for flying with American Airlines.

For those who have never played a Portal game, I recommend starting with this one before playing Portal 2.  This is an all-puzzle game where you solve puzzles by utilizing portals you lay yourself. The thing that was so cool about this game when I first saw it is that not only can you shoot the portals wherever you want, but the game actually renders what's on the other side of the portal. You don't just walk up to the portal and just magically get spawned where the other portal is. You actually walk through it.  Plot: You are a human test subject being held captive in an abandoned test facility. The only one left in the facility is the AI that controls it all, and forces you to continue her 'tests.' Your greatest ally is the portal gun, a 'gun' that shoots portals onto certain surfaces.  Pros: +Great sense of humor +Engaging puzzles +Sense of mystery and intrigue, despite the humor +Perfectly paced +Bonus puzzles and challenges to work on after beating the game +In-game developer commentary available  Cons: None  If it isn't obvious from the trailer, this game is controlled like an FPS.  The game will take less than four hours to beat, but I don't list that as a con, because to my knowledge Valve has always sold this game at a reduced price compared to a full AAA game. This game really is an experience to play. It is one of my all-time favorites and comes with my highest recommendation.",

If you want to experience where it all began, however, I highly recommend this games.",

As a brief summary of this game here's a quote from a massive portal fan (me): 'This game is definately worth buying even if it's not on sale. But if you're going to get Portal, why not get Portal 2? If you like sci-fi you'll  love  this. And even if you don't, still buy it.'  TL;DR: Buy it. Now. Even if you have no money just disobey the laws of mathematics and buy it.

Unlike the Half Life series where action-adventure mixed with science fiction and horror dominate the games. Portal is famously known for it's puzzles, simple yet challenging puzzles. Some puzzles might be obvious but other times it 'might' be obvious and then GLaDOS pulls a troll on you and you have to think more and more. If you thought rage quitting at Dark Souls was a thing. Try rage quitting at something so simple, a child could beat this game. And yes, there are many players in the past, and present who still get frustrated with some of the puzzles.   The game offers developer commentary (which I highly recommend). The game also has challenge puzzles and advance test chambers for you to play on. There are easter eggs in this game as well. Not obvious so be aware at all times. Lastly, GLaDOS for an AI entity has never been more amazing than any other AI entity in video game history. Her witty sarcasm attitude towards you in either serious or playful banter makes the game much more enjoyable.   I highly recommend this game to any and all puzzle fans. This one is surely for you.

Sci-fi fans out there, if you haven't played this game, you are missing out.  The game is short but the length is perfect. You will come out of enraptured, wanting for more and the best part of it is that Portal 2 is now here, ready and waiting for you and it lives up to the titanic expections set by its predecessor.  If I had only one video game I could be allowed to play again for the first time, it would be this.",

            "review_text": "No cakewalk this one  This is one clever game. The concept is simple but brilliant: you’re trapped in the labs of Aperture Science and you have to get out. To assist you you’re given a portal gun. The gun opens doorways in almost any surface. Once you have full control of the gun you can create blue and amber portals. Step into the blue one and you emerge from the amber one, step into the amber one and you emerge from the blue one. By positioning the portals in certain ways you can step, jump, or fall huge distances. You can also use them to redirect lasers and bullets, which you must do in order to stay alive. All through your efforts to escape you’re teased and goaded by GLaDoS, the AI that runs the lab. As with all Valve games the writing is excellent, with GLaDoS delivering some perfectly-pitched lines (and a cute little song at the end). Each challenge is more difficult than the last but none is so frustrating as to annoy, and all are satisfying when solved. My only criticism is that the maps lack variety as you travel from one austere lab to another, or from one utility area to another (this appears to have been addressed in Portal 2, which offers a wider range of environments). All-in-all this is one of the most imaginative games I’ve ever encountered. Check out the Orange Box though, because this offers the excellent Half-Life 2 games and Portal as a bundle and is great value.  4/5",

But we will also be a country of law and order. Our Convention occurs at a moment of crisis for our nation. The attacks on our police, and the terrorism in our cities, threaten our very way of life. Any politician who does not grasp this danger is not fit to lead our country. Americans watching this address tonight have seen the recent images of violence in our streets and the chaos in our communities. Many have witnessed this violence personally, some have even been its victims. I have a message for all of you: the crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon come to an end. Beginning on January 20th 2017, safety will be restored. The most basic duty of government is to defend the lives of its own citizens. Any government that fails to do so is a government unworthy to lead. It is finally time for a straightforward assessment of the state of our nation. I will present the facts plainly and honestly. We cannot afford to be so politically correct anymore. So if you want to hear the corporate spin, the carefully-crafted lies, and the media myths the Democrats are holding their convention next week. But here, at our convention, there will be no lies. We will honor the American people with the truth, and nothing else.",

This game is awesome, from its puzzles to its story to its characters. It may not have a ton of replay value, but it is still a worthwhile purchase that people will love.

Portal is a strategic puzzle game, with of course portals.   The game starts you out with waking up from a futuristic bed, (trying not to spoil much here). A robotic-woman voice announces that you are going to go through a series of tests and that the main goal here is to have fun, although some major injuries may occur. Later in the game you encounter the portal gun. With this, you can   shoot and create you're own portals.   You must use these Portals to solve many puzzles you encounter. You will also have to use Weighted Companion cubes to help you access closed doors.   Now moving on the the Graphics and Performance. The graphics to this day are still AMAZING. Valve does a great job on making a plain game look so GOOD. As for performance, i NEVER lost my 60 fps, so the performance is PERFECT. With my PC specs, this game was able to run at the highest settings without a single problem! The performance and graphics on Portal are Spot-on PERFECT! :D   The game itself is amazing, but only one thing threw me off:   THE MAIN GAME IS ONLY AROUND 2-3 HOURS LONG.   The game itself is VERY short, which may ruin the whole experience for a lot of players.  But luckily, the game expands SO much more once you have completed the main game itself, unlocks the main 13-16 chambers of the main game, and adds mini challenges to the 6 chambers, known has the   Challenge Chambers.",

As far as the game is concerned there's nothing really fundamentally flawed about it. It's not broken in any technical sense. It does provide entertainment. It does looks nice. So on and so on.  Unfortunately, I completed it in one sitting of ~82 minutes, playing casually. So yes it's short. But short games can still be great. This however isn't one of those because, there is no replay value (short of hunting a grand total of 15 achievements). Really there's only one way to finish a level; so once the puzzle is solved, it's solved. There aren't really any easter eggs, no multiplayer, no alternate endings, nothing to make me want to come back to it.  Even among all the positive reviews for Portal, the average game time is much LESS than 10 hours.  My recommendation: find a friend who has it, play it and be done with it. Alternatively, Steam has so many sales on many other games that provide much better bang for buck in terms of value, all the time. You won't miss much having this curious but forgettable item in your library.  ---EDIT--- I would like to state that at the time I wrote this, the full price was USD$20, which was the point of my review. It's a game everyone should experience, but it wasn't worth the full price considering the amount of, or lack of content that the average player would experience (which you can see from all the other reviews is only a few hours with the exception of some who managed almost 30).  The game is now 10$ which is better, but even then I would wait for a sale. It's not a reflection of the games technical quality, but rather the value of entertainment to cost when compared to other games availabe which provide much better ratio.  Either way, thanks for reading! ---/EDIT---",

            "review_text": "Last Played: May 2014 PROS: + GLADOS is actually really funny + Looks good, even after 6 years CONS: - Really short and really easy - Neither revolutionary nor evolutionary REVIEW: If we are being honest, Portal is not a puzzle game, despite many claims to the contrary. It is a 'puzzle-ish' game for people who like shooters. I liked that it was difficult to die, since it made it easier to focus on finding solutions to the 'puzzles', but even with easy deaths the hard part about this game isn't figuring out what to do, it is doing it with somewhat fiddly controls (played using an XBOX 360 controller). Still, if the game disappoints on puzzle satisfaction, it really delivers on dry humor. Your handler, GLADOS is very funny and when she sings the credits song you can't help but grin. The graphics are still shiny (some texture mapping looks bad, but doesn't detract too badly) even after 6 years, which is no small feat as games start to age. As others have said, the level of difficulty will probably see you finishing the base game in less than 3 hours, even if you get stuck-a disadvantage since it significantly boosts your $ cost per hour of entertainment. This also hurts a decision to buy because Portal introduced no really new elements to physics puzzlers nor did it do them especially better, it seems to owe its current popularity to previously high reviews (much like Angry Birds).  Still, one of the best measures of a game is whether you'll remember it after you're done, and I have to say I will remember Portal. Just don't spend more than $5 on it.",

Rounding out at roughly 2 1/2 hours total, this game is an amazing journey. Mechanics is the word that comes to mind when reviewing this game.  Visuals:  Simple surroundings (square rooms, bland halways, same elevator....) won't turn any heads or break any rules....that is until you start walking through walls...again and again. Portal animations are done well including being able to watch yourself run through the portal you're running through. The character model animations are a little stiff, but since there isn't any 3rd person option this doesn't really play a major role. Trust me when I say that you'll be to busy making yourself dizzy running through portals to worry about watching yourself...run through portals.  Gameplay:  Simple until you get to the more reactionary parts of the later game. Dying isn't a punishment as you start back at the begining of the smaller puzzles while the larger ones have checkpoints (sometimes multiple) so you don't have to waste time from the start. This game focuses on simple mechanics (4 or 5 i think) and then extrapilates them (in different combinations) into a 2 1/2 hour experience. This more often than not has been done poorly by previous games but when parred with a comical (homicidal) mainframe, it makes for an enjoyable romp.  Sound:  Foot steps sound normal as does the landing sound after jumping or falling. No death sound is used (you won't miss it...) though one was used for the multiple security drones you encounter (and will inevitably oust.) The star in this game (concerning sound) is by far the mainframe computer out to kill you for her experiments. Her dry (logical) take on your circumstances (and your hopeful demise) is ALWAYS well timed to break up any transition as well as giving the player a well timed laugh. I found myself playing the game again just to hear what she had to say...again....  Overall:  I love this game. It's something that my children have attempted to play and enjoy (though the later levels are beyond their skill level) and one I've loved playing again and again. I can't wait to play it again if for no other reason than to listen to the credits again.     The cake is a lie.      .....or is it?",

The game version which is available in Steam was release on 10th October 2007 as a content of Orange Box. There are many other versions of this game. This game concept came from the game 'Narbacular Drop'. When valve designed the game there are many developer from Narbacular Drop developer team. The latest release of this game was an Android port for the NVidia Shield which was released on 12th May 2014. A sequel, Portal 2, was released in 2011.   This game is designed with several sets of puzzles which are distributed into 19 Test Chambers. The player character Chell have to solve the puzzles using teleporting. At the starting point of every test chamber there is a projector for briefing. Chell have to grab “the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device” also known as portal gun. By using that gun Chell can make two kinds of portals one is blue portal other is orange portal. From game play we come to know that Chell is solving these puzzles as the Aperture Science Enrichment Center promised to give her a cake at the end of all 19 tests. Throughout the game the artificial intelligence GLaDOS (Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System) will monitor Chell. At the end of last test chamber we come to know that the promise of cake is fake. The main objective of the game is to solve 19 puzzles &amp; rescue herself form that fake promise. At the end of the game if you can destroy GLaDOS you can get that promised cake. Though from the game play we came to know 'The cake is lie'. But as per my point of view it's not a lie.   This science fiction game is not as long as valve’s other games, it takes hardly 2-3 hours to complete the 19 puzzles, though till date over four million copies of the game have been sold. The player character Chell is portrayed by Alésia Glidewell &amp; voiced by Mary Kae Lrvin. GLaDOS is voiced by Ellen McLain in English-language version and finally the end credits song “Still Alive” written by Jonathan Coulton also sang by Ellen McLain.  Though it’s a short game but still I’ll recommend to purchase &amp; play. I’m sure after playing you will realize why this game is so popular till date. Now I'm waiting for Portal 2",

Don't let the word 'puzzle' fool you into getting the idea that this is a typical puzzle game though, it's very action packed. The entire game revolves around the concept that there are blue portals, and orange portals, and that objects and people who pass through one portal appear out the other. You use the portals to navigate the stages, alter the paths of moving objects, and to use momentum to 'fling' yourself around the stages. The game is very short, so you could easily play through it in a single run. Those who want more can play the advanced chambers, which are remastered versions of story chambers that have been modified to be more challenging. If that isn't enough, the game has a surprisingly deep story. I recommend this to anyone who wants a quick fix, or a little change from the 'shoot 'em up' norm that video games have come to.",

With its short single-player campaign, and its stripped down graphics (close in term of quality to Half Life 2, released years prior), Portal was to be considered as a bonus in the Orange Box, or even some kind of draft.  Yet, Portal managed to stir up the curiosity and the interest of the gaming community. First, the story line is as simple as it is mysterious. Portal is set in the Half Life universe, seemingly at the same time as the first Half Life. The main character is Chell, a young and mute Gordon Freeman-like woman, who wakes up in a huge complex, belonging to Aperture Science, the main competitor of Black Mesa. Chell will be guided by GLaDOS, a strange AI, through a series of 'tests', in order to attend some kind of 'party'.  What first looks like a training level slowly evolves toward a mix of FPS and puzzle game, as the player will have to use the portal gun to solve the 'tests', which consists in 3D physics enigmas. Create a blue and an orange portal, and what goes through one portal comes out of the other with the same momentum. You then will have to use the law of physics to solve the puzzles. This original concept provides a very interesting and intelligent challenge. It's just a shame that Portal was developped as a mini-game, so it's neither long nor difficult.  But aside form this originality, the atmosphere of Portal is quite intriguing. Nothing is explained regarding to why Chell is here, or to who she is (hence the simplicity of the sotry !). And as she travels through this disturbingly empty complex, she is permanently lectured by GLaDOS. The AI was seeminlgy conceived as a twisted version of HAL 9000, with its quiet voice, but dangerous schemes and worrying speech elements. And let's not forget the famous and popular closing song, 'Still Alive', sung by GLaDOS.  All of this allow for a unique experience, that I recommend you to try, at least for a few hours (you won't need much more to complete the campaign).",

I purchased this game on Steam during last year's Summer Sale as part of the Valve Complete Pack at an awesome price. The gameplay is brilliant, the level design is superb, and the two characters are well crafted, Chell (yourself), and GLaDOS. There is never a dull moment in this game, and the replay value is extraordinary. My only complaint with this game is it only has about 3 hours of main story content, which feels kind of lacking. But this game deserves to be owned by everyone on Steam. Definitely pick up this game and the sequel when you have the chance. 39 Triangles/42 Triangles",

            "review_text": "I feel that three things must be stressed for those like myself who arrived late to the party:  1) Portal is a classic, and absolutely worth playing if you haven't done so yet. Even if puzzle games are not generally your cup of tea, this game takes a unique approach to the genre, exploiting many different creative facets of its relatively simple gameplay mechanics. But the highlight of this game, as I see it, is its extremely witty and often downright hilarious dialogue (or perhaps monologue would be a more appropriate word).  2) That said, if you are still uncertain about whether or not you will enjoy this game, I feel compelled to recommend that you wait until its on sale to make the purchase. My reason for this is that the full campaign is disappointingly short (my friend and I both beat the entire game in 3.5 hours)... about 2 hours into the game, the plot takes a twist of sorts, and suddenly gains significant momentum that almost gives the impression that the main crux of the game is finally starting. But no such luck... about an hour later, you realize you've beaten the game, which feels like it ends right after it truly begins.   3) Replay value is low in my opinion. Recently I let my friend play through it on my computer while I watched, and I found that I remembered practically every solution right away. However, even merely sitting in the passenger seat as my friend traversed the angular corridors of Aperture Science Laboratories, I found myself thoroughly entertained by the clever writing... and, of course, my friend's confused frustration in all the same sections of the game that I struggled with.  Conclusion: Even if this isn't the type of game you would normally be interested in, I think most will quickly discover why this game has received such acclaim throughout the years. I think most gamers should not hesitate to add this game to their library... assuming the price is right ($9.99 for an old game that is *so* short might be hard to justify for some, but if you happen to find it on sale, waste no time in picking it up).",

The environment of Aperature Science and GLaDOS is phenomenal. The story, or whatever the overarching concept should be called, it cool too. But I didn't like the game.  I picked it up for free when I first got a steam account as part of a special offer. I know, I know -- if it's free, I shouldn't be complaining about it, but I just don't understand what all the hype is about. There are plenty of more dynamic puzzlers out there, and the test chambers are boring and repetitive for the first 75% of the game. The challenges have standards that are set ridiculously high (it took me literally the entire time I've had a Steam account to beat it), and that makes achievement hunting on Portal a very frustrating experience.   The largest detractor for me, however, is the face people make when I say I don't like Portal. There appears to be some law in the gaming world that I /must/ love this game. I played it, I beat it. I even finally got all the achievements, but I still feel the same way. I understand why others may like it, but I don't. The only mystery left is why I can't seem to have my own individual preferences.   The cultural enshrinement of Portal is well-deserved. Like I said, I understand why people would like this game. It just never really appealed to me, however, and after the first playthrough, I was quite ready to be done with it. I can only hope that the stigma attached to my dislike of this game isn't a burden shared by others (the measley few percent) that also gave Portal a negative review. It's actually quite a hassle.  I didn't like this game. I want to not recommend it. But I will anyway, because I know you will.",

This I feel is the main let down, there are enemies in the game but very little the game doesn't mix things up.  You have probably heard already that this game is very short. My first play through was just under 1hr 30mins which is really short for a game but it needed to be shortened otherwise it would've just dragged on and got boring after. Portal comes with some bonus levels and those are rather short too but a good fun time-waster, I now play these bonus maps in the background while waiting for games to load up.To be honest there is not much I can say other than its the best puzzle game I have ever played so far. Unlike puzzles in Zelda these ones are actually fun to complete and require no backtracking whatsoever. I am keeping this review short because the game it self is short and I have said all there is to say.

If you like brain teasers, then once you get through the intro levels, this is the game for you.

Garry's mod also has this, but it's more of a small sandbox with a ton of tools, whereas this game has structure and narrative.

This seems to break videogame laws since ( as oppossed to films as famously stated in Scream 2) video games generally get better with age, kind of like Monica Belluci. All you have to do is update the graphics a bit, add more enemies, fix a fre flaws in the original and voila? A better game, right?  Well I don't know if it's always that simple, sure for a game that depends on graphics, guns and enemies (not being elitist here I love those games) you can just add more but when games rely on a concept or emotion primarily to work they don't necessarily get better with iteration.  One example of this would be the Final Fantasy series, since the core of an RPG relates to your investment in the world and characters and can be established just as well with sprites and SNES's as with super impressive visuals its perhaps not surprising this series hasn't neccessarily got better at a linear rate. When the world exploration has to be sacrificied for high fidelity visuals it lends to a very unsatisfying 'sugar high' type experience.  I guess the other point relates to the fact that sometimes the thing we love about the game isn't what we think. For example after playing Tomb Raider many people wanted more action but Tomb Raider 2 (although still awesome, I mean you could fight yeti's with an M16 in that game, come on) actually seemed to sacrifice some of the enjoyment of exploration when it throw more bad guys at you.  Portal is more in the third category kind of like the films of M Night Shamalayn, the game arguably was so memorable because it was so different, so when you add in a sequel (however well designed) the game simply can't recapture that 'wow' factor of the original.",

GAMEPLAY  If you like a good story, try Portal 2. If you're more focused on puzzles, play both Portal and Portal 2 (and get the Portal Level Pack in LEGO Dimensions, like I did) because in this game you'll be taking on lots of puzzles. There are 19 test chambers, an escape sequence and a finale to play through, and you have to rely on the Portal Gun, a machine that can create gateways, to get from entrance to exit. I came into the game thinking 'Oh I'll just fire a portal by the entrance, fire one at the exit and then be off' but that's when you find out about the gun's one weakness - black walls. You'll also be using plenty of cubes to activate buttons and deflect lasers, and you'll encounter the GODAWFUL TURRETS!  THE TURRETS ARE ONE OF THE MOST ANNOYING THINGS I'VE MET IN ANY GAME! THEIR STUPID HIGH PITCHED VOICES! I EVEN HAD TO GET MY FRIEND TO COMPLETE THE FIRST TURRET CHAMBER!   I just smashed up the turret I got in the LEGO Dimensions Portal pack.

You are a test subject within the science labs deep below the surface, used to test the 'portal gun', a device which, funnily enough, allows you to make hot fudge sunday, well, only in an alternative universe, in this one however, it makes portals. Your goal is to beat each room, learning the mechanics of the game while getting messed around by a psychotic AI.  The gameplay is simple, you have a gun, it shoots a blue and a orange portal, allowing you to travel between them. Using this single mechanic and basic movement, you must solve reach room in turn. Where the game shines is the creativity of both the puzzles and the way it forces you to think outside the box, while inside a box. Each puzzle feels satisfying to beat and your reward for beating them, another puzzle, even better than the last. Later on the game gets more fast paced and forces you to use all that you've learned, and apply them offensively.  Where portal truly shines however is its humor. It starts off rather tame and slowly eases you into a range of odd ball humor, normally centred around insulting you, or just being mean in general. I rarely comes off as completely mean spirited however, and from my experience, rather light hearted and teasing whenever its aimmed at you, whenever its on a different topic its creative. The big star of the game, glados, is the source of all this banter, everything she says is golden, even if she is the main antagonist, she's lovable in the way only an entertaining bad guy can be.  Portal also features a rather simple visual style, which is deliberate if you consider that the entire thing is based in a testing facility. This not only helps remove any enviromental confusion when solving puzzles, only allowing you to focus on the raw elements of each one, but really does help hammer home a feeling of isolation, not only due to a lack of other people, but a lack of sensory stimulation. There is an interesting aspect of psychology at play here and studies documenting the effects of sensory deprivation, something which this game does apply rather well to an extent. The game does have music, and when you focus on it the music is rather delightful, it has a very clean, syth style that does not use any traditional instrument. But its very easy to forget that it is even there at times.  Overall, portal is a classic which deserves its place in gaming history, its a fantastic puzzle game and is nothing short of satisfying from start to finish. I would recommend this to anyone, as its perfect for people new to gaming, vets of the entire medium and will be able to keep the attention of just about anyone, regardless of taste.",

Here is the one and only possible legitimate criticism of Portal:  'I don't like puzzle games.'  I will follow this up with more ridiculous statements. This game is the best game ever made. It is a master-class in blending design and humor, technical work and art. It came out of nowhere and did not overstay its welcome. I will follow this up with more outrageous statements. If you think Portal is an objectively bad game, you don't understand games. Or maybe you are immature, an idiot, high, drunk or all of these things. Either way your taste in games, at the very least, is terminaly skewed, and you must flock to someone of a more discerning palate for guidance in the rest of your life. For the rest of you, if you never play another game, spend the 5 cents and play this game. You will not regret it. And if you do you have bigger issues to spend time regretting.",

I've beaten this game countless times, it really is one of my favorite games, I probably like it just as much as Portal 2, the game that a lot of people I know like better than the original.  Where do I start. This game is still as good as it was 7 years ago (Wow! It's been that long). The Graphics are a 10/10 they still look amazing today. For the few songs that play in the game, they fit in perfectly and help you immerse yourself, 10/10. When I first saw this game I was skeptical if I would be fast enough to place Portals, don't worry though, this game is easy to get into and there is basically no learning curve, although ths doesn't mean it is an easy game, I remember a few chambers taking me about an hour the first time I played it, although they were still enjoyable while trying to find out what to do. Gameplay gets a 10/10. The story, what story. The presentation is good, everything feels connected. The envirnments aren't anything too fancy to look at, with some bland textures, but I'm pretty sure this was done on purpose to ad to the feel that you are in a testing lab, it isn't supposed to look fancy. Presentation gets a 8/10.  Usually this would average in for a clean 9.5, but this game is so fabtastic, I think I'll just give it a 10/10.  Great game, I higly recommend any person that has a Steam account to buy this.  To put it into simpler terms, if this game was a potato, it would be a very good potato.",

            "review_text": "Portal is a short first person 3D puzzle game that was designed to be in the Orange Box, along with Half Life 2, Half Life 2 Episodes One and Two, and Team Fortress 2. In the game, you play as Chell, a silent protagonist who navigates her way through Apeture Laboratories, a testing faucility for the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device (ASHPD), or Portal Gun.   The Portal Gun shoots two portals: an orange and blue one. If you go through one, you come out the other. You use these portals to solve puzzles, or test chambers. You are commentated on by GLADoS, a seemingly friendly A.I. You are promised cake and grief counseling at the end of the chambers by GLADoS, but as you make your way through the lonely test chambers, you start to suspect that not only is there something wrong with GLADoS, but with Aperture Laboratories itself.   The game itself is brilliant, with difficult puzzles and intriguing plot, this game is all around wonderfull. My only complaint is that the game is too short. On your first playthrough, it will take you 2 hours max to complete the game. And that's being too generous. I understand that they had to make it short because the main game in the Orange Box was Half Life 2, but they could have added more puzzles.    Another interesting feature of the game if you're into video game backstory is the fact that this game fits into the Half Life universe. So if you like finding all the cute little easter eggs that connect the games together, go for it. However, Portal 2 has more crossovers to Half Life.    This is one of my favorite games of all time, and I will give this game a 9/10 for the shortness. If you haven't played Portal, fork out the extra ten dollars, enjoy this exellent game, and remember that the cake is a lie.",

Many of the games I'm finishing are such classic games as Portal. I actually bought Portal as part of a Steam sale a few years ago when it was one of the games on Steam that actually played on the Mac. So Portal has been around since 2007 and now 7 years later I played through it and what a great experience it was. As somone who mostly reaches for a players guide especially in games like this I actually played through the 19 levels of Portal only having to check a guide twice (mostly on level 19 and one of the two times I was actually doing what I needed to do just not clicking in the right place). My enjoyment and overall feel of accomplishment actually figuring out the levels on my own was very fullfilling. Portal is not a long game, for me I spent about 5 hours total, there are bonus maps but I've not played them at this time. So I guess this isn't really a review but rather an overview of my enjoyment of the game, a game that is probably at this point just more of an intro to actually moving on to Portal 2, which of course I plan to do now. At $10 Portal has enough content but it's often on sales for $5 or less or in a bundle, if you don't own it and are thinking about it, just stop thinking and pick it up. You owe it to yourself and your gaming collection.",

Instead of being able to lift and launch items with the Gravity Gun, you get a neat, a possibly more useful, device known as the Aperture Science Handheld Quantum Tunneling Device, mostly referred to as a Portal Gun. Wow, Valve must like futuristic guns... Anyway, this device can fire a blue portal (left-click) and a red/orange portal (right-click). These portals are spacially linked, so, in simple terms, place something in one portal and it'll exit out of the other. Throughout the game, you are guided through various chambers, which require the use of the Portal Gun, by an automated feminine voice, which belongs to the CPU of the entire facility, known as Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System, or GLaDOS for short. The voice seems to desire to help you, promising you a portion of cake in the end, but can you really trust this machine? With great gameplay, intriguing mechanics, an epic final battle, and an extremely popular credits theme, this game is downright amazing, and I recommend it to any puzzle fanatics or gamers in general.

Preservation of momentum included when entering one portal and exiting the other. Your goal is to creatively use those portals to get yourself out of test chambers.  The puzzling thinking-with-portals experience is greatly enhanced with a humorous (and progressively darker) engrossing ongoing story set in Half-Life universe, that puts you in shoes of a silent protagonist Chell, a test subject of Aperture Science's (perma 2nd place rival of Black Mesa) now-famous AI, GLaDOS.  The game taken everyone by surprise with its perfect polish. It's an inspiring success story of student university project, Narbacular Drop (available free), taken under wings of a successful game studio.  Portal may be considered bit short, the main story is finished in a matter of hours, pretty much in one setting, as you won't stop until it's done, and hearing the 'I'm still alive' (end credits song) is really a cathartic experience (that also makes you wonder.. really? she's alive? ok, possibly sequel incoming - true enough obviously nowadays).  But the shortness mostly means there's no extra filler fluff, however there are additional challenges awaiting those who want more after finishing the story - a few tougher versions of some chambers and time trials / minimum portals trials and some nicely designed achievements to keep you busy longer.",

The game starts out with simple puzzles, introducing concepts which get used later on in more difficult puzzles, such as flinging, and teaches you to associate certain objects with other objects. You only get one item throughout the game - the Portal Gun, which is upgraded very early on - and there's no time limit to complete the chambers. Even the final boss, which is timed, gives you more than enough time. Add a dark sense of humour and a well-written, minimalist cast on top, and you have a masterpiece.",

So the puzzle is to make your way through the labyrinth of the game by solving the spatial problems put before you. You get to jump onto moving platforms, and pick up and deposit objects to help you. There are also things that shoot at you.  But what makes the game particularly interesting is the bizarre computer HAL type overseer that accompanies you through the game, promising cake at one moment, then threatening to kill you the next.

Pros: - Great gameplay mechanics - Mysterious and captivating story - Tutorials are actually part of the story, not just some extra levels added at the beginning - Great voice acting (and manipulation), art and attention to detail in objects and level design. - Difficulty of puzzles never makes you get stuck in one point without knowing what to do. It never interrupts your gaming experience.  Cons: - Short duration  Highly recommended, even more when it is on sale.",

However, there are many hours outside the main story manifested in challenges and advanced chambers. The story is rather shallow, consisting only of the interaction between you and GLaDOs. However the script writer really needs a metal the script IS rather humorous. Combat is almost non-existant, the closest thing being the puzzles involving turrets (who are rather likeable), and they are quite easy to dispatch as long as you get behind them.    Would I recommend this? Yes. This is an incredibly good game. BUT. It's overshadowed by it's successor, Portal 2.

The comedy never stops. Whilst being for slightly more attentive players (the third time playing through I finally got all the jokes) and the story nice and simple. As you go through, you start to see more of how GLaDOS acts, and get hints of what is happening on the outside.  The concept is simple: you are trapped in Aperture Science Laboratories, and an AI named GLaDOS is basically forcing to do puzzles the promise of a certain confectionary at the end. You can fire a 'Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device' to create portals to reach the exit of all puzzles, which get progressively harder.  The game is set in the same universe as Half Life. We can see this from multiple things, such as a chart in a side room displaying such things as the profits of Black Mesa and Aperture, and GLaDOS references to the dangers outside at one or two points.  So, all in all, this game is brilliant. 19/10. I'm GLaD I bought this game, OSo GLaD.

I would start then with a very short list of the things that DID bother me, First, well, the length of course. Nothing new here. I do believe it simply wasn't meant to be too long in the first place but more like a side content to The Orange Box back in the day, but still. Also, soundtrack was a little disappointing in my opinion. And, before completing the main game, I've seen that there are 'challenges' and 'advanced maps', and imagined that they would add more content to the game, but figured out later that these are merely a revisions of the original maps from the campaign.  So, just let me confess here, that Portal didn't completely live up to my expectations. (~Hiding myself from possibly thrown objects~) As this game is so positively accepted I did expect something more. Being so short and the lack of additional content in the base game didn't help much. It was fun but ended too soon, and the story just felt... meeeh. And the challenges started to feel too crazy for me as soon as they started depending on trial&amp;error\\some luck, facts which I don't like!  I did grow a lot fonder of Portal as I played through the developers commentary. Hearing their thoughts and the game-making process made me appreciate everything much more, somehow. I even liked better that 'Still Alive' song which at first seemed bizzare and weird to me.  Anyway, I'm not going to fully review this game and describe all of it's good aspects, because you probably know them already, and if not (!?) then you should experience it yourself, even by trying the demo. Just wanted to share my little story of falling in love with the game.  Portal is without a doubt a very extraordinary puzzle game, brilliantly original, and I doubt we'll ever see any other game of the kind. Many other games tried to follow Portal's lead and so far I didn't encounter much success among these attempts.  It goes constantly on sale, and it's actually worth the full price of 10$ as well.

You had no weapons aside from your mind and the ability to place two different colored portals to deal with such challenges. Portal also offers separate challenges to complete if you feel the main game is not enough.  Pick this up with the Orange Box or as a stand alone. Either way, it's usually a bargain.

The concept is great and the physics work well with everything. Graphics and colors where nice and even great considering the age of the game.   I do see where some people are coming from about the 'negatives' of portal such as; it being short, not worth the money, too easy, too hard, or no replay value. I agree that it is short and at some points rather easy, i did see 'bonus maps' so hopefully that adds the replay value. as for the overall value of the game i bought it along with the ORANGE BOX so i feel like i had a good mix of games for the price ALSO it makes buying the portal 2 bundle cheaper if you own portal 1 already. i plan on buying Portal 2 and enjoying the co-op",

Oh, give it a strong protagonist, an intruiging and sinister villian, and a compelling story. That. What I really enjoy about this game is that it doesn't take the story and smash you over the head with it in wall after wall of painful exposition. Some things are spelled out by GlaDos while others you come across and have to piece together for yourself. The game trusts you to figure out what's going on and I appreciate that. Especially after dying on the same level in the same way eight times in a row. It makes me feel al little better about myself. GlaDos is quite possibly the best video game villian ever written. She's funny and terrifying at the same time, like that one aunt everyone avoids at the family christmas party. They could have easily hammed her up and gone overboard with it but somehow managed to find the perfect balance between cold emotionless android and snarky embittered librarian. The puzzels are challenging, but do-able. There is always a solution even though it is not always obvious. Keep at it and solving the tests becomes almost addicting. Once you get to post game and start the challenges it's even worse. The game is very brief and when you play the second game you discover it only barely scrapes the surface of the Portal world, but I feel like that's fair for a game that was released in a bundle with two other games. It's more like an animated short than a box office movie, but you more than get what you pay for. Seriously, you just need to play it. It is SO GOOD. ",

The game takes place entirely in a large advance lab facility called Aperture Labs. Half-Life fans might be familiar with that name as it was mentioned as Black Mesa's competitor in Half-Life 2: Episode 2. Confirming that the game is set in the same universe except focus on a different protagnogist. The main protagnogist is a woman named Chell who is a test subject for Aperture Labs. She awakens in her cell and is greeted by an AI named GlaDOS, who is like a female version of the Hal 9000. GlaDOS monitors Chell throughout the area she is confined in and soon is given instructions to participate in a series of tests in various obstacle courses with only a prototype 'portal gun' as a tool to progress the tests. The portal gun is a highly advance device that shoots out two different rifts of portals: blue and orange. Anything going into the blue portal comes out of the orange portal and vice versa. As Chell goes on her trek of countless obstacles, she eventually discovers that there is something not right about the lab as the windows of the upper floors where the lab staff would normally be present are not there as the spectators and wonders if anyone is stationed at the lab than her. The game offers the same gameplay and layouts as the Half-Life games do except in this game you play as a heroine and the only weapon of choice is a portal gun which you have to use to your advancetage when dealing with various dangers. The puzzles are very well thought up and sometimes appear to be cryptic but there is a solution if you put your mind to it. Portal would go on to being an iconic game in the same level as Counter Strike &amp; Half-Life. Anyone who loves those games will enjoy this game to the core.",

I still play this game and beat it when I am feeling bored and I love to come back and to see what gave birth to a legend and what is a legend.   Gameplay: Portal's gameplay is quite simple, to explain at least. You use portals to your advantage, along with buttons that activate a part of the puzzle. Two buttons are in the game, one that you press and one that you need a cube to put on. There are also lift pads is what I will call them, they take you across the map. Also, there are energy balls (xdxdxd) that kill you if you are hit by one. Lastly, there is DEADLY GOO!! Simple, you fall in, you die. Easy. Not so easy.   Story: To be honest not much story is in this Portal game. Well, at the time. Now theories are everywhere because of the second installment. Anyway, the story basically is that you are a test subject that volunteered a long time ago to test some new gadgets the factory was making. Then GLADOS, the AI that you fight against went rouge and killed everyone working there. You, now go through HER tests and then end up -SSPPOOIILLEERRSS-  Conclusion: Buy Portal.",

The atmosphere, puzzles, soundtrack and level design are all perfectly handcrafted. Portal is also probably the best game for speedrunning I can find. There are plenty of cheeky ways to solve puzzles quickly, and the (non intentional) hard to learn, difficult to master bhopping raises the speedrunning-skill-level even higher. Buy this game. No, seriousely. Even if you can't afford to pay for Portal right now, save up, and buy it.",

It's a game with a strong and unique gameplay and story that is built around it, not the other way around.

The silent protagonist helps the player enjoy the game as they want, either as a clever puzzle platformer or a deepely emotional experience, the latter being my case and indeed the reason why this game stands out. It also doesn't have the audacity to tell you exactly how to feel about certain situations, presents the game world as it is and can affect in many ways - will you feel desperate? Lonely? Terrified? Amused? Will you chuckle at the dark jokes or be shocked by the borderline horror gallows humor. Much of this is caused by the brilliant GLaDOS. Just let me say this, to kinda sum it up: a game that causes me to grow this attached to a piece of fictional metal with a drawn pink heart on it does something very, very right.",

I got this game a few years back when it was free as part of some educational initiatve, and it's proven to be a favorite of mine ever since. Anything I say will pretty much echo what everyone else has said, but this game's praises really do need to be repeated over and over again because it really is that good. The gameplay remains some of the most innovative out there, with unique and fun puzzles that have the perfect balance of challenge and accessibility, and the witty writing always gets a few chuckles out of me. The only con I can think of is that the game is decidedly short, but that is easily made up for by the personality that permeates every single frame.  So, in closing, if you don't already own the game, get it. Like, right now. DO IT!",

The storyline and characters are pretty weak, but that's the only flaw I can find. The graphics are great for a 2007 game and the gameplay is amazing. The concept of solving puzzle rooms may seem mundane, but the intricate physics of the connected portals makes this game one of the funnest games I've ever played. The main storyline serves as an excellent tutorial that gets progressively more difficult and does provide some amusing moments through a subpar storyline. For a real challenge, the game provides bonus maps, wherein I spent majority of my 20 hours of gameplay. Highly recommend for everyone.",

Portal is a short but entertaining game, and I loved it.  To start this off, I've got to talk about the puzzles. One of the reasons that I loved this game so much was because of its sometimes frustrating difficulty. The puzzles are physics-based and require a lot of skill regarding spatial problem solving. But, don't worry, the mechanics are easy to pick up, and the game does a great job of easing you into the gameplay. In fact, the tutorial is worked into the first few levels very well, so its not a pain to sit through. Personally, this game was a satisfying mental challenge, especially in the later levels. Mind you, the puzzles can get annoying at times and may take multiple attempts to solve. The biggest piece of advice I can offer with the puzzles is to pay close attention to your surroundings.   (This paragraph is primarily driven by personal taste: my preference is for games with well-written stories, good lore, and strong characters. It doesn't mean I didn't enjoy this game; I was just a little disappointed. If that kind of stuff doesn't matter that much to you in a game, skip the following paragraph.)  In terms of story, Portal is pretty bland. This game's focus is on the puzzle solving and mechanics, which isn't bad. It just gets tiresome. I got bored in the later test chambers and had a hard time enjoying the game until the   fire escape.   Running around Aperture Laboratories did keep me playing, as it added  some  depth to the world of the game. Unfortunately, this lack of story had a negative effect on the final battle. The battle felt obligatory, like the game was scrambling for a climax. The silver lining is that it does a good job of setting the dynamic between GLaDOS and the player in the sequel.   Yes, Portal has its flaws and isn't exactly the best game in the world, but it's still pretty great. It's a well designed game that provides an excellent mental challenge. The story is a bit weak in this one but does a nice job of leading into the story of the second game. Portal, as a series, is excellent, and both games are wonderful in their own right.",
