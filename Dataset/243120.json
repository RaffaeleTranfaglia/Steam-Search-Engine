            "review_text": "Betrayer is a first-person game, where you awake on a small beach after your ship wrecked.  You are thrown into the game, without any explanation or a real goal first, so you'll start exploring.  Controls are basically like any other first-person game. you can jump, crouch, use your weapons and interact with objects. So, until here, everything is quite the usual.  What makes it so interesting and unique in my opinion, is the visuals.  Yes, having a game being black and white and only highlight enemies and objects with the color red was a great move. It adds a lot(!) to the atmosphere (you can however play with the contrast, and color saturation yourself to make it colorful again, though i wouldn't recommend it).  After you have made your first steps, you encounter quite mysterious happenings. Enemies appear and will try to shoot you on sight, but they don't seem particularly human.  After finding and entering your first settlement, you'll find burned corpses and try to find out what happened to these poor souls and then, there is also that mysterious maiden in red, which appears out of nowhere and then there is also, what i would call, the 'ghost realm' (after ringing a bell in a settlement, everything darkens and you'll end up fighting skeletons and talking to souls, which got murdered).  Together with the visuals, the great sound and the spooky atmosphere it makes a quite good game. The world itself is divided into larger hubs, where you can roam and explore freely, though, there isn't that much to find (graves, some clues and diary-entries which will give you a bit of backstory and few settlements or smaller places of interest). You will find (or buy) different weapons throughout the game, like bows, crossbows, pistols and muskets to fight of the enemies (which you should do stealthy in most cases, as you can't take much damage).  The middle part feels a bit stretched and sometimes, it can be a bit frustrating, not knowing exactly what to do and where to go, but if you like exploring and a rather stealthy first-person mystery game which doesn't take you by the hand, then i would definitely recommend this one!",

            "review_text": "Betrayer is quite extraordinary. Its atmosphere is amazing, with it's beautifully crafted black and white world. But it's an empty world, one that needed way, way more content than this, because the gameplay becomes quite repetitive after a few hours, even if the story is mysterious and intriguing.  You end up washed ashore and you have no idea how you got there or where you even are. Moving forward will act as a small tutorial and once you enter the next area the real game begins. Soon you'll find a deserted village, a village where you find a Maiden In Red (which the story is all about) and a bell. A bell that belongs to the village. Restore the bell and you can ring it, and it will instantly transfer you to an even darker world (please note that that's not quite true; the area remains the same, but the enemies and NPCs become different) where ghosts can be found. These ghosts tell a story and it's up to you to find more clues and solve the many mysteries this world has. You can switch between the light and dark world on the fly with the ring of the village bell and both of these worlds contain clues, found as letters or other objects. With the press of a button you will hear voices and sounds that will guide you in the right direction. Follow the sounds to find your next clue(s). An original concept that works very well, especially because it's an open world. I really liked it.  Of course, there are also enemies to be found and these are actually quite tough at times. But defeat them and they'll drop loot. Loot that you might desperately need later on, because the enemies become harder to defeat. Other ways to gather loot is by buying it from a digital salesman in the village or by find treasure chests scattered across the lands. However, if you get slain by an enemy you'll drop all of your loot and you have one try to get it all back. Die before getting it and you'll lose everything, with no chance of ever recovering it (Dark Souls anyone ?).  Enemies can be killed with stealth. Just use your bow to silently take care of them. Or you can kill them with help of the wind. It will mask your sound. Another original concept that works very well. Unfortunately, the AI disappoints from time to time so it's not always the way to kill off enemies. Enemies might never hear you even if you're only a few metres away from them, and other times they come running to you from miles away. It's all over the place and I was disappointed to see a polished game like this have such crappy AI.  There are several areas in the game and exploration is key for solving the stories. But like I said, it becomes repetitive after a few hours because all you do is look for clues, ghosts and treasure chests and kill enemies. There's not much else to do in this game. Now, I do have to say that it kept my interest all the way through (which lasts about 10 hours), mainly because there's no handholding. The lore and stories are yours to interpret. And this is exactly what also made Dark Souls so fun to play. You get small hints of what's happening or happened and it's up to you to think of what might have actually happened. Good stuff !  Betrayer is an excellent game and I'd love to see a sequel. But please, fix the AI and make the world itself a bit more interesting to explore. Recommended !  [Rating: 78/100]",

            "review_text": "Betrayer is a curious game. It's a horror game, with a semi-open world to explore. It's a shooter, but it encourages stealth. It even shuffles some RPG elements in there for good measure. The end result is an experience that's quite unlike anything I've ever played.   The game starts off with you washing up on a beach in 16th-century Virginia. As you make your way inland, you discover the nearest colony has been overtaken by a mysterious force: one that turned the local populace into ashes and changed a Spanish invasion force into feral beasts. You meet the enigmatic Maiden in Red, whose past is tied to this place in ways she cannot yet remember. As you venture through the forests you uncover more abandoned settlements, each with their own history and ghosts left behind to tell it. You'll face a multitude of strange creatures, brought forth by the plague ravishing the Frontier. The combat can get a bit clunky, but the novelty of shooting monsters with muskets and crossbows makes up for that. Exploration can get a bit dull, since the world mostly looks the same. I had to resort to using an online map for each of the game's segments in order to get the full experience.  Each map of the game world is strewn with collectables. These range from journal pages left by the people to graves and clues you find in the wilderness. Speaking with wraiths can give you valuable insight into the tragedies that occured here, even before the world went to hell. There's some interesting stories to be found, and they all receive a form of closure. The way you handle them can also have an impact on the ending of the game, but don't expect the effect to be too great. The ending itself is also strange, and leaves a lot open to interpretation (and the inevitable sequel), but the game's climax is satisfying enough to overlook that.  Betrayer is definitely not easy. The enemies pack quite a punch, even on the lowest difficulty setting. There's not a lot of guides on there online, either, so you'll have to find your own way through the intricate maze of Colonial history the developers have crafted. Figuring it out is immensely satisfying, though, and I'd definitely recommend everyone to play this game.",

            "review_text": "For whom the bell tolls  Blackpowder Games deserve praise for attempting something a little different with BETRAYER, and although it remains, at heart, an action RPG, they have succeeded in taking the genre in an unusual and interesting direction. This is a game that’s big on atmosphere, even if it is a tad light on content. Visually the game is quite unique, and the small indie studio have managed to create a world that’s far more eery and mysterious than can be found in most AAA horror titles. And this creepy atmosphere is further enhanced by excellent audio design. The combat is fun and reasonably challenging, and it does stealth pretty well too. It would, perhaps, gain something from a wider variety of environments and maybe from some voice acting, but on the whole this is an excellent little game. And it’s also great value for money. Some have criticised BETRAYER for being repetitive but personally I found my 26 hours within the game thoroughly enjoyable, and it never felt like a grind. And I managed to get all the achievements – huzzah! Sequel please. 4/5",

            "review_text": "For me, this is a difficult game to rate as it is a combination of genres the main being adventure horror and FPS unfortunately, as another person stated in a previous review I found it almost impossible to relate to the characters in the adventure element of the story but, really enjoyed the FPS part. Perhaps that was the problem, the FPS element was, for me, more fun than the adventure and therefore I didn't really play it or want to play it like an adventure, I usually enjoy adventures but, found that here I was only playing the adventure out of necessity to progress the FPS. IMHO the story was complex to the point where I felt the it was holding me back from progressing and became just incidental rather than in integral part of the game. The cross referencing between people places clues and events involves flipping between menus to understand the multiple links which to me seemed to impede the progress of the game. Whilst the story behind the events was actually quite interesting and complex it quickly became a chore that got in the way of killing enemies, finding clues and treasure, upgrading weapons and removing the evil on each map. There is not a lot of reading involved but, it does frustratingly slow down the game if you are playing it as an FPS. To get the full benefit from the game it needs to be played first and foremost as an adventure and not an FPS.  The graphics are good, if your eyes are comfortable with the black and white default it heightens the atmosphere also, the night brought on by ringing the bells is particularly atmospheric, I preferred 50% colour during the day which for me, made the day night transition more dramatic. Sound also plays an important part in the game as locating an item, enemy or event can be done just by following a sound to its source, headphones are probably an advantage. Although there is a compass it is not possible mark any locations on the in game maps this can be a problem as some items can only be accessed with a shovel and relocating them once you have found a shovel can be very time consuming. The ability to be able to print out maps for the player to mark locations currently inaccessible of items for later return would have been useful. The game has little if any replay value except for playing on more difficult settings however, I shall play it again when I get time as an adventure and concentrate on following the story, although I completed it only a few hours ago apart from the main character I recall very little of the interrelationships of the other dozen or so characters in the story. I bought this in a sale and believe that I got value for what I paid however, I also believe there was a lot of potential missed because the two main game play genres failed to complement each other effectively, despite that, it was still an enjoyable game. I shall definitely consider any future offerings from Black Powder Games. ",

            "review_text": "While initially enamoured by the world of  Betrayer , with it’s stunning art style and intriguing plot, my interest quickly waned when the shallowness of the gameplay became apparent. This didn’t stop me enjoying it, mind.  The game is set on an unnamed island in the year 1604, which has been taken over by “corrupted Conquistadors”, as well as various other nasties. You quickly meet a girl, whose name is unknown to both of you, who claims she has been trapped on the island for quite some time. She warns you about the dangers within, but obviously, if I were to turn back towards the sea, that wouldn’t be very interesting. So, ♥♥♥♥ you red-hooded lady, I’m staying.  The game reminds me of what little I’ve heard about  Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture , insofar as that everyone on the island has ♥♥♥♥ed off somewhere, leaving only ghostly remains who serve little more than to tell you what went on. The game injects very little personality into these beings, resulting in me quickly switching off to what was being said (or, read, because there is no voice acting) and just skipping dialogue.  However, the game’s combat features quite an interesting mechanic. There is a pseudo stealth system in place, meaning you are able to silently take out enemies from a distance when a gust of wind blows. Being set in grassy fields and forests, this makes perfect sense given that for the most part you will be killing enemies with a bow, although you can also get your hands on a crossbow, musket and pistol. The last two are, needless to say, quite loud, and will not mask your approach. The wind sound effect is also very nice, might I add.  The enemies themselves aren’t too bright. They will run at you until they are within their preset range to be able to attack you, meaning that you can easily kite them until you’ve twatted enough arrows into them to have them fall down. The game also features a “dark world” mechanic, wherein you ring a bell and ♥♥♥♥ goes all dark. In this dark world, among other changes, the standard enemies are replaced by spooky, scary skeletons, which send shivers down your spine. Mechanically, they are not much different to the Conquistadors, and less visually striking.  Speaking of visuals, the game has a stunning art style. In fact, it has multiple art styles. By default, the game is high contrast duotone, apart from reds (yes, like  Sin City ). Is there a name for that art style? Maybe. Anyway, if you don’t like that style, then you are very similar to me. However, you are in fact able to change it in the settings, with separate sliders for contrast, saturation and brightness. The only other game I can think of that lets you do that is  Serious Sam 3  and  Skyrim  with mods. More games need this feature, it’s a great customisation option. I highly recommend you enable full colour in this game, it looks fantastic with it.  The game mainly consists of collecting bits of paper with words on them, finding tombstones with words on them and treasure chests with all sorts in them. Also some story happens which ends abruptly (I think?) when you’ve done enough stuff that the red hooded girl remembers her name. Then that’s sort of it. You wander off and carry on collecting. No real climax, no credits, no cutscene. Nada. This didn’t bother me much, but did leave me a tad perplexed. Perhaps there’s an Arkahm-esque special super ending for collecting all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the game. I might find that out, one day.  So, yeah, the game is about a man on an island with a girl, and you find stuff and there’s exposition in there somewhere. It’s all a bit aimless, but the nice looking environments and collectathon nature of things was actually enough to keep me interested.",

Once you start to get a feel for the core gameplay and the overall style of teh game however, it becomes very enjoyable and a unique experience that feels a bit more a bit more fleshed out and polished than what I was expecting of an indie title like this.  By no means is this game for everyone, I could understand people not 'getting it' or becoming bored; it does not hold your hand or constantly stimulate you. There are no questmarkers here, only what your two ears can pick up and a slew of revolutionary war era weaponery. Combat is refreshing and challenging while still being fun, slow reloading forces you to think on your feet and use everyting you got.  The visuals are a treat as well, you can adjust the tone/colour as you see fit and the graphics are quite good, the occational breeze that sways all the plantlife is a brilliant touch. The AI is pretty decent too and will try and flank you sometimes, or pop up behind you from the ground.   Also you can give a girl a bunch of dead peoples stuff.",

Then buyed it, after final release, (not the buggy Early Access Version), launched it...and....'that's it? oh, okay'... Anyway, when the game tries to be scary, at least tries to create spooky atmosphere, the result is not that good. Betrayer means a lot of walking in circles, pressing the 'LISTEN ability' button, defeating enemies in boring fights, and walking with a bit of...walking and...running. On EMPTY, BORING MAPS. But this title has some nice features you should check out. Of course the grey scale. And the fact that players can turn this off and play with colors. One also of the good things is a FREAKIN' GOOD audio. You better play with headphones, everybody recommends it! Wind blowing, waving flags, shooting arrows...and the weird noises you hear, when you use the 'LISTEN' ability - it's just a compass to your objectives, (not everything is pointed by this, not the chests with treasures, etc) but following voices is a very nice idea. And another good thing, the strongest for me, is the plot. The main plot and the secondary investigation you will proceed through are very interesting and sometimes very terrible. Game worth checking out, but wait for a sale. Price is too high for someting that average.  + Very strong main plot + Stunning audio + Gray scale and ability to turn colors back  - Boring maps.

            "review_text": "Betrayer is an excellent game and reminds me a lot of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games (if they were made by an indie company). It has the same slow, tense atmosphere and requires you to think about each enemy encounter, instead of rushing in weapons blazing. Enemies do a lot of damage and your healing item is minimal for most of the game, so you have to attack from a distance or sneak in an backstab a couple enemies first. The variety of weapons is really useful for multiple playstyles: muskets. pistols, and explosives do more damage, and help you survive when you accidentally attract the attention of a mob, and your knife, bows, and tomahawk are *mostly* silent and help you get stealth kills.   The black, white, and red aesthetic was actually really engaging and improved immersion for me, but don't worry, there is a really simple option to play it in full color if that's not your thing. What's even more interesting about the atmosphere in this game is that it incorporates a Silent Hill-esque mechanic of dark and light 'worlds' that have different enemies and quests.  The storyline is fairly good, but I wouldn't say it is amazing. The theme of 'betrayal' (I see what you did there Blackpowder Games) is consistent throughout the game and there are many smaller stories interwoven into the primary narrative, however, after the first two maps, whenever I spoke to a character that had a quest for me, I could already predict what evil 'twist' would occur in his/her paricular story. Furthermore, I feel that the player-character really doesn't have much motivation at all and ffter playing it all the way through, I don't even know why he's there! All that being said, the story is genuingely creepy and 'messed up.'  I only have a few criticisms for this game. The first is how repetitive it gets right before the end: the enemies don't really change much, so while combat is still fun, it's the same kind of fun, over and over. Even if the frequency of enemies increased, or if the types of enemies were mixed together in close proximity this would present new challenges. Ideally, I would have like to see three more enemy types: 2 for the 'dark world' and 1 for the 'light world,' but I realize that this is an indie title, and there's onyl so much you can do. Also, there is a certain item that let's you dig up these rock piles you find throughout the game, and these piles have some of the best weapons in the game. Unfortunately, by the time you get these awesome weapons, you are near the end, so your need for them is really minimal. It would be nice to get this item halfway through the game. Finally, finding treasure chests and items is really tedious. You simply march out into the forest, wandering aimlessly, until you hear treasure (treasure chests emit a whistling sound). The problem is, you can literally wander around for an hour on one map to find all of the items! Something as simple as a mark on the map when you find a treasure would have made it go quicker, so I don't backtrack to places I've already searched.   All that being said, this game is still chock full of crazy, tense, scary, challenging, shooting, stabbing, sniping, sneaking fun! Get it now!",

While I thought this would be a fun game it was far from it for me and felt more like a chore. The main character is a blank slate who gets practically no development throughout the entire game whatsoever. The black and white and red color scheme is nice for about five minutes then it gets annoying, luckily you can change the color settings in one of the menus. The game for me ran at a solid 15 frames per second the entire playthrough, im not sure if its the game or my machine so i will give it the benefit of the doubt. The main characters task is to go around as mundane exorcist Sherlock Homes who help wraiths come to terms with the horrible murder/♥♥♥♥/suicide they or a loved one committed. excluding the wraiths the only other interactable npc is little red riding hood who appartently has amnesia and a twin sister. The interactions with her are very bare bones and seem absolutely pointless as the game seems more focused on her than you. There is no music or dialogue/speech sounds in the entire game making things feel unfinished, it does add to the creepy factor though. I will admit the game did catch me off gaurd with a few creepy/scary moments. One thing i did enjoy was the introduction of new enemies for the first three stages which helped spice things up, but then things became stale again. There is major repitition in each level involving finding ghosts and objects then using said objects to trigger the memories of the ghosts so that they can forgive themsevles for murdering their friends/loved ones. You do this for every area over and over again, rinse and repeat. By the time you get to the last stage it was my wits end over the difficulty and frustration in the last fight. To top it all off the ending leaves you feeling betrayed and almost robbed of your time playing through this game. I wasnt able to see how great of a game this is but if you are still dead set on buying it I would recommend buying it during a steam sale or humble bundle as I do not think it is worth the full price.",

            "review_text": "Betrayer is one of the most unique FPSs I have played in the last couple of years. It is an unsettling adventure with lots of tragic stories to uncover and I thoroughly enjoyed playing through it.  By just looking at the gameplay videos, you can tell that the game is very heavy on atmosphere. The world has an eerie feeling to it and from the very beginning you know that something went very wrong here. The first time you are transported to the shadow realm, I guarantee some nerve-racking moments. Betrayer's setting is great because while you might not find many enemies, the tension is always kept very high. It is horror done right, not with cheap jumpscares but an atmosphere that is undoubtely chilling.  It also doesn't help that your weapons are true to the game's 17th century setting. If you thought that evading screaming skeletons and floating skulls wasn't enough, then imagine frantically reloading your muskets and pistols that use gunpowder.  The game does not hold your hand along the way and this is a very positive aspect in the age of dumbed-down game design. There is no objective marker, just a 'listen' button that vagely gives you an audio cue about where to go next. This greatly helps immersion and you truly feel like a helpless chap among mysteries and monsters.  Overall, I can easily recommend Betrayer to people who enjoy a refreshing, immersive experience in a unique setting. I really hope that the developers will continue this story with an expansion at least and this is a very rare thing for me to say! ",

In fact they are terrible. Perhaps the biggest problem is the lack of music, not to mention the lame enemy, and the non-existing conversation voices. Thats not why i like it. Rather because of the engaging story, witnessing the life and deciding the fate of the dead people at the land of endless horrors makes the whole event so personal.  The game is good overall, achievements are working, and the Dev crew is so nice and helpful, despite of that, it is not yet recommended to buy before sale.",

There isn't really many RPG elements so I wouldn't go in expecting such, but it is still a compelling little story type game. It is set in a world with two variations, light and dark, during colonial times. The backstory and messages scattered across the map are in no way dull and do not detract from the main story like in some games and the main storyline seems interesting enough.   The only issues I currently have with the game are the enemies with their extreme ranged accuracy, enemies having really wide detection ranges, no voice acting whatsoever (which is okay still), and not much in terms of customization of anything (which is also okay because it seems like more of a story game anyways).  It does a lot of things well though, such as the animations, the sounds, the graphics, and just the individual character of the game. I would say it is worth picking up because it really does have an interesting style that will keep you occupied for awhile.   7.8/10",

However, there is a color saturation option if you want it, but I recommend keeping it off or very very low for the experience intended. The game's atmosphere is relied heavily upon the sound that I had become scared and jumpy on several occasions. There is an item in the game you need to help you find your path via sound. The path-finding sound is like a bunch of whispers that are heard from afar and are louder as you near it. It is audible when the item is used, but i shudder before I even press the button.  The games graphics are beautiful, thought some may say dated. I love the way the trees and grass move and the ambient lighting bounces off the environment. Sprite/Enemy models look a bit shoddy, but does not stray from the fear factor it gives me with animalistic sounds of beastly vehemency. I have fled a few times while whimpering.

The system to find interesting stuff by 'listening' is really well done - a lot of information is conveyed via sound.  One other point is that the system gets a tad repetetive after the first few levels. The game is split into a number of pretty big areas but there is always only one next area to go to. There is also fast-travelling which helps a lot. All in all i'd say the game could use a few tweaks but its pretty amazing - and the price is fair for about 8 hours of gameplay",

            "review_text": "Betrayer is full of betrayals (as one might expect), most of which are discovered in the course of playing through this intriguingly visual mystery first person adventure stealth shooter all the way to the end.   You awaken, shipwrecked on the shore of pre-colonial North America, the world around you rendered in vivid black and white with bare highlights of red. This art design decision works well to frame the story, but also describes the almost exclusively binary decisions you'll have to make in the game. You can change the visual settings if you wish, but I recommend playing at least once with the original settings.  Walking to the British colony to which you were traveling, you'll encounter hostile Spanish troops, and maybe catch a fleeting glimpse of the local natives who reportedly still populate this quiet land. There are also, other... things. Guttural sounds, glimpses through the underbrush. Something here is displeased at your presence. Best to keep moving.  Overall, the story is fairly muted within the gameplay. You can have frequent conversations with game characters, who offer cryptic clues to the story. Combat with the limited period weaponry is the same throughout the game, although you can find/buy better versions. A few useful items you discover allow you to sense things others cannot, almost mystically.  A HUD compass at the top middle of the screen shows your heading and any discovered locations in the current region. You can use a map to fast travel among them as well. This is very helpful as the game regions are all open and explorable. Many additional details can be found if you explore outside the beaten paths.  The sound design is excellent, as it must be since a crucial game mechanic relies on listening. To find clues, stop and use the “listen” key (once you've acquired the item that let's you hear things that others cannot).  When you “listen”, if there is anything to be heard, you'll hear a low sound from the direction of undiscovered items. On the compass' right and left edges will appear guides indicating if the sound is stronger from your right or from your left. It will make sense when you use it.  It can be easy to lose track of your purpose, but these are three things you should remember:  1 - Your journal is pretty thorough. Check it frequently.  2 - You can “listen” for locations of characters and hidden objects. This is crucial to resolving the story.  3 - You can ring the village bell to move from the daylight world to a world of twilight, each world having its own clues and mysteries, most of which all tie well together in the end.  The game's pace is deliberately slow and combat is infrequent unless you're careless. When you hear the howl of an enemy who has just discovered you, there are a few frantic moments as you look around trying to see from which direction the threat is approaching.   But that's about the height of “excitement” in this wonderfully atmospheric game. I took a chance on this game because it offered a fresh look, and it makes for an enjoyable few hours to pull the story bits together until the final betrayal. I'm glad I did as it's well worth trying.",

It runs incredibly smoothly considering I'm not even supposed to be able to run it.   0.5 hrs played  I awoke on a beach; my ship had been caught in some crags. I watch another ship skirt the edge and sail away. I loot the beach and find a note, warning me to turn back, lest I be trapped on the island too.  Another note from a merchant; I am both sentimentally and financially significant to him, thus, he gives me a bow and arrows - allows me to take of his goods, trusting that I'll leave the correct compensation (no doubt strictly a plot device to reinforce isolation (absence of merchant); there is no option to steal).  Come across what seems to be a conquistador. My first arrow ricochets off his helmet. My second finds purchase in a chink in the trunk (torso). Grab his pistol and move on to a Fort.   Explore the area with the color saturation at 0.1. Come across another conquistador; he takes a third of my health 'fore I dispatch him.   Continue, crouching all the while, only sprinting when the wind blows, so as to muffle my steps to any other adversaries.  Neglect the Fort for the countryside; I find a note presumably from one of the men stationed in the fort: He expresses concern at his superior's wanting to confiscate and hide treasure amongst the hills and fields.   Another foe put down with one arrow to the neck. Jump atop a rock, to witness a panorama; flashing indicates loot to either side, red indicates enemy before me off in the distance. Unsure of how to consider gravity and whatnot, I move closer... though not enough; arrow seems to have nearly grazed his head. Second arrow either connects or does graze; his rage makes the distance 'tween him and myself seem a few meters.  We exchange; I take cover behind my rock to reload. I try out the different weapons (bow, pistol and a rifle I had picked up). Connect with the pistol (on the second shot); rifle seems to have a spread. I peek over, with an arrow notched. I get a face-full of pellets.    This game... is awesome.  The visuals, the environment(al features), the ambience.  The combat: No medium; painstaking stealth, oddly hectic firefights with flintlock and powder based firearms.  The story: From what little I know, you can shift between two realms.

The graphics eventually become a strain on the eyes, as you try to squint and find a flash of red in the repetative black and white landscape (which can be confusing, as the enemies are usually red, but so are certain small plants/flowers). The soundtrack becomes dull, as all you hear is the sound of the wind and the odd growl from the monsters roaming the map. The combat is repetative and boring, widly going from one-shot easy kills to mobs that kill you in a few hits. The weapons are limited to bow, crossbow, pistol, musket, rifle and melee (with sub-weapons like tomahawk and bomb), but are very clunky to use (rotating between them should be smooth, but turns out awkward and sometimes doesn't work at all) and the variety within said weapons is small. The gameplay gets boring, very fast.  The setting gets dull as you notice there is very little difference between the zones. Trees, long grass, and the odd small fort/camp. The stealth mechanic is pretty bad, as you are caught between walking (the enemies see you easily), running (the enemies see you very easily) and sneaking (the enemies shouldn't see you, but mostly do unless you're at a far distance).

            "review_text": " Fantastic atmosphere in more ways than just its striking visuals.   Betrayer was quick to draw me into its world. It is a world that manages to feel, at the same time, both desolate and packed with intrigue. There are places to explore, mysteries to solve and threats looming around every bend. This is a game that isn't afraid to take some risks in terms of game design. The results are sometimes wonderfully successful and other times ineffective.  What first drew me to Betrayer was its artistic design. While it does look as good as the screenshots, the novelty of it does wear off over time. I eventually experimented with turning on full color and was pleased with how things looked that way as well. Just know that simply turning up the color saturation slider doesn't make for something pleasing to the eye. You'll have to change the light and dark intensity sliders as well. I had both of them moved most of the way to the left.  As eye catching as the graphics style is, the sound design is equally as good and is an integral part of the experience. Even though the only music is during the main menu and credits, I never felt like the game was missing a soundtrack. All the sounds of the forest and the way you 'listen' for clues and collectables makes your ears as valuable as your eyes as you explore.  Hunting for certain collectables can be a chore due to your long range 'listen' ability being restricted to leading you only to story related locations. That can make for a lot of aimless wandering for completionists like me, which gets frustrating when you're still missing something after going through an area quite thoroughly. This could have easily been remedied by a late game unlock to be able to 'listen' for everything. It also doesn't help that there isn't a lot of variety in environments. In fact, around the halfway point in the game zones start to blend together and no new enemies are introduced either. The final zone is very cool and unique, however. From around 50% to 85% of the way through the game is easily its weakest portion. Contributing to that is that it is around this point that you begin to identify gameplay patterns, making things feel predictable and repetitive.  If you're into murder mysteries then I suspect you'll enjoy Betrayer. Each area you visit has its own stories to tell. Some of these stories offer clues as to what's happened in the larger region in which the game is set. Others simply flesh out the local histories. It is up to you to decipher what fits into the grander scheme of things.",

The game started in my native resolution of 5760x1080 so aside from maxing out the other graphics I didn't have to do anything else, the aspect ratio (100) is good.  The game itself is actually fun and does do a good job of pulling you into the story overall with little notes left around to give you hints of things that transpired before you arrived. I only have less then an hour into it now but it's enough for me to say 'Hmmm, well that's interesting, I think I'll push ahead and learn more', so I'll be putting a lot more time into this.  I did get this at the sale price and if you like games of this nature then this is a MUST buy, if it's at full price then it's up to the buyer, I'd check and see how much actual play time is involved but in any case, even at full price (so far) it looks to be worth it and priced well.

The thing thats really Great is that Betrayer Doesn't Use Many Jump-Scares, Unlike Slender who uses Jump Scares for Cheap Frights this game Makes you Scare or Jump Yourself... Example: I was still pretty fresh to the game just entered the first area and still not knowing much about the enemies. As i Took out a Lone Conquistador i Moved in to Loot the corpse as that happened A Gust of Wind Came by And i turned to see something Shiny, Instantly my Mind Thought that it was onther enemy so i had a mini-Heart attack and Ran. Only to Find out it was only a Piece of loot i failed to pick Up  Clocked in 9 or so Hours since buying it Yesterday and ive got it loaded ready to play When i Finish this... This game is a Visually Striking, Unique, Terryfiying, Beautiful and Immersive games And i Highly Recommend it. The Game looks just as good in colour than it does in Grey Scale, Only the Grey scale makes it that much more atmospheric.  The only little Niggle/Flaw i Have with this game... No Voice acting...

You'll need to get weapons and choose your tactics.  You will die but death isn't a major factor unless you choose the option to leave your belongings at the scene of your death. This means you have to go and recover them before you die again or lose them permanently. Death normally just means you're resurrected and the enemy has respawned, possibly at different locations and you have to try again.

I actually ended up loving it, the lack of any musical presence and the mystery surrounding the whole island was something I enjoyed, if you can, leave the color settings as they are, as it adds to the immersion quite a bit, I would also recommend using a headset, as finding your way is almost entirely reliant on sound.  The game starts out with you waking up on a beach with a crashed ship out in the sea and broken cargo washed up around you, you have no memory of anything, and you start to explore the island, and you see a hooded figure out on a cliff whom sends you a note by shooting it at a totem near you. After this intro, which you have control of the entire time, I was hooked and a little obsessed with finding out who the hooded figure was, and why was there a destroyed ship out ate sea.  The game play is open world, in the first person perspective with a focus on basic shooting mechanics and very light stealth thrown in there. Your weapons consist of bows, crossbows, and muskets as a primary weapons with thrown explosives that explode on contact and hatchets which are thrown directly in front. Your weaponry is obtained either from fallen enemies, hidden chests scattered around the island, dug up from the ground in predetermined digging spots, or purchased via a weapons rack. The health is more classic, with a predetermined amount of health that runs down with every hit taken, it can be replenished by drinking water from barrels, and you do carry around “waterskins” that can heal you when away from a water barrel, these “waterskins” are replenished when you drink from a barrel.  The dialog is entirely text, and often times blunt, still I enjoyed some of the snarky replies I got from one of the characters. The story is kind of scattered at first, with you finding bits and pieces of events everywhere and you trying to connect the dots between all the different characters, but towards the end everything begins to fall into place and you see the wickedness and cruelty of some of the characters, and stupidity and cowardice of others, with some people getting caught in between and becoming victims. Often times you will be confronted with a choice between replies, some of which can have an impact on the story and maybe difficulty of the game.  If you are someone looking for a game with a lot of backstabbing happening in the plot, and want to shoot human and ghost like beings, than this just might be what you are looking for.

            "review_text": "Summary: I have come to a point in my life where I don't find as much enjoyment out of games as I did when I was younger and it has become difficult to play through an entire game and feel excited or compelled to complete it. However, Betrayer is the first game in a long time that has me wanting to play until the end credits. I first became interested in playeing Betrayer when I learned that it was set in older times specifically during the colonization of 'the new world'; this combined with the paranormal elements implemeted into the game make up for a very gripping and unique experience.  Experience: The game delivers a very unsettling and eerie atmosphere through sound, visuals and dark subject matter. It combines history and paranormal elements in a way that works greatly and is actually believable. The game deals with subject matter including murder, betrayal, witchcraft, adultory and other aspects of life during the colonization period. Sounding bells sends you into a ghost demension similar to 'the Further' in the Insidious series where you meet the tormented souls of the previous inhabitants of the forts and villages that you explore; through them you learn more about the colony's dark past and the events that led to the dissapearance of its settlers. The plot gets darker and more sinister as the you progresses through the game.  Gameplay: The compat is a littly clunky, but I feel that this greatly adds to the survival/horror elements in the game. Battles are intense and frantic as a result of the aiming difficulty and long reload times; this forces the player to develop fighting strategies and use stealth effectively in order to stay alive. To me however, exploration and progressing through the story were far more interesting aspects of the game than the combat.  Verdict: Betrayer is definitely a strange game, but in a good way. Its atmosphere and dark historical subject matter are what make this game so unique and unsettling. I would like to point at that you are not forced to play the game in black and white. There is a slider in the settings and pause menu where you can adjust the brightness, darkness, and saturation to your liking. I recommend playing the game in color because you are forced to play in a desaturated screen setting when you enter the ghost demension; you get the best of both 'worlds' this way! See what I did there? Anyway, I would definitely recommend trying the demo if you're not convinced yet; it really gives you a good idea of what the game is like. I also recommend getting this game when it goes on sale for $4.99; You will get more than your money's worth!",

Colonial Virginia would not be the first place I thought of for a horror/action game, but it works extremely well.  3) Haunting characters. You are confused, they are confused, no one knows what the hell happened, but it was all very bad. I enjoyed the slow reveal of the dark story line in this game.  4) Bows and muskets. Really fun weapons to play with. Muskets are very strong...but if you miss that first shot you might have problems.   Didn't Love: 1) Limited interaction with the Indians. They mostly serve as scenery and have little to say about the current hellish nightmare that has enveloped the land.  2) You might have to resort to google to advance certain aspects of the story.  I highly recommend this game and I hope they make a sequel.  ",

            "review_text": "In the beginning, Betrayer was really interesting. It has a pretty unique art style, a fun combat system, realistic locations and dark stories to discover.  But the game tries to be something it isn't. It's not about shooting enemies, it's about investigating. You find ghosts who don't remember their names and their cause of death, so you have to find out what happened by finding other ghosts, clues and objects.  So, for example you find a flute and a shoe. Each one belongs to a different person. You talk to a ghost and you are able to ask him if he knows the flute - he'll say yes and voilà, you know his name. But you can't even ask him if he knows the show because the game only allows you to ask the right questions. Investigation at its best!  Objects, clues and ghosts are scattered all around the map, so you have two options: You either investigate the whole map on your own (everything is marked on the map) or you just let the game show you where to go next. Which is basically unavoidable unless you want a huge pain in the ♥♥♥ because the ghosts and dialogues are triggered and you never really know whom to speak to next. Also, the ghosts are the only thing not marked on the map.  The stories itself are really dark and fit into the historic background, but once you clear one of the maps you just move forward to the next one and forget everything that's been told before.  It's always the same: You enter a map, explore it until you find the bell to enter the 'dark world', let the game lead you through an extremely linear detective story and then enter the next map. It's a shame because the combat system is really good and challenging, but that just isn't enough to keep you excited for about 7 hours. Open world is pointless - the only freedom the game gives you is grinding. Lots of grinding.",

It's easy to figure out, nothing is too taxing and the gameplay ebbs and flows between a parallel dimensional concept. However after a short time I found myself wanting more variables to play with. Where's my stamina bar? Why can't I climb trees? I want more items. More dynamic enemies. My health goes down too fast (I can only imagine they did this to lengthen the game duration as you are forced to regularly go back for health).  Overall the gameplay felt a little mechanical and 2 dimensional, unfinished, yet relaxing, quite enjoyable and hopefully the start of something big.    Game ambiance: 5/10 There isn't really much, but what does have I like. Ambience? What ambience? Well... The grass and the tress bend, sway and dance as the wind blows through on a sunny day. Shhhhh, I'm going to take a nap. ...was that a bird?   Reliability/Stability: 10/10 Reliable. No crashes/problems/errors to report.   Story/Plot: 6/10 Not bad. The plot was never dull for me. I enjoyed it throughout. There were a few elements that were original and some that sounded religiously suspicious. That being said I felt I had to drop the score a few points because, again, the game felt unfinished, or more like a concept than a full release.    Concept: 7/10 Brilliant. It's good to see a bow and arrow and black powder arms game. I love the way you can play with the colour and how colour is part of the game. The quests are great too.   Concept execution: 5/10 Good clean simple fun. I really hope there is a Betrayed 2 and it's literally, in every way, twice the game this is.   Textures: 5/10 Average. Characters look somehow 'plonked' in the there without much visual continuity with scenery textures. Although the shrubs on the ground have nice textures.   Modelling: 6/10 Average, but better than the textures. Weapons look great. Plant leaves are ok.   Graphics: 6/10 Overall they are ok. Despite it's shortcomings the game is by no means intolerable.   Sound: 5/10 weapons are great! As for the rest the game needs a bigger sound library.   Music: 6/10 Menu music is nice.",

The whole look and feel and controls of Betrayer are kind of dated. For example dialog with characters is through point and click txt. Can't really save game progress and although there is autosave - when you get killed (often for a player like me) you return to the fort or whatever and start all over from quite a way back.

The design doesn't make the player's objectives clear enough. This results in too much running backwards and forwards looking for people, items and clues, which gets boring after a while.

It combines elements of horror, mystery, playing detective, and discovery in a 1604 colony establishing itself in Virginia, tied together with a strong narrative. While investigating disappearences and unearthing the fate of the colonists, the player travels across a gorgeously designed world. Think Miasmata style exploration, with the stealth of archery, or the braziness of muskets and pistol combat should the player choose.  The engine runs very well, and looks stunning. The game features a black and white filter, the strength determined by the player, who can choose true greyscale or saturate the colours as vivid or dull as they choose. Certain elements of the world remain red regardless.  The combat is very well done, the weapons are very responsive, and the archery behaves exceptionally well.  Even just exploring the world makes this game the comfy simulator so many people desire.  To top it all off, the writing builds a world of characters so vivid and varied that you'd be hard pressed to stop playing, lest you not know what happens/happened next.  Absolutely recommend this game to anyone looking for a comfy experience, or a middle ages, colonial setting horror or mystery.",

First you go get your first weapon then your introduced to some mystery girl then you're not sure like everything else you encounter if you should trust her or not. Personally this game has kept me on my toes. Stealth is somewhat good, but its very useful when sniping, Combat feels great and you can adjust the game to give you even more of a challenge than what you had before or make it easy so you don't overwhelm yourself too much. Second the game visually is a little abstract. If you play it you can keep the black, white, red look to it how its intended or you can make this game colorful and see how bright and beautiful the world is. It's possible the developers did this for people are color blind or don't like how it looks.   As for its way of making you feel like fight or flight every enemy I encountered I made crucial choice whether to go in charging guns blazing or keep it quiet and make yourself blend in the shadows as the enemies try to find where you are as you pick them off one by one in a nice safe corner. The AI for this game are questionable because they're either very intelligent or ignorant. For example, an enemy ran up to me with a knife then quickly pulled out a gun and shot me dead. As I was charging for him as well. As this happened I laughed because it happened so quick, but the next guy I fought he died just like I did. Ammo is not to be taken lightly every arrow, bolt, or bullet is a blessing when you get some.  This game has alot of unexpected jump scares and travelling feels great.   My only complaints or refutes for this game is although it's a great game things like mapping a quest and finding quest items are like finding a needle in a hay stack. It gives you where you are, but does not have a very good way of showing it if you're lost. While Ranged Combat is great, melee combat is a bit weak. There isn't any voice acting for characters so it's like much older rpg games I've played in the past so you'll just have to do what I do and be a voice actor for fun as the game takes you on adventure one quiet not like it. This game is not for the faint of heart and one that constantly needs direction for story progression because there is one you just have to bear the monsters you encounter and scary moments that await you.   If I had to rate this game it gets a 8/10, but I found myself not playing too often, because for me it was probably because I'm afraid to go back on after what I encountered my last playthrough with friends, but I'm not spoiling anything.",

This game is almost enirely in a black and white hue. Why this is so nice, is because they then use the color red in a very interesting way. A lot of emphasis on the color red. Twisted Spaniards roam the land, and they wear bright silver armor, with red cloth wrapped around it. Bright red. Stuff like that. The story is essentially a big 'Who done it' story. You land on the coast of the newly discovered American shores, and find a town. But it is utterly abandoned. There is one other living person on the island, so it seems. The Maiden in Red, who also knows nothing about herself or her past. The delivery is excellent, forcing you to listen to find new clues and locations...

However, amongst the game's good points, I did find errors. I found that even on the lowest difficulty, the enemies could be outrageously hard when given a moment's chance to gang up on you, which became even more frustrating when the character started to walk backwards and to the side by itself. This made aiming at things and not dying almost impossible during certain sections of the game, especially toward the end. I don't know how many have suffered this issue, but beware of it before buying in case it happens to you too. Lots of rage was had.  I also found parts of the game to be really boring. There's tons of running back and forth, and even when there isn't, there's tons of fast-travelling back and forth instead. I love it when video games feature fast travel, because it allows me to explore more, make sure I've found collectibles etc, but when the story heavily rests on using the feature, it becomes boring and stale, especially between environments that, as pretty as they are, look immensely similar.  All in all I enjoyed the game. A lot of it looked rather appealing, the controls are easy to get to grips with, the controller support is generally good and the story was genuinely rivetting from time to time. A bit glitchy here and there and a tad frustrating too, but I recommend playing this anyway. Probably for fans of FPS games in general. 6/10.",

This might be my favorite thing here - you don't just work out the story, you also have to work out how you go about to make things happen.  The writing is excellent, it looks gorgeous, and the gameplay is pretty unique. It's a bit obtuse, but by design; a hugely rewarding game if you decide to stick with it.",

Game isn't very long but will occupy a good 6-8 hours if you take the time to read the dialogue and do the side investigations. The combat is very basic. Look at enemy and either shoot it with an arrow or musket ball or slash at it with your knife. There are stealth mechanics but it's only helpful some of the time. You find charms which act as modifiers for your weapons and melee but for the most part they seem to have been a feature that felt like it was quickly added versus being well though out as you can get some hefty bonuses from them later in the game.   The story is interesting but strewn about the game world so if you don't take the time to dig up every hole and open every chest and talk to every NPC then you will end up leaving this game lost and confused. There is some back tracking but it's not terrible and for the most part if you can get this game on sale or from a bundle then it is worth taking the day to play it.   The game itself has some 'funny' sound effects and it won't win any awards there but the world itself is beautiful. The areas could have been created a little better by possibly adding some wildlife or more interactable objects but the base game is fine the way it is. You are supposed to feel alone in a hostile world where everything wants to kill you, afterall. It does seem a bit odd though to hear birds chirping and crows screeching but to not actually see any flying or wandering around on the forest floor scrapping for food and what not but it isn't exactly going to hurt the game any by not seeing them.   Overall the game was a wonderful experience and maybe with time there will be some DLC or a sequel that will utilize the base game's features and world to create a successful sequel.",

Striking and vibrant art style, glorious sound design, weapons feel good to use, enemies aren't very varied but are quite smart and fun to fight. The story's VERY interesting (and quite bleak), and told through nice and twisty writing. Genuinely heartbreaking at times.  On the obligatory flipside, the game felt a wee too short, the map's TOO useful (every single item is marked on the map, so exploration quickly gave way to just hopping between markers), the areas felt a little too similar after a while and the 'kill x enemies' achievements felt like overblown grinding, as I fought A LOT and still wasn't even halfway to the required kill count by the end of the game. Not enough to dissuage me from recommending it, though.  Strongly recommended.",

It's not very well fleshed out in general, to be honest. But it is very, very compelling where it's at its strongest.  Betrayer is noticeably repetitive and doesn't have many engaging mechanics, and the ending is considered puzzling, cliffhanger or even lackluster by many. But its creepy, atmospheric setting, striking presentation(which you can fine-tune to your liking!) and brilliant sound design more than make up for its flaws. All exposition is provided via text, however, and there is little environmental storytelling. It tries to be an semi-open-world RPG, but to be honest it's much closer to a fetch-quest driven FPS with RPG elements.  It's an atmosperic, immersive story of how flawed humans are. Overall, this game is kinda closer to its artsy-fartsy kin, rather than to mechanichally competent products. In my opinion, it's well worth the asking price, and if you're into this kind of janky creepiness - go ahead and try it.",
