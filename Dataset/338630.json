            "review_text": "This is an awesome game! When I first opened the game, I thought it would only be about healing animals. Which, most games like this are. But no, you get to care for the animals (feeding, watering, petting, grooming, and cleaning hooves if applicable) and you also have to train them! Once you trained them all the tricks possible (you have to unlock them all, first) you can release them to either the Savannah, the Songutu Forest, or the Kingo Swamp based on where the animal lives. I recently found out that you can name the animals and even dress them up or give them 'haircuts'. Wildlife Camp is more in depth than I thought it would be. I'd give it a 10/10! I totally recommend this, the game is way underpriced and it should be worth about $20! If you love animals and/or you would love to be a veterinarian and an animal caretaker, Wildlife Camp won't disappoint you!",
