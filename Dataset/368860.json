    "description": "Garbage Day is an open world sandbox game, in which you are stuck in a time loop (meaning you live the same day over and over). In this game you have to explore and interact to find out how to get out of the time loop. You are open to do anything you want, kill innocent people, go to work, watch tv, go to the park, etc.",
