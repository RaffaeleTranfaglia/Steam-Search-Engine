DotEmu should have let MOSS or Seibu Kaihatsu program it (and not just license it). Because Seibu did The Raiden Project, and they did amazing on that compilation. So for f*** sake's, let them program it! Or at least make MOSS program it.  Stick to the mobile version. It's much more superior. Or better yet, stick to MAME.",
