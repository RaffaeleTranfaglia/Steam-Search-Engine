            "review_text": "I finished the whole thing and all of its thirty-ish levels in one day because it was that fun. I'm exhausted.  Hexcells is a logic puzzle that's similar to other number games like Minesweeper and Picross, as you use processes of elimination and deduction to fill in patterns of tiles. The distinction here is that since the tiles are hexagons, they're not restricted by square grids, and most puzzles look like abstract shapes or very loosely defined objects. Black-background hexes have numbers on them from 0-6, indicating how many of the gold tiles around them can be clicked to turn blue, which counts toward stage completion.  Those hexes are a mixed blessing--finding all of them is the whole point of the game (though you do have to mark every single tile, whether you believe it to be a blue 'hit' or a black 'guide'), but unless you know how many blue tiles are in a given area, these don't often give any information on the tiles around them. The numbers themselves eventually adopt additional characteristics that give you more information on how to complete a stage, but it's well worth remembering that making a decision about one tile necessarily is effectively making a decision about all of the tiles next to it as well. Levels are divided up into groups and sometimes able to be completed out of order, and completing each level perfectly will often mean you unlock the next set even without fully having to finish the previous one.  The game is easy to learn, with simple controls and all of the rules explained as you need them, and there are no hectic time limits to worry about. (I don't know if there's a way to save during levels.) You'll probably build up enough stress just by trying to finish levels without making mistakes, as difficulty ramps up quickly and there's no quick way to restart stages, that I know of, without exiting back out to the level-select menu. This may serve the purpose of discouraging cheating, though. It would be nice to be able to turn the music on and off during a level, but the little 'bloop' sounds the tiles make when clicked go really well with the gentle soundtrack, so much so that you might not notice them at first.  You can make guesses about what tiles are where, but it's much more satisfying to finish a stage or even a small section of one because you understood the rules than because you happened to get lucky. The game doesn't need reflexes, but it expects and encourages patience and discipline (try not to scream if you misclick toward the end of a level you've been chipping away at for half an hour), all for the cost of a small meal.",

Most importantly with a little bit (and sometimes with  a lot ) of thinking you can figure out where each blue cell is located. Unlike minesweeper where sooner or later you come to a point when you have to close your eyes and guess randomly.   Music is very nice and the game itself is relaxing.   The first game is short and puzzles are easy to crack. It took me ~3 hours to perfect all 36 levels. It helps to learn mechanics of the game but it won’t last long.

            "review_text": "A modern classic of a puzzle game let down only by short length, and lack of a level generator or level editor/workshop support. A fantastic advertisement for Hexcells Plus, and Matthew Brown's games in general.  When this started, I was thinking (as apparently everyone else does) 'updated Minesweeper, with better music and graphics.'  As more gameplay mechanics were introduced, I stopped thinking about minesweeper - this is something mch, much more intelligent and much, much more involving. It's still a game where you're deducing the position of tiles that should be left-clicked and ones that should be right-clicked, but the ways you determine which are which change as the game progresses, allowing for some intricate and elegant puzzle solving.  The new gameplay elements represent both a challenge and a tool, meaning the game feels incredibly well-balanced - you're unlikely to ever throw your hands up because something became too complicated. Rules are added as if the entire game were a complete tutorial, to the point that in the later stages, you notice the position of something at a different angle to before, and you instantly understand what this means.  All new rules are introduced with a mini-tutorial puzzle so you get the chance to try them out on the small stage before moving on to a larger-scale puzzle. You can restart and replay levels, which is great if you're like me and have the kind of fingers that left-click when you wanted them to right-click. I think I had one level where I made the same one mistake 5 times, just through being cackhanded... and it's not like I've never played any Portal game, so the blame is squarely at my feet for any frustration I experienced there. That's a nice thing about this puzzle game - it's very friendly, very calming. I complained only at myself (for having stupid fingers, or for making a dumb move), never, ever at the game.  The game looks beautiful - cool colors, minimalist layout - my only gripe is that the menu text looked a bit washed out on my screen - it took a while to be able to see the 'Quit' text - for example - and the music is excellent, accompanied by ambient chimes that play in tune with the music - if you wanted to you could turn the solving of a level into a pretty pleasing musical performance with a little practice.  Achievements are slightly bugged, in that you'll only get them (or at least I only did) the next time you start the game and continue your last save slot. And that's where the game has its biggest letdown - as I understand it, it only has 6 worlds. Not getting the achievements the first time through, made me think that perhaps each world was made up of 6 sets of puzzles, and that the numbers on the homescreen represented the first 3 worlds. Not so. I've unlocked the final world just now, and my game is registering around 2.2 hours played - and that includes leaving the game running for at least half an hour while I did something else.  There's probably 2 hours of gameplay for most people in this, which you may feel is not enough to justify whatever price is being charged. I got this via the Bundlestars Indie Capsule 2, so at most it was around $5 (if I ignored all the other games in that bundle), and I feel that was definitely worth the price.   To sum up - Hexcells is a game that seems at once familiar and modern, is challenging without being frustrating, looks good, sounds good, is good value for money, and is a satisfying gameplay experience that leaves you wanting more of the same.   Get it. It is good.",

There are also some interesting new mechanics at play, like seeing the 'mine' count for certain rows or columns, or getting information beyond just a number, like whether all the adjacent mines are touching each other or not. I was VERY pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this, and I'm looking forward to trying out the other Hexcells games soon.  Side note-- the function of the left and right click are swapped from how they are in Minesweeper. If you have played a decent amount of Minesweeper, do yourself a huge favor and swap the Hexcells controls before you start playing. I didn't, and it screwed with me more than I'd care to admit.",

The difference are that few levels of Hexcell aren't randomly generated and more complex mechanics are introduced as you go on.   The first problem I have with this game is that it does not let you fail. Rather than failing a level for hitting a 'mine', it only count your mistake. It sound like a good thing, but it simply inadvertently spoils the game. I admit that I don't know what could be done to fix this, but nevertheless its the equivalent to trying to solve a math problem with the answer in front of you. You might do your best not to look, you still end up figuring something that you wouldn't have normally.  The second problem is related to the few inconsistencies of the game. It's a minor issue, but sometimes, it seems that the game take liberties with its own rules (or simply doesn't set them). For example;  Two mines in a row of four tiles are said to be next to each other? Turn out that 'next to each other' still count when the row is separated by a huge white space.   symbols like '--' indicate that mines aren't next to each other? It only mean that at least one mine is not connected to the others.  etc.  Like a said, this is a minor issue, but combined with a very short unpunishing game, it doesn't leave you anything worthwhile. I can't recommend this game when other interesting puzzle games are available for the same price.",

            "review_text": "It IS an abstract puzzle, like minesweeper or sudoku or something like that, and it has a nice atmospheric sound and visuals to go along with it, but that's all it really is, honestly. It feels really insubstantial. Simply adding more levels isn't what I want, either. Nor is adding more mechanics. I just think it's hard to make an abstract puzzle game feel as fun as some of the other games out there. It took me 2-3 hours to 100% and I didn't really end it feeling like I was glad I played it.   Plus, the music loop starts to get annoying after awhile. It's too short, plays too often, and isn't mixed in with other tracks.   And the core gameplay loop is pretty much just - reveal the obvious stuff, then hunt around for the next thing you can reveal. That's not that fun to me compared to what you do in other games. It's not the lack of action or anything - I'm fine with slow-paced, turn-based, or other puzzle games. It's just the lack of problem solving - this game is all deduction and very little intuition. I like working with and experimenting with a hard problem and going over it in my head and trying different avenues of solutions and trying to come up with observations and rules and constraints that I can use to simplify the problem. You can find that core gameplay loop in lots of excellent puzzle games, but you won't find it here.  If you like minesweeper or sudoku you should definitely give this a try. Otherwise, even if you're a huge fan of puzzle games like me, I'd probably avoid this. You're not going to find that problem-solving engagement and stimulation here, unlike what you'd find in lots of other puzzle games. There's no experimenting, discovery, or anything like that. It's just 'oh here's the next spot for which I can prove its contents' and 'hmm, where's the next one?'.  As a counterexample, an abstract puzzle game I DID enjoy was Splice (you might argue that it's not TRULY abstract since it uses a sort of biological metaphor, but I think of it as one). That game has plenty of that 'problem solving high' you get as you experiment and observe and work through a complex problem.",

I had ideas for years on how to improve Minesweeper to make it less punishing and more fun for casual players. You managed to improve on every aspect of this really frustrating classic. You stole my ideas ;(  Everbody who has any fleeting interest in Minesweeper like games, should play this. It's perfect for what it is:   Elegant, easy to get into, but not that hard to master and the best aspect is there is no randomness. If you mess up, it's totally your own fault. There are no frustrating 50/50 situations in corners like in Minesweeper, where you lose all motivation if you f***** up. You get a small penalty for messing up but it isn't ruining your day like in Minesweeper.  Puzzle Design is also top notch. Especially the difficulty progression is perfect. All gameplay elements are easy to understand and are well implemented into the puzzle design. There are no unfair difficulty spikes. Again, ELEGANT as f***. Heck, my father understood this game from the get-go.  The User Interface is also for a lack of a better word, ELEGANT. Every element is perfectly simple and easy to understand.  The Music is also perfect for this. It's relaxing and helps you to concentrate to solve the puzzles. Nothing fancy but perfectly fitting.  I almost forgot the best aspect: IT'S CHEAP. Even without discounts it's only 2,99. I played it for about 6 hours and it's totally worth it.  TL;DR Hexcells should be the superlative of elegant. It's the best puzzle game ever. Buy and play it. Buy it again for your parents and friends.  Best regards D3adalus  P.S. I forgive you for stealing my ideas. Hexcells is way better than my imaginary game anyways :D",

It may be worth skipping this and going directly to Hexcells Plus. First, if you get easily addicted to logic puzzles, Hexcells Plus will keep you thinking for much, much longer. Second, Hexcells Plus' difficulty ramps up slowly and consistently, never adding more than a few techniques at a time.

The Hexcell games are a series of brilliant crafted puzzles that at first glance may seem like a six-sided minesweeper, but the logic used to solve them is closer to sudoku. As you progress through the levels, you are also introduced to some new mechanics accompained by a tutorial level to make sure that you understand them. Because the puzzles are carefully and wonderfully designed, you never have to guess your next move, but finding it gets hard in the later puzzles. The interface is clean and the sound effects are cool. Hexcells is easy, Hexcells Plus gets harder in the second half and Hexcells Infinite steps back a little at the beginning, but in the end offers the most challenging puzzles. It also comes with a seed-based puzzle generator, adding 999,999,999 additional puzzles (even if they aren't hand crafted, they're still good).

Additionally, it never vexed me by being too difficult or requiring me to know the intricacies of how everything worked (those hidden rules you find after doing a puzzle for a long time).   If there's one thing to note, it's that the 'Perfectionist' achievement does NOT require you to get 0 mistakes on all levels, just to get all of those hexagonal 'points'. This is good, because there's several levels where I got 1 honest mistake and it didn't deduct anything.  The game also punishes random 'spam n' solve' play by making it impossible to unlock later levels without X number of aforementioned hexagonal points. Why you would do that anyway is beyond me.  My only critique of the game is a lack of puzzles with all the elements added. Initially, the game starts off by showing you the base points, then shows you that lines and columns can have numbers too, and then shows you how to toggle everything; and suddenly, you're two-thirds of the way through the puzzles. Just a minor gripe, but getting Hexcells Plus &amp; Infinite solves that problem nicely.",

Brilliant puzzles. Several times I was convinced that a particular puzzle would come down to guessing. I was wrong. There's always a way.  I'm especially impressed with the random puzzle generator in the last game. They're not as ingenius as the hand-crafted ones, but I won't have to wait for that 4th game that will never come. Still haven't run into an unsolvable puzzle.  I nominated this for a Steam Award in the 'makes you think' category. Just reiterating: this is good.",

Yes it is like Minesweeper, but it makes you think and it gets harder as you progress, and I love the fact it keeps track of your mistakes so it isn't just a non thinkling clickfest.  High recommend this game and the other two follow up games.",

This isn't a puzzle game to rush, so much. Once I slowed down and paid attention, it was pretty fun.  It looks pretty and sounds pretty, but the actual gameplay is frustrating. I kept running into situations where the puzzle just wasn't giving me enough information to continue without guessing--which is penalized. This could have been avoided with better level design, but as it is, I was just not having fun.",
