            "review_text": "I say yes, but only to a point.  You play as an amnesiac dinosaur like creature who is terrified and alone in a temple or city in a state of decrepitude.   A simple platformer that never asks for very much in the way of challenging jumps, always lead you on where to go with how the stage is laid out to lean into or highlights with colour, and whose puzzles are never quite as complex as you might originally think they are. It falters a bit in the fact one should always have the 'grab/hug' button pressed down so that when running or jumping you will get where you need to go more often than not, even if you fail to see what you are grabbing onto.   To try and stand out gameplay wise it uses a physics engine. This comes into play as you swing across vines, rocks crumble, water flows, creatures bounce off each other, and you the player picks up and throws balls. While okay, it's competent only and perhaps frustrating in the first few tries to figure it out at different points (a ball that explodes needs to be grabbed carefully). Never does much or asks for much.   Yet, it is still a game I took quite a bit from and enjoyed my team with up to a specific point.   The atmosphere and theme of the game is that of horror. The fear of being alone, of not really understanding what is out there in the darkness, and being dropped down into locations with rarely a reason why or what to do until you get close to the end. For this the creators of the game ask you to play in a dark room and with a good set of headphones and I dare say it accomplishes this task of making the game stand out far more than it would if played brightly and in silence.  To bring this into game play often you can be in the dark, shivering or moaning in fear, where that ball of light is precious for survival. Where if there is no light and you make a mad dash to freedom or follow a chance of survival, you look for the smallest of colours beyond the pitch black in near blind hope.   I however never completed this game despite my thoughts above. For while it does stand out and I recommend at least early on for those seeking good sound and atmosphere examples, I never felt satisfied with the platforming and a change in game play in the second half of the game resulted in great frustration where I had to move a floating ball between obstacles and the mouse controls were simply not helpful and just plain annoying in how simple it was to fail due to the layout, floaty physics used, and 'one touch to anything is a restart of the puzzle'. I completed it mind you, but I simply stopped caring at that point.  Later I saw it would often default to limited time of light available and follow the leader trial and error which without challenging platformer I've never cared for.   I did enjoy it's use of achievements. Rather than 'complete this chapter' or ' jump 10 times in a row' they used a set-up of secrets in the game with the Achievement picture being a small close up picture of where to go to find said secret. I went to locate them simply because I enjoy this type of challenge and a few were clever in their hidden paths.   Simple in most regards, worth trying out for what it attempts to do more than what it accomplishes, and perhaps you will not be as annoyed as I was in Chapter 8 to discover what this game is about and the amusing secrets it has for achievements which I found rather clever.  As part of a bundle, that is to get cheap or as a gift, it's worth trying out. If seeking out a platformer or horror game to really get into or at full price, I say nay.",

            "review_text": "Grimind is the story of a creature lost in a darkened underworld. Without a single memory of his life or his place, the creature must navigate through a series of mysterious caves, strange mechanisms, and horrifying structures. Knowing he must remember to survive, he sets out to illuminate the darkness not just of the scary world around him, but of his very mind. In the immense darkness lurks something even more diabolical than simply not knowing who he is or what he is, for he is hunted. Red eyes and snarling screams echo off the cavern walls and pierce his very soul, shaking him to his core. Fear the dark, find relief in the light, and escaped the closing corners of your mind. Your Grimind.",

            "review_text": "Physics and platforming are fun and well done. Sometimes the grabbing onto things can be glitchy. Basically no story, and the little there is tries to be too existential and vague and it just comes out bleh. The ending is dumb. Biggest problem is there is no direction and the game is too ambiguous in its puzzles. You will be in a giant dark level and there are 5 ways to go and you are somehow supposed to know if you grab that green ball in the top right area and throw it into blue water in the bottom left corner that is how you move on. Tons of times I had to look up how to beat a part and would say to myself' how did they expect you to know it worked like that?'. Sometimes what you are supposed to use looks like part of the background or you have no idea it works and so you shouldn't know you need to use a certain item a certain way with it, without any clues or information leading you to the conclusion. Hate when games do that. But besides puzzles that usually dont make sense the rest of the game is fun. 6.5/10",

            "review_text": "Enjoyable puzzle game that had me hooked until the end. Some slight annoyences along the way. But overal good use of light and ambient sounds to create a mood, although the mood is quite depressing. Not giving too much away, but I would not recommend this game if you already are down in the dumps, as playing this would probably depress your mood even further.  If you are however looking for some interesting puzzles to solve and do not 'live' your game characters that much, this could be worth a play. Be warned though, impatient gamers have been known to rage quit as some puzzles do require some skill to complete.",

As soon as you start the game, the first problem you will notice is the awkward broken English and laughable monologue. Everything about this game is painfully amateurish, the art style is hideous, and the sound effects are repulsive, for example: when you spend too long underwater you start hearing a man gulping water, it's absolutely ludicrous. The art style is not consistent, the backgrounds are stretched and blurry but the most pathetic of all is the grabbing animation which consists of 2 single frames. This guy failed miserably at everything but the level design which is decent for the most part. Avoid at all costs, even if you can get it for free.",
