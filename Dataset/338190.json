            "review_text": "Just Get Through is a procedurally generated precision platformer. This means it is infinitely replayable, unlike other games of this genre, where you finish all levels and that's it. On JGT every time you play is a different experience, and the game never ends! You can't actually beat it, just get far and far with practice. It's infinite.  Your goal is to find the exit of each level. You have a compass to help you, but it doesn't work if you're too far. From time to time you can choose what upgrades you want, like more lives, more TNT (almost everything is destructible), better compass, higher jump, etc.  The entire game has the same environment, but you can use color palettes to make the graphics look different.  All in all, Just Get Through is a great game that you can play over and over, always having fun and trying to beat the better highscores on the leaderboards or making and playing custom levels.",

Dying in this has a real weight to it since you spend a decent amount of time on each run. When you run out of tnt or you blew up your only path to the portal, you get a feeling of failure most other games cannot replicate. The color pallates are a great idea, but they could have been executed better. All in all, this game is definitely one of my favorites and I would seriously reccomend it.",

            "review_text": "Just Get Through is a 2D platformer that has you playing through randomly generated levels until your demise. The goal of each level is to reach a portal to traverse to the next level. Every few levels you are treated to a perk which can be as simple as more lives or extra spawn protection time to not taking damage from your TNT. Which is a rather cool feature since this game features destructible environments and parts of the land will collapse if it has taken enough damage. TNT can be used to simply blast a hole right to the portal and can be used to destroy hazards. It can be very dangerous to use if you don't plan and just destroy the level willy nilly since it is possible to get stuck and end your ruin so a bit of pre-planning is advised.  Visuals are really basic and nothing special. It starts off in black and white but you can find more colors hidden in chests while playing. A cool feature but it would have been much easier to have been able to change colors in game instead of having to quit your current run to change it. Music is neither bad nor good, its just there. There is no story or anything like that, just cool little messages scattered around by the developer. It is definitively the type of game you come for the gameplay and it is pretty good in this game as luck would have it. Every level looks the same only with different layouts and hazard placements. They start off small but the more levels you complete the bigger they become and end up having multiple pathways with dead ends which makes it a lot more fun than just going from point A to point B all the time.   We play as a small slightly chubby guy sporting an Elvis haircut. He is very agile and can jump with ease. We start off with 10 lives and 10 sticks of TNT and are able to regain them by exploring the levels. After a few levels we are able to increase the item limit by choosing a perk. There is no real form of attack other than throwing TNT so most of the time we will just be dodging the hazards. These hazards include spikes popping out of the ground, rigged shotguns, saw blades, swinging guillotines and all matter of other nasty stuff. There are check points thrown about the level but not all of them will benefit you as you may spawn next to a deadly trap or simply much further from the objective then when you started the level so it's not wise to activate each checkpoint you run into. As I've mentioned the levels are randomly generated but they also allow you to create and share levels of your own which adds even more content.  If you are into platformers this is a very good one to try out. It's not something you will likely be playing for hours on end but is a go to kind of game when you have a bit of time to kill. There are times that you may be out of luck if you ran out of TNT and there are rather nasty hazard placements but other than that the random generation works very well. Leaderboards are in the game and are compared by how many levels you gone through before dying though you have the option to disable leaderboards entirely. A very simple game to pick up but it will quickly offer you a great challenge and soon enough you will be dodging shotgun shells and jumping for dear life. Overall I'd say it was a impressive first game by a new studio and would wholeheartedly recommend it.",

In fact, at this price (Steam summer sale 2016 for $0.74), I might just get some copies for my friends.",
