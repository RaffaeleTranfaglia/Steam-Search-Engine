            "review_text": "One More Line is a hypnotic game of survive. The concept is crazy simple; don't hit any objects or veer off the course. The problem is you can't simply steer where you want to go. Your only means of changing direction is to grapple hook onto the direct objects that clutter the track. Once attached to these objects you'll start to spin around them and will continue doing so until you release.  The speed of your ship is what makes this such a challenging game. You only have split seconds to decide if you should attach yourself to an object. The farther away from the object the better as you'll have more time to think and examine any immediate threats. This is a huge problem as one of the easiest ways to fail is to swing smack into a near by object while rotating. Also, if you're too close when you hook on your ship rotates so quickly its basically impossible to tell which direction you'll be heading once you release.   As you continue playing though the game you'll unlock different options to customize your experience. You can choose different outfits for your character and different tracks for the contrails of your ship. These choices aren't very thrilling but they at least provide an excuse to continue playing. Then if the challenge of beating your high-score isn't enough to keep you entertained there is an option for local multiplayer which can go up to four players. A series of different game modes offer quite a bit of variety for multiplayer. This is a very fast paced and unpredictable game the would be perfect for parties or a good laugh at a competitive get to together.  The sound design is where this game really shines. The music is thrilling, it keeps you pumped up and ready to face the crazy trials this game will put you through. Death is so quick and is written off almost instantly. Simply click the retry button and you thrown straight back into the world. Meanwhile the game cheers you on in its rhythmic robot voice singing out 'retry' or 'one more line'. This feels kind of reminiscent of Minecraft's 'just one more block' mentality.  There is no doubt that this is a super light game. That being said One More Line is quite fun and very addicting. Most rounds won't even last half a minute. I almost wish the ships speed would have started out slower and got faster as you progressed upwards. My main complaint is there is little to no time to react and stop yourself from swinging right into another object. Also there are times when I'm certain I press the grapple button a fair distance away to find myself slamming right into the object. Its not perfect by any means but its an inexpensive game with a amusingly simple mechanic.",
