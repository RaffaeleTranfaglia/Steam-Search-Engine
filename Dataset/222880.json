            "review_text": "I decided to hold off on writing a review until there were a few more updates and for me to have at least 500+ hours invested into the game. I am going to keep this straight up what i think about it as a whole with no fluff. Short and sweet.  Should you get it? It depends on what type of fps's you like. Many CS players have fell in love with it because they like the realism and they've grown tired of the arcade feel that most other shooters have. Don't doubt it for a second, this game is hard to pick up on but once you do, you realize how well reflexes really help if you're rushing but don't expect to be 360 no-scoping people because there is almost no chance in hell that that will happen. Those with good aim that are looking down sight as you turn a corner will get you every time so this is a game best played instinctively and safe (just don't be one of those snipers that sit at spawn and let the enemy capture everything). There are few grenade, C4, or launcher spots that few people know of and use at the start of some maps which can be frustrating, so that is why I'm really hoping that much larger maps will be released in the future that are more open and don't feel as constrained/guided (Heights and Buhriz are like that but i still love them). Maps that were easy to spawn camp have been updated heavily to prevent that which is great. The devs are absolutely brilliant at balancing and opening new areas of maps, always on top of it so kudos to them.   Community engagement is stronger than i've ever seen it, there was a public playtest of player submitted maps that were voted on in hopes of them being added to the game and the rise of The Digital Gaming League is starting their first official Insurgency competitive season with a multitude of teams signed up.   The Nightfall update just added so much more to the game, it feels totally different than it used to in every good way possible. Noises are made when crossing though brush and leaning, leaning mechanic feels more 'stiff' (meaning not fluidly unnatural), the night vision is spot on and well-balanced, flares look awesome in the night sky, but my only complaint is that the running animations with weapons look kinda wonky now, i preffered it the way it was before but i won't nit-pick things for the sake of the length of this review. Also the new co-op survival is an amazing idea, i could see myself spending hours on that alone with friends.   I could write a list of 10,000 reasons to get this game but none of that could possibly describe the feeling that it would give you if you were playing it yourself. It needs to be experienced, the feelings it gives never dies and that in itself says something. Kills are rewarding, objectives are highly valued, teamwork is vital. You need this game in your life if you are looking for a realistic shooter!  *12/20/14 edited formatting*  NEW UPDATE! 5/3/16  1,290 hours logged, i just can't seem to get enough. New maps, improvements, feautures, etc. OH and a new Insurgency game is coming out soon hell yea! Community is growing steadily, a lot more Pick Up Games (PUG's) than there used to be when i wrote this review for those interested in competitive. My only wish is for ranked competitive matchmaking to exist instead of the typical unranked. The future of Insurgency is looking very healthy!",

            "review_text": "TL;DR: Rainbow Six + Red Orchestra + a bit of Counter-Strike and a sprinkle of attachments like Battlefield but without dumb unlocks. A solid tactical shooter with a slow pace and punishing time-to-kill where a few bullets will take you down.   Insurgency is Rainbow Six in Iraq with lots of sudden death and PTSD and jumping because you're shot out of nowhere. It's a game of hide-and-seek with laser sights betraying their owner's position and footsteps betraying your own position. Imagine if Red Orchestra had a baby with Rainbow Six. It's got a lot of that in its blood. In fact, one of the original devs for RO is the guy behind Insurgency. Now, the hypothetical RainbowOrchestra child was raised by Counter-Strike. Some round-based game modes and not all of them have respawns without some major coordination.   It's a tense package where you might go with no kills or a lot, depending on how well you can plan ahead with your teammates because if you don't get the drop on your enemies, you're dead before the bullets leave the chamber. If you liked the mod, you'll like this. If you like Red Orch but in the scale of the older Rainbow Six games, you'll like this.   On a scale of 20, I give it three thumbs up and -25% off coupon to a medium 2-topping pizza at participating locations. Would recommend.",

            "review_text": "A overall amazing game, has potential to compete with shooters like CS:GO, Battlefield and even Arma to some extent.  Gun mechanics are finally a break from the 'you have 90 bullets in your ar-15 and they magically go in your mag when reloading'.  Some quality-of-life and realism improvements/Things I'd like to see: -More guns -More character interaction (the character voice interaction is A1 in this game) -Surpression being more useful (making your screen a little bit blurry doesnt do that much. Especially support classes would benefit from this, as their main role is to lay down surpression fire over long distances. Maybe make it so if you get surpressed, you start to yell more, giving away your position, and maybe being more innacurate) -Guns don't come out of the scope, ffs. -Maybe make it so, when you are being surpressed or in adrenaline rush, you reload faster or something? -When you aim down sights while standing for too long, your hands get tired and your sights/scopes start to sway (depending on gun weight. (This will help against rpg's maybe?) -Clips for Mosin? -More voice interaction -Make it so when you are in need to switch to your handgun/get a grenade you can drop your weapon instead of holsting it then slowly taking out your throwable/gun. Maybe we will see inclusion of shoulder gun belts? -More voice interaction please  Overall, I rate this game 8.9/10   Also, props to /k/ for suggestions  EDIT:  -Guns are noisy as ♥♥♥♥ in real life, especially LMG's, sniper rifles and shotguns indoors. If you keep spamming that LMB you will probably get some ear disease. Add earpro as a accessory. This will also make surpressors more useful (by the way, surpressors DON'T make the gun go 'phoosh'. They're still loud). -Make going prone faster, like plunching yourself on your belly, when getting fired at -Muzzle flashes are a big deal when shooting at night.  EDIT 2: -Add a .357 revolver that you can load either .357 rounds or .38spc rounds (obviously, the 357rounds will do more damage but will kick a lot more, and the .38spc rounds will have much less recoil (due to the low power and gun weight) but will damage less, making it a good hit-and-run weapon maybe? -Maybe add so you can adjust grain ammount in bullets, maybe make a Hollow point +P abomination rifle that will one-shot unarmored opponents?",

            "review_text": "  The most exciting, immersive, fun, and lethal multiplayer FPS I have ever played.  The Battlefield...  If I had one word to describe the experience, it's TACTICAL. First, if you're coming from BF3/4, the COD franchise, or CS:GO/S, forget everything you've learned about gun fights. Two, or often one, hit will kill you which means you need to use cover, suppression, smoke, and flash to get around. Gun fights are TENSE - this is partly due to the lethality of weapons, but also the suppression mechanic: you can hear the bullets wizzing by your head, your screen blurs, and if you pop your head out at the wrong time - THWACK, and your dead.  MAPS are expertly designed, consistently updated, lots of variety, and new ones are created suprisingly often for such a small developer.  WEAPONS have character and I've found new favourites for given situations even 100 hours into playing. UNLIKE CS:GO where you have to memorize spray and spread patterns for each weapon, Insurgency weapons perform realistically in that, wherever the sights are pointed, THAT IS EXACTLY WHERE THE BULLET WILL GO - weapons still recoil, but you know exactly where the bullet is headed when it does.   GAME MODES - brilliant. Co-op is awesome, multiplayer modes are relatively diverse and awesome. What's really unique here is the emphasis on teamplay. You really need to coordinate with your team to win certain modes, whether its popping smoke or having someone cover you while you move up. What sets this game apart, other than everything else, is that players work together here - you're not playing with the silent majority on BF4 or COD - people are on their mics, strategizing and celebrating the game - mostly adults too (well, adults who yell 'Alloha Snackbar' as terrorists while throwing grenades at American Soldiers, haha). If you get this game, get mic please, you miss out on a lot of the fun and you contribute to making this game less fun for everyone.  Final Words...  One of my favourite games on PC. Kudo's to a great development team who keep this game alive with frequent updates and tourneys. They obviously have a passion for what they do, and it's part of what makes this game great.  It also happens to have a total conversion mod for my first multiplayer FPS (TPS*) addiction, Socom 1 &amp; 2 ( 'Socom: Source' ).",

            "review_text": "Do you want to get shot? 'Cos that's how you get shot!  This game has been described as a cross between Counterstrike and Red Orchestra 2, and I think that fits.  The arcadey pew-pew of CS is absent and instead you play in a more realistic environment where your cautiousness and tactical thinking is rewarded. The sense of immersion is greater than in CS, and while the pace is (generally) slower, as a result it's also more intense with the stakes seeming higher.  You WILL get one-shot-killed in this game. AND you will one-shot kill others. You know going in that this is the case: that bullets are very deadly. This affects the way you play and you value your life more, and this in turn increases the immersion.  You will NOT find yourself (as seems to happen in CS:GO) plugging several rounds into an enemy standing right in front of you who immediately one-shot-insta-kills you, and be left with the feeling that your death was somehow unfair.  The bots in co-op mode; waves of enemies that unlock after an objective has been achieved to protect the next objective or re-capture the one just taken (randomly triggered) behave, on the most part, very realistically. You'll get ones that see your head as you lie prone and headshot you and you'll get ones that rush past you, failing to spot you waiting round a corner (as well as ones who anticipate you hiding there). They never feel either under or over-powered and do a good job of convincing you they're real. The only exception is their tendency to disregard fire (from molotovs/incendiary grenades) and they will quite often simply stand in the flames and burn to death without fleeing or run straight into the fire, disregarding it and ... die. That needs fixing.  Co-op with 5 other players feels very good. Six player teams mean you don't feel too much individual responsibility most of the time, but that can suddenly change when at the last moment as your comrades have fallen you're thrust into the role of saving the team, capturing the objective and triggering their re-spawn against the odds. This can result in an Immense sense of achievement and reward when successful and (unless you're playing with Grade-A A-Holes) good-natured sympathy and/or hilarity when you fail. Communication with your team is often essential to succeed, the whole game mode is very enjoyable.  PvP is a blast and where the comparison to Red Orchestra 2 is closest. Squads of up to 16 players (although, as this is a Source-based game 12v12 is the norm) fight against each other across some beautiful and realistic maps.  You will love the warm glow of the sun in the late afternoon as you run through the crunchy snow, but you will also curse that very same sun getting in your eyes and obscuring your view of the other side of the ravine and that blasted snow for giving away your movement.  The feelings of 'oh crap, oh well, here goes' as your squadron marches into uncertain death that games like Red Orchestra and Planetside provoke is here, albeit on a somewhat smaller scale, but Insurgency does it better. It's prettier, smoother and more polished than RO2 and your value to your team is much higher than in both that and Planetside.  And did I mention how inexpensive it is? The Fun:Value ratio on this game is very, very high. If you have a few spare quid and a few friends to play this with, you will have a blast with Insurgency.",

The authenticity of this game is due to HUD realism (no radar, no hit markers), sound realism (let's just say you'll understand why people are hiding behind cover when you hear the bullets whizzing by), weapon feel and control, and loadout customization. The variety of guns, maps, and modes lend to its replayability. The AI in this game is probably the best I've seen so far, sometimes rivaling the skill of real players. The game supports the Steam Workshop where you can find some of the best maps, gun mods, and audio packs that really spice up the experience. One of the biggest personal selling points is the dedication and passion that the developers show for this game. Since release, they've released huge free content updates that include new maps, weapons, gameplay updates, and most recently, Linux support.  +Authentic experience +Loadout customization +Night mode +Great AI +Free content updates +Steam Workshop support +Linux support +Achievements +Trading Cards   No cons.",

            "review_text": "Insurgency is a tactical multiplayer FPS set in the middle-East and it's best described as a hybrid between Counter Strike and Red Orchestra. I would say the game is less realistic than Red Orchestra but more realistic than Counter Strike. The maps are also in between those games, so bigger maps than CS but smaller maps than RO.  Obviously, gameplay is the most important aspect of a game like this. Controlling your character and shooting just feels great. Since you often die in just a few hits, taking cover is essential and it makes your adrenaline pumping, every time you find yourself in a tight spot.  At the start of each game you have to pick one of the many classes and spend your points on guns (20+ in total) and other gear like; light/heavy armor, flashbangs, grenades or Nightvision goggles.   There are quite a few different game modes for you to choose from like; Ambush (one player is the VIP and should be protected, otherwise your team loses), Firefight (defend objectives from the opposing team). There are also a few modes to co-op vs bots like; Checkpoint (destroy, occupy and defend your positions, throughout the map), Hunt (Kill all bots and destroy their cache).  The graphics look great, nothing really to complain about.  As you would expect from a game set in the middle-East, most maps have a lot of sand and brown/yellow colors (although there are a few snowy maps as well). Still, there's lot of variety between the maps. Some for close quarter combat, some for open ranged combat, the developers simply did a great job creating interesting maps with the same template.  Personally, I prefer Insurgency over Counter Strike, at least for the time being. I can recommend this to anyone, who's looking for a good tactical multiplayer shooter.    ",

            "review_text": "This is the game that will stop me from playing Counter-Strike, I didn't expect to have so much with it. I've played so many different FPS and for a long time, like Battefield (since 1942), COD, I've played every CS, my playtime is ~1000 hours on CSGO and I think I won't play anymore cause of this game, cause of how addictive this game is. I think Insurgency is now my favorite FPS, but I do wish to see a bigger player base in the near future for this fantastic realistic fps. You won't see any usable airplanes, tanks, or jeep, just you and your feet.  Insurgency offers severals mods for every map to play, and you can customize every weapon at anytime while in spawn. The gameplay offers a realistic battlefield experience just by giving 'nothing', I mean it has no spotting at all on the HUD, you have no clue (no radar, no crosshair) where your ennemies are and who is shooting at you until a teammate tells you or you see him, and that's absolutely great. You actually don't know if you've killed someone, until you see the blood on the wall or see his dead body where he was standing. You just see where the objectives are, like Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, ... You need to cooperate with your teammates to win, voicetalk can be a real asset, having a squad leader too.  Insurgency was a few years ago just a mod for Half-Life 2, I've played it and I didn't enjoyed it, the gun mechanic was not at his best, now the gameplay is INSANE. This is the one shot, one kill game, in a realistic battlefield, you have been waiting for.  The graphics are not the best, but guess what? The game looks better than CSGO and they use both the source engine. You won't ever find a game with such a great sound effects. Guns feel real, they sound real, they will scare the hell out of you. Getting a kill is so rewarding, even more when you are the HVT (High Value Target) and you kill half of the opposite team by yourself before you escape and win the round (hey hey). However, getting kills is not your only priority, you need to do the objectives to revive your teammates (called waves) or you will be alone. You need to watch your corners, stop rushing cause sometimes defending a point you hold it's the best thing to do.   Finally I want to say someting about the smoke grenades, how they look awesome and how really effective in this game they are, so cloudy, dark and huge [insert a bad taste joke here], those grenades are a real asset in the battlefield if you want to take control of a point (A-B-C). I also like what developpers did to bullets that hit the ground, it makes the dirt/dust goes everywhere around you, it's something that helps you to notify that an ennemy is firing at you, so you can take cover or just disappear right away. You can even see where the bullets are coming from if you pay attention to it.  tl;dr : I recommend it.   9/10 : -1 cause the fan base is really low...but it's not the dev team fault, so +1. 10/10",

Everything is amazingly accurately depicted, from the grenade weight, the audio, the physics, the bullet penetration going through different materials, the suppressing fire system, everything about this game is intense and punishing if you ♥♥♥♥ up for a second while in a firefight.   It's times like this in a match where you're scoped in, looking to pick off any enemies, especially opposing snipers or grenadiers. You see an enemy sniper far away, and he sees you too. It's all a matter of who pulls the trigger faster, and you hear an empty dull click from your gun. No more bullets loaded in the chamber? You soon find yourself dead.   That's right, there's no ammo counter or anything that indicates how many shots you have left, nor a crosshair or a life bar. The only thing you have on your HUD is how many magazines you have left and a compass w/ a map you can toggle. This game requires good teamwork and communication to win matches, and it's rewarding to blow up the final enemy cache with a brick of C4 when you're the last man standing.   Bottom line: if you want a tactical shooter that delivers intense close quarters combat action, with a variety of huge maps as well, get this game, you will not be disappointed. My only gripe is that I wished the developers spent more time optimizing the game, because it only utilizes less than half of my cpu and gpu combined, which can lead to minor fps drops at times.

If you liked the old Ghost Recon games you will probably enjoy this game.  The atmosphere is top notch, the gunplay feels very very good (it has literally my favorite handgun/pistol gunplay ever), the controls are right where I would like them, the levels are well designed and most importantly it is just a blast to play.  After the horrible garbage that was Takedown: Red Sabre, it was so good to see another indie shooter that was gunning for the same crowd come in and just NAIL it, near perfectly. Every single aspect is better in this game, so fans of any of those games i mentioned above now have another modern style sim/realistic shooter that is fun to play with friends and calls for teamwork.  The ai is good in this game so you really have to take you're time and be ready for some intense firefights. I enjoy playing coop on this as I did in Ghost Recon/Rainbow Six back in the day, a ton of fun with friends!   In the end this is a shining example of how to do a indie shooter in a niche area and do it well. Also this was a early access game and another good example of how EA games should be.

The graphics are great even on the lower settings, and the user interface is the epitome of barebones. The only thing that really shows on your screen is how many magazines you have left. There's no minimap, no radar, no '23/30'. It's great because it makes you rely on what you're seeing going on in the game universe around you as opposed to looking at a gadget in the corner. You can tell when you're being fired at because tracers will be lighting up the world around you, and you'll know it's close because you'll hear a hiss or a snap. You note that green tracers are used by the insurgents and red are used by the Security. Something like that I can appreciate because it is more immersive.   The gameplay itself is usually pretty hectic and a good number of the times in PvP you'll find yourself wondering what's going on. PvE is fun because there's nothing like slaying 40 insurgents with your friends, and the last one fires an RPG and every single one of you dies.   The workshop community is great, you can get anything from graphics updates to new skins for your weapons or even sillier mods that change your grenades to pokeballs and your weapons sounding like anime girls when you reload them.   Since I purchased the game back in November 2014, the devs have been meticulous in updating their game, they add new maps, fix glitches, and cosmetic changes like scope reticules and the like. As far as I can tell if the fanbase wants something, the devs will try to add it in if it's a good idea.   So basically it's a current game with fantastic gameplay and a dedicated dev team who actively upkeep their work.   10/10.",

The game is based on two different game types: PvP and Co-op mode, both modes includes a supply management: when you win objectives you earn supplies to add new gear/weapons to your character so choose well when you start and pick clever upgrades depending of the weapons and stragtegy you choose to go with.  PvP is a decent classic team deathmatch/capture point gametype but there's no doubt the most intersting part is the coop one: fights against clever bots with tactics and deadly accuracy.  If you are looking for a good co-op challenge i highly recommend it.  Note that this game is still in developement and there're many improvement to be made and things to be added.",

            "review_text": "Updated Review #2: I feel it's time to revisit the review for Insurgency. The game has progressed quite well since it left Early Access. The game has seen a multitude of free DLC map updates and additions to an already rock solid base of a game.  The ambience of the game is fantastic. The sound effects, the maps, the characters, and music all culminate into a perfect blend of FPS goodness.  NWI clearly has taken pride behind their work and has kept forward with it's ideas for it's game to keep it fresh and rewarding. I can't recommend this game enough as it's one of the best purchases on Steam that comes to mind.  Updated Review: I would say this is perhaps one of the best FPS purchases I've ever made. If you are a FPS fan you need to give this a chance and find out why Insurgency is awesome. The studio behind this game clearly had a vision and has supported this game since launch with A+ content updates.   Original review: Insurgency is a fantastic source FPS shooter that thrives on realism, teamwork, sensical, and most importantly tactical based gameplay. It's a blast, it looks good, the asking price is a fraction of what most FPS games charge out of the gate, and it's an absolute steal at their 14.99 asking price.  With a thoughtful system of each side having set open types of players who have a limited option of weapons that can be adjusted with attachments, secondary firearms, accessories, and points that determine what you'll be able to have and not have the game doesn't let everyone run rampant with the same setups. Each person has meaning to their side and there's none of that over the top arcadey FPS stuff here with streaks for assists and kills.  It's what I've wanted for a long time in a shooter and if you have found enjoyment with Red Ochestra 2 and/or Rising Storm this may be right down your alley.",

No crosshair, no health regen, no kill confirmation, no grindy leveling system, friendly fire on (default). The approach is realistic but it's not a sim. Firing rpg or triggering a c4 explosion will get you killed if you don't use them carefully.  Focusing on the coop part of the game, you will face unforgiving AI that will throw at you frag, smoke nades and will try to flank you. Speaking about the hardest settings, you may argue with me that AI bots seem like aimbotting but it's just what skilled players would do. If you don't pull the trigger first, they will. Maps are pretty intense and require teamwork, patience and tactical approach. No lonewolf rambo would survive much long here. There is also a nice radial menu to communicate with your team vital info without the use of a mic, which is not required but recommended. This game reminds me a bit of the first Ghost Recon. To me this game is already worth full money for only the coop experience, not to mention that it will get steamworks support.  About pvp multiplayer i cannot say much since i didn't play it enough, though the couple of games i played felt good to me. There are like 6 different pvp modes to accomodate most of tastes: some single life modes and some with respawns. There is still no pure team deathmatch but it would not fit this game because it relies on objectives you have to accomplish with your team.",

The suppression is insane, and while the graphics aren't top of the line, they are very playable. The fire effects are simply beatiful. Sound is immersive, combat is intense and damage is brutal, the grenade mechanics are unmatched (I mean, where else can you pull the pin and leave in the spoon for worry free cooking?), and the overall experience is simply amazing. I have nothing but good things to say about Insurgency.

Zero health regeneration, quick deaths, and the fact that your opponent could be just around the corner make for very exciting gameplay that keeps players on edge, fingers ready on their left mouse button. Matches are usually fast and furious, adding to the tension and excitement. In addition, an assortment of gamemodes and maps exist for those players who like variety. Players can take on other players head-on in a Firefight match or attempt to survive against AI-controlled enemies in nighttime environments while playing Survival. Also, the community is rather friendly and they churn out marvelous stuff that is available in the Steam Workshop. Yes, I forgot to mention that Insurgency does possess Workshop support. These workshop items offer numerous customizations and could make playing Insurgency even more fun. The developers, New World Interactive, are also very active, often looking for opinions from the community on how to improve the game and releasing frequent patches and updates.   However, as is the case with every game, Insurgency does have its weak points. It can be quite buggy at certain times and the community is rather small at the moment. Nevertheless, these are not major flaws and are vastly overshadowed by the pros of playing this game.   For a relatively low price, Insurgency offers a very in-depth experience comparable to that of bigger and more showy titles like Battlefield or Call of Duty.

In all honesty, many of the characteristics that would make it more realism-oriented (a complete lack of respawns, wound system, no HUD, ...) would in no doubt hurt the gameplay, which is now excellent. It certainly feels like a real firefight and the coop is as unforgiving as the player-v-player. The gameplay is tweaked in such a way that teamwork is not just key, but also a necessity to survival. This makes it important to communicate with other players, which obviously makes it a lot of fun.  If youre sick of bunnyhopping-shooters where you can go full Rambo without repercussions or if you have grown insensitive about being under fire (it's not easy shooting back in this game if you're being shot at) then this is the game for you.   This is not a sell-out big company game. They do a lot of effort to keep the price low, reward it!",

A good two nights worth of play so I don't think I'm up to 16. That must count afk time. Anyway.... It's a fun game! It's objective team based 'realistic' shooter with a terrorist/ counterterrorist theme. It features PvP and PvE maps based on which server you join. It's not a run and gun type of game. Running actually feels pretty slow and walking is even slower. There is a little run+slide thing for getting to cover and you can go prone so there's a little more depth than just walking and shooting. No crosshairs except for iron sights or mods that you put on your gun. Being 1 life to live, a couple twitch players (or cheaters, I don't know) can really turn a battle. Of course if you manage to kill that guy, it really hurts the team too. Built in VOIP is good quality but of course you also have to deal with trolls. Tip: To kick someone, hit ESC and Call Vote.  PvE experience can vary depending on your tolerance for aimbots. You are playing against bots so without good scripting the only way to vary difficulty is to change the speed of their aimbot. On Brutual, it's not uncommon to insta-die before you see the bot because he shoots you through the corner of a wall that you can barely see his foot past. PvE modes vary too. Most commonly you'll play checkpoint which is like progressing through an assault map in Battlefield. You push up to an objective, capture it, and then progress down the map to the next objective, continuing to do so until you win or die. 1 life to live until someone captures an objective and all players are revived. The most annoying mode is Survival where you run around from objective to objective, usually with just a pistol and knife, trying to avoid getting killed by bots. If bots are on Brutal, one of these maps will clear out the server if there isn't an admin to change it. lol...  PvP is good. Maps can be like capture the flag or assault-type maps like from Battlefield. Teams usually have 'waves' which is respawns as opposed to a ticker per life. Depending on the map, waves can be gained by capturing objectives allowing for some very fun and intense matches when your team is hanging onto that last wave, trading an objective back and forth with the opposing team. Weapons seem relatively balanced but I always do better w/ Security (CT) weapons than Insurgents (T).   The game could do with a few ease of life updates like saving preferred builds but overall it's a very good game. I don't know how much it normally goes for but that 4 pack bundle for $45 making it about $11/ea doesn't sound that bad. Of course I got the 4 pack as part of a $12 humble bundle with Saints Row IV included so I definitely think it's worth it!",

            "review_text": "Insurgency is what modern shooters should strive to be like. Setting the standard with extremely difficult but fair gameplay it draws you in by making you actually think about your decisions in game. 'Should I lean around this corner?' 'If I take this path will there be more enemies?'   The game presents you with tactical decisions that most of the time can and will decide if you live or die. The core mechanics of the game rely on teamwork, you have to communicate, you have to be vigilant and watch each other's back. Failure means somebody was not doing their job properly. I've been playing Insurgency since the early beta and I'm extremely happy with forward progress that New World Interactive has had. Despite that however, there are still some things left to be desired.    PROS:  Extremely tight, precise controls.  Good balance of classes and weapons.  Variety of games modes to play.  Very accurate representation of real world firearms.   Fun but challenging gameplay.  Great community of modders.  CONS:  Somewhat hostile PvP and sometimes PvE communties.  Bots that can snipe you from half a mile away with AK irons.  Random heatseaking RPGs out of nowhere.   Alt+Tab sometimes completely crashes the game.   Online Servers can be finnicky at times.   Hit detection can sometimes fail completely.   Suggestions :  More general profile stats; Games played, won, lost, accuracy.  Improved party system.   Better server search function.   Reworking the damage and range of shotguns. Most of the time I completely disregard the shotgun because of it's tendency either not hit an enemy from 5m away or just not do any damage if I hit them at all.  Reworking some maps, I.E. Heights.     Overall, Insurgency is a great game with a huge learning curve. You cannot jump into this game with the intention of running through and mowing down anything in your path. The decisions you make result in how much fun you have with the game. New World Interactive does an extremely good job of updating the AI's pathfinding and combat skills. I feel with every update the games becomes more challenging, and with that more rewarding when you finally beat a map. This is not a game for people who are used to Battlefield or Call of Duty play styles. Once you get past the gigantic learning curve Insurgency becomes a game that you simply cannot put down.    ",

You die so easily that you make sure to yourself that every corner, nook, and cranny is clear before you get into opening up. Even so, people can get lucky by running away from bullets in certain cases. I found myself literally hopping away from AK fire like I did in CS:GO. While the shooting mechanics make it have that realistic feel, it still has it's casual elements aswell. If you ever play in a public game, be sure to pick the ones that involve long respawn times (or none) because it attributes to much more team work and strategy. If you pick a casual match where everyone spawns seconds after death, you're talking about a free run shooting gallery in a nutshell.

You see, Insurgency is a combination of so many FPS games today such as Counterstrike, Arma, Red Orchestra, Battlefield, even bits of COD too form this hardcore shooter. The game modes offer a variety of fun, yet tense hardcore scenarios ranging from the classic Push mode to the more hardcore Firefight version. The sound quality in this game is amazing! Hearing bullets flying past your head and crashing into the brick wall behind you gives you a very nervous and epic feel to the game that others fail to do. My first taste of the multiplayer was amazing, running towards Point A in Push on Peak to capture it while my teammates fired at the Insurgents in the hills, it felt absolutely immersive and cool. From the PvP multiplayer is when i got into Co-Op.    Now this game mode is seriously AMAZING. The AI somehow overs more intense feelings to the already intense feel in a more realistic yet surprising factor. Lets just say the AI is stupid, but at the same time smart. Yes, they have the same extremely amazing accuracy but that just makes it more frusturating. The thing is, they throw grenade and molotovs that actually AFFECT you. I was in a game where my team was trying to push through a building to capture the point when a bot threw a molotov on top of us, burning us down until half of us died. Did i tell you Co-Op also supports teamplay? As the leader role in one of the Co-Op games, i guided my teammates by placing 'Suppress this area' where the enemies were getting us from and telling everyone to stay back, take cover and kill as many of the bots before they overrun us. Now that was amazing.  As you can see with my 16 hours, i havent made it so far in the game but those hours were worth the $7.49 i got for this game. So what are you waiting for? Buy the game NOW or else the Insurgents will get you. ALLAH ACKBAR!",

So, when it's on sale, I decided to buy the 4-pack edition of the game so I can play with my friends. I never regret it at all.  Insurgency is all about teamwork, communication and pure combat skills. When you play this game for the first time, it's a breath of pure fresh air. It makes you feel like you're in real combat with adrenaline pump in all over your body.This game also feautures realistic damage, where one shot to the chest may kill you instantly, with no-kill cam whatsoever. It features multiple gamemodes and all of them requires good team coordination! Like CO-OP for example, bots are not really smart but the weapon damage bots have is the same to us, that's why they're deadly even if they are not smart. Also, the multiplayer is pure teamwork to win. There are normal gamemodes like Firefight and also interesting gamemodes like Infiltrate too.  The best part of it though, is, the workshop. I downloaded more than 20 workshop contents, like the ACR carbine, CompM4 RDS, DEVGRU uniforms and so on! There are plenty to download thanks to the great Insurgency community. However, original in-game contents are also good but workshop just adds customisation up a bit.  The downsides I found to be annoying (All in PVP gamemodes), are corner camping, like any player can basically just lay down behind a corner and just shoot you with ease when you round the corner or push in a building, however, they can be countered with good crosshair positioning and explosives. So about, explosives, they can be spammed in tight areas, which most of them are objective zones, like a house with a capture point, for example, if you're capturing it, be ready for multiple 10-meter damage radius grenades that will fly into the zone.  My conclusion is that, buy it now, realistic and hardcore FPS fans would love this game. There are tactical and realistic elements like Arma, mixed with medium paced action and objective teamplay like Battlefield. However, there are some annoying exploits or gameplay problems in PVP gamemodes but it's not game breaking. There is also a workshop full of usable in-game community items to use with too! 8.5/10",

            "review_text": "Insurgency is a fun and addicting semi-realistic FPS, with a prominent focus on teamwork. It basically has it all; Good graphics, intense gameplay, large selection of maps, etc.    Insurgency adds realistic elements to the gameplay, including limited hud, no killcams, reduced ability of the player to survive multiple gunshot wounds, etc.    It is quite an intense game. The feeling of adrenaline you get when you're pinned down by enemy fire, trying your best to stay alive is what makes this game truly shine. Now, what it lacks in quantity it makes up for in quality. There aren't a  whole   lot of weapons, but the game makes up for that in the quality of them. Most guns (excluding the sniper rifles and pistols) have the option of changing their fire mode. Usually the choices are Semi, Burst, and Auto, so you can choose whichever works best for you.    Since Insurgency is semi-realistic, you the player can die in just a blink of an eye. It only takes 2-3 shots and you're dead. It only takes one stray RPG rocket to take you and your whole team out. In this game, you are not a walking tank that games like Call of Duty make you out to be. In order to survive, you need to work with your teammates to finish the mission.    The game's Online community is usually pretty active, so you shouldn't have too much trouble finding some teammates to pair up with. In general, if you're a fan of games like ArmA and Rainbow Six, definitely check this game out.   Pros:  - Good graphics - Large variety of maps - Semi-Realistic gameplay - Active community  Cons: - Can be frustrating, especially if playing by yourself - Rather small selection of weapons  Final Rating: 8.5/10",

Es divertido, desafiante e inmersivo, sin irse al carajo con el realismo frutero de la serie ARMA. Sería más bien como un 'simulador arcade', ya que no es tan estricto con la fisica (no hay bullet drop, por ejemplo), pero tendrás que tener paciencia, concentración y timing para agarrarle la mano a las tácticas y los movimientos de tu pelotón. Se disfruta más jugando entre amigos y la comunicación por VoIP es casi estrictamente necesaria.  Hay varios modos tanto en Jugador contra Jugador como en Jugador contra el entorno (el modo cooperativo soporta hasta 8 jugadores en simultaneos contra la IA), y la comunidad y los desarrolladores detrás de este juego son geniales. Corriendo en Source, el juego está un poco pasado, pero se defiende bastante respecto a otros juegos del género, sobre todo en la rejugabilidad.  10/10 Excelente shooter táctico arcade.",

Bought at Price:  $0 - gifted by friend through Humble Bundle  I'm a huge fan of Source powered titles — even more so of mods going pro. Insurgency is yet another title like that of Contagion, but steps up to the plate ready and focused.  I played the original source mod way back when, and said this looked cool. It wasn't my taste back then as I found it too hard. There were some neat features, but that was it.  When the whole Battlefield/EA thing with Valve happened, I gave up on the series and haven't looked back. It's the classic milking the cash cow with Origin. The sad part is I still wished something like Battlefield would come along again. EA even wondered why Battlefield Bad Company 2 did so well (hint: it was the last title they cared about and put on Steam).  This is exactly what the developers of Insurgency do right. They care about their game, and take care of it. They push updates out for free, and don't try to nickel and dime you. You can see a lot of Valve's philosophies in this title yet Valve didn't have anything really to do with this game.  Released on the 'Portal 2' branch, this title does provide some solid looking graphics, yet isn't leading in any form. Players will focus more about the game mechanics in this game rather than the looks.   The gameplay is slow, yet fast. While you are almost encouraged to camp, there are benefits in rushing. Taking place in both wide open maps and urban towns and cities, you will feel naked sometimes.  Unlike Battlefield Bad Company 2 – the closest title which I can compare to – there's no dog tags, bonus pins and all that. It's more hardcore then Battlefield in many ways yet isn't as realistic. To my big disappointment, there's no blowing up buildings in this game.  Overall, Insurgency has filled the missing gap in my library. I’ve longed for a good title to put my money in to for a while now and this is the game.",

There was no option to play hardcore barebones though. You had to choose between one or the other. I remember thinking, 'wouldn't it be nice if they had a hardcore barebones game mode'. Even though this game has weapon attatchments, this for me is as close as it gets. With kills taking only 1-2 shots from your mag, it feels almost more like a paintball game in comparison to other shooters i've played. The guns in insurgency feel and sound great too. Gun fights are intense in the sense that you have no hit markers and no way to tell if you killed the person other than a visual confirmation. So popping your head out for that second look could mean death, or that you're clear to advance. Something else thats nice about this game is that the   rich don't get richer  . Unlike most other popular shooters, there is no leveling system to unlock guns/attachments and increase character stats. And for ingame there are no killsteaks. This is a game that focuses more on the core game mechanics than visual polish. In short, if you are looking for a shooter that has a realistic feel and is tactical, i highly recommend this game.",

            "review_text": "Insurgency combines the tactical gameplay of games like ARMA with the seriousness of death of games like Counter-Strike, except at a slightly faster pace. If you like the tactical feeling of those games, but hated the long periods of waiting in ARMA and the huge skill gap in Counter-Strike because of lack of iron sights, then you'll probably find Insurgency fun.  Working with your team is important, and you'll find that many players have mics ready to go, either over TS or the in-game VOIP.   The game's graphics aren't amazing, but the sound quality and voice acting is excellent, and they devs have done wonderful things with the particle effects. Muzzle flashes and sparks from impacts are really pretty, and the smoke that drifts from gun barrels after firing are a nice touch. Dust and smoke kick up from bullet impacts, which can obscure your vision and hinder you as much as the suppression system (similar to Battlefield 3-4) does.  There are a variety of gamemodes to play: online PvP, online co-op, and offline singleplayer matches against bots. The PvP gamemodes are similar to Battlefield's Rush mode and CoD's Search and Destroy, but the respawning is limited to waves or objective captures, similar to Red Orchestra 2. Co-op is a ton of fun, very similar to ARMA's Domination mode, but on a smaller scale. You can't just rush in and kill everything, you need to take it slow and communicate, or the AI will take you apart. There are several co-op mission types as well, Checkpoint being the best among them in my opinion.  The AI is better than ARMA II's, and they're decent shots to the point where they don't have to overwhelm you with numbers in order to kill you. Death happens very quickly, like in ARMA, where one bullet to the head or with a heavier weapon and two bullets from most other weapons will kill you instantly. On higher difficulties the AI becomes more numerous and even scarier shots, even better than another player would be. They lack the ability to move like a player does in terms of peeking and use of cover, but they're not the mindless robots of ARMA II's NPCs.  There's no HUD whatsoever, apart from indicators on your teammates within a certain distance, objective labels, and the number of magazines you have remaining for your equipped weapon. You have no way of knowing how many bullets are in the magazine unless you count the rounds as you fire them, which I think is a nice touch of realism. I would have preferred a Red Orchestra 2 style of things, where you could hold 'R' to check the magazine and get a general idea of how full it is, but this works nicely as well.  The game also remembers whether or not you have a round chambered - as you spawn you can reload most magazine-fed weapons to get a 30+1 ammo count.  The class system is a little annoying. You can customize your loadouts with the Supply system, which gives you a certain amount of points to spend on gear, which I think is cool, but each class only has access to a limited pool of primary weapons and equipment, and the class names are not clear on which one has what. Furthermore, the names are different depending on whether or you're playing Security or Insurgents, which only adds to the confusion. I figured out which classes had which weapons more through trial and error than anything else. Also, your squad only has a limited number of roles. If someone's taken the Support gunner slot in your squad, you'll have to switch to another squad in order to be their Support, again similar to RO2's system. It works well to balance things in PVP, I find, but it also means that if you're stuck with a crappy player in an important role your experience may suffer.  All in all, if you like the tactical gameplay of ARMA and Counter-Strike, working with teammates, and prefer iron sights and scopes to the lack thereof in CS, then you will definitely enjoy this game.   Population is around 4,500 every time I've logged on, and there are plenty of servers, At the time of writing Insurgency is in the Humble Bundle along with three extra copies, so that could be why so many people are on, but the game is definitely not dead. The devs also release free content updates from time to time, which means more things to do and more weapons to use at no extra cost.  However, if you get upset easily and can't handle dying suddenly and frequently, you may not find this game enjoyable. It's really not a complicated game, easy to pick up and play, and once you've done the training mission and played a few gamemodes you're basically ready to go, but you will get suddenly killed from long range quite often until you learn to use cover properly. Most of the players I've come across tend to be older, as well, as this sort of game doesn't generally appeal to younger players, which vastly improves your experience as far as I'm concerned.  I got this game for free as part of the Humble Bundle deal, but I feel that it's totally worth the regular $15 price tag.",

The gunplay is amazing, the scope sway and rifle kick are proper, and the netcode is optimized to prevent bs things from occuring. It's challenging, and unforgiving, and I really like those aspects as it's what kept me going back to it. That and you can mod the hell out of it with all sorts of different optics, firearm models, audio packs, among many other things without breaking gameplay 'balance'. But I have had enough: The movement is awful. Worst in any FPS game I've ever played. See that little brick on the ground next to you? You will get stuck to it, for some reason your incompetent guy just can't seem to navigate around that brick, it's anchored to the ground and you're stuck to it like a fly in a spider's web. I've died so many times just bashing away at them mouse when an enemy is right in front of me but I can't shoot because I'm in the middle of changing stance and apparently the guy I'm playing as is too mentally deficient to process pulling a trigger while getting his ♥♥♥ off the ground. Your mentally slow character limits how well you can channel your skill into performance. That limit doesn't exist when you're aiming and shooting, but movement is SO clumsy. An FPS game with awful movement mechanics becomes an arcade shooter except instead of a plastic gun you get a mouse and keyboard. Once you know the map, you start to do really well, and the game shines. Once you know all the spawnkilling locations, you start to do TOO WELL, and the game is ruined. I can't tell you how many times I've played through a whole game and just can't get out of spawn because an RPG flew into it, or C4 was planted right in front of everyone, or just some guy lying prone in a hall of death. It's non-stop dying until the match is over-no fun at all. Supposedly all of the problems should be solved when everyone can vote for whatever they want. Want to change the next map to XYZ? No problem. Want to kick player XYZ for being afk or excessive teamkilling? No problem. Want to kick another player on the other team for spawn-killing your team? Oh you can't do that, because that would be broken. You could kick the entire other team this way. This democratic system is completely dumb, even if someone is breaking server rules and spawnkilling the other team on your team, nobody is going to votekick them. That guy is the best person on the team, denying the opposing team any sort of action to attack or defend an objective, so nobody except for the nonexistent moderators will try to get them kicked. I'm not going to lie, I found myself sometimes being that ♥♥♥♥ in the corner gunning down unwary folks running out of spawn, and every time I hate myself afterwards for doing it even if my team rejoices after winning and complements me. It feels sickly wrong. How could I forget to mention, that some of the maps are FAR from balanced. Yes it's a difficult job to balance each and every map in the game, but it's absolutely crucial in order for the game to have any chance of being fun. For example, on Seige, if you're insurgent and you sit in A and hold that one position behind c4-proof cover, you win the match. If you're defending B on Dry Canal, just get to the rooftops and camp. Buhriz, Sinjar, Dry Canal, and Panj are awful on Push, if you're attacking and your team doesn't know how to use smoke, you're either going to do the smart thing and sit in the back and not play the objective, or you're going to be used as a meat shield. Because of the voting system, those maps will ALWAYS be picked by people who want nothing more than easy kills and wins. It's not to say however that you will always lose if you're on the wrong side, rarely you will find yourself on a team that knows how to use smokes and how to clear objectives with explosives. It's such a gratifying experience to play on that kind of team, but particularly rare. I will not advise this game to anyone, sure it's cheap as dirt and it's a full-featured multiplayer game, but it's not worth the endless frustration you invest into a game where everywhere where you turn you will be stuck on a pixel, be given an explosive dental treatment every other time you spawn, and have your vote never matter because it will always be overturned by a stupid majority of players who think every damn game is TDM. The mechanics of this game are so easily abused, there is good incentive to abuse them, and although the developers actually adhere to feedback from the community, they don't address fundamental flaws. Seeing as progress is kind of slow, I will reinstall this game in one year and see if I can be proven wrong. I really want to be proven wrong.",

No, in this game you do the objective and kill enemies that are trying to prevent you to do the objective. You have to choose wisely your weaponry for close combat or long range engagements. Remeber that wearing kevlar and ammo will make you more heavier and make you more slower. So choose wise, heavy gear might not be good when you are stealing a objective and light gear might not be good while defending you last position.  AIM! hipfire is just for noobs that don't know what is right mouse button. Scopes are useful in long range engagements but in a small room Red Dot scope might be useful, but best is the iron sights. They will never let you down. Also remeber that small firearms ex. Submachine guns, shotguns, pistols are useful in close combat but when you need range it is time to pick up that assault rifle. Same goes for LMGs. LMGs are made for support and should be used for covering your own troops and keeping enemy heads down. Remember to duck when you load LMGs because enemies snipe you down easily while you load.  Remeber to carry molotovs or explosives while your playing flashpoint. It is important that blow up those targets because your teammates aren't always there to help you. Always carry atleast two because your first try might not hit. Also remeber that when you take explosives you lose equipment points so choose wisely what gun and what attachtments you take with you. Also sidearm can safe yourlife so always keep your pistol with you. 'It is faster to switch to your side arm than reloading' - Cpt. Price ",

Insurgency is a very realistic multiplayer FPS that makes every shot in the dark (sometimes literally) to make this game hardcore and real. You can take weapons available for your selected role in the team and customize them with attachments to make them easier to handle and deadlier to use. Every shot counts and getting hit will most likely mean your death, as a ton of the weapons deal high damage and all can be equipped with armor penetration rounds to make kills easier. There are even missions in the night, forcing you to use flashlights and night vision goggles to keep you aware of your surroundings.  Getting kills in this game is incredibly satisfying, because the weapons do so much damage, and you know that you got that kill because you outsmarted and outplayed the people that try to threaten the progress of your team. It's also rewarding to defend objectives, because a single person can single-handedly hold a chokepoint crucial to the other team's success, granted you can get past any of the smokes and grenades the enemy team throws down.  If you're the kind that has the patience to practice and adopt to high skill ceilings, then this game is definately for you.",

If your looking for a singleplayer game this isn't it, it's mainly built for online and contains a lot of maps and modes to keep you busy. It has:  1. Classes (join one of the two squads, both contains different classes such as support or sniper which also contain different equipment)  2.Modes (want to play against a.i then join coop where there is mission based or just pure horde mode facing waves of enemies. If your wanting pvp then join the many modes of pvp such as siege where one team defends objectives and the other attack or play capture the flag or capture zones forcing players to work together to protect their bases.   3. Death changes everything (every mode contains 'reinforcements' however these reinforcements are limited so if you die your out until the next wave comes in meaning your team will be short a few soldiers until the reinforcement wave timer counts down to 0 spawning your fallen teammates back into the fight...just watch out spawns are limited so if your team uses the waves up then it's left to your remaining forces against whatever is left on the enemy side)  4. Teamwork is required ( this game isn't about running around blasting away...well it is sort of. But with your loadout some of your gear will weight you down changing how you move and how much damage you take. The game forces teamwork to get the job done...you need cover fire then get a support teammate to suppress that area...need a target sniped then work with the sniper members...need ammo cache destroyed then get your demo member in there. And with the spawns set on a timer and limited it makes each member important because when you run out it becomes a nightmare especially if the other team still has a lot more reinforcement spawns left)   Overall it's a great online shooter for those wanting a change from counter strike or Day of Defeat and really want a game based around working together.",

            "review_text": "This game combines some of the best elements of the various popular shooters, and adds a whole host of realism to boot. It is the first game that I've played in years that feels like one of the older mid-2000s shooters, like CoD1-2 (except modern, obviously). The gameplay is fast-paced yet tactical. Patience and accuracy are king, and rushing rarely gets you anything. It's not always a one shot kill, but it often is, so be careful. While body armor may save your life, if you are playing carelessly, you won't do well. But at the same time, almost all the game modes have some sort of control point capturing system, so if you sit back and camp, you won't be helping your team much. If you land on a team that happens to use comms, then it is a very fun experience.  The game modes are all fairly similar, but each has their own unique elements. There are only one or two game modes where a round can last for 10-20 minutes. If you die, you rarely sit on the sidelines for more than 30 seconds to a minute - you either respawn in that time, or the round ends. Most game modes require teams to capture and hold objectives, and your team gets rewarded for doing so with additional respawns. Run out of 'waves' and you will have a tough time coming back. The good thing about this system is that, if one team is much better than another, you aren't suffering through a 20 minute match getting spawn killed with no hope. The round will end, and then you can try again. All the game modes are pretty well-balanced, though. It's rare that one team will win all rounds on a map, and if they do, it's usually because they are communicating, not just because they are better.  You can customize your loadout by selecting between a number of primary weapons (depending on your class, but the class is much less restrictive than battlefield) and equipping a number of attachments. You can also select alternate weapons like explosives, a sidearm, or a chest carrier for more ammo and an extra grenade. The class and squad system allows certain weapons, but it's more like America's Army than BF. You can be a rifleman or a marksman or support, but that doesn't necessarily mean you have to select a certain weapon.  But my favorite thing about it is that, though it tracks your lifetime score and has achievements, there are no unlockables, no level bonuses, etc. All the attachments and weapons above are selected from a pool of supply points that you get at the start of each match. You may have 8 points, where a grenade is two points, a red dot sight is one point, body armor is two points, etc. Doing well at the game does not put you at an advantage by unlocking better items.  Additionally, and also uncommon and underrated these days, is that each side has its own types of weapons. Security forces use US/NATO weapons - M16, M4, M249, etc - and Insurgents use common militant weapons - AK47 or 74, RPG, etc. You can't just use the same weapon every game like you can in other shooters, so it adds another element of strategy.",

However the problem with the maps is that the community seems to vote for the same 3 or 4 maps so there isn't going to be a lot of map variety (or at least there isn't in my time of playing). The guns are great and are even better if you download an enhanced Insurgency sound pack. One or two shots and the enemy is down, you won't have to worry about wasting your ammo... unless you're on full auto, that sh*t is hard to control at med-long ranges. There aren't very many weapons to choose from however but I've heard from the developers that they're working on new weapons.  The community is... strange, to say the least. Haven't come across too many problems in regards to people mic spamming and trolling. A quick vote kick will change that even if you do come across a mic spammer.  I'd recommend this game to anyone who loves first person shooters. It's slow paced, so don't go expecting to sprint around the map and spray the crap out of the enemy because you will die.

You move from cover to cover towards objective Charlie and as you arrive you spot 2 enemy reinforcements incoming from the other side. The other teammate from before has now taken position at the window and snipes one of the enemies. The other sprints inside a building where suddenly gunshots can be heard, he killed one of your other teammates. You have almost captured objective Charlie which is needed to win the game as you have conquered all the objective zones... As you look around for the last time you see that the capturing has stopped, the enemy is closeby. You check your ammo for your primary rifle and notice it's empty, you take out your sidearm and toss a flashbang at the other side of your cover.

The gun custimization allows me to dispatch muslams in a diverse amount of ways ranging from an old WW2 pistol to devasting fire grenades that allow me to burn my enemies like a flank steak. The maps are very large allow for a good amount of exploring, I love searching every corner looking for muslams to cleanse from this world.

I am a fan of realistic first person shooters like red orchastra/rising sun (if you know those titles you'll understand when you play this) but wanted a more modern setting and I found it here. Insurgency is a good solid, realistic, team based game, where lone wolves will get picked off as well as those that run and gun.  The graphics are reasonable for a game I believe started life as a mod with well designed and put together environments. There are also a ton of maps, but like many games, after each match you get to pick the next one so you might keep seeing the same ones often. Game types are plentiful but I can not elaborate to much on those as I have only played push. As for music to me it sounds a bit like it is from the transformers movies but when I mentioned this everyone just wrote 'lol' in side chat.  The weapons are fantastic and you have access to them all from the beginning with no time spent to unlock the rifle to beat them all if you catch my drift. The weapons you use during the game depend on the class you pick though meaning be quick to get your choice in if you want the sub machine guns or sniper rifles. Weapons have a good feel about them when in use, the recoil is good and the sounds are almost spot on with brilliant textures.   The only annoying factor with insurgency and I will quote another reviewer here, 'I played so well that ISIS tried to recruit me' this game is strangely plagued with people who scream 'allah akbar' whether in jest or not if you are easily offended just mute people like I do and don't get involved. It can get loud but I have not witnessed any racism. I have not played long at the point of writing this but I have played enough to include this in my review as a warning.  To sum up Insurgency it is for mature players that are looking for a solid team-focused and realistic game with decent weapons, plenty of maps and is able to fufill that strange phenomenon that all gamers posses and thats shooting each other in the face for enjoyment.  Thumbs up and highly recommended. If you think the price is steep just think you'll probably spend three times as much on call of duty advanced warfare and really you only go there for the multiplayer anyway and from what I have heard it doesnt even work ;) (no surprise there then)  +There are also mods for this game that change weapon textures and adds maps ++Smoke is yours and those that are around you's friend, that is including the enemies who might manuever to out flank you!",

            "review_text": "I like this shooter very much. Another 8/10 game. Here is a quick list for those who are considering this game. 1. The price is right for this quality game. 2. The movements of people and reaction to objects feels really good, quite realistic and changes with the amount of weight you are packing. I also liked the little movements like leaning, sliding and jumping. 3. The weapon sounds are top notch! When you are firing the shot gun, it really sounds and behaves like a shot gun. I was really impressed with the high frequency 'ring' that comes out of the guns. Anyone who fires rifles and shotgunsrecognise that they recorded and recreated a fuller spectrum of a guns noise. 4. Really good enviormental sounds. When you walk through water, broken glass, dry ground, grass, it all sounds different. 5. Great maps. Not too small, not too big. Tons and tons of little enviormental models, clutter, doors that operated, windows that break, garbage that you can hide in. 6. Really good terrain. Holes, craters, ditches, broken walls ect. Even when out in the open there is still some level of cover. Also great detail for buildings, most enterable with several floors and windows for shooting out of. They are aranged in a way that makes sense. Not meant to either force or limit a choke point. It allows you to play the way you want to. 7. The 3D proximity voip. I love all games that have this, and this one does it really well. 8. The game modes are awsome, competitve and makes sense. It's a great compramise between repawn and knock out shooters. Camp if you want to, but if you do it will most likely cost you the match because objectives count and if you let your enemy complete them it grants them 'waves' of respawns. 9. Mininmalistic HUD that can be customized. I like games that are as sim as possible. You still have access to all the info you need, but when you want to see it, not in your face. 10. Personality! The game has lots of personality. When a buddy gets hit, he screams like someone who has just learned what it is to have hot bullets enter his body! The rag doll is pretty good. The animations are also pretty good in general. 11. Great weapon options! Plenty of kit choices, but not over the top. Great looking scopes, and realistic scope to eye time. Anyone who has ever put a scope to their eye will enjoy this. It's not instant. Also I loved the flashlights, they look really good, illuminate realisticly and are somewhat blinding if you are looking right into one. I can't go on enough anout how fun it was to be a masked bartender serving up Molotov coctalls to some thirsty PMC nerds camping in a window. Bottoms up! 12. The game runs great. I had few issues with it. in 7 hours play I had 2 freezes that recovered quickly. 13. The game looks good, but not so good that it smashes your GPU and runs like a slide show. All the important stuff is there. Good shadows, good animations, realistic smoke and fire (even ambient fire hurts), glass shatter animations. Also it sounds good all around, not just the guns as I mentioned before. 14. Throwing mo;otovs on security gaurds. I mentioned it before, but it bares repeating.  I really don't have any cons worth mentioning. New maps seem to be being added all the time, and there are already many. I liked every map I played so far. There are lots of players, lots of servers and this game has alot of life to give. If you love shooters, then this is a must have. It dosnt matter if you are into arcady or simulator because this game offers the best of both and everything in the middle. I get the feeling like the devs are really into playing shooters and decided to take the best parts of all the best shooters and forge 1 complete game that gives the server host all the options they need to find their particular sweet spot in options. For me this game has the one quality that is just an abosulte must. FUN. This game is really fun to play.",

There arnt many maps, or weapons, doesnt bother me much, the game is still under development.   For a tactical shooter, this is the best one i have played to date. Move slow and sneaky watching your mates back. Or rambo style and you will have shots fired at you from all directions. The rambo syle only sometimes pays off if the enemy is unaware you are in their territory. A combination of his style of play also works. The most inportant factor is to moove out covering each other every second. he maps are designed so there are no real camping spots. Always 2 or 3 ways into an area.   After some more development. They are going to add more weapons and more maps. The maps so far are all set in the middle east, insurgents vs americans....ALLAH O AKBAR!!...... COME GET SOME!!... If Matt reads this review there is nothing more fun than yelling allah snackbar, popping out from a dooway and full auto ak47, from the hip spreying bullets down the street at the americans with HP amunition. Watch em duck for cover, maybe get one with the sprey&amp;prey then prepare for the flanking of the enemy. In fact the hip shooting works quite well compared to most games, No crosshair only iron sights and scopes. Customization of weapons before start of the match lets u choose between a selection of items. You cannot have everything attached for example. If you have an m16 with a heavy barrel attached then the supressor option is removed.  My score for game so far = 8.9/10 After things are added the score only gets higher !

Weapons also deal realistic amounts of damage, so dont expect to survive more than a few rounds. The solo run-and-gun playstyle common in many FPS's won't work in Insurgency. If you want to stay alive and complete the objective, you almost always require teamwork.  And thanks to well-done sounds such as gunfire and richocheting bullets, it's also incredibly intense.  Visually, it may not compare to larger AAA titles, but for a source engine game, it looks fantastic.  All i could possibly complain about is the small number of maps.

I saw they released a standalone version and decided to take the plunge. For the price, I am very satisfied. The game itself blends elements of some well known FPS titles, i.e weapon customization, variety of well known game modes, etc. with Insurgency's own twist. The difference from other titles is gameplay. Think hardcore mode from Call of Duty (a couple of shots kill you, no standard crosshair, only iron sights for precise aiming, etc.) with more emphasis on teamwork, thanks to a variety of classes to choose and customize according to mission objectives, and built in VOIP support. This allows for some very fast paced and intense gameplay as you have to work with your team to capture/defend objectives, destroy/defend weapon caches, etc.   There is also a co-op mode which adds another dimension and pits you against swarms of AI that you have attack and defend against, according to your missions parameters. This makes for a welcome diversion from PVP and can help hone your skills and try out some class configurations.   I only hope that Insurgency team takes the approach of releasing new free content to expand the original game (more maps, weapons + attachments) as well as purchaseable DLCs. DLCs that include more maps, teams (i.e NATO countries, eastern european countries, Russia, Chechnya, etc. etc.) and associated weapons and attachments would give this game immense replayability and ensure healthy community growth for years to come.   As a stand alone game, I would recommend Insurgency to those looking for something more tactical than CoD or CS:S. I think the Insurgency team are on to a winner and once they iron out a few kinks and make some optimizations for gameplay, and provided they spice this game up with free and purchaseable DLC content, this game has potential to become a must have title for years to come.",

Co-op requires a lot of teamwork, and it's in this mode that I've had the best social interactions as well. In a lot of standard multiplayer matches you will often have people not talking at all, whether that's because they're all talking on Skype or some other VOIP service, I dunno, but it seems like people are happy just running around on their own. That's not to say the multiplayer isn't awesome, because it is, I'm just saying that co-op is especially great.

I have always favored tactical shooters over ones that encourage induvidual performance over team performance. Despite a few minor bugs (the floating guns being one of them), the game performs very well and the graphics are quite nice. There are many different game modes to choose from but all of them force you to appreciate the value of your life due to the amount of time you'll spend waiting to respawn or start a new round when you first start playing.   It does take a while to learn the maps and figure out where everyone loves to hide out and there isn't a killcam so don't get discouraged if you die constantly at first from unknown locations. There are not as many people playing this game as I would hope but there are a handful of active servers to play on that almost always have between 20 and 30 people online at any given time. I would recommend using the server browser to find a server that you like rather than the automated server selection system.   I could see the community growing for this game especially if there is a regular release of content to keep players interested as well as the addition of some kind of induvidual player progression. I play on a server with a ranking system which is more than enough to keep me interested but I imagine that most players will want some kind of progression so they feel as though they are working towards something while playing the game.   In conclusion, I'd say this game is a great alternative to CounterStrike: Global Offensive that offers a refreshing take on tactical shooters.

The game modes a ♥♥♥♥ing fun though and once you get some experience Insurgency proves to be a super addictive game.   The community is also pretty chill. Some d-bags roaming around but for the most part these guys are fun to play with.   To sum it up.

Getting rid of those brings more focus on the actual gun fights, which is more entertaining in my opinion. Matchmaking is abundant, game modes are plentiful, objectives are clear, and competition is fair. Choose a server, pick a team, assign your role, and decide your loadout, all whilst being immersed in an intense firefight; nothing more, nothing less. Only regret is not getting the 4-pack for my friends to join.

            "review_text": "I've put off writing a review for a long time, but today is a good day to finally write one. Think of where to start is hard, but i think the combat is as good a place. from the wide range of class on both sides many of the same guns will be in them, for example the ak-47, ak-74, m16, and m4a1, are found in almost all except for the sniper and recon classes. This isn't bad mind you because each are good gun, and the other guns in those classes are fun to play with as well, but clearly these are the guns that will be present on the battlefield the most. the suppression and damage mechanics make sense, usaully if you are pinned down with fire your screen becomes fuzzy, and if you are hut once or maybe twice, you are going to die. Recoil is realistic, aiming makes sense, and if you have a good reaction time you can hit what you shoot at. The community is what give this game such good memories in my mind though. When I first got picked up to play in this games upstart competitive tourny system I was a bit, how do I phrase it, ♥♥♥♥♥♥. The more i played with my team mates, the better I became. By the time our team broke up due to disaggrements with the DGL I was still not great, but i had clearly become better. I made many friends who I still talk too, and game with regularly a year and a half later. People that play the game today are for the most part very chill and very rarely will you get some asshat that comes into a go and starts ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ people off, which is nice to see. The dev team is also very cool, and if you ever get into a game with them you will figure out why I stated this. They bring fun updates every month or two, and manage to keep people interested in an amazing game.  So, I'd say if you are looking for a fun, cheap, team based game then insugency is the game for you.",

The recoil and sprinting and Aiming down sights is better than any other game I have played. it manages to be action packed and a tactical shooter all at the same time. The graphics arent great but for $15 its not bad. It also runs 100+ fps on ultra with only a 650 ti boost. there is no points system which adds to the realism. you choose your class and gun before each game. the classes are like the pick 10 system from BO2 but you can have any class/gun you want from the start. The maps are like a medium size battlefield maps but still have that close quarters feel. the only bad thing about the game is the connection issue and fake virus it downloads. if you have above 120 ping the game can be choppy. It has not dropped me from a game in 4 hours so that problem was fixed in the latest patch.

Bill is the first to go down, a shot to the temple...quick. Phil was not so lucky. He was shot in the leg and fell onto his arm, broke it on impact. I still remember his screams. I couldnt react as I saw all my friends fall before me. Next thing I know I am liying on the ground, wet red blood splattered across my face and next to me is someones foot...no wait, my foot. The horror seeing the black burnt flesh of my own foot made me throw up. After I roll to my left and see Dave looking at me with these dead horrible seeing eyes. He's dead. I can bearly make out strange voices that I dont understand. Four men with turpens wrapped across their face hover over me and stare with their AK-47's pointed at my head.

The wave system brings players back to the game (solving the Counter-Strike problem), yet still makes each life feel valuable, unlike other multiplayer FPS games.  As I'm not a weapons or military expert, I can't really attest to the realism of the weapons and gear on show or the general tactics and mechanics employed within the game, but it feels very much as it did on the original Insurgency mod.  I can highly recommend this game. However, the best experiences come if you find a decent server to play on with regulars. I'm not sure how many of the original maps made the cut into the release version of the game yet, but some of them are still pretty golden.",

Sure its a little rough around the edges still but theres the basis there for a very good game, the sounds are top notch, there's a good spread of playmodes and the maps are quite well ballanced. Also, I LOVE that there's no annoying leveling system which gives a massive benefit to leveled players. Weapon addon/selection works by giving you a set number of points, whether you choose to use those points on frag grenades, or armor peircing rounds for your weapon is up to you...  The graphics are nothing to write home about, but the weapon models are good, and the animations are also quite nice. I've had a few issues with hits not registering due to laggy servers / ping, so be warned that this game is currently VERY ping sensitive (as in try to play with a sub 100 ping).  If you're in the market for a smaller sized tactical shooter where 1-3 bullets will kill then insurgency may very well be for you.",

In that it does not intimidate with over-threatening control schemes or needlessly complex systems. Instead the game relies on its own realism to force the players on both sides to advance carefully, often together and slowly.  Its definately a game that would be suited to squad play, and the usage of smoke to block choke points etc is vital in certain situations, where what equipment one is armed with becomes vital. For example during one event I found myself pinned down in an alleyway by an enemy MG position, I threw a smoke grenade and ran AROUND the back of the alley, instead of rushing out. This was then followed by some super sneaky stealth stuff that made the navy seals look like clumsy junkies. After I'd made my secret flank thingy, I came up behind the Machine gunner who was deployed in a window, and took him out. This was followed by a rush of about 5 enemy troops from the next room who gunned me down within a half second of eliminating this MG. However thats the beauty of this game, it provides a rush and sense of satisfaction when you finally tag that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ wiping out half your team, and counter sniping is beautiful in and off itself, in short, its a game that should be on your top 10 buys this yaer.",

I bought this game at the start of the Steam sale and so far, I'm really enjoying it. It's made in the source engine so the netcode feels tight and the controls smooth. The graphics are surprisingly good thanks to some good texture work and character models and really nice use of HDR lighting. Stepping from a blinding sandy street into a darkened hovel is disorienting and scary as your eyes take a second to adjust.  The game has tonnes of different game modes but I've not played them all. I recommend Firefight if you are just starting out. In it there are three objectives. Each team starts with one and one is neutral. When you die you sit out but can respawn when an objective is secured by your team. You win by either killing all the enemy or (I think) securing all 3 objectives. The game is similar to CS in that there is no global unlock persistence but rather you earn supply points throughout a match that can be spent on weapon attachments, armour, explosives etc. At the end of the map cycle you start again with the base weapons.  It differs from Counter Strike though because the teams are split into a number of squads and each squad has a limited number of different class roles to be filled. Classes like Marksman, Sapper, Breacher each give you different starting load outs. I quite like this because it stops everyone from being the same class and generally stops the game getting dull with everyone being a sniper or whatever.  The gun mechanics are what really draw me to the game. They are similar to Red Orchestra with a small amount of float in the middle. It makes the weapons feel weighty and realistic and grounded in the game. In addition the game has lean, prone and a nifty cover system that automatically bumps your view up when looking over low cover through your iron sights.  It's an alpha but it's pretty stable. I've been dropped from the server a couple of times and it's frozen up when loading a map but so far no bugs of note at all.  The biggest issue with this game is the player count. It's actually grown quite a bit throughout the steam sale but there are still only a few players scattered across a few servers (it uses the Steam server browser which is a massive plus in my book). I've not yet had a problem getting into a busy server but I can see the play base disappearing if they don't get some publicity. They had a Kickstarter I believe but it didn't reach it's target - perhaps no one knew about it.  Anyway, I definitely recommend this game if you are interested in slightly more realistic military games with nice controls and no persistent unlocks.  [[EDIT]] The player count is looking a lot more healthy now with loads and loads of populated servers. Lets hope it stays that way.",

Great work New World Interactive!  ** Updated 11/13/14 **  Now that I've had this game for a while (not as much time played (60+)), but this is still one of my favorite FPS that instills teamwork. If you communicate (in-game or TS3,Vent) Insurgency is so much more enjoyable. There are a lot of groups out there who actively play, and communicate throughout each round. Don't get mad when you die, and don't care about your K/D (it doesn't get you anywhere in life). Work with your team/squad and you can easily win every game you play.

Sniping is enjoyable, bullets kill people with one shot. 1 shot from a sub- machine gun can kill somebody. Grenades are actually your best item. You will spend half you life checking corners and running through smoke on the chance that you wont get shot. IED's and C4 absolutely blow up everything known to man. You will actually take a weapon off automatic to single fire to improve your aiming. Machine guns are OP especially the M249. Hip firing takes skill and last but not least you will get killed by an RPG repeatedly. There is no killcam, thank god. Not to mention, INSURGENT weapons are not as good AS SECURITY weapons because REALISM. You will kill your teamates especially with explosives, but most people are generally friendly about it. HIGH PINGS GET KICKED, TEAM KILLERS GET KICKED.   CONS- You will get spawn camped but that is actually your team's fault for dying, abnoxious teammates that yell ALLAHU AKBAR or ALOHA SNACKBAR or every known interpretation of the saying all the time. That one RPG or AT4 that will kill everyone on your team ( Then annoying ALLAHU AKBAR all over mic). You will play with teamates who just play it like it's COD (People don't absorb bullets in this game). Then there are those guys who ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bag team kill.   ALLAHU AKBAR /10 would play again",

I played CS for 15 years now and I been playing a lot of other FPS games, HF, quake, COD, BF, wolfestien, dirtybomb, warface, warframe, borderlands, you name it, I probably had played it before.   This is one of the best strategic FPS out there in the current market. It is a unique experience compared to other FPS games.   Suggestions for developers:  If they can push the realism to next level, it will be the best strategic FPS in the market. I have hope for this game. I would want to see more variety of realistic firearms for starters. I want more personalized firearms, not just in skins.  let's say being limited to five sets of different primary firearm per role will be a good start.   Conclusion:   If you enjoy tapping &gt; spraying guns.  You enjoy practicing of game theory.   You happen to enjoy realistic FPS, situational and strategy based game, this is one of the best in the market you can get.",

Personally I like this game a lot: An excellent mix of CS and Red Orchestra, good old school fps that takes you very close to events. Everything happens in seconds and sometimes you simply couldn't see it coming. Own score isn't the priority nro. 1 but the teamwork. This is not ADHD CoD arcade where you can dominate alone, this is where you are doomed to lose if trying to solo too much, sometimes even a bit. And the other (a bit more experienced) players know it already. Graphics, sounds and especially the atmosphere is awesome with a great touch of teamworking. So for those who are looking somehing challenging,  team  playing based tactical fps, I think you have found what you are looking for! But if you are going to let others to do the objective meanwhile you stay behind, dont even bother to get this game, you probably will be kicked out every server because n00b playing.",

Free DLCs on top of it all from weapons, attachments, maps and game modes.   This is not the stereotypical Call Of Duty Halo shooter where run-and-gun tactics are acceptable. This is a game accentuated with mechanisms that clearly favor camping but with game modes that force you to play fast paced. Bullets, yes, can kill you in one hit. Life is a fragile thing and the game represented it well. This is the only multiplayer I've ever seen with accurate dynamic fire suppression mechanisms.  This shooter is a mix of a mind game and a skill shooting gaming. To be able to actually be GOOD at insurgency, you must know your environment and try to guess enemy movement.  Pros:  - Good feel to the guns - Incredible memorable maps - Incredible atmosphere - Multiple game modes - Surprisingly many players - Incredibly well optimized (Source engine) - Complex learning curve - Customization - Intensed methodical pacing - INCREDIBLE value - Raw and realistic combat - Free updates  Cons:  - Shotguns are incredibly lackluster and borderline useless. They damage reduction is way too strong on medium distances. - Netcode is awful. Always play in a server below 100 ping. (fixed somewhat now playable 100-150 range) - Dated visuals (although I'm not bothered by them) - Community is ♥♥♥♥ing annoying sometimes.

I really enjoy the challenging and realistic parts of it which is reminiscent of a FPS version of the Demon/ Dark Souls series. Yet, there are a couple of existing bugs and balancing issues that turn me off sometimes. Quite often while playing with my friends online, it just crashes (black screen) in middle of the game. Night time maps should be brightened to improve visibility and the AI with super human accuracy level should be nerved as well.  Bottom line: Regardless of the negatives, Insurgency is still a surprisingly fun and challenging game that I enjoy playing online with my friends. Really looking forward to future updates/ patches that will address the issues highlighted above.",

I would suggest buying this game for many reasons like the fact that this isnt all too much like the shooters out right now. This FPS doesnt include a radar and more importantly it makes sure you feel like you are in a warzone. You work with a pretty big team made of 2 squads and work to complete objectives. There are many types of gamemodes that you can play that require different tactics to get the job done most efficiently. Using real world tactics and strategies inorder to move from one room to another with out getting ambushed can be pretty fun. Still not feeling like its that competitive? The only other thing I can think of that gives the game an extra edge is that you never truely know if you killed your target and it is very possible that the 'enemy' that you killed was a teamate and it gets intense when you are alone in a quiet battlefield fighting an unknown ammount of enemies. Playing this game requires some quick thinking and skills. Would I suggest this game for people who are casual players? You could try it, but I would HIGHLY suggest that competitive players get this game.",

It's quick to jump right into a game, although as of now, there are only a few good servers which have low ping - being in Asia. Despite this it's still easy to get into a match and have fun. I have not played too much of the PvP game modes but the Co-op is extremely fun. I think it's the fact it's very easy to die, which makes survival and being tactical very important. You will not survive if you run around like a lunatic - which believe it or not, this can be done in a lot of FPS games nowadays. Continuing, the spawn system works perfectly, only being able to spawn if your team capture or complete an objective, this adds to the tension of the game. This game really strives to deliver an almost unparralled raw and realistic first-person shooter. Extra postives: Solid gun sounds, good gun related animations &amp; decent graphics. Negatives: Sometimes unstable when joining game but it is only temporary.   Tl;dr: Solid realistic FPS worth the money.   Update 1: July 7  I have since played more PvP game modes and have really enjoyed it, I think this game is gaining more and more players which is good.  One way I could see it improving is only through aesthetic customisation of your soldier, possibly a system which rewards unlocks from kills or experience. I say this because there's not too much to strive towards whilst playing but the most important aspect is already here: fun. If they could expand the game in that way I think it would be even better for people who love this game.",

Really runs your adrenaline, can be intense and exciting.  LIKED: Gun play felt realistic and fairly balanced. Sound effects were insanely detailed and believeable. Ministry and Sinjar are great maps, and Peak is very experimental. (Re)-spawning system was great, just needs spawn kill protection of some sort. Movement feels fast/tight, you can get to an objective, hunker down, lean out and maneuver easily. HUD stays out of the way.  DISLIKED: Spawn killing can get pretty bad on some maps. You can get completely stuck in some places of some maps. No leveling system.  SUGGESTIONS: Names of teammates should appear faster. More map variety. Plain old Deathmatch/Team Deathmatch modes? A few more weapons? Mines or some sort of claymore would be badass. Simple leveling system to add more points to the loadout system/unlock guns or maps? Blood or some indicator of a kill.  PRICE: Regular: 7/10 | Steam Sale: 9/10 ENTERTAINMENT: Singleplayer: 5/10 | Multiplayer: 9/10 OVERALL: 8.5/10  TL;DR: Buy it if it goes on sale or you LOVE tactical squad-based shooters. If you play with friends it is even better. Tight controls, realistic gameplay, and a decent map/player variety. Array of guns/maps/gamemodes is average, but you can't complain for $14.99!",

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.  Eat.",

Oooooooh yea)  ok now lets return to real world.(i mean review world)  Graphics. pretty yet realistic (well duuuuh).  has great visual effects (such as lights , fire ..... more fire .... oh and explosion *demo man* 'KABOOM')  The game. love how hip fire isnt realy the smartest move to do in this kind of games , because you dont have crosshair (and no if you take a paper and stick in on the screen that dosent mean your gonna have a crosshair thats good aim).  Being in cover and slowly watching ever side is the smartest thing to do (unless your crazy motherf#!@# who runs like kamikaze guy)  team works those it all (unless your realy good in the game ).  Out side of the game(in main menu actually). You have 2 things to choose first PVP or PVE - (co-op)  the game has lots of maps to choose (you can even dowload custom maps).    in pvp i think it has 5-7 mods to choose (as in team deathmach . capture the flag ( i think) . protect vip (something) , plant the bomb . and so on (i think) ).   in pve you have 4-5 mods to choose ( hunt , capture , sabotage (i think) , and so on ).  My suggestion is to buy the game when on sale (cause its not a ordinary Fps game so there chance some fps player wont like it).",

            "review_text": "Insurgency is relatively realistic. It looks like a Ken Burns documentary compared to Call of Duty’s and Battlefield’s more Hollywood approach. For one thing, your screen isn’t filled with information. You have no health bar, no compass, no map, and no aiming reticule. Flashy text doesn’t congratulate you after every kill.Without it, Insurgency looks cleaner and more authentic than its peers, letting you focus on strategy and action instead of keeping track of an enemy’s location on a minimap in the corner of the screen.Insurgency also doesn’t have a lot of the flash you see in modern shooters.At first glance, you’ll want to compare Insurgency to Counter-Strike. Both are competitive, team-based shooters that pit terrorists against counter-terrorist forces, but the two play differently. While you only get one life per a round of Counter-Strike, most game modes in Insurgency permit you to revive your entire team if you complete an objective, like capturing a certain point on the map or destroying a weapon cache.This dynamic provides for some fun comebacks.Insurgency offers roles like demotion, sniper, and recon, but you can’t necessarily be whatever you want. Each match offers a set number of slots for each class. The available loadouts change depending on the map and mode you’re playing. Since Insurgency is so much more realistic than most shooters, it’s also a good deal more complicated and less forgiving.Also, you won’t find any sort of training or single-player mode, so your only option if you want to improve is to jump into some online matches and suffer through some punishment. Insurgency was originally a Source-based mod, but this standalone release still uses the almost 10-year-old game engine. As a result, Insurgency isn’t the most-detailed game, with a lot of textures looking flat and dated. Ultimately, Insurgency is going to win fans for its gameplay. The action is highly competitive and focused.Sure, it doesn’t have the flash that most shooters proudly throw at your face these days, but Insurgency’s quieter, more realistic, and tenser take on modern warfare deserves a look, especially if you’re tired of instant knife kills and exploding buildings.",

            "review_text": "I really am enjoying the game thus far. It has a large number of game modes all which really force you to work as a team. Your goal is to win, not to get as many kills as you can by yourself. The game tries to focus on realism, with no HUD aside from teamate designation and capture point info, and nearly every weapon in the game killing in 1-2 hits if aimed precisely. The maps for the most part are well designed and the night versions of the maps give them an interesting twist. The only gripe I could have with this game is that a big part of doing well has to do with map knowledge and that takes a bit to get acustomed to. I would recommed playing the 'push' gamemode to start as it lets you learn the map in chunks over and over again, rather than having the whole map open to try and learn. The community for the most part is pretty welcoming and not littered with 10 year olds. Overall I really enjoy this game and would recommend it to anyone who wants a satisfying multiplayer shooter experience. I picked it up for $6 on sale so if youre still holding back just wait until it goes on sale. Well worth it.",

Do you want attachments on your primary, or have a seconday weapon just in case? What about body armor? These are the kinds of decisions you will have to make, and it really does keep things fair. In additon to competitive multiplayer, Insurgency has a fantastic co-op mode. Working together is key and it breaks the mold of your typical run-and-gun shooters. One of Insurgency's best assets is that it makes you feel vulnerable (but not to the point where it's unforgiving). Running from cover to cover is key as is leaning around corners so you don't give the enemy too easy of a target. The game feels solid so far, even though it is in early access.

One of my favorite things about this game is the absence of a profile that logs your K:D (though there is probably some way to check it that is unknown to me!) You don't have levels and there is no sense of ranking up in the game. Ther are special loadouts for each particular class, generally with four different weapons to choose from and assorted attachments for said weapons. This game is pretty realistic for a game, none of that CoD B.S.! One shot is lethal, you don't have to empty your whole freaking clip into a seemingly invincible enemy. You have to be careful, just running and gunning won't cut it, the game takes teamwork to new level. The current maps are fun and offer great gameplay!

This is in contrast to game like CS:GO where you are a bullet sponge by real-world standards and can turn on someone shooting you in the back. The variety of modes is good for keeping things fresh even if some of them are just a minor variation of another. I also have to give credit to the sound designer. The cracks and thuds of rounds are terrifying when the battlefield silence is broken with one.  The only gripe I have about this game is the community.

            "review_text": "Modern Military Shooter that feels like an alternate present day where tactical team based first person shooters reigned.   **How I found this game by rage alone is at the bottom  I have been a huge fan of Rainbow Six since it launched in the 90s straight through when they stopped making Rainbow Six games in 2004 and I've got to say... Insurgency is making me feel really good right now. I had forgotton how satisfying it is to have a plan and excecute it.   This game isn't Team Survival-centric like Rainbow Six 3, but the way that respawns are incorporated into the game makes sense. There's nothing wrong with having respawns as long as the way the game plays encourages you to make the most of the first (and potentially the only) life you have. In Insurgency, your team can earn a 'wave respawn' if you complete an objective. So, if you are the only man alive you can resurect your whole team by taking down a control point. The control points are spaced out so you'll have to respect the possibility of not respawning at all and play smart. This IS NOT a run in there as the star player and win the game for your team type of shooter. You'll need the help of your sniper to pick off targets in the distance while your support gunner lays down covering fire... all while not feeling like your role is shoe horned in.  Speaking of roles... I'm sure we've all seen a video where someone's whole team was camped up on a rock a million miles from the objective pretending they're helping, right? Well, in Insurgency only one player can play each available role. That means you have a list of 'jobs' to pick from before the round starts and that job will have a specific loadout by default. That can be changed within reason, but you will be expected to play that role... so demolitions expert... BRING C4. That also means that if there's one spot for a 'sniper' then you'll never have more than one 'sniper.' It also means that people who want that role can't hide behind the fact that they are one of a million snipers... they are all you've got... so they better be mixing it up and helping the team. In my first 10 or so hours with the game... that was the case.  Customizing gear comes with a system of points with each option for your gun/gear having a point value between +0 and +4 (from what I can remember). That means if you ditch your +1 side arm you can put a +1 heavy barrel on your M16. You can bring heavy armor, but you may have to ditch the holographic optics to do so. Each class has weapons/gear that are specific to that class and some others that can be carried across all classes. Everyone I've seen can carry a frag grenade, but a rifleman can't carry C4 (IIRC) no matter how many points he has available. Get it?   Basically, this is a MODERN FPS with OLD SCHOOL roots. It really does feel like the direction I thought games were going in during the early 2000s. It's all the stuff I liked with a ton of new stuff I'm falling in love with quickly. When people mention 'old school' or the like they normally mean that all the comforts and upgrades that have come about in the last few years are gone. That's not the case here. If you're coming off your thousandth hour of Battlefield 4 or Call of Duty: Ghosts you'll be right at home... you'll just need to adjust to the MENTALITY of an old school shooter. In Insurgency you're no longer the army... you're a part of a team.  **The title 'Insurgency' plus the trailor PLUS the promotional artwork they have posted made me think this game was some political message piece where you play as the 'insurgents' vs what appears to be US troops. It really didn't sit well with me so I went and checked out some gameplay videos to see if my feels was reals. Turns out they just have no idea how they are coming across (to me at least). The game IS NOT what I thought it was at all. In fact, when I heard the developer talk about the way the game plays and how his coop mode is inspired by 'Terrorist Hunt' on Rainbow Six it went to immediate buy status.",

There's a host of modes for competetive MP, all objective based. And a Co-Op mode which has you progress from one end of a level to the other, capturing objectives, defending against counter attacks, and blowing up ammo caches. A defensive hoarde mode (last I knew) is in the works as well.  I'd recommend this to fans of the mod, of Red Orchestra, and perhaps America's Army as well.",

CONS- server stuttering, player icons not showing up sometimes (friendly fire), hit detection seems off sometimes (could go hand in hand with server issues), no ranking or stat system (play for fun)  Keep in mind this is a hardcore shooter and not your run and gun type game, 1-3 bullets drops you.

The two games share an engine, both running on source, so it will run on nearly any hardware.  The game is set up in a few different modes, that range from 32 player firefights to 6 player Co-op vs. bots and everything in between. Most game modes center upon playing the objectives, rather than just going for kills, but certain modes are very kills oriented for those who are interested. Teamwork is very important, as is carrying out your squad role. The learning curve isn't steep and there are plenty of skins and customizations in the workshop to get things tuned the way you like them.  The community is pretty good, from what I've come across, and people are good at helping new people on the more casual servers. Every once in a while, you can get on a team with trolls and that can really ruin a game, but it isn't to hard to switch servers, and trolls are infrequent.  The game is still being actively developed at the time of writing, and sometimes they introduce new glitches or change the feel of things just a bit, not always for the better, but the bugs are usually fixed again quickly. A new build on a new engine is said to be coming, so that may be interesting. I hope that it is Source 2, but I don't think they have said.  I'd definitely recommend the game to FPS fans or CS:GO players looking for a different feel. Lots of fun to be had, and great team work to enjoy.",

Anyways, I'd give this game 9.5/10 and highly recommend this game to anyone who wants something a little different from CSGO or ARMA.

However, this game emerged out of a mod and is without a doubt the most complete and impressive alpha I have seen. The jist of my review is this, if you enjoyed counterstrike source, you will most likely find this a worthy successor. It meets counterstrike's tactical gameplay with meticulous projectile physics and the 'advancements' in modern fps...ses halfway. Considering what's on offer, $15 seems like a more than fair price to me, if it were ever on sale for less it would be a steal.  The visuals aren't breathtaking, but they certainly get the job done and communicate a bleak atmosphere. The sound design is quite good, the crackle of gunfire is satisfying and each gun produces a unique sound. The controls are pretty standard fare. The level design on the maps is pretty good, though there are occasional balance issues depending on the game mode.  Insurgency does have flaws, there are bugs- perhaps the most notorious of which is crashing during explosions, but the devs seem on top of them. Running into walls or other obstacles seems to get you 'stuck' occasionally, and sometimes there are strange shapes or movements that can be distracting. However, most of these seem like minor things that need ironing out, and not structural problems.  For fans of CS, I can't recommend this enough. For me at least it recaptures the unique tactical firefights and pace of counterstrike in a sleeker more modern package. Anyone looking for a big budget, graphical powerhouse of jingoistic testosterone full of cinematic setpieces and vehicles and such, keep walking.    ",

Up to 16 man teams of Marines and Insurgents face off in various game modes, including CTF, Skirmish (point capture, players only respawn once their team captures another point) and Push (attackers gain reinforcements for successfully assaulting objectives). The key to Insurgency's charm being it ruthless lethality, and immediate resolution of the game at the depletion of one team's reinforcements. Think modern Red Orchestra, but with Counter Strikes map design and equipment model.  Presentation: A blood-pumping heroic score graces the menu, and somber or heroic resolution themes get your morale up for the next match, or aide in your subsequent defeat. I like it. Bullets snap past your face, dust puffs up, explosions rip through buildings with a trembling roar. The ecstatic shouts of the accurate and chilling screams of the slain ring out as the thrum of a firefight rolls across the map. Graphically, you can tell Insurgency was formerly a source mod. Building and terrain textures are perfectly passable, but 'this ain't Crysis'. Night maps have superb lighting, and tracers are appropriately bright and harrowing. It might not be a looker, but the sound design more than makes up for it's mediocre graphical fidelity. Character models are likewise passable, and the surprisingly beautiful mountain and farm battlefields are offset by brown and muddy waddis and urban hellholes. We're here to shoot things, not to admire walls.   Gameplay: The true meat of an FPS experience. Each team uses points to select factions specific equipments, allowing for surprising diversity but still thankfully reigned in on the side of authenticity. Support gunners can forgo extra ammo belts for heavy armour, or by spending extra points, equip carbines. Assaulters can forgo pistols in favor of extra grenades or attachments for their rifles. Interestingly, the factions are clearly different. The Insurgents only have access to Soviet-era weapons and special explosives, while the Marines have advanced body armour and accurate weapons. Movement is fluid, made more so by a slide when ending sprints. However, slow cautious gunplay is the best strategy. Bullets are near 1 hit kills, so suppressing fire by LMGs quickly must be met by smoke to avoid random casualties. Most engagements are exchanges of fire at around 50-100 meters, with occasional rockets and grenades breaking holes in mostly clearly defined battle-lines. Armour-less and suppressor equipped scouts attempt flanking maneuvers, while shotgun and flashbang laden breachers clear the apartments, as hulking combat infantry and gunners slowly advance down the chaotic streets below. Battle is a complex dance, with perceptive squad leaders issuing suppressive fire and movements orders, and the rough-and-tumble infantry just enjoying the intense and nerve-wracking chaos of combat. Insurgency is tactical, authentic and intense.   Technical: Source mod, you know what to expect. I never dipped below 60 fps, in the most intense gunfights with all settings set to ultra.   As someone who wanted a tight and deadly close quarter FPS, Insurgency is perfect for me. Anyone wanting the no-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t '1 hit and out' gunfights coupled with traumatic and frantic twitch accuracy combat will absolutely enjoy this FPS experience. Well worth the cheap price of entry.",

This game isn't your ordinary 'military shooter' no, this is far better. This game has the strategy and tactics of an Arma game, but plays out like Battlefield. The online community is pretty good, but I have ran into some asshats. The realistic feel to this game is what amazes me. There is no hud whatsoever so you need to rely on pure guessing (unless you count every bullet fired.) You really feel victorious when you win a match or get a kill. I forgot to mention the health system. The health system in this game really is not forgiving, one to three shots is all it takes so be careful. A word of advice, stay in cover, don't go prancing around the map COD style. This game really suggests you stay behind cover or your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ will be jammed with bullets. The graphics are nothing special, but the gun detail is amazing, each shot you fire off has smoke and hot gas come out of the muzzle, you can see the scratches and notches in the weapons. Soundwise this game is eargasm worthy to me. Put on some headphones and you will feel that the bullets flying through the air are actually coming towards you. The crack of bullets, the explosions, the random allahu ackbar through the mic all make this a better game. Animations can be a little wonky at times, but they make you laugh so I don't mind it. If you like gritty, realistic shooters this is the game for you. If you don't like waiting for the next reinforcement wave and/or easily rage, this is not for you.

Let's look at all the content this $15 game gives you: Countless maps(with more coming) Several awesome and balanced guns(with possibly more coming further down the line) Online PvP Online PvE Offline PvE Tonnes of gamemodes(with occasional additions of new game modes) Legal Workshop mods  Let's not forget that the PvP and PvE modes are almost two entirely different beasts in this game. In PvP you have to face other players, using advanced tactics and teamwork to outsmart your enemies to win in a game where map knowledge and tactics are key. While PvE deals with 4-12 players(and more on custom servers) facing off against VERY SMART bots in several different game modes different from PvP. That's right, both PvP and PvE have their own unique set of game modes to give more content!   PvE may sound pretty easy, but I assure you the bots are not stupid by any means. They are easily the smartest bots of any shooter I've played. They know how to take cover, retreat, fight in groups, pre fire, how to properly place grenades and rockets, how to locate gunshots, and more! These AI are almost as good as other human beings playing the game. It makes for a load of fun and challenging missions, often times leaving a more rewarding victory than PvP modes.   Finally, the thing that gives this game even MORE content: making the game truly yours through workshop mods. Yes, almost all workshop mods are available for use in PvP and PvE modes(player model changes can only be used in PvE however). You can apply gun camos, player camos(to clarify, camos are allowed in PvP, but not changes to the models themselves), sight remodels, and even gun replacements. For example, you can 'replace' the AK-74 with the AK-12. Or you can make your Security team soldiers have a US Navy SEAL camo. Let's not forget sound mods! Yes, sound mods are in the game as well. I recommend the realistic sound mod and the all-time Classic 'Allahu ackbar' mod, which makes Insurgents scream the phrase when throwing explosives.   So as anyone can see, this game is a boatload of fun, and it truly gives far more to the player than any other game I've played. No microtransactions, not a lot of misbalance, good optimization, and most decent rigs can run it. If you're into shooters, especially more tactical and realistic ones, then you'd be a fool not to buy this game.   11/10.",

            "review_text": "i like this game a lot. very realistic gunplay, a lot of fun, great customization but as always i have gripes!  1) enemy AI vs friendly AI-no contest, your friendlies are dumb as bricks, standing in the open, not firing at enemies 3 feet in front of them while getting shot by them, not covering me at all, basically dont rely on them and have them die ALL THE TIME. enemy AI will flank, use strategic points, surround you and pin you down, they will also be as cheap as possible to kill you like use RPGs and grenades. they are also super numerous and they know it rushing you with 15-20 men at a time and you frantically run out of ammo trying to kill them all as the last man standing. devs spent a TON of time on the enemy and 0 time on friendly   2) attachments not for all the classes-i always want an m16/m203 with a red dot and suppressor. its good for every situation. they wont allow the supressor or grenade launcher for all classes so you must pick one or the other. about 80% of attachments are in every class but special ones are class specific which is kinda lame since there are already gun variations and gun barriers to begin with. like the grenadier class cant get a saw+rockets? like wtf. the argument of balance is thrown out the window when a rifleman and a grenadier get access to the same kit.....side note, the grenade launcher range sights are not on the side for the m16 or m4, they are on the top rail between the forward and rear carry handle/sight. they only exist on the side for the gp-25 on the ak47 and ak74u.  3) modding/weapon selection- this modding community is amazing, one of the best ive seen in my experiences, tons of stuff. the issue i have with it is the NEW weapons they offer are only replacements. come on devsss let them add stuff not replace!!!! its free content creation for your game, if you ever want to add the new weapons to the game its a simple, pay them for the model and boom implemented. for instance i would like to have the ACR in my game but having it replace the m4 in the game just isnt fun cuz then id have to unsub from the mod if i want to use the m4 again.   overall i still like the game 7.5/10",

            "review_text": "Insurgency is the game I've been waiting for since I began gaming, certainly in FPS games. As a (until a couple of years ago) a COD console gamer (yes I know) I had several problems with most FPS games. I like the realistic, brutal games they can be, but rarely ever are, as COD went downhill after MW3, Battlefield tries to be realistic while maintaining a quick respawn and points system, and CSGO has the typical valve idea of no ADS or sprinting, which detracts from the game.  Gameplay- 9/10 Hyperrealistic with no crosshair, no dumb dive to prone, realistic aiming speeds and maintaining some peripheral vision as you would aiming down a real scope. Some emphasis on teamwork as it has a hotkeyed menu of squad commands etc that can be used while moving, which is handy when you can get pinned down after you remember you can't lone wolf take out the entire enemy team. Good bullet damage, and no exaggerated ballistics I hated in BF4. Maybe a little added ballistics and bullet penetration thru materials, though not the COD 'shot thru a 5 inch brick wall' style. Guns actually have realistic mechanics, so no more sprinting down the map sniping with a pistol.  Loadouts- 10/10 Unique loadout system where you pick a class on match start, and each class has a pick of certain guns, E.G. snipers can pick from 3-4 snipers and DMRs, Recon from 4-5 SMGs and shotguns etc. You can then equip attachmens, sidearms, levels of armor/ammo packs and grenades but are restricted by your number of 'tokens' and your total carry weight. More items= more firepower/armor/ammo, but slower running speed and less stamina. No OTT weapon stats so instead of picking a gun based on bar charts you pick it on how good you actually are with it, so a bit of a learning curve for the first 3ish matches while you find your favouites but thats adds to realism. Decent grenades to pick from, as you get smoke, frags, molotovs and C4. I would like a proximity mine, though for a high price 'cause those things can be a ♥♥♥♥♥. Also, grenades differ slightly depending on your team, E.G. insurgents get IEDs while security forces get C4. Good attention to detail, because seriously, when was the last time you saw a terrorist *cough* sorry 'insurgent' with serious military hardware? No progression/ unlock system most FPS games seem to use, which may seem like it detracts from the sense of achievement, but I feel just got in the way of the game.  Maps- 9/10 Varying map sizes from COD small AF size to huge BF style maps, which can be restricted down for gamemodes needing smaller combat areas, or dynamically changing to open up more areas/shutting off areas when objectives are completed. Good map design so sniping actually feels worth it while other close range soldiers can also fight in more built up areas without worrying every five seconds if a sniper is gonna no-scope them thru 3 houses and a dog, You also get matches at night on the same maps, where the underbarrel torch gets really handy or you can get some useful toggle-able nightvision goggles, which again are realistic as you can be blinded by torches and your in-game 'eyes' take a moment to adjust to the NVGs.  Matches- 10/10 Loads of different (mainly objective based) game modes which are hosted on servers that, unlike other games, there is always a server open for a game you like with a decent amount of player (usually full or missing 1-2 players). Very good lobby sizes with 2 squads of about 8 men on each team (so 16 men on each team). Very good 'respawn' mechanism as once you die you wait for the next wave of reinforcements and then respawn as a different soldier but using the same loadout. Good match lengths, as they end when you run out of reinforcement waves, when you complete all the objectives or when the (lengthy) timer stops, so you don't have to rush around worrying about the match ending before you can get a decent kill count. There are also solo and coop game modes which are very well made, with every coop enemy AI being a serious danger, instead of a vague annoyance like other games. Again high emphasis on objectives which will pose a challenge. I haven't done much solo, but it has a tutorial mode, with a bit of a twist.  Decent DEVs which release free updates and will listen, though the updates aren't all the time which I like as the game has no real bugs I've found so the updates are more like DLC map packs, only free. Other FPS game developers need to think about cheaper DLCs that are actually decent new material, not just reskinned maps from previous games for 15 pound. Lookin at you Treyach/Activision.  As I said, this game is near perfect for my tastes, so anyone who likes the more realistic side of FPS, or big team games. or just games you can use to ♥♥♥♥ off the COD kids because it actually needs some skill, then look no further- 9/10, because I generally don't give 10/10 until I know the game back to front, whereas I've only played about 12 hours.",

The answer depends on what you are looking for:  A casual arcade experience: Call of Duty A team-based (still casual) experience: Battlefield  An ultra-realistic experience: Arma III A competitive experience: CS:GO A visceral, PTSD-inducing experience: Red Orchestra 2  If you want aspects of everything above, get Insurgency. Casual enough so you can just jump right into the action, but realistic enough to make you cringe everytime you see a squadmate die.   This game is worth so much more than you will buy this for.

The game is still under active development and gets new maps, patches and updates that also keep it interesting to play over a prolonged period of time.  The developers are also active in the community and have a weekly 'happy hour' (not really called happy hour, but it does make me happy ;-)) in which you can play with (or against) them and give them feedback on the game, which is awesome because they really listen to the players.

I am; and I'm proud to say this game is hardcore, and not in a buzzwordy way. When you are getting fired at in Insurgency, you will surely know it; from the particle effects when a round impacts and object to the not-very-over-the-top blur (I can barely call it blur but it is there), this game has a tendency to make me jump when I hear an unexpected crack as a round whizzes by my head, or (when playing versus AI) when I hear a friendly soldier yell out 'RPG RPG!', Insurgency is very immersive-while from a technical stand point Insurgency isn't very impressive, from a gameplay perspective it is absolutely astonishing. The game excels in it's Player versus Player, providing a unique and entertain experience, for example: I had just finished a game (we lost) and as per usual, players talked trash or congratulated one another over VOIP (note that it was friendly, sportsman like trash talk- not 10 year old Xbox trash talk). The next game proceeded to start and the teams had been switched around, but I noticed one of the more confident players from the VOIP at the end of the game was on the other team-I didn't think much of it at the time. Then mid-way through the match I am slowly creeping up a staircase to an objective past a few friendly dead bodies when I hear: 'Yeah, it's clear.' -That guy... again... I love proximity (♥♥♥♥ spelling) voice chat! Especially when I can hear my enemy! Back to the story... i heard 'Yeah, it's clear.' and in a foolish yet unique and fun turn of events pressed my push-to-talk key and exclaimed: 'Or is it?' Turns out I killed one and then got taken out by VOIP guy... Next game VOIP guy and I are on the same team, versus his friends on Teamspeak. Long story short: the community is pretty cool.   Pros:    prox. voice chat to all players*   immersive   WEAPON HANDLING 10/10   grade A particle effects   community is nice**   sound assets are fantastic   low system specs   perpetually high frame rate***   '1-shot' type hit to kill ratio   no HUD   night is DARK    Cons:    graphical fidelity is sub par   linear level design****   sitting out entire rounds on death*****   *Please note that there is also chat to your entire squad (1-3 usually 2 per team) it just combined with the prox. chat **Please note that this statement is entirely subject to change, is subjective, and may be different based on your experience ***Note this is dependant on your hardware and the settings you run the game on.Additionally note that there are some problem areas ****while the maps offer multiple angles and what not, either the objective is constantly contested or one side to the point that some maps always have the same outcome *****Depending on how you play, what gamemode you play, and your team",

Getting back into the server after this, you have a virtual seizure with mutliple repeating gunshot sounds before you can load in. These are the things I don't like about Insurgency.   Here's what I actually DO like and why I recommend this game:  1. Realistic weaponry and terrain. 2. Teamwork is a must here - know your role and what is required of you.  3. If you get stuck and/or tired on the same server, go to another one - I have discovered entirely new battle modes and maps by jumping around.  4. You can mute people that, in the nicest way I can put it, NEED to be silenced.  4a. There are silenced weapons :P 5. The price - was something like $15 brand new, and it goes on sale quite often. Even if it's full price that 15 bucks is worth it. 6. PVP and Co-op missions, with variable difficulty for AI. 7. It's actually fun.  I am not the best guy in the world to do reviews, but this game, so far, is a keeper. ",

Its slow pased when not in battle but once you hit combat your adreniline rushes and it becomes really fast paced. It's a hardcore FPS so any COD fans should stay away. There is no radar, hp meter, or ammo meter. There also isn't a kill cam which keeps you on the edge of your seat, checking every corner to find that person. The gamemodes are fairly basic and usually revolve around the same concept. This game is fairly difficult and you wont be getting long killstreaks. Insurgeny is a good example of what new FPS's should be.(insurgency isnt new, it started as a mod for HL2). I highly recomend this to any competitive FPS fan or Tactical FPS fan. I give Insurgency a 8.5/10.",

Just tons of fun!  Cons: Hitscan bullets (I always prefer bullets to have realistic ballistic properties) I get hung up on doorways, etc a lot.

There is a large selection of guns for either team (obvious things like AK's for Insurgents and guns beginning with M for security) with a great amount of customisation. There are specific classes which can carry what guns and items and you get supply points which stop you from loading up like rambo. It's a very goodsystem for equipment but if you're one of those guys who thinks that being patient and covering an objective (n00b camping for all you CoD fanboys) is stupid you're also gonig to die very quickly. The player base in generally very good (except the occasional idiot who shouts 'allah ackbar' after every insurgent win) and willing to work as a team which is very refreshing and enjoyable comparing to a lot of other games in which my teammates and enemys have had sexual relations with my mother and in which I'm gay for my other family members (don't forget the classic 'brush your teeth you British ♥♥♥'). Teamwork is critical in this game, a team who is mature and cooperative will beat any other team 9 times out of 10.

Also helps when one can identify the enemy &amp; react swiftly to neutralise them without dying yourself.   For those that have had enough of the normal trend of 'Hey, look!

OR, you can do horribly, Dying every left turn you take, and when you decide to go right, you still die. There is no turn around, no back, just forward.  The game itself: Insurgency is an addicting game. The graphics are wonderful, giving you something to look at whilst you shoot and kill people for you own fun and enjoyment. You will find yourself firing your weapon to just hear it, and your reasoning is will probably be understood by your teammates around you. The Grenades are spot on, and the weapon models are designed to perfection. Although the game has a few bugs here and there, they are far and few.  The annoying yet still fun part of the game: Your spawn-in can go three ways: A. You walk/run peacefully out of spawn B. You take fire whilst running out of spawn(Because trust me, you WILL be running) Or C. You will die.   Your teammates, usually, are well receiving of 'Noobies' to the game, although try not to go Team Killing MLG because they will try to kick and ban you. The actual battle(In longer words, you run through a cornfield thinking you are safe and hidden, and then you reach the middle and you get shot/blown up/cooked) can be intense or slow. One side will take the bad, and the team members will die left and right, and the other will get many kills and less deaths. The Spawn-in system is by wave, and you, of course, have a limited amount of waves. But when you take an objective you receive extra waves and time, on both attacking and defending sides(Depending on what mode you are playing, which there are many).  Overall, This is a great game and believe many others would enjoy it aswell, and it worth much more than what it is currently priced.  11/10 Would run through that cornfield again  12/1 Would go MLG team killing again",

Team work is a huge part in this game. And on the same coin, you have to be quite, for enemies can hear you talk if you get close enough. But with all this, you have both players who wanna take it seroiusly and players who don't want to. All in all, good game.",

I grew my teeth on Counter Strike and now play Americas Army: Proving Grounds and would put this somewhere in the middle.

Customization is perfect as u dont need to unlock anything, you just use how every many points the server allowa to create your loadout. For instance a sight might be 2 points and u might onlu have 1 because you customized other things. It is put in the slow paced shooter category and in your first few days of playing you may only get 1 or 2 if not no kills in a whole match or round. But its still a very enjoyable experience, running towards an enemy object when all of assounden enemy heavy gun fires sprays down as u go prone and suppress fire, running through a smoke cloud with squad members praying you don't run into an enemy, capturing and objective while you have snipers, assualts, and LMGs covering you and your squad, and much much more.

It's not perfect by any means and obvious areas that can be improved, but let's just say this game can scratch that hard to reach itch so many other FPS's just never seem to be able to reach because they are too caught up being busy signing autographs at their photo shoots at the awards ceremony and planning on their next PR angle. So on with it already!!!  It's Back!!!!...... Better Graphics, slightly different feel from original mod, but all the best parts and fundamentals are there.   Teams’ selection and load kit implementation is, I guess a necessary evil to be able to be competitive to pacify the BF and COD crowd, but overall pretty good.   My favorite part is jumping into a game and everyone on the other team (we had all speak on so I could hear them talking) ^@!%^ in their pants when I started taking them out and they never saw me coming. So much fun. People literally screamed when I would just come out of nowhere unexpectedly and drop them. I loved it when they tried to move and they realized they made a mistake and I saw them. They would suddenly yell 'Oh my god...He spotted me!! Run!!!'. Just friggin hilarious. None of this 'Ok, let’s strap on the body armor and call in air support with satellite drones and heat sensors and take this dude out. It creates instead a natural human instinct....Run...run or die.   Be honest with yourself. When was the last time you played COD or BF just to have an absolute blast? No really? Not to grind, 'level up', cap out, hit the high score, or to earn some achievement....just to go and have some real fun?  I've played BF and COD and they’ve got nothing like insurgency's ability to make a player AFRAID. In BF and COD, a player tends to get the 'invincible' mentality and feel like you are a war god or something. Drones, air support, helicopters, armor, health kits, battle tanks, 4gaziillion power scopes, etc. Run and Gun and re-spawn....No big deal after a while. I mean come on people! Radar showing you where every player in the map is? For Petes sake people do your eyeballs have a on screen indicator that flashes red in the exact direction the bullet comes from? I mean that’s cool and all, but that right there is what kills the REAL. I find where someone is by the direction the blood of the guy in front me splats. How's that for real?   COD and BF have too much to do in them. Level up, get dog tags, prepare for an airstrike, blah, blah. All in all, it ends up taking away the one thing you actually came to play for.......War. They focus too much on gadgets. Anyone that has ever been in a real firefight can tell you, all that high tech crap goes out the door when you have to start laying down some serious lead just to survive. That is where Insurgency shines. No frills, no super fancy-smancy bells or whistles, no leather appointed interiors. Just you, your team, the weapon in your hand (can you say IRONSIGHTS anyone) and a kill zone around you with your buddies dead and bleeding in front of you and you don't have a DAMN clue who or where they got hit from.   Since there are none of those 'AAA' game gadgets to distract you, you can actually focus of being more into the environment. The sounds of the enemy breathing behind you and the bullets whizzing and ricocheting around and suppression, footsteps and voices just start to rack on your nerves physically and eventually your mind mentally. It becomes viseral somehow. Not like some horror survival thing or Zombies, or anything like that, but just somehow manages to tap into the fear that you are 1 second away from dying and one single mistake and you are going to be watching someone walk over your dead body and no, they aren't there to 'get your tags', they just wanted to make sure you were dead.",

            "review_text": "Refreshing &amp; much needed shake up to the FPS genre. A cocktail of Counter-Strike, Arma, CoD &amp; Battlefield all rolled into one game making it potentially enjoyable for anyone willing to try to give the game a proper chance.  Let me weigh the game up with pros &amp; cons from my perspective for those on the fence about trying Insurgency.  Pros:  - Bullet Damage/Behavour: This game plays quite like an Arma game in the sense that everything tends to operate fairly realistically. You won't be running down the middle of an open road like Rambo, tanking bullets from 4 or 5 guys firing at you like you would in say softcore Call of Duty. 1 or 2 shots depending on the range &amp; calibre of weapon is enough to take you down. It doesn't mean you can't rush in the game, all that it means is that you'll have to be more clever with how you approach your rush. It is hardcore in every sense of the word.  - Weight system/fatigue: Again, draws on the Arma system that if you sprint for 30 seconds then immediately try to aim, it's going to take you a few seconds to compose &amp; steady yourself. The gear you select &amp; it's weight decides how quick you can move, how quickly you can become tired (ie needing time to recover to steady your scope) &amp; how protected you are. You can drop your heavy vest, meaning you'll be able to move quicker, but it will also mean that you may not survive that 1 shot to the chest.  - Shooting mechanics: Very solid, it's hard for me to even name a game that they are similar to. It feels like it has elements of Battlefield, Arma &amp; even Call of Duty &amp; CS (except obviously in this game you can aim down the sight with all weapons).  - Tactics: Very good once more, I've played maybe 10+ multiplayer games &amp; 10+ Co-op games as of right now &amp; on every single one there were people on their mics communicating with each other to achieve whatever the goal might have been. Very reminiscent of how people play Counter-Strike &amp; Arma in particular.  - Game modes: A lot of good &amp; enjoyable game modes that will suit people trying to play coming from any other FPS shooter I can think of. You've got modes similar to S&amp;D, Domination, HQ etc.  - Weapon/Gear Customisation: A variety of attachments &amp; ammunition changes available from the second you fire up the game, no need to unlock them just balance them with the rest of your gear. Every player has a role within their squad &amp; can select the gear best suited to that role.  - Steam Workshop Game: Meaning there will be countless weapon skins, maps, modes, character models available the longer &amp; more popular the game becomes. So long as their is interest in the game new things will be added by talented creators, meaning there will always be something to keep the game fresh.  - Price: I bought my copy in the sale for £7.36, however full price it's £10.99.. very reasonable even for people who just want to give the game a go. The co-op modes alone will provide you &amp; your friends several hours worth of gametime alone making the game good value for money I feel.  Cons  - Character Models: The default character models are probably the weakest thing graphically in the game. They look dated &amp; unfinished. Also in the training mode there is an AI soldier taking you through your training &amp; his mouth doesn't move.. the character models feel dated. Although with Steam Workshop it will be improved by creators eventually.  - Graphics/map textures in general: Graphically the game feels kinda dated.. it doesn't look bad by any means, it just looks dated when you compare it to the likes of Battlefield, Arma 3 or even the latest Call of Duty games. To best some up it graphically would probably be on par with the likes of Call of Duty 4/Modern Warfare 2. Neither of which look bad by any means, they just look dated compared to some of the newer games hitting the market.  - It's a little TOO hardcore at times: I'm all for no radar, no silly juggernaut, dead silence type perks.. but something I'd like is perhaps a kill message that appears in the chat window just to let you know you've killed someone or something. I realise this probably is intentional to make you move up to confirm your kills if you've shot someone who's body has fallen behind cover. But it's something that even Arma games have &amp; it's a war simulater for goodness sake. I'd like kill messages appearing in the chat window that people can either choose to see or ignore.  - Lacks a ranking/statistic &amp; competitive system: Pretty basic, they should impliment the sort of ranking &amp; competitive system that they have in Counter-Strike in which your wins, loses, kills, deaths, accuracy &amp; objective playing statistics impact your rank as opposed to one similar to the likes of CoD/Battlefield. A ranking &amp; competitive 6v6 or 8v8 like system I feel would be good to help the community grow as people do tend to like to know how good they are &amp; what they need to improve on in order to keep the game fresh for themselves.   That's pretty much it, I've got the game &amp; already I regard it quite highly as I do like more tactical games such as Arma, however this has more of a CS/CoD style map handling for their Search &amp; Destroy like missions which is why I'm enjoying this thus far. Would highly recommend it to any fans of Arma, Counter-Strike, Battlefield or even Call of Duty if you fancy a change.",

You can modify it however you like, and there are a lot of game modes to pick from. The graphic is great, the effect and sound effect is incredible. The intense feeling of fighting building to building, street to street is surely an adrenaline and blood-pumping emotions. This game deserves a good praise, a game worth buying, and worth playing.

Anyway, I can appreciate the realism that people are talking about. Graphics are hit and miss, certain maps look better than others. I prefer the ones with more buildings as opposed to the more open-box field of view; the trees and shrubbery just dont look right and I've got my settings on high. My only complaint is when key-binding it doesn't allow me to use my scrollwheel to switch from one weapon to another. I'm guessing this adds to the realism mechanics? IE its supposed to take me longer to switch from one item to another to intensify gameplay.  Multiplayer- I can also appreciate the fact that none of the servers I've been to exhibit the neanderthal-like behavior that I've come to encounter from other games.

            "review_text": "I've now spent over 100 hours playing the Early Access of Insurgency and figured since they are very close to an official release I'd share my thoughts.  This game is very similar to Red Orchestra 2 / Rising Storm. The early access was very fun but felt slightly 'arcadey'. Not anymore. This most recent patch has been a huge step in the right direction. Tactical play and teamwork is a must and running and gunning is now even more likely to get you killed than before.  The developers seem genuinely commited to actively implementing changes based on feedback and creating the best game they can.  The controls have a good tight feeling while still applying the important real world limitations you would expect in a tactical FPS. The developers have made the wise descision to, like RO2, allow for individual adjustment of general movement and ADS (Aim Down Sight) sensitivity. The fact that in 2014 there are still FPS's lacking this feature (BF4 anyone?) is absolutely ridiculous. It is a dealbreaker for me and I refuse to play any FPS lacking it as a feature. So I was very pleased to see that like RO2 it is put to beautiful use here and once you find your balance the controls feel fantastic.  You usually only have 3 to 5 objectives but the overall mechanics are deceptively simple. There are layers of complexity and like any great game it is easy to get into but hard to master. Aiming carries with it the appropriate amount of difficulty such as sight sway, limited movement speed while prone, recoil etc. The 'If you can see it you can kill it' problem that troubles some FPS's is definitely not present here, and seemingly simple shots can be complicated by breathing and other factors.  The kit selection allows you to customize your loadout by spending a limited number of supply points on modifications (AP and HP rounds, scopes, suppressors, barrel mods etc.) These modifications actually have an effect on the performance of the weapon, and the balance on kit items is excellent. Nearly every gun can be used with the stock iron sights (hell yes!) or you can opt to attach a holo sight or 4x score if your play style is more range based. You can choose between light and heavy armor or just skip armor altogether in favor of increased movement speed. Every modification choice is a balancing act and the overall system works well in allowing players to customize their equipment to their individual play style.  The game looks good and the sound design is FANTASTIC, but none of that matters without a solid core of well engineered gameplay, and I'm happy to say Insurgency has that core.   The gameplay is skill based and unforgiving. There is an option for a killfeed but nearly no server runs it. Death comes swiftly and in many forms. You will find yourself suddenly down and have no idea where you were shot from or even who shot you. A seemingly random explosion can take out half of your team while you sit wondering what in the hell just happened. And then you realize... The guy who was peaking out from behind that wall wasn't holding a gun... It was a detonator. And that guy is probably laughing his ♥♥♥ off. The great thing about Insurgency is... Sometimes that guy is you.   I give Insurgency (in it's current state) 4 1/2 out of 5 (Stars? Bullets?) It's honestly just an excellent game overall. I have never written a review for a game before, but for some reason felt a need to for Insurgency. If you like tactical FPS's then THIS is the kind of game you should be supporting.",

Platform: Source engine, so I didn't expect much. The game is a hyper realistic take on Terrorist vs Counter Terrorists, just like CS:GO, the difference being more of a simulation feel than the arcade feel CS has had since 1.6. I've got to say, I'm unexpectedly hooked. There is no UI, no bullet counter, no automatic reloading, no overhead map, all of these things require attention to manage properly. I have to pay attention to where I am, listen for footsteps and position gunshots in the distance. Strategy is a must. The run and gun mentality isn't present, people talk to each other and watch corners. Very simulation like. A huge emersion factor is the sound, which reminds me a lot of Dayz. Supersonic bullets crackle past you, footsteps are directional and fade with distance, radios and voice chat can be heard within range. You can suppress enemies, meaning if you light up a window a sniper is hiding behind, the sniper's vision gets blurry and his heart rate increases. The weapons are interesting too, some are as old as WW2 era and are representative of what guerilla militia would have to work with. Weapon upgrades are logical: Heavier barrel, optical or red dot sights, for grips. Amours and munitions vests are a trade off to weapons upgrades. It's a game that requires thought and strategy, and actually makes me believe that each round might actually come close to what fighting in an actual battle might be like.   The most ironic thing for me is, I bought the game with money I earned selling all the items I'd won in CS:GO! Apparently the game is under development and will get better.

Teamwork is the focal point of Insurgency, and it is why this FPS will be the foundation for what future FPS games aspire to be.'  Insurgency isn't just another vanilla fps that relies on the quick go get-em pray and spray kind of multiplayer FPS that we've all become acustom to these days, but instead in its own right has brought back the realism back to a genre full of too much clutter. It's fresh. It's intense. And it's got substance. It's not a game for those looking to pop off a few rounds and kill an entire squad, but more so for the patient fps gamer who is looking for a fps game with 'teamwork' being its central mechanic.   Albeit, Insurgency may not appeal to most fps gamers because of it's minimal HUD, or lack of features, but at its core, it proves that sometimes simpler is better and that maybe that sometimes when a bullet hits you, you have to face the consequences. But who's not to say Insurgency doesn't come with its fair share of bugs? A beloved mod turned into a standalone game has a lot of work to do, but for the price point you really can't complain. An accomplishment all on its own. It offers a lot for the price being advertised, and the community involved with Insurgency offers more value that you can't get with other FPS games.  The maps blend the nostalgic feeling of many beloved FPS games and incorperates what Insurgency does best. Teamwork! In the game modes in multiplayer may feel repetitive at first, but play with the right team and every go around will play differently and keep you on th edge of your seat. One bullet to the chest and it can be game over. One slip up, and your weapon cache is destroyed. Every action has a reaction and vice versa.   Escorting the vip together, guarding an objective, and trying to out-smart the other team is what makes Insurgency a FPS game that's worth every penny.",

He's headed straight for the bomb with time running out, and you instantly riddle him with the bullets you meant to waste. He was the last one on the team. Insurgents win the round.",

            "review_text": "I am a big fan of realistic shooters. I love the graphics, the mechanics and the general way that the guns work. There are a few things that I dont like, however. One of them, is the way that this game discourages advancing forward, and heavily encourages camping. If you camp in a corner with your sights aimed at the door, you will have 2 opportunities where someone passes by and has absolutely, no chance to live, even if they anticipate that youll be at the corner. You simply have the tactical advantage, and thats the way it is. If you try to advance forward, after scanning the area for enemies, a lot of times youll find that you missed someone by a bare pixel, and youll be instantly dead the moment you are out of cover. I am new to the game, and I probably have those problems since I am new. But thats the whole problem: The game is VERY harsh on new players. I know a game should have a learning curve, but this one is the type of learning curve that could scare people away. The thing with steep learning curves, is that you can see your improvement and have at least a tiny notion that you are gonna get better. In this game, you keep dying instantly for getting out of cover for a mere second, and you just can't see the chance of getting better. Other than the way this game welcomes me as a new player, its great. I'm definitely going to keep playing it.",

Weapons: I like them all, they feel good when shooting, the recoil is realistic and their sounds are quite like in RL, but I hope they add more weapons in the future updates!   Attachments: The way scopes work is really cool and realistic, the holographic and red dot sights are really cool and effective. As for Ammo Attachments, they're balanced and you choose your ammo depending on the enemies you're facing.  Maps: I really like the maps the game has, the graphics details are really good imo.

Insurgency bares quite a resemblance to games like Counter Strike, however it is less of a twitch shooter and more of a tactical team based game where if you get shot, you will drop; you won't be turning around and shooting back...so watch your back and keep moving.  Pros: -Plethora of weapons and gear that all function accurately -Realistic FPS game, without being overly complex or slow -Multiple game modes, dedicated servers, all of the fun things you expect from a source game -Plenty of new and free content regularly.  Cons: -Biggest problem is it's high learning curve, like most tactical shooters. -A lot of downtime waiting for rounds to end and such, but not nearly as much as CS. -Quirky animations and sometiems some small graphical bugs and such.

For price to value this game tops BF4, Ghosts, BF3 and MW3 (all arguably) which were 59.99$ titles. This game is 14.99... It's way to cheap for the quality.   IN DEPTH REVIEW   It's game modes are fresh and it has a simple interface which lacks all the gadgets AAA titles give to dumb down content which is a nice step forward in challenging the easing of difficulty in FPS games to make them rely more on percision, tactical awareness, teamwork and cooperation rather than who can spin and click the fastest around corners.  This game is not for the faint of heart however... It has no mini-map and friendly fire definitely exists. Bullets really do what bullets do best. Kill. In Insurgency you're most likely to take 2 rounds before death, 3-5 over my experience either relies on being a heavily armored soldier or luck as the game has a very well balanced damage system based on where bullets hit you. You rely on teammates for supressing fire, which isn't obnoxious like BF3 but it creates a realistic atmosphere of what it may feel like to have a SAW unload on you, you rely on teammates for cover fire, support, positioning... Teamwork is key.  THERE IS NO 'UNLOCKING' OF WEAPONS... I say again that you do not unlock anything. When you purchase Insurgency it doesn't baby you along and expect the only reason you keep playing is to 'prestige' to the next level... Insurgency isn't a game for children, it's war. You get points allocated to your armor, ammo loadout, primary and secondary weapons and explosives. Everyone gets the same points... Everyone is balanced equally.   Insurgency simplifies warfare to a point where it places you as close as you'd ever possibly wish to go to an actual battlefield but it doesn't make the content easy to 'be good at' without your team. Whether you play as an Insurgent (terrorist) or Security (US) you will enjoy the differing challenges associated with your roles and abilities.  Final review? I may be biased because I've been getting tired of AAA titles being terrible (ghosts...) but... 9.5/10  Score factors in price to value ratio, weapon handling, game modes, graphic quality to price, game dynamic etc. ",

None of those annoying kids screaming insults at you. 2. Multiplayer (which is the only way to play this game) is insane. One bullet can easily kill you, so people die a lot. Somehow my bullets rarely kill anyone, though :( 3. Limited spawning in most games so games tend to be over soonish. This means I can sneak in a game pretty easiily.   People say 'no crosshair, omg so 1337', but I'm a noob, so I'd rather have the crosshair. But I get that they're trying to make it more realistic, and it doesn't detract much. I shouldn't be shooting from the hip anyway. The graphics are nothing amazing, but I don't really care much for graphics. I can see my gun, I can see the enemy, and I can see myself die. That's all I really need.  Negatives: -Not a fan of the 'ticket' based respawn system: Essentially, your team has a number of spawn tickets. When a spawn event occurs, the team loses one ticket. But it's one ticket regadless of the number of people spawned. I'd much prefer a per-person ticket system so each player spawned reduces one ticket. -No tutorial. That's a constant gripe of mine. The controls are pretty standard, so running around, crouching, going prone, shooting, etc isn't an issue. This only came up for me when I had to put on my night vision goggles and I had no idea what to do. IIRC it's not explicitly defined in the key bindings either.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

            "review_text": " No vehicles. No killstreaks. No ammo counter. No BS.   Insurgency is the tactical shooter you've always wanted.  This game regularly goes on sale (a week or so ago it was $3!) and it's a great game even for its regular $15 asking price. The combat is deep and tactical, while remaining fun. It's not ARMA level realism, and it shouldn't be-it's that right balance between realistic and fun. There are a good amount of weapons with a lot of weapon modifications such as sights, ammo loads, extended magazines, and foregrips.  The Security and Insurgent teams are imbalanced in a very balanced way-the Insurgent weapons are a bit more dated and advanced weapons are more expensive, but they also have a number of deadly explosives and hit hard. It's not asymmetrical, but the current of battle flows differently for each faction, and it's very fun chaos. Oh, and there are also AP and HP loads for all conventional firearms.  Insurgency runs smoothly and looks beautiful running a recent version of Valve's Source Engine (2011 or 2013? Not sure which.) The bots act a little goofy, but higher-difficulty bots will give you hell compared to bots from TF2 or CS:GO. While, as a Source game, the graphics options are a bit limited, it definitely looks very impressive and it runs like a dream on most modern cards.  There's also a great deal of movement control given to the player, with left/right lean options, prone, and running slides. In addition, the maps have linear objectives but many ways to go about solving them, and all maps support various gameplay modes, both co-operative and PvP, on both day and night settings.  Did I mention co-operative? Yes, this game is also a co-op shooter. You can have a team of 8 people in various co-op gamemodes against bots, from frantic Insurgents surviving an onslaught of Security forces to standard checkpoint games to defend-the-cache survival and so on. And, yes, this game does have night maps-all day maps also have a night version, and they all support all gamemodes. The night combat is just as thrilling as the daytime firefights.  Oh, and it's also a World War II shooter. The officially-supported Day of Infamy mod that places the American and German armies in a conflict on the Western Front is somewhat integrated into the main game, with DoI servers showing up on the server browser in both PvP and co-op, and super easy installation of DoI-just go sub to a workshop collection.  EDIT: Day of Infamy is now its own Early Access title.  This goes hand-in-hand with the way New World Interactive, the developers, treat their community-they are very connected with the players, often have livestreams and Q&amp;As, and are just genuinely nice people.   If all these things don't convince you, I don't think anything will. Buy this game! You'll have a blast. ",

And now what pi**es me off the most: The game automatically kicks you from any server when your ping is higher than 150. My ping is normally at 200 or 180, well playable. So if you have bad internet, do not buy the game. I tried joining some servers today but I got kicked from every single one. Singleplayer doesn't really work either, there are only certain maps you can use bots on and on those you have to spawn them in using the console which is really annoying.  Not being allowed to play is a MASSIVE contra for me (Duh), so I will give this game, which I love for it's gameplay, only 4/10 points.  *EDIT* So, as you can see, a dev answered this review. The ping kick is not on all servers. I didn't know that, so I guess if I spend a little time with it I'll find a server without. This makes my contra argument invalid and the community service is just amazing.  How about 11/10?",

Nonetheless this multiplayer-only game is pretty fun.   The game also has a fair amount of game modes, going from playing with friends vs AI to skirmish which combines 2 game modes in one. Also If you rush in FPS, this game might not be for you. I consider myself a rusher and that lead me to have 8:15 or worse KD in my first matches, if you rush or peak around corners in the middle of the battlefield expect to watch how your teammates play the whole match. Speaking of teammates the community is friendly, active and it is getting bigger. The only thing I dislike about the people playing the game is that everybody is jumping in and out of the server in the middle of a match, there should be a penalty or some kind of auto balance.   So take your time, move in packs, be patient and learn how your team and enemy uniforms look like, I have killed a lot of my mates and spare the lives of some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s having a lucky time due to not knowing if it was on my team or not.  All and all this is a great game, I recommend it if you are looking for a fresh FPS experience and for the price, I think this game worths every penny. I hope the developers keep adding weapons and most importantly maps... cause if I use the 'Find a match' option I almost always end playing on the same 2 maps.",

First of all, when you start the game you will notice the amazing design of overlay and HUD, they nail it on the head with simplicity and excellence. On top of that, this game looks great with the max settings on, I won't lie. But the main core element of this game is the realism, both in gameplay and sounds. Every explosion and gunshot sounds realistic and can change depending on where are in relative position to it. The aiming is executed greatly, with a system where you can hold your breath to increase accuracy, and mount your gun on a tripod when crouching to shoot from lower angles. Every death seems well deserved, and executed in a usually one shot one kill style that is realistic to actual warfare. No one in this game is a bullet sponge by any stretch of the imagination. Even one stray bullet could kill you. The maps in this game are also amazing. They are brilliantly designed and dynamic, with stealth and tactics in mind. They also include day and night cycles for all of them, creating a whole new feel for the maps and new options for the way you fight. Overall, spending a few bucks on this game is well worth it.

I felt that at the time when it was in peak popularity (keep in mind, it was a free source mod) that it was very different than most modern shooters. It was extremely fast-paced and you could just fall on your face and be dead instantly because someone sniped you from a hilltop half a mile away, but that's just the way it really is. This game is currently in Beta and I highly recommend you pick it up now before it rises in price again. I've played the game since the Alpha and there have been some major changes in it. They have completely refaced some of the maps to add more color and so much more, as well as adding new guns and even implemented a class system similar to the first game. When the game first came out into alpha, it was relatively a generic shooter but as it progresses it is picking up more and more of what made the first game unique. There are many attachments for guns, including the type of bullets themselves, that can be purchased in-match with Supply points that you earn by getting kills and completely objectives. Different classes specialize in different weapon types and sets, with some classes having you spawn with decked-out weapons that you would otherwise have to pay supply points for all of the attachments. To clarify, Supply points are not a real-money currency, but are only present during a single match. They are received and spent in-match and do not travel over to other matches. This game has come a long way from the Alpha and I am very sure that this company will continue to expand on their new take on this game, as well as continue to modernize and consequently re-implement maps from the first game, some of the most interestingly layed-out maps I have ever played in a multiplayer-based shooter. Pick this game up while it's still cheap, as I'm sure the price will go up once the game continues on its way out of beta.",

Sitting behind a truck as you struggle for cover while bullets bounce off every surface is something that this game does very right. When bullets hit the clinking noise as well as the effect are terrifying and immersive, as well as the echoed gunshots.  Gunplay is another thing this game has gotten very, very right. The way hip-firing doesn't just shoot straight ahead but you can adjust it to fire slightly to the edges of your screen, recoil and screen shaking, and the sheer volume of the weapons compared to other things make gunplay extremely satisfying and challenging. Landing a hip shot as you burst into a room of a guy standing in a dark corner of the room, destroying the counter that was right behind him and watching all the bottles and pots that were on it go flying is the coolest thing.  And the sheer size and scale of the maps, but the way they are focused make for dynamic, tense and altered gameplay without it getting boring or leaving you saying 'I just want something to happen' is a feet within itself.  This is one of the best multiplayer FPS games I've gotten my hands on in a while, and for 15$ that kind of quality is nothing to pass up. I'd recommend this game if it was a 30$ title.",

Cons: -Some modes and maps are unbalanced. -The game can get tedious. -Depends on teamwork a lot. -Looks outdated in some areas.   Insurgency is a hardcore FPS that revolves around methodical gameplay and strategy. I expected the game to be harder to access and get used to, but I was hooked and did well in just few matches; the reason behind that is no stupid controls and low tickrate.   Controls were nice; they were fast and responsive, and didn't control like some 100ms lag tanky Battlefield ♥♥♥♥. The damage is high, and weapons have a strong recoil and weapon kick. Hip-firing actually works (due to high damage), but you will most likely be going from cover to cover and carefully observing and clearing each area. Team work and map knowledge is required too.  The maps (get used to suburban, middle-east/iraq-like maps) are nice, and the modes are fun and unique. There are some issues in the maps where some teams are more favored and have access to better routes, but they are not glaringly broken.    I would recommend the game to anyone who is looking for a change from the generic online shooters and how absurd they can get. Be warned though, as Insurgency is supposed to be a slower-pace, lame game--a combination of chess with shooting/dexterity requirements.",

I got this while I had a timeout on CS:GO, me being quite an avid CS player along the years. It's definitely hardcore, you can die in one hit and most of the times you WILL. At the time of writing this review the game is really not that well optimised, not running that well on a GTX 560 when more graphic-intensive games run better.. You can also say it's more or less a work in progress. The game is fairly complete, but many updates are being released regularly, and you can see that the vision of the devs is quite a few updates away.  There is a 'coop' mode and 'versus' mode. The 'versus' mode being Team Deathmatch and objective-based maps, and the 'coop' being you playing against AI enemies on the same objective-based maps from 'versus' mode. I can say I had the most fun on the 'coop' mode. Like any online team game, you need to get matched with fairly decent players to have fun, and many people are still noobs at this game, running and gunning instead of being tactical, but fortunately the game offers you options to educate them, via team chat or microphone. So 'coop' mode is very fun, but if you're not satisfied you can try the more competitive 'versus' mode.",

A few things that I disliked about this game was the auto healing. I'd prefer a medic kit type of healing if any healing at all, and the medic kit wouldn't be a spammable option and you'd have to wait out the effects.  The 'Competetive' 5v5 game mode is a heavy joke for a person like me used to the competetive scene of CSGO, which in it's own right is a joke. You can drop in and out as you please, and it's not very fun. There's no competetive ranking in the game, only the normal mod ones.  Now this isn't to say I don't enjoy this game, albiet not playing it very often. If the competetive mode had a ranking system and a no-drop-out style I'd log hours upon hours on this game.

There are a number of reasons why this is.  1. Controls - More cmplex than your aaverage fps but not like ARMA. Nice control over a fairly agile character that makes it a lot of fun.  2. Atmosphere - The game has awesome moments on most modes and maps that really are great advertisements of the game such as when you are trying to capture the last point on push and both the attackers and defenders have not reinforcements left.  3. Difficulty - The game has a punishing amount of room for error as many guns need only one headshot to take you down armor or not. Weapons like the AK are almost unstoppable if you leave yourself weak on one side.  4. Performance - This game performs perfectly since the recent update on MY LAPTOP. To me that is ludicrous as many games perform poorly with way lower requirements.  5. They're still updating - The last update was awesome and brought a new map, loads of new weapons including a revolver :D and also have reinvigorated the community.  6. Range of weapons - There are a lot of weaons in this game that suit a different playstyle. On one match of push the attacking side my use the M16A4, a burst fire/semi-auto rifle while the defenders may use an ak. Also for each class there are a number of weapons that can be used differently.",

Gradually add in the milk and water, stirring to combine. Add the salt and butter; beat until smooth. Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crepe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.

Any of the gamemode proposed are objective-oriented and there is no room for CoD's tankers. The particle and sound effects are well done, even better than some AAA games out there. You can't judge the graphics since this is using the Source engine but they are promizing. The fact they support the Workshop and don't have planned a list of DLC is a cool move.   However, they have a lot of work in optimizing the game for pople having a low end computer, it's still playable but you will encounter some lags in-game and it can even make Steam freeze sometime. And I've noticed some minor random bugs in the physics side of things.   If you've played Arma 3, battlefield, Counter Strike and/or Call of duty MW3's hardmode then this game should be familiar to you. But be aware, it is nothing compared to the previously quoted titles, the gameplay is much more frustrating and you MUST be vigilant. Skill matter here.  Finally, I do recommend this game but you'll need a clean computer or a decent rig to make work at the moment.   Final verdict of 9/10 as it is for now and I'm sure it will continue evolving in the right side of the gaming industry.  ",

The sound design is very good, you get all the bullet snaps and cracking and your charcaters even yell when they're getting shot at or performing actions.

Recoil and power behind guns is there , so then you shoot it feels like you are shooting bullets not pixels.  Game modes are plenty and all of them pretty well executed. Some less tactical than others but non of them just mindless running and gunning.  Good amount of maps , guns , attachments , modes.   No pesky unlockables , skins for guns and all that nonsense which makes some other big FPS's feel like barby dress up games insted of shooters.

You have to check your surrondings and make sure all the enemies are cleared out before capturing something. Note: there is also friendly fire. When you get shot, your screen will blur up a bit. Also it only takes about 3-5 bullets to kill you. The reason I love this game so much is that It is so realistic, it makes it harder to play but more fun altogether. I see a lot of people say this game is a lot like CS:GO because of the graphics. The graphics may not be the best out there, but they beat CS:GO.

Wait to see a guy or maybe two and get a kill. Or get instant killed. Then, wait 15 seconds to respawn. Rinse and Repeat.  Theres no flow to the game what so ever. I can see why people like this game but coming from a Battlefield background, there are no similiarites. I could never see myself putting 1000+ hours into this game like I have for every single battlefield.   ",

I don't know if Game Publishers buy Fake Reviews, but everybody in here says 'Oh this game is amazing, is great bla bla bla'. But you know what? NO ! This GAME Has a Great Potential but now by now it sucks. Unless if you play in the Multiplayer of Course. But here we go with the problems during the Singleplayer Experience:  -Friendly AI sucks... They're really useless during firefight, they die almost instantly leaving you all alone to fight like 20 jihadi's. And the game pretend you to win.  -Another dumb thing, the game gives you just +3 Men plus you = 4 soldiers in total to fight a whole army of enemies. That's dumb, unrealistic and almost an impossible game experience.  -9 times out of 10, there's an annoying glitch with the Friendly AI that makes them like spinning around you like magnets. The thing itself is not annoying just because they spin around you for no actual reason, but because they begin to stalker you until they can spin around you and make your character move (without pressing any button) on the right and left. Basically due their body contact with your 'virtual body' you get pushed with them.  -Another problem with the SOLO Gameplay Experience, is that is not realistic at all. You really don't fight the enemies like in a real war. They simply spawn here and there, after getting triggered by some 'Checkpoint' on the map. It's freakin' dumb and i don't really find the terms to explain how stupid this way to make a game really is. This game pretends to be realistic, but no, it isn't and i'm worried if Insurgency ever will be.  Basically in few words, what this game pretends to be is a Low-Res version of Battlefield 3, nothing less and nothing more of that. The FPS is not that great, there's not a great choice of weapons and the 'TEAM COMMAND ORDERS' really doesn't do anything at all, it's very useless.  So NO, don't buy this game until the ♥♥♥♥♥♥s who created this will fix all of these problems. And the Source Engine it's truly terrible. It looks like to be playing a L4D2 kind of Military adaption to it. If you mod L4D2 with an M4A3, then you basically already bought this game. ",

Here we have a floating camera type of game with one-shot kills and 'realistic weapons'. Footsteps are close to impossible to hear, even if a player is running on a concrete floor next to you. Accordingly, the gameplay quickly becomes the blind chicken-gameplay Battlefield and COD are so famous for, albeit with much more camping. And just what is with one-shot kills that is supposed to be 'realistic'? Would you automatically fall unconscious/die after being hit by 5.56 round? Really? Is this how reality works? You could say I'm being nitpicky about some of this games rather unsufferable shortcomings but I'm not this game is ♥♥♥♥ in a lot of areas and to any preferred tactical shooter this is never a good thing.  Insurgency provides a fair amount of weapons and attachments for these weapons - clearly inspired by Battlefield - and the weapons admittedly have a great feel to them. But the contrast between the 'realistic weapons' and the rubberbanding players running around at a speed that is anything but realistic, leaves me unimpressed.

Map design alone is horrendous with one map having you run out of a tunnel into the enemies direct line of fire from their spawn at the very start. Horrible. I've describeed this game as 'The developers took the worst parts from CS:GO and ARMA and combined them into a game.' Im sure you'll see reviews about how 'tactical, and team based it is.' That's an out right lie. You still have everyone running all over the map lone wolfing it, even when there is only one objective to defend people still just do how they please without supporting the team. Gun play is 'meh' at best. Sure you kill people with an average of two bullets but its so lack luster and shooting is so clunky it's hard to feel any sense of enjoyment. More time than not you'll get shot when in cover, or you'll try to shoot through something that is 1 way bulletproof, usually the other guys side, sorry. Kills don't feel rewarding and deaths don't feel justified. And that is a combination that ruins a players experience. Now I know the screenshots make it look squad based and team focused but you'll encounter hackers, the grenade spamming is off the charts, lone wolfers, etc. Also the head glitching is probably the worst I've ever seen in a game. Eyes are not necessary it appears as the top of a helmet or turban suffices for an enemy to mow you down. And the top of headwear dont register as places you can shoot so you are severely at a disadvantage. I havn't had a single moment of fun or enjoyment from insurgency aside from maybe the funny tutorial dialouge. I would say avoid it and try to find something else. If you want team based shooting try to get into the upper tiers of CS:GO competitive, if you want open maps and MILSIM style engagements pick up ARMA 3.

I can tell you right now, the anti-cheat is no bueno!  Secondly, no matter how much 'safety' you have in your spawn, it does not stop you from being spawn killed by other players. Yep, spawn and insta-gibbed. Wait another minute to respawn. Another broken system in this game.  Third, goes back with your spawn protection. The maps are pretty much gauntlets with not much room to move around. You are pretty much forced to fight head-on every game. If you DO happen to flank an enemy, you will be met with a 'Restricted Area' notice, where you cannot do anything but turn around and take one in the back. Yep, this game doesn't reward tactics, only latency.  Is this a good FPS? Well, it could be worse. Do I have fun playing it? I use to, when you could tell everyone was on an equal playing field.

CO-OP is mainly on teamwork if you go alone the AI will bum rush you like Jam stuck on your fingers! It is pretty nice with The choice of the gear you want the weight limits are good. Now the cons on this game.. The CO-OP is really hard and i mean it deep down in my heart. It is like the Enemy AI has AIMBOT. There is also friendly fire.. The guns have too much recoil and reloading takes a little bit of time and if your playing multiplayer you have to stress about the friendly fire but IN the end IT is nice to see That this game used to be a mod But it is now an offical game Congrats to the DEVS. I recommend it if you like CO-OP or a nice casual Fire fight on multiplayer Deathmatch 15 Dollars is a fair price If you are lucky enough And caught a Sale or two I would snag it   Therefore 7/10 ",

I cant believe this game is even listed under 'simulation' and im ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off i wasted my money on it honestly.   Everyone talks about how tactical it is...HOW is this considered tactical? Its literally like an indie version of call of duty.   I beg anyone of the fanboys defending this title and praising it as anything more than that, to go play red orchestra 2 or arma 2/3. all 3 of those titles blow this piece of junk out of the water as far as realism and tactics.   the graphics, gun sounds, maps are all quite literally a joke...go play call of duty on hardcore mode and you have this game with better graphics, maps, sounds, etc.   Im seriously PO'd at the misleading reviews hyping this game up as anything more than it is and making people waste their time and money.   I didnt even make it a week with this game before saying 'f&amp;*k it' and downloading Arma 3 for $60, which is what i should've done in the first place.   if you want realism and tactics with great ballistics, gameplay and graphics go get RO2 or Arma 2 (almost the same price) or Arma 3 which is probably the best milsim ive ever played.",

            "review_text": "I should start off by saying that this game isn't a bad game; I like the concept, and I like that they're going for a realistic feel. There's no hit indicator, no ammunition count (especially concerning how many rounds are still in your clip/magazine), and a very minimalistic HUD that doesn't allow you to spot your enemies or see your squad's movements through walls. All of these things create a much more realistic experience than you would get if you were playing something like COD. I like the concept, as I said earlier, but I feel as though the verisimilitude is lost on gamers due to technological limitations. In real life, you'd be able to hear where the enemy (and your squad) is better than you would in a game; you'd have better communication than you would in a game; you'd be able to better understand your injuries and your capabilities than you would in a game (there's no health idicator in Insurgency, so you don't know how much health you have). While this game does provide a fun experience for people who want a more realistic alternative to games like COD, I would still say that it falls short of what it is aiming for. I would say that this game would be totally worth it if it supported Occulus Rift in 4k resolution, if you also had high-quality headphones on that supported surround sound, and if you had a mic. Then you would have a more realistic experience and be more capable of reading and interpreting your environment. As it stands, the games minimalistic approach is not suitable for people who have a single monitor and mono (or even stereo sound). Without the features that make up for the fact that you're playing a computer game (i.e. hit indicators, health, spotting, etc.) the game isn't able to give you a solid understanding of your environment.  I also think that the game - being a source engine game - is quite similar enough to the Counter Strike games that you could purchase the Counter Strike games and get a more computer gaming friendly experience. As it stands, Insurgency feels like a graphically suped up Counter Strike game with a minimalistic HUD. If that is an experience you're looking for, then give Insurgency a shot; if not, then you could just purchase or stick to Counter Strike and you won't be upset for having done so.",

They are dumb but can 1 shot you from a kilometer away.  Multiplayer : Camp, Camp and more camp. Almost no one goes for the objective.  Graphics : Uhm.. it looks like a 2003-2005 game. And it still cant hold 60fps.Even though my rig far exceeds the recommended settings.  Community : Awfull.  Gameplay : I mean.. it adds something cool when u cant see if you hit or killed an enemy.. but it can also be verrrrry annoying. Also 9/10 times when u get killed, you have no idea where that lethal shot came from, but you know it will be from a cornercamper. Hitboxes are REALLY weird in this game. You might think you nailed that headshot only to find out it wasn't a hit and then u get 1 hitted by a spraying enemy.  Be prepared for a lot of waiting while ur dead. Sometimes this can take up to 1 minute, which is a part of the game i understand but it doesnt help it one bit.  I mean i guess it could be fun if you have a full team with people who know what they are doing, but pub is just a mess with campers in every corner.  I cannot reccomend this game to anyone to be honest. It was far better years ago when it was still a free mod. It rocked back then. But now.. there are waaaay better 'tactical' fps games. I use the word tactical lightly as it only stands for camping in this game. Its like Rainbow Six Siege... but with more corners to camp in.  So to sum it up :  Co-op - NO Multiplayer - NO Solo - Haven't tried so i can't say anything bout that Graphics - NO Community - NO Gameplay - NO ( It could work but it needs a lot of tweaks and fixes )  All in all 3/10 imo  REMEMBER : This is all my opinion.",

Sensitivity is different for all 3 aim modes, (Hip, Iron, and Scope) and never feels right between the 3. Video settings take at least 1-2 minutes to take effect, and you're stuck with annoying looping audio as the menu loads. Playerbase is dwindling, with only about 2k players on worldwide at any given point. Competitive play is all but dead. Map pool has not been updated, and the game modes are stale and repetitive.  Due to the above 2 reasons, the game lacks visceral intensity, and makes for matches that border on completely casual. Graphics are not at all impressive, and rather aged looking, surprising considering how intensive the game is on rigs.   ",

I can pump about 4-5 rounds into an enemy and he might get a bit wounded, but he won't die (bearing in mind I ALWAYS use AP rounds, rifles and pistols). That same enemy could easily turn around and kill me with 1-2 rounds. *Some* people could be cheating, it's a possibility, but more often than not, it's just the game being a prick (Yes, that's right. The game itself is a prick)!  Also, I am a casual gamer. The only thing I'm truly hardcore about is simulators, racing sims to be precise, so I'm not very good at this type of game.   Which is a problem.   Most people who play this aren't too dissimilar from COD players in the sense that they play it so religiously that it's borderline unfair on newbies like myself, which is why I personally think the game would benefit from a system like Blacklight Retribution where certain levels mean access to certain servers, so noobs can fight noobs and pro's can fight pro's. A noob vs a pro just isn't fair, I can't get into the game and I only ragequit whilst contemplating why I even bought this in the first place... Doesn't exactly inspire me to keep trying!  One final thing - a LOT of people **will** scream 'ALLAH ACKBAR!!!!' when they're on the Insurgents team. One simply **must** learn to love this, or else one will find it funny for a little while, then one will begin to get annoyed very quickly after. Hell, they may even do it on the Security force team. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!  If you have CS, don't bother with this, you won't even need this. It's not as good. I can't speak for CS:GO, never played, but even CS Source is more fun than this.   If you're a casual gamer, don't bother. You won't have fun with this.   If you don't like hearing the same jokes over and over again, don't bother.   Don't even care if this review gets bad ratings, I think these are valid points. You're better than this! You don't need this, run whilst you still can.  On the upside, oh, wait.... Nope.

The fighting that occurs and the gunfights are very redundant, as all weapons seem to have the same damage count, but with different accuracy and limitations. The game is physically so realistic, that it takes no skill in any sort of firefight, other than knowing the map locations. It barely takes any shots from your gun, to kill the enemy. There is little reaction that can be done once you are fired upon. The learning curb is so small, it makes PVP frustrating since it's more of a camp and wait sort of game type. COOP with your friends, allow you to take on the AI, and even they possess less of a challenge, as you can easily kill them.    I've read that it's hardcore… not really. Again, a very small learning curb. You'll kill just as many people, in PVP, as you'll die. The game's vanilla maps, all set in the same general geographic location (save for some), tire a player out, and custom maps allow some extensibility.    Yes, you can assort your weapons and your equipment, which makes the game appeasing, but how many other games do that with better benefits? That does partially give you an advantage in any fair fight, but the guns have almost the same capabilities, when placed with each other. You can hardly notice the difference between an AKM and an AK-47, other than the design of the gun on your screen. Changing your bullet type won't even hinder a difference. Now there are some weapons out there that are so very poorly done (Shotguns), but other than them, the Rifles all tend to mimic themselves.   The game can be considered a very hardcore realistic shooter, but it's bland. It's the same ordeal every time.",

But constant server lag, often so bad that others on the server will point it out over voice chat, is an even more potent recipe for disaster.

This game was pretty fun for the first 5 hours of playing it, as I enjoy realistic FPS's thoroughly and thought it would be a cool to play one set in modern times.  However, this game I HIGHLY do not reccommend.  It's literal design is to make you think 'Wow, $15 is pretty cheap. Im gonna buy it.' and then you play it for 20 hours or so before you stop playing it permanantely. Is it really worth spending $15 to have 15 hours of fun? Maybe. Depends on your financial situation.  This game is fantastic for squads of friends to play against each other, but usually ends up like this;  Round starts, everybody throws cheap to buy frags across the map and kills over half of each others teams without skill. Continous ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t ensues, with the players who dont have 200+ hours getting ridicoulously mad at each other and at the other team. One team wins constantly, usually 6 and 0. You rarely will find balanced teams. When teams ARE scrambled, things somehow always find their way back to where they started.  My biggest problem was overall gameplay. Your gun doesn't shoot for some reason, the game saves your previous weapon fire-selection so when you get into close-quarters you shoot one round instead of fully-auto, tons of people have a glitch where they aim straight up and cant fix it until they restart the game (and it comes back), and also how terrorists get amazing equipment, did I mention random calls?  'RELOADING COVER ME' when you're the last guy alive doesn't help you very much.  Look, I know that the game is trying to be fair, but when a terrorist using surplus 1952 grenades from the USSR is BETTER than a united states frag, something isn't right. It seems that terrorists have little to no recoil while the US ♥♥♥♥ing flies everywhere, and in it goes against everything a Kalashnikov stands for.  Once more, if you've read all of this, I congratulate you. You're one of the few to do so.  I may just suck at it to an extremely unrealistic amount, but I've played tons of FPS's (Red Orchestra/Rising Storm, Battlefield(s), CODs, those are what I mostly did/do) and I'm good at them, but this was just ♥♥♥♥ing abysmal.

Truth be told, my computer is not exactly a rocket, but the graphics is not that damn beautiful for me to be forced to put every setting on low and still get lags while I'm able to run nicer and newer games almost maxed out. It crashes everytime I alt+tab too. Take this review as a warning that if you wanna play Insurgency, you're gonna have to sacrifice a few hours on fixing problems. Devs will recommend workarounds instead of really fixing them.  Secondly, I played a few rounds and all I saw were the same modes and same gameplay that millions of other first person military shooters offer. So this is nothing extraordinary OR I didn't feel it in it. Although I liked the option to apply different parts to your weapons, like scopes and various bullets, according to what you prefer.  I got this game by accident because my friend had a few spare copies for which I'm grateful, but I don't see myself playing this after the  terrible performance issues that are not on my side . I am not a military lover and still I'm trying to judge this game objectively but understand that I simply cannot recommend a game this badly optimized.

            "review_text": "Update: This review got more attention than any of my reviews so I decided update it  One thing I wanted to add was that I now have logged almost 40 hours in the game because I have had a few realizations. Here they are:  1. There is nothing else like this. What I mean by this is there is no other multiplayer shooter that takes place in the middle-east between Security Forces and Insurgents. Not counting the shooters that are in the middle-east but involve the whole Russian influence thing. This is a pure Iraqi War themed shooter.  There is games like Arma, but it's really intense simulation style of play [not sure about 3], Call of Duty, and I could name more. But for $14.99 it is a really good deal for those wanting a military shooter. And to reiterate....no other shooter with this theme...that has a relatively big size community. If there is, show me.  2. You eventually forget about some of the cons. All the rage enduced fits paid off. All those times of dying cause I get stuck on terrain no longer make me so angry. The obvious hit detection mistakes are only noticible if you are intently watching. The night maps are not a bother cause you know what to look for in the dark even with the blinding light bulbs that you can't shoot out. Why? Because I am so used to them it doesnt bother me. It's a list of mistakes that you eventually learn how to work around.  3. I still can not recommend this game. Why? It is most deff. not for everyone. And a lot of my friends I have convinced to try this game usually complain about the same things I did and quit before getting used to them. NO ONE wants to learn around the mistakes WHILE learning how the game works. Take Arma for example. I got it recently for the DayZ mod. I learned how to play the game in the campaign, went to DayZ, killed some people, played a little bit of ACE [it's a mod] and kill some more and guess what? I didn't get killed because of flawed game mechanics. Insurgency is good but at the end of the day it asks you....'Do you recommend this game?' not 'Do you like this game?'   Original:  I really really really REALLY REALLY wish there was a inbetween option called maybe or mixed.  Insurgency is one of those games I'll probably have over 20 hours in [15.3 as of this review] and I'll get those people who say 'Oh you gave it a negative review but you still put time into it?' So I am going to explain why I like and dislike this game and why I decided to give it a thumbs down.   for the people who don't want to have to read a long and drawn out review--here is the pros and cons list with a section I include called 'Both' where it depends on who you are if it is a pro or con.  Pro: Intense gameplay due to the lack of informational hud [ammo in the clip, mini-map, etc.] Realistic Gun Mechanics Realistic damage [you die in a few shots] Achievements  Both: Teamwork is required to win Score is more than important than kills [You can go killess and be high up on the leaderboard] Night Maps that require night vision goggles or flashlights Suppression Maps from the mod Different classes that have unique weapons from the other classes No Medics No Bulletdrop Friendly Fire No vehicles No Killstreak rewards  Cons: Often get stuck on small objects or terrain Hit detection seems [to me] to be off sometimes Invisible walls around terrain keep you from shooting [you aim over a rock but still hit it] Maps are really straight foward and small Spawn killing is rampant People [I'll explain later]  Now that we got that out of the way time for the explaination of some of those things  The maps are so small. Some are Call of Duty big and some barely meet the size of the smallest Battlefield maps. If you ever played Mag on PS3 then you got the idea of the map size. Some maps seem to be huge but there is restricted areas for both factions. You can only go so far behind the map of the other team. Which is good I guess, but it still doesn't eliminate spawn killing....but I'll get to that after this rant. I am not one of those guys that want earth sized maps. I personally think GTA 5's map is a little too big. The reason I wish the maps were bigger is due to the realistic gun play. Hip firing is pretty much no scoping with a sniper rifle. Even if you have a lazer light or a fore grip the gun will go uncontrollable if you hip fire. Not saying that is bad, but on a map where close quarters is 85% of the time the realism of gun mechanics just make the game feel....clunky. Iagine if call of duty or battlefield had realistic kick and climb. Battlefield wouldn't have been too bad, but if it happened to Call of Duty it would just end up in people getting lucky.   I'll use Rising Storm as an example. The maps aren't exactly the largest maps in the world, but their open terrain and lack of buildings creates less of close quarters and more of shoot outs. There could be a squad of guys in a pillbox firing at your little nest in the trees. It's an intense game of 'who is more accurate' instead of 'who was able to control the kick in a corridor.   Maybe I am the only one who has beef with the gun mechanics mixed with the small maps, but It bothers me. Love the gun mechanics, hate the map size.  Wonder why I said people? Why is that a con? One thing I will defend Call of Duty on is that one guy can win it for the team. In Insurgency you could win it alone but it is highly unlikely. While I love teamwork games, I play this mainly by myself so I can talk to someone in skype and create atleast a 2 man team. It comes to me putting faith in trust in my team which usually bites me right on the bottom. Any game that requires teamwork is going to be fustrating and annoying. Quite frankly, the majority of Insurgency players never go pile up on the objective when there is only 20 seconds left and no waves. It seems like either no one knows how the game works, or they want a positive K/D ratio.  Rising Storm had the same problem only a million times worse....just proof teamwork is annoying unless you have friends  Speaking of Kills......spawn killing....holy crap is spawn killing a son of a beach. Restricted areas would make you think you can't spawn kill but oh boy they don't. On the map Sinjar....oh Lord Sinjar....there is a spawn for Insurgents where if you run straight out of spawn [the direction you are facing] you can get sniped. Spawn sniped, spawn sniped. Eventually I learned to go left or right. I shouldn't have to take a detour, but that spawn makes you since it is so dumb. Every map with the exception of maybe one or two have this problem.   If don't understand what I mean by the invisble wall on objects and terrain I'll paint you a picture. On the map Peak I was on the Insurgent team using the SKS with a Kobra sight, fore grip, and AP rounds. I run to a rock, peak around the corner, aim down the sights and shoot at a Security Force squad charging towards me. I fire and all that happens is dust gets kicked up. I was shooting the rock appartently, and the Security dudes shot me to death. It happens to me all the time. It drives me insane.  For me, Night Maps suck. You can't shoot out light bulbs so when you are using NVGs sometimes you'll be blinded. But if you take'em off you can't see nothing past that light bulb. So Now I use NVGs and flashlights to ensure I can see at all times. It's a minor inconvience but it gets me killed.   A lot of my complaints are minor and don't happen all the time. Getting stuck on small objects and terrain doesn't happen too often but when it does it's annoying. This is why I give Insurgency a negative review. I didn't have to get used to the controls or gameplay or anything like that. I had to get used to the clunky mechanics and the minor problems. I like the game, but as far as recommending it I have to say it depends on your patience.   Since there is more things wrong with this game that right....I have to give it a thumbs down",

The push and tug of war maps is what made the original insurgency mod so great. Something the developers have completely missed.  Graphics have some how become worst with each patch, player models now look like they have been taken from TF2, infact everything has a more stylised/cartoon look to it. Each map has a different coloured haze, a layer of fog just put infront of you.   Sounds and animations are average at best.  UI design is confusing, squad/team/weapon loadout screens are confusing and not necessary. What happened to just pick class, pick your weapon and spawn. Weapon customisations?? do we really need this....  Game pace is way too fast, yes the mod was fast also, but it was tatical. Game pace now directly compares with COD and CS. You can go from full sprinting to firing to changing stance very quickly.

CQC maps play fast and action-heavy, strongly reminding me of AA or CS, whilst long-range maps play like RO or Arma (whoever spots first lives longer). All already done. 'Squad'-system is barely better then giving you differently colored teamnames.  So, what do we have, overall? Just another basic FPS which for sure isn't 'bad or anything', but has, in my oppinion, no real interesting concept or strong point either. The only thing innovative, at all, are the gamemodes (one life per player, 3 objectives, every time an objective is taken the team of the aggressor is respawned).  But that really doesn't save the game at this point. If I want to play a generic FPS, I got loads of them already, no need to buy another one. This game is, indeed, in early developement phase, which means it COULD still get more fleshing out later on. But right now, I really don't see much of a point playing, even less so buying it.",

            "review_text": "The game features smooth FPS/Military sim controls, that are in the same vain of Call of Duty. This allows for an easier learning curve than something say ARMA where the controls themselves take a fair amount of time to learn and master. So if you have played an FPS before you should be able to run around and shoot. There is not much of a HUD though in the game, you will have to count your rounds as a result (which I personally am all for, though the use of tracer rounds helps you realise when a magazine is near empty). There is also no crosshairs as a result of the diminished HUD, bullets will generally fly in the same direction of the gun but do be wary that this is not preferred as recoil, and movement will greatly decrease this accuracy and you will most likely be killed.  The shooting is very responsive and the guns do have (in my opinion) a good weight. I haven't felt like I've been wielding a pea shooter, this also means that AI and players are easy to kill, as well as yourself. Thus learn to conceal yourself and use cover appropiately.  The AI has shown to be very smart, flanking and out maneuvering as it advances players, they will also hunt you, moving to flashlights of players and recent gunfire locations. They will prove a challenge, especially at high difficulty, in which there are 3 difficulties for AI's. Do be aware of checking the difficulty servers are playing on if you are new to the game and are still learning how to play. Though sometimes the AI makes some, very lucky shots, lets say but from how I've viewed them shooting in AI matches it appears they fire generally from the hip, so it is more of a random factor then an instant targetting mechanic they have. (This may change)  Communication can be done with preset lines like what you would see in Tribes, normal messaging like in most multiplayer games and also voice chat. So far using any of these with the team will serve appropiate, probably reset your voice chat key to something that is easier to reach.  All guns are available from purchase of the game, there will be differing choices available depending on what class you choose in which there are to many to name but each serve a function and will have relevent weaponary, including equipment, armour and accessories. There is a point system like in the recent Call of Duties so you can't pick everything unless the server is constructed that way (most are not).  There are a few game modes, though each match doesn't feel like the same as the AI will move differently on general each match, so don't expect to always be working the same way each match, be prepared to adapt.  Steam workshop is also available, you can get skins for the guns, different sounds on top of many other possible features you can change or add. None of the workshop content requires money so far as I know, I've myself picked up some skins for rifles that people have released.  The game does not have veichles so if you are looking for large scale warfare you would be better looking at ARMA, but if you are looking for a strong infantry skirmish with great gun mechanics, AI, maps and a step away from the norm of lone wolf multiplayer shooters, I would say this game is most likely for you.",

You don't need a powerful computer to run this, so you don't have to buy the top market PC for this type of game. :) Though I was banned, I can say that the combat is very immersive and sometimes games get your adreneline rushing. In light of the situation, I'll still continue to hope for maybe an unban and some big updates. I assure the creators, moderators, and admins that I no longer cheat, especially on competetive games such as this one here. Anyways, I sincerely recommend this game. I am a person who is very pedant and cares greatly about games such as this. By no means should this review detour you from buying this game. I strongly believe in this game's future.

I have just started to play this game and its already been a great purchase even at its $17 price tag. I play on a mac and it was good for a bit and then crashed while changing maps. I tried to reopen it but it crashed on startup. Long story short, you need to go to the context menu on Insurgency (right click it in your library), click properties, go to the tab called 'general' and uncheck the box that says 'Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game'. You will not be able to shift-tab in the game but at least you can play it. I have two monitors so I play on my main monitor and have the chat and friends list on the other.  Pros: -Very realistic -no minimap -minimal HUD -no killfeed (you can have it on if you want but most servers don't allow it) -don't save ammo when reloading (i have 29/30 ammo in a mag and I reload and the 29 bullets are gone) -realistic damage model (1 hit headshot, 1-2 body shot etc.)  Cons: -Crashes on mac sometimes -Not very many players 1000-2000",

Here we take the role of either the Security forces (USA) or the Insurgents in a thrilling multiplayer game.  I always get an itch for this type of game ever since I played the original Rainbow Six back in the day. The simulator esc shooter where one a bullet or two can take you out, the sound of bullets makes you ♥♥♥♥ your pants. Going low and prone is often a life saviour. Not to mention the stress inducing darkening of the screen as you come under fire. This game can be downright harrowing, COD this is not; fast? At times, but you need to pick your shots, many modes make you wait to re-spawn increasing the need to think about where you are what you’re doing and what’s the next best move.  The game has fair few modes from single life modes like Strike and Ambush to Battlefield esc modes with waves such as Push and Occupy. It even has a co-op vs bots mode that can be really challenging, from survival to a checkpoint challenge. There is no levelling up, rather a unique reward system where you given a point each round and can use it on your equipment or weapon making things flexible in the sense you can try be a tank with heavy armour or a speedy run and gun solider of fortune.   If you like Arma or the old shooters like Ghost recon and Rainbow six this may be the shooter for you it’s a nice balance between realism and arcade shooter fun. I have very few gripes even worth mentioning. The weapons are too few in my opinion I know this is an indie title but there could be more. At times it all becomes to much there a small group of players who are insanely good , they will show no mercy to new players which may turn newcomers off if they are unlucky enough to join some of those guys servers. The community is all over the place there are trolls there and people way to keen for their own good but generally speaking it’s not hard to find a game and most of the players are easy enough going.   I Highly recommended this game its one of my favourite shooters out there and I hope more developers take note on how to make a fun well balanced first person shooter that can also be realistic.

It also manages to keep you motivated even if your team lost once or twice because it's always possible to adapt your tactics to the enemy team and develop.   9/10",

More gear = slower. 1 head shot = dead. 1 - 3 shots (depends on what gun you are using) = dead. You have no kills indicator. Overall, it is a great game however, the AI seems to be lacking and there is pretty much no AI snipers. Two major problems with this game is that the game crashes all the time on Macs for some reason - especially when a new map loads and the resolution is absolutely terrible (although the graphics are pretty good).

I've never been able to run this fluidly on any PC i have owned, but now they fixed alot of stuff. Runs really good now.

Audio is great, your radios will allow you to talk with the rest of your squad, however if you say something when an enemy is close, they can hear you also... The only improvement I would like to see is the ability to change the radio volume separately to the rest of the 'sound effects' volume. Player voice chat is controlled seperately to sound effect volume.  Differences to most shooters: 1. Respawns. Depending on the mode, you will run out of respawns in different ways. Some maps give your team a limited number of respawns that you can replenish by capturing/destroying objectives. Other maps only will respawn your team when you capture or destroy an objective. Other maps you get given a limited number of respawns and can't replenish them.  This makes the game MUCH more team-based, as by yourself you will die quickly 2. Health. You don't regenerate it. You will often die from only one or two bullets, and you often have very little idea where you were shot from. This makes your individual tactical approach, as well as your teams strategy, much more important. If you run in the open, you die quickly.  3. Weapons. You get 'supplies' which are used to purchase weapons and upgrades. You can fit different sights, ammunition, barrels, grips and accessories to weapons, you can purhase different types of armour and grenades. You often need to balance what you want, as you don't have enough supplies to get the best of everything. Capturing objectives can give you more supplies.  The only thing that I really dislike about the game is that there are some 'restricted areas' where the game prevents you from being able to shoot. This is designed to keep you playing near the objectives, but sometimes can be painful as you cannot visually see where they start or finish, so sometimes you will run for cover and find yourself in an area that you can't defend yourself in.  Overall a fun game with a steep learning curve and something I would recommend to any other FPS fan.",

After a recent sale, when the game was for 2 dollars I decided to play this game again...  Here is a brief gameplay for EVERY match IN EVERY server now:  You spawn, thinking that you should help you teammates and push it to the objective, or defend it, depending on your side. After making few steps you see 2-3 RPG missiles going towards your direction - you die. You spawn again - make few steps - and again RPG kills you. Well, lets try again. Somehow you survived another RPG only to make another few steps and die from grenade. But you are stubborn and decide to try again... After many attampts, surviving RPG and grenades, you make it to the objective. You kill camper in the corner and start capturing. RPG and grenades are constantly hitting the wall you are hiding befind and you think that you are fine... gues what - C4 and you die again.  Basically this game now looks more like a Quake 3 or Unreal Tournament. Guns are usless because you die long before you see anyone. Both teams just spamming RPG, Grenades and C4 and the only sound you hear during the play is the sound of explosions. There are almost no gunshots. So I would call this game 'the world of explosives' or 'The world of RPG'  If you are looking for a realistic shooter - avoid this game and play Red Orchestra.",

This game, from what I understand, is a first-person shooter that has controls and abilities beyond other games for it's 'real' life similarity.  A nice game if you a adept to first-person shooters already, but if you're just starting out, maybe something like Combat Arms, Cross Fire, or CS:GO would be a better fit.  Insurgency, taking account of it's release date, does not have very good mechanics. I mean, it's 2015 (2014 of release). For some reason, whatever reason, a C4 explosion can kill you even if you're behind a wall. Of course, this must be very close, but, logically, that makes no sense. At least a huge health hit would be better, not an instant-kill. For some reason, the graphics, although many parts wonderful, looks as if it's the child of CS:S and CS:GO. Just add in the dust everywhere and you're set to create 'Insurgency'.  Did I mention you die REALLY GOD DAMN QUICK in this game? Seriously. Three shots of anything could basically kill you. Hey, are you lying on the floor trying to cross map an enemy? Huh? You didn't see that guy to the left? Oh! He just shot you and you died. Welps!  Also, team mates and enemies are almost identical in their colors. I actually team killed the first time I went into a bot game. Yes, a bot game. I could hardly see any name tags (didn't see any), so I assumed it was an enemy. Two shots, dead. Later on, a bot rushed in and three shot me, less than a second, and I was dead.  But hey, I guess this relates to real life, right?  I'm not trying to say that this game is bad. It's not. I personally just did not like it, even refunded (so long, Terraria). Like all games, not everyone will enjoy it to the same degree. I find faults with this game that made it a deal breaker. I do not recommend this game to anyone who is already good, or playing, other first-person shooters. You will not enjoy the experience on Insurgency, and it will not help you improve on your other first-person shooter games. I do recommend you try it for yourself, just buy it on Steam, play for a hour or so, and then refund it. Remember that the refund limit is 2 hours.",

Now I know people ♥♥♥♥ on COD (I do), but in terms of mechanics it has some of the most fluid controls out there, and Insurgency feels even better to me. This game will always keep you on your toes and thinking, as it is 2-3 shot kill at most. It is a harsh yet balanced game.  The various gamemodes force teams to actually play together in order to win. A team of sup-par players can consistently win against players of higher skill if they work together and the other team doesn't. This tactical gameplay is one of the most enjoyable parts of the game. Unlike other FPS where you just mindlessly shoot, die, respawn, Insurgency forces you to treasure every life you are given (as they are few and sometimes far between) and work with people.  This review may make it sound like this game is serious or hardcore, and it is, but if you play with friends it can be a real blast. Also, the devs constantly release new content (guns, maps, gamemodes) for free because they freaking rock.",

Also, I wouldn't suggest this game if you do not have a few friends to play with. Why? Beating the other team relies on communication just as much as it does hitting a fatal shot on your target.   Fire fights in this game are about as intense as it gets. Players are killed with 1-2 bullets so developing a plan to get a jump on your target is essential. You do not need to have your target in plain view to make shooting at them meaningful. There is a suppression mechanic in this game that will make a players screen turn blurry when they are receiving fire behind cover. Communicating to a team mate to move up on a target that is being suppressed is not only strategic but extremely rewarding.   This game will have you on the edge of your seat.

I used to play CS back when it was a mod in 1998! I played the original release. I would come and go over the years, but eventually dropped it completely. WIth the recent Holiday sale I decided to give CS:GO a shot and was disappointed to discover just how little the game has evolved. I suppose that is purposeful given the community, but for me I was bored by the gameplay, and graphics that still to me at least... feel small... like all the people are little action figures running around... compared to other games with more detailed models/scale/weighty physics. But this isn't about CS...  I bought Insurgency Four pack because I've been having fun playing with my friends in various games lately and damn was I ever happy.  I've seen the game kicking around on Steam since it was released roughly two years ago and now I wish I bought it sooner. I always figured it was kind of a CS clone... but it REALLY ISN'T. This game is EXACTLY what I want. Realism! Fun! The weapons feel incredible, the gameplay feels realistic, the sound design was awesome. I really enjoy the level design and game modes. And all of this has only been in 4 hours of game time thus far. It has exceeded my expectations. My first impression was that if felt like a moderized Rainbow Six Rogue Spear but faster and more fun in general. But it really is its own thing and a better game than that ever was. I love that you never actually know for certain if you've killed someone in the distance or behind a wall unless you see the body hit the ground. No kill messages, no gamey interface, it is great. The levels are great medium size for fast but realistic gameplay.   Totally recommend for anyone that likes realistic gameplay that is also reasonably fast paced. I'm surprised by the metacritic rating. It deserves higher, and the USER reviews rating IS higher. Funny since it is usually the opposite with most games, with AAA games getting hyped/paided off high ratings and then the users give the real story. Well with this game the users have given the real story and it is great. No idea how many hours I'll put into this but wow, what a great first impression.",

Pros: &gt; Beautiful graphics, not too much or too low, any medium-rated rig can run it without any lags. &gt; Weapons and weapon customizations! There are lots of weapons to choose, also lots of customizations! You can add silencers, any scope, foregrip (also add a flaslight, point it into enemies eyes and make them blind; the excellent tactic) etc. etc. &gt; Being a sniper. &gt; The game forces you to communicate and be patient. You can rarely win with a team which has no communication. &gt; It's a game where you think like in weekends; ''Oh, I played all the games on my computer now, except this Insurgency.'' and just get into it. No raging teammates, no ''de-ranking'' stress, only this beautiful, slow game.  Cons: &gt; Can't really think one right now. The game was just flawless to me.

Possibly great game let down by archaic server management and ridiculous fixation on constant action by making map sizes extremely tiny. Why bother having the sniper class if half the time the game is about running from checkpoint to checkpoint down alleyways besides being a camper and just sitting at spawn trying to pick off spawning AI.  AI can spot you through the tiniest cracks and responds within a fraction of a second, AI immediately knows where you are after the first shot and relocating.  AI's snap to target function and ridiculous one shot on kill mechanism while my own guns sway left and right and even has shots landing outside of scope's reticle.  Multiplayer coop is ridiculously boring half the time with teams just lemming rushing straight across the field.   Impossible to host a server where the only people that can join are those in my LAN network, fiddling around with CMDs,BAT files and all sorts of funny programming stuff only further aggravates the issue. I have setup servers for half a dozen other games and non of them comes close to this frustrating with zero troubleshooting capabilities.",

Good stuff: - it's a tactical shooter in the sense that you can't just run around aimlessly shooting people in the face to win, instead having to learn the maps and watch corners, planning your next move, at least on competitive; - the maps are not too big and encourage a more carefull way of playing, throwing off 'run and gun' type of players and giving room to the more skillfull type of players; - the damage model is realistic, which might be a turn on for hardcore FPS players; - team work is also encouraged in competitive mode due to the benefits of providing information and coordenating moves; - balanced weight loadout system with fairly realistic guns and tools, all usefull in some way; - there's a coop gamemode, definitely fun for playing with a friend.  Bad Stuff: - the high damage model makes the tme to kill rather short, which might be frustrating when getting into the game; - the maps, while providing a lot of fun tactical gameplay, together with the damage model also encourage camping, which might also create some frustrating moments; - there´s no singleplayer (the game is totally multiplayer focused and for me thats excelent, but it could be a downside for other players).  It's a fun multiplayer experience with a doubt, with many hours to enjoy alone or with a friend (recommended)",

            "review_text": "Insurgency the legend of tacticalnesses as i say do i recomend it? for some people and let me explain:  basicly Insurgency is one of those games where if you run out in the open like a ♥♥♥♥ing luni you're gonna get shot up by a sniper down range so tacticalnesses is key you need to be undercover and sneaky flank the unobvious spots and if you do fight out in the middle of the batle stay low and dont rush in instead let the enemy make the first move.  so why did i just explain how to play the game? well if you come from a game life csgo and you're instinct is to rush ♥♥♥♥ then this aint the game for you unless if you're willing to take in some new mechanics and game style then buy it.  anyway enough about why certain people should get the game let me explain why i love this game alot.  so Insurgency in my opinion alows you to jump into smooth servers with good fps and realistic like game style the surrounding within the game looks nice and 'camofladged' so by that i mean it alows you to use the map to you're advantage easier so i absolutely love that in a game. Also i love how the game isn't based on being the 1 guy on your team who ♥♥♥♥s everyone up and carries the game is much more team based so you can use comms to you're advantage which can prove very helpful within a FPS stratigic game. The gun mechanics are very exiting and well put together so you are able to have a chance against a long range sniper or a close range attacker you can change the fire type or whatever you call it so you can go burst fire fully auto or semi auto which well help with long range battles diffrent scopes attachments which will give you a stratigic advantage to help you with diffrent play styles. Finaly i'd like to review the buying system which i find quite interesting basicly per round you get a spending coin thingy which goes towards you're guns,attachments,grenades and armour. personaly i find this a very clever choice for a game like this mostly because it alows new people to the game to have equal firepower against a more expereinced play and also i think that it makes it more fair in firefights because you could have a sniper which is really experienced which has all of the attachments for his sniper and everything else but with the mechanic they have put in it will make it more equal so that wont happen.  So i know i said finnaly earlier but i have somthing quick to adress to people who buy the game from personal experience i have had a glitch where i get no XP or K/D ratio showing up after a game now the only thing you can use that for is braging rights so it isnt that bad but thought i might adress it and also i got told by some friends that if you download it for the first time and put all you video settings to what you normaly have eg. 1680x1080p high (texture settings) etc. then it'll crash you're whole gmae which will cause you to REINSTALL IT so yeah just make sure that you dont do that unless if you want to reinstall it after you just bought it.  Anyway hope that review helped some people who are interested in the game and yeah enjoy the game....",

On the other hand I belive that this is better than 'Counter Strike: Global Offensive' or as kids from 10+ say: CS:GO...Anyway going back on topic this game does have less younger children personally thats a good thing because all that happens is they will cause the loss of the game especially during multiplayer and/ or Co-Op.   Just so its clear you can get mods/ skins/ replacement weapons for this game in the workshop the game does make a huge difference. My friends and i have been playing for quite a while ever since I joined 'Steam'. I usually play Co-Op which is basically you and other members playing against 'Bots'. On modified servers you will find a lot of cutoms maps, a few new weapons, more or less supply for customization (depending on your server) and much more.   The bottom line is, if you wanted this game BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!!  You can use mics and/ or headsets in this game. My friends would throw Molotovs, grenades, flashbangs, and even smokes and still yell either 'BONZAIIIII' or 'Allahu Akbar'.....Those goofballs....hahaha   Play on modded serves b/c they give you a better sense of how the game should really be find serves such as 'Sernix 24/7' or 'Weekend Warriors'.....Trsut me you'll have a blast!!!!!!",

This might sound silly however the game does require you to be methodical and approach objectives cooperatively and make sure you get the angles covered. It’s not as fluid as Call of Duty but it’s not as clunky as Arma. Weapons are hitscan but the ranges you engage targets at do not really make this much of an issue. Fans of deep tactical shooters should not be put off by this statement though as hardcore features exist throughout. Such things like elements of the HUD being hidden during combat. There are no crosshairs and the weapons operate in free aim mode meaning when you move your mouse your weapon model moves around the screen a bit and never sit in the same place. Also weapons collide with surfaces, meaning you need to be careful how you position yourself. I highly recommend the game and for the price there is no excuse for this game not to be a part of any true PC FPS gamer's collection.",

Really wish there were more games like this the bullet damage is realistic you get hit your close to death or in some cases depending on were the bullet hit your dead.  So as for bad things about it, I'd say more weapons would be a nice adition, increase ammo load and grenade load would be better.

Get it yourself by switching roles!). What is also nice is the Steam workshop support, which holds a vast array of player models and gun skins, as well as maps, which at the moment have custom servers running for the said maps. Another cool thing are the servers hosted for mods such as the Day of Infamy mod, which creates a WW2 environment including maps, guns, and player skins, hosted on dedicated servers. How ever, it is suggested for use on a good computer, but turning down your graphics is no biggy (while what you may see in your scope might be chunkier, it still works well enough to pick off baddies). What I also find helping is shutting off unnecessary apps (mostly anything other than Insurgency and Steam). Definitely a well built game for lets see, 1... 2... 3... 15 US dollars.

I've met many great people on this game and even had a small group of people that I played this with almost exclusively. They don't play much these days but most people return to the servers they were last on so you can make friends by going back over and over, most of the time you'll find good reason to play on the same server, friendly competition is fun.

            "review_text": "So far so good, sadly haven't played multiplayer yet, I can tell this game is sooo made for co-op tho... while the enemy bots can be difficult and sometimes their aim is ridiculiously good, better than my spelling... your allied teammates (bot wise) leaves much more to be desired, and not in the sense that they're good but in the sense they're soo bad and act more like cannon-fodder than anything else. The inability to add more allied bots sucks too, not because I want to kill all realism of a covert mission but because your fellow bot allies are likely to die quickly. This game has a lot of potential, and if it implemented a stealth machanic to the AI that would be terrific, but atm all they do is give away your position and aim worse than a storm trooper while doing so... always needing to carry the team becomes a drag after a while, and the only use I get from them is if I do die, I can possess their bodies and take over, which is a great idea I've been waiting for someone to actually use in a game.  TL:DR? Great game so far but solo gaming needs some serious improvement.  carrying on with my review, if my bot allies were able to know where my gun is pointing whenever I'm aiming down it so they don't obstruct my view, if they actively sought out objectives or better yet, gave me the ability to give them orders like in Rainbow Six, awesome! and if they actually aimed better than enemy AI, they are meant to be like special forces or something aren't they? So it would make sense if their ability is atleast, slightly better than your foes so you don't feel like the babysitter all the time, AWESOME!... I would recommend you buy this game, IF, you have wired connection for good ol multiplayer against strangers over the net, or if you have friends to game with who have it too... otherwise you might end up eventually breaking your keyboard and using colorful language since I'm pretty sure this isn't call of duty, and so neither is it designed for you to be the one man army, and if you're like me, you like games that feel balanced to some realism at least.",

The co-op is pretty fun, and is guaranteed to keep you entertained for a while; I'd guess at least 10 hours, probably more, but if you're only interested in co-op then you might want to look for another game because this game is strongest in multiplayer. Now the game isn't perfect, and I do have a few problems with it. First of all, just a few maps tend to be the most dominantly played, so they can sometimes feel a little repetative. Secondly, in the Push game mode, the Security Forces are the attackers probably 3 out of every 4 maps, and push tends to be heavily defender-biased, so Insurgent forces probably win the majority of the time. Third, Sinjar. Yes, just Sinjar. Really though, it can be a pretty fun game. There are several classes to choose from on each team, and each class has access to 3 or 4 different weapons out of a pool of probably 10 or so, plus lots of additional gear like a few different sights, silencers, and different grenades. Not every class has access to the same gear, so everybody can't spam silencers, for example. You can select your gear using Supply Points, which starts at 10 in multiplayer (15 in co-op) and increases by 1 point each round. Guns, armor, gear and different types of ammo all cost supply points, so it's important to choose what's most important to you carefully. Overall, I'd rate this game about 8.5/10.",

Graphically the game isn't too shabby. Some maps look almost as good as Battlefield 3, others to me look like incomplete CS Source maps to me. Gun models look great and sound great, which really helps build the ambiance for this game, so even if some maps don't look photo realistic, they feel like an actual firefight area. Particles really bring everything together like no other game out there imo.   Performance isn't too great in this game, or at least not as good as you would expect. While in most other Source games I'm usually staying over 120 fps without many drops below 100 and almost none under 60, Insurgency runs a little wonky, averaging around 80 fps with drops here and there below 60. However, running the game on lowest settings nets performance increases similar to other Source games. You can most likely run this game just fine if you are running an intergrated gpu from an i5 6600.  Community is hit or miss. You just need to find the right server and meet the right people. If someone is spamming their mic, it's very easy to mute them. I've only met a hacker once in my entire time while playing the game, who was eventually banned. A lot of the people who complain about hackers play on the same servers which hackers probably frequent. If you stick to clan servers it's very unlikely for a hacker to join.  Overall the game is a great value. I'd recommend this to anyone that plays a lot of CS, Arma or Red Orchestra because this game is a nice middleground between these 3 games. It's constantly on sale and imo even at 15 bucks it's a steal for how much content it has.",

Runs perfectly on my system. Only issues were with 'Soft Particles'  Engine - For being based on Source, this game is pretty advanced, and like I said, gorgeous game.  Real Teamwork - Here's the best part. This game forces you to work together, if you don't, you'll fail. And the characters will speak to each other so you will do what is required of you. It's awesome.  Fear - This game, is realistic. It's actually intense. It's crazy.   Dialogue - The dialogue is amazing. The way they talk and stuff is quite hilarious.  Why it's arguably not the best -  AI - The AI are just a little dumb and/or rigged SOMETIMES. Not always.  Community - As of now, sadly this game isn't as big as it should be.

            "review_text": "(An updated review)  A Tactical FPS set in a modern middle-eastern setting, it was one of the best games for its price at $15, now its a crime to get this game at its price of $10. Funny enough, I originally got this game along with others during a sale I believe, and really didn't expect to play much of it, that being around one and a half years ago. Now, its practically one of the only games I play often, partly because the multplayer is amazing as well as the mechanics of the game.  Firstly, the mechanics of the game are amazing and feel realistic and authentic while not being a mil sim like ARMA for example (not that it's a bad thing, but this game has similar faster pased FPS mechanics with other games but maintains more realism, despite not being as complex as mil sims). Generally 1-2 shots to the chest or 1 to the head are enough to kill someone, of course depending on the weapon and ammo type. A makorov pistol without any hp or armor piercing ammo will take many shots to kill someone at a longer range for example, but a Mosin or FAL with armor piercing would kill most things in one shot. That said, the damage model is obviously very high, with 1-2 shots at medium ranges being the general number of shots to down an enemy. There is no regenerating health, and if you want tp get health back you have to resupply, as well as getting more ammo for you gun. There are no crosshairs so aiming down sights is the only way to know where your shots are going most of the time, if you control your recoil. Hipfire is free aim making it harder to shoot people with initially, especially for me when I first played it thinking it would shoot in the middle of the screen like most FPS, but if you train your hipfire with a laser sight and adjust your hipfire sensitivities, you'll have a HUGE advantage over other players in PvP, as well as PvE to some extent. If you run out of ammo and don't resupply at your last spawn, you can collect other weapons on the ground with F, but if the gun doesn't share your ammo or gun type, then you won't get the mags the other player was carrying but just whatever was left in the gun, forcing players to more or less stick to their loadouts from their specific classes (which there are plenty anwyways) unless in a pinch, which is a good thing (so that not everyone can have 30 rounds for a sniper rifle they pick up etc.). That said, there's a lot of customization for each class, as they typically have several guns to chose from, as well as atachments such as different types of holoscppes with different magnifiyers, barrel attachments like a heavy barrel or supressor, underbarrel attachments like a bipod or foregrip, extended mags, different ammo types, etc. This also applies to secondary weapons although to a lesser extent, and there is also further customization with nades including frags, smokes, and flashes, chest rigs to carry more ammo and nades, and light and heavy armor to survive more damage. This means that there is always a loadout to suit your class for the situation, so even if you're a sniper, if there is an objective which doesn't faciliate or benefit from sniping, you can adjust your loadout to have a gun with a less magnified scope or a weapon that is better in close quarters. Furthermore, weight should also be kept into consideration, as more nades, heavier weapons, and armor adds to your weight, and depending on your class and playstyle, it might be better to use less supplies for armor or chestrigs etc for more speed; this is especially crucial in gamemodes like push, and light armor is most likely best over heavy armor. Classes are extremely important and even if you're team isn't directly communicating, such as in a pub, performing your role of your class is extrememly effective, such as deploying smoke grenades from your gun as demolitions, or giving supressive fire as support/machinegunner. In terms of the HUD, it's very minimalistic, you have the objective location, number of waves of your team (depending on gamemode), time left, and what objectives there are and what objectives are being capped (depending on gamemodes etc.). There is no mini-map, yet with the 'n' key by default, you can display a map of the current map and friendly locations, as well as a coordinate grid. Being supressed makes your display significantly blurrier, and in rare instances (such as being supressed in close quarters) can give you such limited vision that it can make it difficult to see in front of you sometimes. Generally however, being supressed isn't too annoying yet is quite effective, and can make it harder to aim or focus. Supression is even helpful at determining if you're being shot at, especially from longer distances, along with the sound cracks and sounds of bullets whizzing by your head.  In terms of PvP, it is pretty well balanced most of the time, with several gamemodes for each map, the most common one being push (although I wouldn't say the best in my opinion). Push is one of the most simple of gamemodes, and is most common in pubs and 32 player servers; basically in Push one team must run and capture and objective while the defending team must stop them, with there being 3 objectives and a final cache and each objective capture granting more waves and time for the offensive team. Push can especially be chaotic, but luckily the maps always grant numerous oppurtunities to each objective. That said, many inexperienced players will probably stick to the same route each time using the exact same loadout rushing the same place until dieing each time, which can be the most frustrating thing having bad players on the offensive side. Defenders don't have to change their strategies too much during a game of push if it works, thus more teamwork is required on those pushing, yet the gamemode is still balanced as the maps allow several ways to confront the objectives despite new players going the most obvious route. This also segways into another topic, which is the maps. All maps are well polished and fun, but can be extrememly complex (Tell comes to mind), and as a new player, I would imagine it being extrememly frustrating and aggrivating your first time playing PvP, especially with no kill cams and the like. Knowing the maps is part of the learning curve of Insurgency, as well as its mechanics, but mastering both are satisfying, but consider the warning of an initial learning curve as it may scare newer players, especially those more used to games like CoD or even Battlefield off. Even when dying, the chaos and sounds of the warzone still makes it fun seeing death from your perspective morbidly engaging, as well as seeing your teammates die spectaculary while in front of you or spectating them; either way the immersion will still keep you hooked despite your skill. There are also nighttime versions of the maps which are also fun, adding a new dynamic of using nvg goggles, flashlights, or flare guns and altering your enemies' perception of light to your advantage. Besides 32 player matches, there are also 24 player matches under tactical operations which are often filled with more experienced players and more tactical gamemodes, in which each person is given a single life unless an objective is captured. If you bought Insurgency for its tactical gameplay, servers under Tactical Operations will probably be what you're looking for, as the game is more methodical and slower paced. There is also 5v5 competitive modes which I haven't played too much of and it's a bit more experimental at the moment, but its another option to play PvP (not even mentioning custom servers). PvE is also good and lots of people play it exclusively as well. There is also infinite free skins and maps on the workshop, as well as updates from the devs too, and as my character limit is running out all I can say is that I give this game one of the highest reccomendations if you can get pass the learning curve.  I give it 10 Jihads/Allah.",

Kit selection is fun to play with and change your loadouts. Sacraficing points in one area to use them on another.  Sounds seem to be amazing and with new updates things like foot steps are much better and more useable.  Stable, the game is so much more stable then at first early access. I have not had a game crash and the only issue I have now is related to my Mac only. Menu selection sometimes has the mouse disappear and sometimes you can still power through it and other times even when highlighting a menu option I can't still select the option. I don't play a lot on the Mac though, so it doesn't impact me too much.  It feels a lot like America's Army, with some changes like respawns. I normally play with objective based respawns, but there are some wave respawns in certain game mode as well. Which allows for the results to swing at times which is refreshing to me. One guy can take a single objective and that act allows your team to spawn and can turn the tide.  Cons:  Community, like all multiplayer games you still have to deal with the annoyance of not so friendly players. For the most part though it isn't intolerable.  Servers are mostly best of 5, which for me sometimes is a bad thing. On maps I don't care for I really like this, but on competitive matches sometimes it just seems too short.  Lack of teamwork, like stated in the Pros, this game requires teamwork. Which for me is a pro, but when just hoping on for a short time with no buddies playing it can be a con at the same time. If you get on a team that doesn't want to work together, it can be rather frustrating.   Final thoughs:  If you are looking for a combination of America's Army meets Counter Strike then I recommend the game highly. I play CS:GO and Arma 3, two completely dfferent FPS games and this game for me seems like a great middle ground. Not as face paced as CS, but not as slow and sometimes flat out boring as Arma 3.",

If you don't plan on communicating with your team or at the very least following orders from a squad leader and supporting your squad then this probably isnt your style of game.

The Co-op is a blast with friends (hint: use Voip, not chat) and the multiplayer is fun too.   The game has a ways to go before it can really be considered polished, but I had a blast with people who seemed a lot less pissy than they do in games like Counterstrike and the like. It's got a good atmosphere and brutal realism which strongly encourages working together over going it alone, and I've always really been a fan of Insurgency, even when it was in its early stages as a downloadable mod.  It's very easy to become a leader, simply by using your microphone to inform everybody of the situation and to guide players on where they should go. Players seem pretty inclined to listen and play along, instead of just running off on their own to die.  It makes every kill feel very satisfying, and when you and a 'team' on a co-op server clear a map, it results in congratulations all around.   It has some very unique mechanics that simply make it a game worth buying.  The team is doing a really good job bringing this together, and I really wish them the best.",

I really don't like how Insurgency is trying to be both close quarters combat and open range sniper fights with its map selection. Some people like that variety but I don't and would much rather have the maps focus on CQC.  The night maps are also redundant and frustrating, more often than not forcing you to waste precious inventory space on night vision goggles. Don't get me wrong, a couple of the maps like Heights and Ministry are great, but they are in the minority.  I have no problem with the skill ceiling of the game and felt like the classes were relatively balanced with strengths and weaknesses. It was the map design that killed it for me, but that might not be a dealbreaker for you like it was for me. Despite all of that Insurgency is still a good game, it just wasn't the one I could truly sink my teeth into.",

The co op side of the game is more limited as the game has an emphasis on Pvp but its just as good and addictive.  Pros: Gun Sounds are great in this game everything sounds intense. Gun Design is probably the best ive ever come across they put alot of thought into the weapons here. Explosives sound great and seem well proportioned in blast size, relative to what they are. Character movement seems generally fluid and well done. Voice acting is decent and hilarious at times. Alot of custom maps on certain servers. Its just too damn fun!  Cons: Bit buggy in places(grenade launcher rounds dont always go off if shot at something close) Could do with some more weapons(insurgent team is lacking in sub machine guns) Dosnt like being tabbed out then tabbed back in, the rejoining process is jittery with sound going nuts.

There is very little tactical element in the game, although it's supposed to be a highly tactical game. Instead matches quickly devolve into camp-fests, where you just run to the best spot to camp the approach of your enemy. The problem is that most maps are too small to accomodate this type of game. It is suprisingly easy to run over from your spawn to your enemy's spawn and just camp their corridors to not let them get out of their spawnpoint. In some maps, like Panj, you can kill spawning enemies without ever leaving your own spawn point. Both teams will rely heavily on explosives, instead of actual gunplay to achieve their objectives. I sincerely hear more explosions than I hear gunfire in a whole match. C4 will kill everyone in a building (not just a room), and grenade launchers carry up to 6 rifle grenades. Killing a rocketeer or a demolitionman will actually cause more harm than good, since they will respawn with their explosives and spam them. Don't buy this game, you will regret it. It's a shame, because it's a good game, but the way people play it makes it into a very bad game. If you want a tactical experience, go play Red Orchestra 2/Rising Storm. It's essentially the same game, but set during WW2, and with a lot better maps and balance.",

This is not Battlefield 4 (though BF4, out of those 3, resembles this game the most). This game has no health count. This game has no ammo count. This game has no kill cam. This game has no 360 no-scopes. This game has no doritos and mountain dew. This game has camping. This game has realistic mechanics. This game has realistic situations that require teamwork to complete. This game, well, this game is just what it says in the description. Insurgency is 'intense close quarters combat'.   For a first time FPS gamer, this game is not like the rest. If you want to get into FPS gamings, if you want to play tons of FPS games, this game, well, it'll be the one that stands out in the pack, for better or for worse. For me, it's for better. I own CS:GO, and MW3 on the PS3. CS:GO did not appeal to me. MW3 did for a bit, but I got into PC gaming, got more mature, etc., and it lost it's appeal. Since then, I've played games like TF2 and League of Legends. But I felt like I needed a real, non-gimmicky FPS that I could enjoy, come back to, and thoroughly enjoy for hours upon hours.  I've found it.  The gameplay is realistic, fast-paced yet slow enough to build tension, and just overall intense and epic fun. Your K:D ratio will not matter. You'll complete objectives, stop the other team from capping your points. You will die, rage, but continue playing because IT'S JUST THAT FUN.   There are 8 gamemodes in PvP, and 4 co-op, each endless fun, some requiring more skill than others. There are 9 unique and customizable classes for the Security side, and 10 for the Insurgents. Each provide different roles for the team, and each can be used effectively in gameplay.   And the community. Wow. Most FPS games have, well, terrible communities. CoD is full of 10 year olds who have apparently banged your mom. Alrighty then. As does Halo. CS:GO and others like it are full of people who just seem to find other people to hate on always.  This game has it's fairshare of d*ckheads, but it is generally pretty awesome. You'll meet people that give you hope that this community could match up with the likes of the TF2 community, yet smaller and maybe even better. Plus, it takes a sh*tload more skill to be good at this game, so it keeps tons of the 360 no-scope 420 blaze it kids away.  And example of this epic community is found in my friend, his name is 'a cactus'. I refer to him as cactus, because I mean, calling him a cactus is kinda weird. We were defending point B in a Push round, cactus was on the other team. I didn't know him yet. There were about 2 minutes left, and we had leaders in these 2 guys who kind of held our whole team together. Out of nowhere, in the top left corner of the screen, I see, 'Banning [Leader 1]' (forget his real name). I was astonished. He had not been hacking, breaking no rules. He was our best player. Anyway, we continue, and now it's down to about 1 minute where I see, 'Banning [Leader 2]'. Huh? Again, this guy was awesome and was banned by the other team because they wanted an advantage over us. Long story short, our team collapsed without those two and they took B, proceeded to take C, and then destroyed our cache.  After the game, I got a friend invite from cactus. I asked him who he was. He said he was on the other team, and said what they did was pretty sh*tty and, for the record, he voted no to ban those two guys. He said they were trying to ban our best players so they could win. I was annoyed and upset. It was the first time I had seen anything like that in the Insurgency community.  But cactus showed to me how good this community really is, he showed me that this game's community is really top notch. There are tons of guys like cactus around this community.  When you begin, though, you will find the mechanics hard to grasp, the guns hard to aim, etc. Find a class that works for you, keep trying with it, try different scopes, ammo, etc. on the guns, and just keep at it. My first kill was a lucky headshot on Panj, while I was in prone. I couldn't believe it. I died, like, 3 seconds later. I didn't get a kill for another day. Now, I get MVP, learned to play the objectives. I got 330 points in a game today. And I've only played this game for about 25 hours. Jeez.  That about wraps up my review. Please. Do not hesitate to get this game. It is probably the best $15 buy I've ever made on a game. Get it.  tl;dr: get this game. seriously. do it now.",

Almost real damage simulation (at least there is no '4 glock hits - no kill' like in CS:GO). When in close combat, 75% chance you will kill the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with a spray of bullets if well managed.  You get actually suppresed when under heavy fire, and bullets do actually spread out and pull smoke all over the place.  There are very few cheaters (did not found one yet) and it is really hard to 'smurf' or carry a whole team, you will may get a great score, but you will lose if you do not focus on objectives - teamwork.   The maps are just the right size not to be studied corner by corner, but also not to be bored because of large distances. You will be firing, running and mostly crouching all the time. Campers die easily when pushed (real grenade damage - unlike CS:GO).  If you run around trying to get frags like in CoD, you instantly die. Also, the snipers are not so overpowered like in other games. Smokes really work and it is also possible to easily shoot the snipers back with a rifle. Also, there will not be more than 1 sniper every 12 players, you are always forced to choose from a variety of squad fighters with different equipment. You will be fully equiped from the very beginning too - no more eco rounds.  It is also possible to grab anything you find on the floor ;) Furthermore, if you are carrying heavy stuff, you will run slower... ALL THE TIME! (no more knife switching)  The weapons and bullet impacts sound much better than in other games, more realistic recoil, more firingpower feel.  All weapons are actually usefull in the right hands. No bullet counter, no reloading while running, no crossfire (only laser pointer addon - they will spot you really fast)  + Nightfighting :D! actual flashlight/ nightvision simulation :D :D :D   It runs on poor systems like mine (1000$ - 2013 Vaio laptop), which will make this game popular, anyway, it is already full enough of players. You know, gameplay &gt; graphics (which are good enough though).   The different game objectives are also fun to play, and the fraggers will die in hell with very poor scores (10 points/frag, 100 points/objective).

When playing coop against computer controlled enemies you never feel safe, always being on edge. The same is with human players. And this is what the game is all about. Think, don't rush, be cautious, shoot only when you are sure you land one.   One big downside is - if you are playing on Mac, be prepared for a lot of crashes. This is very annoying, especially when you find a good players, only to find yourself to get dropped from the game. What a bummer.   Graphics: 6/10  Sound: 9/10 Atmosphere: 10/10  Worth buying?

You will find that taking time scoping the area and checking corners in groups will benefit 100% rather then sprinting ahead and rushing without your team to score some kills as those actions will be very punishing- mostly to your team as in most game modes players have one life only and 2 bullets are enough to kill you.  Insurgency is a different game, it steps away from generic shooters and creates a whole new experience, every victory is very satisfying, and every defeat can teach you how to change your tactics and adapt to your enemy.  Gun customization is also balanced, players will have to choose what attachments they want on their weapons based on their gameplay, many times in order to have your favourite attachment or equipment you will have to sacrifice something else like a secondary weapon or a different expensive attachment like a suppressor.  The game runs smooth, the graphics are beautiful and very fitting, the use of very (and I mean VERY) limited HUD and lack of kill feed (some servers will have those, but by default it's turned off) create an immersive experience. _________  Like every game there will be some bugs and some game's features are kind of unclear such as when you look at the map (with the N button by default) you don't always see your position very clearly. BUT so far Devs have been updating the game and fixing problems.  I'm not going to score the game, but I believe everyone should try Insurgency even for few hours. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes FPS games as its very likely Insurgency will be a new and fresh experience for them them.",

Your character is screaming bloody murder as your squad screeches orders at you to go to an enemy cache and destroy it. All this while your screen blurs from incoming sniper, machine gun, and AK-47 fire being rained down on you. 1 shot and your dead with most guns. I liked this a lot. You have to be so much more tactical and actually have to work with your team. All in all 5 stars and would recommend to anyone who enjoys the Battlefield or Call of Duty franchise but is looking for a bit more of a realistic experience.

Even with a small team these guys were able to topple the giants aka 'COD' 'BF'. It's so refreshing to see a game where the devs actually care. These devs have been constantly involved with the game, providing frequent improvements and updates based on community feedback. And the best thing is.... They aren't charging for us for it. Where other companies try to squeeze every last doller out of the consumer, New World Interactive just keeps on giving.   Now lets go through the pros and cons;   Pros:   Modding Community Sound design Co-op UI Gunplay, guns actually have recoil :)  Optimisation - I'm running the game on max settings at 1440p and getting 140fps average!!!   Cons: Can be very challenging and unforgiving for new players   Overall I give Insurgency a 9.5/10",

            "review_text": "As a real-life gun enthusiast and gun owner, i can tell you that this game's realism is just about as real as they come. What do i mean? Let me explain.  The guns. I'm one of those guys that watches every person holding a gun in any movie and nitpicks how they're handling the weapon. The guns are insanely realistic, from the way you load the magazines, to the way they sound (I own the semi auto version of the AC556 and i can tell you it sounds just like it does in real life), to the recoil. You wanna rock full auto? You better prepare yourself for a ton of recoil and virtually no accuracy, just like in real life.   Also, another small detail is how the character models keep their finger off the trigger when they're reloading or crawling on the ground with their weapon. Critical rule of real life gun safety: keep your finger off the trigger until you're ready to fire. It's just cool stuff like that that makes me really like this game.  Also really like how one or two shots usually takes someone down, which is pretty realistic, depending on where you would hit your target. Got shot in the legs? That'll slow you down and you probably wont have time to get cover, and you'll die.   Also like how when you're looking through a scope, only what you see THROUGH the scope is magnified, not the entire world outside the scope as in every other game. Another cool little feature.  Teamwork and communication wins here. Watch every corner, don't run around like a fool or you'll die.   If you want the most realistic close quarters FPS game, this is it, and I've played a lot of them, from gamecube Medal of honors and PC's BF2, to a ton of F2P FPS's, to battlefield 3 and 4 and COD Black Ops, etc. Everything feels authentic here. Is it perfect? No. Is it really close? Yes. ",

But it also has the arcade-like experience you'd find in say, Battlefield or CS:GO. Graphically the game is fairly decent, especially for a non-AAA title, and stuff like SweetFX and Reshades can certainly enhance the game even more. Game sizes are pretty sweet, its not as confined as the 6v6 CoD hallways, but it's also not the massive war-zones with 64 players on each side as found in the Battlefield series. This may sound like a bad thing but it's actually extremely enjoyable, you still have the practicality of all types of weaponry, but it's also not a game where you HAVE to have explosives in case of a random M1A2 or Tunguska ruining your day. Maps aren't really all that diverse compared to other shooters seeing how it specifically takes place in the Iraq-Syria region, but it's got everything, small riverside towns, urban debris-ridden metropolises, massive foreign affairs facilities, woodlands, snow-capped villages, you name it, just don't expect to be fighting in the Wall Street Exchange or Fisher's Market of Hong Kong or something. Insurgency is a game that is simultaniously suited for everyone and no-one, seeing as how the 'hardcore' damage and systems seem to turn off many would-be players, but for those who do take it upon themselves, you'll have a blast. Now have a small tutorial on how to make scrambled eggs cause imma make some right now.  1: You'll need 1-3 eggs tops and olive oil, at least that's what I use, salt is optional but recommended. If you don't have all that fancy stuff, just get a bowl, a decent sized fork and a pan.  2: Once all the egg stuff is in the bowl, you're gonna want to start mixing and spinning it with the fork, do this for about 30-45 seconds.  3: Once the egg is decently mixed you can put it on the pan BUT be sure to apply the olive oil on the pan first.  4: Keep an eye on it, flip it around cause thats how a pan works. Spatula highly recommended.  5: Once it's decently cooked, extract it with the spatula and you're done. I suggest getting toasted bread or tortillas to handle the scrambled eggs, good for extra flavor as well.",

The game seems to have a great mix of tactics and skill allowing players who lack in one to compensate with the other. Unlike BattleField or other shooters this game allows the possibility to really be a one man army if given the chance. The damage model is trying to emulate realism and therefore a single player could take out an entire team if he played well. In games like BattleField or newer CoD games it takes more or less an entire clip to take out an enemy.

INSURGENCY IS A GOOD GAME!  Maps are really good and balanced, there are no 'sweet spots' where you could camp and keep taking enemies down, although some paths are more 'safe' than others. If your enemy has a routine, there is always a way to make them pay for that. ;)  When you are trying the game first time try to keep up with the rest of the team, keep out of open and if you hear a granade thrown - run and take cover!

Each weapon has an effective range making the fire rate of a bolt action worth it, and with there being a lot of fire selectable/semi auto firearms (especially with the DOI mod) this gives character and preference to each rifle. Aiming and accuracy is great and realistic, damage is well mapped and balanced (you're gonna get a guaranteed kill with anything point blank to the head, but you're not gonna be sniping with a pistol)  I highly reccommend trying cooperative modes too, the bot AI is as good as human logic, even more difficult than multiplayer on harder settings.

Buy Insurgency.   This game hits every one of the checkboxes for a modern competitive shooter.   You can expect quick, satisfying combat. Every bullet means something when just  one  can have you taking a dirt nap. Your movements must be deliberate, but quick. You need to be conscious of your enemies' surroundings without a mini-map. Being immersed is an advantage in Insurgency. The game has excellent sound design, type 'snd_obstruction_enable 1' to enable audio occlusion, which sounds that come through walls to sound muffled, super awesome. Maps are balanced and beautiful too, especially considering the game runs on the dated, but still viable Source engine.  Do yourself a huge favor and pick up Insurgency the next time it is on sale (or even at full price).     Highly recommended.  ",

There`s a huge weapon variety and you can configurate each one of your firearms under realistic and fair conditions. There are many classes to choose from, each supporting their own weapon arsenal and gear. There`s an player limit to every class, so there are never to many snipers or machine gunners on the battlefield - talking about battlefields, there are many maps to play on, each having their own flair, advantages and disadvantages - and thats great.

The graphics are okay, although there's room for improvements skin-wise (more detailed skins, more varieties on the skins), physics-wise, and effects-wise (with the latter 2 being the most noticeable downside for me). The devs should tone down the ragdoll when a character gets killed, and lower the particle intensity when bullets hit the wall / ground while they're at it. The gameplay is fun, especially when you get the hang of the controls and weapon characteristics. The game pushes you to make quick tactical decisions absent from other faster paced shooters. Overall, I recommend this game for those who want a team-work based, medium paced tactical shooter with okay graphics.",

I bought CSGO before this game and I wasn't big on CSGO after I bought it and I felt cheated out of a tactical game, when i bought this it was more than I expected and took me by surprise, I thought this game would be like battlefield, and in a sense it is, but more realistic, and honestly I think this is what Counterstrike should have been, this game has a similar concept and is 100 times better and requires more skill than a game without an aiming mechanic, and the game requires you to chat with your team to work together, I never felt more aligned with my own team than in this game, the importance of teamwork speaks out in this game big time and I think the only one that might be bigger once its out of alpha (as far as teamwork) would be Squad, but at the moment if you have extra money or just want a great game than don't hesitate to buy this game, its difficult to learn but extremely fun once you get the hang of it. 10/10 Best game of 2016-2142",

I got it in early access at $14.99 and thought it was a steal. It currently sells at $9.99 after adding content so you're basically ripping off the devs. Speaking of, New World Interactive has treated this game and it's community right. An actual success of early access, NWI continually updates bugs and adds content for free. They listen to their community as well as embrace the modding community. Day of Infamy being a perfect example as they created a stand alone for a mod of Insurgency. But we're here to talk about Insurgency...  Insurgency likes to be categorized as a tactical shooter in part to it's high damage models. I picked it up in early access because I kept hearing that, and that team work and communication is key. While team work and communication will guaruntee success, there is still room to have fun and run and gun, however, you have to be smart about it. This isn't Call of Duty, but I don't want to scare you away with the term 'tactical'. Over the years it has gained a wide enough audience that it's strayed from it's tight knit team work play style a little. If you work with your team though, you will fare a lot better. Especially if you want to move into the competitive/ranked side of the community.  It works on a class system which you have a certain amount of points to spend on weapons, attachments, accessories like grenades and armor. This limits certain weapons to certain classes, like snipers for marksmen classes, etc. The points limit you to make a choice of maxing out your weapon with attachments while skimping armor/grenades, or balancing them across equipment. Each piece also adds weight to your player which will affect your speed. All of this makes for balancing gunfights which are smooth and reliable. I personally love the gunplay in this game over your Counterstrikes, Battlefields, and Call of Dutys. It's as if I can feel the weapons through the mouse, if that makes any sense. Almost as if there's some weight behind each weapon.  For the $9.99 you get 24 maps, some are night versions, all with a variety of scenarios. There are some tight urban environments and also some more open, desert landscapes. The night maps add a completely different challenge. Also, if you don't want to play PvP multiplayer, they have a PvE coop mode against bots, and also a single player mode against bots. You really can't go wrong with this game at $9.99 and if you want to wait a little bit, I'm sure you can get it on sale for under $5. I've seen some reviews that say the graphics are bad, but for source engine, I think they look great. Of course they are a little dated due to the engine but it's a lot prettier than most games and they aren't super demanding for the lower tier PCs out there. Also, the sounds are good, but if you want to really feel like you're in the action, check out the workshop for some sound enhancing mods. You will feel as if you are in the game and ♥♥♥♥ your pants. This game makes me scared when I play it. I physically shake from adrenaline. Don't sleep on Insurgency.",

The glitches that were there when I first got it are not only still there in many frustrating cases, but new ones have been added since the newer updates. To be clear it is a fun game when it works well, but it doesn't do that often enough. Invisible explosions, explosives that don't explode, invisible fire and the list goes on.  Now that the developer is releasing sand storm it seems foolish to waste time on this source project. Here is hoping the next iteration of this game has improved technology because there really is no other game quite like it. It's full of great promise ruined by glitches, in particular because this is a game almost exclusively focused on multi-player. When the errors happen there, well mere words are insufficient.

This game is one of the only games that I will binge-play for hours on end because every single time a round ends, it is a new experience. This game is outstanding. It has a pretty good community, wide selection of guns and accessories, and like millions of maps, not to mention the ones on the workshop.    The workshop is one of the main reasons I like the game. The workshop offers endless amounts of fun because there are endless amounts of varieties. The workshop showcases gun skins, guns in general, sound packs, maps, you name it. It is great because it lets you play the game how you want.    Another thing about this game is the reality. the blood splatters, the fogginess when you get shot, the gun dynamics, the sounds and feels, Jesus, this is just the beginning. You can talk to teamates with command shortcuts that saw pretty much all that you need to say. There is also voicechat and regular chat. Just like any other game, you meet a lot of cool people. Oh, and one more thing: I absolutely love the lack of information that the game gives you. No killfeed, hitmarkers, sometimes even announcments. These make it realistic and creates a whole new experience.     This is just the beginning. I absolutely love the feel of this game (note my hours played). I am really exited that it will be upgraded to the Unreal Engine system. The graphics are getting out of date, but the overhaul should refresh it. I recommend this game 1,000 times over.

You can get this game for pretty cheap on sites like IndieGala. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes FPS, and is looking to go to the more tactical side without slowing the pacing to a snail crawl. plus you can use workshop content to make alot of thinks look better.  Pros: you can greatly change up your loadout from life to life. squard roles prevent there from being 15 snipers in the back of the map. realistic recoil, makes you learn to tap fire, and use burst mode. realistic bullet penetration, through walls and if you dont have armor. teaches you not to run out into combat and 360 no scope faze 420 blaze it AMAZING workshop content great level design (most of the time) have only in countered one possible hacker (or he is just really good). teaches you to work with your team, even if you dont have a mic. if there is someone killing you on the left side of the map everytime, it teaches you....you probably shouldnt go left next life. Also punishes you for dying (long spawn times, and limited amount of respawns), this is more for people who are looking to run &amp; gun. it teaches you to careful.  Cons: eo-tech and kobra sights are meh. i replaced them with ones from the workshop, it feels almost like cheating becuase they are so much better than the stock ones. low player count some weapons are just bad. (fal in my opinon) some maps can be one sided on certain points. IM LOOKING AT YOU B ON MARKET. (but it is always possible, you just need to work as a team)  Tips: He who shoots first, usually wins. or just get good at aiming.  akm, m16, sks, and m14 are all you need to know. avoid holding down the trigger if at all possible TAP FIRE IS YOUR BEST FRIEND you only need one burst with an m16 or two rounds with and akm to down your opponent with ap rounds. dont hug corners, you will lower your weapon, and watch for your barrel sticking out, it will give you away. unlike in BF4, DMR's are very useful, so dont be afraid to run with one.  and for very long distances, like the first point on sinjar, use single fire, to conserve ammo. for recoil, on m16 the heavy barrel is really all you need, but you will want to get the foregrip with the akm. you will need to make sacrifices if you want to be decent on the field. some times you will have to go without a sight, or sidearm, in exchange for body armour, or on a night map you may need nvg's which can cost you a grenade and sidearm. USE AP ROUNDS. they are worth every single point. hp rounds are also very good. tracer rounds are bad in general since they give you away. dont rage quit, some times you just need take a breath and move slower.

I grew tired of playing other shooters and recently jumped into this with a friend. As I jumped into a coop game with a friend, I'm wondering what took me so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ long and how stupid I felt that this game had been there waiting for me to put in meaningful time into it. Now I am hooked. This game requires patience, its not a game you jump into and just spray and pray and are instantly good at. The game is built on working together, not that its a requirement, but the flow of matches is a lot smoother with communication, pretty much like any other game. I guess there is a realism appeal here though, you do NOT have an ammo count, so you are forced to pay attention to the rounds youve dispensed. There is no health bar, and it does not regenerate, as a matter of fact, you die in at most 3 shots, as long as they are well placed at centermass at the very least. The hud is very minimal, which forces you to take in the environment and approach your angles cautiously. I ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ i n g love it. The graphics are great, the gameplay is amazing and smooth, the multiplayer is intense considering how cautious you have to be, which slows things down a bit but not in a bad way what so ever. The coop is amazingly fun especially with friends. There is definitely a sense of accomplishment when you and your crew jump in, take this objective, or blow this objective up, and just work together, watching over one another. I definitely reccommend this game over amd over, especially at the price it reaches during the Summer or Winter sale. Easily worth even the full priced value as well.",

Learning your role in the squad, how to perform it and the best gear to use. -Squad Training. Learning how to actually perform as a squad, keeping cover of teammates, covering flanks. -Clear Order. Learning to clear before everyone pushes up, to avoid flanks. Seems as though many play this as they would play a game like Call of Duty.

I liked the community as well, here in Insurgency you feel like you are playing a real military shooter with real squad leaders that give you orders and want you to push into the objective.

Playing coop mode with my brother and our mate, communication and coodination are key, and gives us an excellent experience of tactical play. We cover each others' advances, point out enemy locations, and coodinate to cover points of entry when facing a counter-attack. We move as one unit, and it feels excellent when we're successful.  There are no crosshairs, so you have to rely on your weapon sights, no ammo counter (only a counter for how many magazines you have left), and no big arrows pointing to where incoming fire is coming from. All of this adds to the enjoyment of the game, it forces you to be careful, to look for the enemy, and look out for your team mates. And when your gun goes 'click', you'll be glad you equipped that side arm; reloading a rifle takes a couple of seconds which could cost you your life.  Insurgency also gives you a great atmosphere. Being a Source engine game, yes, the graphics appear a little outdated, but once playing you don't really notice. Weapons make realist sounds and handle with more realism than other shooters. When bullets start landing around you, you hear the cracks as they strike and the dust they kick up can obscure your view, further adding to the atmosphere. When you're being suppressed by the enemy you really know about it, and if you don't keep your head down, one stray shot can take you out.   Equipment customisation is also good. There are a selection of various weapons for the different classes, with sevaral scopes, foregrips, laser or flashlight attachments, heavy barrels, and even different ammo types to choose from. Not to mention the ability to swap out your body armour, explosives, sidearms, etc. There is a points system in place and each piece of equipment costs, so you have to weigh up your options when choosing your equipment and find a combination that works for your play style.  This game delivers excellent cooperative, tactical team play, something I often crave from games these days. Not only that, it executes it well and provides a hell of a lot of fun in the process. We enjoy it so much we're planning to set up our own priate server!  The price is also good at only £5.99, though at the time of writing this it was currently on offer for £2.39 on the Humble Store, redeamable on Steam. You really can't turn your nose up at that!",

With the modes in the game, all of them revolve around taking and holding points for reinforcements. That, or destroying/taking an objective. You will almost always be able to find games in every category, but some are definitely played more than others. With that said, I feel there needs to be more depth of some sort, because what the game really comes down to is killing, getting killed and taking points, that's every mode in every game. Maybe have moving objectives or mobile ones even; or perhaps an industrial or mansion type environment that represents one large objective that needs to be cleared. Overall, Insurgency needs more varience in game modes. As far as repetition goes, it starts to wear out. With the games 'realism', you will be dying a lot, and on some maps, particularly the large and open ones, you'll be dying consecutively for sometimes the entire match; yes even with decent teamplay.

Insurgency is like the Counter Strike you've always wanted. It doesn't have a high skill ceiling, all the weapons and classes are equally balanced yet drastically different, the maps feel like actual locations stuck in the middle of military conflict and not like they were designed to be multiplayer maps specifically. The weapons in this game feel amazing. From the way they shoot to the way they sway at your hip, they actually feel like they have weight to them. Player movement is also pretty decent for a game useing the source engine. Your soldier's speed and locomotion is determined based on how much equipment you're carrying, and that plays a huge role in how agile you are. Now if you've played CoD or Battlefield and are used to the whole 'run-and-gun' aspect of those games, I have to warn you now to completely forget that and to start playing more tactfully. Insurgency is hard, but very fair. You need to play smart while still being forceful. You cannot lone-wolf in this game or else you'll lose and get kicked by your teammates. The community for Insurgency is pretty friendly to new and old players alike. I really can't recommend this game enough..",

Insurgency is just one of those games that almost everyone will enjoy.  f Pros: Gunplay is Unquie and diffrent too many first person shooters Weapon modding system is very important having to think about what to spend points on Classes, yeah you heard right, In this game you can play diffrent roles such as rifleman, sniper, recon and more not only does this decide what play style you will use in the match but it gives you class specfic weapons. Squads have limits for class selection ie. only one person can be a sniper while to can be a rifleman ect. This is great because in some FPS games it can really ♥♥♥♥ me off when everone uses the same gun. The graphics are quite good Sound effects are very realistic gunplay has no crosshair making it feel realistic  Lots of choice for things such as scopes, ammo, grenade and things such as foregrips and flashlights. Tons of different game modes some being PVP while others are Co-op Community is very nice unlike some others that you find in games like rust and Counter strike full modding support for people to make maps and weapons AI in this game aren't stupid and can acctuly put a bullet in your head Cons very few servers in the AUS and some others some people like to troll by running around doing nothing sometimes very few people are online. can put you in a rage induced coma when you keep dying on spawn  To put it simply just get this game!  9.5/10- Will Rage Again",

Whenever someone asks me what Insurgency is about, I always say 'Imagine being dropped straight into Afghanistan'. This game hates you, but that's why it's so easy to love.  Now, like I said, I have almost no PvP multiplayer experience. I think My KDR in PvP is something like 5/40? But still, the bots are no pushovers, either. They have a lot of dumb moments, yes. Many times, a bit will slide into the middle of a room looking at the ceiling. Other times, though, they will shoot you in the head if you aren't quick enough. I remember once my whole team was heading through an archway when all the sudden, one of our characters says 'OH SH** RPG!'. We all died. It killed every single one of us.
