            "review_text": " Note: Reposted my review for the Steam rewards although I haven't changed anything in it.   Cafe 0 is the second game that came out by the developer roseVeRte and it's a visual novel that has elements of the supernatural and horror. You take on the role of Marin Umino who has just died and finds herself in an unusual-looking cafe. A waiter named Sui approaches her and offers her the chance to relive the last 7 days of her life.   So that's basically, the premise of the story. It's pretty short if you plan on playing through the game only once but since I like replaying games to learn the entire story, I found myself interested in understanding what happened to Marin that led to her death. To understand the true story, it's necessary to play through most of the good and bad paths to get the necessary items needed for it. Although I'm not usually a fan of anything that has a horror theme for personal reasons, I do like this developer's games so I wanted to give Cafe 0 a chance. Overall, I liked it and the story drew me in. ^^  The art is similar to the developer's first game dUpLicity~Beyond the Lies~ so there may be mixed reviews on that aspect. The music was decent and it fit in well with certain events that happened in the story and all. Overall, I would say that if you like this developer's games, then you'll most likely like Cafe 0. However, I do think that the East Tower series is better, as I played that series before I touched Cafe 0. (I have yet to play How to Take Off Your Mask as I'm posting this review so I can't comment on it yet.)",

This visual novel takes you through 7 days with the main character. This game can give you a lot of conflicting emotions and is generally ok but not worth the full price as it is quite short.",

            "review_text": "TL;DR: If you're in the mood for a mysterious story that's not necessarily happy and you can handle a mostly unpleasant main character, this is a good read. Don't go into it expecting a 'reverse harem' where you experience wonderful, heady romance with each of the guys, and you should do fine.  ---   Overall Impression : Because of the fact that it's an early work, the graphics aren't all that amazing and the writing can be a little weak in some areas... That said, after completing the story, I really enjoyed it and hope more people give it a chance.   Content : There are no visuals or text that are above about maybe PG, or at most, PG-13 levels. If you don't mind mild spoilers, I will say that the relationship between the MC and the Doctor does appear to be inappropriate, but there's nothing that a mature child would feel guilty for reading. That doesn't mean that it doesn't get disturbing. It is a mystery surrounding a death, after all.   Translation : There are occassionally parts that seem a little awkward, but there isn't anything that's really confusing (that's not meant to be confusing, that is).    Editing : I didn't notice anything that needed corrections!    Art : As you can see, it's not super flashy. It doesn't need to be, though. It's not the sort of game that 'needs' flashy art and some of the CGs are actually really nice.   Character Design : It does its job! This isn't the sort of game that really demands anything that 'stands out' in that sense. Having said that, once having completed the game, I came to appreciate the way the Heroine's various looks worked.   Story : It was a heck of a lot more twisted than I expected it to be. In a way, it was a lot more satisfying than I anticipated.   I find myself not really wanting to say much here, because I feel as if every stage of my response to the game's story and the characters in it helped me appreciate it as a whole. I will say that I didn't enjoy it at first, but perservered simply because it was short. The more routes I completed and the more I understood the story, and the more interested I became in it. By the end, while I don't see myself returning to the game to read it again anytime soon (someday, I'm sure), I absolutely can recommend it if it's a type of story you'd be interested in.   The Heroine : I really disliked her at first. It took several play-throughs for me to develop some sympathy for her, but the more I played, the less I disliked her. The more I knew about her situation, the more I could understand how she came to be the way she is. As such, if you want a character who has a real personality - she certainly does!    In closing ... Give it a go. I was able to 100% the game in only a couple of hours (even having left it open on the title screen for a bit to grab a snack, only to come back to Sui, the blue-haired boy, chewing me out for wasting his time). I don't think The Drowned Mermaid is what you're probably expecting. I hope you try it and agree with me that it's actually better. I hope to return to Cafe 0 for another story one day.",
