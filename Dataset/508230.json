            "review_text": "First impressions of the game: So I just completed my first run of the game, I love the idea of the game, from what I have seen there are only 3 different genres to choose from 'Harem Anime, Mystery Anime, and Action Anime'.  The game starts off as a Visual Novel for about 20 or so minutes (depending on how fast you read) and then is a mix of VN and choices which affect how your anime will be going. Now of course I failed, at the start I made good choices but as time went on, not so many good choices. I enjoyed the dialog and thought it was interesting and good, I had a laugh or two here and there.   Just a heads up, there is no audio of any sorts if you are expecting it, I thought there would be but then after checking back here I realised there was no voice acting in this game/ VN. It doesn't seem that there is much of a variety with genre choices as well, which absoutly sucks in my opinion, I hope they change this at some point in a update, to make the game have more of a variety in content. This is because 3 different genres probably would get boring pretty fast even with 6 different endings.   Gameplay: 7/10 Music: 7/10 Visuals: 9/10 Dialog: 7/10  In short, if you are looking for something fun, and that will kill sometime, I would recommend taking a look at this game, however it may not be for everyone as it still lacks in a fair few elements. The art is absolutly fantastic and looks so well done, I'm sure the developers spent a lot of time creating the art for this. The music was fantastic (when it did come on).",

            "review_text": "Well, I managed to finish the game even though I didn't get a good ending. Still, the game itself is good! Nice animations/arts even though there weren't any voice acts but still it's alright. Like the story too, pretty refreshing for a VN (suprisingly it didn't bore me like some other VNs do) so I do recommend this game! The price is worth it (y) ^_^",
