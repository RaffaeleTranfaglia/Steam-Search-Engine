For those older gamers if you remember the game called 'JezzBall', well this is the improved version of that one :) Its 1$ at the moment and its more than worth it!",

I particulary enjoyed a couple of achievements that required some thought and skill (finishing a level without using cannons and finishing a leven in less than 10 captures), I think a few more of this challenges would be nice, maybe as challenges included in the game and not only as achievements. It's easy to understand and fun to play, recommended for anyone looking for some uncomplicated entertainment (it also includes classic levels, from Fortix 1, I assume).",

Actually includes some improvements such as extra monsters, extra power-ups, and the option to replay a certain level in a stage as opposed to having to start all over if you die mid-way or at the final level (was very frustrating in Fortix 1). My only complaint is this: why the kiddy look in the sequel???? It almost looks as if they're imitating other kiddy-looking games such as Angry Birds and Candy Crush. It's a very drastic change from the original game, which had more of a medieval look to it. A very odd change in tone.  Aside from that, this game is excellent and the price is a steal.",

The thing that keeps me playing this game is getting those darn 3 stars to match for every level.   Gameplay: Use WASD or Arrow Keys to move around. Capture Land by connecting lines Repeat until you get 3 stars on every level!  Nice change of pace from my shooters and RTS games.",
