It's also my favorite Sakura game. I enjoyed the story, and I can't wait for the next chapter~",

I have to say that is has more of a plot compared to the others, you'll also get to make a lot of choices now which is good thing. Really starting to enjoy it now especially since the plot is much bigger this time than just bewbs and the soundtrack is also very well done. Though my favorite in the series is still Sakura Spirit, mainly for nostalgic purposes and the charming characters. This series might actually be as good as it or maybe even better. It's a little weird how they actually reused some of the character models from Sakura Angels but they made quite a few adjustments so that you will be able to think of them as entirely new characters. Definitely recommend this if you are a big fan of the franchise as I am :) I'm currently waiting for Chpater 2 to be released which should be sometime in July as announced by Winged Cloud. There are also rumors that the next 2 games will be called Sakura Dungeon and Sakura Beach. So there is a lot to look forward to this year from Winged Cloud.",

            "review_text": "I will say this upfront. I am not very well-versed when it comes to visual novels. Not particularly a fan of them, either. Largely because I generally don't consider them to be games. Look at Skyrim, Devil May Cry, or Metal Gear Solid. All of those are games. Because you take active role in what happens in those games. Visual novels, on the other hand, are products where you generally read a wall of text with characters on screen making facial expressions to match their emotions. I prefer my games where I do something other than just sit and read. If I wanted to read, I would read a book. But that's a different topic. Right now, I am going to review Sakura Fantasy Chapter 1.  Sakura Fantasy is a game that draws you in with the promise of anime girls in various states of undress and sexuality. And for the first few hours, it seems to be just that. Our protagonist heroine, Raelin, is a knight-to-be, born with the ability of far-seeing that allows her to seeing into places that is not in her line of sight hence the name. Which everyone assumes she uses to spy on other people in their private moments. And despite her denial when asked directly, she actually does.   But is it truly a boob/yuri-fest and nothing more? It is true that those exist. But it's not all that this novel is about. It delivers a compelling story with an interesting setting. If you can look past the nudity, and are able to ignore that 'itchy' feeling you get inbetween your legs.  I don't like being that person but... If you are a fan of anime, like anime girls and/or possess an artistic appreciation for the female body, there is a good chance you will like this game. If you don't like the female physique being treated as a mere object, dislike anime or nudity in any form of media, it's more than likely that you will hate this 'game'. This is a 'game' targeted for open-minded individuals who have no qualms about nudity in their stories/games.",

            "review_text": "This Sakura game has the best story out of all the Sakura games I've played so far. Hands down. I think the fact that this is the first game in a longer series made the story much better. The first half of this game is all about introducing us to the characters, getting to known them and their backstories a bit, and just getting a general feel for the setting. The second half is where things get actiony and they tease ever so slightly at what is to come in later installments. The writing in this is so much better than previous games it's astounding. This might be my favorite Sakura game so far, either this or Swim Club cause that one is super great too. The art is perfect as always, Wanaca never disappoints. I'm excited for Chapter 2 and hope the wait for it won't be too long.  I also really liked that the MC is female for a change. It gives the game a much different feel than the other Sakura games. The MC also has a fun little power that lets her basically project her mind and become the best peeping tom ever. Hilarity follows.  Update: Winged Cloud just released an uncensored patch like the one for Swim Club.",

It has maybe too much fan service, which sometimes ruin the moment, yet it kind of intensifies the bond between those characters. The story itself will probably really start in chapter 2, since this is kind of foreplay. :P  Still can´t wait for another part :3 Overall rating for me would be 8,5/10",

I mean ya get this big text box and u only get 1/15th of the box filled with text! Urgh thats gunna give me so many eye problems. Anyway, when this novel wants to deliver atmosphere it does so pretty well, there is a certain character that gives off an air all her own, you'll know who this being of mystique is when you meet her and you'll see what I mean. I personally cannot WAIT for this to be finished, all the chapters and all! at times there are TRUE multiple choice paths, but overall either choice just gives the SET path a different coating. The points of TRUE multiple choice are completly worth the effort to go back to and see. A good little read, (if annoyingly laid out). oh and I forgot to mention, for those who KNOW The sakura series of visual novels will know that this stuff is fairly echi. well it takes the echi of the past and cranks it up to 11 here! Its more bold than Ive ever seen from a sakura novel! And the sad moments of the story, Oh man do they hit hard, THE FEELS MAN! I have to admit the fact you SEE your character you are and that its female threw me for a loop, I spent the first 3 minutes thinking: 'who is this person on my screen hanging around like that?' Wasnt prepared for that. Nice surprise.",
