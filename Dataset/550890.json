    "description": "Repulsanoid is a unique but simple 3D Puzzle game, that features a one-of-a-kind control method and provides a wide variety of challenges based around it. It tasks the player with controlling the bounds of the stage, rather than a character. It's a stress-free, but engaging test of your reflexes and 3D thinking.",
