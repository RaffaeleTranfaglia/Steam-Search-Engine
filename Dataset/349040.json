            "review_text": "Important info before doing my review.  CPU: i5 3670k ( 3.40GHz ) GPU: GTX 670  I have not played the story mode yet. Just been doing online, and versus.  --- I normally don't do reviews, and I doubt my review will even be seen, but with the game getting bashed so hard. I wanted to give my opinion. I had the game preordered, and saw the reviews were terrible, I was scared the game was going to be bad, and run badly. So I started up the game. And so far my experience with the game has been quite nice. I haven't had any of the issues others have had really. Maybe I'm just lucky.  There are some small problems with this game like audio, and the fact that we have to go through the config files to actually change some options. But they can easily be (and hopefully are) patched. And even with the small problems, I don't think it deserves to get slammed like it is now.  From what I have seen a lot of people having problems with the game don't even meet the min requirements for GPU and/or CPU. There are exceptions of course of people with great cpus, and GPUs like 970s+ having problems.(Maybe is somehow more optimized for older GPUs? Idk). But again from what I have seen on the discussions page, a lot of the people complaining don't meet the requirements for this game at all. I think people just assumed because they could run Naruto UNS3, they could run this game as well or something.   In closing, the game isn't a bad port at all, BUT at the same time, it isn't a very good port either. It's pretty average, but the fanbase is making it seem like it's Batman AK.  If you actually meet the requirements of this game and want the game, buy it, you should be fine, and if not somehow, well at least steam refunds is a thing.   P.S. I've also played this on my friend's computer with a gtx 960, and it ran fine as well.",

            "review_text": "Alright i dont usually take time to write reviews but i will since i was very hyped for this game and I am a big Naruto fan.  Pros: So let's be clear, the game itself is amazing, very well done story mode, even including bonus story. Tons of characters which is always what we all want from a fighting game. Graphics are great. You most likely will need skills to play online multiplayer (Competitive or not). Community is fantastic and very nice. Gameplay leaves incredible battles like you have never seen before from a fighting game. Every game you play as something new to offer. Every characters can be played in different ways which makes it almost impossible to actually say: I played all character and seen all ultimates/awakening and now its boring.  Cons: Very bad optimized for computer. 30 fps lock. Multiplayer servers from high distance countries will most likely be unplayable (US vs France by exemple). You cannot mute players you are fighting against (which can turn out extremely annoying in certain situations).   Finally, the game is amazing, there are way more pros than cons, and the bad reviews given to the game are almost only related to the 30 fps lock/bad optimization.   You should definitly buy this game if you are a Naruto fan or a fighting genre player.",

Pros:  -The graphics are amazing, CC has done an amazing job giving the series a good transition to 3d while maintaining the art style. -The fights are flashy and fun -Story mode (while uncecessarily lengthy at times) has some of the coolest boss fights in this game, I usually ♥♥♥♥ on 'cinematic events' and 'QTEs' but NUNS4's are really entertaining to watch (play?) -Lots of new costumes and movesets for pretty much every character -Character roster is huge -New mechanics effectively combine the old team mechanics from the previous games (which were screwed up in the last game, im very glad the team building aspect is back, instead of just 'pick a playstyle') -you can plug in two controllers and play with your friends, which has always been a feature but a lot of other games dont do it, i also mention it because the online play is garbage  Cons: -Adventure mode is boring -Online battles are awful, half second input lag, the winner is the one who cheeses the hardest. Pretty much every NUNS game is guilty of this -Not enough ability cap survivals in free battle survival mode -aside from the Sound 4 character pack, the DLC is pretty awful and overpriced -2 characters are locked behind pre-order  Overall: Game is great, Cyber Connect does it again. Pretty much all of the real gripes i have about this game have more to do with Bamco and their business decisions. I don't even like the Naruto series but i do like me some fast ninja fightan. Get this when it's on sale, unless you really feel like giving Bamco 70 american dollarydoos for the base game and season pass.",

I can now play the game and all it's amazing graphics, battles, costumes, story, etc...   The fact that I can switch my team members in and out during battle is pretty cool. It helps mix up the techniques and combinations. Not to mention, in free battle, you can play multiple rounds in one battle now.   Seriously, this is an amazing game. I hope everyone else will be able to get the game to work on there computer. Once they do, I hope they will enjoy the game in all it's glory.   8/10",

The Fourth Shinobi World War is very important to the game and anime adaptation as well as the Sasuke VS Naruto fight which is the big climax of the game and anime.    Gameplay:     The gameplay is very smooth and its better then then it was in the last game. With the new tag-team feature it sure is more fun to play also, the Team Ultimate Jutsus are great they add more thrill to the gameplay.    Character Roster:    They have added a few new versions of characters (Sasuke Rinne Sharingan, Minato Reanimation and etc) and DLC like costumes for The Last characters.    Multiplayer:    I haven't played the multiplayer too much. I only played with a friend and we had fun playing against each other.    Conclusion:     The game is great, since it is the last Storm game you should definitely buy it.",

There are major UI Stutter with the start screen and menus. Also the fact that it take six decades to switch menus. Online needs to be fixed the UI there is so bad its not even funny. 30fps i can deal with cause its a button masher not a serious fighting game in my opinion but disappointing not to have 60fps. The Ultimate Justus run fine when there in animation but the avatars your playing when they say there justus or make expressions slows the game for what ever reason in what ever quality low or high tried it. Online with friends need to be fixed when you get an invite it takes you back to the start screen then the online to wait even more to go the the online lobby to wait even more jesus even with excellent internet connection. Just wait for the fix if they fix it or dont buy.",

It's not even the fact that the game isn't 60fps, honestly it's not that big a deal. But no vsync, bad preformance, frame rate drops mid combat, menu slow down, etc. Like why? There is literally no excuse for this. Oh yeah, there are only two resolution settings, 1080p and 720p. For me this isnt a big deal since i have a 1080p monitor, but if you have a higher res monitor or something like that you wont be happy with these 2 options. I havent even touched the story in this game yet, and I might not since I'm highly considering returning this pile of garbage. So if you were thinking about getting it, either don't get it, get it on console, or wait until they patch it (if they ever do).",

Didn't realize this was an early access title.   2/10    So I tried playing this game on not one, but 3 different rigs.  Controller - Steam Controller using Xinput  First rig, 'The Beheamoth'-  i7 4770k OC'd @ 4.5 Ghz Nvidia GTX 970 3.5GB Windows 10 16 GB ram  Performance results -  30 FPS solid, with a LOT of stutter, almost unplayable. Menus are slow and unresponsive some of the times. Crashes to desktop around every 20 minutes of gameplay, or right after a cutscene just before a fight.  Second rig, 'The Monster' -  i7 2600k @ 3.5 Ghz Nvidia 770 2GB Windows 7 8 GB ram  performance results-  30 fps, occasional dip to 25, not as noticable stutter as before but still there. Menu's are decently responsive, no crashes with 30 minutes of gameplay. Always launches into windowed mode, so always have to manually toggle fullscreen. Probably the most 'playable' of the three.  Third rig, 'The Little Engine That Could' -  i7 2600k @3.5 Ghz Amd HD 7870 Windows 7 8 GB ram  performance results-  20 FPS with occasional ups to 30, stutters whenever any jutsu or any over the top effect is going on screen. Heavy input lag on menus, about 2 second delay for buttons to be pressed. Crashes everytime after finishing Hashirama/Madara fight. Least playable.   With all that said, it baffles me that my top rig can't seem to handle it as well as my second, and it even baffles me more how varied performance is. It's almost like RNG.  Keep in mind I did force V-sync for every rig.  Bottom line is, this game is a mess no matter which way you cut it. If the game is runs alright for you and up to your standards, thats great but the fact remains more people than not are having issues, even those with actual gaming rigs and not terrible HP laptops.   Hopefully CC2 can at least correct some of these issues. Honestly, 30 fps doesn't bother me as much as the menu lag, the crashes, and the stutters. If the engine isn't physics dependant, hopefully a 60 FPS mod can be in the works for when this game can actually run on a Nasa super computer.",

            "review_text": "I am not going to lie. I am very upset with how this game turned out. The ninja storm story has always been the main seeling point of the game. The combat has always been mediocre at best, and is pretty bland. The story however was exciting and fun. However; it brings me to much shame to say that the story in ninja storm 4 is just terrible. Most of the funny and interesting cutscenes were removed and replaced with still images from the anime with a voice over, which is just god awful. The story was rushed, missing almost half of the content from the manga and the anime, and just about every major and epic thing from the kaguya arc was squeezed into two battles. The final battles with madara and kaguya take up just one small chapter and they have left out a lot of things that were important to the series. An example of one is narutos most powerful attack, the 9 tailed beast rassengan barrage that he uses on kaguya. It was scraped from the game completely. There are also a few mechanical issues with the game. One of the ones i noticed most was the audio issue with the story mode. Sometimes there are massive frame rate drops but that isnt very common and you wont always notice it.   So now that thats out of the way, heres a pro and con list for you guys who like it simple.  Pro list: &gt; great combat (best in the series &gt; many characters &gt; cool attacks &gt; a few really cool boss battles &gt; adventure mode for added game time after story is done &gt; online works well &gt; final battle is really well done and almost makes up for all the flaws from the story mode (almost) &gt; lots of collectables and items to unlock  Con list: &gt; story mode was nerfed &gt; audio issues with story &gt; still images with voice overs replace cutscenes &gt; kaguya arc was nerfed and misses most of the epic moments &gt; a few really forced, boring and awful boss battles &gt; AI is a nightmare in story mode &gt; massive frame rate drop in certain parts of the game &gt; story mode is short (took me 5 hours after skipping a few cutscenes. as opposed to the 10+ hours from the previous games)  All and all, its a fun game for a few hours. Because of the story mode being how it is i cant recommend the game if you are playing for that reason. If you want a game you can play with some friends then go for it, but wait for a sale",

But this PC port, on it's current, state is just disappointing in too many levels, and not just because of the 30 FPS lock. The game honestly is pretty smooth even with the 30 FPS lock. The major issues for me are:  - Subpar cutscenes on story mode, that are all pre rendered with a really low quality, which make them even worse than a HD version of the anime (much worse than Full Burst 3) - Audio issues that make the sound of the voices only reproduce on the left speaker (no fix so far) - Lack of graphics options on the menu compared to previous games, which is just inexcusable  I suppose removing the 30 FPS lock would have been nice too.",

Positives:  * This game is quite fun * The story mode is epic and I haven't gone through four story missions yet (free battle is too hard for me to quit)  * The new characters Boruto and Sarada are addictive to play especially together as intended * The characters in this have been quite buffed and elemental environment effects add many volumes to the game for tactics  Negatives: * The settings are meh, it doesn't give too many options to fiddle with",

They have promised us, the players that pre ordered the game, Boruto and Sarada as exclusive characters to us.  I, of course, pre ordered for this reason. The exclusive characters were the only reason for me to pre order this game and not wait til its on a discount.   I understand they want to release a DLC story based on their latest movie, but they need to do something about us, whom pre ordered for the characters.   We were promised Boruto and Sarada as 'exclusive to pre-order and won’t be sold later on' (quote from their official site, add me if you want the link) only for them to sell them later on.   Also, to the players saying they will be with a different moveset, their official twitter thinks otherwise. A fellow Naruto fan has asked them about the people purchasing the DLC if they will get Boruto and Sarada with their same move set as the pre order only to get an official yes answer from them. (You can also add me to the tweet link)   I am going to speak on behalf of the players who pre ordered the game for you, CyberConnect2 to provide us with the DLC for free to those who pre ordered the game in exchange for our lost pre order exclusives. If you provide the DLC to the people who pre order, the DLC will still be on sale for those who didn't pre order, and those who did can be appeased.   There shouldn't be any problems with CyberConnect2 selling the DLC to season pass holders since it specifically states 'Get access to the three NARUTO SHIPPUDEN: Ultimate Ninja STORM 4 add-on packs at a discounted price' meaning they can still earn money from the DLC, and only lose a a fraction of their sales to the people who pre ordered.   Honestly, I, and probably some other people would never had pre ordered this game for a Hokage Kakashi Costume only. I would've waited to pay 16.99 USD for this game if it was only for a costume. I am sad having to put a negative review over a great game just because of DLC problems that isn't even released yet. I felt like I had to express my disappointment with the developers avoiding the questions from the pre orderers.   I hope that we can get an official word on this since we paid full price for something that'll be released for paid later.",

The battles itself, I've had no issues with screen tearing (which I had to manually turn on via the Nvidia control panel) but the still-shot cutscenes I was having HUGE screen tear and the menus are attrocious. Its just slow and unresponsive, sorting through menus is a chore and just bogs down the experience of a game I've been looking forward to for a looooooooong time. I pre-ordered the game and for whatever reason my controller wont let me pick the kakashi 6th hokage costume. Its not an intregal part of why I pre-ordered it, but I did so I would like to use it.   Im about 60% through the story and I'm loving it. Characters' design and moves are amazing as always but the game is just not up to par technically. Im getting this on PS4 as well, so I can play with my brother, so I'm not too upset but hopefully patches come through to make this the optimal experience of this game.

Anything beyond that or even lower you're going to have to go into to the config file to change. I have a gtx 980 and was able to get the game to play on 5120x2160 but the finish scenes you get during your ultimate jutsu finish scale terribly and the black overlay effect glitches out. I also have a pc with a gtx 660 superclocked and it lags immensly during the menu screens but will play fine during a match, anytime text pops up on the screen such as when you win a round the game while just start lagging. My major gripe though is the sound in story mode is just terrible. Playing with headphones on and all the voice acting plays through only the left ear while the effects and music work just fine. The voices are fine during battle but when it goes to a cutscene all of a sudden it'll just play in my left ear. I wish I could recommend this game but with all the problems it has I just can't.

PROs:  - The graphics - the new particle effects and models look absolutely gorgeous, way better than anything previous game have come up with. - Leader swapping - This is what should have been implemented in the Storm games a long time ago. - The story mode. - Armor destruction and element effects. - Online doesn't have the issues it had in previous installments. - A pretty big chunk of content.  CONs:  - 30 fps. Seriously, devs, this is a 2016 PC game. This has absolutely no excuse. The good thing is that the game is fluent enough that it doesn't feel like other 30 fps games. - Graphical issues for some AMD cards and stuff, will be fixed by patches and stuff. - The removal of support characters instead of fleshing them out as playable. This is the last Storm game and we still don't have Kurenai and Anko as playable characters - what the hell? - Toxic online community. Expect ragequits, spamming Deidara+Tobi combos and angry russians shouting at you in Russian.  Also, the initial bad reviews this game has were due to people trying to play it on their integrated graphics cards and GT 620s and also due to the legitimate optimization issues it had on some goods cards.

And please, stop using the 'it's connection based matches so it happens because of your connection', because honestly i just don't care. If i can play and enjoy other online game without any connection problems then i expecto it to be the same for the game i payed 70$ for, even if it means the publisher will need to buy servers to host the online matches on.  The second problem is not as important, and it is the fact that you cant change the FPS and that there's no option for more gory animation, it would have been better with some blood, i have to say.    ill change the review if atleast the online matches problem will be solved.",

Every naruto game even the consoles are 30fps, and who cares about the frame drop? I'm sure everyone gets the frame drop every so often, and I see a complaint on crashes also, luckily, I have a fix for you windows 10 users, just find the application in your programs x86, find steam, open it and find steamapps, go to common and go to naruto storm 4, right click the program to launch the game and go to properties, go to compatibility and change the compatibility to windows 7, I think this only fixes the crash for windows 10 users, but it might help the others also, and if you have NVIDIA, go to the control panel and go to manage 3D settings, now I don't know if you guys have it but in global settings, it says like preferred graphics processer, I don't have it but if you DO have it, change it to High Performance GPU, and also in the drop down table in global settings, find vertical sync and turn it on, this will work for Nvidia users only, but how I fixed my crashes was to only change the compatibility to windows 7. and if you have the minimum requirements for the game, guys, don't assume that you're going to run at the best performance, that just means that the game is playable for you. Hope this helps.  UPDATE: About 9 hours I made this review, I found out how to fix the sound, go to your playback devices and find your main speaker and then in the advanced tab, go change it to 48000.",

It's problems start with the opimization which it has: NONE OF I entered into the game and as I got to the title screen the lag was terrible  I felt like I was moving through sticky tar when trying to even play it.  Another issue that people have also complained about is there is really no keyboard options built into the game Now I could care less about keyboard controls for a fighting game, but if your going to put a game on PC you need decent keyboard controls.  Other issues include: Pay Wall DLC to get to future characters No clear instructions on how to use newer controls and what they do. CHANGING CHARACTERS FOR EXAMPLE 30fps locked in. And other technical dificulties that I can't explain due to my lack of knowledge in the field of computers / computer gaming.  Side note: I've heard the console versions ended up being just as bad.

At this point in time my computer is only just slightly better than a toaster oven, but the game runs well enough for me not to tear it apart at every given moment, and that's at lowest settings without config edits. Is the game flawless? Hell no, it's in a shaky start. Does it deserve such terrible reviews, I honestly don't think so, this is no Arkham Knight. I don't know my exact specs, but my hardware is a few years old now, so it's not anywhere near top of the line. I'd give it a 7/10 in it's current state. I'll start with the Cons, to get the bad out of the way first.  Cons: -30 FPS Lock, despite being said that this game would be optimized well on the PC. -Slightly lower frames on menu screens. I go down 19 frames at most, usually it's around 24-27. Battles run pretty smooth. -No option to turn off mics in online play. Seriously, why? I know how to do it, sure, but I want to be able to fight someone without hearing a tornado rip their homes apart. -Slide show cutscenes in story mode. Seriously, this was a terrible desicion. -Low framerate when awakening. Usually affects Susano'o characters. -Crap keyboard support, as always. Doesn't overly matter to me since I have an Xbox controller to use, but still that should be better looked at.  I haven't experianced some of the other issues mentioned, so I can't comment on those.  Pros: -Great story. Seriously it was nice to finally watch Naruto come to an end rather than the dub being 30 years behind and the sub being to caught up in the infinite filler to complete the story. (FYI I did read the manga, notice how I said 'watch') Loved how they handled the final battle. -Animated cutscenes were great. Seriously if we had this quality of cutscenes during Obito's backstory, or when the mask fell off it would have been amazing. They all looked so well done, it's a shame a good portion was just a slideshow. -Better English dub acting. By far one of the highest points for me. In previous games several of the characters didn't show enough emotion in their lines. It's especially noticeable on Naruto when he shouts. This is the first time since Storm 2 that English Naruto's Rasengan actually sounds intimidating. This wasn't his actress's fault, but the people who handed her the script and told her to read it, and those who put weak sounding voices in the game rather than rerecording new ones. -Overall smooth gameplay. Minus awakening, menus, and not being 60 FPS the gameplay is pretty smooth, and that's really what needs to be done right in the end, as that's what makes the game actually playable, you know? -WORKING Online play. Last time I bought a Storm game (Full Burst) I regretted it immediately because the online was broken and by the time they fixed it they'd already begun hyping up Revolution. I can actually play the game with friends, rather than being disconnected partway through every match. -Adventure Mode is pretty good, a bit bland, but about what you'd expect from an Adventure mode.   Is this game perfect? Hell no. However it's definitely better off than Full Burst was. If they fix up the issues that can be fixed with it I'd easily give it an 8.5/10, maybe even 9/10, but as it stands now, it's at a very shaky 7/10. I have a few more personal things, but overall they're not worth mentioning. I'd still recommend it to fans of the series, as everything seems fine on my end. Here's hoping they fix the issues others are having swiftly so we can all enjoy it.",

I'm glad they did away with choosing between having Ult, Awakening, and Sealing from Revolution. Having everything all together plus the new linked secret techniques is very nice compared to Revolutions system of just picking the teams that link up and your ult is changed to their combo. This way you don't see it often but, when you do it is spectacular.  I haven't gotten that far into the game yet but, all the modes I have played are enjoyable. Especially the main combat, they kept everything that was good with Revolutions system and added on to it. Now as for the horde battles, it could do with some better camera mechanics or at the very least a lock on system. Other than this, the rail running system they have is fun and the giant battles are impressively done if a little slow but, it's giant monsters/susanoos/etc. so what can you expect.  Now on to technical issues with the game.  - As others stated it is locked at 30fps. (Which isn't a bad thing at all.) - As it is, a new release, there are bound to be problems. - The only issue I have run into that I could not fix was that some voice audio, from the story cutscenes from what I've seen, would only play through the left speaker.  Which honestly wasn't a problem to me. Other than that it works and plays like a charm.  I run a very high-end system though so for those that have the option, try playing it on console if your afraid your computer can't run it.",

As for the game itself, as little as I've played so far anyways, is great. It takes everything from the past Ninja Storm games and improves upon it in almost every way.

I was a little afraid to buy the PC version, Because of everything I heard, But it was so worth it! The final game, Translating the anime, into gameplay! Its a fast, fighting game, with TONS of variety! (Over 100 characters!) Its crazy to imagine all the work put into modeling, animating, and voice acting for this! Its a fun game, Theres an endless amount of things you can do! Online battle, Free battle (personal favorite, play with friends AND MURDER THEM!) Adventure mode, etc! :) reccomended! :D",

If you're a Naruto fan like me and love the anime and want to see the end of the amazing saga summerized in english dub by all means buy this game. If you're here interested in playing this game competitively that would be a terrible idea. The online competitive mode lags you out 90% of the time even if you do have a stable connection. You are most likely going to have a one sided match with some weebu out there still jerking off to anime porn, who hasn't put the game down unless he needs to ♥♥♥♥, eat or jerkoff to more hentai. Now for those like me that want a good ending to their favorite anime go right ahead and buy this game. You may struggle getting the game to run smoothly so tinker at it a little and read the forums if you have no idea what to do. The game itself is fun and true to the manga for the most part. The charecter roster is pretty damn solid if you never played any of the other Ninja Storm games you will be impressed.  As for dlc don't expect much its just clothes and different finisher moves besides the sound 4 expansion. Now if I could only buy one dlc I would save it for the big one coming up known as the Boruto Expansion.",

During my playthrough of the game there were a couple frame drops mostly when there was a lot happening on the screen, which has been the case for almost all Storm games. So this is nothing new, and I was expecting this to be the case regardless of it being a 'next gen title.' In addition, many reviews are reviewing the game on performance alone with little to no playtime. This Storm game itteration was made to be more graphically intensive, which it is. So people expecting to jump from being able to run the earlier games to this one might be met with an un-welcome surprise.  However, I don't even have a high end PC and I am able to run the game perfectly fine. So people claiming that the game is not running on an up to date graphics card and processor, I find it very hard to believe. I am by no means saying the game couldn't use some optimization. It can, but I also think people need to understand that the minimum requirements might not be good enough for this game.  If you are still sceptical about purchasing the game because of mixed reviews, I will almost gurantee the negative reviews will be flushed out by those who have finsihed the game, and also those who are aware of what their computers can handle in the next couple of months after release.   As far as the story of the game goes, this game had one of the most strong plots of any of the Storm game. It is a toss up between this one and Strom 2. The beginning portion of the game isn't animated which I was a little dissapointed about, but it eventually goes to all animation just like the other storm games. Any Naruto fan will love this game but you need to make sure you can run it first. You basically get every major character even to appear in the anime/manga.  In conclusion, buy the game if you know what you are getting into. Steam refund is always there if you can't run the game in it's current state.",

On launch day I was having connection issues/dropping games, but today I have been able to play 20+ ranked matches without any connection drops or dqs.

In world exploration (which sometimes felt like playable cutscenes) and mindlbowing cutscenes made it truely something special. So of course with something of that quality I expected the sequal to be at least as good or better, but it's not. For the most part it's just crappy still-frames from the anime. If they were trying to save time and money, why not use clips FROM the anime instead of pictures... why they chose to actively make the game worse for no reason is beyond me.   Not to mention the constant crashes, every time an emotional moment pops up in story mode the game crashes - making me have to start over a story segment JUST when it was getting good (making me watch Obito die over and over again is unforgivable). With some of the longer story segments, it makes it impossible to finish before a crash (seems to crash after I've been playing for a certain amount of time). Yes, I have tried all the 'fixes' nothing has worked, the game is broken for some people and that's something that needs to be fixed.  IF they had continued the same quality for story mode and not had such horrendous unfixable crashing, I'd say this game would be another masterpiece as it has everything else that made the previous speical, such as the theatric battles and easy to use but fun movesets, HUUGE character roster, oh-so-shiny jutsu effects and all that other goodness. But no, they just had to mess up the best part of the series - it was an amazing adaption of the Naruto story, and for me the only adaption I care as I could never get into the anime because of it's length and am not much of a manga fan. It's really a shame, could have been something truely great.",

There are alot of negative reviews going on about this game due to people having issues with the game running which actually got me worried for a while about getting the game but i had 0 issues so far and has been the most fun experience ever...plus no fillers like the anime so 4.5/5 MUST PLAY IF YOU ARE A NARUTO FAN BECAUSE THE ANIME IS NEVER GOING TO FINISH",

Good Graphic Performance even if some guys just will not admin it. The online works fine, however there are some changes from storm 3 theres They took away the spectator mode in Tournament Mode &amp; Endless. And that really sucks .. so in this game we are pretty much stuck with the Mode called RANKED .. there you fight your opponents to win BP = Battle Points and fight to the top of the table. WICH is not that bad .. HOWEVER with this Mode only alive this game can be pretty boring in the end after you completed the story mode. And that's not all .. People in this Mode RANKED can Rage Quit Whenever They Want to Keep Their '' BP '' and not get punished for it wich sucks really bad. Also the gameplay mechanics does not effect me to much, JUMP Just like an '' Frog '' and you will do fine! cool with the 3 round system and the leader system though .. now you can play your two or three favorite characters In the same match. So i have to recommend this game for the fans, this is not for everyone.",

Negative:  Story mode is incredibly short and feels like a series of boss battles.  Story mode barely introduces you to actual gameplay.  Quick time events basically can't be lost unless you are AFK.

The gameplay itself is overall fairly smooth; it gets bad when you're doing 'afterimages' or 'cutscenes' in which the game goes to the same clunky broken UI and you almost always fail the quick-time requirements.  I currently use the Razer Sabertooth and there are moments where it just stops working period. Othertimes that it works perfect, and sometimes somewhere in between.  The character options are exciting, awesome and the new features are great. Problem is right now is the game is so unoptimized that it's effectively broken.

Really unacceptable for a 'final storm'game.Overall the game does'nt seem to have any noticable frame dips and load times are very minimal.HOWEVER ONLINE suffers greatly from lag and connections issues and has not been fixed!  Story 9/10 -very good at telling newcomers and longtime naruto fans kishimotos story pretty straight foward.  Replay value 7/10-DLC is pretty BS, should have been included in the game but as long as you have sombody local to play with its actually a really enjoyble time.

For the most part, they just more reasons to downvote the game other than just 'cap-30-fps- the-game-must-be- suck'. If you want to know how bad port looks like, just take a look at FF-O gameplays.  Overall, I upvote this game:  Pros: - The combat system changes back to before Revolution Drive system - Beautiful cutscenes - The game loads much faster than the previous versions in the series - New leader systems for those that like to create chain combos and creative gameplays - Story mode for those who like to experience combat of the game right away but still able to catch up with the main story and adventure mode for those who like to wander around. - Earning moneying is way easier compare to the previous version. I have almost 3 millions Ryo after just finishing story mode.  Cons: - They animated Sakura. Useless piece of ♥♥♥♥   -- Sorry for the bad grammar, you get the points.

Laggy menus. Crashes. Audio bugs (which have been patched). And before you ask, yes my computer meets and in fact exceeds all the minimum requirements (Intel i7, NVidia GeForce 900 M, 8 GB Ram - you get the point).  As a huge Naruto fan and recent crossover gamer into PC gaming, it's a true letdown when you preorder a promising game and you get a steaming hot, sloppy, pile of ♥♥♥♥ instead.  I tried the forum posted solutions, all 7 of them actually, with no success - from ensuring my dedicated GPU was the one being used, to the Tormunds executables (ALL of them). It helped bump me up to about 20 FPS average but still with a whole lot of lag. Refunded immediately after exhausting every option and realizing Friday's patch did nothing to fix the FPS issue.  Will definitely consider rebuying if Bandai Namco and/or CC2 decide to own up to their mistakes and apologetically release an optimized patch that the fans deserve.

From where your 3d settings are at the left, you want to click manage 3d settings 3. you want to select the program to customise as your storm 4 game and finally 4. Change from your auto select/global default graphics processor to your High qualtiy NVIDIA processor. It sounds hard but just by entering the control panel you'll figure out what to do but anyways after that I still had to turn some settings down but my game works super fast with no crashes and amazing gameplay so I do recommend this game definietely and I hope people thumb this up so others can see how to fix this.",

I'm not going to pretend the game doesn't have it's issues, and I would urge Bandai-Namco to focus on the ones most players are having. But as it currently stands, I'm enjoying the game without any issues that would render it unplayable for most. Should something change my opinion, I will update this review to reflect it.",

Edit: The second time I ran it, it ran perfectly, there were a few frame drops at the beginning of story missions, but they were weirdly only 10 seconds or so long. They would end after that.   So a quick review, because I haven't played this in a bit: It's just like the other storm games with new additions. The wall fighting s really cool, the new characters are welcomed, and the story line has caught me up on a show I haven't been willing to watch due to fillers. But it's unfortunately just another iteration. I haven't wanted to play for a bit because none of my friends got it.   I recommend it because I got what I expected, and I think we need to stop ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on games for giving us exactly what we expected, and why we bought it in the first place. But it's a Storm game. Every combo in the game is done with only the circle/B buttion. The stages you fight on don't matter. The characrers are virtually identical with combos and moves. It's not a good fighting game: It's a good Naruto game. It's been the same game for the entire Storm franchise.   If you haven't bought the last few Storm games, like me, I'd get this. But hopefully you have friends or like playing online.",

            "review_text": "**POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD**   So I've finally had the chance the see the ending of the Manga animated in some way (Game came out before the Anime finished the story) and I'm pretty happy how they ended the story in the game. At first I was suprised that the story mode was so short, since it started in midst of the 4th great ninja war. But they implemented the story prior the the war into the adventure mode. I disliked the 'diashows' of anime screenshots they used to tell parts of the story, some of those screenshots we definitely not suited to be used in the game. Other that that the animation was nice and the last fight of Naruto and Sasuke was very well done.  In the adventure mode you're able to carry out different type of missions and replay old events of the story. You can travel between different locations and decide whether you want to follow the main events or carry out the side quests. In addition to the story and adventure mode, the game offers a survival and a tournament mode.   The fighting system is similar to previous Storm titles and is pretty straightforward. You can fight alone or in a team of two/three people. I liked the addition of character swapping while fighting, it added more diversity to the fights. Most of the Manga/Anime characters are among the playable characters and we'll get more in later DLCs. Every character has it's own skillset and awakening mode.   I had no problems regarding resolution, performance and settings.  All in all I really liked the game and would recommend it, but if you own the previous storm titles, wait til this game is on sale, since there aren't huge differences between those games. 8/10",

Now as a game its nice its presenting to the player the continue from NSUNS3 and starts with the fight of Madara &amp; Hashirama. After that it jumbs to Naruto,Kakash,Guy VS Obito. And after that we all know how the story goes.  (Also to mention even though im a hardcore Naruto fan i got bored of playing the Single Player the first day i bought the game and re-started to play the game after two days ...again the same got bored after 2-3 missions and stopped for another two days it took me one and a half weeks to finish the whole game because i was bored all the time)  7.5/10 the Single Player experience.  About the Multiplayer i only have negative's.  The reason for that is because the fights depend on the Hosts or the guy with the strongest internet and trust me so far i tried playing with at least 20+ people which i always lag so badly that you just get angry and let the guy win because there is nothing for you to do. Someone told me 'You Host and the other guy will lag instead of you' i did that and still the same.  NSUNS2 &amp; 3 My lord... i dont want to sound badass but on my Xbox i was undefeatable never lagged ..never nothing.  Some of you may say 'Oh he just thinks the game is average because he looses all the time' No trust i accept defeats really well to a point i dont care. I know there are tons of people out there way better than me ...just havent met them yet. But as far as it goes with the New Naruto game its like a Big Bad Brother in the Multiplayer experience.  I also read that there are hackers or some crap like that. But in my situation i dont really think that was the case just to much lag for absolutly no reason.  Overall as a game im giving it 5/10 because of the Single Player  Im only gonna recommend the game because im a Naruto Fan and i want more people to experience this amazing story.",

However this series manages to pull the look and feel of Naruto off very well. In the past id played fights in one of the games before seeing it in the anime and i didn't mind. This because the games just look so good. the fighting system isn't deep but delivers on the promise of being able to replay the fights from the series, the main campaign is solid despite being the most difficult part of the series to adept to videogames. It still manages to deliver a solid campaign. This game does bring back memories of Asuras Wrath which i liked. Because in the campaign the ratio between watching and playing is only slightly better here. Besides this there is a tournament/survival mode. These are fun if a bit grindy. the last mode is iv played is the adventure mode. This is a filler story which is very grindy and i would have traded for a bigger campaign mode. a lot of assets from previouse games are back but that is not a huge drawback. I hope they continue the series and go the DBZ route and make bigger and better campaigns and keep retelling the Naruto story in new cool ways.",

The gameplay is awesome eventhough some of the fights were real tough (eg VS Madara, Kaguya, Obito in Sage Form). Gameplay is solid and it simulates the real fights that actually happened in the manga.  When I finished the story, it made me teared up too, just like how the manga made me teared up. Sad to hear that this is the final installment for the Ultimate Ninja Storm series, but it was definitely a great run!  Again, thanks to NSUNS4, I was able to relive my childhood memories once more.

The main being this is an obvious port and unless you have and Xbox 360/One controller handy you will have no way of being able to even navigate to the settings menu because all the buttons are layed out on the xbox format. Would really appreciate a higher quality port for a $60 game (I'm glad I got it on sale when I did.)",
