            "review_text": "It gets a thumbs up but...only just. Why?  Well basically, Mahjong is just like learning the Japanese language: overcomplicated. Why would you try to hook Europeans up with a complex game from the Eastern lands who are used to overcomplicating things without a USEFUL tutorial of any kind whatsoever? And before you say 'look up a guide' - I did, and it does not explain things such as why you would chow or pung anything when the point of the game is to get a certain amount of pairs/sets in your hand to win.   For example, calling a chow only seems to set aside 2 tiles from your own hand + a matching tile that an opponent discarded, without seemingly contributing to the objective to win at all. Basically to players new to mahjong it feels like this is a negative move, because you lose 2 tiles from your hand which could have contributed to a certain combo later on. Of course there is a point to making this move though, but the current mahjong learning guides out there do not explain it well at all. A simple tooltip or tutorial for something such as this would've cleared up the confusion and would make the game playable and probably fun for people new to Mahjong. But no, we've gotta do this the Japanese way.  The reason why I'm not downvoting the game is because I like the art a lot and the game would probably be fun to play if the guides on how to play Mahjong were more clear. Not even sure if I can fault the creators of the guides for that though because as said in the beginning, the game really feels too complicated for its own good. Only pick this up if you know someone who understands most of the Riichi Mahjong rules and is willing to help you out with it.",

OK I find a bug in this rubbish game.If you are top at allast you won the allast game, you'll find the game continued.I can't win the game until I fly someone else or someone other win. so this game: 0.5/10 music 0/10 cg 0/10 mahjong 0/10 AI 0/10 so why I buy this game?BECAUSE I'M JUST A ♥♥♥♥ING STUPID AND HAPPY PLUS ONE!",
