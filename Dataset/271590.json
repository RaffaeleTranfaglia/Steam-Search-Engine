            "review_text": "The PC version of GTA V is definitely the best version. We had to wait really long, but the game finally came out in a fantastic state. Rockstar obviously put a lot of time into the PC port/version. I'm usually against pre-ordering games, but I made one exception this year for GTA, and im happy with my decision. I didn't do it for the pre-order bonus (because that was frankly just a disappointing money cheat) , I did it just so I could preload all GB's in time for launch, because the game is ridiculously big.   I'm running it at 60-90 fps on 1920x1080 with most things on 'high', except for the advanced options, which is something you should only use if your running SLI or one really good card. I have a Nvidia gtx 680, which is a few years old now, so im very impressed with how good I can get the game to run. You can also use GeForce experience with GTA, because Nividia released a update for that day before launch.  You can play GTA in first or third person mode, and simply change between them on your controller. All cars have different interiors and looks when you are driving in first person. Some textures are a little blurry in first person, but that is something to expect in a game of this size. Fighting, swimming, walking can also be done in first person, so you can just pick what you like the best.  If you have an SSD drive that is big enough for this game you should probably use that for GTA, because the loading screens without it is sometimes very long. It's one of the only complains I have with GTA actually. Thankfully thats just when you are loading into story mode or online, because once you are in the big world there is no invisible walls or loading screens.  Singleplayer is fun and the 3 main characters are all very well written. You can swap between them in the open world, but also in certain quests. Michael, Trevor and Franklin are very different from eachother which makes the game more interesting then GTA IV's only character, Niko.  GTA online is probably what some people will spend a ton of time in. I really just bought it for the single-player experience, but after playing a few hours with my friends I have to say that GTA online is actually really fun. I think the missions will get kind off repetitive in the long run, but to play free-roam with friends will never get old. You also unlock heist in level 12, so that might refresh things even more.  I play this game with an xbox controller and it seems like all friends I've talked to is doing the same thing. I strongly recommend it, at least for the driving. You can enable auto-aim on your controller if you think shooting with it is too hard, or you can swap between your keyboard+mouse in combat, and use controller for driving. When you crash your car and get hit the controll vibrates, which I think makes you feel more immersed in the game.  I tried the PC controls and I didn't like them at all. For example you have to hit 'Z' to see how many players are on your server in online mode. You can however rebind all keys on keyboard, mouse, and controller so thats really good, but the default ones on keyboard are not great im afraid.  GTA is a fantastic open world game that will no doubt be played for many years to come. I have already played it a lot and I feel like I have much more leveling to do in GTA online, much more to do and explore in singleplayer and many hours of fun with my close friends to come. Singleplayer was all I really needed, so I will just see GTA online as a plus.  Well done Rockstar! This is the best PC version you have ever made and I can see that you put a lot of effort, time and love into creating it. Strongly recommend this title to all my friends, whether your the single or multiplayer guy, you will have a ton of fun. This will probably be one of the best games released this year.",

            "review_text": " Hey guys, I don't usually write reviews, but Grand Theft Auto V is a game that is absolutely worth it.   A game that breaked most impressive records of Guiness Book:     Best-selling action-adventure video game in 24 hours (12 milion copies)  Best-selling video game in 24 hours (564 milion$)  Fastest entertainment property to gross $1 billion  Fastest video game to gross $1 billion  Highest-grossing video game in 24 hours  Highest revenue generated by an entertainment product in 24 hours (including Hollywood movies)  Most viewed trailer for an action-adventure video game  Most viewed trailer of an action-adventure video-game (800+ milion views)    Graphics  1. Graphics texture optimization is absolutely incredible. The game runs smooth on any kind of GPU's and CPU's as long as you can meet the minimum system requirements. By the way, these requirements are actually not that high for a game that has such breathtaking graphic details.  2. Graphic details are the best I have seen, especially in an open-world game. If I was to tell you all about this topic, I would probably need to make a coffee to keep me awake for many hours, because boy there are lots to talk about. I'm just gonna write some of the features that stood up for me.   a)  Day/Night cycle recreation.  Sure this is not something new in its essence, it has been done before and not just in GTA, but the way we see it here it's what's amazing. The way the light shifts from one period of the day to another it's off the charts. You don't even realize when the afternoon becomes evening. The only way you can tell, it's that a beautiful sunset light is falling down upon you.  b)  Rain.  Again, not a new feature, actually is quite an old one  BUT  the way it's been reproduced in GTAV ... You can literally see every rain drop falling on the ground and splashing itself at impact. Apart from the obvious, what makes rain so special in GTAV ? Well,  THE SOUND . This is something that not many people talk about, yet is one of the breathtaking features of the game.The way Rockstar Games produced the sound in game its mind blowing and it has a great effect on the rain (besides everything else).  c)  Night time, baby!  Sure we had night in GTA IV and even before that, so why do I mention this ? Well, because the city never looked better under the moonlight shadows. I am not talking just about the graphics aspect. What I'm saying is that the night in GTAV gives you the impression of actual liveliness; the whole city comes to life. It's just like in the real big cities when people go out at night to party or to do whatever.  3. Cars are the best looking and are way ahead those we've seen in previous GTA's. I'm not talking about a direct comparison, because of the obvious reason (2015-2010) but what I'm trying to say is that I personally wasn't that impressed at the time by the cars/helis/planes in GTA4 as I am now in GTAV.  Gameplay and Features  Oh yea, the gameplay options and features are the best weapon for GTAV to fight against any competitor now and in the years to come.  1.  Car Control  I feel like thanking Rockstar games for actually doing a great job in this matter. Car control was preety much garbage in GTA IV and for this reason alone I had no big expectations for this new series. Well, I was wrong. The car control is so well polished that it gave me the impression of playing NFS MW back in the day. Besides the control, there is the sound of the car's engine which is perfectly accurate.  2.  Randomness.  Now what in God's name I'm talking about?! Well, have you been driving down the coast or in the mountains or even in the city borders and happen to meed somebody out of the blue crying for your help ? A woman's that was about to get ♥♥♥♥♥, a kid who's bike was stolen, hitchhiker asking you to take her/him home, etc usually for a reward. If you think about that it dosnt sound like a big deal, but baby, this stuff gives GTAV a whole new dimension of impersonating reality in a video game.  3.  Los Santos Customs.  Again, not something new but let me tell you why this one is so damn special. Have you tried modifying the car's suspension? Of course you did, what am I saying! But have you actually paid attention of it's realism  AFTER  the change was made? Well, for those who haven't and for the one's who dont own the game yet, let me tell you that this feature is game-making. My favorite car in GTAV is the Grotti Carbonizzare also known as the Ferarri F12. Now think, how am I gonna drive that beast on the city's roads? Especially in areas like Groove, Hilwood, Rockford. These are just some of the areas that have bumpy roads, so you cant really drive a Ferarri in these parts of the town. Well, you can. Modifying the suspension to a higher state doesn't just make for visual effects, but actually changes the way the car handles the bumpy roads, turns, hard turns. BTW, if you move your mouse besides the car while taking a turn, you can actually see the suspension come into play even on lowest graphic settings. For me, this is one of the best things I've seen in this game.   4.  Activities.  Driving, mission making, robberies, flying, hunting, diving, piloting aircrafts, submarines, boats, golf, tennis, cards, smoke weed, racing, playing the stock market. You will never get bored in this game, not even in Single Player mode.    There are so many more things to talk about, but the review would be monstruosly long, so In a few words: buy the game, it will be the best investment you have done in a PC game. For those who thaught the review was too long and skipped to the bottom, I can tell you in short, that this game excels in every aspect:: Weapons look so realistic in First Person mode, cars have a mind blowing realistic control, weather has never been better reproduced, etc. GL&amp;HF  ",

Only overshadowed by San Andreas and its missing features and contents I wish it were here... such as crouching during shooting, horse races to bet, cassino heists and mini-games such as pool and   hot coffe   things kept out from the final game. Yet, swapping the main character middle-game is a innovative move we still feel. Large balls and guts were required from the devs to do it. The work of a master if you ask me. GTA IV was a mix between Shoot'em Up, Pulp Fiction and Fight Club while GTA V sounds like the best Heists movies and totally like Cheech &amp; Chong's adventures with mary-ru-ana. I couldn't stop laughing. It was worthy to wait for the PC version, I don't want to be a PCnazi here, but we're the master race indeed. So I think I'm now after that statement.

Small things are important and gta 5 has a lot of them and you are not getting bored that fast , a lot of mini games and missions to play alone or also with friends. One of the better things are the heists , you need to cooperate with your mates to succeed. Gta 5 has also a beautiful, expertly realised open world who despite appearances isn't that small at all , a lot of things to do and areas to explore. One of the things that annoys you in Gta 5 is the amount of hackers you have to face every day in most encountered sessions but at the end of the day you can live with that .  PROS + : -Fun, enjoyable and well written story. -A lot of missions to play either with friends or alone. -Beautiful graphics. -Gorgeous open world. -Heists. -Good customization for cars. -Characters are awesome. -Impressive degree of freedom. -First-person camera.  CONS - : -Not that great MM. -Large number of hackers. -Character customization could be better. -Not enough choices that affect the gameplay further on the story mode.  In few words Gta 5 it's an amazing and fun game without doubt , it's like a next-gen remaster of what we have experienced and played so far. You can spend a large amount of hours playing with friends and you still will find new things to do every day . It begs to be played all over again especially when you have company. It's a must for everyone to try out. Those who didn't play that masterpiece yet , they definitely should ! I recommend this game to anyone without remorse .  Cheers !",

            "review_text": "I recommend this game but only to a certain degree, it's more like thumb sideways, and here's why:  Singleplayer is probably where you will get your money's worth. It's fairly entertaining through out the whole game, depending on your personal tastes, and there is enough content to keep you occupied for at least 100 hours (if you are a completionist type). Admittedly the story is kinda mediocre and isn't going to blow you away with it's storytelling or big twists but the gameplay is fun and almost perfect for the first time in GTA series although previous titles had better story and atmosphere.   There is also Rockstar Editor for the creative types to make interesting videos and enough mods around to keep the game relevant way past it's life cycle. Just remember to revert your game back to vanilla before going to multiplayer because mods tend to be flagged as cheats and can get you banned, so beware.   Now multiplayer is whole different beast. First and foremost it is very time consuming in the sense that everything will take a while to achieve. You can still have a lot of fun doing all sorts of jobs and activities with friends while being a low level with no money but you will be at a disadvantage at every corner. You need to level up to be more competent in missions to earn more money to buy stuff which is unlocked by being a high level and screwing around in free mode won't get you far. You have to literally work for your level and money which may sound discouraging for some people with little time on their hands.  For that case you can buy Shark Cards, in-game money paid with real money, micro-transactions if you will. You don't have to buy them (I certainly never did) but if earning money the usual way is a grind for you then there's this. Shark Cards are also the reason for the countless free updates as well as the reason why they abandoned singleplayer for good. Heists are the biggest money makers but doing them as a low level is a sure way to fail a lot and annoy your teammates. Personally I do not recommend tackling them before reaching level 50.  And of course there are hackers. Every game has them but GTA 5 has quite a few of them thanks to the shoddy network infrastructure. You see this game uses 'Peer to Peer' connection meaning technically there are no servers, in a lobby everyone connects to everyone. This makes for absurdly long loading times for connecting to public lobbies and transforms PvP into a chore where depending on your opponents connection it almost seems like a drop of a dice decides whether or not your shots will actually register.  So with no actual servers to run checks on people to know who's hacking, hackers are running rampant thanks to the netcode. That could be fixed with dedicated servers but the last modding team that tried to mod that into GTA 5 got their SC accounts permabanned, so yeah... And Rockstar's own methods to remedy that by screwing with the code have instead caused a 10% - 20% decrease in performance for a lot of people. The game may never run as smooth as it did on launch day :(  Hacking got better these days but still my advice for now is to avoid public lobbies and just stick with your friends in private lobbies instead. You'll also get the added bonus of faster loading times in private sessions :D   Bottom line / TL;DR :  If you're a single player person then this game has you covered with fun gameplay but with a so-so story while multiplayer, although fun at times, requires from you a lot of time and a lot of patience to put up the bull s**t it often throws at you.",

            "review_text": "When did this come out for pc?  Anyways single player as to be expected is solid on all fronts even adding 3 main characters to play around with this time. Multiplayer is the real meat of this game expecting you and your friends to grind it out to reach high levels and get rich. Problem is the servers are terrible. Constantly crashing and having trouble grouping up with your friends. DId I mention load times are crazy long? I wrote this whole review by the time my lobby started up. Have to go to single player just to start a friend only lobby. Missions are really the only way to level up fast and those are randomly locked behind rockstars crappy matchmaking menus. I can't state enough how bad these servers are. But they are updating the game every so often with more content for multiplayer.   In the end what you have here can be very fun and also very frustrating. This is not next gen but it is fun and definitely worth it's sale price on steam.

            "review_text": "A Masterpiece thats worth the wait In a world filled with money grabbing devs, useless DLCs and notorious but popular locked contents that were supposed to be part of the game was stripped away and made into season passes. These practices angered a lot of avid gamers such as myself and needless to say it is revolting to see that games are being treated untruthful to the genre's original roots.  2015 has not been a great year for games with promising titles such as Evolve, Dying Light and for the ps4 Order 1866 failing to deliver leading to disappointments for many. Doubts started to creep in and some suspect that even the best upcoming titles such as MGS: PP and even Witcher 3 might suck.  Amidst the chaos, one star shines, above all, its gleaming, bright and pure radiance covered the sky full of light, hope, and dreams. This star is known as Rockstar.  GTA V was originally released as a console exclusive and has received praise across the board with 10/10 ratings. I did not buy into the hype as I had little memory of playing GTA IV 5-6 years ago and so I hesitated and waited.  Suddenly, Rockstar decided to port it over to the PC and when I say 'Port' I didn't mean Crapcom's lazy ♥♥♥ port with missing features and bad optimizations. I mean a whole new experience build from the ground up adding exclusive features, implementing bug-free experience, detailed PC settings that are both well optimized and greatly refined. The PC version is hands down the superior and most definitive way to play GTA V.  The Story The story revolves around 3 characters allowing you to switch freely in between. The characters introduced are Franklin, Michael, and Trevor. Each individual has an interesting back story and personality with Franklin growing up in the rough Compton-like neighbourhood but is fed up with all the gangbanging and killing and instead wants to turn and make honest or perhaps fast dollars.  Leading him into the shady world of doing vehicle repossessions and eventually meet Michael who is an ex-bank robber now retired, living off of the money from his final heist. Wanting a peaceful life seems to be too much to ask for and as trouble always come looking for him. With family on the line, Michael is now back in the game.  Trevor, on the other hand, is Michael's brother in crime and from many years of doing 'Professional business' the two formed unshakable bonds. In everyday life, Trevor is one violent ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who runs 'Trevor Enterprise' a meth cooking laboratory. Nobody wants to mess with this psycho maniac as he will do anything to keep his business running smooth.  The world The state of Lost Santos is a recreation of modern day Los Angeles and it is amazingly detailed, graphically beautiful and vibrant. Popular landmarks were represented accurately and are a wonder to look at. The world and its people live and breath the same air as you do and will react to everything that has happened locally or globally which is reflected in news and radio channels.   The size of the world is also incredibly huge containing varies geographical locations such as downtown area, desert countryside, narrow mountain roads and luxurious Beverly hills.   Talking about radio channels, there are hundreds of tracks available and I rarely hear repeated songs. The tracks were well selected with West Coast classics being my favorite channel constantly play tunes from rap icons from Tupac, N.W.A to Snoop Dogg and many others instantly recognizable.  Music genres have rich varieties and there is something for everyone. In addition, you can import your own soundtracks into the built-in radio to create the self-radio and it can be shared and heard by friends on the passenger seats.  Voice Acting/Animation The voice acting were spot on the moment you hear Franklin talking with Lamar, each character feels realistic and packed with emotions that can be related to. Even the pedestrians will often talk to their loved ones or friends on the phone.  The animation and facial expression were on par with LA noir, creating the perfect balance between gameplay and storytelling.  GTA V excels at the fact that it doesn't take itself too serious showing constant humor, racial slurs and stereotypical aspects of different cultures and races. It is well executed in GTA V as it makes the player feel integral to the community whether you are rich or poor or the areas you live in.  Vehicles GTA V offers a huge selection of vehicles with really well-designed handling and overall great driving mechanics.Cars were also smartly placed with richer areas containing more high-end sports and luxury cars and other areas containing more standard commuting cars and trucks on the countryside.  By simply driving around you will instantly recognize Audi R8, Bugatti Veyron, Porsche GT, Lamborghinis, and Ferraris.  The intricacies of the mechanics expand deeper when reaching out into the air as aircraft has totally different controls with some degree of learning curve and practices getting used to.  Multiplayer GTA V is not complete without its popular online multiplayer. With Rockstar well-prepared launch, every single thing were fully functional since day one and I have not crashed once in my 50 or so hours of gameplay.  Character creation has you choose the heritage and inheritance based on your parents to give a general outlook and an accurate template of the character. Which can then be customized further to become a unique representation of your online avatar. But choose wisely as other characters do not share levels, stats and money stored in the bank.  As you level up and progress the character stats you will encounter countless of activities all over the map whether you are into shootout, robbery or racing, there's something for everyone.  There are also plenty of competitive multiplayer modes to choose from standard team death match to car death match it has literally too many features and modes for me to list all here and you definitely need to play everything for yourself.  Finally, online mode introduces heist once you reach level 12. If you think Payday has great heist, you might need to think again because GTA V's heist is definitely on another level. Heist has you assemble your own team and carefully selecting who's job is what and how it will be executed is the key to success.  Each heist contains many smaller missions and these missions serve as preparation jobs. Once all the preparation jobs are completed you will unlock the finale of the heist. A longer, intense, action packed and adrenaline rushing action set pieces perfectly created by Rockstar. It really goes to show the high production value because it is mind-blowing fun. After 10 failures and 1 success, it makes me think I deserve that huge paycheck.  For hardcore players and the perfectionist, heists can be replayed to allow perfect plan execution for the mastermind. Completing extra challenges will reward you handsomely.  With 80% of my play time sucked in multiplayer, I have only just scratched the surface. There are still tons of content I have yet to experience and tons of missions I have not played. For the asking price of £39.99 it is absolutely a must buy as online alone will contain hundreds if not thousands of hours of gameplay and in the future more may be added.  If you ask me 'Should I buy GTA V'  I say 'Hell ♥♥♥♥ing yeah'  The only aspect of the game I didn't like is the long loading time when transitioning from online to story mode and between screens when selecting missions but then again it is understandable considering the size of the game.  Rockstar pays attention to details in a sandbox game with unparalleled gameplay and extremely rich content packed with a fully realized world to experience in first person mode. GTA V sets the standard for what an AAA game should be and likewise, Rockstar sets the standard to how an AAA developer should make a game.  10/10",

            "review_text": "tl;dr: Don't buy if you're not prepared for a cancerous community. Singleplayer:  By far the most interesting / close to best story on grand theft auto I've ever played, a 2nd place right after San Andreas, The whole 3 Character feature really does please most players with different tastes, I myself as a big fan of San Andreas found most fun playing Franklin, occasionaly going to Grove st. and such and I can see how 'maining' a certain character can change and better your gameplay experience. Just be wary when reinstalling to fix a bug or such, I did so and ended up losing my 82% Completion save file which Rockstar nor Steam could help with since they dont save your files in online.  Multiplayer:   holy sh*t    Let me begin with the actual fun parts of Multiplayer:  You want to be an elite bank robber ?  - You can play multiple bank heists with lester the molester and earn a quick buck  You want to steal valuable information about military grade weapons and break people out of prison? - You can work for a guy known as Agent 14 And do exactly that and ♥♥♥♥ over a private military known as Merryweather  You want to put all of that ♥♥♥♥ to the side and do some good old gang related missions? - Lamar is your man, call him and you'll get enough work such as starting gang battles, stealing lowriders and ambushing gangs in their neighborhoods, parking lots and even funerals.  Bored of the missions? -Races, Deathmatches, All sorts of events, You can even have fun just playing in free mode with a friend and do all sorts of things.  Sounds pretty amazing doesn't it? Well It's far from amazing.  The people rating negative are all complaining about being banned for nothing , but when I go into a random lobby 2/10 lobbies actually have people modding and going invincible, spawning anything from tanks, jets, to ♥♥♥♥in' wind mills infront of your house, if it's not that then it's some russian kid and a french dude screaming at each other over the mic. So after all of that you go to the escape menu and try to find a new session right? Well if you're from EU have fun sitting in a loading screen for at least 2 minutes   Every. Single. Time.   Want to play by yourself? Have fun getting kicked out of heists for your low level and getting completely destroyed in death matches or any other kind of mode by a chinese guy thats level 8000 and is playing with over 200 ping, or a modder that screams in your ear the whole time you play and you have to spend half of the time actually trying to figure out his name.  Also they try to sell multiplayer by giving you a 'wide' selection between characters, which is partly true, if you want to look like a Niko bellic with some kind of syndrome. Everybody walking around has the same face and most of them have the same haircut, and they're either in some crap like a suit and sweat pants or an edgy full tactical team outfit Who drive around in their armored cars and do nothing but kill people and go into passive mode after.    Overall, The game is good, but the community and character customization and multiplayer in general has a far, far way to go.",

            "review_text": "back in my mid 40's I had what any normal person has... a midlife crisis. I had an urge for adrenaline that I just couldn't get. I tried joining a triathlon, that didn't end well with my heart condition. I tried smoking weed for the first time but nothing really happened and my whole house smelled like pizza, I tried being extremely racist to black people in order for them to assault me but the only thing that happened was that they dismissed me as crazy and continued on with their day. One time, I remember, I even tried cocaine but to no avail. I simply wanted a rush, an experience, something that would send my heart racing (yet not overboard). I wanted adrenaline. On a fine summer evening, I walked to the grocery store to buy a pack of cigs when out of the corner of my eye I see a man in a mask with a gun. He tells us all to get down on the ground or he will shoot us and skin our family alive. So, naturally, we all got on the ground and complied with our captor. My heart was racing, I couldn't believe this was actually happening! I went for my phone to call the police but he saw me and kept me in his crosshair for a good 15 minutes while his friend cleared the register. After collecting all the money, they were making their way out when suddenly a cop turns the corner of the door and aims his pistol at one of the robbers. He yells 'Freeze ♥♥♥♥♥♥!' and the robbers stopped in their tracks. The cop told the robbers to drop their weapons and they did so. The cop then yelled 'Holy ♥♥♥♥ he is resisting!' the criminal then started to say 'but, I alread...' when the cop layed down the criminals life. The other criminal stood their shocked and frightened at his fallen comrad when the cop says 'Now its your turn, bite the counter!' which, in my opinion, was an odd request. The criminal listened to the officer of the law and put his teeth around the edge of the counter. The hero &amp; hunk of a police officer then said 'Say goodnight, ♥♥♥♥♥♥!' and proceded to stomp the black mans head in. I was so amazed by what I had just witnessed all I could do was start a slow clap, everyone in the store was screaming and yelling in amazement at the officers fine work. It was the rush I needed, it was amazing and I highly reccomend the experience.",

            "review_text": "As many of you all know, GTA V is a huge game. It began way back in the day with GTA 3 and ever since then has continued to get better and better. I do love the game, and I have completely enjoyed every title they've released. Unfortunately there are also some negative areas too and the this is by no real fault of Rockstar to be honest as with ANY online game, there will always be those few that ruin it for others. This game is plagued with cheaters/modders and whilst rockstar do their 'thing' to try to keep this as low as possible, it is simply not working. At the time of writing this, the game has at least one or more cheaters/modders in every session you goto. It's quite frustrating since there are a lot of rumours that claim people can get banned through the actions of a cheater/modder doing something on their end which the detection system thinks you (the innocent party) is doing and thus bans you. I'm a bit of a programmer/coder so I genuinely find this theory hard to believe and I honestly think it's all a lie but there are a lot of complaints by people claiming that this is what happened to them so I'm open to the possibility but genuinely feel they're simply lying. If this is actually true, then Rockstar need to sort this out.  Now, putting aside the modders/cheaters the only other thing that really frustrates me is the loading times. I have neveer been in an game whereby you spend more time loading (the same map!) than you do actually playing the game. I mean, unless you just stay in the lobby....the loading times are just unreal. Even going from the lobby to a mission lobby such as Races e.t.c there's a loading screen there, and if you cancel that, another loading screen to get back to the map that you spent 10mins loading just prior to the race. It's a joke. How can there honestly be THIS much loading required when what they're loading is the same map! I mean, all missions and the alike, are all loading the same map...the only difference is whether or not cops are disabled or whether certain peds will be needed and spawn at X Y Z e.t.c which doesn't require any loading... (Yes I've done some modding in GTA V for single player so I know this doesnt require loading screens) yet we still have loading screens for everything!  As you can tell i play a lot of online GTA V and havent spoken much about single player.  Single player is great, the city really is full of life. It's a shame my R9 290x broke down and now I can't play the game in the way that I used to. Non-the-less, the only thing I found a bit annoying was the fact that we're playing 3 characters at the same time. I think it's great to try new things but I honestly didn't like the fact that as soon as you got to the point where you started to like a character, and know the storyline and what's going on and enjoy it all, boom, you're no longer able to play that character because you have to play as one of the other 2 characters to continue the story further....and then the same thing would repeat whereby you start getting into again, and boom, now must change character one again. For me this was the onlly negative thing really with the story line. I would absolutely recommend this game, I've spent many hours in this game although you do get bored and stop playing for a month or two here and there, you always come back for more sooner or later!",

            "review_text": "GTA V is indeed the most beautiful, vast and detailed GTA title of the whole series, but for me its story is not just the best. I found the first half quite entertaining, discovering new characters and their relationships, trying the first fantastic heists (too few of them!) and exploring this amazing open world Rockstar so expertly created. But on the long run I think missions became quite boring, and secondary activities (so many of these) not so interesting, while the ending (one of three possible) left me quite indifferent. I often laughed to some scenes and I cared about the three main characters' fate in many occasions, but never found a particular bond with any of them. In this regard I just prefer GTA IV.  On the other hand this is the first time I found a GTA multiplayer viable and entertaining, even with that horrible and unintuitive matchmaking system. In fact I suggest to create a party of friends or people you know well and play together, because playing with casuals can be, for the most part, quite frustrating, This becomes crucial when you need to coordinate in the complex and fantastic online Heists; like in the singleplayer portion of GTA V, it is really a shame we have only 5 of these! While online missions and activities are numerous and varied, I found Heists the real gem of this game's multiplayer.  Technically it is very well optimized, gorgeous in some instances (sunset and sunrise), the game world so detailed and well built, the sound department characterized by amazing voices and a fantastic soundtrack. Nothing out of place.  So, is this the best GTA ever created? As a whole package I definitely say yes, without a doubt! I think that Rockstar just needs to improve its storytelling, because for the rest, they are just the masters!",

That is a stall technique and it gives away the fact you are about to lie through your teeth.  9..Don't say, 'I ain't got no dope. Why you wanna search my car?'

'Man you got me good. Look you can see the dope in my hand.'  19..A good defense when caught selling dope on video tape is not. 'That's not me, that's someone using my face.'",

Big and fun cities to drive and explore. Wonderful.  -Fantastic Performance- On all Max Graphics, 60 FPS constant, little to no lag, CPU and GPU performance does not have to crank at all to run the game.  -GTA Online Servers are not as ♥♥♥♥ at launch compared to the console release. Thank you.  -Gameplay- Single Player; Uber awesome- it's just wow, great characters, fun story and side quests; a living city. Wonderful.  -Gameplay- Multiplayer: Uber Uber Awesome- +I love it. Driving around with your friends, killing poor innocent players that are new to the game (like myself) that are at a low level while my friends are like level 80+. (as they played the hell out of the console version and transferred their character, lol.) +The jobs are super fun, but are more fun with friends. +The Heists; well designed, fun with four people, can VERY challenging, but awesome payout and really fun with good teamwork. +Housing and Garages; Many to choose from around town, you can buy them, invite friends into them, most if not all have garages, can store a Max for the most expensive 10 vehicles. Fun to mess around and get 'high' in-game with your friends in your apartment. +Vehicles; Planes and Cars- they are awesome, easy to drive, look wonderful, able to have much variety and steal most cars, put them in your garage! They become yours for essentially forever! (if you don't blow those up) Vehicles you buy are more or less permanent with the insurance ability. +Playing with friends in Free-mode: Drive around the vast city, encounter other players almost at random (and have huge fire-fights) to either kill each other or play together to control the server!  Cons: -Only 32 Players in one server? (What?)  -Server connection issues; They are not as bad as release on Console, but wow, I have had some issues myself and so have my friends when it comes to staying connected with the server during Free mode or heists. (it sucks even more when doing a Heist and your friend disconnects)  -Social Club: Damn it game devs, you got to stop it with this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Uplay, Battlelog and now this? AGAIN? It can be a hassle, its was terrible in GTA4 and thankfully its much improved, but is something that is forced on to the player. Why not just integrate steam's community system? The invite system is much better, the crews could be related to steam groups and it would provide us no need to create a external account to just play the damn game's online ability. I honestly don't hate it as much as its not to bad in this GTA; but this sets an example for other devs. It just provides another roadblock in playing the damn game.  I still give this game a 10 out of 10 as the cons are not a serious issue in the major factor to the games ability to be played or enjoyed. 32 players is suitable, but I wish there were more. Server connection issues are almost resolved at this point and social club is honestly not that bad for someone who is using it for the first time (as they will have no issues creating and logging-in).  Its a fantastic game and is totally worth the 50-60 dollars on steam. The pre-order bonus was really nice, with the 1,000,000 dollars you get for Franklin in the single player and your GTA Online character. Its a big helping boost without being detrimental.  Its so fun to play with friends or by yourself. GET IT.",

Prior to buying GTA V, I was almost hesitant to withdraw and focus myself elsewhere....but I'm glad I didnt.  This game runs FLAWLESSLY at 50-60fps on a 2012 rig.

First off, the thing that actually impressed me most about this game is the little things. For instance, I was playing as franklin and was going along the highway on a bike and noticed this fluttering around his sholders. At first I thought its was bad refresh rate, but then I realised its his shirt fluttering in the wind. Holy **** that's awesome that they included stuff like that. The list goes on about little things, but their are a few cons.   The only cons I could really find is crashing issues. Now this is different person to person. It's not my system either because I have a very powerful computer. It's just launch bugs which every game has. It almost makes me giddy thinking about all the bugs their gonna be fixing in the next couple months. Other than that this game is a must for any game enthusiest.   Thats my 2 cents.

It has got to be the most amazing pc port....... neh, pc game ever optimized. yeah you heard me, PC GAME. the scaling and smoothness was worth the delay, and def huge leaps in looks from its console counterparts.

Regardless, the story is fun and endulging and exciting, theres LOADS, and i do mean loads of graphics settings to cator to your systems needs. The graphics scaling and resource handling is out of this world!!....This is literally the most my PC's hardware has ever been used!; and efficiently and responsibly as well. The games detail is just out of this world! Walking around the city, every nook and crany is filled with random detail and the roads are just spectacular; makes the city seem so real how used the roads are, and thats just a small part.   I am just incredibly mindblown how Rockstar was able to pull this off....now I will be BEGGING for Red Dead even more!!!  just to give some facts for a few people maybe wondering, theres no mouse acceleration, the controls are seemless, controller support (if wierdly you want that) is seemlessly there. FOV is decently implemented (not perfect in FPS, but im sure mods will change that), it supports ultra widescreen (most cutscenes were made at 16:9 though). the First person functions perfectly. all controls are customizable. and based on low graphics settings, most peoples systems will probably run it well, and low settings still look pretty decent. oh and NO FRAME RATE CAP!

They made a WELL OPTIMIZED GAME! Which is VERY VERY RARE in todays gaming generation. That being said , the graphics are FREAKING AMAZING for this level of optimization. They made an amazing campaign , and havent priced it @ 99999999999999 bucks like Call of duty and BF franchise. Don't get me wrong , I am a hardcore BF Fan.  Best of all , they keep rolling out FREE ONLINE DLC's , contrary to other games where we have to buy base game for 60$ + Expansion pack @ 50$ *Cough Cough* EA *cough*.  Sure they did screw up online big time , and it could have been way better. I too have 2 minutes+ loading times, but the good thing is R* is working on it.

This'll be the next Skyrim if mods ever come out, I can't wait for those mods. Best game I've ever played in a really long time.   The Storyline of GTA V is awesome and hilarious at the same time. GTA Online is even better when you play with your friends, the downside of this is some players that are in the session, may just come and murder you for no reason. I was able to defend myself back so many times. But due to me just killing random Civilians and hunting down bounties, my Mental State, in statistics, considers me as a psychopath. But I think GTA Online is a better experience, unless it comes down making an archenemy. GTA Online is great when you rank up through missions and heists and people won't be able to mess with you if you're ranked high enough.  The game is inexplainable in general. In GTA Online, I just blow stuff up, 360 no-scope Players that tries to kill me, and make Los Santos my World. 11/10.",

FOV is decently implemented (not perfect in FPS, but im sure mods will change that), it supports ultra widescreen (most cutscenes were made at 16:9 though). the First person functions perfectly. all controls are customizable. and based on low graphics settings, most peoples systems will probably run it well, and low settings still look pretty decent. oh and NO FRAME RATE CAP!

            "review_text": "For me, Grand Theft Auto V’s extraordinary scope is summed up in two favourite moments. One is from a mid-game mission in which I flew a plane into another plane, fought the crew, hijacked the thing, and then parachuted out and watched it crash into the sea to escape death at the hands of incoming military fighter jets. Another time, whilst driving around in an off-road buggy, I got distracted by something that looked like a path up one of the San Andreas mountains. Turns out it was a path, and I spent 15 minutes following to the summit, where I nearly ran over a group of hikers. “Typical!” one of them yelled at me, as if he nearly gets run over by a rogue ATV on top of a mountain every time he goes on a hike.  I could go on like this for ages. GTA V has an abundance of such moments, big and small, that make San Andreas – the city of Los Santos and its surrounding areas – feel like a living world where anything can happen. It both gives you tremendous freedom to explore an astonishingly well-realised world and tells a story that’s gripping, thrilling, and darkly comic. It is a leap forward in narrative sophistication for the series, and there’s no mechanical element of the gameplay that hasn’t been improved over Grand Theft Auto IV. It’s immediately noticeable that the cover system is more reliable and the auto-aim less touchy. The cars handle less like their tires are made of butter and stick better to the road, though their exaggerated handling still leaves plenty of room for spectacular wipeouts. And at long last, Rockstar has finally slain one of its most persistent demons, mission checkpointing, ensuring that you never have to do a long, tedious drive six times when you repeatedly fail a mission ever again. Grand Theft Auto V is also an intelligent, wickedly comic, and bitingly relevant commentary on contemporary, post-economic crisis America. Everything about it drips satire: it rips into the Millennial generation, celebrities, the far right, the far left, the middle class, the media... Nothing is safe from Rockstar’s sharp tongue, including modern video games. One prominent supporting character spends most of his time in his room shouting sexual threats at people on a headset whilst playing a first-person shooter called Righteous Slaughter (“Rated PG – pretty much the same as the last game.”) It’s not exactly subtle – he literally has the word “Entitled” tattooed on his neck, and the in-game radio and TV’s outright ♥♥♥♥-takes don’t leave much to the imagination – but it is often extremely funny, and sometimes provocative with it. Grand Theft Auto’s San Andreas is a fantasy, but the things it satirises – greed, corruption, hypocrisy, the abuse of power – are all very real. If GTA IV was a targeted assassination of the American dream, GTA V takes aim at the modern American reality. The attention to detail that goes into making its world feel alive and believable is also what makes its satire so biting.  Grand Theft Auto V’s plot happily operates at the boundaries of plausibility, sending you out to ride dirt bikes along the top of trains, hijack military aircraft, and engage in absurd shootouts with scores of policemen, but its three main characters are what keep it relatable even at its most extreme. The well-written and acted interplay between them provides the biggest laughs and most affecting moments, and the way that their relationships with one another developed and my opinion of them changed throughout the story gave the narrative its power. They feel like people – albeit extraordinarily f***ed-up people.  Michael is a retired con man in his 40s, filling out around the middle as he drinks beside the pool in his Vinewood mansion with a layabout son, air-headed daughter, serially unfaithful wife, and very expensive therapist – all of whom hate him. Franklin is a young man from downtown Los Santos who laments the gang-banger stereotype even as he’s reluctantly seduced by the prospect of a bigger score. And then there’s Trevor, a volatile career criminal who lives in the desert selling drugs and murdering rednecks; a psychopath whose bloodthirsty lunacy is fuelled by a combination of methamphetamine and a seriously messed-up childhood. The missions flit between their individual stories and an overarching plotline that involves all three, and it’s a credit to GTA V’s versatility and universal quality that each character has his share of standout missions. As their arcs developed I felt very differently about each of them at different times – they’re not entirely the archetypes that they seem to be.  This three-character structure makes for excellent pacing and great variety in the storyline, but it also allows Rockstar to compartmentalise different aspects of Grand Theft Auto’s personality. In doing so, it sidesteps some of the troubling disconnect that arose when Niko Bellic abruptly alternated between anti-violent philosophising and sociopathic killing sprees in GTA IV. Here, many of Michael’s missions revolve around his family and his past, Franklin is usually on call for vehicular mayhem, and extreme murderous rampages are left to Trevor. Each has a special ability suited to his skills – Franklin can to slow time while driving, for example – which gives them a unique touch. Narratively, it’s effective – even off-mission I found myself playing in character, acting like a mid-life-crisis guy with anger issues as Michael, a thrill-seeker as Franklin, and a maniac as Trevor. The first thing I did when Franklin finally made some good money was buy him an awesome car, because I felt like that’s what he’d want.  Trevor feels a like a bit of a get-out-of-jail-free card for Rockstar, providing an outlet for all the preposterous antics and murderous behaviour that otherwise might not fit in with GTA V’s narrative ambitions. I found his violent insanity a little overblown and tiresome at first. As get-out clauses go, though, it’s pretty effective, and Trevor’s over-the-top missions are some of GTA V’s action-packed highlights. It’s a successful way of solving a problem that’s prevalent in open-world games: the tension between the story that the writers are trying to tell, and the story you create yourself within its systems and its world. Grand Theft Auto V accommodates both, masterfully, allowing neither to undermine the other. The actual act of switching between them also provides a window into their individual lives and habits, fleshing out their personalities in a way that feels natural and novel. Pick a character and the camera zooms out over the San Andreas map, closing back in on wherever they happen to be. Michael might be at home watching TV when you drop in on him, or speeding along the motorway blasting ‘80s hits, or having a cigarette at the golf club; Franklin might be walking out of a strip club, munching a bag of snacks at home, or arguing with his ex-girlfriend; there’s a good chance that Trevor could be passed out half naked on a beach surrounded by dead bodies or, on one memorable occasion, drunk in a stolen police helicopter.",

However for multiplayer, quite self explanatory, you do require friends who are willing to do what you want them to.  There are time where I want to just chill out in free roam and then there are those in which I like to make some serious cash. It just so happens that people who I play with do not necessarily agree with me at that particular moment.  As far as the game goes, apart from the stunning graphics (which I am not fully aware of considering my crap laptop), the small details are what makes it even more fun. Be it the animals (SP only) or the chair lift on top of that mountain. Oh boy. This review probably becomes redundant considering how old this game is but yeah, good to know is it not?  Edit: They ban you for reporting hackers and actually reset your hard earned cash to 0 regardless of whether or not you purchased shark cards or not, so beware! Don't report people I guess, lol. Suffer at their hands instead. That's the message Rockstar has given me atleast :D",

Both GTAV and GTAOL is fantastic, as I never have to worry about what I can do in Los Santos. However, for palyers who are in mainland China you have to suffer a lot, for: 1-distant servers located in Japan of American, and you will find yourself struggle to connect to Rockstar`s servers; 2-Terrible mechanism of anti-cheating, as I found many of my friends got banned for no reasons, ranging from a week to a month, while real cheaters or hackers were still in game; 3-aggressive gameplay for GATOL, as newbloods are often vulnerable to those experienced players, while the latter usually tends to be much more aggressive.  GTAOL features dozens of missions. However, most of them are actually the same, with the only difference being characters, locations, or what to steal, especially for hesist missions. I do hope there could be an update with several new missions which I could have fun with my friends  Anyway it`s still a good game.",

Voice acting, dialogues and characters are the best part in this game. Never skip the cutscenes, they are just amazing. Character development is good too. Going forward in the story reveals how ♥♥♥♥ed up certain people are and how far they are willing to go to survive. The plot itself is pretty standard, nothing to praise. I won't talk about the ending more than this: It's not bad, but it isn't the greatest of all time.  If you consider buying this game of Single Player, DO BUY this game. It's one of the most entertaining SP campaigns I have ever played.   Multiplayer: It's good. Nothing more than that. The more friends you have to play with, the better experience. As every beginner in MP, you will most probably have a rough start, but it will be smooth sailing once you get yourself some guns and money. Multiplayer has more cars than Single Player, but if you are looking for a nice Sports / Supercar, they will cost you huge amounts of money. You can get money from doing missions, winning races, survival and most money you get from heists. It will be a grind once you set your goal to $2,7 million, but if you don't mind the constant grind for money, you will like this game. You can own garages, apartments, cars, planes, helicopters, boats, (PARTY) yachts. You can also start a corporation and a motorcycle club. With these you can do more missions like delivering cocaine and transporting different deliveries for that extra money. Though you have to be loaded with cash to START these missions. You can join someone's Corp. or MC to do those missions and get money.  Problems with MP:  Hackers: Hackers might appear on your server dropping you money, killing you whenever you spawn or freeroaming in godmode (can't get hurt) and tearing places up. These hackers are not too common (at least in EU servers), but it might differ, if you live in US or Asia.  Toxic Community: The community of GTA V MP can sometimes be extremely painful to play with. Yelling in the mic, blaming, leaving mid-heist (which aborts the whole heist and throws you back to freeroam). Try to prevent this toxicity from spreading by being the good guy. There is a certain etiquette to being a nice bloke in Steam Guides for GTA V.  Loading Times: The amount of loading screens in Multiplayer is the biggest downer in the whole game. It ruins the flow of the game. Sometimes the first loading screen when going to Online might take 15 minutes to load. Even after that it might not find a server.  TL;DR Single Player: 10/10, buy it, if you have even the tiniest amount of interest in it. Multiplayer: 7/10, if you don't mind grinding missions and heists and also don't mind hackers and the longest loading screens, buy it. It's really fun to do heists with friends.  P.S. Don't be a busta!",

            "review_text": "I'm not gonna hate it too much nor I'm gonna love it too much. alright so where should we start? how about where the game starts, you and your friends are robbing a bank, michael gets shot, travor thinks he's dead and yada yada yada. now let's be honnest nobody, and i mean nobody cares about the stories in the GTA series, GTA is a game about gameplay, violance, gore and etc. so don't expect a really great story. so is this game worth the price? the single player and the multiplayer.  GAMEPLAY  -Now the gameplay, it's great, you have the controll to make the game first person or third person, which is based of the famous mod from GTA IV (the last game of the franchise). -Gun menue: you can open your gun wheel while game is on slow-motion which means it's slight more easier to choose your gun except in multiplayer you don't have the slow-motion,but the gun wheel menue is way easier then just pressing the 'next weapon' button to scroll between guns trying to find the one you want. -The Shooting Mechanics: controlling your sight is a lot easier in the new game, ESPECIALLY if you're using controller, it's just lot softer, not too slow or not too fast -Character's Special Abilities: now it's a little bit odd to have a character being able to slow time but it is a little helpful to the un-skilled new players. -Driving: not too many changes but the driving mechanic is great and all but shooting while driving is a really hard thing mostly in single player so i think rockstar should've added a aim assisstance while driving a vehicle. Realism: well GTA always was a game trying to simulate a criminal's life, it can even be called 'the crime simulator', so having realism will make the game much better and fun, but having characters changing their clothes between switches, is really annoying, like i put time to choose the clothes for example, trevor, and when i do a mission as franklin when i switch back to travor i see him in the deserts of Los Santos wearing a female dress, so i think they should fix that.  GRAPHICS  the graphics are great, whether if it's the PC version or the consoles, it's still great and it's enjoyable. so a TINK on that one cause you got it right.  CHARACTERS &amp; PERSONALITIES  the characters are interesting with interesting personalities, michael, a white retired thief who is trying to live a happy life, franklin, a slightly sterotypical african-american thug who is trying to make a few bucks for living, and trevor, a white mentally disordered bi-sexual who is insane and psychopathic and enjoys murder and causing chaos and violance, there's other characters but they're not worth your and my time, so far these 3 are different characters with different personalities to eachother and probably different from all of the other character in the trilogy (if the games take place in the same universe).  MULTI-PLAYER  Well at first it was a mess in console and every one f*cking hated it, after 3 years releasing the PC version had no problem... except one thing, the character you make sometimes appears with weird black lines on his body and his pants or legs, in order to fix this however is to download an Nvidia app (soonly will add its full name) that fixes the textures of games and you're good to go, but in general the multi-player is fun, especially if you're playing with your friends, though they're lots of D ouchies that kill you for no reason, but you can still have fun, there's more clothes for the characters then single player, you get to play as your own character, lots and lots of heist missions, cars, houses, side missions like PvP and etc. there's also this ranking up mechanic that each job you do or each store that you rob gives you RP (Rankup Points) and if you get the maximum mount of the RP of that level you level up to a new title like 'thug' or 'heister' and etc, each level you pass and new title you earn unlocks you new cars, new missions, new gun skins / modification and the guns themselve's, body armor, clothes and etc. making money in this multiplayer is a little bit hard and cheating will result in players getting banned, your best bet is rather keep playing till you make lots of cash or buy cards from the online stores for real money to give you GTA money. you cannot use the website on the your phone like single player, trading is only availible in Single-Player mode, and as a personal recemmendation, do not download 'cheat hacks' that some say it will give you infinite money or whatever in the game, those are most virus or other programs, they are mostly trolls, if there is any real program that will hack the game rockstar removes it, such as they did to videos in youtube that teached how to use glitches to earn money, so if you find a video claiming it's a real hack don't download, or do incase you don't care if it's virus and you really want to try it bad. you do you.  Finally, it's time to give this game a score, it was a great game, good gameplay but they released the game too late for the PC version, when they announced GTA 6, which is why i give this game 9/10 and a BADASS badge seal of a proval, rockstar i gotta tell you, you did a great job at this, and i say it's worth your money, and i hope they add new dlc for like more clothing, more cars, more guns and haircuts and all that, so rockstar don't let the game just die, and keep it up with some good old DLC. thanks to you who read this, and i hope you like the game too.

You understand where everyone is coming from. Franklin wants to grow up and make more money. Micheal just wants to have a nice retirement. Trevor is just crazy. You like everyone (except micheal, because he lied to trevor, and is an ♥♥♥ to his family) Its really great stuff   The music and graphics are on point. The graphics are just fantastic. This game looks incredible, even better then the consoles because you can run this game at a higher frame rate. It is very demanding, but you can still play it on a low end card. This game also has so much veriaty in music its stupid. You got your rock, your pop, rap, electronic, latino, you got everything except jazz, classical, ect. Gta 6 must include jazz or classical or else im downvoting it.   Also the Driving in this game is very good, almost to the point where you can call it a racer. Its a really good alternative to those racing games where it costs 60$ and all you do is race and nothing else. Terrible value.    Online is so dence with activities that it almost feels like another game. Playing it for long enoght and recieving money in the millions, you start feeling like a badass that wont take crap from others. You got your tank, attack heli, personal company, minigun, and just everything to make you feel like you own everything. Of course theres hackers, but those are rare, and that is why the exit botton was invented right?   Tl:DR Gta 5 is everything you can ask for. Its a racing game, exploration game, shooting game, story driven game, a yoga game. It has so much to say about our world today its almost a parody. and it is one of my favorite games. 10/10",

I mean... it is the same game. but it feels and plays much better.  I max out the game and rarely get below 60 fps. if I ever do i get like 55 fps... not a big deal. So Rockstar did a great job porting the game.   It seems people are having issues logging in to the social club. I never had that problem. My friend did though. His steam name had a dot at the end (name.). Once he removed that dot he was able to log in. It has something to do with the social club not working with certain symbols.   The game: The story is crazy and filled with even crazier people. The longer you get through the game the more fun it becomes. I love the characters though I think rockstar did a much better job in Red Dead Redemption when it comes to personalities.   The world is filled with stuff to do so you will never be bored. If you somehow get bored there's always the multiplayer. I've not tried it yet on pc... but I can say the console version had a ton of variety in community made maps and game modes. I am sure the creativity of the pc gamers will outdo what has already been done.",

I must say its fairly clever how they give you a shark card so you cant get a refund... wrong I know but still not a bad idea in terms if marketing.

Make it your's or sell it for some cold hard cash and play the entire game on foot. Rob a store. Team up with other players and rob a bank. Do missions for shady NPCs. The choice is yours, as long as the choice is morally wrong. It's a wide open sandbox for criminal wannabes of all types.   If there's one thing I'm disappointed at, is that there's no internet criminal path. You're stuck with physical crimes like theft, street racing and heists. There's no way to do online scams, or just hack NPCs to steal from their bank accounts. I suppose R* doesn't want to cross over to Ubisoft's and Introversion Software's turf (and I suppose the game is called Grand Theft Auto for a reason), but it would be nice to be able to commit anonymous crimes aside from physical ones.  EDIT: I've been just been made aware about hackers and R*'s hijinks at punishing the wrong party- I'll just relay a piece of advice I got on a friend: create a private crew or private friend session, so only you and your friends will be in the entire session and no one else. Of course, therein lies the minor rub: you can only create or join private sessions by logging into Story Mode first, not directly from the main menu. R* would do good to offer a submenu to choose a session type (join public session, create/join private friend/crew session, and create/join invite-only session) when the Online option is chosen in the main menu instead of just dumping people into a public session. Also, I can see this being a problem to those who don't know any friends who play GTA:O, but it's not like you can't enjoy the world solo- in fact, a large number of tasks in the world can be played solo.",

I've played for 50+ hours and have updated drivers and waited for game updates but neither have helped. The game always crashes due to one of two things: either a 'failed initialization' or I need to sign into social club again. This problem is not occasional either, it seems to be able to happen anywhere from game startup to at most three hours of gameplay before I have to make multiple attempts to counter the problem.   However, this does not ruin the game for me, since this is simply a bug that can be fixed. The storyline is fun and being able to switch characters adds to the experience. Each have their own 'perks' that make them fun to use. My favorite is Trevor because of how similar he is to a friend of mine. The speech that Michael gives to him shortly after you meet Trevor makes the game for me. The vastness and diversity bring it to a new level of open world gaming. Yes, much like the other games, the cars are all very different depending on the region you are in and some can be found customized already. But what impresses me is that no two NPCs in the world are alike as long as your PC has the specs for this setting. I don't care too much for the first person view, something doesn't seem right about it but there are the occasional times where I enjoy it.  I would definitely recommend this game to anyone, it is plenty of fun and can easily keep you entertained just like many of the previous GTA's. I only hope that the problem with the game crashing gets worked out.

I have played Gta Online on the consoles and as long as you got friends to screw around with, this is where the most fun is to be had with so many things to do like Heists, Racing, Deathmatches, and just free roaming, and so on.

If you want Gta 5 for its Online, then get this game on consoles to avoid most hackers and being banned.",

Oh, so you want to quit the game because someone is doing that? YOU CAN'T! Why not? Because menus dissapear EVERY, SINGLE TIME YOU ARE IN A DEATH SCREEN, which if your being spam spawn killed, is not avoidable. 'gu entu pasiv mode' you say? That is also a menu, so you can't.  If the cheater manages to stuff his sweaty face with cheetos and you get the chance to actually quit the game, you are presented with yes; another loading screen. Which will either result in you being killed, or, if you actually were able to click the option to quit, you get hear yourself die again juuusst for that little extra spark to make sure you really rage. And the game takes ages to close. AGES.  So the only relaible way to actually quit the game is to press the reset button on your computer.

I realize some people are having technical issues, and I understand that can be very frustrating, but trust me when I say it's worth it. These are probably some of the nicest lighting effects I've seen in a game. I have every setting maxed out, except for MSAA, TXAA, and the High Detail Shadows. My VRAM is my bottleneck unfortunately, so adding any of those options puts me into the 30-40FPS region. I am running the game at 1440p so this is a pretty demanding setup. In the city I'm sitting in the 60-80FPS region and in the country areas it's 40-50FPS or so. I do notice that when driving very fast across the map I hit moments of 30FPS, and I'm not sure if this is because of the game loading the next section of the map or if it's because my settings are too high (there's a TON of vegetation in the country areas) so one way or the other I'll even out some settings to get 60+FPS constant if possible.  As for the story and gameplay, it's GTA. I played through the entire game on the XB360 version so I have less motivation to play the main story currently, but I assume it's basically just the same, and the main story was awesome on XB360 so I can't see why it wouldn't be just as good here. One thing I really noticed is that the cutscenes are actually enjoyable to watch now. The console cutscenes ran so slow and choppy it was hard to even pay attention to the story, but so long as your settings are done correctly they will run at a nice 60hz+ and it becomes much easier to get sucked into the story.  Just understand what you're buying. It's still GTA, just like the console version, but with a lot of great new visuals and online features. If you're looking for a game to really tax your system this is it!",

The FPS mode adds a great new perspective that works perfectly with keyboard and mouse, but have a controller ready for driving.  For me this game works a treat. I have played the 360 version and this is deffinatly just as fun. The use of first person mode makes the game epic. Gun fights are better and more seamless with the ability to aim now a thing. I personalynuse a 360 controller and keyboard and mouse somi get the best of both worlds and i would recomend this.   I'm using a nvidia 970 and the game is on near full graphics and well my fps is somewhere between 25-45 fps which would imply the game has a little work to do in regards to graphical bugs. Yes it looks tones better than 360 but not that much better, i dread to see what 4k monitors look like in regards to full graphics. So i hope an update comes out to improve this. Either way the game looks good and super high quality shaddows are not hugely necessary, and turning them down a little improves the frame rate alot.  For those who have been having issues loading, that gota suck and there is little i can say about that but it works well for me first time so I have to highly recomend this game and while it is technicaly a port its a fairly good one and think its worth all the money.",

I found the game fun, but I was a heavy PC gamer and the graphics/performance was not up to par for me at all (which I expected of course, but I was desperate for the game). I made a few friends I would play with just about daily, weekly, then I just quit because it just didn't quite do it for me. That is until now.  The PC version of the game has finally released and honestly, this release has impressed me greatly. I had absolutely no problems joining the singleplayer then the multiplayer and finally transferring my character which was flawless. I managed to encounter just one error which prevented me from joining multiplayer games with people, but that was due to me network software (special to my mobo) had the priority of the game too high, once I lowered it I was golden (had this same issue with ARMA 3 where server list wouldn't load and cause game to freeze when attempting to load it).  Now how does the game feel? It feel quite good, it does have the slight input delay that we've experienced before with the last GTA IV, but not nearly as bad and it actually works pretty well. The performance of the game is pretty well, I am sure it will improve over time with some patches, but it is very well playable. I am getting around 80-95fps on a mix of high/very high settings. The flying controls are not the greatest, but they will do for now, need to try reconfiguring the keybindings and see if I can't make it better or now (default uses combination of 'asdw' keys and your '4865' keypad keys, not really ideal for me but it works.  In closing, this is what I have been waiting for. They did a lot of great work on the PC version of this game, and I have no problem recommending it to people.",

I decide to have some fun with him and blow his tank up with an attack chopper. He respawns, reorders his tank, and continues his carnage campaign. I blow him up AGAIN just for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles. What follows is a not-so-intense battle between the two of us across the entire map (The server only has 2 other people in it). I kill him a few times, he kills me some, the score is pretty even. Eventually I get bored of it and run off to do something else, thinking he'll be done with it.  He catches up to me and snipes me. Respawn and he does it again...... and again... and again...  I got tired of it and turned on passive mode. This guy, a level 80, who thinks he's 'defeated' me in some way, scolds me by saying this and I quote: 'Don't ♥♥♥♥ with people you can't handle, that should teach you.' WELL I had no idea I was supposed to be taking notes!  I, a level 55 at the time, ♥♥♥♥ed around with a level 80 in his tank, who consequently tried to make an example of me and my shenanigans to the other two people in the server who didn't give a ♥♥♥♥.     The community is an abysmal melting pot of narcissists and hackers, so bring a friend.",

So snatch it up while it's on sale you would be crazy not and if your planning to play online a ton which i imagine you would , the bonus $500k to get you started and buy some property cars clothes and so on is a win win .Oh and when you have the graphics all on the lowest settings it still looks awesome.  So if you read my 'review' i salute and bow to you . So i'll bid you farewell and enjoy the game if you got it :)  P.S I'v played every GTAand still San Andreas is my fave and this is in my top 5 , i wrote to much on my 1st review and i go on a rant while typing and if you wana see a funny story of the origin of my computer ill write it on my profile if i can :)",

            "review_text": "Singleplayer: It's good, I haven't completed it yet but I'm enjoying it in small amounts.  Online: Loving it. There are ridiculous amounts of game modes available (although you will need to make friends who want to play these-public lobbies are impossible to fill for most of the side games). There is 'slasher' which is similar to Dead by Daylight. There is a mode where you have cars on top of platforms which you must ram eachother off. There's huge variety of deathmatch, vehicle deathmatch (tanks), aireal combats, capture modes, protect/transport modes. These all give you in game currency which can be used to purachase cars or weapon upgrades.  The main free-roam is rather hard to say what the 'normal' state is. Some sessions everyone is running around killing and griefing eachother (there is a passive mode if you want to just drive and not attack others), some game sessions you will find people are peaceful and just want to complete CEO work to make more profits.  There is also heists which although being limited to 5 storylines are replayable and enjoyable although on your 10th time they can be a bit grindy, although they pay good profits so it's worth doing it if you want to buy your next super car.  You can buy yachts, fighter planes, business jets, motorcycles. The landscape is great to explore and just ride motorcycles around the deserts/hills. You can even go mountain biking.  Here are the bad points: The game doesn't have servers as such. It is peer 2 peer based so that if you have a slower connection or fussy router then you might experience some de-sync 'lag' issues. Example: Sitting in my friends car when they drive fast there is often a bit of teleporting/jumping happening, or it can appear that the car is standing still and then seconds later it will arrive at the destination. These problems aren't game breaking as during combat they normally fade away, and on foot it doesn't occur much at all. The other problem of P2P game is that it makes it easy to hack and cheat it seems.   There is also a lot of young players, I would say between 10-15yo. And the in game voice chat gets rather annoying-I switched it off and use discord with friends anyway.  The grind to get new cars is not too difficult. If you have a CEO job then you can make 2 million profit from warehouse in maybe 4hours of gameplay (being generous). Quicker if you have friends helping.  They are adding new DLC all the time, recently was some crazy over the top racing (normally racing exists also).  The driving in races is not simulator like but not totally arcade, to get around a track fast you need to steer accurately and brake in corners at the correct speed.  Definitely recommend this and would say it has a good 2 years left of DLC updates and support from R*.",

Other than that, Grand Theft Auto V has made me satisfied with it being on PC. I really don't have any other words than 'satisfied' to say. Although, the game does have certain issues with performance. My MSi NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970 4GB GPU can't handle the grass on Ultra. It becomes much worst when you try to add AA to it. FXAA+MSAA 4x will just lag my game down to 45-50 fps depending on the area of the map you are in (this mostly happens when driving around certain parts of the city, but is heavily shown in the grassy areas such as the forest). The only solution I've come around to is to set your AA settings to 2x MSAA+NVIDIA TXAA. It will help a lot with performance and will cap your frames per second to 60 fps (of course, this also depends on your GPU, but it works for me). This is basically my only down side to the game is the grass issue. It's a good console port.   Nothing else 10/10 would play again.",

Online seemed like a silly tacked on experience that really wasn't needed in the GTA franchise. Their strength in these games was always what you did with the main character. I won't talk much about the online since it really relies on who you play with there.  Three main characters. Seems like a strange concept but the writing (as far as how their stories relate to each other) makes for a compelling game. My only problem with them is Franklin. There is a lot of back story with him, but unlike the other two his past rarely shows up during the game. It feels like we came in just after the interesting experiences he has had. I think this game would have benefited greatly if Lamar was swapped with him as a playable character. Trevor, having the personality of the Joker, is hard to relate to sometimes. However there are some great moments where in the middle of a ridiculous situation he is the calm rational person. Michael definitely shows for having the most work done on his character. He's not only the catalyst for the over-arching story, but is also the one that seems to have the most to loose as he juggles a buried past and a dysfunctional family.  After completing the story missions and everything else that pops up on the map, I found myself going online and looking for the whereabouts of everything needed for the 100% completion. I never do this for most games. Usually I'll just finish the story and move on. Along the way I still discovered events that were all different from each other and still had fun occasionally jumping off high places or starting a police chase with a tank. The game has actually told me that I'm done. The credits rolled (and holy ♥♥♥♥ they were long). I did the small epilogue parts after. I've even had each character spend time with one another and listen to them pretty much work out their past differences or just congratulate the others on how they've handled themselves. But it still feels like there's more in that game to do. Maybe I'll just go jump on a bike and head up north for some hunting. Or there's still that UFO that I'd actually like to see.",

This game offers a lot of content in two different ways: Singleplayer and Online.  Singleplayer is playable for 50 hours, but with mods you can spend another 50 hours. The story and cool, but lets face it: dickin' around is MUCH more fun. Cheat codes, trainer mods and all is the best part of singleplayer.  Now, for the online: you start by creating your character by selecting your parents. A very cool method. You get a car and you do the introduction and all of this and that. Freemode is a 30 players lobby and is awesome for all of you thrill seekers, or chill-dudes. You can buy a whole arsanal of weapons, hundreds of vehicles (including a TANK, Attack choppers, boats, armored cars etc.) and modify most of them in the local Los Santos Customs. You have a large selection of vehicles mod, but if you wanna go hardcore go to Benny's Originals, where you can blow your IRL college funds on GTA$ to pimp out a lowrider. Btw, If we are talking about blowing your college funds, you can also buy a YACHT and customize its livery, lights, flag and all. mine costs 10,000,000 $.  The Online offers a lot of missions and Heists. Those will fill up your pockets with greens if you dont want to pay real life money (I grind missions every time I play and do 200K-400K in 4-6 hours of gameplay). The missions are 10-20 minutes of action that includes a LOT of bullets flying your way, crazy getaways and in the end, some money in your pockets. Some missions require one player at least, and some require 4 players. I'd recommend playing with one or two friends at least. The Heists require 4 players. The Heists are done by doing the setups (usually 5) and in the end the heist itself.  Lets talk more about freemode. Did I mention there is a mast shop on the beach with over 100 masks? No, I havn't. Also, there are couple of hundreds of cloths waiting for you in the clothing shops. any player can choose up to 5 properties from a large selection and these include Garages, Houses and Apartments. some of the apartments can be customized. Ok, so if you like action all the time, the freemode offers the Freemode Events, which are missions without loading time with high payouts.  I can talk about this game for another 20 minutes but I gotta go so Im gonna stop after this last paragraph.  This game is AMAZING. If you got the time for it just buy it and enjoy. Don't let anything stop you.  carlitos, AWAY!!!!!!",

I played the console version for a couple of years and I can testify that there is enough new content on the PC version which justifies purchasing it even though you already finished it on the Playstation or Xbox. I got it on sale and I believe that is the price it should be regularly. Also don't worry about being banned for using mods on your SINGLE player account. Rockstar released a statement they are not banning people who mod the single player account but only people who alter the online portion of the game, which is a great thing. Anyway, buy it and enjoy it. If anyone is wondering, I didn't have to buy any shark cards during the sale (Winter Sale of December 2015 - January 2016). Game was $42 CAD.",

I personally use a controller for flying and keyboard and mouse for everything else. The game as a whole seems so smooth, driving especially.   Cons: You have to start nitpicking in order to find something about this game that isn't up to par. The obvious for me was the excessive time spent on loading screens. Finding a GTA Online game is a pain since loading screens can sometimes take up a substancial chunk of time. Joining jobs and heists also have the loading screens.   In the end, I couldn't recommend this game enough. The game itself is among the funnest I've ever played with the graphical improvements over the console version making it even better!",

Well, it's finally here. The ultimate edition of GTA 5. 60 FPS, 1080p, and upgraded graphics. This game truly looks incredible. One fear many people had about this version of GTA was whether or not the port was going to be of Max Payne 3 quality or GTA 4 quality. Thankfully it appears to have landed on the Max Payne 3 side of Rockstar quality. There is a lot of hate for GTA, because of the open ended nature of the game. Many do not enjoy the story, or would rather just cause havok in Los Santos. Causing havok is plenty of fun, but can get stale after a while which is why I love the story so much. The story is overflowing with personality, odd characters, likable characters and downright scumbags. There is plenty of variety to keep the story moving and it stays fresh right to the very end.   I haven't touched the online yet, but from what I've read it is overall enjoyable and should keep the life of GTA going for a few years. I just need to find out whether Rockstar will allow modding for GTA 5 or not. That will truely determine if GTA 5 is going to have a long lifespan or eventually fade out from people's libraries.",

This game has been out for a couple years now and having played it on the Xbox 360, the Xbox One, and PC, putting over 50 days in the online component alone, this is the best game I've ever played. I feel confident saying so as this game is the best $60 dollars I've ever spent. Or I suppose $120(ish), (I own it from a license transfer on the Xbox One). Open world games are my favorite types of games and this game is a masterpiece on so many levels for the genre. The world of Los Santos is an incredible representation of the United States' west coast; so much in fact it is scary. That alone is a story for another day but, its sprawling metropolis and scorching deserts are so lifelike it's incredible. Rpckstar put so much effort into detail I find myself disccovering more throughout my playtime each day I play.    Rockstar continues to update Grand Theft Auto V Online almost every single month. Adding in new game modes, vehicles, weapons, clothing, and features. Some complain as the content is 'miniscule' complaining we need to see more hiests. When, sure I'm not arguing against bigger and better conent; but you cannot complain for how much has been given already. Seriously almost every feature I've dreamed of coming to Grand Theft Auto V Online nearly literally has. Between chilling on a yacht, cliffdiving, going to car shows, getting in police chases, drift competitions, drag racing, demo derbies, flying, diving, etc. This game never gets boring. At least not if you make it fun. There is so much to do in GTA V if you lose interest it is your own doing for not being creative enough to try something new. Because; in GTA V there always will be.   If you haven't bought it yet, get it now. seriously. This game as of 3/23/2016 is a 10/10 masterpiece, of writing, design, and most importantly gameplay. I could go on for hours telling you why between all the memories I've created in this game. ",

            "review_text": "Saw people complaining SA (or GTA4,VC even 3) is the best one, and GTA5 is boring. Well I didn't believe in that because old gamers tend to be nostalgic. We see FFVI fans bashing FFVII, or Oblivion fans bashing Skyrim in many places, no big deal. To me GTA5 is still the GTA I know, same formula, more or less same feeling, still a fairly decent game and definitely worth its price. It improved a lot from GTA4, except the plot. The plot is destroying the game for me.  Warning: Spoilers and personal feelings(rant) ahead  When I finished GTA4, the feeling of emptiness was so overwhelming that I had the thought that game will be the top of GTA in terms of plot for a long time. Nothing beats the message they sent in GTA4 . No matter how badass you look, as long as you stay in a wrong path, you are leading yourself and those who you love into destruction. Nico learned that in the end, so did many of us. R* raised the game to a new level in GTA4. Lets us enjoy being a criminal without real life consequences for 80% of the time, then slaps us hard in the face. Feels like my COD transformed into This War of Mine. Brilliant.  So how would they get to a new level? Well, they surely came up with some revolutionary methods. In GTA5 you get to play the psychopath. Not just an ordinary criminal but a completely crazy man. Like those in Fallout series which you kill by hundreds with all kinds of ways, or role play to be one of them. Unfortunately in GTA you don't get that much 'character control'. The psychopath naturally decides to roam free, and you have to watch until the end. You will see that one guy kills people for tiny issues, threatens his long time partners, forces one of his partner's relatives to work for him, uses the place he live as base of operation and eventually kills the owner when asked to leave, etc. Not to mention he had more f**ked up history even before the game such as bring people to cannibals for cash. Like Michael says, there has to be limits. In the end, Michael's bottomline is human stew. Mine were crossed for many times in the middle, so the only thing keeps me playing is I want to see when this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ die. I rushed the second half of the game until I righteously slaughtered that motherf**ker and made him EXTRA CRISPY. Even though I could almost smell victory in the end, I didn't feel much fun during rushing. Obviously not a good gaming experience. (An extra line for role playing fanboys: He wants revenge for me calling him that? Fine, tell him to come and face FOXHOUND.)  Sure, I can't play as him anymore, and lose all the properties on his part. Still I have no regrets. People claim ending C is the best, to me, it is cheap and ends at the place where main characters barely have any development. It is an easy way out to forcefully cut the loose ends altogether and gives a 'happy ending' for the casuals. It might satisfy those who just enjoy killing things, but plot wise it is terrible and I will thumb down if that is the only ending.  I still have to thank R* for letting me realize I am 'too old' for this. Back when SA was out, CJ sealing an unfortunate guy in cement is out of bounds for many of us. Now fanboys are completely OK with psychopath doing things in a more brutal level, because 'badass' and 'loyal to those who are truly close'. What a BS. Everyone care those in his/her inner circle. These people would praise someone 'cares people he cares' as if it is a virtue. (Surprise! Terrible person with one thing normal is loveable.) Meanwhile they call people who choose to kill that guy heartless. Makes me laugh at their logic. Looks like the average level of gamers dropped quite a bit, now we have those people who are almost similar to how R* portrayed Jimmy. I probably will quit mainstream Triple A money printer games for good soon. Just to keep myself away from this stupidity.  TL;DR Was 10/10, psychopath makes it 6/10 for me. If you don't care it should still be 10/10 for you, so I thumb up.",

            "review_text": "GTA has been a favorite series of mine since the first game. In those days, it was very convenient for party play-- pop in some cheats and hand off to the next person when you died. Nobody did the missions except if you were the only one playing. This trend continued on into 2 and 3, where multiplayer either did not exist (or on PC, couldn't get it to work easily) or didn't matter. The real first experience with multiplayer I had was Multi Theft Auto for Vice City. From that moment on, the dream of multiplayer GTA meant stupid, impossible feats. San Andreas reached that peak in singleplayer but lacked multiplayer beyond co-op (sad). GTA has many capacities: for GTA V, you have to take the game as two seperate parts delineated on borders of functionality.   GTA Online is to a lesser degree, an excellent game; however, the reason one would play GTA Online is because singleplayer, after finishing the story, becomes a dull, boring affair with little of the emergent content present in GTAO. That emergent content, however, is dull, too, once you've become accustomed to it. If you have imagination, GTA (any GTA) can be enjoyable.  I will discuss both GTAO and GTA V in each facet to help you determine whether this game is a heap of dog crap or a brilliant, postmodern mockery of sandbox games. First of all, GTAO has microtransactions, and it is stupid. It goes against everything imaginable for a decent company like Rockstar to engage in this nonsense-- microtransactions are a nuisance and a micro-economy of fake money injected into games using your real money. It is unscrupulous and unethical, and I think this personally, that it is a great, albeit evil, business model. GTAO might be preying on stupid, casual, or lazy players who suck at GTA, are 12 and have mom's credit card, or weary, married-too-young males who work a lot and just buy their way to success in P2W games. Still, endorsing a Dave and Buster's style microeconomy of optional pay walls to content is tantamount to encouraging it, even if you plan to gain marginal sales on their Shark Cards (they made a lot of money, actually).  GTAO and singelplayer suffer from the same gameplay issues that every GTA eventually runs into; GTAO makes up for lack of minigames and activities by always adding more content over time. As of yet, singleplayer is dead due to no new content injection. A major change to the gameplay is the quality of graphics and the new viewpoint. The first-person view adds immense icing on the cake of new graphical fidelity which puts the game far ahead of any competitor. Even when textures look like runny jpeg slosh, the after-effects and great breadth of options mean that even without texture modding, the game will look fine for quite a while. GTA IV is still getting new leases on life because both games leave a lot of room for personal taste for modders to eventually exploit and manipulate to get more intensive graphics (yet to be seen, but the game just came out).   The lowest generation versions (PS3 and 360) were quite bad looking, washy textures and terrible aliasing abounding, but the games still had excellent, visionary quality for that generation's horribly gimped graphical power. It's quite an achievement that even on low settings, the game is functional-- functional is the least I can say for games, since the last big sandbox games I played a lot, Black Flag and Watchdogs, were pretty... pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. They were functional messes at their best, and glitchy, contorted eppileptic siezures at worst. GTA V on PC still has glitches (though I have had few pop-in issues) and crashing, but it's far more stable than many multi-console port/mish-mash games I've been uncomfortable playing.  A major issue I have with these games, that is GTA V's various versions, is that as updates and content have been implemented, there is a major difference between singleplayer and multiplayer driving/handling configurations. Cars go slow or faster depending on the patch, and there's awful discrepencies even in Online alone between the lag you experience: when I do normal missions in full servers on this PC version, I rarely experience floating cars and pop-in. Now, in every Heist-related mission, there is lag, pop-in, invisible cars, and fgloating cars dropping in on me. Consistent with PS3 (my previous generation version), Rockstar expends a lot of energy issuing small one-day patches that clear up exploits and glitches-- but not ones that functionally break the game! No! They focus on exploits and hacking related to people griefing or making money (taking away from their Shark Card revenue) or duplicating cars.   This goes hand-in-hand with contentious, still, approaches to 'bad sports.' I have never even been fully on bad sport lobbies, but I hate that you cannot avoid it. Accidental car destructiuon happens constantly. GTA IV had many of the greater qualities that made fan-created multiplayer (especially SAMP) so much fun: in other words, we need to stop having draconian rules about personal-vehicles. Implement a server list so people can implement rules like 'no cops' or 'no personal vehicle insurance claims.' Being able to ban or give tanks to players outside of missions would be a plus; more control of the lobby-like free mode would make this game immensely better! GTA IV multiplayer was enjoyable, yet I do not want to give up new ideas like persitant weapons or personal vehicles, but insurance and whatnot is so superfluous and pointless that I cannot stand it. I get it, Rockstar! Sticky bombing peoples cars in a game about robbery and murder is a bully behavior (from the guys who made a great game called BULLY).   The soundtrack is excellent-- though, a lot of wierdness comes from the ambient soundtrack. I just wish there was a seperate soundbar for just THAT ambient music. The roster of artists is very good, varied, large. One feature I wish would one day be added is updates with new music after launch... a pipedream, I know, but GTAO is being built on a longterm profit and update model. As for the sound effects, they are superb. The game has a quality more like GTA IV, where I don't hear a lot of the sam pedestrian dialogue, but it also falls in line with an overly serious tone the game takes (no quotable dumb pedestrian lines).  As for story- and this is my final topic- I can only be brief. There's many elements to the characterizations and the cast that makes the game a compelling GAME, and not some cinematic experience. There are definitely moments where it goes over into that territory but often this is temporary and is pointed out. We are not given characters that fall down under examination or have no criticism from the world beyond police and an antagonist. There is self-deprecation and there is deprecation from these characters' families and friends. As for the preachy, left-wing/right-wing saoccer mom/social justice warrior critiques of this game's treatment of LGBT topics: this game is incredibly fair and kind to everyone involved. Major themes critique the protaganists, their society, and the enemies that motivate the main characters. You're going to feel sorry for things you do. I don't know how this is any less a story about reluctant criminals than the previous: in 3, it's forced revenge to deal with a romantic betrayal. In Vice City, it's forced independence to escape your betrayers. In San Andreas, it's forced everything by everyone, often because of their crimes and weakness. GTA IV was about an immigrant dealing with America, forced to flee his past. Now we have three protaganists fitting these previous games (Franklin and CJ, Michael and Vercetti, Trevor and Claude).  In closing, I give it a number out of a number.  GTA is still hectic, even if you don't like the HD era. It's a ♥♥♥♥ing parody of its own meaningless, plagiarized movie plots. Online is fine and good, even when it disappoints... you'll still play it. And where's the co-op R*??? WHERE?!",

Rockstar has fallen short on PC ports everytime, ESPECIALLY with GTA IV. However, this time around is a different story. Rockstar developed this game partially in parallel with the console versions rather than sloppily porting the game from the console version over to PC. They did a phenomonal job.  PERFORMANCE: I have a GTX 970, i5 4690k, and 16gb's of RAM. I am able to max basically all graphical options while achieving a solid 60fps. This excludes high res shadows, extended distance detailing, and whatever else is included in the Advanced Graphics page. These options eat up performance for little value in return. If you have a lower end system that meets minimum specs, you will have no trouble running this game as long as you do not mind turning some settings down.  THINGS TO NOTE: - The PC version seamlessly integrates Gamepad play, so you can use your keyboad for shooting and your controller for driving and find no issues switching over while you play.  - You can add your own music to a custom radio station which is traditional for PC versions of GTA. I'm glad they carried this over! However, many people are running into performance issues such as texture pop-ins and major framerate decreases when listening to the custom station deemed 'Self Radio'. I have not ran into any of these issues.  All in all, this is, with no contest, the definitive version of Grand Theft Auto V.",

Cons: -As stated before, online mode is absolutely full of hackers. 1 in every 2 full lobbies will have atleast 1 hacker. It seems like instead of preventing hackers, R* is just banning anyone they find modding, even if you do it in single player. the game could really use a good cheat prevention system. -R* uses greedy buisness practices with this game.

No other world in video games comes close to this in size or scope, and there is sharp intelligence behind its sense of humour and gift for mayhem. It tells a compelling, unpredictable, and provocative story without ever letting it get in the way of your own self-directed adventures through San Andreas.  It is one of the very best video games ever made.  Grand Theft Auto 5 is a masterpiece of a game, and the PC version is the best way to experience it. Its sprawling yet meticulously detailed map is the high bar to which all other open-world games aspire, and it’s incredibly dense with excellent content. With so much to do, explore, and play with, both in single-player and multiplayer, plus great creative tools, it’s truly amazing on multiple levels.",

I bought GTA V on Launch Day back in September of 2013 for the Xbox 360 the Xbox 360 version did justify the $60 and Rockstar is slowly ending support for the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 versions of the game. I've played the Playstation 4 'Next-gen' version of GTA V and I was quite impressed by the updated visuals and more pedestrians and traffic. I found it to be better then GTA V for the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 due to the fact that the 'Next-gen' version looked better and ran better then the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 could ever run the game. I'll admit, GTA V was a ground breaking game graphics-wise on the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 but it's time to let those go. I recently bought GTA V for PC and I'm going to say that the PC version of GTA V is the definitive version of this game and it beats the Xbox 360, Playstation 3, Xbox One, and Playstation 4 versions of this game. The PC version looks better and sharper then the Xbox One and Playstation 4 version of this game and it responds better then the Xbox One and Playstation 4 version of this game. I will say that hackers are a big problem in GTA Online at the moment but I'm sure and I hope that Rockstar has something up their sleeve to stop hackers from ruining other people fun. For the $60 (or if you get it on sale) it is worth it just be careful around hackers! I'd rate the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 version of this game a 6/10, Xbox One and Playstation 4 version of this game a 7.5/10, and the PC version of this game a 8.5/10.",

The level of immersion you can get in this game is excellent. Want to play tennis? Sure, they got that. Want to race cool cars? They got that too. What about guns, drugs and killing strangers, of course!   Now the biggest drawback for online is the money. Everything is terribly expensive and it's very difficult to come by money. Not impossible, just slow and tedious. I believe they make it this way so that you'll buy money with real USD, but that's pretty much status quo of the gaming industry nowadays.   The bottom line: If you want a game with a hell of a lot to do, looks great, plays swimmingly and is an overall joy to have this is the game for you.

The only thing i dont like about gta online is that everything new that gets added in always costs a lot of money, but once you buy a CEO business you are able to make money easily. This game has one of the best story modes ive played in a game, most fun, replayable online modes, every DLC is free and rockstar update the game regularly. With around 600 hours on xbox 360, and currently 350 hours on steam, i can safely say that Gta V is worth every dollar you spend on it. Thank you rockstar, for creating one of my most favortie games of all time, i cant recommend this game enough, if you are even considering buying this, do it, you wont be dissapointed.",

Anyways, back to the review, so this game is the most realistic game in my library and you actually get wet when you go in water, sadly you don't shake like a wet dog to get the water off though, damn... Oh yeah, you can buy a machine called the 'HVY Insurgent' and it's a monster, honestly it's more powerful than a truck! I once tipped a truck over with it and almost blew it up. It also takes 7-10 explosives to blow up, I drove into a petrol station once and there wasn't a scratch on it. Then you have the strip club! (You really don't want to go in the back room for a private dance... Trust me, I've done it. Twice! It's so awful YouTube won't even let you show it, y-you get the idea, right?) Hmm... What am I missing? The Heists! They're so fun to do although level 1 people can join and you have to kick them from the waiting list since they're new they'll also struggle. I'm currently level 61 and I don't deserve to be it because all I do is mess in free roam, I rarely do Heists for some reason even though I enjoy them and get money. The Heist final gives everyone 250,000 and if you are the host you can set your money to 25% and you'll get 500,000! I've never seen a hacker in my 228 hours of play time. End of the review I can't think right now.  C'ya people of the World! ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) -A Mysterious Seal June 4th 2016",

I've made 3 friends in two days, one of which is a 100% Russian speaker and I don't understand him but we play well together. Lots of Russian people in this game actually.  The problems arise only when people are rude. I've been blown up or killed numerous times by people who have better guns, planes, missiles, whatever. I've heard the screaming cries of children out of school for the season. I've killed people who hit me first and was called expletives and 'a kid.'  But I've also had numerous great heists with great people. Lots of helpful players, and really patient players. Lots of friendly, funny people just looking to have a good time with GTA and strangers.  My NUMBER ONE complaint is when people will leave halfway through a heist. It cancels the whole thing for everyone and it's super irritating. That, and the loading times are pretty rough.   Otherwise, there are tons of really great people and a lot of fun to be had here. And I really haven't run into anything that seems like hacking, which people said was rampant in all the reviews. Maybe it's gotten better.",

However, do not expect you can go online with your modified scripts and cheat menus designed for singleplayer. Some of these still work in GTA Online, so the anti-cheat system  will  ban you.

            "review_text": "Here's an honest review over GTAV. I only have 4.5 Hours currently on the PC Version, but i can tell you alot about the core game, i have played GTA V since its release in September 2013, yeah this game is over two years old now, and just released this April on the PC.  So, first off, why everyone comes to reviews, is to look at the Cons, ill start with those.  CONS~  -This game is a Cash Cow. R* Doesn't give a flying flip about you, unless your spending money on their shark cards (in game currecy). A good example, if you wanted to buy all the cars from the last DLC drop with real money, you would spend nearly $450 buying the cars and upgrading them all the way, this is only like 7 cars mind you, and doesn't include any of the houses, guns, clothing.   -R* Support/Servers both, suck. R* doesn't really care to help you with any problems unless its just a connection problem, but even then, you will more than likely will get a automated message, about 3-4 days after submitting a ticket, you're better off trying to talk to other players on the forums. Secondly, the servers tend to drop out alot, ive tried this from my own home, to my friends house in the city who has a 1GB internet speed, its the servers problem. With that said, you will also drop in and out of ghost lobbies too (by yourself), or just experince lag in a lobby with 10-15 people in it.  -Hackers/Modders. Their everywhere. First lobby i joined on PC had a hacker, who dropped me 300k. I submitted a ticket, which im still waiting for to get taken care of to remove it so i dont get banned. *Fingers crossed*. Then i hopped around, found a couple good lobbies, found one with a few guys where we went to the airport and started racing. This one kid shows up (literal kid, 13 year old squeaker), with a T20 while were all in muscle cars, he destroys us obviously, and we told him he's being a brat and needs to get the same class car, he ends up overclocking all of our characters (hacking) and made all 4 of our games crash, just because we 'told him to get a different car'. From stories i hear, theres even hackers that can get you banned by putting your name as theirs, and they go on killing sprees blowing up peoples cars, and placing you in the bad sport lobbies.  -Everything is overpriced. As i said ealier, this game is a cash cow, and they want your real life money. EVERY DLC the cars just get more and more expensive. Like recently in this low rider DLC, you can get a car for 30,000 (previously the DLC before this, the cheapest car was 400k). This isn't too bad, for a lowrider, but when you take it to the shop to 'upgrade' it to become a low rider custom, you have to drop 350k just to unlock the parts, then 75-150k each part for hydralics, dash, interior, wheels, etc etc. You'll easily spend 2m on the most recent DLC on just one car. Mind you, 1.2m is $20 real life money, and it is stupid hard to actually earn money in game, unless you spend 15 hours a day grinding heists to afford ONE car in a few days (45 hours total).  -Limited Customization. This game has been out for two years, and theres SO MANY faults in this game. Theres no black or white backwards hats, but there sure is green and purple. You cant have a regular ol bent foward hat, but you can have the swag flat bills. Theres tons of cars, that have no modifications, cant put a cowl hood on a el camino. Theres no body work out system, where you can tone your apperance, or get fat, everyone is slimmed. The Apartments are a joke, once you buy a 'High' Apartment, you pretty much own them all, and the only reason why you would buy any of the others aside from the cheapest one, is for location, or just to have another garage for more cars.  -Everyone is an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. You will just be cruising along on your street bike, jamming to your own self playlist, just to have a tryhard in a zentorno come flying at you, knock you off, and throw a sticky bomb at you, and drive away... They will repeat this 5x till you blow them up (which costs you money for destroying another players vehicle, and since zentornos are super cars, thats 25k outa your pocket just for the car), then they will go into passive mode (cant kill them), call in their car again, that you paid to replace, and start repeating. Theres at least 2 people like this, in every server. Who at the first sign of losing, will go get a tank/jet and ruin everyones fun. Can't tell you how many times ive tried to hold a car show on the XB1, with easily 20 people show up and get all parked, looking fancy, just for a guy to fly by in a jet and kill everyone till we all leave/hide underground.  -The game is unfinished. Yes, it is, i don't care what anyone says. Theres literally dozens of locations you can glitch into that have no purpose (yet). Good examples are how you could glitch into some of the prisons buildings, into the Labs, or the banks, because they were intended to be opened up later as DLC. Yes people, all the DLC you get, is already in the game, that their just 'unlocking'. R* is just milking this game for your money.   Now with this down, let me tell you why i do recommend this game.   Pros~  -You will never have a experince like this on any other game. I have lead a crew on GTA since the release, 'Player Killers', i started out small, and grew the crew into 600+ People, we were ranked #16 on the leader boards for TDM, we were a force. Slowly tho, the crew died out as the game got repeatative, and i ended up joining a MC(Motocylce club), Bound By Blood, and i stayed with them for over a year, it was really neat playing with 60 or so other players in the same crew, who role played as a biker club, and we would all ride in formation, it was something else, alot of memories, and drama, was made on this game, as also finding brothers who were passionate about the same things i was.  -You can practically do anything, and go to anywhere you see. Want to sky glide from the mountain to the ocean? Do it. You want to fly that jet upside down in that tunnel? Good luck, but do it. You want to ruin everyones car show by taking a Monster Truck through it? Do it. You want to go stunt biking in the city? Do it. You want to be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and ruin everyones day? Do it.  -Aside from R* obvious money hungry strategy, they do keep adding more DLC to the game (unlocking), areas, clothes, and cars about every 2-3 months, keeping the game fresh.   -You can make your own playlist on the radio from your own music folders, i currently have 150 songs in game on one radio station, on repeat, sadly other people cant hear it, but its really refreshing to listen to your own tunes in game.  -The Graphics are one of the best, even if its built on a older gen system, and just upped for PC, its still amazing, and you can download mods to make it even better (offline only).    Final Verdict: 8/10.  Other than the outstanding flaws in this game, from R* being greedy, bad support, and the player base full of hackers, the core game itself is pretty fun, and you can easily grind out 500+ hours from this game, 200+ from the story alone if you want to complete everything and take your time.",

            "review_text": "It is Grand Theft Auto; Do I even need to write a review?! Rockstar has always taken their time and realeased a game worth playing over and over again. They don't pump out a AAA title like Infinityward or Bungie, but they do a damn good job bringing their best in creativity and playability that is well worth the wait. There are features to be desired, but honestly no game is ever complete, and you are not the one making the financial decisions to produce this game. Rockstar's DRM is less desirable but unlike other titles like Ubisoft's WatchDog's the gameplay is not affected. I am running my Rig with two ATi Radeon 7950's in Crossfire and this game plays amazingly maxed out. There are not many games I can say work flawlessly with my Crossfire configuration, but this one takes the cake. When the game launched they made sure drivers were available to enhance the experience. Rockstar truly out did themselves with this game as it takes what the others had that was great and expanded on it. The campaign was not that long but the story was enjoyable, and the free roam is now much more pleasurable (with the millions). The campaign was not the main selling point with this edition of GTA as the Multiplayer has many promises that are in the process of being fulfilled. Mainly the Heist Update was the most anticipated part elaborated on early in the games development. It took a year to release this update but it was well worth it. The devs also have updated the game frequently with new content such as radio stations, masks, clothes, guns, and bug fixes. I have yet to been dissappointed with Rockstar, even in their early days they did a great job at Arcade style top-down gaming. I say it is a good game, and if you look elsewhere you will see most if not all of the reviews for this game are positive. BUY IT!",

I pre-ordered this puppy when it was first offered with the expectation of it releasing in March, only to have to wait another month. Was it worth it? Yes and no. Honestly, aside from the cash perk that the pre-order players got (which wasn't that much to be honest), it really wasn't worth the pre-order. However, Rockstar has slightly made up for that with the Ill Gotten Gains 1 and 2 DLCs bringing in new clothes, vehicles, and weapons. I can also definitely attest to how much better GTA V runs on the PC compared to it's somewhat crash-happy predecessor, GTA IV.  Another great perk of this PC title, is the third party mods that are available. I'm currently running LSPDFR by G17 Media, and it gives the game a much welcome breath of new life after you beat story mode and don't want to be online.   Speaking of online.. GTA Online is a massive improvement over the multiplayer side of GTA IV, as it allows much better customization and personalization overall, along with a much better playing field. Sure some people find ways to glitch or hack, but R* is cracking down on those that do in order to keep everything as fair as possible, which is another reason GTA:O is far superior to GTAIV Multiplayer.  I recommend picking this game up either now, or if/when the price comes down. You won't be disappointed",

Now I know that most of you are thinking that this is entirely on me, and that my rig isn't up to the task of running this game but I know my specs and I'll be damned if this thing can't run this game or any other game for that matter.  Anyways the game itself is one of the most enjoyable online experiences I've had in a long time, and for all of you out there that prefer to go it alone this game delivers an amazing story with rich gameplay and diverse campaign missions. There was never once that I felt that I was doing something as 'filler' only existing to lengthen the time needed to finish the game. The gun play is extremely polished and feels fluid, although first person view while shooting feels awkward as hell, but while driving it is my go to view.  This is my first Grand Theft Auto game, so I can't speak as to how it compares or differs from past titles but despite that on its own this game is definitely worth the price. Although if you want the best experience, in my opinion of course, then I recommend you have a friend who also has the game and play with them online. I haven't enjoyed a multiplayer experience like this is ages, there truly is nothing quite like being in a car chase while being shot at by police with armored vans, helicopters and swat vehicles.   All in all the game feels polished, plays like a top of the line AAA game, has a great campaign full of interesting characters, missions and gameplay.

Campaign / Singleplayer 9/10 I haven't played much of the campaign, but it's really good and isn't just focused on shooting people, which is what lot's of games can get carried away with. The campaign contains 3 main protagonists, Franklin, Michael and Trevor, it has a very though through storyline and is really fun to play. Alas, the game isn't perfect, the big problem that everyone hates is; WHERE IS SINGLE PLAYER INSURANCE?   Optimization 7/10: Okay, don't get me wrong, this is a good optimized game, however there are some annoying, but rarely occuring glitches. Firstly there are random frame drops, and I know this isn't me because a YouTube named: TotalBuiscuit gets this problem with SLI 980. Another problem that occurs is (it could be me, but I'm not sure) is keyboard lagg, and what I mean by 'keyboard lagg' is where occasionally whilst driving, I press a button on my keyboard (MadCatz Cyborg V5) it responds about 2 seconds later, it happens rareley, but it is really annoying when it does so.  *edit Community 7/10: Whilst playing online, the community are very nice, I have met one person who killed me for no reason and stole my car, so I killed him five times, besides that, most people don't really attack you unless you anger / disrupt them in any way. So far I have seen no hackers, modder or even glitchers which is really good. *edit: I've been insulted for failing a mission and for just chatting, but they are probably just little kids looking for trouble or trying to act 'badass' to their friends,  Graphics 10/10: The graphics with this game at 4K, maxed out are revolutionary, they set high standards for the computer gaming industry - god knows what the game will look like with ICenhancer, I doubt they could make the game look any better.",

I originally bought this game two or three days after its release and im gonna be honest it had performance issues and minor bugs but after a lot of updates the developers at rockstar managed to make it perfect. The game itself has a lot of content in singleplayer and a lot more in online. After you think you have seen and done everything that it has to offer(which is a lot), you will be delighted to know that it keeps updating with new and exciting dlc, completely free of charge, which is a really nice bonus considering the price tag. During sales its a no-brainer to go and buy this superb open-world game. The only negative about this game is its online matchmaking which sometimes connects you to full lobbys or randomly disconnects you from online altogether and forces you to go back to singleplayer to join back, but that is a really rare occasion. All in all i think that the developers at rockstar outdone themselves and brought us the best open-world game you can find. I recommend this game to everyone!! 10/10 (p.s it has heists!!!!)",

Theres a lot of things to do in freemode too, making an organization, buying a yacht and defending it, and many other things.The game is fun, but not really fun without friends , because you can do much more stuff with friends and have fun, when you play with randoms you're kinda more competitive and you dont see how fun the game actually is , when you play with friends you dont take the jobs as serious so you have more fun.I strongly recommend this game 11/10 IGN . If you have money and a good PC you should buy this game , have fun!",

Cons: Not well optimized for some PC machines.

My friends and I have good gaming PC's but mine isn't nearly as good as their's.

The world itself is fantastic, detailed, and was made with a level of attention that's usually unseen, and it's probably one of the most convincing open world games that I have played. It's almost impossible to see everything that the city has to offer. Anyways, to keep it short, ok story, but fun, with an amazing world to explore. Could be a little longer tho, maybe.  Also, special mention to the cast of the game, because the actors did a really good job portraying the in-game characters.  Multiplayer :  It's a mixed bag. I haven't had issues as other players but as any online game, with plenty of people the griefing, cheaters, and kids screaming on mics is to be expected. But...if you get some friends to play, it's truly a way, way better experience, specially for heists and other activities. Racing is fun (for me at least), there are some modes that are quite entertaining and earning money is not as hard as some people think, if you play the weekly 2X Money and RP activities you can earn a lot of cash in a couple of hours. Lots of customization also, from vehicles, to the character. Also, I have fun also just driving and doing dumb stuff on the world, trust me, that's also a pretty fun way to enjoy the game rather than playing exclusively missions. The constant updates are also decent, because they kinda help to keep the game getting stale.  TL;DR : A pretty decent game overall with plenty of replayability, but mostly better with friends if you wanna play online.",

Came back to it in the last few weeks, with VIP and CEO upgrades it makes the game alot more interesting, makes online play more fun and allows alot more progression opportunities.  You start off as a noob, struggle without weapons, do some missions and heist setups, eventually some heists finales which pay big. You can also become associates or 'underlings' of CEOs to help run their illegal trade runs in online play, which brings alot of fun moments and purpose to online which was lacking before, and through associate vehicle request, allows you to play with high level vehicles which the CEO owns in online, which you would otherwise nto be able to do.  Eventually you earn enough money through all of the above to finally buy your own office, and warehouse to become a CEO and start earning cash, with newer players as associates. You can see progression in your office, buy vehicles for your associates to use for free and earn lots of cash for the gucci gear. Sure there may be other faster ways to earn cash than CEO, but it still very good, and is most importantly more fun compared to other methods.  Despite the complaing about cash cards, you do not need to buy them at all. The game is the msot gun when you earn everything. I myself worked my way up from noob to CEO with office in not much time. Luxury fast cars which cost millions don't mean alot in online play. Work to get an armored kuruma and a buzzard helicopter and you can earn alot and be safe in online.",

Ladies and horses, we have a game that truly goes into the interest of a gamer, and I'm not referring to a fancy list of needs such as 'artistic', 'inspiring' or any liberal crap like that.

New generations are driving everything to ♥♥♥♥. Technologies are beyond human control and drugs are the the fastest growing market.  Huge sandbox map, with tons of random things and extras.

Taking the game literally you will easily get offended, but the game essentially channels the style of a Tarantino film. If you have played the game before then you know it is worth replaying.

My favorite part. It's intense, but there are just so many loading screens involved in this mode alone   Cons -Loading screens (really dominant in switching maps/modes of play while in a lobby session) -Graphic intensive (you'll need a high-ish end pc to run this on the higher graphical settings) -Third person movement on foot feels a little awkward with a PS4 controller ",

It also brings a fair amount of new stuff to do, compared to its lackluster predecessor, as well as a fleshed out online component. Unfortunately, it also comes with its share of issues.  For one, it's an incredibly hardware intensive game, and while you can run most of the settings at High or Very High, if you don't have a 3/4GB VRAM card, you're not going to be able to run textures on anything higher than Normal. It's also plagued by a few persistent issues, such as the custom radio causing stutter for many, and performance drops where they really shouldn't occur. Issues with shadows either not appearing or bugging out have also been reported (and experienced by myself).  Those issues aside, it's a better port than the previous games, and the online component works much better on a good desktop than it does on consoles. Loading times are good, and the new Director Mode allows you to unleash your inner Spielberg. If you've already played the console version, you know what to expect.

GTA V is the best GTA game after San Andreas, which I loved due to it being my childhood game and being the game to bring new things that year and with a huge map and possibilities. I have played this game both on Xbox360 and PC. It's amazing. The storyline is amazing, the graphics are great, the PC port is AWESOME (works smoother than on X360), comparing to GTA IV's port (which was ♥♥♥♥ on PC, very bad performance issues). The Online is great, as long as you don't play to grind it, and have some friends to play it. Anyways, the PC version &gt; Console is that there's some new features, and the files were already opened and modding should be available soon, thus we will see some good mods with no doubt. Truly a game of the year, for 2015 too.",

            "review_text": "Ah GTA 5, the best game ever made. Rockstar Games made yet another masterpiece.   Grand Theft Auto V, it tells the story of three criminals trying to team-up for a series of daring, yet very profitable, heists in the corrupt city of Los Santos. From what you can already tell, the game is set in a fictional city of Los Santos (inspired by L.A.) and there are three playable characters, each with their own story and skills in the game. There's the gang member (Franklin) who tries to stick to the life on the streets, mugging people, dealing drugs and selling drugs. But all that changes when he meets up with a professional ex-robber (Michael) looking for different opportunities and big bags of money. Then there's... the crazy one, the one everyone's scared of, Trevor, who is a violent maniac driven by the chance of the next big score. But obviously it can't be easy.  Okay enough of the story telling. As I said before there are three characters, Franklin, Michael and Trevor each with ther own different skills. Franklin has the ability to slow down time while in a vehicle, which gives the player a much wider turning circle and a speed boost. Michael is very skilled with his guns at his disposal, it allows him to slow down time (much like the Bullet Time in the Max Payne series) and gives the player the ability to get some sick headshots. Trevor is easily ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off, which means that he deals more damage and takes less damage.  Now comes the graphics. They are amazing, from the blinding lens flares to the very beautiful sunsets to the lovely looking city in the night the game looks amazing like that. Any computer can run this game, not on the highest settings of course, but it is still playable and the game still looks gorgeous on low settings. There is a down side though. Texture pop-ins, which is very annoying while flying. There is a setting however to crank the view distance up, although it does help, there are still texture pop-ins.  Gameplay is smooth as silk. And the missions are amazing, and the heists are fun. The heists start of like this. First you have choose how you want to approach the heist. You either go in guns blazing and butt ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Or you channel your inner ninja-skills and approach that way. That is always up to you. Second, obviously you're not doing it alone, so you need a crew. There are a few different ways you can do that. You can choose the people that the game already has to offer but most of them are cheap and terrible, while the others are experienced but rather expensive. Throughout the game you will find yourself in 'random events', those vary from civilians getting mugged and you either get the money back and return it or, you keep it for yourself. Some of those 'random events' involve acting as a getaway for a heist. Which leads to, if you decide to help them of course, them being at your disposal and then you can select them in the heist setup. Last but not least, you need the stuff. Which usually involves one of the three characters, or all of them if you please, to steal cars for a getaway and guns for when the ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan, which always happens. There are so many things you can do in GTA 5, you can hang out with friends and go for a drink, or have yourself a little private dance with the lovely ladies of the night.   And then there's the big thing. GTA Online. Which is set before the events of the single player. You basically create your own character and do whatever the hell you want really. You can race, hold up stores, participate in deathmatches, or as of the new DLC, be a CEO of your organzation and sell illegal goods which results in a payout. There isn't really much to say about GTA Online other then it's very much fun with friends.  Rockstar Games never fails to disapoint us with this series. And GTA 5 is no doubt the best one. The voice acting is outstanding, acting is amazing, and the story telling better than any movie you have ever seen.  10/10 It's a masterpiece allright. This is a must have, you won't be disapointed.",

GTA still hides too many secret and trust me, Rockstar playing cards has not been fully shown YET, just wait you'll see GTA V will be one of the most immersive AA Multiplayer game ever made.   Rockstar is giving us a game that will extend even far more, just like what they did with SA, though SA has its beautiful and unforgettable moments.

            "review_text": "Finally! A GTA game that actually has a great story and doesn't have alot of repetitive missions.  PROS: Story Mode -Each character has their own unique skill to use (wont spoil it) -You can level up stats for each character -Guns can be customized -Missions are not repetitive and quiet like other GTA games and always makes you want to keep playing to know what'll happen next -Missions also have checkpoints so you don't need to put in another 10 mins doing the same crap after dying -Optional First person mode. (If you've ever played Mirrors edge, you'll love this!) -Graphics are amazing! -People act like real shmeeple  -Ambience and atmosphere are amazing, you'll love taking screenshots! -Car Customization is back! -And Much Much More! (Sorry for the yelling lol)  CONS: Story Mode -Silenced weapons only work on specific missions, other than that they're useless (might be a bug) -You're limited in hair/clothes which kinda bothers me -You can't go in restraunts and get fat or build muscle (dont know why but I loved that in San Andreas ps2) -Cops have auto-aim and can ♥♥♥♥ing murder you from a distance lol seriously -You can die pretty easily but then again that's what makes this game so fun and realistic -First person cover peeking causes you to get shot, while third-person cover peeking doesn't (bug) -Using melee can sometimes be a pain in the ♥♥♥ because it's soo slow   Online Mode takes place before the events of Story Mode which I thought was really interesting.  PROS: Online Mode -Great character customization! (Male or Female) -A HUGE variety in clothes and hair styles -Guns can be customized (tho need to be unlocked first) -You can level up your characters stats -First Person Mode is amazing (Mirrors Edge much?) -Buyable Apts and Homes -Interactions from characters in story mode -There's a rediculious amount of ♥♥♥♥ to do aside from freeroaming in circles killing other people (which is fun too) -Try roleplaying on a solo server and doing w/e the hell you want, it's pretty fun  CONS: Online Mode -Can get boring pretty fast if your not working towards an ingame goal -Quickly! Press M and change the all talk to friends only lol seriously, some people are annoying over voice chat. -Press M again and make it so people dont take your car lol set it to passangers so people can carpool with you in Missions/Heists. -Silenced weapons are still useless and only work in specific missions -You die too easily, more so online than story mode which will kinda frustrate you at times if your a noob -Cops/Gangs/and even Pedestrians have a better shot at shooting you from a distance than you do lol -You need to shoot 100 people to unlock a color for a gun? -Too many Parachuting missions (Parachuting is fun but not THAT fun) -Using melee can sometimes be a pain in the ♥♥♥ because it's soo slow -There are still hackers every now and then, modding for story mode is fine, but online will cause you to get BANNED so be careful -The only way to restore health in missions is to be a fatass and eat snacks? -Sometimes it will be hard to do co-op missions with others online which can get annoying after putting almost 20 mins in a mission and at the last minute one guy decides to either rage-quit, gets disconnected due to poor internet, gets killed on purpose or accident, decides to troll you with a group of friends out of their own amusement, etc. (Not all online players are like that, but the ones that are are pretty vicious)   The Conclusion: I think this game is really badass! You actually get your moneys worth unlike other $59.99 games. Great to play with friends, and I really enjoyed Role-Playing in First Person Mode. Rockstar is still adding new content and I recommend giving this game a shot!  9/10",

Trump is the very definition of the American success story, continually setting the standards of excellence while expanding his interests in real estate, sports, and entertainment. He is the archetypal businessman – a deal maker without peer.  Mr. Trump started his business career in an office he shared with his father in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, New York. He worked with his father for five years, where they were busy making deals together. Mr. Trump has been quoted as saying, 'My father was my mentor, and I learned a tremendous amount about every aspect of the construction industry from him.' Likewise, Fred C. Trump often stated that 'some of my best deals were made by my son, Donald...everything he touches seems to turn to gold.' Mr. Trump then entered the very different world of Manhattan real estate.  In New York City and around the world, the Trump signature is synonymous with the most prestigious of addresses. Among them are the world-renowned Fifth Avenue skyscraper, Trump Tower, and the luxury residential buildings, Trump Parc, Trump Palace, Trump Plaza, 610 Park Avenue, The Trump World Tower (the tallest building on the East Side of Manhattan), and Trump Park Avenue. Mr. Trump was also responsible for the designation and construction of the Jacob Javits Convention Center on land controlled by him, known as the West 34th Street Railroad Yards, and the total exterior restoration of the Grand Central Terminal as part of his conversion of the neighboring Commodore Hotel into the Grand Hyatt Hotel. The development is considered one of the most successful restorations in the City and earned Mr. Trump an award from Manhattan's Community Board Five for the 'tasteful and creative recycling of a distinguished hotel.' Over the years, Mr. Trump has owned and sold many great buildings in New York including the Plaza Hotel (which he renovated and brought back to its original grandeur, as heralded by the New York Times Magazine), the St. Moritz Hotel (three times and now called the Ritz Carlton on Central Park South) and until 2002, the land under the Empire State Building (which allowed the land and lease to be merged together for the first time in over 50 years).  Additionally, the NikeTown store is owned by Mr. Trump, on East 57th Street and adjacent to Tiffany's. In early 2008, Gucci opened their largest store in the world in Trump Tower.  In 1997, the Trump International Hotel &amp; Tower opened its doors to the world. This 52 story mixed–use super luxury hotel and residential building is located on the crossroads of Manhattan's West Side, on Central Park West at Columbus Circle. It was designed by the world-famous architect, Philip Johnson, and has achieved some of the highest sales prices and rentals in the United States. As one of only three hotels in the nation to have received a double Forbes Five-Star rating for both the hotel and its restaurant, Jean-Georges, it has also received the Five Star Diamond Award from the American Academy of Hospitality Sciences, and was voted the number one business hotel in New York City by Travel + Leisure Magazine. Conde Nast Traveler Magazine has named it the number one hotel in the US, and its innovative concept has been copied worldwide. It has won the Forbes Five-Star Hotel Award each year from 2009 to 2015 and ranked in the Conde Nast Traveler 'Readers' Choice' awards every year since 2010. This year marks the eighteenth anniversary of this Trump Hotel Collection gem.  Mr. Trump was also the developer of the largest parcel of land in New York City, the former West Side Rail Yards which is now Trump Place. On this 100 acre property, fronting along the Hudson River from 59th Street to 72nd Street, is the largest development ever approved by the New York City Planning Commission. There are a total of 16 buildings on the site, with Mr. Trump building the first nine buildings and the other portion of land being sold for a substantial amount. Mr. Trump also donated a 25 acre waterfront park on Trump Place and a 700 foot sculptured pier to the city of New York.  Other acquisitions in New York City include The Trump Building at 40 Wall Street, the landmark 1.3 million square foot, 72-story building located in Manhattan's Financial District, directly across from the New York Stock Exchange and the tallest building in downtown Manhattan. This purchase, which took place at the depths of the New York City real estate market, is said to be one of the best real estate deals made in the last twenty-five years and is considered to have one of the most beautiful 'Tops' of any building in the country. In addition, Mr. Trump built 610 Park Avenue (at 64th Street), formerly known as the Mayfair Regent Hotel, which was very successfully converted into super-luxury condominium apartments achieving, at that time, the highest prices on Park Avenue. Further east, adjacent to the United Nations, sits the spectacular Trump World Tower, a 90-story luxury residential building and one of the tallest residential towers in the world. The Trump World Tower has received rave reviews from the architectural critics, with Herbert Muschamp of the New York Times calling it 'a handsome hunk of a glass tower.' Likewise, Trump World Tower is considered one of the most successful condominium towers ever built in the United States.  In 2001, Mr. Trump announced plans for his first foray into Chicago, where he planned to build the Trump International Hotel &amp; Tower/Chicago. The 2.7 million square foot, 92-story mixed-use tower is located on the banks of the Chicago River, directly west of Michigan Avenue (the most prominent site in Chicago), and is one of the tallest residences in the world and the ninth tallest building in the world. The architect is Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, Chicago, and the tower also includes four levels of retail shops. The hotel opened in January of 2008 to great acclaim, and in 2010 received Travel + Leisure Magazine's award as the #1 Hotel in the US and Canada as well as their 'World's Best Business Hotel' Award in 2014. Conde Nast Traveler ranked the hotel in its 'Readers' Choice Awards' every year since 2011. The hotel has earned Five-Star ratings for hotel and restaurant in the Forbes Travel Guide Awards in 2014 and 2015, and has been a AAA Five Diamond Hotel award winner since 2011.  In 2002, Mr. Trump purchased the fabled Delmonico Hotel, located at 59th Street and Park Avenue and re-developed it into a state-of-the-art luxury 35 story condominium named Trump Park Avenue. It was Mr. Trump's desire to make this one of the most luxurious buildings in New York City, which was achieved. Mr. Trump has been lauded by a multitude of publications for having retained the grandeur and charm of the building while incorporating 21st century services and amenities. Mr. Trump is co-owner, with Vornado Realty Trust, of the iconic 555 California Street Tower (The Bank of America building) in San Francisco, one of the most important office buildings on the West Coast of the U.S., and the prized 1290 Avenue of the Americas building, one of New York's biggest buildings with the largest office floorplates in New York.  Mr. Trump's portfolio of holdings also includes Trump National Golf Club in Westchester, NY, a signature Fazio golf course and residential development, and a 250 acre estate known as the Mansion at Seven Springs, the former home of Katharine Graham (of The Washington Post and Rockefeller University), which will be developed into a world class luxury housing development. Mr. Trump also purchased one of the largest parcels of land in California which fronts, for two and a half miles, along the Pacific Ocean. A Donald J. Trump championship golf course, called Trump National Golf Club/Los Angeles, has been built on this site, and it has been voted the number one golf course in California. Seventy-five luxury estates will follow.",

INGREDIENTS: For the Streusel: ½ cup all-purpose flour ½ cup light brown sugar ½ teaspoon ground allspice 5 Tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into bits   For the Muffins: 2 cups all-purpose flour ½ cup granulated sugar 1 Tablespoon baking powder ½ teaspoon ground allspice ¼ teaspoon salt ¼ cup light brown sugar 1 stick (8 Tablespoons) unsalted butter, melted and cooled 2 large eggs ¾ cup whole milk ¼ teaspoon vanilla extract   DIRECTIONS: 1. Center a rack in the oven and preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Butter or spray the 12 molds in a regular-size muffin pan or line with paper cups. Place the muffin pan on a baking sheet.  2. To make the streusel, put the flour, brown sugar, and allspice in a small bowl and whisk to combine. Add the bits of cold butter and toss, pinching the mixture between your fingers, until you have pea-sized crumbs. Set aside in the refrigerator. (The streusel can be made up to 3 days ahead and stored, covered, in the refrigerator.)  3. To make the muffins, in a large bowl whisk together the flour, granulated sugar, allspice, baking powder, and salt. Stir in the brown sugar, making certain there are no lumps. In a large glass measuring cup or another bowl, whisk together the melted butter, eggs, milk and vanilla extract until well combined. Pour the liquid ingredients over the dry ingredients and with the whisk or a rubber spatula, gently but quickly stir to blend. The batter will be lumpy; that is how it should be.  4. Divide the batter evenly among the muffin cups. Sprinkle streusel over each muffin, then use your fingertips to gently press the crumbs into the batter.  5. Bake for about 20 minutes, or until the tops are golden and a thin knife inserted into the center of the muffins comes out clean. Transfer the pan to a wire rack and cool for 5 minutes before carefully removing each muffin. Cool completely on the wire rack. Muffins can be stored, in an airtight container, at room temperature for up to 5 days. ",

            "review_text": "It's not as charming and wonderful as GTA IV was when it was first announced and later on released for PC, but it is really great!  The world feels and is a lot bigger, but GTA IVs Liberty City felt somewhat more like an actual city, it felt like home, whilst GTA V only feels like California (which San Andreas is based on). The characters are really great, but somewhat boring if you think of it. Michael is a burnt out bank robber with tons of cash and still wants/needs more, and has the family drama of a housewife of what ever state show on TV.  Franklin is a *clears throat* 'gangbanger' who doesn't want to be one, but still ends up being one, whom later ends up *SPOILER, but duh* robbing banks and is the only sensible of the three.  And Trevor is the psycho we all end up loving because of his, rather peculiar way of being a person.   Don't take me wrong here, the story is great, but I never felt it being a movie or a game, rather something you go through and forget bigger parts of the story only remembering one or two heists.   This game is really great, but, I feel kinda burned out on games like these. GTA V put my enjoyment barrier through the roof, as it has made it hard for me to actually touch any other game in the Third Person 'Anarchy Sim' genre.  '-Was it worth the wait?' Yes, yes it was. '-Was it worth playing?' Yes and no, yes because I ♥♥♥♥ing love the GTA series and no because now I don't feel like playing anything else. Plus the driving is just tedious comparing to the heavy and 'hard' driving in GTA IV, which I enjoyed A LOT.   I'll still have that big chunk of room in my heart for GTA IV, GTA V did not steal it as GTA IV did.  Other than what I said, this is the game we've all been waiting for since it was first announced, but it made me into a spoiled little gamer that probably will never ever play any other Third Person Free Roaming Sandox game.  Oh and Online, it's only fun with some pals, pubs are either you ending up dead in the gutter or your car somewhere in the ocean making you have to pay for it...",

I can tell you hell yes with the additional graphics improvements made to the game along with the 60 frames the game feels a lot more smoother and richer visually essentially they have taken their time with this port and if you was to ask me would I buy it again I would say yes, yes and yes.  Along with the improvements being made to the games visuals we also have the online where 30 players can be on the same server including two spectators. You will also be able to import your character from the previous versions of GTA rather 'Inferior' versions of GTA into the PC port.  Personally with the time I have spent on it so far it feels and looks like a different game with me having played the 360, Xbox One and now PC versions of the game. and if you are contemplating on whether you should get this game then I would strongly recommend that you do as you will not regret it at all.  Finally in terms of hardware requirements I feel that Rockstar have done what most publishers haven't. They have considered everyone who cannot afford a high end system and with that in mind their minimum specifications are not very demanding the only demanding aspect of this game will be its 4K resolutions. And the game is generally one of the best ports that I have ever played on PC.",

It is so well made, I would go as far to say its my favourite singleplayer story, and I have played Half-Life, so that says something. The characters have interesting personalities, and they interact with eachother almost all the time during missions, so it creates some hilarious situations for the characters. I'm not going to spoil anything, but the game has excellent writing, the climaxes and build-up for the climaxes are extremely well done. The jokes are funny, the dialougue is interesting, and the characters personalities are constant. What I find really cool is if you do more than 1 playthrough of the singleplayer, the characters have multiple lines for the same line. I know it sounds confusing, but let me explain. Let's say in one mission Micheal was driving Franklin to a coffee shop, and in playthrough 1 (P1) Micheal says: 'So, since we have nothing to do, why don't we go grab some coffee?' and Franklin says 'Alright, lets go. I was feeling like some caffine anyway' in playthrough 2 (P2) Micheal instead says: 'Man! I'm feeling like some coffee! What about you Frank?' and Franklin instead says: 'Hell yeah! I want some latte's and ♥♥♥♥!' see what I mean? Rockstar went the extra mile to make multiple playthroughs more enjoyable. The best part about doing multiple playthroughs is you get to choose the other heist option. Throughout the game, the characters will do heists for money, and in almost all of them you get a reward. In most of them, you get 2 options from Lester (or Trevor) on how to go through with the heist. You only get to make this decision once in a playthrough, so doing 2 playthroughs is needed to get every option. Some of the options are too close, like in the first heist, the 'Loud' option is the most sensible, because you do less work for the same reward, but I find the most players choose the second option just because it's called 'Smart' and it's more complicated. This is good writing on Rockstar's part, because it makes players think about a second option when the first is much easier. I will give the Singleplayer a 10/10. You probably want to know about the Online portion of the game. Well I will rate that CHAOS/10. The experience in Online will vary from player to player, because of the people you may meet, and what those people may help you with, or kill you with. This is the end of my review. If you get the game, do the singleplayer first, and then dive into the craziness that is Online.",

Once you get the swing of the match matching, it takes patience because you will be enjoying load screens and mach making screens allot if you are playing on your own. Starting a heist on your own can take from 5-10 minutes to get a full lobby per mission and there are 5, not to mention the load into and out of free play after every setup. If you don't have an SSD, now is the time to invest. Hackers are a problem and they are not, I will explain. You will run into a hacker every time you play. The upside is that if you don't keep cash on you but deposit it, then its nothing but a minor annoyance. They kill you you spawn 100 ft away no negative consequences to you. If they blow up your personal vehicle they have to pay for the new one. So being a hacker with teleporting and so on is useless out side of minor trolling, I don't see the appeal but apparently they like it. One thing that will happen allot is server crashes, they occur on the regular like allot allot, to the point its common place and accepted (BUT THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE FOR A MULTI-MILLION DOLLAR IF BILLION DOLLAR PROFIT GAME). I am in a crew and I am not the only one. This only happens when you are in free mode mucking about. Good thing is it doesn't drop you from the game, just everyone in the server leaves, leaving it empty with just you. Connecting back to free mode after a job or heist is also hit and miss, and will hang up about 15-20% of the time, even kicking you back to single player. Thankfully you can join a job or heist(if invited) from single. The game will attempt to connect you to a new session/heist/job by pulling you from your session(waiting), then it realizes it cannot connect to the full server(waiting), then it connects you back to a new session(waiting), and then you get to try it all over again. All in all the game is a blast, even when you get a night of load screens.",

Its the same level of dev and community communications as those publishers in south east asia.  Here are some example (warning: rant ahead, skip to the (skip))  First case i once had a problem with my connection to the cloud server, like a good citizen of the internet, i googled, what i found was tons of outdated discussion with no good definite answer and in every discussion there is Rockstar official response saying : please submit a support ticket.  and one day after a major update, my problem disappeard, magically!  but... thats left with one conclusion doesn't it? the server kinda sucks.  it left me wondering, why is that a server that is as major game as GTA V, rarely got a maintenance notice? do they regularly maintained it? or they just sittin their as off?  The team might be underfunded is the only logical reasoning i can think of.  Second case: Its Expansion/DLC release day. No day one hot fixes. That moment i knew Rockstar is one bold MF  (skip)  all and all, GTA V is the flagship for Rockstar,  i could understand why they are all hush hush about bugs and economy balance in the game.  Its like they are protecting their only child from porn.  if you're just looking for a good time blowing up people thats speaks in squares with your friends, yeah you will find it online mode.

Want to takle the single player story ( which actually exists in this day and age, and its good if you can get past the subject matter) ? Done. Want to cruise around getting money so you can upgrade you're crap, get a house, and cars etc...etc.. ? Done.

            "review_text": "Grand Theft Auto V is an open world, action-adventure video game developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games. Set within the fictional state of San Andreas (based around Southern California), the single-player story follows three criminals and their efforts to commit heists while under pressure from the government agency. The open world design lets players freely roam San Andreas, which includes open countryside and the fictional city of Los Santos (based on Los Angeles). The game is played from either third-person or first-person view, and its world is navigated on foot or by vehicle.   You control the three lead protagonists throughout the single-player mode switching between them both during and outside of missions. The story is centred on the heist sequences, many of the missions involve shooting and driving gameplay. Outside of missions, you can freely roam the big open world. Mostly composed of the San Andreas open countryside area and fictional city of Los Santos, the world of Grand Theft Auto V is much larger in area than earlier entries in the series. The single-player mode lets players control three characters: Michael De Santa, Trevor Philips and Franklin Clinton criminals whose stories interconnect as they complete missions. You can use melee attacks, firearms and explosives to fight enemies, and may run, jump, swim or use vehicles to navigate the world.   Throughout single-player, you may switch between the protagonists at will by using directional compass on the HUD. The game may switch between the characters automatically in single-player missions to complete the objectives. A character's compass avatar will flash red if is in danger and needs help, and flash white if he has a advantage. Overall I give GTA V a 9/10 stars it is a huge improvement to it's predecessor. I absolutely recommend you get this game because I am just absolutely without single doubt sure that Grand Theft Auto V will not disappoint you in anyway at all!.",

After playing this game for a few hours I realized the price was a bargain with how much fun I got out of the game and still do. I highly recommend the game for people who want a game you wont put down for hours at a time and like addicting games. While I had a lot more fun multiplayer the singleplayer wasn't bad in the slightest getting the same free feeling you get in multiplayer, the characters are memorable and whether you're online or offline you'll have hours o enjoyment.",

It gets old. - The MSAA is screwed up on my R9270x, so I have to use FXAA (No, I'm not overclocking) - You can tell the vehicles are really designed for an analog controller, it's hard to maintain good speed  Finally, the pros: - Well optimized, it runs a smooth 60fps (I honestly don't see how console gamers manage 30) - It feels like L.A. with a few less people (I live in L.A., love the buses) - You can kidnap someone in a pink hatchback, burn said hatchback, and throw said person into a sand pit at a golf course before proceeding to brutalize them - You can hijack a taco truck, drive it to the middle of a huge stadium, and use gasoline to draw satanic symbols to perform a public taco demoic ritual - Multiplayer exists (Not superb but certainly fun) - You can get tons of cool cars - The graphics menu tells you how much VRAM your current settings need  Is this game worth my time? Yes, if you can put up with lack of weapon variety and a not-so-good UI.  Is this game fun? This game is very open-world, it is what you make it.  Can I run It? With a modern $200 graphics card, a mid-range processor (100-200$), and 8GB of RAM (preferably not 1333Mhz or under), this game runs at 60fps on high settings. Thus, if you have a 500$ laptop, it will probably run around low-mid settings at 30-50 fps. Rockstar has posted specs, but 'Minimum' and 'Recommended' specs are rarely that useful.  Should I buy it? If you are spending 60$ on a game, and you like GTA/open world games, its good. Take a look at Far Cry 4, Dragon Age: Inquisition, Elite: Dangerous, or other $60 games beforehand if you aren't a huge GTA fan.  Final Thoughts: It would be excellent with a nicer UI and textures, but Rockstar did a good job on this one. I just hope they don't pull a Watchdogs on us and have a hidden ini tweak to make the whole game look amazing. Its open world, its violent, and you can get a taco truck.",

The Bad: 100% SP progress did not transfer :-/  Edit: after 50 hours, still no crashes; framerate has gone into the 30's underwater a couple times, and one time while skydiving it dropped a lot of frames and got extremely choppy for about 5-10 seconds, but other than that it has run satisfactory.",

            "review_text": "The PC version of GTA V is definitely the best version. We had to wait really long, but the game finally came out in a fantastic state. Rockstar obviously put a lot of time into the PC port/version. I'm usually against pre-ordering games, but I made one exception this year for GTA, and im happy with my decision. I didn't do it for the pre-order bonus (because that was frankly just a disappointing money cheat) , I did it just so I could preload all GB's in time for launch, because the game is ridiculously big.   I'm running it at 60-90 fps on 1920x1080 with most things on 'high', except for the advanced options, which is something you should only use if your running SLI or one really good card. I have a Nvidia gtx 680, which is a few years old now, so im very impressed with how good I can get the game to run. You can also use GeForce experience with GTA, because Nividia released a update for that day before launch.  You can play GTA in first or third person mode, and simply change between them on your controller. All cars have different interiors and looks when you are driving in first person. Some textures are a little blurry in first person, but that is something to expect in a game of this size. Fighting, swimming, walking can also be done in first person, so you can just pick what you like the best.  If you have an SSD drive that is big enough for this game you should probably use that for GTA, because the loading screens without it is sometimes very long. It's one of the only complains I have with GTA actually. Thankfully thats just when you are loading into story mode or online, because once you are in the big world there is no invisible walls or loading screens.  Singleplayer is fun and the 3 main characters are all very well written. You can swap between them in the open world, but also in certain quests. Michael, Trevor and Franklin are very different from eachother which makes the game more interesting then GTA IV's only character, Niko.  GTA online is probably what some people will spend a ton of time in. I really just bought it for the single-player experience, but after playing a few hours with my friends I have to say that GTA online is actually really fun. I think the missions will get kind off repetitive in the long run, but to play free-roam with friends will never get old. You also unlock heist in level 12, so that might refresh things even more.  I play this game with an xbox controller and it seems like all friends I've talked to is doing the same thing. I strongly recommend it, at least for the driving. You can enable auto-aim on your controller if you think shooting with it is too hard, or you can swap between your keyboard+mouse in combat, and use controller for driving. When you crash your car and get hit the controll vibrates, which I think makes you feel more immersed in the game.  I tried the PC controls and I didn't like them at all. For example you have to hit 'Z' to see how many players are on your server in online mode. You can however rebind all keys on keyboard, mouse, and controller so thats really good, but the default ones on keyboard are not great im afraid.  GTA is a fantastic open world game that will no doubt be played for many years to come. I have already played it a lot and I feel like I have much more leveling to do in GTA online, much more to do and explore in singleplayer and many hours of fun with my close friends to come. Singleplayer was all I really needed, so I will just see GTA online as a plus.  Well done Rockstar! This is the best PC version you have ever made and I can see that you put a lot of effort, time and love into creating it. Strongly recommend this title to all my friends, whether your the single or multiplayer guy, you will have a ton of fun. This will probably be one of the best games released this year.",

            "review_text": "It's an amazing game yet it needs some patching. Once in every two or three hours I (and my friends) are heaving a memory leak and game freezes (like 0.1 fps) until restart. I am using a laptop with two videocards so each time I start launcher it crashes unless I turn one of videocards off while it loads. It is rather annoying.  Optimization itself is pretty fine, I wasn't sure that my laptop will handle this game but it does.  And speaking about actual game aside of these memory leaks and various issues with starting up the game - its grate. I had little faith in GTA series after IV being a boring trash, but GTAV learned on the mistakes of the previous chapter. Characters are more original and charismatic.  Unlike in GTAIV where you had to do 5 missions between every 'story' mission, each task in GTAV makes sense and does not feel boring at all.  Downsides in GTA Online: Dozens of glitches and bugs that are both annoying and even game breaking. But what is most important (and frustrating) is loading times and amount of these said loading times. After almost every action you have to stare at the loading screen (from 15 to 60 seconds).   Example 1 (Remember, like I said - each loading is bout 30 seconds):  Join online -&gt; loading -&gt; failed to connect -&gt; loading -&gt; Join online -&gt; loading -&gt; Joined, but friends are in another 'world' -&gt;   First option:  Join friends -&gt; loading -&gt; A lot of players in here, do you want to wait in Queue? -&gt; No -&gt; Loading  Second option: Join friends -&gt; Do you want to wait in queue? -&gt; Ok, fine! -&gt; Loading -&gt; You spawn in some game world that is different from your first one, for a duration of queue -&gt; Loading -&gt; Joined friends  Example 2  Join heist -&gt; loading -&gt; joined heist, lobby leader is starting the heist in 10 seconds -&gt; one of party members left the lobby -&gt; disconnecting -&gt; loading  Example 3: Join random heist/job -&gt; loading -&gt; You don't want to do that particualr thing -&gt; leave -&gt; loading",

However, there are a few things to keep in mind. The following is a list of things that you should consider before making the plunge.  1) The load screens- Jesus they're bad. If you ever played the original version on Xbox/PS3, you know how bad they were. Well, they're not much better. The initial load into the game, regardless of SP or MP, is a solid 3-5 minute wait. In online, its even worse. Load into a heist? 20 second load screen. Get kicked? 20 second load screen. Joining a new session? 30 second load screen I've heard SSDs alleviate the issue however.  2) The community- I've seen a worse community in maybe Call of Duty and that's about it. Anyone joining a heist for the finale demands 20-25% of the cut, despite them not having helped with any of the setups. Then they leave after only a few attempts, because why bother working for your money? Not even to mention the amount of griefers in freeroam online and the hackers. There have been 2 separate occasions where I simply entered my car after spawning and got blown up with zero players around. I suggest making sure you have at least 3 friends to play with.  3) Mods- By all means get this game if you want to be a fire breathing cat. However, understand that if you go online, even if you don't use mods simply having the modded files might get you banned. As long as you remove the mods before you go online you should be fine.  Get this game at full price if you know you're going to enjoy it despite these issues. Otherwise, wait for a price drop.",

It is so well made, I would go as far to say its my favourite singleplayer story, and I have played Half-Life, so that says something. The characters have interesting personalities, and they interact with eachother almost all the time during missions, so it creates some hilarious situations for the characters. I'm not going to spoil anything, but the game has excellent writing, the climaxes and build-up for the climaxes are extremely well done. The jokes are funny, the dialougue is interesting, and the characters personalities are constant. What I find really cool is if you do more than 1 playthrough of the singleplayer, the characters have multiple lines for the same line. I know it sounds confusing, but let me explain. Let's say in one mission Micheal was driving Franklin to a coffee shop, and in playthrough 1 (P1) Micheal says: 'So, since we have nothing to do, why don't we go grab some coffee?' and Franklin says 'Alright, lets go. I was feeling like some caffine anyway' in playthrough 2 (P2) Micheal instead says: 'Man! I'm feeling like some coffee! What about you Frank?' and Franklin instead says: 'Hell yeah! I want some latte's and ♥♥♥♥!' see what I mean? Rockstar went the extra mile to make multiple playthroughs more enjoyable. The best part about doing multiple playthroughs is you get to choose the other heist option. Throughout the game, the characters will do heists for money, and in almost all of them you get a reward. In most of them, you get 2 options from Lester (or Trevor) on how to go through with the heist. You only get to make this decision once in a playthrough, so doing 2 playthroughs is needed to get every option. Some of the options are too close, like in the first heist, the 'Loud' option is the most sensible, because you do less work for the same reward, but I find the most players choose the second option just because it's called 'Smart' and it's more complicated. This is good writing on Rockstar's part, because it makes players think about a second option when the first is much easier. I will give the Singleplayer a 10/10. You probably want to know about the Online portion of the game. Well I will rate that CHAOS/10. The experience in Online will vary from player to player, because of the people you may meet, and what those people may help you with, or kill you with. This is the end of my review. If you get the game, do the singleplayer first, and then dive into the craziness that is Online.",

The game looks gorgeous without crappy mods, and really puts the player into the game.  As for the online, it's a great concept, but severely flawed.  To begin with many players go around killing each other for no apparent reason except for the hell of it. You get called a chicken for going into passive to stop being blown up by these idiots. GTA: Online was clearly designed so that the player could do virtually anything within the game's limits, something which many of these griefers fail to comprehend. Hackers roam free killing and ruining the game for other players, while some simply mind their own business as they do not want to mess with others (this I do not mind). By far the biggest issue is there is no regulation. How hard would it be to implement an staff system with administraitors so playing the game without being blown to pieces every god damn second would be possible?  People in other reviews are also defending the horrifyingly bad deal during the sale by saying you don't want it don't buy it. Rockstar also commited an error during the summer steam sale by not lowering the prices and appeared to be using shady business tactics by forcing a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ micro-transaction card into the purchase to keep it at the same bloody price instead of just lowering it. Why should I have to pay for a stupid card instead of getting the game at a discount?  Overall, buy the game for SP, but if you play online, don't expect a good fun time.",

It feels fluid and alive to play. Time passes organically, characters' lives progress, and there is a simply astounding quantity of side activities in which to engage. It's quite possible to explore the state of San Andreas for hours without moving the main story forward a stitch. In fact, that's part of the fun. And it's all been polished to a glossy sheen. The controls feel great, the visuals are lush, and a brilliant graphical interface empowers players, giving them all the information they need -- and only the information they need -- exactly when they need it. However, the writing isn't quite as sharp as it has been in previous installments; the humor is a bit broader and less sophisticated, and the main characters aren't as well developed (probably because there are now three), but this only impacts the overall experience a little. It remains a very impressive game.",

After watching a few reviews on this version, I was under the impression that it was practically impossible to use the keyboard and mouse. This was not the case. The only thing in the game I found difficult was flying. So I would suggest using a controller for that element of the game. The only other downside I can think of is that it requires a high-end gaming machine to run in true HD with 60 fps.

Since originally writting the review I have flirted with a few other games and even had a Minecraft relapse and yet I keep coming back to GTA V, I have clocked nearly an extra 1000 hours on this game since originally posting and forsee many more being spent.  So why is this game so good? Its perpetually groundbreaking. There are no other games out there to my knowledge that have the immersion as GTA V, sometimes it feels that your living more in San Andreas than in real life, the things you can do in this game seem never ending and just when you have spent ridiculous ammounts of time on this game Rockstar release more content, and not just crappy free DLC, Actual content that gets you excited! Whenever something new is coming out teasers are found on the net that get you so excited that you cant wait to play the game again, it keeps recreating that wow moment that makes you go 'Man I want to play that game!!'   C'mon man is it really that good? YESS!! When ever you log on you could be on your way to any number of adventures, what happens once you log on is totally up to you, you could be a racer hanging out at Car Meets and go around doing up mad cars and racing them, placing high stakes bets on yourself to win. You could be an explorer and let me tell you there are plenty of places to explore and not all of them are easy to find get to, I still see new things in this game I have not seen before. You could be a merc, a boss, an angel or a prick, the options only end with you, chances are if you can think of it you can do it in this game.  Surely it has some bad points? Well nothing is perfect, thats human. GTA does have some issues from time to time however they are kind of like a prickle in your toe at a carnival with free rides.. it's annoying and even hurts a bit but at the time the only thing on your mind is playing more. There have been issues with hackers in this game, there are funny glitches sometimes, drop outs here and there, loading can take a bit of time. However, to be fair, Rockstar have not sat back on this and have done alot of work on this since release. There are now fewer hackers than I have ever seen, glitches seem to be less and the game just feel polished. As long as your not going to try and run this HUGE game on a potato PC, I think you will love it.

This game lives up to all of the hype, all of the reviews and all of the jokes. If you are looking for the best GTAV experience please play with a group of reliable, close friends who are willing to grind a little to get up in the world.   First of all the story mode. Excellent. Filled to the brim with jokes, gags, brilliant acting and incredible writing GTAV truly provides a great single player game with 100hrs+ of content. 10/10  The online mode is a tricky one... If you do as I say and play with some close friends then you will most definitely enjoy the experience. What you shouldn't do is hop into GTAO open sessions and get modders to give you money, that ruins the experience entirely and will prevent your playtime from reaching 50hrs in GTAO as well as wasting your money. The DLC (all free I might add) can get a little bland at times but each new release is treated like a whole new game nonetheless, the top 3 in my opinion are as follows.   1. Executives and Other Criminals 2. Heists 3. Lowriders Part 1  These updates all add new features and ways to cooperate with other players in the game which is definitley when the game excells the most. Working with other players, be it randoms or friends, is the single most satisfying thing. If you do coooperate you can make your own criminal empire, with your own brand of crime and power that will let you take control of anyone who dares stand in your way.  Well... this is mainly just a GTAO review, but that's all you'll really be playing anyway :P  Overall review score : 9/10 (Because of R* only just beginning to listen to our cries for decent DLC and greifing/money giving modders that ruin the game experience for everyone)  This review has come from someone who has played the game across platforms with over 1000 hours. I hope you agree or just enjoy this masterpiece in your own way.",

It feels fluid and alive to play. Time passes organically, characters' lives progress, and there is a simply astounding quantity of side activities in which to engage. It's quite possible to explore the state of San Andreas for hours without moving the main story forward a stitch. In fact, that's part of the fun. And it's all been polished to a glossy sheen. The controls feel great, the visuals are lush, and a brilliant graphical interface empowers players, giving them all the information they need -- and only the information they need -- exactly when they need it. However, the writing isn't quite as sharp as it has been in previous installments; the humor is a bit broader and less sophisticated, and the main characters aren't as well developed (probably because there are now three), but this only impacts the overall experience a little. It remains a very impressive game.",

I myself, cannot say it`s perfect, and yes the ban system is WAY out of whack, but there is a silver lining to this game.   Pros: -It is, in my opinion, an AMAZING way to get together with friends and just absolutly wreck the town/each other. I think that there is no better way than to get together and just goof around. It`s an amazing experience to play this game with other people who want to try out the same whacky s*** that you want to try! -It`s a great experience from the other versions of GTA online that we have been able to try. GTA 4 was awesome as hell, but this adds so much onto it in such a tremendous way. -The constant, but limited in time, DLC keeps you busy. Want to be a CEO, or run a your own chapter in a bike gang? Do you want to spin loops and run like a cracked out bunny while possibly breaking speed records? You can! Even though the DLC isn`t what everyone wants (cough cough zombies), It`s still entertaining to see what they throw out at us. -The full ability to customize/transfer your character. I`m really glad this was an option.  Cons:  -The banning system that Rockstar has put on this game does more than just damper the experience. It leaves good and fair players in fear at the risk of getting temporarily, or even permanatly banned. If you`re like me and you have invested WAY to much time and money into your character, getting banned is like having a chunk of you ripped from you and lit on fire. Over the course of the life of GTA V`s life, the system has gotten more and more strict on what players can, and cannot do. This turns players off immensly. -There are players who just want to watch the world burn, literally. I was always paranoid on getting on public servers even before the ban switch was flipped. People are such a** munches when it comes to this game. yes I understand that It is a public lobby and that it does happen, but there is a time when enough is enough.  -Shark Cards....The only way to get your bonus money is to actually buy it from the Rockstar site itself....   Overalll, GTA V is a stunningly beautiful game that has entertained me for hours. Yes, it has its issues, and no I`m not neccissarily defending Rockstars ban system, but if you have the right people, this could be one of the most amazing games for you. Let this game bring you as much entertainment and joy as it has for me. Also remember, not everyone out there in that world is out to get you. Some of us are actually good people.",

However, I do feel that there are some issues with this game:  1. Whenever you discard a weapon, it automatically re-enters your inventory when you join a new session. This is annoying when you're in a vehicle and have to cycle through 7 different pistols and 3 SMGs just to equip sticky bombs, which brings me to my next point.  2. No weapon wheel when in a vehicle, again, this makes it uneccessarily tedious to equip the weapon you want. If you overshoot the weapon you want to equip (which is very easy to do) you have to cycle through all your weapons again, even the hotkeys are disabled when in a vehicle. WHY?.  3. Having to mash A to sprint when using a controller; just let me hold the damn button! You also have to mash left mouse/A to respawn faster in online. I mean Why would you NOT want to respawn faster? Just let us respawn faster by default, there is literally NO reason not to.  4. Unable to sell an apartment/garage without purchasing a new one, Alot of people have a property that they never used because of this.  5. Social Club isn't bad, but it really only exists for the novelty of being in a crew, and is necessary to play just single player. It's nowhere near as bad as GFWL though.  6. If you are already in a free roam session and want to enter invite only session, you have to exit to single player first.  Other than that however, the game is excellent. It introduced and brought back nice features that were absent in GTA IV, such as the minigun, tanks, fighter jets and customising your character's appearance.",

This game's graphics has always been quite good, for the Xbox 360, the Xbox One, and of course PC, (these are the only platforms I've bought it on, excluding PS3.) as well as the online community has been great the whole time. Of course there are a few bad people out there, but if you get into a good lobby, the good SEVERELY outweighs the bad. The game's controls are great and it isn't hard to get used to. The singleplayer story is awesome, as well as adding the ability to play as more than one character, and the ability to choose your own ending.  The game is constantly pumping out new and awesome DLCs that keep the online experience fresh and awesome, as well as the main online missions that came with GTA Online when it came out are also awesome, and the apartments and Heists are great.  They've also added customisable apartments and 'Stilt Apartments' (A.K.A Houses) which is pretty cool.  Cars are cool and are a main element in the game, the fact that they keep bringing out more and more is really cool and makes races and custom missions really fun.  Basically, Grand Theft Auto V is a fun game that most likely won't get old until close to the next installment in the series' release, and if you think you'll want it, I definitley recommend buying it. (Take it from the guy who bought it four times.)   Overall Rating: 9.2/10 [Just minor issues like toxic online players that won't stop pestering. Doesn't happen all the time, but still happens.]",

As a result, cheating is an issue and is harder to address. You're connecting to players: a player in Asia will have a terrible connection to you, causing their character (and NPC assets that have/could interact with them) to glitch around and lag to you.  - On occaison you will disconnect from the other players in the session, kicking you into your own lobby. Yes, this can happen while playing with friends.  - Alt + F4 does not hard-crash the game (like it should). It puts you into a pause menu asking you to confirm you want to quit.  - If you get shot at in an online lobby, and you are in the pause menu, it kicks you out of the pause menu, which can be irritating when trying to change settings/leave a lobby in which you are being spawnkilled. - 'Free' DLC: It's blocked by a paywall of ingame money. Rockstar has made over $500 million off of the in-game microtransactions. The newer cars they've added with pricetags of $2.5m ingame cost an equivalent of $40 USD. The Finance and Felony content update requires you to have a CEO office (min price of $1m ingame) and a warehouse (~$200k iirc). - Most of the future content updates are gta online only. New supercars, lowriders, only exist in online.   With that being said, the singleplayer game is worth the $60 on its own.",

I first owned it on my PS3 - but since the next gen releases that have of course made their way to steam, it has truly become one of my favourite games of all time.  I don't want to ramble on for too long, talking about the game has be done so often, and YouTube is a great source for witnessing the experiences that can be had with this game.  Personnally, I reccomend this game for its totally professional and truly playful cynicism. Everything from the storyline plot, to the inside jokes and excellent portrayal of radio and all the excellent in-game company names that mock those in real life.   The online experience just gets better and better also. Alone or with friends, it's truly entertaining, and the PC offers the most potential out of services such as Creator and the Rockstar Editor. The Heist missions do require communication, but frequently the players you'll encounter are sociable and willing to talk. If not, just go to Ammu-Nation and start a little war in Los Santos. It's equally as rewarding.  Seriously, what a game.",

It represents a refinement of everything that GTA 4 brought to the table five years ago. It’s technically more accomplished in every conceivable way, but it’s also tremendously ambitious in its own right. No other world in video games comes close to this in size or scope, and there is sharp intelligence behind its sense of humour and gift for mayhem. It tells a compelling, unpredictable, and provocative story without ever letting it get in the way of your own self-directed adventures through San Andreas.  It is one of the very best video games ever made.  Grand Theft Auto 5 is a masterpiece of a game, and the PC version is the best way to experience it. Its sprawling yet meticulously detailed map is the high bar to which all other open-world games aspire, and it’s incredibly dense with excellent content. With so much to do, explore, and play with, both in single-player and multiplayer, plus great creative tools, it’s truly amazing on multiple levels.",

Hell, I couldn't even find out how to leave GTA Online, and I had to force it closed with task manager :/  2- PVP in Free Roam is extremely shallow. Get MG, get fast car, spray from car. If not, get spammed from car, die.  Shame, if you had to actually aim to shoot from a car in third person this game would be a much more fun and skillful pvp experience.  3- Dear god, the law enforcement system in GTA online is atrocious.

            "review_text": "Finally GTA IV has come out.   Now this is a great game, it does however have it's pros and cons. I wasen't really hyped about this game after about a month when it originally released. The release dates for the PC version kept being pushed back and the online was having it's fair share of issues. However when the time came for the PC version I grabbed one to play with friends and I thought it was worth the buy.  The pros: The game features, in my own opinion, a great story filled with humor and good chracter development. The chracters in this game are some of the best out of the whole series I think and they really kept me engaged with the story/single player. The nest big thing was the city for me, the city kept me engaged and hooked from the start of the game. I felt like the character was realy a part of the city during the campaign and the AI was decent enough to give you a feel of immersion. The graphics are good as well as the effects. The first person mode was also a BIG plus for me, something new to try and have to say it really makes points of the game very interesting and fun. The weapons are nice and offer a decent variety.   Now the cons; My first biggest problem with this game is how Rockstar handles things. By that I mean having to use Rockstar social to use this game is a little annoying and the reviews I have been reading about simple mods at times getting people banned and support from Rockstar being very weak does not give me much confidence. The next big thing I think people should know before buying is that NO NEW HEISTS HAVE BEEN PLANNED SO FAR from what I have read. I feel Rockstar is really being lazy when it comes to content and some of these heists as well as, the next con point, dealing with the hackers of the game. Instead of banning people, or letting their software ban people, for simple mods they should be banning people who are hacking and making the online experience ♥♥♥♥♥♥ for others.   In the end GTA IV is a solid title in the GTA series even with its flaws. I would recommend this game to my friends and others, however I wouldn't recommend it for full price. Why? Well for starters this is what, the games third release? Plus with this release there really isn't any new content from the original release which was a pretty good time ago. I would recommend waiting for a deal before grabbing this game, but I do recommend this game if you are a fan of sandbox games or a fan of previous titles of the series or Saints Row.",

I have yet to figure out Self Radio, but I will figure that out tomorrow.  There were slight multiplayer issues at launch, but that's to be expected. After about an hour they were quickly solved and I had no issues afterwards. All in all, a very solid launch. Much better than the 360/PS3 launch, and the PS4/XB1 launch. I played about 3 hours with my friends on multiplayer, doing impromptu races and exploring all the new graphics settings and new items. It was incredibly fun. We have yet to do heists, but I cannot wait!  If you liked Grand Theft Auto V on the previous or next gen consoles, I highly recommend the PC version, the ultimate version.",

I feel guilty to say in both cases it was actually kinda of fun floating above Los Santos in car with two other dudes on mics taken on a crazy free-roam ride with one.  That all said, the heists you perform, the progression and customization of your character when you play online - paired with GTAs whacky and crazy sequences of mayhem with others - is great.  I know GTAV didn't go on summer sale, and instead Rockstar opted to retain the price give you $200,000 starting off cash if you did buy it during the sumer sale as model. Honestly I don't find that to be a big deal, R* didn't want GTAV to be on the summer sale. And so isn't worth the negative reveiw as a game.

When i first got the game i couldnt drive a vehicle without such bad lag and stuttering the game waas unplayable. After some researching i realised that there were new 'BETA' drivers for AMD which wouldnt show up on my autodetection software for auto updating my drivers. A quick google of 'AMD 15.4 BETA DRIVERS' will help you get that fixed. As my game does now run superbly. (after i have made a few changes to settings)  NVIDIA have also released a 'GTA V READY DRIVER'  Now im no computer guru, and i dont have the best setup ever. Id like to think of my computer as a good PC, kinda a bench mark for alot of Gaming PC's .. Its a couple years old now, but features an i7 processor, and x2 AMD READON 7850's ... So its not exactly a rust bucket.   I have noticed (this seems to be more of a game engin error) rendering issues, mainly when driving fast. The game sort of coughs and splutters a bit and i get drops from 60-80fps all the way down into the 30's for a good few seconds. Which is a significant drop and can be noticed, alot.   Have some hope guys, rockstar have done a very good job and im sure they will get this issue fixed, as a few on my friends have the same issue. **THE GAME IS STILL VERY PLAYABLE, JUST STAY AWAY FROM RACES (if you have this issue)**  [GENERAL COMMENTS] Im still suprised at how the the game runs using a mouse and keyboard, the driving especially is very well done. Other GTA's has a very clunky feel if you didnt use a controller. But not on here folkes. Also I love the shooting when using a mouse, it feels soo natural with me being a FPS player.  [The Online] ooooh the online. Fantastic. Im sure you know by now what can be done online so i wont bore you. But it is so fun (when playing with buddies) The servers are a little bit 'DeSynchy' but nothing horrid.   [SINGLEPLAYER] This is definately a game for those who have loved watching the Evolution of GTA, ever since the birds eye view days, right up to where GTA IV left us. You may be thinking, 'Other than GFX being updated, what does this offer thats new, in a singleplayer aspect?' Truthfully, not a hell of alot. The only feature that i can think of my self that is 100% new is the character swapping, how you have multiple characters as part of the story line and you can swap to any character whilst doing pretty much anything. Oh, apolagies the first person feature too. So, first person. Truthfully for me a bit of a let down, you can tell its a feature added into a thirdperson game, mainly the FOV, but also the general feel you get. Its hard to explain, but it just doesnt feel like a modern FIRST PERSON VIEW experience. Now i havent completed the story line, or even got very far into it due to my social and private time being destroyed by the addictive nature of the multiplayer, but its looking like this could be a very strong fun, durable 'campaign'.

And now I'm ♥♥♥♥♥♥ with my cousin because had some nolife days :P  The game is just brutal, the world, the characters, the day to day life, all the details and what you can do.  This is a really known game, so everyone should now how to expect from rockstar and GTA series.   Pros:  Graphics: The graphics are just perfect. The buildings, the vehicles, the ocean, the streets are breathtaking. Sound: Marvellous.. In the way that you're passing by someone in the street and you listen them taling in the cellphone or arguing with someone else. The sound when you're driving or, if you're more a quite guy, when you're in the mountains and hear the eagles, the ocean, you walking in the sand. Online: It's a great world, with lot of things to do, lot of missions, lot of mods and, since the game is just to complete, being just there jogging, driving or catch a cab (already did that from the airport to paloma bay).  All the adrenaline that game gives to you makes you to play more and more. In story mode, when you've missions with an addicted guy that loves to jump from planes with motorcycles, parachuttes, jumping from buildings with a parachutte and land in a truck, you'll feel the adrenaline that GTA has.  I strongly recommend this one, it's a MUST HAVE game.",

Interestingly another: this is an adult a game based on the boyish emotions, and therein lies its charm. This is partly why GTA can not escape the violence. And this is a very cruel game (not the first, and obviously not the last in Rockstar), childishly cruel game, psychopathic violent. And naturalness of all it looks like a psychopathic character with complaints of severe childhood - nailed to the floor with wooden toys and other fatal trouble. He did not have those memories of the 'machine', well, you know, when it is such a great-looking, and it sits a plastic driver: maybe Batman can, Spider-Man, or maybe just the driver. When it was possible to take her hand and go out for an adventure: the carpet turned into an imaginary sun city, like the one from the mysterious film bellied TV. In this fantasy we play, and that fantasy alien - it is for the better. At the end of history show us allegorically statistics in a form of a psychiatrist. The conclusion from the reference, in general, the same - childhood was difficult.",

Well done Rockstar,you earned yourself a very well made cookie for your efforts put into this port. :)  Final Verdict 10/10 for being the best port.",

The frame rate is buttery smooth, dynamic lighting, highly detailed textures and so on make GTA V feel alive and begging to be explored. So far I'm only a little ways into the story but it already is engaging and I'm excited to see how it all unfolds without feeling burdened by it.

GTA Online was awesome for the first few months, RIGHT before all the cheaters started moving in. Don't give them the glory of calling the Modders or Hackers, as that would imply there is some skill or intellect involved, these people are no more than monkeys sh*tting all over the place simply for the lulz. The worst part is that there is 0 moderation from Rockstar, and the punishment system is total d*ck.   I have a simple cost effective fix for you Rockstar - DEDICATED SERVERS. Let them operate the framework of Rockstar (ie no true sandbox) but allow player moderation. Yes you will get people banning others for no reason as with all games, but its better than having cheaters do worse things for no reason. Also, you can avoid servers you dont like, as opposed to a randomised 'Pick A New Session' option.  Dont get me started on the epic level &amp; cash grind, which really crushes the soul of the game ( especially when you see some knob on level 999 fly past in a flying saucer that he cheated for). Another way this should have been done is all major weaponry and prime vehcile unlocks (ie one from each category) is availble by the time you reach level 20 (which is hours and hours of grinding anyway), with further levels suited as prestige - ie unlocking new horns, colour schemes, heck even renovations for houses.  Online could have been truly brilliant, but unfortunately Rockstar has sh*t the bed.",

However, if it goes on sale, or you get some buds to play it, then you may as well go ahead.    #pcmasterrace  So now that about half the people on the internet have pushed the 'Not Helpful' button, here's my review of GTA V.  Its ok.  It looks nice, can run on anything better than a toaster oven, and has the widest array of options I've seen in a game similar to it. The story mode is fun, though drags on a bit in tedium at times, and is full of cheese (not always a bad thing.)  Then I tried the multiplayer.  I will say this, it can be enjoyable, but as a social introvert with little friends (WHOA SELF LOATHING HOHOHO), it can be a little bland without company.  So with that in mind, I finish the review with this little tidbit:  Do your homework, watch a bit of gameplay, and see if some buds have it. Also, wait for it to go on sale, like the smart person I know you are (seeing as nobody reads these anyways.)",

I did play previous versions of the game tho, The online is absolutely revolutionary, and the story mode is awesome if you're a more completionist type of gamer, but if you're more like me, you'll think it's more on the average side. The online is best enjoyed with friends tho, because posibilites are endless but the best parts of the online can only be enjoyed with friends. Be prepared to spend loads of hours (or real money) if you want the best cars tho, nowadays the game is filled with new stuff to buy and it will take some time to buy the stuff you want... The game is gorgeous graphically, but it runs on a potato thanks to the god tier port. Definitely worth a buy. Especially when you can get it quite cheap with a $1,250,000 online shark card for prettty much no extra cost. (Yes, that's the only reason I got it for PC, I'll get a GPU someday tho) 9.4/10, Online is the most fun online experience on any open world game, but the story is a bit lacking and the single player is best enjoyed by completionists.

I have transferred my account over from xbox and it is very simple to do if you have played this on console. you just have to do the prologue. It has violence and vulgar language, etc in it, but if i had to give this a rating i would give it a 8/10. the only negatives are hackers and the language and violence.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.",

Or you could just do the idiotic thing i have done and give in to microtransactions. You want a yacht? you better pay 120 dollars irl for in game cash. You want that office? you better chuck in 100 dollars for that in game cash for it. Its actually irritating when you think about it considering how many microtransactions and how much grinding you are needing to do. For gta 6 i hope they improve this so the microtransactions are more optional. For example have missions and hiests give you more money in the game.

The Single-Player has a fun campaign with some heists to complete. Each heist has the silent way or the loud way to do it, making it adaptable to your play style. After completing the campaign the Single-Player can get boring, but the game makes up for that with its amazing modding community. Single-Player mods for this game can range from being a Police Officer to surviving a tsunami or Apocalypse. The Multiplayer is very fun, especially if you have friends to play with. The game may be riddled with Shark Card microtransactions, but you do not need to buy them for the game to be fun. Alot of people complain that most online players are hackers, but Rockstar have resolved most of that problem very well. I know people who have used trainers for money online, and they have told me all of their trainers have stopped working in recent patches. There may be the odd skilled hacker who found a loophole, but there are definitely less hackers than there were. I have put over 150 hours into this game. I would have put more into it, but I did not do the campaign myself, I downloaded a save file. This is due to me completing it on PS3 and PS4.   Single Player 8/10 Modding 10/10 Online 9/10 ",

Im pretty sure I cant play my single player unless I reinstall it (for the 3rd time), just because I was innocently trying to use the Iron Man mod.  I find the campaign to be very very fun. Not the most amazing campaign i've ever played (that goes to Uncharted 2, or MGS4) but it definitely has some great moments, and set pieces.  I have no complaints with the online, except for all the trolls. I have run into about 7 or 8 modders (good and bad) online so far, in which only about 2 REALLY ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off. Besides that, there is a HUUUGGEEE clothing selection, despite the fact that there are only like 2 backwards hats which is.. odd... Alot of updates for the online continue to make it fun and fresh (FREE UPDATES BTW) and hackers get banned relatively quick.  The addition of FIRST PERSON is DEFINITELY a plus. Very quick and easy to switch to, and also extremely enjoyable.    This game stays within the epic GTA formula, but also reinvents in a big way.  TLDR; 9/10 Too much GTA",

            "review_text": "TL:DR edition. Single-player is memorable and really fun, the online is a catastrophe. Connection issues, hackers, players that will stalk and murder you continuously, etc etc etc.   Grand Theft Auto speaks for itself. Each new installment gets better and better. GTAV is no exception, it is definitely a great time, especially the single-plyaer campaign. That's where the compliments end for this game.  The big new thing with GTA V is the official online mode. Allowing you to play with friends and randoms from all over the globe. This was a huge step up from the previous installments, but unfortunately the online is far from perfect.  I have so many issues with the online I'm not sure if I can list them all. Lets start with the load time. I have the gamne installed on a solid state drive and it still takes a bit to load the Rockstar Social club, the game then get into the online, find a server and get me into it and load in. And that's if I can stay connected. My friends and I have so much trouble trying to stay IN them game, we spend more time loading in then playing, and this is especially infuriating during a heist. If one player leaves during a heist, then the heist is over, the progress you made is gone, and the money you spent is gone. I have no issues in multiplayer games, a hiccup here and there perhaps, but no major issues, except GTA V Online. Sometimes if you're disconnected the game will have to load up the single-player and plop you down in there, wasting more time for you to have to load back into the online mode and pray you can stay in.  Some of the jobs and modes can be quite fun (again if you can stay connected), but getting to them requires going to the main menu and selecting Online, Jobs, Rockstar Created, etc etc etc. It seems lazily thrown on in my opinion. You know in Team Fortress 2 for example, all the online modes and game types are easily listed out. You can get to a certain server, certain mode, etc with a few clicks, and its quite easy to navigate. Out of all of my friends I'm the only one who took the time to learn GTA V's online navigation. It's not the simplest, but it does I suppose. Oh and if you want to play your online character in your own server? Oh what a nightmare THAT is to load up.  But why would you? IT'S ONLINE. If you die, it costs money. If you blow up certain cars, it costs money. Lose your wanted level, call in a vehicle? Money money money. You can get money with jobs and missions (again if you can stay connected long enough) but with paying for all of that, your cars, guns, ammo, armor, upgrades, etc... you won't have much cash. And of course, being online means other players targetting and killing you for.... no reason. So if you want a relaxing fly around, or just to drive and pick up a friend is potentially a stalker coming after and killing you.. over.. and over... and over... and over.  I know what you're thinking... Just kill them. One time I did. I was so fed up that I hid and waited. The player rounded the corner in his car, I threw a sticky bomb and detonated it, killing him and his vehicle instantly. And just as instantly 20,000 was taken from my bank acocunt to pay for his car... Wow... Thanks. And the way it works is when you die, you spawn near by... So within seconds he was back on top of me trying to murder me. It's a disaster. You can become invincible, by paying money and having to keep doing it every 15 minutes.... But that's not very fun now is it? And when you finally find a good server or a server with your friends and you start to unwind, you'll be kicked out and sent to single-player.  Overall the single-player is quite fun and another great addition to the franchise, but the online is just a disaster. Connection issues, navigation nightmares (some invites are sent in Rockstar Club, some are sent via the phone, both forcing you to stop and become a target while you accept an invite). The online needs refinement, and then it needs more refinement on top of that. Gang attacks at 2 of the three air strips? Come on. If I want my plane, I want my plane, I don't want to go murdering NPC's, wait for the congrats screen to come up, how many i killed, the headshots, etc. Just give me the plane so I can go do what I want. It seems I'm more fighting and struggling to make the game do what I want, rather than doing what I want and having fun.  OH.... AND THE LAST THING. If I make a lobby for a race, heist, whatever THEN KEEP ME THE DAMN HOST. It's INFURIATING to be racing, having full control over what cars can be used, how many laps, etc and then suddenly you're in a lobby for a regular mission and you lost host privileges. HOW DID I END UP I THAT MODE?! Why did I somehow lose the host position!? Infuriating to say the least.  I would still recommend it for the single-player but the online? Naw... Maybe the next installment will fix the issues, the many many issues. Until then steer clear and play single-player, where you'll more than likely get kicked and forced into anyhow.",

Cheaters and Modders. The current state of GTA Online is broken. Just about every lobby is filled with hackers and modders. Finding randoms to befriend and have fun with is just about impossible now. The only way I can truly enjoy this game is if I host my one invite-only session or I could wait untill mods from private sessions or deticated servers are released if they actually are in the making.

It features seriousness and sillyness- ranging from a nice drive around the city to being carried in a limo by a helicopter to the top of the biggest mountain.  The missions and heists are a lot better when you are able to use voice communication, my crew and I use Skype every time we play and it makes everything nice and easy, with quicker response times by us.  There are a couple of bugs that I have noticed - objects popping into view just as you hit it, not being able to move after completing a mission / heist for a period of time, and randomly losing cars that you spent your hard earned (in game) cash on.  Overall, I would reccomend this game, whether you're a casual player or a try-hard.",

The only thing that kind of Bugs me are the car mechanics, specifically the suspension. when youre going at a reasonable speed, and hit a curb, the car jerks to ther height of teh curb, which is exactly the opposite of what a car will actually do in real life, at high speeds, hitting a curb, unless your suspension is super stiff and your ground clearance is slim to none, the car wouldnt jerk upwards, just the wheels would jerk upwards, not the entire car. and another side note, why cant modern day game developers make the rim movement of cars realistic, i mean i guess its to show off your rims at even high speeds, but its really urealistic. The only game I HAVE SEEN PERSONALLY that follows the actual light mechanics of moving wheels is Midnight Club : Los Angeles Remix (otherwise known as the PSP version.) but thats not as much of a tick on my back as the suspension. This is supposed to be a hyper-realistic game, and fixing the suspension would be a HUGE improvement. I STILL LOVE THIS GAME, YEARS AHEAD OF ITS TIME, LOVE IT WOULD RECOMMEND TO ANYONE, ESPECIALLY PC VERSION BECAUSE PCMASTERRACE THATS WHY",

What I think of GTA V is that the single player was fun and I lovr the fact that you control 3 different characters, but for me personally I would make the game a bit longer and give more freedom to when it come to planning a heist. I am currently busy playing GTA V Online. I am only about 2 weeks busy online now and one of the firts things I picked up that I would have added toe the online version is that you have the ability toe do a atm transfer of money from your bank account to one of your friends of crew members. I would also loved if you had the ability to buy vehicles and clothing that you can give to your friends and crew or even just for thr people helping you run your businesses.

            "review_text": "Ive owned this game on two platforms. Recently i bought it again. This time during the summer sale.   First thing ill say is the multiplayer is rather grindy. Too have a really awesome car it will take a good 1-2 weeks or so (depending on if you wanna spend atleast 2+ whole days grinding missions and what car you are saving up for) for people with limited time to play. Although, you dont need these really fancy cars, helicopters, planes and now luxury yachts. A basic car, few weapons, abit of armour and friends can really bring out the best of what this game has to offer.  MONEY MAKING TIP: This wont make you money upfront but it can be worth it. Buy a CEO building maze bank being the cheapest (1mil). If playing solo grind these two missions in the 'CEO Work section'. Headhunter and sightseer. These missions are fairly easy. Especially if you have an Armoured Karuma or helicopter.  As a side note i really like how theyve made there servers. Having public lobby's, private lobby's (so on.) Theres nothing better than being in a public lobby and watching a truck being chased down by two turreted-limos! (and maybe a jet)  As for singleplayer, i think theyve done a good job developing the characters and then fitting their personalities into the game. The missions are fun, dont follow a predictable path and can be quite challenging at times. The story line can be short.   I would also like to point out that all the updates have been free. Stunt races free, heists free, all the updates and DLC has been free. No paid ones whatsoever.   NOTE:  Most of the reviews ive seen have been complaining about bans, or to be more detailed, false banning. If you encounter this issue (which i personally havent) I would suggest contacting Rockstar's support teams and resolving your issue. If you have been banned, its rather accidental (and therefore can be resolved). Or for a reason.",

Cons: High Level players such as me have a sudden urge to drive like were having diarrhea in the car and kill random people like were on roids, Reason for this (for me) will be below  Online has a low P2W (Pay To Win) percentage being more consisted of LU2W (Level Up to Win)  Apparently random bans have been made often in this game but I have Not got one (Not really a con maybe people be mad cuz they be cheating cash?)  GOLDEN RULE&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Money is easy to loss if your enjoying yourself, and making money is not balanced and more of a boring chore, making Heists the only valuable option.  BIG PROBLEM: People leave, disconnect or ♥♥♥♥ off of Heist session your in therefore rendering everthing useless and sending you back to the game lobby where you will wait 10 min to have a new pullout player again.  It becomes boring when you dont have money, most players at this point have rebelled and got Recovery Modded accounts or are enabling Godmode from their pc whatever it would be, rendering them Banned in the next patch or even sooner due to money spawning which is logged.

Having some nice little, online multiplayer banter with the squad one fateful night. we were doing some missions and what have you, generally on that day to day grind, now one of my friends was a massive sweat, and played a ♥♥♥♥ load on the PS3, so when he transfered his save, he had a missile launcher, we completed a mission and were left on a ♥♥♥♥ off great hill in the middle of nowhere, i was getting like maybe 25-30FPS at best, even though there was barely anything to even try and render.  Now my realm 5 mate turns around with this hot little RPG and says something along the lines of, Hey, watch this, and shoots me square in the face with the RPG. After respawning i had a total of 10FPS and could never play the game again.

Gameplay: Are you joking of course the gameplay is amazing it's GTA, if you are new to this market after 80 hours of grinding it may seem repetitive. But if you're someone from the community you will like it.  Open World: GTA is known for it's contrebutions to open world, its not jam-packed like skyrim but it still is extreamly fun to just skrew around in the open world!",

So for me singleplayer is negative one but for others it is fine. I hope I will sometimes pass singleplayer. Gta Online is the best side of Gta. I spent all hours in Gta Online playing races, heists, driving around city or the most likely to me tuning cars. There is nothing better than driving around with your friends in tuned cars, but if you want to chill you need to go in 'friends only server' because in public server kids must kill you. Kids are negative side of this game. If you don't like their king (youtuber), you are in big trouble. They are flaming around, killing each other but 'king' is quiet and proud of 'minions'. So as you can see I hate kids in this game. If you don't want to go in private server you can activate passive mode and turn off voice chat (thanks Rockstar for these options).  Optimization is well. It's running very good on low hardware and still looks good. On maxed out graphics game looks awesome. So as you read Gta V can be cancer but also can be good. Enjoy!?",

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

Wow, where do I even start with this masterpiece of a Grand Theft Auto game.. well for good measure I will break it out in seperate pieces.  : : : : : STORY : : : : : After just recently completing the story mode for a fourth time (Two times on PS3, once on PS4 and now on PC), and eventually will complete one last time, but with the mouse and keyboard. I am just so in love with the storyline for this game, it is so well-acted and I wouldn't really say well-written since this is just a simple plot, but still though it's a really awesome storyline for such a quality Grand Theft Auto game. From the main characters to the secondary and minor characters, (Haven't met all of them, but met a great bunch of them) all of them are just very loveable characters, I love all of them, but the one that stays in my heart will always be Michael, he's now my number two protagonist in GTA, number one will be Niko Bellic from IV, don't get me wrong, but Niko has a much better storyline that's connected to him. I love this storyline so much..  : : : : : GAMEPLAY : : : : : Rockstar really changed up the gameplay from GTA IV, alot of nice improvements and changes, with the First Person perspective added in with the PS4 and Xbone versions at the time, it really does bring in the immersive feel of the beautiful map of this game. With them raising the framerate to 60FPS, It is so much more smoother and it brings in the immersive feel of the game so much more than it was on the PS3 and the PS4. I really love all of the weapons, but I wish to see some more unique weapons aswell, such as the Musket and the Rail Gun and a couple more. All of the types of vehicles in this game, there's alot of vehicles.. I wish they brought back the PMP 600 from IV.. That car was beast.. Please Rockstar, bring it back? &lt;3  : : : : : GRAPHICS AND PORT : : : : : The first time I believe I ever talk about how the game looks.. So, of course the game looks abso-lutely stunning at all angles (I was playing through the game and playing Online on High, eventually will be max settings and will beat the story, again.. lol) The draw distance is awesome and it feels much more immersive than ever since it's running at 60FPS.. which brings me down to breaking down the port of this magnificent game. Rockstar, I was unsure of what you were going to do for this port at first, but then since you guys took extra time to polish it and everything, of course I got a little impatient, but I was trusting you, and look at what you did.. You did an outstanding job with bringing this, yet I say again, masterpiece to PC. Thank you for upgrading to 60FPS, since it is necessary for a GTA PC port which helps to bring in the immersion to playing in a GTA game. Of course, it's not perfect, I tend to have little drops here and there, but it's so much more smoother now..  : : : : : GTA ONLINE : : : : : I love playing Online so much, it is so much more expanded than GTA IV's, of course.. I have to admit, I was really impatient for waiting for Heists, but I got through it, When I saw the trailer, I was so ready to play Heists. But let's face it, Heists are just ONE big thing to do in GTA Online, but honestly, there are limitless things you can do in GTA Online, and now you can record it with the Rockstar Editor! You can make AWESOME movies! If there's nothing to do.. that what are you thinking about then? Hm? You just have to be creative and think of all of the awesome gameplay features, the vehicles, everything Rockstar has incorporated into this game.. Like I said before.. limitless things you can do!!!  : : : : : CONCLUSION : : : : : I believe I have covered everything as possible, so here is my last and final statement about this game. Rockstar has done an outstanding job with the game by itself, incorporated more amazing stuff in their DLCs, bringing us unlimited things to do in GTA Online, it looks mind-blowingly amazing and feels so much better due to a higher framerate, Of course, look at this review, that's alot of words saying that I love this game, but I could go on forever and EVER talking about how great this game is.. Only thing I will say of what you should play on to enjoy it the most on, is definitely the PC version, Rockstar my last words to you, is this, Thank you so much for treating this masterpiece right on PC, and you have stole my heart for making such an incredible Grand Theft Auto game.. I can't wait to see what you establish in GTA VI, here's hoping it's in Vice City!  RATING: 10/10, I would want to go higher.. screw it.. 999,999,999,999,999/10  Last words: In regardless of how much it is, I would reccomend getting it on a sale if you have played it before, but if it is going to be your first time playing it, it is worth full-price (in my opinion), but, do what you want, you won't be mistaken. Also, I have crashed on this game in the beginning, but I have found a solution from someone and solved it, if you guys are crashing and don't know what to do, check if you have a plsapp64.dll in C:\\Windows\\System32, get rid of it, it solved my crashing and it should solve yours.",

Those parts aside let me give you my experience with the game. I played the original GTA V on Xbox 360 the day it came out, and followed up playing GTA Online when it was released later. Both games (might as well be two seperate games) are fantastic. The Story mode is rich with excellent dialogue and amazing characters, you never know what you will hear next or what might happen. This is a game of satire, if satire is something you are not a fan of or hate crude and vulgur humor this game will never sit well with you. If you are okay with satire prepare for it to be cranked up to 11 as this is the biggest amount of satirical humor you can find. No one is safe from Rockstars plethora of jokes and jabs.  The actual game play itself is beyond solid, compared to the original GTA IV made on the same engine 7 years ago, this game stands tall. The driving is a tiny bit arcady but it is much more realistic and responsive than the sluggish and oil slicked tires of GTA IV driving. Shooting is much more solid as well, targets snap to much more fluidly with more precise control on where you wish to aim as opposed to GTA IVs snap and spastic dragging of the reticule back to the center of mass.  Flying is also solid and even much better than it has ever been before, vehicles feel like they have weight to them while flying and take realistic damage. Specific parts of vehicles or aircraft can be targeted to cause precision damage, such as shooting off the rotors of helicopters or taking out the engine of a jet. Speaking of flying, there is turbulence now that is reduced by your flying skill which gives incentive to level it as well as enjoy the more responsive flying style, planes can even stall if they fly straight up.  Customization in this game is huge, each character can wear a vast array of clothing and haircut or tattoo options and every vehicle can be customized with unique colors. Compared to GTA IV it's laughable how drastic the difference. In GTA IV you couldn't even customize cars, you could get their color changed but it would be randomized what color you got so you had to repeat the process needless and there was nothing else. That's it. GTA V has options a plenty, from performance enchancing to many cosmetic changes as well as protective such as armor and bulletproof tires.  Overall Single Player for GTA V is an amazing experience, and with the new first person mode, replaying the campaign and just using FPM is an entirely different experience. GTA Online is vast environment with so much content that I can't even cover everything I want to say about it here, if you are truly interested in GTA Online go check out my guide 'Duo Vandal's Ultimate Guide to GTA Online' on the Guide section and give it a rating if you enjoyed it. I've been playing GTA Online to this day since 2013 and it's the best Online experience you can have.",

            "review_text": "Well, there it is: the greatly anticipated, three-times-delayed 'port' of GTA V for PC. After a 2 hour (59GB) download and a 15 minute unencrypting/preallocating/unpacking session on one of the fastest SSDs out there at the moment, everything went smooth from thereon and I was ready to jump into the game (at 1AM). After doing a couple of missions in the single player and familiarizing myself with the controls (which are really smooth, except for when flying a plane...), I decided to check out GTA Online...  8 hours later, I noticed it was 9 o'clock in the morning and I had to already have been in the office... Obivously I 'worked at home' that day, as this is honestly one of the most addicting games I've played in a long while! As anyone probably knows already, and as anyone can tell from all the other reviews, this is definitely a game to get! I'd like to add some negative points to this review section however. Some of them might be fixed in the future, and all of them should definitely not withold you from buying the game, but it's good to know there are still some issues with this game.   One of the few negative things I can say about this game right now, is that GTA Online sometimes literally takes 3-4 minutes to load up, and this 'loading period' also happens when you disconnect from a job (or get kicked from it, or failed to connect to it...). It also seems the game stops loading (or loads terribly slowly) when you ALT-TAB out of the game during the loading screen (I like to do this and do something else while the game loads), so you really have to be on the loading screen for it to continue loading. I've missed out the start of a job (and thus got disconnected) because I ALT-TABbed to desktop for ~30 secs while joining a heist... When I tabbed back to the game, the heist had already started without me (as my friend, who was also in this heist, told me) and I was stuck on an infinite loading screen that I could not get out of.  Also, joining another player's session can sometimes take very long. When there is no free slot in that session, you'll be asked to be placed in a queue, but this doesn't work very often either. Somehow, I've ended up singing in the shower more times than actually getting in the game with my friends when I clicked 'Join Game'.   Other minor bugs I noticed: when browsing the web (on your virtual smartphone) and clicking on a video, the video will indefinitely play and you cannot close the browser anymore, thus resulting in you having to ALT-F4 out of the game. Furthermore, flying a plane feels really wonky (aside from the turbulence, which also adds an extra difficulty factor). The plane tends to nose-dive and you seem to have to correct this continuously by pressing numpad-5 (nose up).   Other than that, this is an  amazing  game, because once you're in with your friends, all the loading time was well worth it, and I cannot think of any other multiplayer game out there right now that is this much fun to play.",

The only way that they could be telling the truth is if they truly think they were. they probably used mods on singleplayer and didnt take them out when they went online. they were cheating even if they didnt know it, rockstar's anti cheat detects these mods and bans the cheaters. it was not rockstar's fault people were being banned it was theres. All these downvotes on steam ruining the reputation are just because people were dumb and had mods on when they went to online. its there own fault they were banned. rockstar has stated YOU WILL NOT GET BANNED FOR SINGLEPLAYER MODDING, but if you have mods online you will. Rockstar has done nothing to wrong the community. Those who made bad reviews and understand they were wrong, please delete the reviews.    AAAAAAANDDDD my review of the game:::  Driving: 9/10  Shooting: 8/10  Story: 9.6/10  Flying: Most players dont like it, and would probably give it like a 3-5/10. Personally, i use the mouse flying and love it, id give it a solid 9.5/10  Character customization  Online: 6/10 not a fan of the hairs and all females look terrible.  Singleplayer: 5/10 little to nothing you can do to your character.    Is it Replayable?: For sure! I give replayability a 10/10    And here are some random questions you might be asking   What is your least favorite thing?: The Invite system is bad. so getting randoms for a heist is hard, I suggest just making a small group of friends to heist with. Aaaaaand I also dislike how most randoms you get dont listen when you talk to them and ignore everyone.  Your opinion on heist cuts?: 40/20/20/20  Worth buying a second time, for pc?: Yesssss, you get great things like the dodo and kraken, and you can show off your hatchet in melee fights B) Dont forget the great modding!! Already some awesome mods ive seen.  Favorite thing in the game? Heists.. I just did the prison heist for a second time a few minutes ago.. I loved that feeling of finishing it with my friends, and we all had a great time!  OKK now time for the total  57.1/70",

When I heard GTA V was going to come out, I was not as excited as I should have been. I wasn't hyped. I did not pay attention to their announcements or newsfeed for this upcoming release. This also had to do with how Rockstar refused to release it for PC till 2 years after it's been released on consoles. Anyhow, even knowing that I wasn't excited for the release of the PC version for this game, I went ahead and purchased it seeing that many of my friends bought it. In all honesty, it's a great game and I've been addited to it for the first 3 weeks. Eventually, my enjoyment for this game died down. GTA V Online is a sandbox game, but it does lack things to do. Plus, the hackers/scripters/modders did not help sustain the satisfaction. They actually destroyed it. From my previous experiences in GTA games, I've known that this game had cheats, so it wasn't a surprise. I did not play the campaign, but I'm going to recommend this game and it has definitely paid off my $60.",

If you don’t know yet, Grand Theft Auto V is pretty much the best game for any person (with friends) to have fun, either online or not.   Single player: Grand Theft Auto V’s single player has its’ flaws, but I still though that it was a lot better than Grand Theft Auto IVs story. Unfortunately Rockstar doesn’t update it as much as it does on Online, so this game is more centered towards those who enjoy online. Despite that, the single player is infinitely fun, and definitely a time waster, that coupled with mods is an amazing combination.   Online: Now, obviously every online game has its’ hackers and its’ cancerous players, so playing online with random players is going to be very hard. Seeing as many of the online players are either ♥♥♥♥♥, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, trollers, or 12 year olds, it’s pretty hard to have any fun or make any friends online. The online portion gives you a lot of opportunity and a lot of jobs to do, but then again you must have friends. You could own a company, so you could be your very own Fatcat, you can also own an MC and be your own president, and with that comes many other jobs and missions. Heists are very fun, but hard to play with randoms because I’m pretty sure there’s some quantum physics law that says one of the randoms has to be either ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, or with a bad internet connection, because it’s absolutely impossible to be stable while on random. It’s impossible to play more than one heist, even if you’re lucky to play one, with randoms. So unless you have dedicated friends, it’ll be very hard for you to enjoy this game.   Conclusion: Amazing game to play with friends. I recommend this to anyone with some extra cash and a semi beefy computer. P.S. If you’re cool you’re invited to add me and play if you want!",

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.",

            "review_text": "There are times when I look at Los Santos and think 'why would you even think to build that?' This is, appropriately, a thought that I often have about Los Angeles. In GTA 5's case, the tone is different: baffled wonderment as opposed to baffled, y'know, despair. Rockstar have created one of the most extraordinary game environments you will ever visit. I look at it and I wonder at the vast expense of effort required to render every trash bag in every back alley just so. I marvel at the care evident in San Andreas' gorgeous sunsets, in the way that sunglasses subtly alter the colour balance of the world, in the artfully-chosen selection of licensed music designed to accompany your experience. Everything about Los Santos demonstrates the extraordinary amount of thought and love poured into it by hundreds of developers over many years. The abiding irony of Grand Theft Auto 5 is that everybody who actually lives in Los Santos hates it there.  This is the most beautiful, expansive and generous GTA game and also, by some distance, the nastiest and most nihilistic. Rockstar went through a phase, in Bully, Grand Theft Auto IV and the sadly console-bound Red Dead Redemption, of framing their protagonists as anti-heroes. GTA 4's Niko Bellic did some terrible things, but he had a downtrodden charm that helped you like him as you piloted him through the underworld. He was surrounded by people who were larger-than-life but ultimately, beneath the surface, people. Among those people were some of Rockstar's better female characters—Kate McReary, Mallorie Bardas, The Lost and Damned's Ash Butler.  GTA V Argument  Grand Theft Auto 5 does away with all of that, deliberately but to its detriment. Its trio of protagonists occupy a city full of vapid, two-dimensional caricatures, and they flirt with that boundary themselves. Michael is a middle-aged former bankrobber, unhappily married and on the edge of a breakdown. Franklin is a young hood, purportedly principled but willing to do almost anything for money. Trevor is a desert-dwelling, meth-dealing psychopath with a homebrew morality that sits uneasily alongside his capacity for violent cruelty and sexual aggression. The campaign explores their relationship through a series of heists and misadventures as they clash with every L.A. stereotype you might imagine—the bored Beverly Hills housewife, the corrupt fed, the bottom-rung fraudster, the smug technology exec, and so on.  Against this backdrop, it's only Michael, Franklin and Trevor that appear to have any kind of internal life. I get the impression that this is deliberate, part of the game's relentless skewering of southern California and indicative of Rockstar's waning interest in romantic anti-heroes. Trevor's introduction, in particular, amounts to a particularly explicit '♥♥♥♥ you' to the characters and themes of Grand Theft Auto IV. GTA 5 is heartless in that way, and as a result I found the narrative difficult to care about. It is ambitious, well-performed, and the production values are extraordinary—but it is also derivative and brutishly adolescent, set in a world where the line between criminality and the rule of law is blurry but where it is always hilarious that somebody might be gay.  GTA V Chinatown  It's an R-rated episode of The A-Team where the 'A' stands for '♥♥♥♥♥♥♥'. The campaign's best moments come when your cigar-chomping master strategist, insane former military pilot and talented driver come together, and when you're given the power to choose how to use each of them. These heists are set-piece missions where you pick an approach and perform set-up tasks in the open world before setting out on the job itself. In the best of them, which occur later in the campaign, it really does evoke the satisfaction of having a plan come together. Perhaps you position Trevor on the high-ground with a rocket launcher, Michael on foot with a stealth approach, and Franklin in an armoured ram-raider. With a button press you can flick between the three, dynamically orchestrating a crime caper on your own terms.  It is also in these moments that Rockstar's most ambitious storytelling takes place. Your choice of character, crew, and even certain in-game actions have subtle effects on the dialogue. In an early heist, a crewmember dropped part of the score but, as Franklin, I was able to retrieve it—a side-objective that I'd set for myself but that was subsequently reflected in a later conversation between him and Michael. This is another example of Rockstar's extraordinary attention to detail, and if the rest of the campaign respected your agency in this way it might overcome its weaker moments.  GTA V Plane Chase  As it is this is a very long game with a lot of filler. There's much driving from A to B, a lot of conversations in cars, a lot of gunfights with hordes of goons who show up just to run into your gunsights over and over. It's far richer in set-piece moments than its predecessor—drug trips, aerial heists, dramatic chases—and many of these look incredible even if they're light on actual interaction. In the best examples, you soak in the atmosphere and happily ignore the fact that you're only really being asked to follow the on-screen instructions. In the worst examples—insta-fail stealth sequences, sniper missions and so on—it's harder to ignore the shackles that are placed on the player in order to preserve the game's cinematic look and feel.  I spent a lot of my time with the campaign frustrated along these lines, bored of the same mission templates that I've been playing through since GTA III and making the most of the scant opportunities to play my own way, like Franklin's refreshingly open assassination missions. Then, inevitably, I'd be doing one of those rote activities—a heavily scripted freeway chase, perhaps—when the magic of that extraordinary world would creep up on me again. It'd hit me: I'm doing 150 km/h along the Pacific Coast Highway at sunset. The rock station is playing 30 Days In The Hole by Humble Pie. It feels incredible, a collision of pop-culture, atmosphere, music and play that is unique to GTA.",

            "review_text": "Here's the thing. The method currently being used to mod isn't really what most people think of as modding. ScriptHook, is an example of DLL Assembly Code Injection, which sneaks foreign code into the process in order to provide a method for an additional payload of code to hook/modify the game process in memory.  The problem with this is that there is no way to tell what the payload is. Nor is there anyway to prevent the payload from working in only some areas of the game.  That's the point a lot of people don't understand here, we're not talking addons. We're talking DLL files that have been modified to allow a user to run ANY additional code they want and have the game accept it and execute it. There are no limits to what can be run with this and the trainer that comes as the included demonstration of scripthook is a very benign usage of the potential.  To give you an example of the dangers of allowing DLL Injected clients to connect to multiplayer servers or any other client for that matter, until recently, in Reign of Kings, hackers using the same method that scripthook uses, were using injected assembly code into DLLs to modify files on the computers of other players on the servers they connected to and in many cases, even the files on the servers themselves.  When we're talking about DLL Injection, there is no such thing as singleplayer mod or multiplayer mod. It's just foreign code being run, anywhere the user wants. The only way to prevent it is to check the integrity of the DLLs of any client on connection and cutting the connection as soon as a disprecency is found. It may seem like overkill, but the alternative is a complete loss of security for anyone using gta online.",

            "review_text": "Honestly, disregard the negative reviews...People zero-bombing a game because of a launch bug where they couldn’t play online right out the gate...Let's get one thing straight...for ANY game releasing to PC that is online, expect to no be able to reach servers the first 10-45 mins because of the HUGE overflow of players trying to do the same thing you are...That is not a reason to down vote a game because you couldn’t go online instantly.   *GAME REVIEW* This game is an amazing port. WAY better than GTA 4. The gameplay is clear, smooth, and pretty much flawless with updated drivers. Single player is the same as next gen, but way more detailed. There is so much more detail in the world around you. The textures, shadows, and sun shafts are simply jaw-dropping. If you have a good gaming computer, buy this NOW. If you don’t, stay with console, otherwise you will end up like the other negative reviewers.  *END GAME REVIEW*  Another thing about people complaining about the 'unpacking'...I don’t know what you're talking about. I didn't have to wait for an “unpack” at all. I literally preloaded, downloaded the patch that dropped release hour, and hit play and it worked. I guess for the people giving 'Pissy Reviews' on the unpacking, get a better HDD/SSD and CPU and quit your complaining.  For the people saying 'The game isn’t launching.' or, 'OMG i have LONG load times'...once again, get a better computer. Don't complain about load times when you're playing on an $800 or less 'Gaming' computer. My load times were a minute tops to get into single player and about 2-3 mins to find a populated lobby.   For the people complaining about the Social Club, just...shut your mouth...it's Rockstar, they are a Company, aka business, that is here to make money. Just like every other company you get mad at because you have to use their launchers or interfaces to play their games, they are businesses there to make money. Plain and simple.   For those crying about low frames at HD res...update your damn drivers before whining. Nvidia released an update prior to launch, and AMD just released a beta patch for theirs 6 hours ago... Go ahead and download them. ALSO, if you're expecting to be able to play this at 1080p@60FPS with MAX settings on a GPU that is below the recommended card....just please...shush...please...  Let me tell you a little secret to having a good gaming experience and have little to no errors with this game...spend more than $1000 on your computer...if you don't, you shouldn’t even buy the game...  Here is an example of mine (Which is nowhere near the best): --------------------------------------------- i7 4790k - $360 ASUS Hero Vii - $250 Corsair Dominator 16GB 2133 - $225 AMD HD7970 - $500 when i bought it OCZ Agility 3 SSD 240GB - $230 Antec 850W Plat PSU- $300 Corsair H105 - $110 ASUS 1080p 144Hz monitor - $350 -------------------------------------------- TOTAL = $2,325 (And I didn't even add the case, bluray drive, another SSD, and two other HDDs)  That runs this at 1080p@60FPS with optimized max settings  IF your computer is any less than that, and you complain about FPS issues, long load times, unpacking, errors, or whatever else you want to zero bomb for, get out of the PC gaming world and go back to console please.",

Said smoothness is slightly roughened up by the online servers, but I can look past that. I love this game, and everything about it.

I think GTA V is the best so far as there's so much going on you can easily become hooked and totally immersed. The missions are good and choice of weapons excellent. Often I find it satisfying just to wander about, ride some bikes, drive cars and ride on the train shooting up whatever takes my fancy and have the cops pursue me. Talking of which, the police AI is a bit samey and could do with a fix with some variation in future GTA games.  Playing on max graphic level the visuals are fantastic with amazing attention to detail - this is what really makes it for me but then I'm a bit of a recluse and like to completely escape into a different environment for a while. The sea has realistic waves and swell, the landscapes are interesting and the city buzzes with activity.   I don't play online (tried once, too many idiots ruining it) but some folks rave about it. There seems to be an issue with using mods and being banned by Rockstar I understand, but if you're content to play the game as is you won't have a problem.   Two minor downers for me are 1/ the ludicrous helicopter flight. The machine is all over the place, rolling and swaying like it's on a rubber band; and 2/ the driving position inside many of the cars is like being a dwarf because you can barely see over the dash/steering wheel. Who's responsible for this? Have they ever driven a motor vehicle?  There are some fun cheats you can employ which enable you to get into places that attract wanted levels but I started doing this only after twice finishing the game. It has a variable ending depending on choices you make. The game is a bit pricey but compared with many others I think it's worth it for the amount of interactive fun you can have doing anything.",

Now I understand sixty bucks isn't that much hard to come by.  Is GTA5 fun? In most cases, I like to drive down a ♥♥♥♥ing mountain in my sports car and still make it without it exploding on me. I could go past a mountain to catch up to my teammates when I was away for a while. I could play golf and tennis. I could scubadive, I could find there's no easy mode to fly a plane in this game like it is in other games, which creates a sense of realism to it.  Pros: Had the highest hype train in 2015 Variable third and first person views, which most games don't have. Beautiful illustration of graphics A rather curious wellput storyline, always noting to you that in every GTA game, there's always a betrayal, which competitors don't really do, such as Saints Row GTAOnline feels realistic about a town riddled with crime and chaos, it's City Survival Simulator, technically. Although no one's trying to survive, but it gives you a frantic case of a city sprawling with gangs  But as with every game, there are cons  Cons: Money isn't easily made unless it's by stocks and doing a heist as Michael. When the player is given about 7.5K in cash, their instinct is to see what they can do with the amount of money they have compared to Franklin GTAOnline is riddled with cheaters and trainers at the moment, where even a newly made friend can be a hacker that has a mini-SMG that shoots out 40k bags of cash, just to get your attention and telling you to take it. Playerbase is unusually aggressive, but then comes a wise choice of pick your crew and group carefully, as even your own teammates can turn on you, simply for being in the same limo. Those cheaters and trainers? They get RP and cash boosts and what not. They also occasionally have the ability to drop a nuke in Los Santos and murder them while pinning someone else for the blame.  Regardless to say, though. I still personally prefer to play the game every now and then. Although what I'm spouting for the most part is blasphemy, this is still just my opinion of the game. I'm not a professional critic, after all.",

A large problem that as of now (5/31/15) there is an outrageous amount of hacks being used (traininers, cheat engine, DLL injectors, Process Memory Edits, ect.) Every other session I join has a hacker. Mostly them either blowing you up every sec, making you commit suicide, or spamming bags of money over your head. Though this can ruin the experience for most people, if you find 3 friends to do all the heists with you will be fine.

I downloaded it and got into it quite easily. The difficulty level ramps up a little after the first series of missions in single player, but one you 'get' it, you'll find it quite easy. The sandbox setting is amazing, and the little details and stuff that have gone into the singleplayer world are excellent. The Single player is too short though.   Online The online game is moderate fun. Although the map is fully visible. Unlocking weapons, cars and so forth is a lot of fun, and its not really a grind. However, there are hackers, and yes they will kill you from over the map, they can spawn in anything, from harriers to asteroids. People will troll you if you try and do objectives. However, the multiplayer element is really interesting. The bounty system is fun. However, heists are almost impossible to get into as a beginner, because people WILL kick you without explanation. I say....6/10.   EDIT:  Free-event mode. Or, a waste of an update. So, GTA got a new update, with new events occuring every 15 minutes, they can be the mundane, from pulling wheelies and flying close to the ground, to the werewolf event (Hunted) and speed. However, the interesting events don't happen often, it takes just 1 or 2 people working together to block everyone else, and its just not varied enough.  I will recommend this game to anyone who enjoys multiplayer. For a better Singleplayer experience, I would personally go to either Saints row 2 and 3, or GTA 3 and 4.",

I have had great fun on both the online platform and the single player. GTA 5 online is excellent fun with a group of buddies while completing heists or just generally arsing around. The single player is both engaging and tells an exellent and involving story. Both modes are beautiful by day and night and the port from console is un-noticable.  HEISTS - are great fun with friends and are challenging when its needed. The hollywood action movie vibe is very well recieved and makes for a great experience WHEN IT WORKS.   HOWEVER The online matchmaking systems and navigation leave A LOT to be desired. Matchmaking is slow beyond function and there is very little options at the menu when starting up the online mode. More often than not, it wil fail to join a session and throw me into single player. From here, you will find a much better menu that lets you choose the type of lobby you wish to join.  Waiting for players in heists takes atleast ten minutes MINIMUM which is outright unacceptable when there are still hundreds of thousands of people playing at any given time  sort all of this out and you have the recipe for a great game!",

Heists have been in the Game for a long time but are really fun and rewarding if you do them, Also theres alot of jobs to do with friends and the online community that can make the game so much fun.  Cons  The Online Community is maybe the only problem besides a few graphical glitches which i do not recieve but the online community is filled with hackers and smack talkers but for one thing i don't mind that really unless they get in my way and go into god mode or something which wont happen normally, also people that take the game too seriously, and theres alot of SQUEAKERS BEWARE!!  and Rockstar making the game $85 (in Australian Money) was a really bad move   Conclusion  But besides that this game is really fun and enjoying and was worth the $50 i spent on it",

Now that it works, I'm really enjoying the game, the graphics are nice, with a high res monitor they look amazing, with everything maxed I've not hit any framerate issues yet, and that's on a 4gb GTX 680.  On a first impressions basis I'd say that this is where GTA belongs, if you don't have a console version, then it's worth getting on the PC, if you do have a console version, there's some improvements over those ports but you'd have to ask yourself is having 60fps, higher res and the Movie Editor enough to make you shell out for another copy.  Control wise personally for me you can't beat the good old k/b and mouse, I've had a few adjustments to make with the driving sections as I do miss the refined movements you get with the analogue sticks on a joypad, but that's a small price to pay in order to enjoy the game on the pc. You can play using both JP and K/B &amp; Mouse, which can in some respects make the driving sections easier.  Overall it's a good game, worth getting if you don't have it and like the GTA series, I don't think you're going to find massive innovations based on the previous game, but it's a GTA game and it delivers on the parts that you want it to.",

Gym, Saloons, Tennis, clothes shops, golf, flying lessons, shooting ranges etc. etc. There's hundreds of things to do and explore outside of the main and side missions. * Inclusion of a first person mode. Didn't use it myself, but will do on a replay as it'll change the dynamics of the game.  Cons  * This is more of a gripe with all GTA games. There's no consequence if you simply escape the sirens. There needs to be an element of getting caught afterwards. I.e. someone takes a picture of you and you're a wanted person if you go on an insane rampage and get to 5*. I would recommend this is purely a hardcore thing, but still would add alot of depth to the game.  * More awareness from cops. I just jumped a red light? you're OK with that? great...

That was ♥♥♥♥ing cheap.  Now to the review.  Singleplayer mode: The storyline is quite interesting at most points. Each character has been written quite well. The heists are fun and more often than not, heart-racing (if you're like me and ♥♥♥♥ing panic in every possible video game situation involving shooting.) After you've completed the storyline, you could head down and play some golf with yourself or tennis with Michael's Wife* (maybe.) Additionally, you can complete all those strangers and freaks missions that have, which I'm pretty sure, mentally disabled people. Some of them are seriously sick ♥♥♥♥s. Like Trevor. Even before you finish the storyline, I spent 1 hour when I first had access to Franklin, just exploring the map. Performing stunt jumps etc.   GTA Online: Hackers. Hackers everywhere. As a lot a lot a LOT of people know, R* isn't doing ♥♥♥♥ about the hackers. Sure at most they've probably banned 1/10 of them. They can make the game not very fun. However, there is an option. If you have friends or a crew or whatnot, you can just head into a private session with them and play there. Because chances are you're playing like that because you don't want to go head to head with a hacker or something. Adding to that, you can also do solo-mode which is almost like Storymode, except you play on your own character and have more limited things as to what you can do.  Overall, I would say for GTA Online: 3/5 stars. Mainly because there are some glitches and stuttering as well as hackers. For GTA 5: 4/5 stars. It was pretty great, although I did encounter issues with freezes etc.  So that's 7/10. Not bad, pretty good, but also not execellent. Anyways, blah.",

Pros: - it was finally released on PC? - largeish sandbox area to explore, or is it? Somehow it feels smaller than the San Andreas title's map. - there are no locked areas; you can drive around immediately (compare to Vice City's locked bridges)  Cons: - joystick support (which worked in Vice City) is lacking, and the keyboard+mouse controls make attacking with the Little Bird gunship impossible while yawing uncontrollably. - mouse aiming of weapons is not smooth, making precision fire more difficult than it should be. - graphics don't feel modern -- there is a lot of obvious stippling or dithering on most textures.  - the much bragged about first person camera mode lacks an aim-down-sight feature.  Finally I have to say this plays more like a $30 title; $60 is a real robbery vice a PC game one. Grudgingly checking 'yes.'",

Seriously, my gripes about this game are few, and I won't even bother listing all the positive things because I'd probably leave something out.    Online mode is usually a bunch of immature players who think FPS games are for killing all other players. So I just keep to myself and don't let anyone get too close or risk getting bombed, sniped, etc.     There is also some cheating that takes place in online but Rockstar has very low tolerance for cheaters and a built in reporting system.     The jobs in online can get a little repetitive. By jobs I mean contact missions, partly because they have the best story base and partly because you'll find out who can cooperate with others to reach a common goal pretty quickly. It'll take you four hours, at level 82 because contact missions unlock over time, to play through the missions that don't require special equipment or mics for complex organization.     The wait time in lobbies can be brutal, especially when trying to get people together for a heist.     I'm still waiting for Rockstar to release a DLC with buyable mansions, because I really envy all the nice houses in 'Rockford Hills' ~ Beverly Hills.  My issues are with Online and not Story mode, which is pretty awesome.",

This can make the game seem a bit annoying, as more often than not you have no incentives (other than story) to continue playing the main storyline. There's very little money to be made until the end, and the side quests don't give you much to build on either.  Other than that, it is a great game, and well worth the money, especially if you liked previous GTAs, but I don't think I'll be replaying it anytime soon.",

In this review, I won't be referring to rockstars greed or anything of that nature, i'm reviewing the game, not the company.  Anyways, lets begin, This game is my absolute favorite game of all time. I remember being a huge fan of GTA IV and playing it daily, and I can recall the second I heard about GTA V. I was immidately hyped, there was no stopping my hype train. I was wondering how they could possibly top the greatness of GTA IV....  oh, oh they did, by a long shot!  When I launched this game for the first time, I had a feeling I can't even describe. No game will ever make me feel the way GTA V did. This game is an absolute masterpiece.   The graphics, of course, are amazing. The vehicle handling is profoundly better than that of GTA IV's. It feels like more of a racing game, more than some clunky, drifty, unbearable madness like GTA IV.  The options are endless: Want to rob a liquor store? Check Want to race your friends? Check Want to pull off a heist? Check Want to fly a giant ♥♥♥ C130 around and try and dive-bomb other players? Check Want to stand on a harrier and go up into the stratosphere and have one of your friends land a helicopter on the jet? CHECK!   I think you get the point.  If there is ANY, and I mean, ANY inclination of you getting this game, i'd say go for it, this game is worth every dime. Not only that but I don't see this game dying out anytime soon, they're always adding new, free, DLC to online mode to keep things fresh. The most recent one being a low-rider update where you can even install HYDRAULICS!   Anyways, get this game, you WILL NOT regret it.",

The campaign is a good mixture of funny and enticing, and I'm looking forward to putting more time into the single player. Despite this, it's not the best GTA ever made. I personally prefer the style of the other GTA's (San Andreas comes to mind) where you only play as one character, as I believe you feel more connected to that character as they go through a story line. It wouldn't have been the same if you could actually play as Ryder, or Wu Zi back in the day.  The online is great fun, the first few days of playing it with my friends was nothing but hilarious, however once the excitement passes and you need something 'more' to keep you playing, I feel GTA V falls behind other somewhat similar games such as Altis Life on Arma 3. First of all, as someone who preordered, I received enough money as a gift to buy the best appartment and one of the best cars. After doing a few heists, I could then afford the best car. Umm, now what? Mindless races and missions are fun for a while, but it could be so much better if there was more to spend your money on. Barely a month after the game came out and I haven't wanted to play online for a while.  Overall, I can see why many people love this game, and definately recommend you to try it.",

I do have a desktop but my laptop plays it beautifuly on Normal and High settings because I wanted that perfect frame and I thought the game would look cheap on lower settings but it wasn't. Now the game is amazing the single player is very well thought out and money means everything in the game which is a good thing because then it just wouldn't be GTA and I love how easy it is to mod single player so that means that after your done with the missions you have a lot tht you can do.

Many have complained about poor performance after updates when they had fantastic performance previously. I, myself, have only had one instance where my experience dipped into the 'poor quality' category. Other than that I've had a blast with this game. If your computer meets the minimum requirements, I'd see about buying this game. A word of advice - As soon as you're out of the tutorial, focus on finding a fast car and break some laws so you become wanted by the police. A higher the wanted level is ideal for this. That way, you'll see as soon as possible if your computer will struggle with framerate drops, popping textures or anything of the like. Police chases are considered to be one of the most prominent areas where these issues occur. If you're able to get to this point and see for yourself if you are able to play within the first few hours of having the game running, then it won't be too late to ask for a full refund if you need it.  That being said, I put over 200 hours into this game just on PC and still highly recommend Grand Theft Auto V/Online for its replayability, open-world sandbox style and engaging characters throughout the entire story.",

Also one of the best keyboard driving controls I've ever experienced. Would suggest to tweak the plane controls though when you are using a keyboard. -One of the best console ports I've ever played on PC. Rockstar did a good job optimizing this game for PC.  Cons -The story is IMO not on par with previous GTA suchs as GTA IV and GTA SA. In comparison to IV, the story is a little bit short and simple but feels like it was rushed whereas IV had a fully developed and complex storyline. The story is still good though. -Fewer side missions compared to previous GTA. While the S&amp;F missions kind of helped with the post game content, I was a bit disappointed that the side missions were mostly races and property missions. Heck, the property missions doesn't even work properly and glitches out on most of my playthroughs. -GTAO is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of grinding and game breaking mods.",

The industry needs to study under Rockstar's coders, because this game is so well optimized that it makes recent AAA releases look damn embarassing. This is without a doubt, one of the greatest games ever created.  ______ Gameplay + Almost 100% a completely succesful port. + The mouse control for Airplanes and Helicopters is surprisingly succesful once you get used to it. + The First Person view is also splendidly well integrated and fun to switch in and out of. - I still found myself wanting to play this with a gamepad, because it does have it's spikes of difficulty where auto aim toggling/target toggling + Modible cars and bikes. Although I wish the default cars for each character were able to be changed. Some aspects of the modibiltiy leave a little be desired and seem to be more cosmetic than functional. + Character stats that improve with usage. Always a + to have a little RPG element to an action game. - This causes me to drive Motorcycles at top speeds againsts 3 lanes of highway traffic to level up Driving. Like Trinity.  Graphics + Amazingly gorgeous improvement from the PS3/XBOX version. HD textures FTW. + Features like NVIDIA TXAA, PCSS, Ambient Occlusion, Depth of Field are well implemented. + Incredibly well coded and optimized to run well on high settings with an average machine. - No PhysX :(. Then again, if taking apart a house bullet by bullet, shingle by shingle and plank by plank were possible in this game like the excellent Mafia II - I would probably never be able to tear myself from it.  Story + I never really thought much of GTA's previous storys; but Rockstar knocks it out of the park. With a capability to be both silly and crass, and still have you feel a connection to each of the 3 main guys. Particularly with Michael. + Long game. Love long storys. Lots of character development over a long period of time.  + Heists!  Sound/Voice Acting + Incredible level of detail in the writing of dialogue. It is equally performed as such by the actors.  Extra Stuff + There is an essentially endless amount of extras and exploration and easter eggs to deal with if your into that. + Can't wait for the mod community to do what they do. Some more HUD/UI customizability for starters  The State of My Well Being + This game is the purest crack rock one could ever light up. - My skin is slowly fusing to my chair from video game addiction.  ?:)   ",

Along with the developed character structure and impecable voice acting, its also really fun and enjoyable. Player choice adds a great level of depth to the game and the open world is pushing the entire industry forward. Rockstar left nothing untouched in this amazing world, the level of detail is unmatched and very well done. Although it originally was a problem, Rockstar has done a great job patching the engine and allowing GTA V to run on less powerful systems while maintaining an amazing graphical standard. This is the only game I have ever bought full price, and I don't regret it. This game deserves every penny of the price. Rockstars constant updates also keep the community and the content thriving. Overall GTA V is one of my favorite games, and it reflects what I look for and anticipate in every game I review. It serves as a model for what publishers, and what the industry needs to live up to. If Grand Theft Auto V defines the future of gaming, I am excited.  10/10",

I can think of at the moment is that if you enter a mission with friends from a non-private online match, you won't always be put back together in the same match. Sometimes you will see a few friends, but others will be thrown into a different match.  Hopefully R* can fix the game issues at the moment so everyone can enjoy the game (especially those who cannot launch it).  My game also was one that wasn't working. I tried every 'fix' I could possibly find, and ended up reinstalling Windows. Doing a clean install and installing nothing but the bare minimum to get Steam, GTAV, and Teamspeak3 running - the game actually launched. I really hate that I had to reinstall my OS, and have backups of everything (system image ftw) but this is the only game I have that I couldn't get running.",

            "review_text": "EDIT: A sectioned #/10 review for different sections of the game is at the bottom, for your convenience.  ----  A great game to play with friends.  It's a truly immersive sandbox with great mods, great physics, and so much detail it routinely blows my mind. Almost every day I play it I discover some new little thing that blows my mind and makes me feel like I'm playing the game for the first time again. Saying it's perfect would be lying, but it's probably the best game in the series yet.  -----  Gameplay: Everything feels fluid in this game. The world truly feels big without being so ridiculously large that you despise the thought of travelling from one end to the other. Cars handle well. New details, both immersive and otherwise, packed absolutely everywhere. Honestly, when I think of this game I think of fantastic gameplay.  10/10   Graphics/Visual Experience: The level of attention paid to detail in this game is absurd, bordering on Kojima levels at times. A lot of these are gameplay details but I'm putting it in the visual experience section because a lot of it goes on around you without your player affecting anything. The graphics are great already, but if they're not to your liking there are tons of realism mods out there to keep you satisfied. This is another area in which Rockstar's ability to create an atmosphere really shines through.  9/10   Sound: Guns lack a bassy sound, but when the rest of the world is made so perfectly noisy, I'm willing to overlook such a misstep. Radio stations are better than ever, and Self Radio makes driving fun if you don't like the stations already in the game.  7.75/10   Replayability: This is a game that's replayable because it's versatile. I've booted up this game because I've wanted to race, because I wanted to play a biking game, because I wanted to shoot things, because I wanted to explore an open world. It does all of these and does them all equally well. For the moment this is one of the most replayable games I have in my library.  10/10   How it Runs: Quite demanding. It's not necessarily poorly optimized, it just seems that R* is so focused on maintaining a visually impressive game that they don't want to offer too many options to crank it down.",

Pros: - it was finally released on PC? - largeish sandbox area to explore, or is it? Somehow it feels smaller than the San Andreas title's map. - there are no locked areas; you can drive around immediately (compare to Vice City's locked bridges)  Cons: - joystick support (which worked in Vice City) is lacking, and the keyboard+mouse controls make attacking with the Little Bird gunship impossible while yawing uncontrollably. - mouse aiming of weapons is not smooth, making precision fire more difficult than it should be. - graphics don't feel modern -- there is a lot of obvious stippling or dithering on most textures.  - the much bragged about first person camera mode lacks an aim-down-sight feature.  Finally I have to say this plays more like a $30 title; $60 is a real robbery vice a PC game one. Grudgingly checking 'yes.'",

So while your not blowing up cars and driving like a maniac in a tank you can be doing tactical heists or going all out and attacking with all gunz blazing.

Players will like them more as the game progress. - Good endings based on player's choice.  Story Mode Cons: - Very few heists in the story mode and only available based on story progression. - You will only get rich at the end of the game, in which in kinda meaningless. - Very few attires, acessories, cars and hairstyles selection in story mode.  Story Mode Overall: One of the best game of the year. Worth to play and spend time for the story.   Online Mode Pro: - It's free!  - A lot of heists, good story progression.  - A lot of attires, acessories, cars and hairstyles  Online Mode Con: - Time consuming. You have to WAIT ♥♥♥♥♥ LONG just to enter a session, quit a session, join a heist, and the heist fail if 1 player quit, then wait to enter another session. IT'S ALL WAITING ONLY. - Many idiots - Weapons and cars unlocked based on player level, unless you willing to spend real cash.   Online Mode Overall: Would recomend you find friends of 4 and enter a private session.",

El juego si te gusta GTA y la esencia del GTA tienes que darle una oportunidad. Hay algunos aspectos en los que flojea, hay otros en los que sobrasale. La conducción en esta edición es muy buena para el teclado. Seguramente te encuentres con opiniones negativas pro los volantazos, es un teclado! no se le puede pedir mucho! Sin embargo con otro vehiculos no te vas a encontrar ningún problema. Los gráficos, por supuesto se nota el cambio con la anterior edición, no comparo con otras plataformas proque me parece absurdo.

            "review_text": "After playing the game for almost 150 hours now, I feel I have put enough time in to review it fairly, so here goes. I'll start with the good: It's the GTA that I know and love. It feels more like San Andreas than like GTA 4 to me, which is a good thing since I adored SA for its open space and variety, and felt like 4 (despite being a solid game) just doesn't live up to the legacy. GTA 5 has a well-written and interesting single-player experience: the playable characters are diverse and interact well with each other; the mission are entertaining and numerous. Probably the thing that interested me most about this iteration of GTA was the native support for multi-player (finally!) with its Online Mode. In it, players can join friends, crew (think 'clan') or strangers in session of (I believe) up to 30 players. The online version of the game is rich in Rockstar-created activities, and the mission creator allows for a great deal of additional variety. You can race, fight, arm-wrestle, play tennis, contend for resources and do a whole host of other activities with fellow criminals.  Recently, I spend most of my gaming time in GTA Online, and I feel that it really is a great addition to the game. Despite this, it has its ups &amp; downs. There are several key issues I should address here: - Hackers - Mission requirements and player dependency - Loading times So, hackers. What do I mean? One moment you're cruising around with a friend, taking on the world and feeling its the best game ever. The next you're violently exploded by a hacker from half the map away. All your weapons are suddenly gone. You open the menu to hit to hit 'change session' but you can't even do that, since THE GAME CLOSES THE MENU EVERY TIME YOU DIE. Sure, you can report them by email. Sure, hacks are transient and eventually the game should grow 'safer' and less exploitable as Rockstar addresses issues and releases patches... but right now, some days are just bad like that. What's that about mission requirements? Well, to me the best kind of missions in GTA Online are the heists. These require a 4-person team to play. So sometimes you're in the swing of things, running with a solid crew and clearing out mission-after-mission... and sometimes you're just stuck in eternal lobby-limbo, waiting for that elusive 'last member' to join your team, and every time you get one they quit mid-mission (throwing you all out, since that's how the game is designed). This might not be a problem if you're not going after heists with such enthusiasm, but eventually you have to remember one thing: Multi-player games are just that - meant for multiple people to play together, and your fellow players will make-or-break your experience with the game, almost every time. Keep that in mind, and if you have a big group of friends who are already into the game - good for you! And finally, loading times. I got a fairly high end PC and I can run the game on very high settings without performance issues, and still I spend a good 2-3 minutes loading into the game at start-up, and a minute or two after every mission. This is time consuming, it breaks the immersion, and mainly just sucks because sometimes the game initiates loading in cases where it really shouldn't have. I'll give you an example that happens to me daily: You're invited to a mission while playing online. You hit 'accept' and instantly get a message saying 'session full, returning to GTA online'... so far so good - too bad you were in-session literally 3 seconds ago, and now you're going to load up another one for 2 minutes. Done loading? What's that, another invite? 'Heh, let's try' you say... Nope. Full again. Loading again. Enjoy your wait. This issue might not be that bad if you're running the game off an SSD, but then again, it's a 60 GB game. Kinda heavy, IMO.  TL;DR? I got you covered. Good: Great looking game. Very solid single-player. Online mode is a beast, especially when you have friends online. Bad: Some bugs ruin missions, though rarely. Hackers online. Game aka 'Loading Simulator 2015.' Final verdict: Very Recommended!  Thanks for taking the time to read my review. Obviously all the above is just my opinion, and I appreciate anyone who cares enough to read it. So far, I enjoyed the game very much and I'd say buy it and have a blast :)",

This has been stated multiple times, and has been stated that you will NOT BE BANNED FOR USING MODS IN SINGLEPLAYER!  Clear? Clear. On with the review!  I won't be going over the main game, because you already know how good it is. Grand Theft Auto V, the fast-paced crime simulator made by the incredible Rockstar Games finally comes to PC in what is considered the definitive edition of the game, and for good reason. 60FPS and 4k support changes the game so much, along with mouse &amp; keyboard support. Aiming is much easier. The new Rockstar Editor feature allows you to record, edit, and upload clips of your random adventures in Los Santos. Directly related is Director Mode, which allows you to set conditions and change the environment of the world, and make amazing videos filled with action, and set music of your choice. Mods make the PC version the best part of the game without question: Bored? Spawn a Hydra and go flying around the map, as a monkey, and make it rain whales and enable carmageddon and have cars explode and fly around like an eagle on bath salts. As said before, be warned- Remove any and ALL modifications to the base games before going into Grand Theft Auto Online, because you WILL be banned for cheating online. Again, ANY and EVERY SINGLE MOD. Even FOV will get you banned. Although this is hated by many, it is to prevent cheaters.  EDIT #2: Apparently people are throwing a fit because they wanted GTA V to go on sale and it didn't. What happened INSTEAD was Rockstar was nice and offered to give you a shark card, san andreas/max payne 3, AND gta v, all for 60 dollars. PRETTY GOOD ♥♥♥♥ING DEAL. The sad part is most people aren't complaining about GTA V itself not being on sale, no- THEY'RE ♥♥♥♥♥ING ABOUT BEING 'FORCED' TO BUY AN EXTRA GAME, GTA V, AND IN GAME MONEY, FOR THE SAME PRICE. People, get your ♥♥♥♥ together.",

Having played the story once, but not finishing on xbox 360 brings a familiar feeling of course while playing this version, and there are missions in this that i didn't really want to play through again, but the addition of the first person view adds a whole new dimension to things. Being face to face with the game world immerses the player wonderfully and what an awesomely vivid place it is. Textures pop, books on bookshelves have readable spines, signs in shops aren't simply blobs of colour..everything is there to be read and in first person mode, it's in your face. It's certainly not an afterthought mode either, the game works fluidly in this mode and everything just works as if it was meant to be played that way. It's no user mod.  The settings pages scream 'PC VERSION' with everything you could possibly want adjustable, there to be adjusted. The overhaul to the lighting and effects has brought gaming a contender for the most beautiful game of the decade. It's just ♥♥♥♥ing nuts. It's a sandbox I don't want to leave any time soon. 10/10",

The game has been casualized for the mainstream consumer, but i still enjoy it and the missions offer alot of variety. The story is not that good, its good enough but the story in gta 4 for example was way better. Im not too fond of the mutiple endings, it should've just been 1 ending.  The Multi-player is a mixed bag, it can be really fun with friends but the missions don't offer alot of variety, the main thing it has going for it is the heists but once your done with those then its hard to still find stuff to do. The dificulty lever is higher in online than in single-player but this also means that every party member needs to have their ♥♥♥♥ together, which is ok with friends but it can be really annoying with random people. Alot of the cool stuff that you can buy is hidden behind massive in-game money ammounts, this is of course implemented so that people will buy the sharkcards (microtransactions for in-game money). So its either grinding the heist mission untill you gathered alot of money or paying up, this is what annoys me the most about the online experience. There is also a big problem with cheaters but if you plan to only play with friends this shouldn't be a big deal.  Overall i reccomend you to buy it, but not to expect much from the multi-player if you don't have friends to play with.",

I'm running an i7-4770k and a EVGA 4GB Superclocked GTX 770 and I'm running at a consistent 60fps at 1080p on a mix of high to very high settings. I have not tried them, but from what I understand, 4K, 3D, and triple monitor support are also in, and unofficial fan-made VR drivers are looking like they're coming along well. The game also natively supports the Dualshock 4 without any need for an XInput wrapper. Here are some tips for performance:  - Install the latest graphics card drivers. This should really be obvious but I see so many people complain about the game's performance without having done this. They help so much. I remember friends reporting weird stuttering and black lines on characters before installing the drivers, and now everything is butter smooth. - Leave grass on High, not Very High. Lighting is affected by grass, so adding more of it stacks performance issues exponentially. - Turn off MSAA and rely on FXAA for your anti-aliasing. 4x MSAA is similar to essentially playing the game in 4K. No bueno, unless you have a Titan X or something.  You're probably also wondering about GTA Online. Yes, it was ♥♥♥♥ when it first came out. It's not now. Honest. Heists are the kind of mission that GTA Online should have had since the beginning, and require honest-to-God coordination and teamwork to get done on a reliable basis, as well as massively alleviating the grind. Unfortunately, there's only five, but running the regular missions and races/deathmatches/etc. inbetween help alleviate the repetitiveness. The regular missions, unfortunately, are mainly GTAIV quality of 'go here, kill these guys, take this thing back here,' but the heists are VERY well put together and the roles of the four players are utilized very well. The added quality-of-life updates also make just about everything about GTAO's general gameplay, well... not a pain in the ♥♥♥, like it was at launch.  I've had no issues connecting to GTAO, even on day one, and I still have connectivity issues on the PS4 version sometimes. Driving cars with the keyboard is better than I thought it would be, but still not as good as using a controller, but helicopters and planes are damn near unbearable on M+KB. I'd definitely consider switching to a controller on the fly when you enter those - the game supports it. I've also had no issues with Rockstar Social Club, and the entire thing is fairly seamless, inobtrusive, and has some neat stat-tracking stuff. Still would have preferred Steamworks for GTAO connectivity, but... whatever.  The PC additions are pretty great on their own, too. The video editor is well-implemented and has a ton of options, and Director Mode doubles not only as a way for staging your own GTAV video fanfiction, but also as a general ♥♥♥♥around tool that lets you play as Flying Lamar With Explosive Punches. You can also use your GTAO character in single player with it, for maximum self-insertion.  Is it worth $60 if you haven't played GTAV yet somehow? Oh Jesus, yes. Is it worth it if you have? If you really love GTA like I do, yes. If not that much, waiting for even a 25% or 33% off sale would probably work best. It's a great port for a great game, and it and Max Payne 3 show how Rockstar is really turning it around in the PC department.",

In comparison to any other GTA game, you have more than one playable character (as you should already know), which is a real nice idea; You have an explorable map! You unlock every part of the map by being in the place, this is something which surprised me, and I REALLY liked it, because it makes a lot more sense than having everything from the beginning. and the game becomes some sort of exploration. I liked as usual that it's Open World and stuff, you are free to do whatever you want. I really liked the car customization here, and it's better than GTA: San Andreas, which are from what I know are the only games where you can actually customize your cars and not just respray and all that stuff. The NPCs here are smart finally, they actually try to dodge your car when rushing towards their car, but sometimes they by 'dodging' actually hit my car sometimes, I mean they're dodging in the wrong direction, but it isn't that bad. The Heists! of course, it is a real cool thing they added here, you can rob shops, and prepare for heists. I still didn't touch the Online game, so I won't say anything about how it works there.  I also really liked the way you have to avoid cops. It is a lot more realistic, but if you drive into a 'Los Santos Customs' and wait there for a while the cops won't look for you, or wait for you to come out. It is something which should be fixed (here I'm not sure, maybe I got it wrong). The overall gameplay is pretty hard, for me it took to somewhere 25% completion to really understand how the game works, and the 25% took me around 8 hours of gameplay, which is a long time for an average gamer like me. There is one thing which just has to be added to the game: Remote Detonator for Sticky Bombs! (Here I'm also not sure if there isn't but I was searching the web and the keyboard assignments and didn't find anything useful) Overall I'll give this game an 8.5/10, mostly for the hard-time I got understanding how the game works.",

The graphics look great but I guess that is individual to your rig. I really thought first person mode was going to be more than it is. Your view is restricted in first person, also, walking in first person is much different than in third person. it's more like a rushed tap dance. That being said, it's a refreshing addition and many of the visuals have been tweaked to allow it. ie: getting hit by a car, beating someone up.",

The car customization is vast, the car selection is huge, and add that you can drive everything in first person with every car having its own unique look to its interior.   The story mode is addicting, 9/10 will have you on the edge of your seat doing whatever they have you doing, and the fact you have 3 main characters you can switch inbetween as you unlock them, and missions for them.  i suggest this game to any GTA fan as well as anyone looking for an all around open world game with a mix of fps,driving,interactive story,customizations,graphics,and online features.",

I have small things I'm personally not a fan of are the EXTREMELY high prices of some things in game, due to them using microtransactions to sell in game cash online, &amp; there being characters you're forced to switch through in SP. The first is there for them to make money to keep the servers online, so although it's annoying &amp; makes the game a bit grindy, it's understandable. The second is just my personal taste in RPG games.",

The unpacking was insane, no idea i would need basically 120gigs to pull it off total so I had to throw a lot of games on an external. After that getting all set up I wasnt able to start the game at all. I would launch and nothing would start! It was frustrating but found a way around it by disabling my main graphics card on my laptop. BUT steam just put up the patch that fixed all my problems and now im rolling smooth! Now we can get to the game, its awesome and massively open! love the huge alive world! So far I am just doing the story so Im loving the character developement. One of my favorite parts is after a long day of gangstering and street racing I can kick back in my home and light up a little while watching some hilarious cartoons. Its worth the wait and cant wait to go online.",

The game is good, there is no doubting that. I enjoy the singleplayer, I love the multiplayer. The problem everyone has is with Rockstar's adamant stance of 'No Mods'. Which can be reasonable when you realize these mods also affect GTA Online. Chainguns that shoot money, Legit hackers who are invincible, stat hacking to level 3030. The problem is real and so is the solution Rockstar has put forward.  The game will now check to see if you are editing it in anyway and then you get flagged, this counts for using the mods only in singleplayer. So if you don't care about modding, you are fine. If you want to mod the game, I would suggest waiting to see how this next brawl between the PC Gaming community and a multi-million dollar video game company goes.",

            "review_text": "For 567 days the only things I knew about GTA5 were from Rockstars trailers. I purposely deprived myself of all gameplay videos. I avoided reviews. I abandoned friends who were playing it. If I was a catholic priest out on parole for sexual abuse, GTA5 was a scantily clad altar boy.  As far as I was concerned, it didn't exist until it existed on PC. Unlike many I have faith in Rockstar and since it's probably safe to assume their developement team doesn't consist entirely of an army of Helen Keller clones they've heard PC gamers whining about 'ports' for years.  So, what was the result of my GTA5 sensory deprivation? Well, I spent the first hour with the game walking around in first person with my mouth agape until my tongue began to feel and look like a pink raisin. At first with completely maxed settings at 2720x1530, but my rig was showing it's age a bit (Watercooled 4.05GHz Xeon X3360, 8GB DDR2, 2GB 7870XT Tahiti LE @ 1.2/1.6GHz) so I set tessellation on normal and knocked shadows down as well as took one knotch off view distance and was satisfied with a consistent 45-50FPS and by far the most beautiful and detailed game I've ever seen, as well as one of the most well optimized.  But then, a sort of disappointment crept in as I was driving around with a 360 controller. Why am I driving with a gamepad when I have a Logitech G27 right in front of me? As a spoiled PC gamer, even with this digital masterpiece I found myself wanting a little more. My attempt at solution was X360CE, and the next 2 hours were spent trying to get it to work. After nearly giving up I realized that GTA5 is a 64-bit game which needed the X360CE 64-bit libraries. BINGO I'M KIND OF A GENIUS!  Once X360CE 64-bit was installed, I heard the cheerful ding of the xinput hook when I booted GTA5 back up and BEGAN DRIVING AROUND LOS SANTOS WITH MY G27!!! As a bonus, I actually got the vibration working in X360CE for the first time ever, so not only am I driving with my wheel in GTA5, I am also feeling bumps in the road. Pair this with a pair of Beyerdynamic DT-770 noise cancelling headphones and I am completely immersed in Los Santos with little concern for the real world.  Rockstar, you have outdone yourselves and I love you. If anyone ever questioned whether or not video games are a true art form GTA5 proves that it is. In fact, I'd go beyond that and say if you offered me the next 5 years with my only posession being the actual Mona Lisa or GTA5 I would not only choose GTA5, but would help you cram that terribly stupid juxtaposition deep into your nether regions so I could be left to my current objective of growing a full neckbeard and avoiding the outdoors.  TL;DR: BUY THIS. NOW. Stop debating it and buy it. Have a steering wheel? Download X360CE 64-bit so you can lose yourself driving around the most beautiful and immersive city ever realized in a game.",

The Heists are probably the best part of this game (multiplayer) and if you can find 3 other people that can play with you then it's very fun.

The game has a gameplay that has never been seen in any GTA and it truly packs a punch to anyother OPEN world game. No one does it better than Rockstar Games. Graphically the game is beautiful, playing it on my PC was truly an experience I wont forget. The richness in ambient colors and the perfection of making a game that introduces similarities to real life. Multiplayer in this game is wonderful and after spending more than 40 hours on Multiplayer, I can say that it surpasses any other Rockstar Games multiplayer experience.   GTA V delivers a story line that includes seriousness and humor at the same time and it was definitely played out smoothly. The three main protagonist were wonderful, and had a unique aspect that only Rockstar can create. However, IT IS NOT the best Rockstar Games story. I felt that GTA V's story was the ONLY reason as to why I cannot give GTA V a perfect score. It felt to humorous and unemotional. It was quiet simple, and dull at some moments. This could have been because of the new 3 character system; feeling less emotion to one character because there are others to choose from. Being a long term GTA fan I feel the best story has been GTA IV because of that dark and grim personality of Niko and his struggles to live an American dream, such as myself. GTA V was also to short, it just felt to plain. No connection to the characters was my main concern, they felt so short lasting. Rockstar Games truly lost opinion on its stroy line structure with GTA V, which months ago I felt it will live up to other Rockstar Games, but I guess I was wrong.   Rockstar Games is the best video game company out there, and no matter what title they bring out, it will always impress. The way they introduce reality at our finger tips and emotions towards characters is a brilliant way to nominate its games into categories such as BEST GAME OF THE YEAR and introduce them into BEST GAMES OF ALL TIME.",

Negative (VERY hard to find much)  -Driving in 1st person is a little crazy, maybe if they add oculus rift support this will be a possitive ;)  -obveous few glictches and bugs but its all minor stuff that will probably get fixed asap    SO as you can tell there is basiclly nothing negative over this massive overhaul of the game. And yes it was worth every penny of that $60.... so yea you can say i paid '$120' for this game but it is what it is. and with how amazing this is it feels like a whole new game.   ",

I enjoyed the game back when it released on last gen consoles but as a PC gamer myself I found the experience was hindered by low framerate, low resolution, and screen tearing even on the most recent Xbox 360 model, not to mention a online fee for a console I rarely dust off. All the qualities missing from that experience I now have on PC: 1080p60 running on my personal rig, configurable settings to hit that perfect quality/performance ratio, and  FREE ONLINE MULTIPLAYER .   The only negative comments I can make about this game regard the tedious and inconsistent menus. Some GTA Online menu items are missing in the online menu when compared to the single player menu, and there are seemingly three avenues to accept and manage friends and game invitations. Loading screens are long partially because it is too large to justify installing on my SSD but it is made worse by the fact that one must load into a random online session just to join a friend's session and load again. Thankfully these issues are easilly forgotten while reinacting 9/11 with fighter jets.",

How wrong I was. The amount of work that have been put in this release is phenomenal. The optimization seems top notch, and even the Next gen console version looks bad versus the 4k beefed version. I'm not playing in 4k, few people can, but I have enough horsepower on my rig to play it on ultra 1080p and I have to say that it's amazing.   Mouse &amp; keyboard controls are good (mostly for shooting!) but are a little clumsy in vehicle phases. Good thing I have an old x360 pad at hand.  Technically speaking, I dont know what to say. I'm speechless. There's so much graphical option than even the best PC games pales compared to this. For once, we have a true PC version, and not a quick cheap port with few to none options for us PC Master Race Overlords who loves tweaking everything =D   I have only played 2 hours, but I can already say that I don't regret one bit to have paid full price for this game.   And considering how much copies have sold already, I hope more editors will be willing to make true PC version of their games in the future, seeing the huge potential it represent.",

I wish I had a 1440p or 4k to run it to see really how great it can be, but im am very pleased with 1080p.   I did notice one issue. When i run msaa there is a pixelization error at the bottom right corner of the screen. A small square . Running 2x Msi 3g gaming r9 280 in crossfire. Also AMD released a new crossfire profile for GTA V but it doesnt seem to be utilizing both gpus to there max. Im only getting about 55% on both.  Still hugely impressed Rockstar!!

When I was around 8 my friend's brother let me play this game, It was Grand Theft auto 3 I use to go round there house and always play it. Thought it was amazing and then he moved house and i never remembered the name of the game. Until Years later I was searching the Xbox 360 store and then I found Grand theft auto 5, I watched youtube videos about it and it was exactly like that game I had played at my friends house but better. So I brought it, Best game I had played in years. And online being able to play with friends was even better. Years on and the Xbox One came with first person on gta 5 came I thought I must have it so as you can proberly guess i brought the Xbox One and then Gta 5. Then a while later Gta 5 For PC Came out I did not get it staight away around 13 months later then as you can proberly guess i brought a Gaming PC With GTX 960 Graphics card, Intel i5 and Gta 5. And to this day I still think this game is the best game out there. I know my steam says 50 hours but thats just on PC In total I've played Months on this game.",

When i got it however, dont get me wrong i was hesitating a voice wrang through my head saying 'What am i doing? spending $60 on a video game?! thats INSANITY!!' but once i watched the trailers a few more times, absorbing the complexity and graphics until i finally thought 'This is F*****G worth it!' when i bought it i was worried that it wouldnt work on my trashcan (aka laptop which i love btw tottaly not personal stuff) but after the anticipation of the oh i think 5 HOUR WAIT i was suprised, to find out it crashed ALOT, i could run it with my graphics and everything, until one MAGIC reboot set it all up, i was getting the best FPS i have ever gotton in a high graphical demanding game, and i was suprised! except there is one thing you should look out for, while there is no physical 'DLC' to but from steam, i recommend buying on eof the shark cards (preferrably one that can buy you a house and a car) or else your going to be working your A** off, if you want to do hiests, you have to have a high level which doesnt come with the game SUPRISE SUPRISE!! in order to grind your ♥♥♥ off, you need to grind your ♥♥♥ off, to grind your ♥♥♥ off, so do yourself a favor and buy a 1.250 mill dollar Shark Card (unless you fancy working alot) in general, i give this game a complete 10/10 IGN would rob again...? im not sure, but in conclusion BUY THE F**** OUT OF IT.",

I have small things I'm personally not a fan of are the EXTREMELY high prices of some things in game, due to them using microtransactions to sell in game cash online, &amp; there being characters you're forced to switch through in SP.

I highly recommend this for everyone, even if violence isn't your thing. So many mini games, great soundtrack, fun physics, hilarious banter to be overhead while driving and walking past pedestrians. My sister doesn't like video games really but she loves to just drive around the map and sometimes when I get off work I love to do the same.   This game is probably the closest thing to a life sim that is out right now. Especially when you switch to 1st person.   I don't want to write a whole essay here but maybe the biggest selling point of this game for me is that Rockstar is STILL releasing DLC for this game and it's always 100% free. It's a little ridiculous how much they want us to like them but it has worked and I will certainly be in line for the next pc GTA title.",

I haven't played another game that would allow me to steal a car make it my own in very sense, live the high life and all that it encompasses Hire hookers and strippers, get drunk till you pass out and die. Rob Banks, Commit unspeak acts against your fellow man. So whats not to like?    Here is where it gets really wierd for me. The game is based on letting the player commit any act of unspeakable depravity he or she would like, but if you shoot or interfere with other players to much you are PUNISHED LOL. If you kill to many civilians your mental state rises? The game in that way sends the strangest signal.   Then we come to my favorite part. I have been a computer gamer since the 80s. I don't remember a game in recent memory, including both Dayz and Dayz Standalone, that had this many glitches, and I mean serious jacked up no messing around glitches. If you make friends with another player as I have your game could crash untold number of times trying to join there game. Hacking and Modding is on an epic scale. Its the strangest thing in the world to sell a game for 60 dollars plus and to have issues on this level. So here I sit with this game it's like the girlfriend that you always liked but annoyed the heck out of you in the end you couldn't decide whether to break up or marry.    My message to all would be buyers. GTA5 is like the SEA you love her but don't turn your back on her because she has a kitchen knife.",

I wish it had more heists, which is a high-level mission in several parts. However, heists do require a group of 4 friends, as playing with random strangers can suck. Online however has an issue with loading screens, which are frequent and looooong. I play on a brand new gaming PC on a 250/250 mbit fiber connection, but it still takes several minutes for load screens that crop op a lot more than you would tihnk is necessary.

Would I recommend Grand Theft Auto Online: No - here's why:  I logged on earlier today only to find I have been permanently banned (ironically I was looking at the recent reviews moments beforehand and wondering what they were talking about). Now I myself have fallen victim to a ridiculous fault in the game itself.  Did I break the rules? No Was I given a reason/date/any information? No Could I appeal? No  When I tried to appeal, not once but twice, I received an automated response (under new regulations) that I could not appeal from a ban.  Advice: If you planning on buying this game for singeplayer, go ahead. If you were planning to delve into GTA online...don't. If you do, all I can advise is: to play in friendly lobbies, don't record your gameplay, make sure your internet is 100% stable, never play missions with random people or do anything publically.  As you can see this is very limiting, but any one of these reasons could have gotten me banned. Rockstar has the worst anti-cheat system I have ever seen and I did not expect to buy the game and be unable to play it after spending around 500 hours on it (which makes it all the more bitter). It is honestly such a shame that they had to ruin a fun game, fortunately there are other games that will not disappoint you as much as this one.",

Which was the only way to buy it, unless you wanted GTA San Andreas or Max Payne. So if someone posts in the comments about me being wrong about it being $80 then they should go do some Googling about what happened.

People no longer want to play Online aside from obvious script kiddies which there are majority of Online population now.. Legit players moved to Single Player and started playing with mods which is a lot more fun and has a lot more depth without pointless grinding or dealing with cheating scumbags..   And rockstars didnt like that.. because more and more people stopped playing Online and moved to Single Player They stopped releasing content for single player.  But that wasnt enough for them they actualy had the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to release a script that blocks off ability to use online content in story mode (lowrider dlc cars spawned in Story Mode instantly got despawned) fortunately modders came up with the fix but this is just the begining im afraid r* will most likely continue to ruin life for modders company that once said that they support single player modding ... now are realeasing scripts to prevent from modding the game yeah...  developers of this game went ♥♥♥♥ing nuts over money they went same path Overkill and EA went and they will now most likely continue to block off single player modding because no one wants to play their ♥♥♥♥ing bugged , riddled with cheaters dying online mode.  Its all about shark cards BUY SHARK CARDS *middle finger* to the community  Do not buy there is no point in buying this trainwreck of a game anymore if they continue towards this path of undermining modders and story mode players  There is absolutely no point in getting the pc version  tho after this 'stunt' i wouldnt buy any rockstar games at all this was the last time i bought something from these EA wannabes  You have been warned  ---------------------------------------- Game is really fun to play but getting it to run properly is a gamble  1 wrong component or faulty software and you wont be able to play GTA 5 no matter what.

Read below, here is how i rate this game:  Story mode 8/10  Online 1/10 : Hackers everywhere , every session has a hacker in it and they can do to you whatever they want kill you , crash your game , remove your vehicles/money , remove passive mode or even frame you for hacking (turn your character into a walking bomb that will kill everyone as if you killed them)  And Rockstar doesnt seem to handle the situation properly.. occasionaly they ban few of them for 2 weeks only. :/",

November 8th: Me and a few friends decided to try the new Deadline game mode after messing around in a private free mode lobby for a while. We do this, and when were done, I got sent in to a public game for about a minute before I quit the game. Approximately two hours later, I get an email saying my account broke the EULA and terms of service, and I have been suspended for 30 days and my stats reset. Why? I have never once cheated/hacked/modified my game files. If I had to guess, there was probably a hacker in the public game I was in, and I was in just long enough to get dragged along with him. All the horror stories about getting suspended are true, I found out. I tried contacting support and got a copy/paste response about how the ban system works. My friend also contacted them and got a name for me to ask for, even going to the length of calling their support hotline and speaking to a (rather cocky) employee who told him that I would have to call (the entire call was also recorded). It was late at night at the time I heard about it so instead of calling, I sent in another ticket explaining in detail what happened, and mentioned his ticket number and the persons name...same response. Thanks Rockstar for taking over 600 hours of gameplay away from me for no real reason. I loved GTA Online, but after this, I am never buying any of your products again.

For what I've seen, a lot of new people (including my friend) are getting banned without a reason from GTA 5 online. The ban period is for one month. Since there was nothing he did wrong, there is a big chance that when he logs in after that month, he will be perma banned. When you address this issue to R*, all they do is give you the same reply over and over again and redirect you to their license and agreement. I would NOT recommend to buy this game, since you can get banned without a reason. R*'s ego about their automated ban system is so huge, starting a discussion with them about it is just a waste of your own time.  For all the people that are sitting, ready to reply: 'your friend is a cheater, he got what was coming to him', just forget it. I would not waste my time writing this review if I knew he hacked/cheated or whatever.  Please note that this review is regarding the support R* doensn't offer and GTA 5 online.

Update 2-12-16: one month later, just as predicted my friend was banned again (permaban). He even asked R* to check his files before he logged in with a clean install. They refused and said to contact them again when he would be banned. We all know where this is going. Will update when something comes out of it, if not...we gave up on this game.",

            "review_text": "The single player game is rather good, but the online game is just unplayable.  1. Countless bugs. When you do a heist there is about a 50% chance that you cannot finish it because of a bug. I am not even kidding. That means if you spend 2 hours on a heist, you are only actually playing the real game for 1 hour, as most of these bugs require a restart of the game.  2. Crashes. Random crashes occur all the time. Not only that, but some crashes are so terrible that it requires you to reinstall the game. One friend of mine has reinstalled the game more than 10 times now, I am yet again not kidding. More than 10 times he needed to download the entire game again, which is about 60gb each time.  3. Glitches. The only thing in the online game that is important is money. You can buy money from the store of the game, but that is never needed. There are multiple glitches and hacks which can make you a millionaire from doing nothing. That is destroying the gameplay a lot, and the programming level of this game to make these hacks possible is just terribly low (I am a programmer myself, and I am shocked that Rockstar Games managed to do this).  4. Online in a random game is just terrible gameplay. If you are in a car (which you most likely are), people will just one hit you with an RPG or a Homing Launcher. These players then have to pay a fine for your car if it was insured, which it most likely is. That means that they have to pay for the missile shot ($1500) and then the car (~$6000), but they do not care and think that they have 'won' the battle, even if they payed for it. This either means that people are just not smart enough in this game to understand that what they do actually makes them lose a lot of money, or that those players are using the glitches to have unlimited money, and can therefore just waste money to win in PvP. That means that money is much greater than skill in this game.  5. Heists. Apart from all the bugs, finding people to go to a heist with is just horrible. Most people can't even speak or type in english. This makes it impossible to finish a heist with random people. You have to use external websites to find a heist team, and even then its hard to find people that can actually finish a heist (about 5% chance to win a heist each try, hours and hours doing the same thing over and over). Even if you finish all heists in a row, or without dying at all, there are bugs that removes the additional money given for achievements. This means that you can spend around 10 hours doing an achievement, and then when you should get $10 000 000 for it, you just get nothing.  I always wanted to work at Rockstar Games, but now I feel that I have nothing to learn from them. How can they fail so miserably making a game that works with that much money?",

            "review_text": "Hi.  This is about my first serious review, and I'll try to advise you if it's worth it or not to buy the game, based on my personal opinion. As you probably know, GTA has two kind of game modes, Online and Story mode and I'll judge both.  PLEASE REMEMBER, this is my personal opinion and everything is based on what I feel about the game, and I'll undersand and respect yours aswell.  - Story Mode -  Catchy story-mode. Somewhat fun and dynamic questline. Some nostalgic feels. Balanced prices and easy fun. Huge map, but feels somewhat empty.  My opinion -    It's pretty standard, same grab this kill that, race this kind of missions, but is it good?   From my point of view, it can be fun, though it lacks the ' Gta San Andreas ' vibes, but hey, it's a new game.  If you came for the ol'gangbanging drive-by feel, it will let you down, mostly it's big game moves, stealing banks and others.  But, apart from that, and that you can't get all the 'online' perks and dlc stuff, it's a pretty fun single player.   - Online - Huge open world, tho some of it lacks content. Huge grind to get money. Almost everything overpriced. ♥♥♥♥♥♥ community ( Imagine COD's and Minecraft community togheter, yeah ). Free DLC's but really expensive in-game content. Hackers and modded accounts. Bad servers with huge loading times and frequent lost connections. Weak UI, somewhat challenging to get around. Game-modes feel straight up pushed into the game ' just to add content '. Races are fun! ...kinda.  ||| - I understand that my views towards the online mode are mostly money centered, but without cash, you can't get around really. You need money for bullets, money for cars, money for houses, money for almost everything, it's the Lifeblood of the game. - |||    So in my opinion :   The online feels like a massive grind. You'll get around but it just feels like you'll never enjoy the game to it's fullest without money.   The community is just random, either they wont ever bother to talk to you or straight up blow up everything you love and care about. It really feels like a pay to win game.  Did I mention the hackers and modded accounts that will make you feel poor? New DLC out! Great! What new content will I try? Oh, I can't really afford any.  Alright, I got really side-tracked there, sorry. I used to love GTA, but it feels that they've went way to greedy on everything and basic things that could be done to fix the game or improve it are shunned upon by the creators and instead we are given ever more expensive content to either buy shark cards or grind for 4 hours straight to get ONE CAR. It's just not the kind of game I wouldn't buy, and yes, I regret buying it. -----------------------------   Thank you for stopping by, I hope this helped you in anyway, take your time to read other reviews and don't stick with just one, remember this is my opinion and yours might differ from mine.

It was quite clear that  console users rack up more money and that is exactely why Rockstar decided to wait 1,5 years for the PC release.   This company doesn't care about the players anymore.  For example: GTA Online is becoming a disaster. The modders totally ruin the game. You can find a hacker in every single session you join. Before, it was a bit better. Now, due to the absence of any anti-cheat, the modders just roam the map and decide to ruin everyone's game experience. Rockstar doesn't seem to care at all. Don't get me started on the loading times. Joining or hosting a mission/heist may take up to 10 minutes. Leaving the game takes time, getting into the game takes even more time. Sometimes the game just fails to connect to Online and puts you automatically into single player, which is ridiculous and takes more time. They should've really made something like SA-MP was - offer independent servers to be rented out, so that people can choose, which gamemode to play.  Well, You may check my game hours and say that I am full of crap. I bought this game for Online. I tolerated the loading times and the little-to-none hackers in the beginning of the PC release. Now, I have understood that Online is over-hyped and quite boring, plus, with hackers, it is impossible to enjoy freemode, as I constantly have to put on Passive Mode, to prevent getting killed instantly by an atomic bomb or whatever hacks these guys have.  If you really like GTA francise, buy the game after the Summer Sale, as Rockstar decided to grab even more money, before they leave this game. If you don't want to cope with the problems this game currently has, wait for a bit. Maybe in 3 months, they have put a anti-cheat system into Online and fixed the loading times. Maybe.",

I would have assumed that they might have learned how bad GTAIV was when released due to performance issues, and being a crappy port. Nope, they didn't learn a thing! Delays after delays and they released another shoddy port.   What sort imbecile creates an FOV with such restrictive options?! I loved the idea of the First Person perspective, but after throwing up TWICE, I gave up using it. The last time I had an issue with FOV was with Half-Life 2 when they changed FOV between FPS and vehicle use to simulate speed.   I also assumed, due to the extreme time it took to get this out to PC that they would at least figure out that some peripherals, like a Rudder or a Joystick can't be used for typing. But if you do own any of them, especially a rudder pedal, when you type your login details in the horrid idea of a social club, it won't allow you to. It will pop-up a virtual keyboard, requiring you to use the rudder so it allows you to type on the keyboard.   Not only that, some textures look washed out, or blurry. Where are the High Definition textures you get in games like Shadows of Mordor?   For a classic to be sullied by bad policies like this, is truly saddening. This is, quite likely, the last time I buy any Rockstar game, until they figure their ♥♥♥♥ out.   ",

I admit, this game has a lot of cool and fun stuffs in the single-player ... and with mods, the single-player can continue and replayed for a fair amount of time. However, GTA Online ... the online part of GTA V, it is just a let-off. GTA Online is either 'Grief' TA Online or 'Grind' TA Online.  GTA Online hardly can be said fun at all. I can be in a lobby filled with players but, not a single one bothered to join my mission ... they are busy shooting each other in freemode. Then joined a few crews in hope for a better chance, oddly ... the crew-members never accept the invitations. Of course, one would then troll 'git gud and git some friends' ... let's just say, 'perhaps bad timing'.  In the end, I am still solo in the freemode ... cannot find anyone to join 'my mission' when I see lots of 'anyone' running in front of me shooting each other ... -facepalm. Then one can also troll 'go join other player's mission' ... yeah I do but, how'bout a change for a little? Doing the same heists over-n-over with different players on different days ... just the same dayyum heists, I am getting bored and annoyed.  The only side-activities offered in GTA Online are ... ... watching players killing each other in freemode. ... waste the money on 'digital' strippers and hookers. ... wait for Simeon ordering a dayyum vehicle and try get it. ... wait for a target vehicle to spawn and try destroy it.

First, they try to force people onto their own DRM platform by restricting retail copies from being activated on Steam; all to save the standard 30% cut to Valve.  But that's nothing compared to intentionally misleading customers by jacking the price and applying a 25% 'discount', which brings the price a massive £1 lower than the previous asking price. It's nothing more than a deliberate attempt to mislead people into thinking they're getting a discount, when they are not.  Unfortunately, most consumper protection law does not apply to Steam thanks to that handy 'subscriber agreement'.

So i open up my game and start online. Unfortunatly I got banned withing about 30 minutes of playing. Reason: Issue Type Cheat/Exploit Report or Banning Issue Are you able to play the game? — Activation Code — Please Enter your Mobile Device Model: — Cheat/Ban Issue Type Appealing a Ban  I read this then go to the reply and say: Dear Gta 5,  I would like a well done explanation of why I was banned. From what i can recall I started as normal on the streets, stole a car and then drove recklessly down the highway for a long while. Switched between cars a little. Then decided to rob 2 convenience stores. I then proceeded to swim to remove stars. I then went on a hiking trail mugging civilians as I went. On normal Gta 5 I have one mod properly installed. as far as I know that mod doesn't work online. I do know for a fact that I was NOT using said mod online even if I could.  I have no idea why I would have gotten banned. Perhaps there has been a mix up or something. please revoke my ban.  Thank you, Mr.Brightside42  And the response I get is:  Hello Mr.Brightside42,  Thank you for contacting Rockstar Support. GTA Online bans are triggered by a number of factors, including modding in GTA Online, exploiting or abusing game mechanics, manipulating protected game data and code, or otherwise interfering with other players’ gameplay experience. If you are banned from GTA Online, your ban expiration date is show in the lower-left corner after being returned to Story Mode following an attempt to play online.  We generally do not overturn temporary bans nor can we guarantee individual responses to any temporary or permanent ban appeals; however, we will review any evidence you submitted and take it into consideration. No further information is required from you at this time, and this ticket will close on its own.  Best regards, Rockstar Support  And all i have to say to this is that, well, this system is corrupt if I can get banned for doing litterally nothing. I am extremly mad at the help desk for this abomination of a response. I love the game for story mode, and was really looking forward to the online mode with my brother but the game thought otherwise. I believe that the reasoning behind my ban was that someone else going by the name Mr. Brightside was in fact modding and due to a mix-up I got banned. As unfortunate as this was for me, my ban is only temporary and ends september, 2 2016.  I would say that you should totally get this game for its story but dont waste your time with online till all of these, pardon but, 'bull crap', glitches are fixed. I am exited to see what the online is like without modders ruining the game.   'Best regards' ~Mr. Brightside42",

(Both single and online) But there are just some so dumb things in the game, that makes me so sad. It could've been a SO MUCH better experience with more caring about the little things. (Nice delays, tho.)   Cons: ;online; -p2p servers. In itself it wouldn't be a problem, but for some reason me and my buddies ALWAYS get thrown in a horribly lagging session with a guy being host with horrible connection. -The cop system is extremly dumb, just randomly appear in the nowhere (I was in front of a mountain, then I saw a cop just spawn there and continue to chase me. Aight.) -A one-star chase can be longer then a five-star one. That's pretty legit. -YOU GET BANNED FOR USING MODS. Any mods. Basically, FOV adjuster. Because you can set your fov to 70-75 at MAX. That's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. (You get banned if you use mods single OR online. So there goes that.) -Because of p2p servers, most of the times you can empty a magazine into a person, and take a whole zero damage. And then all you can see is he hits you once, and you're dead. -Basically until the mod-ban thing, there were no anti-cheat system. (Because of p2p servers.) -Sometimes mechanic doesn't seem to care about you, shatting on your head even if he had his payment.  ;singleplayer; -I feel like the graphics options on itself is useless, just like in Watch Dogs. I get the same FPS on 800x600 lowest settings, then on 1920x1080 everything high. How is that possible even? -The vehicles you buy, you have to take care of them. Otherwise, you just lose them. (AFAIK, there's no option like online to get it back... Sadly.) -Sometimes random events (one npc stole money from another, etc.) are just straight up not working. You return the stuff, the npc that got robbed just despawns. (Though, it's rare.)  Cons that are common in both single, and online: You can't aim straight up. That is really dumb. The FPS mode because of the low FOV can easily cause motion sickness. (First game that caused me motion sickness in 10 years that I played..)  On the other hand.. pros:  ;online;  -Fun online, if you're getting paired with a good host. -Different races (land, bike, sea, plane). -THEFT PROTECTION, AND INSURANCE. This is what the singplayer is missing. If your vehicle gets destroyed, you can just call MMI, and they'll provide you with the same car. (Usually other players blow up your car, in that case if it has both (protection and insurance) they'll pay some money (1% of the car's price?) and you can call MMI to get it back free. -Mechanic brings you a selected car from your garage if you give him a call (and decides to not be lazy.) -Pretty neat character creation. You can create unique characters with it. -Payout is quite good for the effort-reward system. -Heists are fun, with pretty good payout depending on difficulty. (And on host, how he sets the payout on the last 'day' of the heist.) -In heists, it gives you the feel that everyone is equally needed (if you have no team lives left, and someone dies, the three can't clutch it, because the heist will fail.)  ;single;  -Loveable characters, hateable kids. (I'm looking at you, Jimmy.) -The story mode is pretty fun, it has it's own moments. -You can chose out of a three possible ending, two of them affects the endgame. -Assasination missions with Franklin let's you play stock market in your favour. (It is quite OP, actually. But hey, it's single so) -It could be either con, or pro, depending on which side of you are; The autosave function in missions are quite casual-friendly. (Usually if you do something in a mission, and you happen to die, or fail with the objective, you'll be booted back to that part, or a bit earlier.) -After you done the main story, there's still a lot stuff to do (if you haven't done it while playing the story already.) (And have chosen the third option as of the ending mission.)  If I were to press myself, I could still write a lot to the pro, con side. I think they even themselves out, though the FOV and the cop system is a really big downer.  Overall, I'd say I'm recommending the game, and at the same time, not. It's fun, but it has a dark side that can really screw you over if you'd just like to hop in, and play a few contact missions, or heists.  For TL;DR people: Buy this game at your own risk, don't expect high quality online servers, it's fun if you get lucky with a host. Isn't worth 60 euros in my eyes, though. (As of being already an almost 2 years old game) and it's painfully obvious flaws.  Cheers.",

            "review_text": "Honestly i dont like this game. The multiplayer is ungodly imbalanced. Cheaters 24/7. hacked lobbies, etc,etc. All that we couldve expected.  Most of the time the fps eats the damn dirt as well, so optimization isnt that improved from IV.  The lack of bulletproof windows makes you an easy target in almost all lobbies. Most weapons are either unpowered, or overpwoered. No balance was considered in this game whats over. I still play but thats becuase im level 82, big whoop. Still fight hacked lobbiers who are level 8000.  Overall this game is one big sham, my recomendation, wait until the lobbies die off and then invite some friends. Becuase you can trust randoms with jack ♥♥♥♥.  Heists are okay, but the lack uniqueness honestly. I dont like the concept where your forced to use preset clothings on the standard option. I know, i know immersion. But it makes your character appear like a damn clone honestly.  The cops are OP. Like...SUPER OP example: Fire a silenced firearm in a desert where nobody can hear you about 5 times....2 stars....and about a 15 minute wait until that goes away out of sight.  Even more annoying about the cops is when your trying to take a bounty, or any other pvp stuff in a lobby matched and they focus on only one of you which is annoying as ♥♥♥♥.  I hate the concept of the multiplayer lobby having you show up as a bright dot on the map 24/7. I hate, i hate it, i hate it. Theres no privacy, none of it. Yeah yeah yeah. You can disabled the blip with lester. But seriously, when has 1 minute honestly made a ♥♥♥♥ing difference? NOWHERE! My opinion, only allow friends/crew to see your blip. You can keep the nametags up, but why the hell would you add a ♥♥♥♥ing blip permanently? Worst concept i've ever seen in my life. I can see it being only usefull on bounties, friends/crew (as mentioned beforehand.), and players with a high hostility rate. Otherwise, its just a terrible concept.  Even more complaints on weapon balance is that rockstar doesnt know WTF their doing. Their version of balancing the weapons is adding free dlc weapons, which are superior to the vanilla weapons, that can be unlocked at the very 1st rank. Example is a lock on missle....the ♥♥♥♥ing thing has more damage than the rpg. Yet it has the ability to lock onto people. Welp, there went balance out the window. Now instead of using a rank lock we might as well be giving miniguns as ♥♥♥♥ing candy.  Honestly, dont pay $60 for this in its current state, dont even pay $40...its not worth it...the story is pretty decent, but the MP is just thrown out of propertion. Its a failed state of deciding it wants to be, call of duty with permanent UAV mode on, battlefield name spam 4, the sims (towards customization and money game),hardline's cops and robbers, and a socialness game. It makes no ♥♥♥♥ing sense.....oh not to mention in GTA online you have the durability of a god damn cracker, yet hacked lobby levelers can withstand about 3 shotgun blasts point blank and/or more than half of a AR mag to the chest.  With the introduction of heists, everyone is just a damn zombie. instead of brains though their feeding on the most BOOOOOOORING gamemode that is now overused. The heists themselves dont even give you that much RP, and just mostly money. Even then you'll fail about 90 times on just the 2nd heist unless you have level 100s. Meaning your better off doing missions, its faster, and more lucrative in the end.  Also the game gets grindy AS ♥♥♥♥ later levels. About 80-100 you'll do about 20 heists fully before you get to 100. In a way its almost like rockstar WANTS you to cheat, just so they can ban all of their own player base.  Oh and no MP modding, disappointing. But with the current situation of cheater lobbies, i'm actrully agreeing.  EDIT: 10/16/25  Still would not recommend it, now all you play with are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who kill you for no reason and even in mission they run into your car. Destroy it. Or run you over to death.  Another major developed issue is ping on freeroam and missions. Its been a growing problem since release and now its worse than ever.",

            "review_text": "I played about 80 hrs on the PS3 and LOVED the single player campaign. Then I bought the PC edition because I liked the idea of GTA Online, but wanted a keyboard and mouse to be competitive. Well played, Rockstar.  1.) Load times were absolutely ridiculous.  I don't have this problem on any other games except this one, it's probably the P2P nature of the multiplayer. I'm talking 3-4 minutes until the map loaded...before and after every single mission. Since the early missions take about 10 minutes, to me this felt just like TV with a 1:2 ratio of ad time to entertainment time. The ad time in this case is the GTA:O backgrounds and a small rotating icon in the bottom corner.  2.) Controller vs keyboard issues.  a. I want to play the driving parts with a controller, and shooting parts with a mouse. I got kicked many times because I would use the controller to join the match, then it would say I am using a controller, and the game owners kick me because using a controller for GTA:O PC edition is ♥♥♥♥ing noob. Teaming up with strangers is really frustrating and it started to get forced upon me really early in the mission sequence.  b. Many of the games I wanted to join would require me to turn on 'auto-aim assist' as the host requested, which as a veteran gamer I will not do. It would be like telling Barry Bonds that he has to use a T-ball stand each time he hits the ball from now on.   3.) Hackers.  None of the records mean anything. You'll see 'world record for this 2-lap race: 0.0001 seconds' and it never gets fixed. I heard a lot of reports of people being banned for using voice-chat programs, and still see at least 1 hacker in every single game I joined.   4.) Hidden costs.   If you really want to enjoy all this game boasts, you either need to invest hundreds of hours grinding, cheat, or buy the shard cards.    TL:DR; I really loved the single player, and would recommend buying the single player game to anybody who hasn't played it yet... it's really fun! At this point, however, I can not recommend GTA:Online and that's where they're putting the entirety of their effort. They are not banning hackers or implimenting paid DLC which you could just play right away, or introducing a police mode, or any of the other things their fans are wanting. They are instead releasing update after update catered to the game's hackers and billionaires in an attempt to sell more shark cards.  Buyer beware...",

If you kill the wrong person or mug the wrong guy you will have all your guns suddenly dissapear and all your cars explode and be frozen in a jail untill you leave the game. I would love online if they could fix the hacking issue. There is no challenge to save or grind missions because you can just ask a hacker for a few billion dollars easy pz. 1/10 would not play online again. (EDIT) They fixed the hacker problem, but now in online if you destroy someones car while trying to kill them because they have a package, you have to pay their insurance, this may not seem too bad, but when you go after alot of people for they stuff, and end up destroying their cars, it becomes not worth it, because if you destroy any super car you have to pay around 20k, i once lost 300K in 1 day and became broke because i was trying to level up by eliminating enemy organizations.",

To no avail. £40 down the drain, I suppose it will probably be fixed down the line in a patch somewhere but a search on the net shows plenty of threads with people with the same issues dated 3 weeks ago, but this is one of them games I doubt I'll come back too at a later date.  I read the bad reviews before purchasing this, even my spidey sense was tingling with this one and I still went a head and bought it anyway (at full price too...) - up to you if you want to risk it and buy this game but I ignored the reviews and my own gut feeling and am now regretting the decision.  ... from what I did see though, the game 'looks' absolutely fantastic. I was itching to see what it would run like on my now middle aged gaming rig but that 780ti lurking in there still chews through most stuff with ease. The game ran at what looked like fairly maxed out settings at a smooth 60fps. The reflections in the cars at night I found particularly eye catching.  At one point I noticed some mountains in the distance. So I caught some dude at the traffic lights, proceeded to beat him to death in the street with my bare hands, stole his motor cycle and headed for the hills. After a few mins of some crazy motorcycle action on the back wheel on the wrong side of the road (much like Kerby Lonsdale on a sunny Sunday afternoon really ;) -jk ) I reached the foot of the mountains, a bit worried that the sports bike would not be up to the job of an off road mountain climb I ventured fourth anyway. My trusty steed held the ridge line like a mountain goat and soon I was at the summit, well, high up anyway. About 100 yards to the right of the (I think) 'VINEWOOD' sign. As you look out over the city below the view you are greeted with is nothing short of spectacular! I can't wait to see some of the sunsets.  Only, when I can play :(  I think I'll give it another half an hour of trying to get it working, then I'm gonna go play tf2. I'll update this review if I get it working. In this case - no news is bad news.  EDIT :  Ok, update time! Deleted the local content before I went to bed and re-downloaded the game. Upon testing this morning the same loading screen issue :( anyway I got fed up and wrote a ticket to Rockstar about the problem. Checked back on GTA and it was still stuck on the loading screen so I went and got my car from the repair shop did a bit of shopping and when I got home the game had loaded! Looks like I might just be looking at a 15min plus loading time, it might be longer, it had only been 'loading' for 15 mins when I left the house, I was gone for about an hour. Hope it's just the game settling in.  The game itself is running great. Just completed a couple of missions. The ability to switch between joypad and keyboard &amp; mouse is superb, absolutely seamless. Even the onscreen hint icons change on the fly. Dropping the joypad for the shooting sections and grabbing the mouse is brilliant.  I've even got the 'Self Radio' working, was running a mission listening to an old rave tape of mine from back in the early 90's. The problem with it though is there is currently no option to set the Self Radio as default, so every time you get into a different car you have to re-tune the radio, there is also no way of turning off individual radio stations (I'm sure this used to be an option...) ok, so it might be a small irritation. But it is irritating me.  No worries you would think, this is PC - something like this will be modded in a matter of seconds. Sadly NO. Rockstar in their infinite wisdom have banned modding entirely, even for single player.   Looks like they have been pretty liberal with the ban hammer too.  This decision is quite frankly gutting. Rockstar, this is PC - not console. I understand your decision regarding the multiplayer aspects but for single player? Come on - disable achievements etc and let the community mod it to death.  So, in a show of solidarity with the modding community this review will remain negative until Rockstar pull their heads out of their arses and let the community mod the game.",

Whatever**  Let me start off by saying: I have been an avid GTA fan since playing my first and all consequent playthroughs of GTA III. They are amazing games, have always had stories that kept me wanting more and a great balance between good humour and serious game-play. GTA V is no exception to this, in fact, it hits a home run better than any subsequent game in the series.   I originally bought GTA V on X-Box 360. I got the collectors edition, with the spiffy LS Cap and money bag. I took the week off work and I didn't leave the couch, except for bare essentials, for three days. I lived GTA V for those three days.   Time came, the X-Box One was released, eventually R* released GTA V for that. So I bought it. The X-Box One wasn't what it should have been at release (another story for another time), so I ended up with a PS4 instead. I bought GTA V for that. Then, I decided to purchase another X-Box One. GTA V followed. Then a new graphics card, so I now have GTA V on PC. I love the game. It's a personal favourite.   However, GTA Online is broken. It's that simple. Too many hackers dropping money, being invincible, blowing ♥♥♥♥ up. I had 5 million+ dropped on me, which for a day or two was absolutely awesome. Then it got boring. What's the point in doing missions/jobs/races when I have nothing to work for?   The servers are rubbish, often having drop-out issues, 'kicking' everyone from my lobby (actually kicking me but being subtle about it). The DLC is fast becoming pointless. It's too expensive and not anything new. There have been no updates for the story, either.   I've spent a lot of money on this game, on in-game cash too (queue desperate loser comments, blow me) for it to be this broken. Improve it. You're good at what you do, R*.

Don't go online, or do it with friends.  Edit: 20/10/2015  New patch, game broken again... ERR GFX D3D INIT is back 1050.3 Error is back... Good job rockstar!  Edit: 12/07/15  It apears that the latest update introduces a 'anti-cheat' program that impacts dramatically the performance of the game.  While this would apear to be good news, cheaters can still use scripts undected in online while regular players NOT using mods suffer the consequences. Good job Rockstar  Edit: 10/07/15  'Ill gotten gains' 'DLC'  Yey free content... Nope another game breaking update that introduces stuttering back again... Thanks Rockstar",

            "review_text": "The game itself is awesome, even if the story is bad compared to the previous chapters and the missions are so short and easy. Playing singleplayer is great and you never get tired with all the activities you can do in the map. I really love exploring the sea and the wild life in the forest. I've waited 5 years for playing this game (since the first trailer), and my waiting was worth.  On the other hand, the multiplayer is completely GARBAGE! - Hackers - Has the ♥♥♥♥♥est matchmaking system I've ever seen. With over 40.000 players in-game DAILY, I rarely see a lobby with more than 3/4 players (in a lobby for 16 to 30 people). 90% of the times are lobbies with 2 players, and don't even try to create your own lobby, because NOBODY ever join. NOBODY! - Hackers - 8 years old kids - Hackers - Russians shouting in the microphone - More ♥♥♥♥ING hackers ...and R* doesn't care at all. Also, if I consider that they told to the modders that were doing another GTA V multiplayer mod to stop developing it, is making me cringe. So what are you waiting for fix this multiplayer and make it decent and playable? If you spend a part of your BILLIONS made with this game, for adding an anti-cheat and improving the matchmaking system, it will not be a tragedy. I never had fun on this multiplayer yet, and is not even 1/20 epic like Multi Theft Auto (GTA San Andreas multiplayer mod).  So, why I'm not reccomending this game? Because it's now worth the actual price (60€) for what it has to offer. The multiplayer is the main cause of all the bad reviews, and after 1 year since the release on pc, nothing is changed. Just buy the game ONLY during sales and if you want to play singleplayer... FOR NOW.",

You can expect every p2p created game session to have at least one cheater that will crash your game, risk getting you banned by dropping money on you, ruin your experience, grief you, etc.   The developer does not put time or effort into removing cheaters from the online game and it would be a simple fix but the money they make from people re-purchasing the game is of more interest to Rockstar than actually fixing the issues in their product for the legitimate players.  Unfortunately they make games with stellar gameplay aside from the blatant issues with the online.  As long as you don't mind being let down by the developers in GTA online, it's worth a purchase.

Was in a game last night where hackers spawned the space jets and hyrdas at the airport. We all flew around, Screwing around in passive, and nobody got butthurt. That's a one-in-a-million case however, And you mostly get dumb ♥♥♥♥♥ that spawn campfires in your torso, causing you to burn to death upon spawning. True story, actually.   The campaign is great, really impressive story, though maybe not as good as others. Still very well done, mind you. The charaters are really lovable, will make your sides ache with laughter at times, and other times bewilder you. There are many knacks to the single player game, such as the stock market and Lester's assasinations, that really let you squeeze some extra gubbins out of the game, provided you have the know-how.   HOWEVER: Users looking to buy, BE WARNED. Rockstar bumped the base price up of the game during the sale, or paired it with other useless trash that you don't really want AND THEN put it on sale for the same ridiculous price for a game most of us have already purchased for our dusty consoles: 60 god-damn dollars. This is in violation of several laws and regulations, and on top of that really shames rockstar. On top of that, the fact that the game is paired with these 'shark cards': which are effectively in-game cash, causes the purchase to count as a microtransaction. It is therefore NON REFUNDABLE. We know that game comapnies and buisnesses can be greedy, but this takes it to a whole new level. I have never before witnessed such a ♥♥♥♥ sucking move by ANY game company, no matter how greedy said company was. If Rockstar gets called out for this and fined, shut down even, I would go far as to say I would be laughing at them.    Overall, my ratings are as follows:    Online: 7/10, because I love chaos. any SENSIBLE person who wants to enjoy it, then I'd give it a 4/10   Campaign: 8.5/10. Some things could have been done better, but a really outstading game  Customer service: -1337/420. These corperate jackasses pulled a ♥♥♥♥ move bigger than the moby ♥♥♥♥ himself. I and three friends own this game, with many more that hopefully awaited the summer sale to get this game. With rockstar pulling such a greedy ♥♥♥ move, I don't see any more friends laying down 60 bucks to get this game any time soon.   Total:    I'd give this game, with everything taken into account, a 3.75/10. This game could be great, but not just rockstar's greed, but lack of action towards hackers and other pests of the game. They simply sit at their desks, blankly staring at the screen, ♥♥♥♥ out and excrement dripping down their arms as they mindlessly program the next DLC.    EDIT: SInce the time of writing, Rockstar has put the base game, that is, the game only and none of their extra bullcrap, up for purchase at a non-sale price. They could have made loads of extra money if they had just put their base game on sale, but that doesn't look like it will be happening anytime soon. Pity the poor sods that went ahead and bought the game and packs on 'sale', as I'm sure there were some who did. In the long run though, it's Rockstar that will take the hit for this, as I'm sure not just me, but a lot of valuble customers and GTA veterans are thouroughly peeved by this little stunt.",

I would basically need to pirate a separate version of the game, waste another 60 GB of hard drive space, and risk injecting all sorts of malware into my rig in order to enjoy the modding scene I've loved since early GTA 4 without Rockstar's cash-layered boot up my ♥♥♥.",

Put since then rockstar made up their mind about mods and now you can mod all you want in the single player without the fear of getting banned I thought I´d make a proper review (I know I am late). First let me talk about the single player. I think even though the single player isn't perfect it is still a damn good experience with a nice story line and good game play. Its not just drive to point a kill some dudes and come back or get this guy to safety no they have really nice variety with heists, three different characters and a ton of just small nice missions to make the game not monotonous. Overall the single player is nice and is not going to disappoint you if you played previous GTA´s. But now you might ask yourself why does he still give a negative review and that is because of the multi player! In my opinion the multi player is one of the worst mp´s if ever played. I mean i cloud excuse the long loading times every time you start a mission and the ridiculous wealth system if the missions where just any good but they aren't. To be fair races can be fun but only if you play with friends who you can talk to and rage each other at. Death match is extremely unbalanced because people who play with controllers have a huge advantage with aim assistance over people with mouse/keyboard. Heists. They are properly the worst thing on my list. 1.) if you don't have friends to play with don't even touch heists because in some you need to coordinate and everyone knows how that ends. Also if one player disconnects you can start all over again (This dindn´t just hapen once). 2.) The game play. In short 70% driving 30% actual objective. In every mission you have to drive to the objective and when you are finished you can drive back. Every. Single. Time. So now let me come to the wealth system. It sucks. Badly. Every bullet you shot in- and outside of missions you have to pay for and they are not cheap. Also you have to buy every gun in the game which aren't cheap either. Even though there are some good vehicles that spawn on the map most good you have to buy (so a veteran player is always going to destroy you even if he is worse then you). So now let me come to my conclusion: If you want to play the single player go for it if you are going for the multi player do think twice.",

I spent the last 30 minutes trying to get into a race without being picky, so the first race I get into I wait 5 minutes for the game to start, and when we finally start it's just bumper cars, and can barely be called a race, when we are done with that people vote for open world, and I have to through another long loading screen, after which I load another race which has horrible settings as well IMHO, after that were done 30minutes had past.

The bundle was a Shark card + the game.   The Shark Card only gives you 1.25Million in game whilst making the game cost 20 dollars extra so that they could continue selling the game for the original 60 dollars. 1.25Milion is enough for one large apartment in multiplayer. In singleplayer you get an easy 150Million for just doing the campaign. This is a huge ♥♥♥♥ing scam. Don't bother with this trash.

Rockstar NEEDS you to know you are playing a ROCKSTAR game and that it is just a game, even though you already knew that), then the game loads pretty snappy.  The online part is just the worst. Don't buy this game for online.  Loading takes forever (My machine: i7 4.4Ghz, Samsung SSDs, GTX 980, 75mbps down - 15mpbs up cable. There isn't a single game, other than GTAV, that I own that I can't load up and be playing in less than 5-15 seconds). Routinely takes me 1-2 minutes to connect and be set to play. Anything you do except playing in that session requires another load cycle of 1-2 miutes.   A quick, accurate, account of how your time is spent online:   40% of your time 'loading' (at least),  35% 'waiting for players' if you do the heists,  10% dealing with mic spamming cheaters,  15% actually playing the game online.  No joke - I just got done 'playing' for 2 hours and only spent 15 minutes actually playing..  To give you an idea of how cluseless Rockstar is about online gaming:   If you try to join a heist session that is full, you wait to connect (sometimes quick), then it tells you it is full, then you wait to load into a different open-world session....   Yes, It logs you out of your current open-world session to check if the heist session you wanted to join is full. If it is not full, you end up waiting 10-20 minutes for the invite/find players to find anyone who even wants to do heists anymore. If it is full you wait 1-2 minutes while you reconnect to a completely different open-world session.  The record times in online races (that would take a minimum of a minute or more) are just a few seconds to 15 seconds. Rockstar doesn't care.  3 out of 4 open-world sessions you log into contain ~blatant~ cheaters. If you kill a cheater fairly, they start teleporting bombs to all the players and killing everyone in the session like a little baby. Or they turn on all kinds of crazy weapons and just ruin you, like being able to fire rockets from cars, blow you up directly, etc... Rockstar doesn't care.

About 6 months ago I got fed up with how much R* is pushing shark cards and cheated, when I got banned for it, I took my punishment and vowed never to cheat again and I never have. I still think they push shark cards too much, but I still tried to play the game. Today, I got banned the moment I joined a random heist. I joined this heist and got banned IMMEDIATELY. I haven't cheated since that first time, and have since uninstalled and reinstalled, so I know that I don't have any residual cheat engines installed. If there was a reason for my ban at all, it was because I joined a loby with someone cheating, and the new overzealous automated ban hammer banned me. That wouldn't be so bad if you could appeal to R*, but you can't. You get this message, 'Hello *************,  Thank you for contacting Rockstar Support. GTA Online bans are triggered by a number of factors, including modding in GTA Online, exploiting or abusing game mechanics, manipulating protected game data and code, or otherwise interfering with other players’ gameplay experience. If you are banned from GTA Online, your ban expiration date is shown in the lower-left corner after being returned to Story Mode following an attempt to play online.  We generally do not overturn temporary bans nor can we guarantee individual responses to any temporary or permanent ban appeals; however, we will review any evidence you submitted and take it into consideration. No further information is required from you at this time, and this ticket will close on its own.  Best regards, Rockstar Support'  There's no functional appeal system, if you submit a support ticket, you just get the exact same email again, and it marks your support ticket as solved. The actual story mode is relatively good, but the online is where the game shines. . . er. . . shone. I prefered when they just let the hackers run rampant and didn't accidentally ban people doing nothing wrong. R*'s extreme lack of empathy for it's userbase has driven me away. I'm so dissapointed it's palpable.  I'd recomend this game if rockstar cared about it's users, but it's gotten to he point where R* sees us as nothing more than a wallet, and I don't want to be a part of that anymore.

            "review_text": "TL;DR Review: GG Rockstar, GG.  Longer Review:  While I did enjoy GTA, I believe it makes a great example for how flawed the Steam review system is, this game is not bad enough for me to 'dislike' but in no way good enough to recommend.  Both Single Player and Multi Player boast with a huge world filled with different activities for you to explore. And, especially in GTA: Online, you will find races, missions and of course the heists scattered around the map. Yet, somehow the world manages to still feel empty to me, when playing a game called 'Grand Theft Auto' the last thing I want is all the deathmatch nonsense I find around the map, most missions are too simple to be truly as good as the single player, and thus they bleak in comparison. The races can be fun when they are made by the community or if they generally include crazy jumps and stunts. But most races (especially air races) will end up being won by the person that started first.  So? What can you do in GTA: Online? The answer is simple, not much, while I had a lot of fun with a few of the races, I spent mos of my time buying clothes, modding my cars, getting tattoos and of course, doing the much anticipated Heists. That was the most fun part of the MP as they had some form of 'story' coming with some well made cutscenes and good dialogue (if you can call it that) that made them compelling. And, even the actual gameplay, the killing, driving, flying, etc. worked well in that context. It was fun, or it would have been, but I'll come to the negatives later.  OK, we talked about the MP, how was the SP though? Fun, honestly, even though I had basically no choice when it comes to customizing the characters, Michael, Trevor and Franklin, it didn't make the mistakes Online did, providing the player with a lot of fun main and side missions, the story wasn't too cliche even though a lot of the gameplay seemed like it was intended as a tutorial for the MP. Last, but not least, the world (SP and MP), was beautiful, the landscapes, the night sky, all of it was breathtaking. So much in fact that I once went to the beach just for the sake of swimming.  So, until now it seems like a fine game, why the thumb down? GTA has problems, major problems, despite being originally released two years ago. First off, the lack of content, I already touched on that before, but again I have to say that most of the stuff you can do is kinda boring, and in both SP and MP heist set up missions are basically mundane tasks.  Speaking of heists, you remember when they said that the player could choose how to proceed? Yup, totes true, in SP. And, let's not forget that the choices are ALWAYS binary. Seriously, the Heists could be fun if you didn't have to replay every setup mission 1000x because of either bad teammates, connection or some other silly thing that has nothing to do with the actual game. Also, the stock market is a terrible feature that is tied to missions and will essentially only be of any benefit when in that context.  What else? Well the progression system is quite bad. I'm rank 20 something and I'm almost done with everything I want to do in that game, too bad one of those things is to get a minigun (a fun weapon I have to admit) that I can only get when I'm LVL 120. Yup, have fun doing only races for three months do achieve that. But the worst part is the car mod progression, of which some is not tied to rank. As I mentioned, I like tuning cars, well, you HAVE to do races for that. Again, have fun with that if you don't like racing.  But the greatest of all problems are still the bugs, performance, connectivity issues and more, oh you finally found a session? Whoops, to bad, we lost connection. People unable to get into cars because of sudden lag, people ONLY starting to lag when in cars with other, crashing, that one guy that is level 12000 and thus has four times more life than me (great game mechanic) that is in the same session. Why? Why don't they just have a server browser? And, of course the most recent bug I have experienced, and also the most recent one, in fact it's the reason that I'm writing this review (bias much?), is the one that locked me outside my account. Yup, can't login. GG Rockstar, well played.  To conclude:  Pros: +GREAT world and graphics. +Fun even if a little dull Single Player in general. +Good dialogue and filmography when they actually show it off. +Tuning is alot of fun. +Gameplay is overall solid.  Cons: -Lack of content, what IS there is dull. -Bugs, crashes, glitches, etc -Problematic progression system.(still somewhat rewarding to get new stuff) -Overall the high expectations were not met.  A great game that is sadly dragged down by a few bad design choices and it's bad bad state. Best treated like an early access game, get it once they have actually worked on it. Fun, but not good.  Edit(Stuff I forgot, etc):  1) Turns out you can invest in the stock market and make a profit by robbing someone and investing in that stores competitors. Only works in SP. 2) You do not make enough money in MP. Heists are the only thing that make a lot of money. It still only allows for very little considering the work you put into them. 3)Game crashes when accessing the GTA:V creator from Online.",

Matchmaking is terrible (it's been 2 months and I still haven't managed to finish the second heist), it takes way too long and you'll inevitably get paired up with idiots and fail the mission.   Since you can't make decent money with missions, the only way to buy stuff is to spend even more $ and buy shark cards, which I refuse to do (but I don't blame those who do).   The game itself is amazing, perfect graphics, good mechanics, fun modes and missions, but it has flaws which make it pretty much unplayable at least to me.",

Now as a solo player myself, I will say the story mode is unique and fun to play out. You have interesting characters and you have moments that you'll love, hate, find funny, or cringe. I can tell you this now, I really hate Trevor. But if anything, the single play side of this is enjoyable and the director mode is good for those who love to roam and goof off without worries of wasting in game cash.  Online is the more tricky part. Since reading all the 'Rockstar manipulates prices' and 'Hackers force ban players' which I can see being true since Rockstar is seen as a strict and stubborn company no matter what degree of graphic-swapping or being chucked bags of money for no reason. It makes me stay mainly in my own little private server with nothing but robbing a store or two, then spending 20 minutes on a job that only takes about 2-5 just so I can grab at least 15% more dollars, it tends to get boring. Racing with people can be a drag (pun intended) when you will most likely come accross some that will run people off the road, mainly to have you so far behind where you DNF and get less money. I can't really give you any more opinion on the gamemodes because I'm not the type who likes PvP only because of past expirences of people using the 'low level=bad player' stereotype, so that usually ruins all that fun.  The whole sellpoint of GTA Online was the Heists. The nightmare of them all for a soloist. Not saying I won't work with people. Hell, I'd love to do teamwork and cooperate. But spending all day repeating the finale of the Prision Break, with people constently failing. I'm not talking about 2-4 hours of playing, but try spending 10 hours, with so many different people, failing, crashing, getting blown up, dropping out, wanting more money when you spent more than the payout amount redoing the mission over, and over, and over. I just want to finish the mission please! ... So yeah. this is really a on-the-fence review and an opinion from a person with no friends or group.   It's a good game in single player, and worth watching at least. Online is only fun when you have friends. It's times like this when you wish steam would have a 'maybe button' but since the game was designed for the friends side of gamers, I'll have to give this a no.",

Single-player is great and has a lot of variation in missions and activities, though heist setup feels too grindy after a couple of heists.   Rockstar produced a great game but is focusing too much on fattening their wallets and developing 'new' and 'interesting' content than a sufficient way to prevent malicious hacking online.",

Lobbies are full of modders exploding players, ejecting players from their vehicles, using godmode, taking off your weapons and even crashing your game by spawning copies of you at your location. Modders destroyed the Online gameplay, they can destroy your vehicles without getting punished for it... If you go around and kill people in personal vehicles you will eventually become a Dodgy Player, after that if someone decides to troll you and report you a few times or if you destroy more personal vehicles you will be moved to a BadSport's lobby only, where YOU WILL BE PLAYING ALONE... The Badsport system was badly implemented into the game, and modders are not affected by it at all. Otherwise there would be more players in badsports lobbies.  I bought this game a day after it came out and I haven't seen Rockstar doing anything to stop modding on Online. They keep saying they're implementing something to stop this, but you're very but VERY lucky to get in a lobby without a modder ruining your gameplay.  I have been into a BadSport's lobby for 2 days for destroying Personal Vehicles, and I literally was forced to play by myself during that time, because no one else can be found in BadSport's lobbies, so be cautious.  ABOUT SINGLE PLAYER: If you want the game to play single player, ignore everything I said above, because it won't affect you. Single Player is really fun and modding should be only allowed here... Missions are really cool, there are lots of collectibles around the map and secret places to search.   For now I don't recommend this game, even though I've spent around 552 hours in it. If Rockstar decides to fix Online, I'll come here later and change this.  PS: I'm not against mods, only mods in GTA: Online...",

The multiplayer is something GTA games have always had room to expand into but Rockstar did a terrible job with it to the point where hacking was bad at the start for PC and now it's rampant to the point where playing in a match or an open world server with random players usually results in somebody just spamming explosions that kill everybody on the server. If the hackers aren't a problem then there is always the poor Rockstar server performance and the obligatory gamebreaking bugs to ruin a good time. For example the game wanted me to drive a car under a magnet hanging from a helicopter.....too bad the game doesn't always deploy the magnet and as a result you can't continue until a month later when Rockstar patches it. The singleplayer is typical GTA and it's satisfying but the multiplayer is second rate.

The multiplayer is something GTA games have always had room to expand into but Rockstar did a terrible job with it to the point where hacking was bad at the start for PC and now it's rampant to the point where playing in a match or an open world server with random players usually results in somebody just spamming explosions that kill everybody on the server. If the hackers aren't a problem then there is always the poor Rockstar server performance and the obligatory gamebreaking bugs to ruin a good time. For example the game wanted me to drive a car under a magnet hanging from a helicopter.....too bad the game doesn't always deploy the magnet and as a result you can't continue until a month later when Rockstar patches it. The singleplayer is typical GTA and it's satisfying but the multiplayer is second rate.   At full price you're better off with a console version because Rockstar didn't bother to properly invest in the PC version. It's a good game, just not as good as it could have been.",

Gave them my PC specs, driver etc as they requested, but after that they did not even look at it and asked me again to check if my PC meets requirements and if I have the latest drivers. They would have known it if they even bothered to read through my ticket. Instead all I get is some generic replies to check my requirements over and over again.

It's hard to find a gentle dude that will help you doing mission, cooperate and be friends. Half of this community are childs, well if they're not they 'act' like a child.

The map is like a radar where you can see every players on it, and i hate that, why?

You will respawn near the location where you die and they will keep shooting you 'sometimes you can't believe other people' but in this game 'You can't believe other people', feels like playing DayZ only the difference is there's no punishment for the bad guy.  There's actually some penalty if you go rogue, like your icon going red on map and got bounty, but it's just that. When you're dead the penalty is gone, and you can continue to mess around.  I don't think Rockstar is the guy who can make online game. The Multiplayer sucks, it's not well-designed and well-organized, you need friends that can cooperate with you in order to enjoy it. Some games are fun to play because the devs knew how to maintain the players.  If you want to buy this game just think about it.... It might be 'The Magnificent Grand Theft Auto V' but please don't be blind sided, this series were only magnificent because back in the day Open World title was just been introduced and there were no other Open World game that as good as GTA, well Driver was pretty good too.

They shut it down to make money (Mine and many others point of view). -The Rockstar support team are lazy, and not helpfull in the slightest when it comes to ban's / online problems with cheaters. -Stupidly overpriced in game items (Multiplayer) One Million dollars for a time attack car, 10m yachts, 20k watches. -I Could rant for ever about the multiplayer.  I Reccomend this as much as I don't reccomend this. It's kind of 50/50.",

I'll probably stick around but Rockstar has some work to do.   1. The AI has perfect aiming accuracy. Even when free firing under cover. It doesn't matter whether you're hundreds of feet away or in a plane.  2. You die way too fast. It renders armor useless and wouldn't have been such a hindrance if the AI wasn't so unbelievable. You can be shot before getting a chance to aim and in some cases instantly die. It makes hard missions on high ranks and heists almost impossible. Ontop of that, you can't crouch down, only cover. 3. Hosting a job is awful. If you leave, you end up in a random session and can't start a confined session. If you stay, you have to vote on random jobs and there might be nothing you're willing to take part in. Imagine joining a random session, getting killed and losing all that money you made off of jobs.  4. Heritage and customization are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Where are the beards and why can't I look like myself or who I intend to look like? 5. You're most likely not going to have fun with the community. Stay away from heists if you're going in with random people. Missions aren't as bad but be prepared to spawn 10km away from the target.  6. Stealth is useless. Besides the points I made earlier, if you knock out someone in stealth mode without anyone in view, everyone around you will hear it. You can tell by all the damn noise they make from the other side of where you're at. This happened to me when I had level 4/5 stealth so where the hell is that reduced noise?",

Rockstar updated their policy and stated they were going to remove all modded money, which I had because obviously this game has tons of modders running loose. They never stated anyone would be punished in any way for having this money, but I was banned for a month because of this. When I came back, I realized they also reset all character progress when they give you a ban, and my 120 levels of grinding were gone just like that. But that's not the worst part. When I logged into my new level 5 account the next day, I was banned PERMANENTLY. Like I stated before I have never modded this game and never planned to as I was afraid to get banned. I sort of regret this deciscion as Rockstar has shown how little it matters to them who actually breaks their rules and who doesn't.

A good indicator is when you search these issues, there are very old threads, shows how much R* cares. -Hackers. I play online, but on my own because of this.

There are so many backwards things in this game it gets frustrating very quickly. -Overpowered purchasables.

        {
            "review_text": "All in all, I can't recommend GTA V. The bad outweighs the good, and a lot of the time I felt frustrated by the design and limitations. Ok price would be 15 euros, no more.   The bad:  Bad NPC AI: The civilians suffer from bouts of psychotic rage for no reason, and the cops are teleporting telepaths occasionally equipped with X-ray vision. Commonly an NPC attacks you for standing near them, you beat him in fist-fight, and 8 cars worth of cops storm your location like you have an excess of free baseball tickets to their favourite match. When they arrive, they'll start shooting like you were Hitler reborn. Drive away, and soon there'll be a full-on manhunt with sniper-helicopters.  Badly optimized: With GTX 970 and compared to e.g. Mad Max, the game looks nowhere near as good, yet constantly stutters in FPS, has shadow-glitches and uses VRAM like a manic graphics designer. Occasionally FPS also drops to the single-digits, at which point quit &amp; restart is the only option. Getting to the main menu and loading the game lasts about as long as the last ice age.   Buildings are props: You can't enter most of the buildings. Many of them are stores, but nothing can be bought from them.  Disappearing vehicles: Each of the main characters has a signature vehicle, which is pre-chosen for you, and will basically be the only vehicle you can consistently modify and find at your home. Other vehicles can be stolen, but good luck in them not despawning if they get out of your FOV. Often they despawn if you so much as get out of the vehicle to fart. When they do, all of the customizations you put in and paid for, are gone. Sometimes, you can find them at a 'rebound' place, but it's not near your homes and getting there every single time is a chore. You can buy garages, which hold a maximum of 4 cars, but if the vehicle despawns it won't be found in the garage either.   Inconsistent: All the main characters supposedly kill without remorse, and 2/3 have anger and revenge -issues. Yet they just accept it when they get treated like servants and pushovers over and over again.  Limited: When you get that money, you won't be using it that much. There are no new houses to build, you can't build new appliances for your existing ones or decorate them in any way. No upgrading your HiFi -sets, no new TVs, nothing. City properties are not for sale, except at some pre-chosen places. For example, only one car-customization place can be bought, and you won't be using it much as it's in the middle of nowhere. There's a fairly big selection of guns, which however are pretty similar in action. E.g. I've now unlocked three assault rifles, in which the only difference is some stats and sound. Specialized bullets are not available and cannot be bought. Very few haircuts / beards are available. Cars, also, you can buy - but why the hell would you buy cars in Grand _Theft_ Auto? Then there's also tattoos, which pretty much look the same, and some ordinary clothes. Car-customization is really the only fun thing to put money to, and even there you'll be wondering why you can't customize things such as benches. In addition, many vehicles - such as ambulances or tanks - cannot be customized at all, so you won't be driving that pink camo tank around. You also can't install turrets, rams, or anything like that to the vehicles.  Money via the stock market: Basically, the only way to really make money in the game, is the stock market. And this involves load-save -scumming hundreds of times to set the prices. 95% of the missions have no reward at all.  Obnoxious random encounters: On the way to main missions, you encounter things such as purse-robberies and people asking for chaffeurs. These cannot be turned off, and can have problems respawning if you don't do them right then. It's like back in Skyrim, when all you want is to get to the town to sell some furs, and an army of priests and talking dogs forces their way to you, needing help _now_.  Realistic grimdark tamagochi design decisions: All character stats drop with time, if they're not used. Be ready to upkeep 3 triathlonista-tennisplayers, who like to drive against the traffic, frequent the shooting range and sneak around the neighbourhood. Body armour is single-use, so you can buy it over and over again.  Self-conflicting design: 95% of the missions offer no reward whatsoever, even though the principal motive of the main characters is supposedly to get money. You'll be asking yourself, why am I doing these things for these people? With many missions, the characters have such diabolus-ex-machina -style bad luck, that it seems the designers are trolling you. Combined with the characters just accepting it, even though they are supposedly hardened psychotic money-hungry criminal tough-guys, it really leads to problems with suspension of disbelief.  Sexist: No female main characters, three male main characters.  Unimaginative: The tattoos you can buy are all very unimaginative, with the only tongue-in-cheek one being a single small smiley face. No coloured tattoos. Clothing selection is equally unimaginative, only ordinary clothes are available. You won't be buying any outrageous leather skinsuits here. You can buy eyeglasses, but they all look hipsteresque and there are no dark sunglasses. For vehicles, no textured paintjobs - such as Hello Kitty -liveries - are available.   The good:  The character of Trevor made me laugh. He was also the only really empowering main character in the whole game. Of the other main characters, Michael likes to wallow in constant self-pity, and Franklin is basically a greedy jerk who keeps belittling and berating his friends, while never arranging any work himself, and never does anything for his aunt who has given him a place to live.   Car chases can feel intense.  Customizing cars is fun.  I had fun with some of the main missions.  Some of the critical humor, such as with Fabien the yogi and Michael's son Jimmy, is pretty funny.  You can fix some of the problems, such as disappearing cars, via modding. This will get you banned in online, though.",

If all that you want is a sexier version of GTA IV with a new map, this game will serve your needs.    Personally, I was expecting better.   Typical to every other GTA game, single player content is gated behind story progression (though, thank goodness, areas of the map aren't arbitrarily blocked-off until certain plot milestones are reached. We're finally beyond that). I've never enjoyed this model, as the plot writing is usually bad (no exception here) and the mission design is mostly mediocre (Vice City remains the king of the franchise in this department). Heists are interesting, but few and far between, and some of them feel almost like MMO wave grinds. I've also never personally enjoyed GTA's hyper-cynicism, though these things will be a matter of taste.   San Andreas remains the king of interactivity for the franchise; a number of vehicles in GTA V are simply set decoration and the number of activities to partake in is roughly equivalent to GTA IV. I'm not terrible bent out of shape about this, as I've always found the mini-games to be a little lacking anyway.   Police chases are very similar to IV. I appreciate the ability to lose the police, but the lack of diversity among police units since Vice City still hurts (cars -&gt; SUVs / Helicopters -&gt; Vans / FBI SUVs). The days of high performance FBI cars, PI sports cars, rapelling special forces and tanks / army trucks seem to be behind us, alas.    The port quality is mediocre. Switching between different texture quality levels requires a reboot of the game, as does any resolution change. This can be a pain, as the initial loading of the game takes quite a bit of time. If you're running a muxless laptop set-up (almost every modern gaming laptop is muxless) with an AMD card, you'll have to run a third party hotfix alongside the game to get it running; needless to say, this feels like an oversight on Rockstar's end. Performance is okay, and options are pretty barebones (on the plus side, it gives you rough indicator in the options screen of what performance you can expect given the options you've selected). FoV is terrible and can't really be adjusted to an appropriate level. There are also the typical memory leak and CTD bugs that by now PC users have come to just begrudingly expect from any port.  It's fine, but disappointing for a product that was in development for so long.   So, what of GTA Online? If you're like me, you bought the game just for this. Much better progression system, personal avatar, no story nonsense, no milestone-gated content; this sounded pretty good to me.   GTA Online is engaging and there are moments of fun to be had, but there are so many horrific design decisions that I simply couldn't recommend it to anyone. The first thing to be said is that there's an element of pay to win here - you may purchase 'Shark Cards' from Rockstar using real currency, and these provide you with in-game money for buying cars and weapons. In-game money is hard to come by if you're just running missions, yet character ranks - which put the high end weaponry and vehicle upgrades behind a progression curve - aren't, which means player who purchase Shark Cards will have access to rocket launchers, sticky bombs, armored vehicles, heavy body armor, etc, while anyone who just wants to play the game they already sunk 50-70 dollars on will be stuck with the lighter weapons &amp; unmodded vehicles.  You cannot hijack and keep super cars as a personal vehicle (you CAN just hijack them, certainly and the spawn rates seem reasonable - but you can't mod anything unless it's your personal vehicle, can't take anything expect a PV on missions, etc); you have to buy them with in-game currency. Again, this seems like a design decision intended to sell Shark Cards (the game even refers to super cars as 'premium vehicles').   Los Santos Airport in GTA Online is completely bereft of flyable vehicles. They simply don't spawn in. If you enjoy flying civilian prop planes or lear jets around, you're SoL until you scrape together enough cash to buy a personal hangar &amp; plane (or, again, unless you're willng to pay for Shark Cards).    Compounding the above nonsense are two critical elements: the game makes no effort at all to segregate the player population according to rank &amp; available money / assets, and the anti-griefing option in the game is simply pants-on-head stupid.   Putting griefers aside for the moment, the structure of each mission is often this: drive from A to B, with some exposition along the way to explain your objectives. Once you get to B, mission progression is triggered (often there is a shoot-out of some description, followed by a chase sequence of some description).   When you're playing missions with players who have fully upgraded and armored super cars - which is most of the time - you will not have much fun &amp; will feel like you're dead weight. Upgraded super cars move at least two orders of magnitude faster than the fastest possible stock starting vehicle, handle as if they're magnetized to the road and are immune to small arms fire. On the plus side, hey, you'll get some mission money at the end anyway, even if your teammates have blown through the entire thing by the time you've got from point A to point B.   These problems are magnified with Heist and Set-Up jobs, which require everyone to get to the trigger locations before they progress. You will really feel like you're holding everyone back if you try to drive yourself, and you'll otherwise just feel like someone along for the ride if you take the 'better' option of jumping into a passenger seat of your teammates' super car.   It also makes the racing missions untenable - racing missions that you are required to win, by the way, to unlock the engine upgrades necessary to compete against players who already have them. &gt;.&lt;  So, now let's talk about griefing.   Griefing with this system is trivial. Low level players stand no chance against high level players, and once killed, you are spawn within 30~ seconds or so driving time from your killer (often without even having access to the road and thus hijackable vehicles. Not that it would matter anyway).  The implemented solution for this problem is 'passive mode' - enabling it makes you tranparent to other players, immune to weapons fire from them and immune to collisions with them (this comes at the cost of functionality on your end - you cannot access any weapons, even just to use them against NPCs. Passive mode is automatically disabled when you go on missions as a result, and is not re-enabled when you exit a mission - and because it's buried in the escape menu UI, you can often be killed before you have a chance to re-enable it).   While in passive mode, however, you're still vulnerable to NPC attacks, including incidental fire from police units attempting to engage griefers. A griefer in an armored vehicle - which are immune to police bullets &amp; ramming damage - can abuse this by simply driving over to you and killing you with police fire over and over again.   This is reportable behavior, but sending a report will not fix a session where this is happening to you, and the report function is also buried in the damn escape UI. A decent griefer could easily kill you over and over before you can even access the menu to report them, and then leave the session once they get bored (you can only report players so long as they're in the current session, and Rockstar supports demands 'concrete proof' like video capture if you go to the trouble of sending an e-mail report).   It's a mess.  ",

I didn't spend full price on this game but I am considering what I did spent to have been to much. I have turned it on time and time again with the mindset of 'I bought it, I might as well play it' but at this point I refuse. Unistalling process initiated. Like everyone else is saying the game is okay, it is a fun time with friends and to screw around in single player but the story is repetitive, you can play for an hour and feel like you haven't progressed at all. Some missions feel forced and sometimes don't make any sense and to me the whole story mode feels like it is stalling to make the game seem longer like missions where you drive a car for like 10 minutes to get to an objective, why not put me closer to the objective. I am all for realism but every mission? Online is boring because no one plays, probably because no one likes to play. As of now this is the last game of their's i will play, they go on the list of companies I have lost respect for, cuddled up all nice and cozy with ubisoft.  Edit: I decided the give the game another chance and for a while it was quite fun with mods, it ran perfectly before the last update. Now i cant even open it due to a 'scripthook error' I removed all mods and even replaced the scripthook with a new one that I know worked and it still wont run. Amazing. At least before i had the option of playing it, now it is a useless turd that i spent 40 dollars for. If steam had the refund option sooner and before i played my 2 hours i would have gotten that back so hard. I really don't want this game in my library and I am never pre ordering anything ever again because i have learned my lesson and I am sure as hell for as long as rockstar exists i will never let another dollar from my pocket go to this company.",

If all that you want is a sexier version of GTA IV with a new map, this game will serve your needs.    Personally, I was expecting better.   Typical to every other GTA game, single player content is gated behind story progression (though, thank goodness, areas of the map aren't arbitrarily blocked-off until certain plot milestones are reached. We're finally beyond that). I've never enjoyed this model, as the plot writing is usually bad (no exception here) and the mission design is mostly mediocre (Vice City remains the king of the franchise in this department). Heists are interesting, but few and far between, and some of them feel almost like MMO wave grinds. I've also never personally enjoyed GTA's hyper-cynicism, though these things will be a matter of taste.   San Andreas remains the king of interactivity for the franchise; a number of vehicles in GTA V are simply set decoration and the number of activities to partake in is roughly equivalent to GTA IV.

WRONG    If you are buying this game for online, dont buy it even if its on sale. Lobbies are full of hackers and modders that go into god mode and kill everyone and ruin everyone's experience. It is basically unplayable in public lobbies because of the hackers. I know it sounds like I'm exaggerating but it is the truth.   If you are buying for mods, dont even bother. Native Trainer wont hold your interest long enough for the price to be worthwhile. Some mods are good but they are mainly little things you screw around with for 2 hours and then you're done    If you are buying for story mode, then you should buy if you havent played the story. This game would be worth the money if it had just the story in it. The story is fun and engaging and the heists are awesome. If you haven't finished the story (like most people that own this game) then do certainly buy it.   If you already have played story on a different console then   DO NOT BUY THIS GAME  . Even if it is on sale don't buy it. Rockstar doesn't give two ♥♥♥♥♥ to stop the modders and they wont stop banning innocent customers. DONT BUY THIS WHATEVER YOU DO, I CAN THINK OF A THOUSAND DIFFERENT GAMES BETTER THAN BUYING THIS ON PC DONT DO IT  If you are buying for online - 2/10  If you are buying for mods- 7/10  If you are buying for story and you havent played it yet - 9.75/10  Go buy GTA IV instead",

But instead of buying games I downloaded them free. I just recently got another computer that is great for gaming and the first game I bought for it was GTA V. I figured since I like GTA so much and I actually wanted to play online that I would purchase it. Worst mistake ever. I transferd my online character from my 360 to my PC so when I spawned I was in my garage. Due to all the reviews stating that it was super easy to get banned by other players dropping money on you, I did not leave my garage. Instead i swithched to creator mode then from there I started an invite only session so I was the only person in the room. I completed 1 solo race and bought 1 car and took it to los santos customs and customized it what i was able to. I then logged out. About 30 mins later I logged on again to show my nephew that I was able to transfer my 360 character to my PC I never left the garage and then logged. 10 mins after that I got an email saying I was banned from playing online with no explanation as to why, I never left my garage when I was in a public room and in my private session I only did 1 race and bought a car. How on earth do you get banned for playing by yourself in your own session??? And that is why I will never again pay for a Rockstar game. Please dont waste your money on this game, its not worth it. THere are plenty of other games out there that the owners actually value thier customers and players. Rockstar clearly isnt one of them.",

Finally for the pros, I am 100% sure that I didn't cover all of the bad about GTA V but I think I summed most of it up, if I remember more I will add them in.  - Big world with a lot to do in SP and MP - GTA Online is extremely fun when it isn't crashing and it can provide a lot of gameplay with a decent amount of replayability - The single player campaign is a nice playthrough that will last for about 12 hours of gameplay give or take depending on how fast you are, and when you finish all the main missions you can still find other neat things to do. - Modding is going to be the best part about this game once modders start releasing new content for us and can provide gameplay almost infinitely. But modding right now is kind of on hold for anyone who doesn't want to be banned for adding more fun to their game or fixing bugs that Rockstar can't seem to do. - Single player random events, one of the things I really love about this game is the random events that occur when just roaming around in SP.  Overall I wouldn't recommend this game to someone until Rockstar stops banning people for using mods. Once they fix that you still have to gamvble your money to see if the game runs well, people with GTX 980's should tread carefully with this game because it seems Rockstar has not tested their game on almost any video card and it's pathetic.

After at least 100 hours of GRINDING i could buy a yacht and a t20 (when i started playing, i wanted another car since the t20 came way after) but i don't feel like i made anything AT ALL, i just grinded heists for 100 hours, i wasted 100 hours just to have a good car and a yacht that is helpful but not really important, just so rockstar could throw more patches introducing more expensive stuff for me to grind another 100 hours so i can buy, i refused and used a glitch that worked just once and gave me 100k....and got banned for 10 days. 'Butbutbutbut you cheated, you deserve it!' sorry mate, i just refuse to throw another 100 hours away grinding just for it to happen all over again.  Let's think now, i was banned for 10 days, however, the leaderboards shows the name of the cheater and proof that he cheated, (running a 3h marathon in 10 seconds) but he is alright, every toxic player camping apartments and killing people trying to buy clothes or tune cars in armored kurumas (because they know that they can't handle 1v1 on foot or on a regular car), you see a lot of modders and toxic players making some freemode lobbies unplayable, yet they don't get banned..?  The vehicle spawns were very different from the ps4 version for a long time too, for example the ps4 always spawned one mallard in the los santos airport while the pc didn't, it spawned a velum instead, why?  It just feels like rockstar wants to punish the players, it feels like they want you to suffer online, they don't want you to have fun, if they did they would make it easier to buy the stuff they release, not making it too easy but just so you don't need to grind for so many hours, they would ban these toxic players and modders, if they could track 100k dollars that went extra to my account, they can track someone playing with hooks, they just don't, and now the most effective way to earn money can be sabotaged by random players on freemode, it really feels like rockstar wants you to have a bad time   Moving on to singleplayer, if you haven't played it before, please do, the campaing is really amazing, the characters are so well made, the world is rich and fun to explore, it looks great, feels great, the pace is great, it's by far one of the best singleplayer experiences you can have, the only thing i can't really stand is how it limits you, why can't you buy the stuff available for the multiplayer on singleplayer? Even the cars are limited, it makes no sense to limit even the car options, if you want to drive the fastest cars or unique vehicles..you need to join that terrible long grind in multiplayer and NO ONE should be forced to play that garbage  However, there is no real addition to singleplayer, unless you have a Terry Crews PC, graphics won't be THAT good, if you played it even on the 360 or ps3, you will have pretty much the same experience..you just won't have the first person option, some car customizations and some songs and that's just it..it's just a remaster  Btw, don't trust the specs rockstar put on this, i had a i5 4th gen, a gtx520, 16Gb of RAM and i had to put it on minimum graphics to get 45-50fps, it's pure ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t saying that it runs on a gt9800, not in a million years, you need at least 4Gb of graphic memory to get good graphics and frames out of it.  Now, this game sits between good and bad, it is a great game, however, it's basically a remaster for the full price of a new next gen game but with a terrible multiplayer experience, i wouldn't say i would NEVER recommend this, the only thing that i would recommend is the singleplayer experience for those who never had it, apart from that, there isn't really much to cling to.

When you are a buttlicking company who strives towards free advertisment as IGN does.  GTA V sadly does not deserve 10/10 when it comes to online play.  I do not belive that they have been working on a side project as there have been claims (side project as in working on a game for PC instead of porting it over from consoles to PC) This is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t literally, game is directly ported from consoles to PC.  Hardly optimized, no matter what settings you change game does not improve frame rates or anything. I got two PC's one can run it as smooth as it gets (Nvidia card) and on another PC with AMD card it runs like crap.  But now back to online, it's just one huge pile of ♥♥♥♥, what to say other than 'LOADING SCREENS ALL THE ♥♥♥♥ING TIME' I'm not here to play total overdose game again, because that game had more loading screens than 20 games combined. And this is exactly how GTA V online feels. You will spend more time on organising games and on loading screen than actually playing ♥♥♥♥ing missions.  You limited PC version, why so many loadings, why not have implemented missions directly into lobby where you have alot of other players together playing around? Yeah you heard that right, PvP TYPE. Instead of hosted ♥♥♥♥ with just few people.  APB comes to mind, that game blows but one thing it does right is handling missions, and having players around you so you don't feel alone in a online game.  3/10 for online gameplay  8/10 for offline gameplay. Overal Solid 6/10...  Do I recommend this game? For offline goofing around yes, for freemode online yes, for missions and team play ♥♥♥♥ no it is real crap and not worth mentioning.",

I would say that this game forces you to make micro transactions in order to get new items since you have to grind about a week or two in order to obtain these new content items, cars, boats, helicopters, planes, arpartments and even weapons, I would say that the game lacks in online single player heists and other missions that players tend to play online to sometimes do solo mainly for completion, so far I would give this game a 6/10 due to lack of single player since its too focused on multiplayer missions that people have to wait around for then become disappointed in when one person leaves.  So please Rockstar or anyone who works for Rockstart just add in more AI so when people leave during a mission the AI takes over and assists in the mission or heist rather than the whole spit rinse and repeat nonsense that winds up people and makes them waste their time.",

If Cloud Services means looking at clouds then they hit the nail on its head. Roughly half the time is spent looking at clouds while waiting for 'something' to load, and sitting in lobbies waiting for them to fill.

When you are a buttlicking company who strives towards free advertisment as IGN does.  GTA V sadly does not deserve 10/10 when it comes to online play.  I do not belive that they have been working on a side project as there have been claims (side project as in working on a game for PC instead of porting it over from consoles to PC) This is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t literally, game is directly ported from consoles to PC.  Hardly optimized, no matter what settings you change game does not improve frame rates or anything. I got two PC's one can run it as smooth as it gets (Nvidia card) and on another PC with AMD card it runs like crap.  But now back to online, it's just one huge pile of ♥♥♥♥, what to say other than 'LOADING SCREENS ALL THE ♥♥♥♥ING TIME' I'm not here to play total overdose game again, because that game had more loading screens than 20 games combined. And this is exactly how GTA V online feels. You will spend more time on organising games and on loading screen than actually playing ♥♥♥♥ing missions.  You limited PC version, why so many loadings, why not have implemented missions directly into lobby where you have alot of other players together playing around? Yeah you heard that right, PvP TYPE. Instead of hosted ♥♥♥♥ with just few people.  APB comes to mind, that game blows but one thing it does right is handling missions, and having players around you so you don't feel alone in a online game.  3/10 for online gameplay  8/10 for offline gameplay. Overal Solid 6/10...  Do I recommend this game? For offline goofing around yes, for freemode online yes, for missions and team play ♥♥♥♥ no it is real crap and not worth mentioning.",

It was one of the best quiet moments I had played in a game. I entered the bar and was immedietly greeted by racist Mexican stereotypes and an ad for 'b%@ch in the trunk'.  Rockstar came so close to creating potentially one of the best game worlds ever designed, but then chose to muddy it up with dry adolescent attempts at satire. Every inch of this game is full of attemps at humor but there is simply no wit in their humor, they insert a phallic reference or anti women joke and call it good, without any punchline substance or satire.   Offensive humor can be completely fine when in the right context or with enough substance. In the original top down GTA this sort of humor was fine, it fit the game mechanics perfectly; that game strived for nothing more than to be mindless adolescent fun and the aesthetics followed through with that in every way.   But GTA5 is not that game; the art direction and lead writers compete at every second. The game world is beautiful and mature and realisticly depicted, but the humor that fills that world is totally at odds with that aesthetic. And that could have been okay if the humor had substance. It could have been a very smart satirical choice to create a beautiful world and fill it with biting commentary to imply how shallow that world really is. But the commentary doesn't go that far; rather than taking the South Park approach of digging deep into a social issue and criticizing both sides they take the Family Guy route by pointing at a social issue and simply saying 'haha, isn't that so stupid' without any wit or thought.  Grand Theft Auto 5 had two potential routes to be amazing, it could have been a mature (in the literal definition of the word) game that presented a beautiful world for you to explore and live in without the stupid attemps at commentary. Or it could have focused on and intelligently expanded upon its humor, providing true social commentary in hopes of chaning the world for the better. Rockstar can't decide whether tp have their cake or to eat it and because of this, Grand Theft Auto 5 stops short of being anything more than a few hours of fun.",

I have the latest drivers installed on my PC, my specs are more than enough to run GTA V and yet every time I try to play the game, it crashes and I get a BSOD message. I've tried lowering my graphic settings, running it in windowed mode, using compatability mode, running the game as an administrator, and yet it still crashes and I get the BSOD.  I went to Rockstar to see if I could get some help, only to find out that others are experiencing the same thing, they are also having their games crash and lead to a BSOD.   'It's one thing if a game freezes and crashes but it is another thing when the game takes my whole computer down with it! This isn't just a game breaking bug, but a possible computer-breaking one!'  This guy, CombatDurable in the Rockstar comments section stated perfectly how I felt because this game is causing my entire system to crash and could possibly end up damaging my PC if I continued, so I had no other choice but to ask for a refund.  My honest opinion is that you should hold off on purchasing GTA V for the PC until Rockstar patches all of these issues because there is seriously a problem here if GTA V is causing myself and other people's systems to crash and go BSOD.",

Main story on the GTA saga hasn't been good since San Andreas, Vice City, III and IV had a decent story but most ppl played the games for the open world destruction thing, now after several years for the console and pc we set foot on Los Santos again for some good old fun action in the latest installment and probably the best GTA ever made (after San Andreas). Most ppl know how the story goes, 3 characters: Franklin the low level gangster trying to stay legit, Michael the retired bank robber and Trevor the drug lord with pyschological problems have their stories as the game developes and you get deeper in Los Santos and Red County most dirty places.  All that it comes to graphics Rockstar ported the game as it was from PS3 to pc, you can't lower things but you can put on higher to gain more visual quality, simply it's awesome.  Music and sounds are great like in any GTA and the Gameplay it's the best part, fuelled with adrenaline during the whole game, use of cover and special habilites for each character makes this game the GOTY of this year.

I get massive fps drops randomly (down to 9fps typically), from walking down the street, to driving a car at moderate speed.  I've even gotten some graphical glitches from time to time, for example a rectangular line of light appearing around my character, and it even not loading an entire area it spawns my character in making them fall through the ground.

There are no server broswers, instead you have to automatically load lobbies so you can load job setups so yo can load missions. Then something disconnects (happens a LOT) and you get the load a new 'world' so you can load a lew setup so you can load anew lobby. Then this missions takes 4 minutes to complete and you get to spend 10 more minutes loading.   This game is not well balanced, it is ill-conceived, the netcode is absolutely horrible (unless you like playing with russians with 400 ping)   There is nothing good about it. I can't believe I got fooled into buying it twice (once on PS3 when there was no online and now on PC where online is just bad)   Avoid this P.O.S game.  The best part about the online experience is discover why videogames have introduced, over the last 20 years, abstract and advanced concepts such as parties, lobbies, server browsers and not-loading-the-entire-game-just-to-pick-a-gamemode   Seriously, this game sucks. It's amazing that it sucks so much considering the unbelievable amount of work put into it's world. There are so many things to see in Los Santos, so many places, NPCs. It's a beautiful world but playing in it is an absolute drag.   If you want gameplay: look elsewhere.  The is the most beautiful GTA ever made. It's also the worse.  AVOID   ",

I enjoyed what was there of the single player game but I quickly lost interest when I realized I'd done some quests 'out of order.' Screw that.  My thumbs down isn't so much that it's a bad single player game not worth $40 (on sale). It's totally worth that. My thumbs down is my own way of telling publishers that these money grabbing tactics are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to those of us that see it for what it is.",

Heists (main focus of the game) are boring and unsatisfying but this just depends on your personal tastes. I had more fun recruiting gang members and doing drive bys in SA.

Yes, you can do multiplayer and have a ton of fun if you do a private game with a friend, but I recommend staying off the public servers with a lot of people. No, I'm not salty because my super expensive car got destroyed, that's a part of the game. I did find it rather annoying that if you attack another player in the game, you are charge a lot of money for it. You can assign bounties, but the player that collects the bounty is charged for having killed the player with the bounty and usually charged and insane amount for insurance for having blown up their vehicle in the process. It's a flawed system that forces you to run, usually boring, missions to grind for cash just to have fun in PVP around San Andres. Remove the fines for doing PVP and it would be great fun.  I'm not going to recommend this game simply because the big feature of the game, the multiplayer, isn't all that good. If you really enjoyed playing the other games, then get this just for the single player mode alone. Was good fun.",

For some reason, GTA Online would just randomly time out. Normally, this wouldn't be a problem, except for the fact that its f#cking takes a long time to go back to Story Mode and to try and go back to GTA Online. 2. Whether I'm in Story Mode or GTA Online, my screen would just would have the worst lag spikes ever when I'm driving. At first, the screen wouldn't lag very much, but after an hour or two, I lose to ability to even control my car because of how horrible the lag spikes are. Also, I've noticed that others that experience these form lag spikes from reading numerous GTA Forums. So Rockstar, just do us all a f@cking favor and fix this sh@t because its annoying. 3. The method the Heists were created was not the best way at all. First of all, the way a player is put in a session would be useless if a player can't communicate with another player because they speak different languages. I swear its annoying when I'm trying to tell a player what to do and I figure out they speak a different language. I think the best solution is to sort players in a session with similar languages. Second of all, if a player fails his objective or decides to quit a heist, the session automatically ends and all other players have no choice but to go to Freemode. If I was in the group of people that GTA Online for PC, I would recommend that they should do what Payday 2 did and let the player choose whatever heist that is available. 4. The amount of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in GTA Online is so high that I don't even think I can count that high. The sad thing is that the amount of body armor and snacks wouldn't help you against a hardcore ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ as they mow you down like f#cking road kill. The smartest thing to fix this situation is to make body armor and snacks give you more health and to make them automatically equipable rather than manually. 5. The amount of hackers and modders in GTA Online is so high that I don't think that Rockstar care about them anymore. Rockstar promised that they wouldn't punish every modder, but I have yet see any form of righteous justice towards modders since almost every question I see in the Comment Notifications are about people associating with modders but not actually being modders which isn't righteous justice. My point is that every GTA series in the future will be worth unplayable until countless changes are to be made.",

Then the constant hard drive thrashing that it does is beyond a joke. I'm sure if you've got a brilliant system then things are much better, but from what I've seen on Youtube even the best systems out there still have long load times and in game stutter.   So, the loading times are murderous - what about the game?  The game is pretty much like the last GTA, all the fun elements that made GTA great are still missing in this version. You switch between three main characters, none of whom have any redeeming features. A loser black guy who if he existed in real life would be executed by one of his friends as an act of mercy. Then you switch to a middle aged white guy who has money, but his life is obviously grim, problems with his family are obvious and he's got a drinking problem. Then you can switch to a total loser psychopath. It's just miserable. So, if you enjoyed playing a russian immigrant in the last GTA, this one will be just fine.   To be honest, Rockstar lost the plot after San Andreas. Ever since that release GTA has not been fun to play at all, it feels hollow and just plain grim. The characters are just not interesting and the missions are just tedious. Once you complete a mission you don't feel any sense of satisfaction, just a feeling of 'thank god that's over with'. Most missions take several attempts to achieve, the mini-games are poorly implemented.",

            "review_text": "The most dissapointing game I've ever played.   Wow this is ♥♥♥♥ing terrible. Remember when we all thought GTA 4 took itself to seriously? Remember when we thought it's story was overblown, it's gameplay was janky, it's characters lackluster and it's lack of fun? Well rockstar has done it again. And this time, it's WORSE.  So let's start with free roam. You can't free roam.  Why? here's why. Because the player is weak. In GTA 5 the ammount of bullets it takes to blow out a car's tires is decreased, and the duribility of the cars is decreased. It's also harder to obtain cars. So, if you, like me, wanted to walk out side, cap some dumb prick, steal his ride, and go on a 20 minute joyride with sirens and gunshots as your soundtrack, you can't because the cops will shoot out your tires and your car will become worthless quite fast.  The cops themselves have also had a major (♥♥♥♥♥♥) buff, increasing their dammage and accuracy. A cop will now be able to headshot you (And it is ALLWAYS a headshot) for an instant kill from any range, at any speed, within their car. You can be doing 70 on the highway in a stollen NOOSE van and be instantly felled by a default first responder  Your player is weak in terms of duribility too. You have half the health you had in GTA 4, which was half that it was in GTA 3... If this keeps up, by GTA 6 a fart will kill us. And, as mentioned before, the cops are DEADLY accurate, so you can literally walk outside, steal a car, and be dead within 6 seconds. I'm serious.   Your weapons are largely useless. Ammo is less plentiful, has a lower cap, is more expensive, and your guns are weaker than they used to be... So while that cop will insta kill you, you'll be hosing down his cruiser with a machine gun and not score any hits.  Also, if you decide to go with a motorcycle, you will fall off. And once you fall off, your character takes about 2 millenia to get up. So you get zerg rushed by 60 cops and killed within 4 seconds.     Now for story.  The story is... Bad. Trevor is completely unlikeable, Franklin is bacically a cardboard cutout and michael, while the best of the characters, is a ♥♥♥♥ sucker of the finest degree. You'll play througout the entire story constantly thinking 'why can't I just ♥♥♥♥ing shoot this guy/why can't I just ♥♥♥♥ing do this job/ why can't my character do anything except swallow police ♥♥♥♥.' The reason is because rockstar can't ♥♥♥♥ing write well. The story is a complete mess and I will NOT write any further about it because it makes my head hurt.  ..Which isn't even getting into the glitches.   In short, this game can only be saved by the modding communtiy. The only way which I could EVER reccomend this game is if rockstar were to seriously buff the player, put the game on sale, and provide regenerating health. Then it would finally become fun.   Until then all I can say is Nexus community, GTA garage, the guys who did the SA multiplayer mod, ♥♥♥♥ing SOMEONE save this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, I paid 60 bucks and got NOTHING for it.",

I opened a support ticket with rockstar and they have not replied. Doing some research into this I have found that many people across all platforms are experiencing this. Rockstar made a guide to fix the problem which said to forward some ports and disable your firewall among others things. Well I tried it, and it did nothing.   I really hope they fix this but I doubt they will. Because this has been going on for years. I think they are just not worried about the few that are getting this bug because the majority are not.

But now the game has gone to sh*t modders, trollers, hackers and even rockstar themselves have turnd the game to sh*t.   So first off as the worst(my opinon) Trollers/90% of players:  I have legitamaly smashed my desk at these people and i dont have anger issues and uselly am a pretty calm dude these people kill you, spawn camp you, and i know there is passive mode but you cant use weapons or do much when activated. So why dont i just change session, well because the loading times are insane and 9/10 times i get kicked out of online and put back into single player. Also the community is one of the most unfreindly and toxic communitys i have ever experienced.  Modders:  Modders can be nice people who just want to have fun but 70% are there to ♥♥♥♥ you off and crash your game weather they use god mode to kill you over and over or they spawn 400+ windmills to crash your game over worst they spam money on you and in turn get you banned from gta online.   Hackers:   Hackers are less common but they you meet them they are there and only there to insta-kill you add money to your gta online accout which again gets you banned and even more dumb Sh*t  Rockstar: As much as they have created a incredible story and a beutiful game they seem to be killing it weather it be micro transactions or banning you for gaining modded money or doing money glitches, they seem to be completly against their community.

Example: The biggest hiest, The Pacific Standard where you rob the Union Depository. You go in and once you reach the vault to grab the cash it bugs out and will not allow you to collect the money, thus preventing you from even finishing.  This on top of, lack of players, lack of communication, and other various bugs ends up being several hours wasted.  Contacting customer support is near impossible, leaving forum posts is basically pointless.   This bug has been around over 3 months and still has not been fixed. There are at least 4-6 more that I know of.  Other things are players cheat and mod their games. Basically if someone wanted to and mod, they can make you fall through the world dieing over and over until you restart the game. Nothing gets done about this either.  Other than that, it is a great game love it, be warned though you will encounter these issues and trying to get support will fall on deaf ears.",

Recently, I had two chinese guys (no racism) attack me and kill me at least 10 times each and I killed them both twice. I used nothing but rockets and sticky bombs on them but I still couldn't blow up their insurgent for the life of me. Literally. I ended up using all my ammo for my launchers and throwables until they got sick of destroying me and left. This is because they have armoured cars they bought with REAL money and because they've both play the game non-stop and are extremely high leveled. I know they used real money because they have almost every high end car and helicopter in the game. This was extremely annoying especially when I literally couldn't even damage their vehicles. Rockstar should definitely make this game less pay-2-win and no-life-2-win and more fair.   Also, I'm only level 49.  Also again, after using all my ammo, I then lost $50,000 in game currency because I bought ammo for my homing laucher trying to get revenge. But no, they destroyed me and ruined my experience. This tends to happen a lot to me, (maybe it's just Australian server?) and when it does I always lose. There's no possible way to win against these people who have so much money and have friends. They also started making fun of me, telling me I'm bad and that I'm rubbish yet, they spend real money on the game to get where they are. Extremely unfair.",

Any game that is considered good only because of graphics, in my opinion, is not worth playing. I'd much rather have low quality graphics and a fun game than a dull game with great graphics.  Mini games... sorta. In a game where I would expect to find mostly racing and FPS elements there is very little racing and only passable FPS. Apparently you are supposed to waste alot of your time playing mini games like golf, tennis, darts, yoga, things that are not very fun mini games with a normal controler. If you wanted to play these things on a wii... sure might be fun. Not so much here. Some of these 'mini games' or breaks in the game are mandatory and extremely dull/ pointless. In one mission you have to mop.... yes as in the thing that's like a broom that gets wet, a mop. For mopping. Wouldn't be to bad since it's part of the storyline, you are pretending to be a janitor while you do other things, but you can't move while you mop. You just go up to a 'dirty' spot and try to mop it by pushing a button. No auto aiming or moving character while he's mopping. Yes you also have to (sort of) aim your mop by walking upto, but still far enough from bc you don't mop anywhere near your feet, and push the button for mop. 2 mops and you return to the mop bucket because the mop is dirty. Sound like I'm going on about mopping alot? That's because I am because that is by far the dumbest thing I have ever paid for in a game. Another pointless break is on the final 'heist'. You break away from normal control for a 2D map of the city with... idk 14 intersections? Your job is to control the traffic lights to keep your vehicals from getting caught. Boring. Then after you win, and it is either a 100% win or a loss, you are immediately caught. Dumb. So dumb and boring. So, yeah, those mini games and breaks are no longer a 'Pro'  The start of the game makes it look like you will get to do alot of awesome jobs, heists, robberies, whatever you want to call them. You don't. I believe you make 4 paying ones and a couple nonpaying jobs for the government. Still, those 4 could be really awesome, right? Well, they almost are. You get to pick your crew for the job, though if you pick anybody cheap they either get killed, arrested, or do such a poor job that you end up losing more than you saved on their pay. So, really you *have* to pick the higher skilled people. Also, something that irritates me to no end, your gunmen, especially in the last mission, don't even attack. Think about that, the final mission, the BIG score, so big your crew is twice as big as usual, 2 gunmen, 2 drivers, and a hacker. While you are fighting off the people who just caught you after you were forced to 'play' a minigame to avoid, your 2 gunmen do not fire a single shot. No, of course not, I mean, they are only gunmen, why would they use guns, right? Instead they are put to work moving your stolen goods from one set of vehicles to another while you get shot at. I cannot express how incredibly stupid that is. Anyway, so yeah you are supposed to be able to hire cheaper crew members and have them gain xp to be better in future missions but they die or get caught in the first several so there's no real use to them as you (obviously) can't use them after that happens. Each heist has setup missions, one of which is to stash a getaway vehicle 'in the place of your choosing.' Except you can't leave the vehicle pretty much anywhere useful. The first time I lucked out and found what is apparently the only usable place in the game. The second time I kept getting messages for why the location is unusable. Too close to heist location, too close to police station (makes sense), not discreet enough, on a road... On a road? I parked in a parking space? Yellow lines on either side, in a parking lot, with parked cars beside me? How is that on a road? As for the 'not discreet enough' excuse, the place that I finally parked the car? An exposed parking lot on one of the main streets in plain view. ???????  Racing... or lack thereof. Sure there's stunt missions for planes and some water races, but what about the car races? Just 2, and not that great in my opinion. This alone could have nearly saved the game.  Plenty of other irritating things but lets start wrapping this up. End of game is EXTREMELY dull unless of course watching paint dry sounds fun to you. Frank can hunt metal 'spaceship' pieces, though no hint is given as to where they are and I never bothered to hunt them down, Michael can hunt 'submarine' pieces, found 3 and then had to return to dock to unload them, in a very, very, very slow sub that took several minutes to get to the first one. Again you are not told where they are, you just sail around until your sonar pings and you get a very general idea of where to go. Considering it took me about half an hour to find the first 3 closest pieces, I have absolutely no desire to hunt down the rest of the 50. Trevor has to find a truck with pills in it and, you guessed it, no indication of where the truck might spawn. Near a hospital? No luck there. On the highway? well if it is it's pretty rare because I spent another half hour driving from one side of the map to the other and no sign of it.   In the end, this is an *almost* awesome game. It feels to me like the said 'let's make the best game ever', got 95% of the way there and said 'okay lets stop here.' Needs more racing, more heists, more relevant options for heists, like your gunman just doesn't shoot as well and puts more pressure on you instead of not shooting at all even if you get the best or getting caught/ killed with no way to avoid it.",

That means that when i try to launch many of rockstars games i get one of two different errors (depending on the game). Both errors can only be fixed by submitting tickets with many screenshots, serial numbers, and screen shots of serial numbers. In my life i have bought 1000's of games (many with very restrictive DRM). In my life I have also only submitted tickets on MMOs. I have neither the time nor the patience to waste more time (other than the hours of research i have wasted on the internet looking into this issue) than I already have. I wont be submitting a ticket so that rockstar can be convinced I am not attempting to pirate their triple A multi- billion dollar franchise. I would rather spend my time playing any of the hundreds of games i currently have access to. Their DRM (if they have any) is not so restrictive that their customer service gets overwhelmed when they launch a product and/ or patch a product.

I liked the 2d games but those were from ages ago and not the direction that the franchise went with.  So I didn't really have high hopes for GTA5. But all the reviews were glowing. So I reluctantly bought it at a premium price (£40 or something).  Well, it doesn't lag on my computer so it has GTA3 and GTA4 beat. But it's not fun. It's boring. And crazy easy. The checkpoints are good because I didn't like having to drive to the mission again in previous games. But there's numerous checkpoints within the mission. There should have just been one at the start.   And even then, if you don't want to do the missions you can skip them. But how bad a player would you have to be to not be able to complete the missions? I've nearly finished the game and there was only one mission I had trouble with. But in order to solve this problem, I just reloaded to an earlier save and bought some armour.   I can write a book on why this game isn't any good but I'll leave it here. I haven't played the online portion but from what I've read, I'm not missing anything.  Pwninator score: 2/10",

I was really excited for GTA V on the PC for many years, and this has really dissapointed me. Well done, Rockstar.  Edit: Nice sale strategy, Rockstar. Not greedy at all.",

            "review_text": "You know what... I've changed my mind.  This is literally the worst game I've played since Watch_Dogs. Rockstar is becoming the new Ubisoft.  They want to break games, they already have, and this pile of ♥♥♥♥ adds to it. As much as I've had fun playing GTA online on console, I don't enjoy it as much as I did on console, whereas the PC version... you're so laggy, you fail races, deathmatches, heists, because of the ♥♥♥♥ing lag stutter.  Rockstar are ignoring everyone with this problem, there are no real 100% working fixes. Only 50% chance of a fix, none have worked for me so far even with a decent ♥♥♥♥ing rig to run it at high settings.   I guess you could say I was skeptical about this game after seeing the specs, but since mine just about reached over the recommended, I was like 'This machine can run it with low-ish settings' and what do you know, it didn't run it very well at all.  Let's start with Online problems, which have been in the game for a long time. Destroying personal vehicles, yes, it's a good idea to be charged, but why does your mental state increase, and once on the console version, I was a bad sport for a week for no reason. But the only reason I was put for a bad sport is because apparently I was 'Leaving games'. Leaving as in... your software made my console/PC crash, or leaving as in 'You have to play with a noob team, so stay with them'... Rockstar please, get your facts right, if you've played this game for any longer than any of us have, you'd know that noobs ♥♥♥♥ you off, they're only fun if they're racing/deathmatching, for heists, ♥♥♥♥ ups.   Another massive problem with online which is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off. I get invites for jobs/heists, and I accept them. Sometimes I get a message saying 'This lobby is full of players, would you like to queue?' No... why would I queue for a full lobby I can't join after it's started, and WHY THE ♥♥♥♥ AM I GETTING INVITES FOR FULL LOBBIES? THIS REPRESENTS OBESITY IN AMERICA.  Another problem, on top of the lag stutter, and in races/death match, players are able to lag out the way or in the way, and collide with you, as well as glitch checkpoints in 30 player jobs. This is a disaster of a ♥♥♥♥ing game.  There is also a problem with Rockstar servers, I'm kicked for being idle for too long... 30 seconds to be exact, right after having a ♥♥♥♥ in the toilet, I come back to that. Why am I not allowed to take a break? Rockstar, your gaming standards are utter ♥♥♥♥♥. What do you know, you use ♥♥♥♥ buckets? Poor Rockstar, gonna cry? good, wipe those tears and fix all of this crap above.  On the other hand, good things:  Good choice of vehicles, I love the Savage, my favorite helicopter.  Good choice of buildings, stores and stuff. But I find a lack of high end apartments past Los Santos, now I may be wrong by saying this, but even in poor areas in real life, there's usually a place superior... why isn't there any in Sandy Shores, or anywhere past Los Santos.   I also like most of the graphics. Folliage is ♥♥♥♥♥, it lags. But the rest are okay. But there is no explaination as to what each graphic does, and settings too.  Over all, crappy game, I only play this to try and figure out why the lag is happening and find a fix, and if I do play it, it's only Online, I found the Singleplayer fun on Console, but here it's a nightmare, laggy piece of ♥♥♥♥.  Address this lag stutter to Rockstar immediately, it's game breaking.  Don't buy this game until there is a legitimate real tested fix, or patch for the lag stutter.  Edit 1: I upgraded my GPU to a GTX 970 from a GTX 760. And the lag stutter is much worse... happens more quickly with this GPU. The only fix is to max a lot of settings, but that will still cause you to have small GPU usage. People saying it's a memory leak and bottleneck and ♥♥♥♥. What do they know? I've monitored my GPU usage, it's clearly a problem with that, no questions asked. It's not normal for a GPU to use around 40% in heavy areas in this game. If you think it is, I hope you burn in hell you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ amature.  Edit 2: This time, I got much more lag, and so much lag... that it's near unplayable. Causing many ♥♥♥♥ ups. Rockstar needs to not only fix the lag stutter, but fix this new bug where players launch the game, and get an error:  err_gfx_d3d_init  Yeah...  Now I'm installing it on my Hard Drive, so I can save my useful SSD space for Just Cause 3, because I know that game will be a billion times better than this pile of ♥♥♥♥ which is the Grand Theft Auto. Over all, I enjoy online very much, it's funny most of the time, I get more laughs out of it than I do in Team Fortress 2 and Just Cause 2 multiplayer, well... maybe not Just Cause 2 multiplayer, but if you see what I mean. But do not buy this game until these massive bugs are fixed.  Edit 3: After fixing err_gfx_d3d_init. I got massive, massive lag stutter, it became so bad, I got under 1 fps, my screens go black, and whilst playing online, it disconnects me from my game, for no reason.   Edit 4: The lag gets worse. Only played this game for about 2 hours, about 10 minutes in I got the micro stutter, then an hour in I got couple of seconds of stutter at a time, and after that, things wen't so ♥♥♥♥, the game froze for about 30 seconds... even with FPS from 40-150...  I repeated, do not buy this game...  Edit 5: I played this game a few weeks ago... my friend wanted to play it, and it lagged like hell. Nothing was fixed in any of the patches.  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, IT IS BROKEN UNFINISHED ♥♥♥♥!  Edit 6: I installed this game again... it's still broken as hell. The worst thing about this is the lag stutter. Windows 10 OS now, and it still stutters. Can't be my hardware because it doesn't lag on other recent games. Like Saints Row games don't lag at all, and well... we'll have to see if Just Cause 3 gets this lag stutter until I can call my rig two generations behind.  Edit 7:  Well. I played it for thirty minutes, but I was only getting bored of the lag. With ten second lag spikes which make the game unplayable. So basically, if you're like Rockstar, have a good PC, lots of money, or a console, then this game is for you. But for those who can get the cheapest high end hardware, nope. You're worse than console players in Rockstar's eyes because your existence is meaningless. Rockstar's message to everyone who can't run this game is 'Kill yourself you poor ♥♥♥♥'.  End of.   I will play this game again when I get an upgrade in my PC or a new PC overall, since I can't afford it.",

            "review_text": "I bought this for the online part, and only that. So my review is for the online part of the game, and nothing else.   Remember back in the day, when we were without SSD disks? Yeah, I do, and even then, loading times weren't as long as they are in GTA Online. I mean, there is no difference if you put it on a HDD or an SSD, it loads as sirup anyway.  The online part of the game, is made up of different online servers, so when you start the game, you would expect to get a choise in what server you would like to join? Maybe you would like to join the server where all of your friends currently are? Well, that aint happening. Cus what happens when you start GTA Online, is that you will load directly into a random server. No options served. Because of this, you will first have to start up the game once, and wait for the insanely long loading time, then, when you actually are in the game, you can get trought the meny, to enter the same server as your friends. This makes the already 1min+ loading-time to a 2min+ loading-time.  When you actually get around to playing, it quite fast becomes repetitive. It feels like one of the cheap Korean grindfest mmo. In what ways can you get money? Well, lets see... You can steal a car, deliver it to the buyer, wait 5 minutes before you can deliver another car. Each car will bring you something between 800-3000 dough.  Or you could go and kill someone for a bounty? Well, good luck in that, cus when someone gets a bounty on their head, every player in a 5km radius comes driving with all their guns ready.  Also the highets bounty you can get is $9000.  Another possibility is doing heists. Most heists require a four man team, and they are the easiest way to get money. The thing is that it costs a bit to start a heist, and then you have to split the money to all the four guys, and then you gotta pay for all the ammo you used in the heist.  When some of the heists then take up till three hours plus, and you earn maybe $250.000, its really not worth it. Also to plan the 'larger' heists, you will need an appartment that costs about $200.000 - 500.000+.  When you play a game, that goot 'online' in its title, and a big part of the game is doing missions with your friends, you might think that there will be a 'group' or 'party' feature in that game. I mean, even APB got a party feature! Well, in GTA Online, there is no such thing.  The people you have in your friendslist, and that are on the same server as you, will have a blue ring around their 'dot' on the map, thats it. Thats all the information about friends you will get.  Let's see, wicht other features are there in this game?  Well, you got racing. But there really is not a whole lot of maps. And another thing about racing, is that you got to have a host, for the race. And in the host 'settings' he can choose to enable/disable a feature (thats on by default) that makes it so that every car that gets behind in the race, will get a boost to their car's speed... And the guy thats good at driving, and currently got the lead of the race, well he will get a decrease in his car's max speed. What kind of idiot thought that adding a feature like this was a good idea?   You also got deathmatch, witch can be played in a few different ways.  The old quake way, where you run around in the map, picking up weapons and armor.   Or the unfair way, where every player has the weapons witch he has bought in the gunstore for himself. Meaning that you could get in a deathmatch with a player that got every weapon and nade that GTA has to offer, while you might only have a pistol and a rifle. It's a 'really' fun mode to play in.  After having played the game myself, and having talked with friends about it. I'm NOT recomanding anyone to buy GTA Online.  You kinda would expect a game that has gotten so much media covering, to bring something new to the table, right?Well it doesn't. You might as well go and play APB (All-points bulletin), since it got mostly all the same features as GTA Online has. And before you come here and say that APB is a free to play buy to win game, think a bit about the fact that you can buy ingame money through Microtransactions in GTA as well.",

            "review_text": "Although Grand Theft Auto V is wonderful in some aspects (vehicle handling and the visuals), it falls flat on what makes games enjoyable. The story is boring and lacks any sort of emotion. Once you've gone through the lackluster story, you've basically done all you can in singleplayer. There is no amount of replayability in singleplayer and the rest of the game hinges on the disappointment that is Grand Theft Auto Online. Loading screens are all the gameplay that you'll get in GTA Online with some bouts of shooting and running around. The 5 main online heists are boring and extremely linear and also lack replayability as you'll just be doing the same thing over and over in order to scrap together some cash. Overall, I would say that Grand Theft Auto V is an extremely realistic simulation of the present day USA whereby you want to constantly kill yourself because of the disappointment you call 'life' as you scrap together cash and constantly get your time wasted.  Edit: With the new update, you're able to become a CEO. Although this lets you have a little more power in the game with your aquisition of an office and warehouse, the whole crate system was likely thought up overnight. You can order 1-3 crates which will either spawn in a truck or on seperate helicopters. Then, you're forced to battle with other players as they will get currency by destroying your crates. Finally, if you've lucked out and gotten one truck with all of the crates on it, your can just deliver it to your warehouse. If you had the misfortune of having seperate helicopers carrying the crates, you're forced to shoot down one at a time as you can only carry one crate at a time. Not only are you forced to take more time out of your day in order to get a substandard income, but you're also restricted with a time limit. So not only can you not carry all of the crates, but you're forced to try to drive across the map multiple times within a given time in order to achieve that meesly income. Overall, I don't see how being a CEO means you're the damned delivery man. They had might as well just called this Grand Theft Postal Service and given me the uniform as I feel it would've been a more accurate representation. In my opinion, a whole series of missions dedicated to your company would have been a better waste of my time. Nonetheless, a better crate system would've sufficed. If the crates were to be picked up by anyone instead of being destroyed, I would see some sort of reasoning as you don't usually get money from destroying a crate. Not only that, but a better system of spawning these crates would've been worth while. Perhaps they could've had a delivery truck that was hijacked by some gang members or a delivery truck getting pulled over by the police. However, we're stuck with this half-♥♥♥♥♥ update that hasn't provided any new (or innovative), well thought out ideas.",

The content that there is feels....rushed and slapped together. Most of it consists of 'go to this place as fast as you can.' The story script, unlike the rather tight and compelling GTA4 script, was again weak, as if scribbled together hurriedly and without much concern. There are many inconsistencies in the game as well. Worst was the police reaction to player actions - sometimes they were on sight instantly, other times they wouldn't even react to a crime. There seemed no rhyme or reason to it.

I didn't notice a storyline expansion or anything else that different from the 360 release like 2 years ago, but then again, it was 2 years ago and I don't really remember.    The multiplayer is chaotic as usual with no proximity based VON, so you get to hear every person in the session screaming into their mics, spamming music, yelling at their mom or whatever is happening. I have to say that the proximity VON is a big issue to me since heist mode is so communication oriented, I'd have figured R* would have worked something out. Aside from the desync of p2p combat and the mic spam, I had a great time online playing heists with friends and causing general mayhem. One huge buzzkill is that the Online loading and matchmaking times are horrendous. Just getting in is time consuming, not to mention if for some reason the session suddenly cant be reached or you get dropped from the heist lobby because the host fk'd off somewhere you may be kicked back to single player, have to load that, then reconnect to online and sit in loading purgatory some more. I'm saying the load times Online are insane. Other than that I've had a great time racking up those stars and leaving a trail of chaos in tricked out cars with friends Online.    EDIT - Multiplayer is filled with script kiddies that spam trainer menus and ruin the gameplay. From blowing everyone up, to crashing the session. This has been going on since release and R* has done nothing proactive to fix it. They instead have chosen a reactive route of relying on community based reporting rather than some sort of anti-cheat. If they are using an anti-cheat, they need to completely redesign it and fire whoever wrote it. As of right now I cannot recommend this game.    tl;dr   Do not buy this until R* fixes the massive issue with online script kiddies!

They also go after the FiveM mod team, whose goal is to make an independent online (like SA:MP) that could make use of dedicated servers and give loads of customization to what server owners could do with the game, which is extremely scummy. The lobby framework will never be updated either, which is a real shame as well.   Overall, Rockstar won't make Online better in terms of its structure, but will pump out content to pay for that will net them Shark Card sales. It's a real shame, and I'll continue to play, but supporting their business practices is not a good decision.

            "review_text": "The saddest day of my life. I have to write a negative review... for GTA V. For so long I waited to see this game on PC. I abstained from playing it on consoles, knowing that a greater fate was awaiting me. I was saving myself for the PC version. I had the hardware. I had the means. I pre-ordered for myself and my friend. And after all that waiting and excitement, all I got was disappointment after disappointment. The single player campaign was too short/easy. The characters were dull (Trevor less so, but he was still disappointing). The world bore no real interest to me. To escape the boredom, I turned to the online mode. And that is where the brunt of this negative review comes in.  The online mode is  disgusting . The overall idea is good, and when it works, the gameplay is pretty immersive. But the execution is so appalling. For one, the profanity filter is utterly broken. And why is there a profanity filter in the first place? This isn't My Little Auto, this is Grand Theft Auto. You can wear a shirt that says 'Smell Like A ♥♥♥♥♥' but you can't say '♥♥♥♥♥'? What is this insanity? Did anyone even think this through?  And then there are the hackers. It's like Rockstar are doing absolutely nothing about it. Hackers are so prevalent that you could rejoin lobbies over and over for hours and not find a single one without a hacker or two. Of course, that would only be about 4 or 5 lobbies you join because  It takes so ♥♥♥♥ing long to load this game. Holy ♥♥♥♥ does it load. I'd say the gameplay to loading screen ratio is about 50/50, in all honesty. Maybe even less gameplay if you're doing heists. Which reminds me:  I would also like to include the community as a point of negativity in this review, because even DayZ's community doesn't have this many self-entitled ♥♥♥♥♥♥ in it's midst. Most everyone is so bitter about whatever is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ them off that they don't even try to help anymore. There are so many threads cluttered on google search results that yield nothing but stupid responses like 'well why didn't you buy an SSD, they're not that expensive' or 'wow I wish we could hide all the threads about the hackers'. It's this massive 'blame the user' circle-jerk that never ends because everyone is still caught up in the hype. Granted, not everyone is like that, but most people are, and communities are largely represented by their majority.  GTA V was supposed to be amazing, and it looks like it from a distance. But these problems (and many more) make it a boring chore of an experience. Christ, the difficulty I've had just getting my friends to play this game - I had one friend who can only play this game once per boot. If he doesn't restart his PC before loading the game a second time, the game will stay stuck on the loading screen infinitely. Then we have my friend who has the infamous black bars that appear on the side of the screen when doing internet stuff or (more crucially) the hacking game on the fleeca job. Get snake from point A to point B... except point B (and some of the path to point B) is offscreen because of those black ♥♥♥♥ing bars. It's a literal guessing game, and it's been that way for MONTHS. And my problems? Well, if I try to play the game with a controller, it randomly freezes every 30 seconds or so. The freezes only last about 2 seconds, but it's super disruptive.   I can't figure out what the hell Rockstar are thinking. Have they got dollar signs in their eyes? Are they so cocky and arrogant due to the financial success of the game that they feel they don't need to listen to anyone? Or are they just plain stupid? Either way, this game is a disappointment. One of the biggest ones of my life so far. Never meet your heroes I guess - maybe I would have been happier if they simply said '♥♥♥♥ it, no PC release'. I will never buy another Rockstar game again, and my love for gaming in general has been jaded by this game; I have a newfound cynicism for so many things now. Congratulations Rockstar, I hope you people are happy with yourselves.",

Amazing details in all the aspects of the game, amazing story, sound,gameplay(even tho gta v isn't trying to be realistic like gta 4) but we are going into the multiplayer part. Boy, it's a mess. On the consoles i didn't have any problems because on the consoles you rarely meet any hacker or modder so it was an amazing experience as for multiplayer, but on PC it's just bad. You thought that Valve's anti-cheat is slow and sometimes useless? Ohh boy, you didn't see Rock$tar's. With some luck i didn't get banned because of hackers or modders because they didnt throw money on me or something, but they were ruining the game. Killing everybody, spawning the most ridiculous and gigantic things and so on. I won't talk about the customer support because it's even more useless than the anti-cheat. Also GTA Online became from a while a money maker for R*. The content is free in some way, but is overpriced up to hell so you need to buy shark cards (ingame money) to gain those items. At this point R* are worse than EA.  And we all know that Rock$tars scammed a lot of people in the Summer Sale of 2015 when they bundeled the game with shark cards so they can raise the price up to 80$/Euros so they can add a 25% of promotion just to sell the game at the normal full price of 60$/euros. Really silly move Rock$tar. Shame on you!  At the current state i can recommend the game only for the story mode, because it is amazing. But the online component is disease on the PC right now. I would suggest geting the game on consoles (PS4/XBONE) just because you won't get any hackers/modders and if you get you will get them VERY RARELY!   ",

I respect the work that Rockstar did and they did a lot right in this game but if you want to do anything after the campaign it can be a tedious and frustrating. However all is not bad and I have had fun times meeting people and setting up fun custom games.

We're talking, you can get banned for using the following programs: Any Screen recording software. MSI Afterburner (a Default Program with MSI pc's) Steam FPS counter and any other service that adds an overlay to the game, like Razer Cortex and such, and Game boosters too.

So pretty much when you get in a GTAO lobby, you kill everyone on sight because your head is on the chopping block from the time you exit your home. There are also a lot of modders, but I think GTA has bigger fish to fry. The community really ruins the online experience of this game. No cooperation, no teamwork, no friendly players, and no consideration of ever not killing everyone on sight. You constantly have to recover your vehicles from the insurance people who don't even pick up their phone half of the time. And then you have to retrieve it only to have it blown up immediately after. Its a continous cycle of everyone killing everything and its not fun for either party.

Tried Mp only for a short while, but i don't like to farm money for years to buy some stuff. So i will not waste my time there.",

Clearly if you have enough twitter followers and tweet at them, they might address your issue, otherwhise, their support site appears to be a place where you can look over conversations that others have had.  I spent a million dollars of the in-game currency to buy an apartment in GTA online. The session after I bought the apartment (I started that session in the apartment) I bought a motorcycle gang (bought a shark card when I origonally purchased the game) After that my apartment dissapeared. I sure didn't get my million dollars back.  Now I just want to ask where the heck my money/property went, and all I get is a message board labrynth I cant even post to. Brutal. You guys suck.",
