            "review_text": "If you're reading this, you probably saw the trailer and the screenshots and figured it's a game in the vein of Bookworm Adventures and Grimm's Quest, and if you enjoyed those games you'll know already this is a game for you. It doesn't really bring anything new to the mix, apart from some typing challenges and bosses that require unique approaches to despatch them. But hey, for us word-game addicts simplicity is key, right?  God of Word does score extra points with me for being a 100% completion in one playthrough. There's no grinding for achievements. You can realistically expect to spend about 7 - 12 hours depending on the difficulty you choose. Oh yes, it has difficulty levels. That's another plus. Battles are against the clock, but if you prefer a less stressful approach you can knock the Combat Difficulty down to Rehearsal level and take your sweet time. This doesn't affect achievements. Same with the typing challenges. Kudos to the devs for covering all player bases with that one.  Overall, it's a wallet-friendly, no-frills 7/10.",

            "review_text": "God of Word It's a fun Word Scramble game. I originally bought this for the 'typing' parts of it but the typing is really more of a sidedish with the world scramble part making up 90% off the game and the typing 10%, if that.   You go through a Greek Theater thing and you fight lots of bosses that have different neat variations on base world scramble concept. It's kindof like a puppet show? Each of the bosses has the neat little intro scene. I'm a big fan.  You can also play an endless mode for the world scramble part and the typing part.   There is also online multiplayer which is cool. There is lots of game in here for five bucks... It took me around 3-4 hours to complete it. Go get it! Not enough games like this!  The dev is also very responsive to feedback. I had some minor complaints on the initial release and the dev already adressed those in the latest patches so I'm a happy customer.",

            "review_text": " At the time of this review, I played halfway to the third boss   I must note that typing games are not my type of games. I enjoy story driven gameplay or games with a meaningful progression. Personally, I have never felt that typing games really excelled in doing either. The only typing games I feel have done that are:      Letterblox. A competitive typing flash game on the now-closed website OMGPOP. Highly stylized and did not feel like a flash game or a browser based game, really emphasised the reward of good play and competition. Lots of fond memories facing against my friends on this game and others on OMGPOP (rip OMGPOP).     Epistory - Typing Chronicles. A story driven game with typing elements. In order to progress in the story, you would have to explore and find areas that needs typing to be done. Additionally, enemies are slain by typing words, similar to a game mode found in God of Word. Also, super pretty.   On to God of Word! It's alright.    Gameplay    The gameplay is what you might expect. In general, you're presented with seven scrambled letters and it's your job to make as many words as possible with them. That might be appealing to some, but I'm not hugely into it given how it's a single player game. Most fights up until the first boss have the whole 'duel' appearance of the top of the screen - where it looks like your character and the opponent are going to fight each other in an epic battle. That's not the case. The opponent stands there until a timer runs out and if you beat a score threshold you kill him and move on. There really isn't a sense of urgency, which seems to be the opposite of most games that take place in the times of Greek mythology. I would have rather seen a system set up where the enemy hits you periodically and variably, causing you to lose health, but each time you type a word it will harm the enemy until one of you dies. Furthermore, more urgency could be added where health and damage carry over to the next fight until you reach some sort of town hub to rest and buy gear.  Various mini-games are tossed in from time to time, like Hang-Man, speed typing to kill enemies (similar to Epistory's combat), and the incredibly interesting boss fights. Bosses such as Medusa change the mechanics of the fight to reflect their lore. The variety that comes every-so-often was just enough to keep me playing, just to see what the next boss was and how the new mechanic would make me tremble.    Story    Depending on your outlook, you may be disappointed to find that there really isn't one. With a theme so dense with lore, there was literally one line of 'story' from the beginning 'till about halfway to the third boss. Though, to some, this may be appropriate. This game might just be a test of your word-unscrambling mettle.     Style    God of Word is a pleasing game to gaze your eyes upon. An art style similar to the flash game series Swords and Sandals really lends itself to being approachable by all audiences. Though, and this is little fault of the art design, this game is obviously a Unity-based game. Other than the Unity logo upon start up, menus can be stretched and text can be distorted depending on the resolution you play on. In my opinion, it's really tricky to make a game with Unity while trying to hide all of the unwelcomed quirks that it brings, and this team did well to hide  most  of them.    Summary    Overall, this is a cheeky game to put a few hours into just to explore the various bosses and monsters throughout the game. God of Word is challenging enough to convince you to keep going, but not so difficult where you'll be left uninspired to bother moving on. As it stands right now, however, I don't see much replay value in the single-player mode. I played one match of multi-player and it felt exactly identical to any of the basic single-player fights, so I don't believe that will keep the game going either. I feel as if God of Word needs a little more than just finding words with a few rules and exceptions through it. Personally, I need a reason to play a game; whether it be substantial and meaningful character progression, a story that leaves me wanted to know how it ends, or an exciting multi-player mode that shows real time results of the matchup (like Letterblox).",
