Story Our story begins with a modokon named abe, he just back from saving 99 modokons from rapture frames, and became the abe linchlon of all modokons, but he hasn't save them all yet because the dead need saving, after having a near death fall the modokons spirits vist abe and there like 'YO abe SAVE OUR BONES! stop them from drinking our BONES!' so abe like 'WELLL CRAP! who wants to come with me on a journey where you will most likely die. over and over and over agin.' and he found about 5 modokons to follow him. now abe has a choice he can give up on tring to save everyone, or keep at it, and SAVE ALL 300 MODOKONS!  gameplay honestly this is the 1st game but with a few more things in it, for example you can now take over all other speices instead of the sligs (the people with the gun) and there are worms that will kill you by licking you hole. and also invisablity powers and explosive farts are new. but to be honest they don't get use all that much. and when you do use them its over pretty quickly but it dose bring a small smile to my face. look if you like the 1st game your going to like this one, if you didn't this ain't changing your mind. you run you jump you roll, you try to time EVERYTHING so you won't die. but you will. speaking of dieing you can now SAVE FROM ANYWHERE! so you move one square over you can save and load it from that point.  overall i had fun with this game but i think i just a little burnt out playing both abe odysee (1st game) and abe exoddus in a row. sure i may have save all the modokons but i didn't feel like a modokon god like i did with the last one here i felt like a modokon king or a knight..",

Also, the controls have been tweaked slightly since the last game making Abe's 'chant' move easier to access on the keyboard.  There are times when you'll have cracked a puzzle or found a hidden door that leave you quite pleased with yourself - this is the kind of feeling you play it for! That sense of reward, being one step closer to saving all your Mudukon chums. (And yes, I do mean ALL of them. Honestly, play the game the way it's meant to be played)  Also, I noticed a number of negative reviews referring to cutscene and freezing glitches - Guys, GET ODDPATCH! It's a nifty little .exe that runs in the background and fixes all the bugs. Just use a search engine and you'll find it.  Get the Oddboxx while it's still on sale, you won't regret it!

            "review_text": "Along the same premise as the first game, the Mudokons you're trying to rescue in Exoddus are much more complex than the original assembly. Besides the occasional drunk, blind, or just generally resistant creature, they all emote like mood rings, showing red skin when angry and an off-color greenish yellow and pale tone when sick. You have to find healing rings from Shaman Mudokons and apologize and shoulder-pat to make angry ones happy again so they'll follow you to safety. And blind Mudokons have a tendency to walk into drills and off of ledges if you don't guide them properly with verbal cues. On a positive note, you can use their blindness to your benefit. For example, if a blind Mudokon is on the level below you, notably the one with the lever you need to pull but can't get to, you can stand on the side of the screen you want the blind guy to walk toward, prompt him to follow you, and then tell him to 'work' in order to turn the crank or pull the lever that allows you access to another level. Another excellent function is being able to guide more than one Mudokon at a time. In the first game, you had to rescue one Mudokon, then come back and get the other one. In Exoddus, you have an 'All o' ya' command that captures the attention of anyone present. At points, you'll have a gaggle trailing behind you - sneaking, running, or jumping into the bird teleporters.  But perhaps even better than the hammed-up gamespeak is the fact that the developers fixed what could easily be called the number one problem with the first game: the inability to save the game wherever you wanted. Not only was Abe's Oddysee a tough game, you spent a lot of time redoing what you'd done because of the need to learn the hard way. Many of the puzzles in the original required some testing before you made it through, and when you have to go all the way back to the beginning of the path each time you fail, it's hard to stay inspired to push forward. In Exoddus, you have an incredibly welcomed quick-save option that allows you to quickly save your progress, anywhere in the game as many times as you want. And when you're ready to quit playing, you simply save to the memory card instead of a quick save, and you're set. This introduces an interesting dilemma, as the quick save certainly makes Exoddus seem easier, in a sense, but the game itself is actually even more difficult than the first one - it's just that now you finally have hope. And just when you think hope's lost, something wonderful like an invisibility power-up appears when you free Mudokon spirits.  Graphically, Abe's Exoddus is the same 2D visual wonder, much like the original or, moreover, Interplay's Heart of Darkness. Yet the graphics seem much more brilliant, as there are more environments with greater diversity in design. And the cutscenes are not only gorgeous, they're entertaining and (can I say it?) funny. No, really. Besides that, the game is quite large, and the environments are expansive. You'll have to rescue the spirits of Mudokons past; battle the typical, yet enhanced cast of Sligs, Scrabs, and the excruciatingly annoying Fleeches (long live the quick save), among others; as well as roll through the mines in mine carts and such. And sound-wise, you really can't get much better without being downright distracting. The voices of all the characters are incredible, and the effects, from getting blown up by a mine to the echoey sound of falling to your death, really can't be beat.  Abe's Exoddus also has a two-player mode. While the Exoddus mainstay is clearly the single-player game, the two-player co-op mode does have charm, as you and another player take turns working your way through. When you die, your partner picks up where you left off and so forth. A bit of advice? Pick a crummy partner, and you might have some fun with this. Otherwise, the waiting game just doesn't parallel the egocentric fun of keeping this title to yourself. In all, Abe's Exoddus is a great example of how a game can stay true to its conceptual pursuit while still improving upon the original, all while keeping its soul intact. If you loved the first one, you'll like this game more. If you didn't play the first one, you can start here. If you hated the first one, it's likely because of the lack of save points, so you should definitely consider giving this series another try.",

            "review_text": "ALL OF THE NOSTALGIA!!! From the very first sounds of the opening sequence and game menu, I was instantly transported back to late 1990's, sitting in my older brother's bedroom, playing this on classic playstation and a tiny, heat-warped telly that we had to use a bit of blue-tac and a screw to keep the switch on AV (occassionally the screw would come loose and we'd suddenly be plunged into static mid-game!). My brother and I would take turns playing, switching every time we got Abe killed (which, on my part, was normally almost instantly), jumping out of our skins at the scarier parts (this game had the best graphics we'd ever seen at the time) and laughing our arses off at all the fart jokes. We had played through Oddysee pretty quickly, so we were excited to have a much longer game this time (TWO whole discs!), with slightly better graphics, and OH THAT REALLY AWESOME QUICKSAVE FUNCTION! Our mum even got in on the action, and played this with us on more than one occassion, helping us out with the more 'puzzle-solving' sections that we couldn't work out (plus she is an x-files fanatic and loves everything to do with Aliens and weird ♥♥♥♥ like that).   So for me, this game is totally worth playing, even though it definitely wasn't designed to be played with a keyboard, nor on a 27' HD screen. It brings back so many fond memories of the rare moments that my brother and I were working together to keep Abe alive and rescue all of the Mudokons, instead of at each others throats trying to kill each other. I still love the quirky nature of this game/universe - the artwork and landscapes are mind-blowing to me even now that the graphics are incredibly below-par. The characters and creatures of Oddword are so unique and terrifying. I love the 2D platform gameplay - I wish there were more games like this. Some of the levels are pretty easy, and some of them are infuriatingly difficult (for me anyway), which just makes completing them all the more rewarding :) Just don't be a dunce like me and forget that you've only been Quicksaving for the last 3 hours, decide to exit after completing a particularly difficult level and forget to do a proper Save... That ♥♥♥♥ is devistating.  So yeah, if you loved playing this game when it first came out, you won't regret playing it again :) It's everything I remember and more.   If you've never played it before, give it a go! It was ahead of it's time when it came out like 15 years ago, and it's still a unique gaming experience in a lot of ways. If nothing else, the story is fantastic. The implications and irony of the story is something you just don't get in many popular games. We sympathize with the Mudokons and their hero, Abe. But most of us, if we took a hard look at ourselves, probably fall into the Glukkon or Slig category... or the kind of Muddokon that just watches it all happen and does nothing.

These games are completely unique in their story, and perhaps the only games I have ever seen that could portray the entrapment of an entire species in such a humorous way. Abe's Exoddus is somewhat a platformer, but with many puzzle aspects. The point is to save all of your enslaved species because the spirits of your ancestors all tell you to, so Abe does just that. Unlike the previous game in the series, they make it so you MUST save other mudokon's in order to progress. If you want a game with little consequences (besides getting a non-canon ending) and lets of freedom to destroy creatures in all variety of somewhat gruesome situations, play the previous game, which I would encourage you do either way. However, Abe's Exoddus will forever remain my favorite.",

            "review_text": "I can honestly say that this is my absolute favourite game ever, and I am happy that it's on Steam since my PS1 broke down. I really believe that this game gets heavily overlooked when it comes to naming the top games of its generation. Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee gets mentioned quite a bit, but this one... not so much. Which is a damn shame, and I'll explain why in a minute.  The only downside to this was getting it playable was a little difficult. Resolution issues are the first big problem, though that was easy to fix with a quick download of a program. Now the only minor annoyance is that because its natural resolution was 800x600, stretching that to my 1920x1080 caused it to because a little more pixelated and blurry. You can still see everything perfectly fine, its mostly just distant objects or background things during the cutscenes that may be difficult to make out. Controller compatibility isn't labelled, but it  is  there, to a degree. I was prepared to use my Xbox 360 controller, but the default mapped controls for it were a mess (chanting was the 'Back' button of all buttons). Honestly, it's easier and probably better to just stick with the keyboard. Any remapping you deem necessary is much less stressful.  As for the gameplay... If you've played Abe's Oddysee, then everything you saw there was improved on here, and for the better. Extra voice commands, emotions of the Mudokons to deal with, often in hilarious ways (particularly with the laughing gas). Possession of enemies ranges further than sligs (who also now have a flying variation). The wider range of enemies, the much more intimidating puzzles, the fact that the major bad guys are actually a within bits and pieces of the game and become a mechanic themselves rather than just be seen and death with via cutscenes... and at its worst, some areas just require careful timing. The game is incredibly simple for the things you can do.  The backgrounds for the environments are spectacular, the music... isn't the stuff of legends, but I have found myself humming or whistling a couple of the tunes here and there. But otherwise the only other major factor is the story, and it's just as weird and twisted as the original. It kicks off right where Oddysee ended (poor Abe doesn't even get time to rest). And here's a fun fact. Back in the late 90's when this game originally came out, most of this games cutscenes were turned into a short film. A short film that was nominated for an Oscar. A ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥  Academy Award ! Technically speaking, the first and (I could be wrong with this one) only game to have achieved that.  Besides the questionable performance issues in getting the game going, majority of which easily fixed, I recommend this game and recommend it hard. While I'm at it, I also recommend Abe's Oddysee (or its HD remake 'New n' Tasty'). While it may be a childhood love of mine, it's been 17 years and I can still call it my favourite. I'm at a point where I can play at least 30% of it with sound alone, and I'm still not sick of this game. It's just that kind of game that I can pick up and play any day of the year.     TL;DR   - If you liked Oddysee, you'll like Exoddus better. If you haven't played it,   PLAY IT!  ",
