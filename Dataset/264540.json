            "review_text": "Platformines is my favorite rogue-like game of all the ones I've played.  I was at UC Berkeley when my classmate Ken Arnold wrote rogue. I have had a lot of playtime with it and others through the years.  I read the mixed reviews and waited till I completed the game before I wrote this since I thought it might ramp up to an unplayable frenzy. It was evenly challenging and delightful through my win on the easiest level. I am a fair way through the middle levl and have hope for me and the hardest level.  I like the varied play: radomized maze based on name chosen, crazy wonderful frustrating enemies. discovering new portals as you dash about the maze trying to reach a deignated spot, resetting health when you reach portal, losing seeing maze in proportion to amount of healt you have, and hats that alter your abilities, found gems to sell or boost health.  I love all the natural features on the xbox controller. It is easy to switch among guns  It is a thouroughly satisfying game. I showed it to my students at a recent conference I took them to. Most all are gamers, many are game developers. There was a lot of excitement about Platformines  ------- It now a couple of months later ------ I just finished the hardcore level. This game was delightful to the last drop. It was wonderfully challenging",

            "review_text": "Great little gem. A highly addictive time killer that gets you running aroung a randomized dungeon looking for gems and loot. RPG element involves geting stronger guns so you do more damage. THe game starts off slow and you may die frequently. The goal early on is to get cash so you can upgrade your shield and bag size. Later you can decide how difficult you want your run to be, either stay in teh easy areas and get loot or challenge yourself by going deeper into the dungeon. Highly recommend this to anyone who likes these type of games. The controller is setup a little differently but you will get used to it really quickly. I am an old time gamer and I was comfortable with the controls shortly after starting the game.",

            "review_text": "This is one of the few games I can say that I had to force my self to get through it to the end. Not to say the game is bad but it isn't great, and at times it's just flat out not fun. The main idea of the game is to go and get these launchers, in a very large, randomly generated mine, that place these missing pieces onto your robot drill in order to escape. It seems a simple task untill you realize how crazy difficult some sections of the mines can be in order to reach your destination. Through out the mines you'll find nuggets of treasure all over the place that range in value and increase in rarity as you stretch out deeper into the mines, which are used to transform into currency back at the base so you can buy storage and health increase upgrades as well as weapons. The collector kind of player will certainly feel at home with this feature of the game as there are pleanty of different treasures to collect. Alternatively you can use the treasures for health. Most of the best weapons you'll come across by killing off other enemies or found in a chest. Weapons come with increasing stats as you venture further into the mine so that you can stand against the tougher badies as you progress, almost in Borderlands style. Sometimes spike traps, or electrical platforms will be inconviniently in your way of teleporters that act as checkpoints, which would eat away at your life, hindering you're ability to progress smoothly. Or you might be faced off with an enemy whose just too mighty for you and will kill you in seconds, even with quick reflexes. This doesn't become a huge problem till the end game. Platforming in the game is solid and pricise thankfully. This game can offer a nice sum of game time of about 5 hours on anyones first run, but the game doesn't give you much reason to do it all again in the higher difficulties. Perhaps at a cheap price, this game is worth your time but don't go into it with high expectations.",

            "review_text": "well, it's simple, it's mosty well-executed, it's fun, it's action-packed, and it's not an overly expensive game... it's a sandbox, for all intents and purposes, without the 'building' aspect most recent sandboxes are so hooked on. you may be stuck in a mine but you aren't digging around and collecting materials to build, you're just avoiding all sorts of crazy traps and plants, and you're getting into gun battles... oh and slaying wierd creatures. all for what? to collect some random pieces to finish your escape vehicle and get to the surface world. however, there's not much beyond that. customize your character, grab your pistol and go shoot some crap.   it's really a wierd mix of contra and borderlands but far simpler and much more 'short and sweet'... has some rogue-like/dungeon crawl elements as well, so if you're looking for a mindless platformer, shooter,or dungeon crawl, try the demo. if you aren't hooked after the demo, obviously it's not for you, but the thing is, if you get hooked, you'll be buying the game as soon as you can afford to. that's what i did ._. made it through my frist run in a day's playing on and off but it was tedious and took some effort... on my second run now, and won't be playing as much, but willdefinitely be screwing around on it here and there. LOVE it in so many ways...  ",

Get ready to never finish this game because once you buy everything and you're only halfway through, that's it, No more leveling, no more platforming, just pure agony and masochism. The developer actually defends leaving it in this state, which is unplayable. It becomes luck instead of skill, Chance instead of grind. Once I got to that point, I had to look up reviews online to see if it was seriously this ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Yup. Just look up 'Any other energy belts after 3?' and you'll see for yourself. Unforgivable.",

Platformines is interesting and has a lot of good things going for it but when looking at a price to reply value it is indeed very low and you may end up playing it once and have it linger on your games libary collecting dust.  If you are interested in buying the game keep in mind that there are many other games out there with this randomized style and that offer similar features (sometimes at lower prices). Reply value could be increased in the future if the dev decides to add coop game play much like risk of rain and adds a bit more variety in mosters / objects.  all in all I would give its a 5/10 but would hightly suggest waiting till its 75% off at least if you are interested in it.",

You shoot with the trigger rather than one of the a/b/x/y buttons, which (having grown up playing sidescrollers on the SNES and Genesis) feels incredibly awkward.  And, of course, you can't remap the controls, because that would be silly. Nothing takes a game that looks fun and makes it suck quite like bad controls.",
