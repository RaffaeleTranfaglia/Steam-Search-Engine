I didn't even need to use any food on my first attempt.Their is no boss or anything challenging at the end of survival. I literally alt tabbed out of the survival match to wait for the zombies to spawn to write this review.  The zombie sounds are annoying as all hell. The gun sounds were okay not anything special nor anything as bad as I've seen.  The graphics of the menu looks like it was hand drawn from a 4th grader.  To do your quest you have to click the play button there, you can't do them by queueing into a match.   I didn't get to even try the other modes as no one was online.For 2 dollars, It's not bad I guess but not worth it for me.  This game may be some what enjoyable with the team deathmatch mode and a few friends.",

Tried playing with a friend and it just kept telling me to type new name everytime I connected and after it just returned me to main menu.  Refund it for everyone and remove it off steam. If you are thinking about buying this DON'T. It's a waste of money.",
