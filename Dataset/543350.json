            "review_text": "This is an updated review after speaking with the developer privately about a lot of issues I was having with the game. This is basically just was 'Harvester of Sorrow' said as well.  Basically the game requirs you to look around constantly to 'trigger' events to happen. If you just stared in one general direction 'waiting' like I was, you would go through very long periods of absolutely nothing which was frustrating and boring.  After talking to the Dev, he actually already updated the game with some simple suggestions that I think will definitely help people from not having the same issues I did! With that being said, now that the changes have been made and I was able to play through the experience, it is definitely nicely done. The story is interesting, and creepy at the same time. Think of this like a much longer version of The Visitor. Exact same concept, non-interactive, you just sit and watch creepy things happen around you. If you liked The Visitor and want something similar but much longer, this is definitely for you.  For $2 it's definitely a good buy for this time of year. Play through probably takes about 20-25 minutes from start to finish.",
