            "review_text": "NOTE: since this review they have added 20 or so additional monsters. I'll revisit this whenever I get the chance to play it.  I'd like to recommend Heroes of a Broken Land as it is in many ways innovative, allowing you to create multiple parties with fun leveling mechanics in randomized dungeons with a pinch of city building thrown in.  The big problem with this game is that there is no variety at all. You're thrown into a world with enless dungeons, but they all look the same, which would be forgivable if there was variation in the monsters you fight, but you will fight rats, bats, slimes, skeletons, and elementals over and over. Each encounter will be the same as the last, and it will all blur together in a forgettable experience, which is a shame because there is a lot to like but in the end I quickly found myself dreading heading back into another dungeon or, even worse, defending my city from endless hordes of very easy but time consuming to kill armies of rats and skeletons that roam the open world portion of the game.",

            "review_text": " Clocked in over 30 hours on this game and I keep coming back to see if the dev has added any new features. He's been pretty good about keeping this game alive and kicking.   If you like 90's-style roguelike maze explorers like the old Bard's Tale and Wizardy type games, you'll love this. HoaBL adds some features I've never seen in other 1st person roguelikes, including a dynamic overworld map with many features remniscent of Ultima's I-III or perhaps Heroes of Might &amp; Magic. There is a mini-game in that you have to build buildings around your starting location and this helps determine your overall strategy.   Perhaps most innovative is the introduction of multiple parties. You can make several parties and have them each exploring different places, and some higher level locations require you to actually bring more than one party together just to get the doors open.  Very enjoyable and one of my favorite roguelikes on Steam. Worth every penny, and I look forward to more updates from the devs.",

            "review_text": "A good simple dungeon turn-based dungeon crawl with a strategic world map for moving your parties.  The maps are randomly generated, but the goals remains mostly the same according to the type of game you want to play.  Do not be fooled by the graphics, it is a good game, especially for the price.  It is also simple compared to modern dungeon crawls. You don't even need any tutorial or instruction manual so easy it is.  It is really worth gettting it for the price Steam charges.",

Maps are clear and some skills add details to the map such as:ennemies/secret doors... First time i see this: You have to bring two or three parties of 6 characters to enter some dungeons, inside you can freely switch from a party to an other. ",

            "review_text": "This is a nice idea, and if it gets more content it could be good, but as it stands it gets repetitive much too quickly. The bulk of your time will be spent in dungeons, fighting monsters. And since MP is a very limited resource, in most fights you won't be able to use any special skills or spells. Just mash attack. The game helpfully has an 'auto-attack' feature to save you time doing that, but it's not very satisfying watching combat slowly play out that way.  More content would help, especially easier ways to let players actually use the fun skills their heroes have, more than a handful of times per dungeon, without spending all day quaffing potions through the clunky UI.  It's an addictive game, I don't dispute that, but it's not fun to play.",

It has a Civ5 hex map, with multiple party management and just a sprinkle of city management, though it's extremely light and easy to understand.  For the actual gameplay, It's a lot like Legend of Grimrock or Eye of the Beholder. There are some dungeons that require multiple parties to clear, and those are fun.  I definitely recommend this game.",

            "review_text": "So, lately i was playing games similiar to this one, to be exact the Might and Magic 6 to 9. Thats when i stumbled on this game. To be honest, on my first look it seemed to simple for me, like you could not specialize your characters at all. The combat seemed odd to me too and overall my opinion was mostly negative. But i gave it a try and i was positively surprised, it made me stop playing Might and Magic to play this one instead. I have only played about 12 hours, but i can say the dungeon crawling and city building is fun. You can distribute status points for your character how you want it to be and searching for better equipment is satisfying in a way. Also, the combat does feel good i think, its much better than i expected.  This game is addicting and i can just recommend it to people who like this genre.",
