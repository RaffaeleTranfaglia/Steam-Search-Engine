Love the bombs.   Con  The music gets painful after you find that you have been playing an hour AND YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHERE THE TIME WENT.  If you like a fun, play it here and there when you got a few mins but you can lose yourself into it type game. You will love this one. It's a calm down time game. Definally worth buying.",
