            "review_text": "Shiny - when beautiful graphics meet programming level of browser flash game. Unfortunately, the game feels like it's an alpha version from the very beginning. Even controls in options menu are messed (you can only move between options with stick, then press A but value can only be changed with directional button) Cannot move a character with d-pad, UI is poor. Gameplay seems to be slow paced and boring without any form of combat, just move right, sometimes press X, you cannot even jump much because it consumes battery which when it's empty you die and start from last checkpoint. I don't like it, I'm asking for refund, sorry.",
