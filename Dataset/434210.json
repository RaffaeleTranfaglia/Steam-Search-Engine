            "review_text": "It was a shame to be born with feet instead of wings. If we'd had wings we could have shared in the culture and traditions of every country around the world. But, thanks to It's Spring Again, we can share a delightful Russian artform with children who are growing up with the internet and ipads. And, here is a game that utilizes voice talant, art, and mechanics in a fluid way to engage kids everywhere. They might even pickup a little bit of a second language as well.  I'm probably getting the horse before the cart here, but this game is based on a puppet show, and the dlc (which is really a must-have in this game) includes a free video of the puppet show, along with an artbook. The artbook is filled with art from the game and the puppet show, as well as a concept sketchbook. The video is a live performance of a diaorama-type puppet show, sort of a 3D flannel board of the earth, which different stick puppets are attached to during the performance. This alone is well worth watching, though it is in Russian, and I couldn't locate the subtitle function on my plug-in. The acting was so dramatic and I'd already played the game through for a few hours, and you can tell right away the Earth is sleeping, even without knowing Russian. It is presented as metaphors.  But, that was just the dlc for this charming game. The game itself is it's own unique artform. It begins with giggling clouds, and a sunshine playing hide &amp; seek. It calls for simple exploration type interactions to find the sun, while the narrator is telling the story in your choice of Russian or English. Each changing season is presented dramatically, while the gamer essentially operates the show himself. Nature is personified, with big faces. Even 'Earth' has a face and hands. The rainbow walks across the sky dome. And, those clouds are so giggly and fun. I can't wait to play this with my nephew in Kindergarten. Having worked with children for a lifetime, teaching Elementary Science and working with puppets, and drama, I fell in love with the artform and Science of the game immediately.  The designers really put a lot of work into the format and chose to give two modes: an interactive game mode and an autoplay visual story mode. I started with the game mode, and was immediately drawn into the art of it, which somehow reminds me of the stacking Russian dolls. The game mode has no ending, and not only has replay value, but one play through can engage a child (or adult) for quite sometime, with the cheerful sound-effects and basic Science concepts illustrated for young kids. The clouds literally drop the rain and snow on Earth, for example.   The achievements come quickly. I got them after completing the game mode and the autoplay mode, though it may be possible to get them without the game mode. I'm not sure about that, since I started with the game mode. But, the cards illustrate the characters from the story, and the badges have inspiring, positive words on a color-changing sunshine. (Oh, those arms on the sunshine!) The emoticons and backrounds are the seasons, snow, leaves, flowers, etc. all in tasteful illustrations. I'm obviously missing the Summer background, lol, and will have to wait until one shows up in the market.   I doubt more words are neccessary for you to realize I highly recommend this game for anyone looking for a perfect game to share with a child.",

            "review_text": "It was kind of surprising to find the small indie game with this art style, because it looks extremely familliar for some obvious reasons. I guess it is ok too make some cute small cheap educational games for kids in Steam, because Steam is quite big to handle games for all ages. It is painted very well and reminds me template drawings, where you making picture from little drawn pieces. If you will make more games like this one, try to improve techniqal part of the games.  P.S. btw, if your achievements not working - reboot Steam.",

            "review_text": "It's Spring Again is a game based on a children spectacle, where they can participate, about seasons. The Collector Edition, which is a must-have, has the video subtitled in English of it and pictures, concept arts, etc..  The game is in Russian and in English, which means that kids from another language could be missing the educational side of It's Spring Again.  The storyteller is explaining what you can expect from a season: flowers during springs, fruits in summer, mushrooms in fall, snow in winter, etc.. Each scene is interactive: for example, the child has to find the sun behind the clouds or to make flowers growing on the ground by clicking on it, etc.. First, no help is activated, unless you click on help on the pause screen. Then, an hand will show you where to click. And as the winter is technically ending the story, there is in reality no end of the game. Indeed, you come back to spring and the cycle will continue, showing that it's infinite. The title takes all its sense: it's spring again!  The graphics are making me things of embroidery or anything that seems like it. Everything is anyway having eyes (trees, earth, sun, clouds). Also, the seasons are represented by a strange creature that is moving around. The voice acting in English is good and the sounds made when interacting will please children.  It's Spring Again is a short and good little game for 2-3 years old, with interesting bonus if you buy the CE. Even if it's in English, I do think that the pictures in the CE can be interesting to use in a classroom.",

It's rather short but repeats endlessly until they're bored of it and during the first playthrough, that took over an hour. She asked to play again a few hours later too.  The art style is gorgeous and the sounds are calming with a clear narrative voice. Well worth the small change it cost to buy and highly recommended for parents of toddlers interested in digital gaming.",
