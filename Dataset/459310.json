The most important things I can think of saying here are that this entry in the heroes series does unltimately fit in with the heroes rise trilogy that cames before it. The biggest difference here is that it is perhaps a bit less subtle in the societal topics it deals with. Ultimately I would just like to say that I did enjoy this entry in the series and start of a new storyline set in the heroes universe.",

            "review_text": "Im a fan of the Heroes Rise series so when I heard that there was another novel in the series coming out, I was ecstatic!  I bought the novel straightaway once I've found out that it was released.  But I was kind of surprised that there were a lot of negative reviews about it, so I read it right away.  And I find that its actually not that bad as what other people in the reviews say it to be. But then again, I guess its not for everyone.  If you can go pass the vibe that this story is strongly promoting political advocacies and propaganda, then you'll find that its bearable and you can sympathize with the situations and environment of the characters.  Personally, I think the main reason as to why this story revolves or focuses so much on that particular political agenda (I dont want to name it, in case I spoil anyone) is because it just wants you to be familiarized with what's happening in MC and how it would set the tone for the later sequels when they come out.  But, in any case, overall, I still find it very good and entertaining! Not as good as the first trilogy, but still, this is the first book in The Hero Project, so maybe its too early to make any judgments.  I look forward to the next one! And despite what other people say, good job author! Ill continue supporting you and your other works!",

            "review_text": "The Hero Project: Redemption Season is a text based RPG in which your decisions affect the story.   I have not played the original Hero Project trilogy so this would be my introduction into the world.  Although the basis for the story is very promising and engaging, it more than occasionally suffers from ham-fisted writing that detracts from immersion. You play as a character of chosen gender and sexuality whose physiology mimics an animal and morphs on a daily basis. You use this power to enter the Hero Project on the agreement that, by succeeding, your sister will be healed.   Along the way you are introduced to power based inequality and group targeted hate crimes against those people who have more 'unsavory' powers. The game opens a wide conversation into inequality and the treatment of marginalized groups. However, the story falls into pits of monologues that stray from the focus of the story and seem to try to educate the reader on societal issues.   Overall, this is an enjoyable game if you can overlook the jump in the focus of storytelling every now and then. I feel that the reason this game has mixed reviews is because of this and it's a shame because beneath it is an enjoyable story with interesting and memorable characters.  7/10",

With changing perspectives from your character to one of the side characters to advance the story and add more to the plot if feels so fresh. While the underreppresented power awareness can be a bit overbearing at times for some players- especially newcomers- I myself saw no real issue with it and played it like I normally play a Heroes Rise game. If you've played the other Heroes Rise games and have a save file from hero fall, there'll be a cameo from your first hero a few name drops here and there. FELLOW JURYMANCERS BEWARE THOUGH! THIS IS GONNA HURT!  I can't say it's better than the original trilogy however, still this is a must have for your Choice of Games collection~!",

My biggest issue with this story is that it very much feels like you're only playing half of the game. It ends extremely abruptly and without much resolution. It is perhaps, the longest of the 4 games but that only serves to add to the annoyance when you come to the end and it feels so rushed and incomplete. Obviously we're aiming for another trilogy here.   Also, this may be an unpopular opinion but I feel as though the constant focus on 'gender indentity' takes me out of the story somewhat. Words like 'ze' and 'hir' just served to become more annoying as the game went on.   On the plus side, I very much enjoyed the 'power set' of this new hero, and whilst there are a few typos the game is fairly well written, but let's cut out all of the gender fluid/ gender neutral bs.",

            "review_text": "First of all let me say, that in general I really like the Choice of Game games. I really love interactive novels where the reader forwards the plot by conscious decisions. Also I really like the superhero genre. The preceding trilogy, Hero's Rise, was great.  However THP:RS falls flat. Somehow heroic deeds of superheroes are only second to the social commentary. Social commentary per se are nothing bad. But here it feels artificial and academic. You are being told that people are oppressed several times, but this oppression rarely is ever shown. A dystopian scenario with real oppression like slavery, forced labor, ghettos would have been a wonderful basis for a 'rise to greatness' superhero story, where the hero manages to actually change something.  Instead the 'oppression' is constantly talked about in sermon-like expositions and seems oddly out-of-character and out-of-place.  Ironically for a game that for a good part deals with identification, it is rather hard to identify with the main character. The hero powers are a great idea per se, but the daily changes are so radical, it's as if the MC constantly changes with them. Also, in a game where you want to drive the plot with your decisions how the MC should act, it is very obvious that the MC is often 'nudged' into the 'right way'. If you don't walk that path, it could lead to punishment and a dissatisfying resolution.  All in all, I'm missing the superhero story here, with all the cheese and stereotypes from the superhero genre. Conluding: I really can't recommend this game, as my high hopes after the really good first trilogy were not met.  A similar interactive novel from Choice of Games from the superhero genre which I do recommend is: Community College Hero: Trial by Fire. Check that out instead! ",

In the others I got to make my own conclusions (to a point) and while the others did have a bit of hamfisting when it came to social issues, (my character was a ♥♥♥♥, and often when dealing with arguments concernig lgbt all negitve options are taken away from me) this one ratchets it up to an 11. I do like the idea of being an animal powered, one power reserved for gang members in the previous ones, and makeing the best of an often debilitating situation; But it dosn't let you do that or you, the player, be the hero you want to be. No the major choices and desisions on how to feel are made for you so that you become the author's ideal hero not your own. So no I don't recomend this game, nor am I looking forward to the other games that the author has in the works.",
