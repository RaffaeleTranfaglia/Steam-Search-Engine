Don't expect anything too serious though because it's about... well... Moon Nazis... Anyway I love the game even though it may be 'repetitive' to some or not a big title game like ♥♥♥♥ CoD. I recommend the game if you want a decent action/shooter IN SPACEEEE...! P.S: I do believe that it is a bit expensive, I was able to get it because I randomely got a coupon for it when I created a badge for 90% off. So the total was $4.00. Also I do wish that it had multiplyer because I REALLY want to shoot friends in Walkyries. Or shoot them down with friends.",

            "review_text": "(Steam says I've only played 10 minutes, but I beat the entire campaign in offline mode)  Overall, it's a decent game with a few flaws that mean it's best bought on sale. The biggest flaw by far is the controls. Keyboard and mouse is next to unplayable, no joystick support (although I couldn't test it myself), but an Xbox controller makes it pretty fun. They're also mostly unconfigurable (you can invert the Y-axis, but not remap buttons).   The game's two other main flaws sort of exist in a delicate balance. They don't introduce many new mechanics outside of newer, larger enemies, but at the same time it's short enough (the campaign kept moving, but the ending felt sudden and rushed) that I didn't get tired of it until I was trying to get through the DLC. Same goes for the music. There aren't a lot of tracks, but it's short enough that they didn't repeat enough to be annoying.  There are many ships you can play with (some are forced in missions), but upgrades are stuck in the ship you buy them for, so you'll probably be sticking with one ship for almost the whole time. This is a minor flaw, combined with how the upgrades are purely better numbers. Having upgrades that actually change the ships be purchasable (or just the different ships having a real variety of features) would've made it a lot more fun. The actual designs of ships and stations are pretty nice, just like they were in the movie (the cutscenes are practically out of the movie too).  For a movie game, it's exceptional. Flying was fun, and for the $2.49 I paid, I expected a lot less than I got. I have to give the game credit for its scale, too. When a mission told me there was a 3 mile wide asteroid, I expected it to be just a slightly larger version of the normal ones, but instead they genuinely made me feel tiny next to the thing.    The DLC isn't really worth it. One is a more hectic version of a campaign map where you command the other nation's fleets. It's not bad, but it doesn't give you any indication of progress (I was playing for an hour and no end was in sight, so it might be endless). The other lets you play as one of the enemy ships, tasked with fighting the other side of a battle, where you have to hold out for 20 minutes. They're both nice new gamemodes to have, but even for the tiny price I paid, I'd expect something more. ",

Yes the voice acting is off, and the story is strange, but it looks beautiful.   Some people have said that it controls really badly, but for me the mouse and keyboard controls are brilliant. If you don't take the acting seriously, it is a funny and brilliant game.",

Im an old timer from Wing Commander, Free Lancer, and Tie Fighter days and had elements of them all. It works great with the XBOX 360 controller too :-)",
