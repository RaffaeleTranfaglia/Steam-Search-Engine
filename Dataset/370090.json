I bought this game thinking it was a buy once and thats it but after asking the dev he says it will be yearly (like madden) the stroe paged metioned new graphics and a franchise mode (dont be fooled this wont be till the 2016 version another 20$) the season mode is terrible and basic and there is only to modes that and a quick game. the physics are terrible and graphics mediocre .If this game was a buy once game i would recommend it because of all the great ideas they have but if you want the better features you will have to wait till the 2016 version comes out (another 20$) i am very disapointed.",

They need a little tweaking but its nice to have challenging ai Fast paced gameplay Multiplayer I like the passing system definitely different and fun than other football games. I like the teams names. Thought I saw something about being able to or will eventually be moddable. Definitely want to look more into that.  Not really cons more of suggestions towards the devs  When running with the ball it would be nice to be able juke, spin, dive etc. When recieving the ball I would like to be able to switch views Graphics are older and could do with some work, but I dont really mind im here for the gameplay!  Overall a good experience",

Customization is very nice and is only supposed to get better with updates, if I had to make a request for though it would be one to be able to edit specific player's stats like speed, catching, throwing whatever, also you can change names, numbers, and races, but you cannot change gender, that may seem like a weird complaint because obviously in the NFL and CFL there are no female players but I think it would be pretty cool if they could add that. Overall though this game is worth it, they have two modes currently, quick match and season both are very fun. There is supposed to be much much more to come and already this game is a blast so I recommend it strongly to anybody out there that has always wanted a PC football game that is not looking at spreadsheets and watching the CPU simulate it",

            "review_text": "  Don't buy this game expecting to play a game like Madden on PC. This game isn't nearly as good as Madden was years ago.  However, with that being said, this is  the best  American Football game for PC. Like many others have said, the cons do outway the pros, however the Axis dev team is working harder than probably any dev team that small I have seen. Axis Football 2016 is already out, and based on the screenshots alone you can see a mass improvement in graphics, design, and gameplay. If that wasn't enough, the Axis lead dev already posted the features that will be in Axis Football 2017, and they are the features people have been asking for. Plus, it is fairly easy to get 100% achievements in this game (and it has trading cards as well).  As for the price, $15 isn't very expensive for a game these days, but you aren't just paying for the game. You are paying to support a developer who is working as hard as he can to make a game more worth 15-20 dollars each year. Though I can only see myself getting around 10 hours of playtime in this game, if I hadn't gotten it for free I would have been willing to pay for it. As my rating for the 2015 version of the game, I'd rate it a solid 7/10. It is not a conventionally 'good' game, but it is worth that rating for what it is - the only increasingly good American Football game on PC.",

            "review_text": "Let's get the highlights out of the way: it is awesome to have American football back on the PC. The play-calling is pretty good, there are a ton of formations to choose from on offense and defense, and there is an announcer.  Unfortunately everything else is bad.     Bad animations    Awful blocking AI    Passing the ball on offense is essentially just luck    Defending the pass is essentially just luck    Only 5-minute quarters, with a '1-minute warning' at the end of each half   And that's not even getting into the truly ridiculous, such as spelling nickel defense wrong ('nickle'?) or allowing the kicking team the option of an onside kick, but not allowing the receiving team the option to defend against an onside kick.  Great idea to bring American football back to the PC...but if you're interested in this because you want to play American football and the game is relatively cheap now, don't do it. You'd be better off finding a copy of Madden 08.",

            "review_text": "I hate to leave a negative review but this is not a good game. It could be a decent base game for the ambitious developer to build on, but right now it feels far from a finished product in it's current state.   Passes tend to bounce off receiver's heads. The running game is all or nothing as it seems impossible to break a tackle, could definitely benefit from a spin or juke button. Pretty easy to rack up 20 or more sacks in a 10 min game(quarters cannot be changed from two 5 minute halves.) Player speed seems to be too far apart. I was literally able to run circles around the other team on kick returns like Bo Jackson in Tecmo. Keep in mind I was playing on all-star, did not try hall of fame difficulty.  Now I know this isn't madden but even with really low expectations I was still disappointed. There's a reason madden took several million and years to get where it is. Maybe in a couple years this can become a solid game. Right now it's about as basic a 'football' game as can be. The price has dropped to $15 but imo it's still too high.",

Let's be honest, it's a simple game at this point and I'm in it as a supporter of a project that could be 'the one' to dethrone the monopolistic crapfest one day years from now. It needs a lot of work, and I won't be playing it often until major updates come along.   I love the idea of passing with the mouse, but also would want to do it the old fashioned way as an option. I can decide at the last moment my guy isn't open but the guy all the way across the field is. In that case a simple button press would get it done faster. And of course the qb's stats then determine more about the throw. I'm sure in the present control scheme you can still easily implement qb stats as how far they can throw, and how accurate it is to my requested location, so it might be the best in the end.   Buy it if you want to see where it can go. Until then I still play NFL 2k5 as the best available option, despite trying the other guy every year only to find it hasn't gotten better. We need a competitor, and a particular league license isn't necessary, at least for me. I would gladly be some imaginary team as long as it plays well.",

            "review_text": "Haven't played much of the game yet, but fired it up and started a season with the Steelmen. Played my first game, using my Xbox 360 controller, and almost immediately fell in love with the passing controls (though my first pass awful as I tried to figure out the mechanics). Haven't explored difficulties etc, but if they scale like I would expect, the four options should give each user the chance to find a zone they're comfortable with.  Visually, the is simple. The stadium is filled with thousands of gray and black shirts, the pink endzone is a bit of an eyesore, and the players are simplistic. Not that it really matters. The playcalling interface is similar to something from Madden, and the displays are pretty straightforward.  The audio. Well, I'll give the audio a B for effort. The end result is something that sounds like you asked you neighbor to come over and do. It's okay, but a little distracting at first. However, it's not like you'd expect Grade A sports announcers on an indie title, so I applaud the effort and imagine that the 2016 version will improve greatly. I wonder if there's public domain audio that could be used for the game, like vintage stuff. That could be cool.  One other gripe with the audio is that on four successive plays I heard the announcer talking about a facemask on the play. And it happened way, way more than it would in a regular game, much less one time-condensed. I don't know if it's a scripting thing or whatever, and ultimately it didn't take away from the game, but it sounds liek something that needs to be worked on for the next version.  Haven't used but will the modding of rosters, of course. This is a small thing that adds a lot to a game like this. Hopefully the next version will allow users to mod the team names and logos as well. And basically the more opened up for modding and the Workshop, the better.  Overall, this is a very solid effort, and has the potential for some great things. If you enjoy console football, miss playing football on your PC, or just like playing sports games, you can do a lot worse than Axis Football. Grab a copy and support the effort for better things to come with PC football.",
