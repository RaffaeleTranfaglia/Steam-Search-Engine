            "review_text": "I bought this game because my friend had recently, and he said it was good. 3 dollars was a low price, so I bought it, and didn't expect it to be a good game because of the price. It then sat there for several months, until today, June 20th, 2016, I downloaded it and played it. It was unbelieveably good. It was not what I was expecting at all, I expected a semi-long JRPG with flashy anime characters. What I got was a short, amazing filled story that I immediately fell in love with. The gameplay might be a little bit on the underdeveloped side, but the story beats the hell out of that. I would go into detail explaining the two amazingly crafted main characters, but I don't want to spoil this experience for you. Pick this game up for yourself and give it a play, you won't regret your decision. it only took me about 4 hours to 100% percent it, but it is one of my favorite Steam games I've ever played.",

            "review_text": "LiEat: ~~~~   I guess everybody in their lifetime has managed to tell a couple of lies (or embellish the truth) here and there. Well, imagine you come across “Leo,” a caretaker, and “Efina,” a demon who is a lie detector, nourishing herself by eating lies. You would probably be in a rather awkward position, wouldn’t you say?  LiEat is a rich story /JRPG game where you play “Efina” and her caretaker in three very well written short stories (LiEat I, II and III). Leo is essentially a con artist who is selling information from one town to the next and keeps changing his name and appearance all the time. Efina was born from a dragon egg; she has the appearance a four year-old child but she is only two months old. She call Leo (Hal, Theo, Albert and god knows what) “Papa” (father) due to the fact that he has raised her since she hatched.   In each location they visit, they will be faced with strange events, will investigate them and aim to find all the culprits. You will interact with interesting characters in each of the stories and even have the ability to read their bio’s at the end of each episode. I like that, as it really reinforces the thoughts behind all the characters in their journey.  There is a combat phase, which is not the big aspect of this game; it is easy and provides you with a little bit of respite between the reading stages.   The Pixel graphics lent the game a nostalgic feel, reminding me of playing on my colour Gameboy. Some people may find the low resolution a bit of an issue but all I can say is, do not worry about it. Great price point, only $2.99 for practically three games. No voice over in this game, however the soundtrack is good.   Positives: ~~~~~~~   - Three short and rich stories  - Interesting characters - Nice Pixel graphics - Achievements and trading cards  Negatives: ~~~~~~~~   - Combat phase could have been better  LiEat series are well written and enjoyable to play (mostly reading). Whether you already like this genre or have not yet been introduced to it, I recommend this series.  8/10  Key provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

            "review_text": "Loved every second. The stories were short which is no suprise and battling sucked. but tbh the story was what fulfills the game. From the first LiEat, I wouldnt put down for even a second. the Second one felt kind of lackluster but answered some of the needed answered questions. the Third took my breath away as the trilogy has a brillant end to it which makes me want more. But there shouldnt be, its too good to write a 4th one and potentually ruin the stunning conclusion of the third game.  10/10 would recommend for the 2.99 you put in you get like 5 bucks worth in story.  Personally, i think this supremely better than Undertale. Although i have only completed Normal Route i dont find myself wanting to go back and complete pacfism or genocide runs.  I would definitly go back and play this again cause of how much i enjoyed this story  030 bbbbb",

            "review_text": "The most important thing you should know about LiEat is that IT'S NOT AN RPG. LiEat is a visual novel stuffed in the RPG format.  Combat, gear, HP and SP are purely an accessory to telling a story. They're trivial and pose no difficulty.  This is how you'll spend 95% of your time in the game: -reading through NPC dialogue; -walking from place A to place B to talk to an NPC, or go pick up an item; -walking aimlessly to find place B that will progress the story because no one hinted at what or where it is.  Combat is just padding between the actions above. You'd have to make an effort to die, and you can get out of every encounter by keeping A pressed to basically auto-attack.  I don't have a problem with story driven games. The problem is when they're advertised as something they're not. I think this type of doujin game isn't simply cut for the western market, or at least not for a storefront like Steam... But apparently the other reviews think otherwise.  Anyway, if you can get past the above, the story is run-of-the-mill cute anime; it's nothing special, but it works. It feels like watching one of those random 11-episode anime that you find passable as you're watching them, only to forget them them in a couple of weeks after you're done watching the last episode and being mildly dissatisfied.  The Steam release is made up of 3 shorter games (LiEat 1 to 3) which tell three different stories about the two main characters visiting three different locations and working on as many mysteries/crimes. These all consist in small locations where you run around completing fetch quests, with all the triggers (item hidden in a bookshelf, picture found in a book, note in the trash can...) that don't activate until you've hit a certain story flag, so get ready to search all the trash cans in the area each time you progress with the story.  In short, unless you're a very bored very game-hungry anime fan, avoid this game as it's not worth the time needed to drag yourself through it.",

            "review_text": "This game is cute.  The game is split into 3 seperate games in the same world. It's an rpg about a mysterious con man and his little dragon girl, Efina, who has the ability to eat people's lies. They live in a world inhabited by 'dragons' and they go from town to town solving problems acting as detectives( since Efina is basically a lie detector), all the while the man sells info for cash. Humans and dragons have a rough relationship with eachother. Dragons are sometimes seen as slaves, however they are allowed to be in positions of power and allowed to live among humans. The 'dragons' in this game aren't dragons in the traditional sense. They are still born from eggs and each can breath fire, but they are human in appearance and each is born from wishes. They each have a special ability based off of the nature of the wish.  The characters in this game are likable enough. The con man, who gets several diferent names throughout, is your typical rogue with a heart of gold who still wants to help people but usually at a price. He tells lies, but with good intentions. Efina is a cute, naive, dragon-girl who sees the con man as her father. Her power is to eat lies as mentioned above. She wants to help her father stop lying one day. The side characters are mostly just there for world building and to help Efina understand her powers. There's the police force captain, Captain Neill, who is also a dragon and he is just your generic captain who is stern and helps people. The vice captain, Brett (also a dragon), is a little more angsty and hates humans. Each game has its own set of characters for that game's story obviously.   The art style is consistant and cute. It's pixel art with a chibi look to it and It's styalized in a sort of fancy gothic way. Everything has a dark outline and it's just nice to look at. The two main character get diferent outfits for each story and they fit pretty well with where they are. The music is pleasant and fits with the setting. However, it's not very memorable by itself. There is also a problem with the music and the cutscenes. When a custscene plays the music will often just stay the same or keep playing even as the cutscene is happening. So something might be happening in the cutscene but the music doesn't help portray it very well.  There is also something to be said about the rpg elements. You get the basic stuff (switching items, leveling, looting, etc.), and you fight enemies. But the enemies aren't random encounters, they often just appear as you progress the plot. There are enemies that you can fight over and over however to level up. But there really isn't much need to, as you just get the levels you need during the story anyway. You get rewarded with money from winning battles. But as far as I can tell, there is nothing to use the money on so it's ultimately pointless.  The game isn't very difficult and is more just about the story. There are multiple endings to each game depending on what you do. To get each ending you just have to do one or two things diferently. There is a detective element as mentioned above, where you have to figure out wether lies are actually lies or if they are the truth, but there really isn't a punishment for guessing wrong so you can just guess until you get the right answer. You can also just find items by looking around that can make you completely overpowered to futher drop the difficulty.   The game is also very short. Each story can be beat in just under 2 hours at most. You could probably get a little bit more time out of it to get all the endings and achievments, but you just need to use an old save to do that unless you want to play through it again.  Honestly though it's an alright game for the price. Short and sweet, not to difficult, and just plain cute. It does have flaws just mechanically but nothing that gets in the way. If you have a few hours to spend I'd say give it a try.",

            "review_text": "LiEat is a relatively short JRPG which includes three different chapters, both approximately around 1 hour long (if you're not speeding through the text and really tryin to look into every nook or cranny). If you're a fan of such games as Ib, The Witch's House, Alice Mare then LiEat is probably a game meant for you. Although it isn't quite horror oriented other than for mild body horror, it is a very story-driven game, which focuses on two main characters, a con artist named who goes by many names and a dragon girl named Efina.  There are 30 Steam achievements for this game, most of which can be found on your first playthrough if you're looking everywhere and talking to each character. Such dedication is rewarded with not only more information about our main characters and their history, but also different items, some of which make our heroes nigh impossible to defeat. As it might be evident of my high play time I sought out all achievements and replayed each chapter at least 30 times due to just wanting to explore on my own and uncover secrets without helpful guidances. However, getting the last few achievements proved to be quite difficult, so if you get stuck, be sure to look up vgperson's site, who translated this game, along with many other.  The graphics are adorable and the pixel portraits are very nicely done, so those who enjoy 2D pixelated graphics will definitely enjoy the game. The soundtrack is nice as well, it never seemed to get on my nerves or annoy me after listening to the music for hours upon hours. LiEat knows how to create atmosphere, whether it is to make things silly or horrifyingly dreadful, something which can definitely be experienced throughout the chapters, especially in the last one.   TL:DR;  If we want to go by Funhaus Spoole's view on the worth of games, which is 1 Dollar 1 Hour, aka if you pay one dollar that equals one hour of gameplay, then buying LiEat gives you more than enough content over 3 hours. As you can see I've gotten good 7 hours from this game just trying to complete it and get all of the achievements.  Honestly, the game is just three dollars and if you really enjoy story-driven 2D games, LiEat is definitely for you.",

However, if you are a hardcore gamer who's looking for a lengthy, action-packed anime game that you can invest hours and hours of gameplay into, then this isn't for you.  One thing I noticed is that the story subtly acknowledges real life. It gave me a small taste of human nature and emphasized how lies can consume a person. *Note, this isn't like a Telltale game,* but I feel it's a cool feature in the story regardless.    Pros to LiEat    Beautiful artwork and short animated cutscenes   Creative and lovable characters   Immersive storyline   Cute humor   (You get an achievement for putting panties on your head)     Great soundtrack   Low Price    Cons to LiEat     Short   Monotonous combat   Somewhat lengthy dialogue  Some things to keep in mind --I finished all three parts to the game and found all the achievements in under 5 hours.   (with the help from a guide made by 'Hime~')   And, as you can expect from a 2D RPG, the combat is never that much of a challenge. As I also mentioned in the cons list, the dialogue can take a while.... but it's a   story-based RPG   so I shouldn't really complain about that -especially since the dialogue is well-written.  I recommend LiEat primarily because of its artwork and its storyline.   And you can wear panties and goofy glasses!!   Now I wouldn't say it's an  outstanding  game, but for its price, I'd say it's well worth trying out.  Thank you, game devs! Happy Gaming! ~Xeno  ",

Though it's labeled as RPG, it plays more like a visual novel, laying heavy focus on the story and containing only rudimentary elements of traditional JRPG. It's not hard to find the few hidden items and it's harder to lose the battles than to win them. That being said, the game is still quite enjoyable since it's really relaxing but still gives you the feeling you actually have to do something to progess instead of just clicking and sometimes making a choice like most visual novels.  The story is divided into three arcs each considered their own game, making it a trilogy. While it certainly doesn't deliver the most depth, the lovely characters manage to pull you into their world and make you want to unweave the mysteries and see the solving. There are multiple endings to each arc based on your decisions and the key parts of the story are beautifully illustrated/animated.   Another part about the game that really stuck out to me was the music. Every arc has it's own set of 10 themes and most of them became stuck in my head at first listen. Not only is the soundtrack diverse and catchy, it's also always perfectly fitting the current mood, enhancing the atmosphere in every situation.  Each arc of the LiEat trilogy takes about 1-2 hours depending on how fast you read and how meticulous you search for hidden stuff. While I do wish there was a little more focus on the RPG elements, I enjoyed the game a lot and can only recommend it. 3€ is 1€ per arc, which I think is more than fair.",

There are some emotional moments, especially at the end. I love games...or anything really...that can make you actually feel something. The gameplay is also simplistic, which I don't think is a bad thing. Sure, I like a challenge, but making things too complicated can turn into a bad thing quicker than simplisity can in my opinion. Overall, I loved the game. My only real complaint is how short it is, I didn't defeat it in a single day but I could have if I had had the time to just sit and play it without interruption. Note, my recorded time is not the actual total time I played, I would often get called away in the middle of playing or would be chatting while playing, I had also started playing through for a second time in an attempt to get the rest of the achievements so do not take that as an accurate estimate of time. If I were to give a real estimate, I would say it would take 5 hours at the most, but likely less if you can just sit and play without interruption. I would have loved seeing more, but the content it does have isn't bad for the price so it's not a big complaint.  PROS - Interesting Story - Cute Anime Style Graphics - Good Personality in Characters - Emotional at Times - Simplistic  CONS - Too Short (But, again, it's not a big complaint, the content is decent for the price.)",

The art is cute or disturbing as the narrative demands. The writing is what really sells these games, though. All of the characters are engaging and dynamic, the story of each game drags you in, answers your core questions while still leaving some backstory up to your imagination. I don't have much background in music theory, but I found all of the songs nice to listen to and non-annoying, so there's that. Those who enjoy stories about growing up, healing after traumatic experiences, and found families will most definitely enjoy these games.  If, however, you're super not into anime-esque graphics, or getting very little explanation for your story elements, then this is probably not the game series for you. Also, the battles aren't particularly challenging, so if you're more into game mechanics than story this going to be another no-go for you. Additionally, I didn't think that any of the answers to the mysteries were particularly tough to figure out way before the characters, but that might just be me.  Overall, I heartily recommend the LiEat series for those who favor story over gameplay.",

            "review_text": "I came across this game as somewhat of a 'recommendation'. It looked pretty cute, and it supposedly had a good storyline. So, I picked it up, and I can say I'm quite impressed.  To start off, the game's story revolves around two characters : Efi and Leo. Leo is a man who does nothing but spew lies, and Efi is a young dragon that turns lies into monsters and eats them. Over the course of three chapters, smaller stories involving legends, oddities and supernatural events are laid out in a mostly linear path that prompts the player to interact with objects or NPCs to progress.  The game is strongly story-driven, as the RPG element is fairly lackluster, though the way in which battles are introduced is rather unique and serves the story (the main focus of the game) well. Essentially, Efi is used as a 'lie detector' and must defeat and consume manifested lies as Leo solves a 'mystery' surrounding the abnormal events. Most points of the game are rather cheery and quirky while others tend to be a bit unnerving, though overall the game gives off a light-hearted tone while delivering a tangible plot. Regardless, I thought the story was pretty solid, which is what makes this game what it is.  As far as art and music go, the artstyle is all very cute-sy and pixel-styled, and my only complaint is that during combat some numbers are difficult to read (though it isn't that large of a problem since battles generally exist to progress plot elements and serve as little more than button mashers). The soundtrack is very nice in my opinion; the themes all fit the art very well and while a bit on the simple side, do generally fit the situation.  So there you have it; LiEat: A small story-driven mini-RPG. Came for an RPG, got a Kinetic Visual Novel.",

The story, about a newly hatched dragon that eats lies, is augmented with occassional still images and mini-cutscenes to help further the plot and immersion. The Achievements are also somewhat interactive, a few corresponding to gameplay choices that benefit you, or make you look like a jerk. LiEat is divided into three parts; LiEat I, II, and III. All come with this purchase. Each story builds on the character interaction between the heroine and her caring yet curmudgeonly 'papa.' The other two reoccuring characters that help progress the story and develop the characters are a pair of policemen. And hidden around the game are hints to the final confrontation that occurs in part III.  Besides the short length, one other downside is that the worlds in each part are small, and you will rarely if ever need to go beyond Level 10 for each boss.  Saying any more and I fear I'll start stepping into Spoiler territory, so I'll stop here. Suffice to say, this is a short game but very good and worth the price. if I had to score, I'd give it an overall 8/10.",
