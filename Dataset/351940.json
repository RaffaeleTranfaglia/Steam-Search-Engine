You're left quite puzzled as to what happened at Ark 01 and right now I can't wait to play the next episode to get some of my questions answered. If you enjoyed the story driven telltale games then this one is worth picking up.",

As literally every review says this game is a sexy mashup of fallout, telltale and point and click elements. The graphics and atmosphere are just awesome and the price is right at $3/episode! Although it’s point and click you have to react quickly and make choices that will impact your story progression. (Telltale Shout out)   Sometime in the future the world went to ♥♥♥♥; unlivable for the human race. In a last ditch effort for survival, humanity sealed themselves in Arks… aka underground bunkers or Vaults. (Fallout Shout out.) As time passed Mother Nature began to rectify the damaged world and soon after the vaults opened up… all except Ark 01. Why didn’t this ark function like the rest?   Overall, I’m extremely excited for this game. It comes in 5 episodes which are supposed to all be released throughout 2016. I don’t think they will make this goal since the 2nd episode just recently came out… meaning 3 more episodes in just 5 months. Regardless; definitely worth the money!     Accidently Reviewed",

It's a cheap replica + interesting story + great voice acting - pace is too slow (kind of boring sometimes) - object selecting interface is uncomfortable - puzzles are too simple  It's worth a couple of bucks, without a doubt.",

Unfortunately it´s very short and the puzzles aren´t that challenging, but on the other hand it costs only 3 bucks and the developers will probably listen to the cons and improve them to the next episodes. I am looking forward to the next one!",

The background world is interesting and gives the game's own plot a very good mystery to think about.  Just like Telltale's games, it's not very challenging and the controls can be improved. I experienced minor gameplay bugs, but they have all been fixed long before this review.  This game is very much worth it for it's price.",

I give it a yes because it's not terrible enough to say no.",

When I compare this to what was done in the first episodes of the 'walking dead' and 'the wolf among us', this is lacking. In those I was hooked and couldn't wait to continue the story. In this, I'm not attached to anyone and don't care. It was more about getting through it than the experience. That's not to say the next episode can't turn it around. But right now, sadly I can't recommend the game. From what I experienced so far in episode ONE, it didn't grab me. It was just OK.",

Just click on the only things you can to progress.  I do love story based games, if there are still gameplay mechanics. If it is just clicking through a visual novel, I'm not that interested. With that said, I'm still interested in what the Decendants story turns out to be, and I'll play through all the chapters. But so far, the gameplay isn't engaging.  Pros: Good story and voice acting.  Cons: Camera is garbage.  Convert the camera into an over the shoulder 3rd person view, and this will come off much better.  Add more in-game responses (by the characters) to the state of the Ark as it is found.  You have a giant facility that is in a state of disarry. You could have added a bunch of interesting things to do, and ways to get around. You focused only on the 'Story' instead of on gameplay.",
