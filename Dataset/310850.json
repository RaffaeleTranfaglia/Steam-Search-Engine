If you are like me and the 100's of people then you will be able to play this game maybe 2 or 3 levels and be loving this game when suddenly it will crash. And when you come back to try and play the game it will just keep crashing. The 'developers' haven't fixed this issue and they say to reinstall the game or delete your userdata.dat to fix this issue which doesn't fix it. I would say email them with the exact specs they have since they dont seem to have an issue on their system but other people are annoyed by this. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. Update: Almost month later, I get an email from the maker say will send this on to the developers or just talk to steam about getting money back. That long to say that they are not working on it or just get money back which shows how much they care about their customers. AGAIN DO NOT BUY.",

Very poorly translated, the art style goes from needlessly minimalist to breathtaking (though somewhat cheat-y since it uses a lot of blook and flash) though combat tends to get severely bogged down due to filter cluster♥♥♥♥ing. bosses arent put in at the right times and are thrown at you with little pomp or ceremony, and your victory with even less.",
