            "review_text": "4.7/10 Graphics: 5 Story: - Controls: 4 Gameplay: 5 Soundtrack: - Atmosphere: 5 Genre: RTS   If anyone out there ever played Sid Meier's Gettysburg and loved it then youre in for a treat with this game, as Ultimate General Gettysburg seems to be a clone of one of Sed Meier greatest games.  With that said if you are not familire with Sid Meier's Gettysburg, the game is rudimetery RTS where you pick your side, North or South and are then given a set number of units to command over the three day Battle of Gettysburg. Your actions will determin unit size throughout the battle and eventully determine the entire outcome of the compaign.  Outside the nastagia aspect, the game is pretty average. The graphics aren't 8-bit basic, but they aren't push your GPU to the limits awesome. The creaters seem to really just be shooting for a remake of the original SM's Gettysburg.There is no real story outside of you changing the outcome of the battel with how you play, and the soundtrack is almost nonexistance.However, this was the same with the original SM's Gettysburg so this really does not really detract from the game.  What does however take from the game is its controls. Orders are given by selecting units and draging them to where you would like them just like any RTS. However in Ultimate General Gettysburg, this draws a movement line on the map as you drag it. If you mess up with your initial drag then correcting while still dragging will send your units marching in loopty loops across the battle field while taking enemy fire. The only way to correct this is by selecting the unit again and dragging it again to reissue the command. This is minor aanoyence is magnified when you make this mistake with a whole group of units.  With it's over simplisity and handful of flaws aside, Ultimate General Gettysburg was not a half bad game. Ultimate General Gettysburg may not be one for the Hardcore RTSer, but it is definatly something to be picked up for the casual gammer, or for the those of you wishing to relive your SM's Gettysburg glory days.",

            "review_text": "I am a terrible general !  And for once a game is actually not afraid to show me how terrible i am. The game doesn't hold your hand, there's a short tutorial that mainly explains your keybinds and some commands you can give to your troops. Other than that, you'll have to find your own way. And i'm ok with that, because the game doesn't require you to memorize build orders, or min-max with statistics or whatever you can think of that usually involves RTstrategy.  The way you play is all very straight forward. You have your troops, you have the briefing and you choose your course of action, usually involving either staying on defense or going for an attack. Once on the battlefield it's all up to how good of a strategist you are. You move your regiments in an elegant way, allowing you to make swinging flanking manuevers or try a blitz attacks on the center or create choke points that limits the enemy's movement or whatever crazy idea you can come up with.  Due to the slower pace of the game, your mistakes won't be immediatly noticable. You might be running your regiments into a death trap and you'll only find out 5 mins later, when it's too late to still salvage the situation, or is it? If you're a genius, maybe you can still turn things in your favour (i have yet to find out :p).   In terms of content the game is somewhat limited. You only get to fight gettysburg, but it is split up into multiple battles spanning 3 to 4 days, with a few battles per day. So one campaign usually involves around 10 battles, but it varies. While this is limited, it does have a lot of replayability. Your success or failure on the battlefield will affect the next battles, so not one campaign will have the same outcome. On top of that there are 9 AI settings which can give you a different kind of opponent to fight which in turn can affect the way your campaign goes. And offcourse you can fight with either the Union or the Confederates giving you 2 different campaigns.   Anyway, i think i've typed more than enough already. If you're a strategy fan then this is a must buy. Maybe you will like it, maybe you wont, but at 12€ you can't really go wrong. Even if you don't really like the game, i'm sure as a strategy fan you will appreciate what these developers have created. I eagerly await to see which campaign will be featured in the next ultimate general game.",

            "review_text": "This is probably one of the best historic ACW realtime strategy games out there. Anyone with any interest in the American Civil War will want to have a copy of this and it is well worth the 15 dollars being charged for the game. The games does a very good job balancing historical accuracy with playability and the visual presentation is stunning.  At its core, this is an American Civil War tactics game with the brigade being the primary building block. The battle of Gettysburg is represented as a series of scenarios which represent significant engagements fought by the 2 armies. Each brigade is modeled historically in terms of size and performance based on how they did at Gettysburg historically and their reputation throughout the war. Each scenario sees the player commanding 8-10 brigades on average with accompanying artillery modeled as seperate units that take 30 minutes to an hour to complete.  The primary gameplay is derived from testing the player on executing and making decisions using ACW linear tactics and trying to present to the player an idea of problems that require solving by Division, Corps and Army level commanders during the Battle of Gettysburg. This includes selecting good terrain that affords units good cover and holding elevated positions as well as forming a coherent battle line which is not easily enveloped by flanking manouvers. Learning when to hold reserves, where to hold them and how to attack positions are simulated and the decisions asked of the player reflect reasonably on historical tactics from the time period. Morale management is also a serious consideration as units which are sent in on their own against overwhelming odds will break very quickly and become useless to the player in battle.  The highlights of the game include the saving of unit casualties and position during the campaign as you shift from scenario to scenario. Poor performance and excessive casualties earlier in the battle may come back to haunt the player as a subsequent engagment may have the player using depleted and exhausted brigades in later maps in the scenario. This emphasises the need to preserve troops under player control as asking the player to balance between a potentially more costly victory in the immediate scenario and risk having shattered and demoralized troops in later scenarios.   In between each scenario, the player gets to make a strategic decision as to what the overall battle strategy should be employed which brings the player to the next scenario and map. Completing a well executed campaign while minimizing casualties is very satisfying and there is great replayability in attempting to replicate historic decisions made by executing the battleplan better than your historical counter parts, or by 'what if scenarioes' by selecting different strategies than the one actually taken historically (ie. What if Euwell attacked Cemetary Hill on Day 1 instead of being cautious). An overall order of battle listing at the end of each scenario gives the player easy to understand reports.  Movement and control is both well executed and at times frustrating. Moving units involves a simple system where you draw a movement path for each individual brigade you wish to move. It is intuitive and easy to learn but the some more precise manouvers require you to either be able to visualise exactly how a brigade will form up out of march or require some tinkering to maximize use of cover which is very important to the game.  Flaws in the game range from minor inconviences to omisions that should have been dealt with before release. The most pressing problem is that this game is lacking on a good tutorial. The one presently in the game is rather barebones and doesn't explain key concepts well to brand new players.   Those players with a background with 'battle simulators' whether they be from the aracadish Total War series or the more rigid and historical offerings such as Civil War Generals 2 or the Close Combat series will adapt quickly as will anyone with a solid background in ACW or Napolenoic linear tactics.  For those who are not well versed in historical tactics or are used to Command and Conquer / Starcraft style gameplay will be in for a shock and there have been frequent forum posts by such players not understanding core mechanics. A good tutorial will go a long way to resolving the issue.  Line of sight obstruction is another inconviences as the game does not relay easy to read information and lines of fire can be obstructed by things which are not always obvious. A player set up a position he thinks is advantageous only to find his units do not have line of sight covering areas he expects to be covered as enemy troops come up. Similarly, areas where the thinks he is obscured from line of sight may unexepectedly be open.   Others may find historical inaccuracies jarring though in my opinion as a historic gamer, the developers have made a decent trade off between playability and historic representation. For example there is a vocal player in Early Access that has continually stated that artillery is anachronistically to powerful. I personally have not found it to be so and in most battles the game sims out, artillery casualties are well within line of the 8-10% casualties caused as accepted by most historians.  Overall this is not a perfect product but it is a very enjoyable one and for 15 dollars, its is a steal.",

            "review_text": "First off- I am crap at RTS games. There I said it now everyone knows. But this game - aah! this game has redeemed me. Yes the number of commands is limited but for the less gifted generals like me this is a big plus. Also having troops who know which way to point their guns and who to shoot at without being told every few seconds makes this game a really enjoyable experience. You feel like you are really in command and can move your troops about easily with a few clicks. No vertigo inducing flights back and forth across the battle field to micro manage each unit  Terrain matters especially for artillery but you soon learn how to position your batteries to the best effect and the ability to show elevation on the maps helps a lot.  Maybe its just me but I think the sound effects/design on his game deserves special mention. The overall sounds of battle and the cannon/musket fire in volleys and when poor old Will becomes the target are brilliantly done.  I really recommend this game for amateur generals and judging from other reviews the West Point graduates like it as well",

            "review_text": "Surprisingly good. It takes some time to get used to the flow as the entire battle is made up of multiple engagements over multiple days with different corps (depending on your success in previous engagements). However this leads to a delightful tactical and strategic setting where you won't angrily reload saved games if you happen to lose in an area because you know you'll hit them somewhere else.  The AI is good enough that I haven't seen a need to try multiplayer yet. The developers are also continuing to release balance patches.  Ideal for people who feel the battles in Total War games are dry and simplistic but more serious tactical games are too much of a commitment.",

            "review_text": "1st July, 1863. 9:48 am. Having encountered forward elements of Lee's Confederate Army, my Colonel deployed his skirmishing units to blunt the forward movement of the enemy thus giving the 'Iron Brigade' and the other line units of I Corp time to come up. The enemy countered with a sledgehammer style assault on the weak points in the skirmishing line driving back Devin's and Gamble's units to McPherson Ridge. I ordered my cannon to fall farther back to give them time to set up again. We can hear the pipers of the 'Iron Brigade' and are well aware of their stature on the battlefield. The enemy is surely aware of this as well, and I think they can expect a hot welcome of fire and shot when they arrive. My Colonel has trained his cavalry well but has reservations about the quality of the commanders he has been given. However our Detached infantry units have performed admirably in their mission of delaying the enemy's advance.  10:13 am. Davis' brigade has suffered terribly as they tried to cross the valley floor and the enemy center is considerably weakened. Our line held at McPherson's Ridge only because Pettigrew and Heth's Skirmishers elected to take the comparatively minor Oak Hill. The 'Iron Brigade' has arrived and is busy in the south pushing Brockenbrough back towards the Confederates gun positions. As General Buford seems to have things in hand in the north, especially with the arrival of the remainder of I Corp the General has decided to push the right end of the line north, in an effort to accurately gauge the strength of Pettigrews brigade. Our cavalry has done some very good scouting and we are fairly confident of the locations of the artillery and hope to move on them soon. Orders from the Colonel are to leave our guns on Oak Ridge as a deterrent to Pettigrew and the light forces with him. We should be getting artillery reinforcements at any time now, and several more Brigades.  10:38 The Rebs have regrouped and have forced the light units off McPherson Ridge. The General has pulled all the units back to Oak Ridge, there to wait until Cutler and the others are able to come up. There was bloody and savage fighting by the light units in the valley as they screened the other Brigades repositioning, but they have taken minimal losses and are still a bright beacon of Valour for the rest of the Army. The General plans to visit those men tonight.  11:00 am. Our enemy has nothing more to throw into this fight and we are slowly but surely pushing him back. The Iron Brigade has done the impossible and taken Herr Ridge from the weakened and demoralised Rebs. The damned cannon continue to harass us though as it was deemed more important to take the strong point at Herr Ridge and deny the enemy a vital point of contact with the main body.   11:45 am The fighting has been horrendous at the bridge near Spanglers farm but Baxter and Paul have inflicted a serious bloodletting on the enemies III Corp, driving them back and killing them mercilessly. The 'Iron Brigade'' occupation of Herr Ridge seems to have thrown the enemy into confusion and forced Heth, and Pettigrew to move off Oak Hill, which now has our scouts on it, observing the enemies movements. The General has begun telling his subordinates to push the Rebs hard and give them no respite. If we can trap them in the valley we can inflict awful casualties on them in that dead ground.  Would I recommend this game? HELLZ YA! A good replacement for Meyer's Gettysburg. However, it is not that game, so try to give it a shot on its own merits. There are some things wrong with it. For example. Why on the next phase of the battle does the computer move my units from where they were on the previous map? After I had carefully positoned them for maximum effect. AND in some undesirable locations. The map is hard to get used to but with patience it can be read. I thoroughly enjoyed my first couple of tries. I still like the random General selector button. Haven't used anything else really. Got my @SS handed to me a few times before I got the hang of it. I like that you can save at any time. SAVE OFTEN!!! The controls are easy to use after you get the hang of them, and the tutorial video set up is a great initial learning tool. Nice Work DarthMod and Team. RECOMMENDED for gamers. But gonna downgrade this from a 8.0/10 to a 7.5/10  ++++++++ I would like to commend the Developers for the ongoing community involvement in this game. The latest patch just hit, and I am very excited by some of the changes. I have not played with the new patch but will be doing so shortly. This game is worth every cent I paid for it and I have great hopes for the future of this game and hopefully others of equally high caliber will follow.+++++++++++",

            "review_text": "238 hrs on record playing, mostly single palyer. I followed the developments of this game in greenlight and was as giddy as a school boy when released. Having gone above and beyond a sane persons playing time on Empire and Napoleon T/W (3200hrs) with Darth's MODs i might add i've finally found a new addiction to satisfy my 18/19th century warfare. Being a student of military science and history i find this game pretty through in its portrayal and historical accuracies. The game play is smooth(1 crash on record) along with the controls and at some points it feels like the game plays itself without any direction. The infantry is truly the queen of battle and the homewrecker here. Theres only been a few circumstances where where i've scratched my head and wondered what a brigade was doing after i ordered it to do something else. Now for the hair puller, ARTILLERY. The king of battle, is not the king of battle in this game. True it does have some good times where they kind of act like they know what their doing but for the most part they are completely lost. Ive seen battery's stand there and do nothing while the brigade directly in front of it is getting its butt handed to them by another infantry unit or AI arty unit and then all of a sudden they'll start firing at a target half way across the map! There is no targeting at all, not like the infantry units. I've noticed 50 guns will all of a sudden start shootin at a retreating enemy with 9 men half way across the map while engaged in support role or counter battery fire. The AI's counter battery fire is accurate and can wipe whole batterys in one shoot. For the most part arty units just stand there and do nothing unless i place them up the butt of an infantry unit and of course they immediately start taking rifle fire and begin dwindling away rapidly. And theres no quarentee even then that they'll open fire however they may be brave and instead start advancing through the infantry to set up and get slaughtered wholesale. Infantry will charge them and they may not fire even if loaded. Cannister fire by several arty units or more will stop an infantry attack and will cause significant caulalties but not necessarily in the game and the medium range shrapnel shot/cannister will devastate units while behind good cover. Also long range cannon fire seems quite useless as it does not produce any significant loss in men or condition. I've observed long range fire might kill 1 man in 2 or 3 shoots. Lets see, what else. Oh, if i choose the ammo selection other than auto it usually results in more lollygagging. I think that about covers the artillery but i might be forgetting something. The cavalry units dont really play a big role they can cause some serious havoc if handled properly. Im not really sure what the corps staff are suppose to do other than mark the general area of a corps and get in the way. I know your suppose to be able to move your corps with them but usually it just moves half leaving the rest. Cosidering the fact that they are the brass and suppose to have some kind of aspiring leadership qualities It would be great if we could use them as morale boosters for faltering units or reconditioning units resting. The sharp shooters dont really do much either except retreat rather quickly and they never rack up any decent number of kills. A lot of times they'll get caught between 2 brigades and just get decimated instead of staying on the flanks. Still with all these little quirks i'll continue playing the game and enjoying it immensely. Hopefully some of those arty problems can get sorted out??",

Even though the game only centers around 1 battle, this battle will last for hours as you struggle to attack their lines while defending your own, and capturing strategic positions such as hills. AI aside, the game is quite simple. The graphics aren't amazing, but they do have their charm. The historical detail with actual events (e.g. Pickett's Charge), and where every division and every brigade has the appropriate commanders with little portraits for almost all of them (Most artillery commanders have no portraits) is pretty awesome.   There's a few issues with the order giving system and a bit of a learning curve with how to move troops, as it's not just a select and then right click where you want them to go type of system, but once you learn how to not mess up the unit movements, it runs and plays amazing.

I don't mind it because it seems the AI is aware that the troop is exhausted and moves them out so they can rest but still contribute. However thats not what I wanted, you will not give a dirty damn inch you grey little ♥♥♥♥♥.  The artillery can also be a bit ♥♥♥♥y, sometimes its really difficult despite the elevation map mode to position artillery to fire upon the targets you want. They also don't use the infantry behavior which is where you click on a unit and they move to attack (thats not really a complaint). So artillery is always positioned by hand which can be painstaking because despite that position looking right, it is infact not.  That said, the AI is really good, and the depth to the game is apparent despite its simplicity.

The graphics and sounds are fun. Once everyone starts shooting at eachother it is pretty fun to watch. But I havent had one satisfying ending to any battles...  I'm on the fence whether or not to recommend it because of one thing. The battles are designed to take forever but it gives you a short time limit. I'm talking 15 minutes tops for a lot of battles. By the time each battle starts getting interesting the time ends, and I lose because I have fewer troops than the enemy, which is how the battle started anyway. The rate that casualties are inflicted is not accounted for in the time allowed. It is driving me crazy! Let me kill my enemy!  I have not found a way to get rid of the time limit. If the developers could change this I would recommend it for the price asked. $15 isnt bad though",

There is a short campaign that takes you through the battle at Gettysburg and you may do so by either playing the Union or Federate side, changing history while you're at it.  But the game is NOT tiny when it comes to the amount of fun you can have with it. You can switch up the AI's playstyle and difficulty for every playthrough and you also change your own way of trying to beat it. If you're a RTS player that enjoy the fighting part of the Total War games you will probably enjoy this game as well. It does not have THAT much of depth yet, there are not a ton of different manouvers you can do for each unit but the overall gameplay feels amazing.   Drawing lines over the battlefield to move your units feels and works great. It takes a second to get used to, but as soon as you get the controls in to your head you're gonna focus on putting your units in the best strategic positions and doing brave charges in to the enemy lines.   There are however some issues if you play on a lower difficulty, you can actually be to agressive and push the AI army in to a corner of the map making them unable to move. But then again... there is also a multiplayer mode!   Great game overall. Recommended!    / Nurgleprobe ",

The campaign mode is disappointing. the way victories are calculated needs reworking. as sometimes the choices of next battler are strange. eg i held all my objectives hammered the union in terms of casualties and one of the next battle options was retaking two of the objectives the campaign randomiser seemed to think I had lost. I get the impression it was not a relative high priority. The length of a single campaign is far too short and feels as if it was tagged on at the end. Tactically, in battle, there is no map rotation which feels a bit odd but being an old fart using fixedmap angles came back quickly. When issuing orders i found it often necessary to pause the game. I have only used ballanced game difficulty so far and as he Confederates found the AI not difficult (after a couple of test battles to get used to the game).  It probably would benefit from a basic set of formations hotkeys for corps level deployment.  The tutorial is simple straight forward and tells you all you need to know about the basic commands. I am not sure how effective artillery, which is usually a sign of ballance needing tweeking. The Confederate charge is very effective. quite possibly a little oiverpowered.  It is what it is, a small team project on a relatively small budget. For that reason alone I recommend it. Games are becoming far too samey because the producers are business people not gamers as they were in my youth.  A good first attempt. and I imagine great for the multiplayers out there. ",

The learning curve to this isn't too bad at all, and if you have a basic idea of how the war was waged, then you have a decent grasp on the gameplay. The biggest thing I found a little challenging to learn is the morale mechanic.   In terms of the campaign, I'd (forcing myself to say this bit) have to recommend starting with the Union campaign, due to the number advantages. Until you are more comfortable with dealing with being outnumbered.   Once you've got a good grip on that, buckle down, bayonet up, give the yell and charge like furies into the yankees and end the war for old Virginia.    10/10 would rout the Iron Brigade to capture Seminary Ridge again.",

And it really gives you the impression of being in command of a large, multi-core army, with tens of thousands of troops.   PROs    Solid presentation and 'look and feel' including subtle yet immersive sound effects.    Right level of player input for this size of battle. It's up to you to distribute your forces and decide when to attack, hold and withdraw, but the detail is up to your units. This makes fighting even huge engagements with tens of thousands of soldiers per side manageable and fun. Unlike when playing large TW battles, it doesn’t feel hectic or like you need to be pausing every 5 seconds.    Great intro to the Civil War. I was never particularly interested in this period, but the game inspired me to research Gettysburg, Civil War tactics, etc.   Multi-scenario, dynamic campaign makes the battle feel alive, while maintaining a sense of what’s going on and why on the larger scale.    CONs    High level of abstraction may be a negative for players looking for details.   High level of abstraction means that there’s not much to “do” in the game, other than move forces around. There are no formations, special orders or other timing based commands. Even artillery is typically better off just left on Auto (from my experiments)   UI is very Spartan, which means it’s easy to miss certain details, like accidentally leaving your Brigades on “Run”, or not noticing that a unit is fighting with 0 condition.   One battle only. It’s large, multiday and has lots of scenarios, but it’s still just one battle. I’m not sure how many times I’ll feel like replaying it.    Overall, it’s a fine choice for anyone looking to play some great historicals. ",

My first game I chose to be the CSA. I felt sure I would lose, however following 4 or 5 engagements I managed to achieve a deadlock result which was slightly disappointing as my tactics and execution seemed spot on. I love the way this game looks and feels. Now the pros and cons bit:  Pros: 1. Easy to use and units respond to my commands straight away (also a con but we will come to that in a bit). 2. Cleaver use of terrain to determine line of sight. 3. AI - i played with a balanced Union foe without the AI boost and still found the battle challenging, defiantly some points during the battle where I had to think on my feet to react to a clever flanking move! 4. Atmospheric and sound effects good. 5. Fog Of War well represented especially during night skirmishes. 6. Great value for money. Cons:  1. Would have liked to have zoomed into the action a little more. 2. Ease of use, maybe too easy to execute commands, I think for a more realistic experience the execution of orders should have a delay from issue to execution. I am sure that I would have had a tougher time if this were the case. 3. Would like to have seen the effects of powder smoke play a part in adding to the FOW.  Suggestions: Add some music of the era to play over the action, Battle Hymn of the republic would be great as my troops advanced or if you play as the Union – Yankee Doodle!  Please please introduce more battles or a linked campaign with other battles such as Bull Run or Manassas.   Overall an excellent game, looking forward to playing multiplayer! ",

Although this game is all based around a single battle (meaning the battlefield does not technically change), it is still absolute fun to play!   With astounding historical accuracy - and, for the good, inaccuracy - UG:G takes on a real-time strategy viewpoint of a war and battle that do not get talked about very often. The Civil War was one of the wars in our nation's history that clearly defined the way our country was headed. And for military history enthusiasts like myself, you will find that the Battle of Gettysburg's recreated accuracy is astounding. For those who could not care less about historical accuracy, you will enjoy this title as well. Minute by minute, relive the battle that changed the course of and ultimately defined the Civil War. Play as the Confederacy or the Union and play for historical accuracy and conquer Gettysburg as the Union or rewrite history as the Confederate Army and destroy the Army of the Potomac and decimate their infantry and artillery. There's not much to this game as far as technical opportunities, it is a simple game to play: click a unit, draw a path for them to walk, shift their facing direction, order them to attack, hold, charge, or fallback, or barrage a unit (artillery). The goal is to overpower and outflank your enemy in order to gain control of key sectors of the battlefield. The incredible thing about this game is that, because it is all entirely one battle yet not one single level, the key areas of the batttlefield you posses - not to mention the number of men per unit (loss or gained) at the end of the level - will carry into the subsequent level. This continues until the Battle of Gettysburg ends. And trust me, if you lose the whole battle, it could very well be because of a mistake you made in one of the first levels of the game!   I highly, highly, HIGHLY, recommend this game to anyone who likes miltiary real-time strategy games, and board-game style combat commanding.

It is fun strategising your battle and outwitting the AI, and having played through two Union battles I do confirm that the battle plays out very differently depending on where you are successful and what strategies you adopt. I expect therefore that it has just enough replay value to get me back in a few months for a couple more rounds.

Therefore, I was excited extremely excited to learn about his upcoming game and bought it within the first few days of its' release. That being said, I am not a fanboy and do have gripes about the game. I am sure he did not have a large budget and did the best he could but I still see a lot of room for improvement. PROS -Feels like Sid Meir's Gettysburg -Stunning graphics, they work well for the genre and time, nothing really to complain about -Stunning map design. I could tell alot of work went into the detail and accuracy   CONS -Artillary needs a rework. It is sort of hard to get guns in place and the Line of Sight is broken. They units don't respond very well, if at all sometimes when you choose ammo type, even with enemy within range. Rate of fire is fine though. I know some of this was done to prevent artillary from panzering in games but come on. You could even include limber and unlimber like Sid M. did -Need more details on how morale and cover actually work. Fences and rock walls seem to offer little if no cover. -Too simple gameplay in my opinion, it felt like I was just making battle lines and hooking units around theirs on the flanks. Somehow try to figure out a way to add more depth and emmersion into the game. Play around with making your men volley, fixing bayonets, being able to stretch unit formations into longer lines, something like that.  Final Thoughts The game is worth the money you pay for it and would be fun on a roadtrip using a tablet or laptop. But overall it is shallow gameplay in my opinion for a PC game. I am sorry but I expected a bit more. Some of things I said may be attributed to my 'not understanding the game or being bad at RTS' as some people might think but I have been playing RTS for over 15 years and also renacted, am a history buff (MA in history) and love the Civil War and war games in general having served in the army, and visited many historical battle sites. Get the game if you want but I think updates and add ons will really add to the depth of the game. I hope Darthmod performs his magic like he did for fans of TW. ",

Unit morale (courage) and equipment (condition), combined with health (troop number in a single unit) combine to make individual unit strengths and weaknesses interesting. (As opposed to a single health and damage option.) 2. 3 types of units, infantry, cavalry, &amp; artillery, along with differing ammo types for artillery, combine with (1) to further increase 'simplistic diversity.' 3. Map elevation, cover (in the form of trees and buildings), provide for strategic planning of the individual scenarios (days) of the battle. 4. Different scenarios, outside of the historical ones, are available for both sides of the overall 'battle' depending on how well you do.  Cons: 1. The bottom of the visible map isn't completely viewable. As such, especially when playing as the CSA (Confederacy), the AI Union will run troops 'underneath' my units when they are cornered. 2. The controls take some getting used to, as they are made for touchscreen compatibility vs. 'only mouse/keyboard use.' However, they are quite logical and easy to use once you get the hang of it. 3. Unbalanced multiplayer scenarios, especially when playing the original campaign ones. (As the historical battle was 'unfair' to different sides on different days.)  Overall, the game easily fits my personal rule of 'pay a $1, get an enjoyable hour of play from the game' rule.",

I think Ultimate General blows the old one away in graphics and fluid game play. I like the way you can group units and move them as one. I'm very impressed with the live action, but think the old game was better in the following ways;  1. You could march units in column form and then deploy at a designated spot in a number of ways (wedge, refuse line...)  2. You could manipulate individual units. Say deploy 3 reg and have one as skirmmers watching you flank.  3. You could deploy a whole brigade as skirmishers  4. The calvary was more versitle. Able to move as calvary and then deploy in line.  5. The old units had experiance points which could be added to by where they were in line, location of Division commanders, cover....etc.  6. If a unit was in line they would automaticlly start to fortifiy, All in all its still a great game. I would highly recommend this to anyone into real time combat games. Def worth the price.

The controls are easy learn and the 'drawn path' for troops to march is much easier to use than - for example- Total War's waypoint system. The gameplay is far better than I ever expected. Of course there are some nit-picks though. In my humble opinion the artillery needs some work: It seems to be designed to affect the enemy's unit morale more than anything (which was more the case in the 14th- early/mid 19th centuries.) But artilley of the mid-late 19th century was much more accurate and damaging than it is in this game. Even canister at close range from a battery of 10 or so guns causes very few casualties. But that's a small quirk and it's not a major problem. (I just happen to be a major proponent of the 'Grande Baterie' so not-so-effective artillery breaks my poor little heart.) Speaking of centuries, the graphics are very much Windows 95'esque. But I'd much rather sprites that work well than polygonal characters that are buggy and unresponsive. And other than having to run it in 'Alternative Rendering' mode I have yet to really find any bugs or snags. I run it on Windows 7 64 bit so I have no idea how it would work on Windows 8. But for me it seems to be very stable. I hope they can get more battles soon. Maybe less celebrated ones such as Mobile or maybe Alatoona Pass. Cold Harbor would be nice as well.",

I've grown up playing various games depicting this era of warfare, ranging from old Comadore 64 games, Amiga 500 games, etc etc. Most of which focused purely on body count over tactics used, or went more of a goofy style (IE North and South).  This game has quite a bit of focus on 'good ground', something you hear alot if you watch movies/read books on warfare from this era. While moral/endurance/cover severely effects combat, both ranged and melee... ammo/supply is strangely not an issue.  Battles are in stages, each step is based on a part of each day of the overall engagement. You get to choose initial combat style (For instance if you are doing well on first day as union, you can decide to try to push rebels away vs hunker down), but the AI likes to severely change the flow of combat.  There are 9 different types of computer AI, each having different types of combat styles, as well as a random option to basically give it a completely unexpected battle. The AI feels alive, but makes mistakes much like a player would, something I enjoy greatly.  While I would have loved to see supply/ammo be an issue, the game feels like a nice hybrid between a Total War game and something from the History Channel, making for a fun game.  Iron Brigade, how I love thee.   *New review:* Before the patch I found the confederates quite weak, and while I could win (the AI had it's weaknesses and didn't really push the way it should have) as that side it was obvious which side had the advantage.  But now...  I started up a new match, picked hardest difficulty and ran as the union. I pulled back and consolidated my forces as usual, expecting the good old boys in grey to uselessly charge my lines. But yet... they didn't. I was flanked hard to the north, they took the ridge and put imediate pressure on me. I was both horrified and amazed that suddenly what was an easily predictable opponent now was finding all kinds of holes in my lines. It was able to counter my army's movements, each step I found myself behind it's plans, making me losing the first battle where usually I won hands down.  I applaud the devs for making a FAR stronger AI, almost so that I found myself horribly unable to fight effectively. I took severe losses in that first fight, really pressing upon me what that first day must have felt like to the officers in charge, the utter hopelessness in the fight.  Bravo, sirs/madams, bravo. This is now by far my favorite strategy game.",

In the previous version, you could tweak the AI on its difficulty, but generally the units were fairly well matched, the main determining factor of who won each engagement was terrain and morale.   When I picked the game back up, I noticed that even on the easiest possible AI selection, my troops were decimated by the opposing army. I thought maybe this was a boost to one particular side (I was playing as the Confederates at the time), but when I switched to the Union, I suddenly was being slaughtered by the Confederates! I would possess the high ground with a Brigade of over +1,500 strong and watch as a smaller brigade of 800 in the exposed valley below would massacre over 400 of my men with a single volley. It changed this game from a fun experience into a frustrating beatdown where the AI had the advantage in every single scenario. I went from being able to obliterate the Union on day one in the previous version, to suffering a draw with the AI on the lowest difficulty setting after taking thousands more casualties than they did. The first day should be an easy victory for the Confederates, that was how the battle actually took place after reinforcements arrived.  Why did you break the game, guys? This was so much better before the patch, but now it's made it practically unplayable.",

You control the forces of either the Union or Confederates and must capture and hold key positions on the battlefield. Each battle starts off uneven, but reinforcements to each side periodically enter the map. This means you may start at a disadvantage, having to use guerrilla tactics until reinforcements arrive, and then overwhelm the enemy before they too are reinforced.  It sounds cool, but the mechanics don't actually work in practice. Attack and movement commands never function as expected. Units seem to randomly ignore commands to move or attack. An entire battalion of soldiers can be facing off against an enemy and will suddenly turn and flee despite clearly winning the confrontation. Artillery units will blatantly refuse attack orders and just sit still, doing nothing.  Movement controls are downright atrocious, often resulting in units organizing themselves in a way you did not intend or desire. Anytime you issue a move command, the units run around in circles to change from a combat formation to a marching formation. You cannot tell an entire line of soldiers to fall back and instead much select each troop individually. The list goes on...  The game leaves you with a feeling of overwhelming confusion. Why do my units ignore my commands? Why can't they move in a straight line? What causes morale and condition to go up or down? The answers to these questions and more are never provided!",

Entire charges are useless, as your men die by the hundreds every second, only to look to see that even though they are technically in melee combat, the enemy hasn't taken a single casualty. Entire games go by where even though you flank the enemy, use artillery, and outnumber regiments, they never break and even cause your men to break. If you can find out how to play the game better than me, and have a fun time playing, by all means. Please research the gameplay and possible strategies before you buy this.

On the other hand, some gamers may absolutely love the simplified, basic controls. Personally, I feel they make the game border-line unplayable, but it's just a matter of preference and/or RTS controls you're accustomed to.

When I first picked up this game, I was quite excited. Why? This game is developed by the modder who created Darthmod, who basically perfected Empire: Total War. But even this developer too made the same mistake some total war games suffer. The units do not listen to you and have a mind of their own. This makes the game extremely frustrating and tedious to play.  When will I change this review? When there is more player control. One way to fix this is to maybe add a option to disable AI or unit behavior that constantly causes my troops to do stupid things I did not order them to do. Another thing, more formations because everything is rigid to just huge blocks. Like maybe a column formation that increases movement speed or a rest option to allow more control over morale. I have played many wargames and there is a much better way to calculate morale instead of treating it like a water filter that becomes half-full because of a few shots. This can even be expanded in DLC is if that is needed, but as is this game is frustrating and a chore to play at times.  Final note: This game is great, i've played many games and a variety of wargames set in the civil war. This game is definitely unique and is fantastic to play at any time of the day if you want a casual experience, and as a wargamer I appreciate this type of game because I play many games similar to it. I hope the development team can take some of this points and review them and implements at least some of this changes, if not all of them. Thanks for reading.",

            "review_text": "It's difficult to explain why this game is a fail, because it does so well a lot of the time. The problems are difficult to describe as well, because they are not consistent. Everything seems to be fine, and then it all stops making sense.  For somebody considering making a purchase, I would make these general warnings:  1. Units are not placed properly. In the vast majority of the battles where the campaign manager places the units, you will commonly find brigades belonging to the same division and even corps. spread far apart. This has implications for effectively using your units to work together. If you do take the time to identify the various units and give them movement orders to get together, they will spend that time under fire and be all shot to hell by the time they finally get in proper formation. If you just accept the placement and adjust the lines, they will suffer badly from morale penalties.   2. Artillery simply does not follow orders. Don't even try.  3. The strength of units is wildly inconsistent. Brigades are commanded by generals with a start system where more stars means a generally tougher unit. The problem is the wide disparity between the reliability of the one-star brigades, which most of the Union brigades are. (Most of the CSA brigades are much much stronger.) I've seen two one-star brigades do just fine defending in cover with their corps. commander nearby. I have also seen the entire Union III corps. run from cover when taking fire from two (2!) CSA brigades. They fire one volley and run. In cover, tightly linked, with corps commander nearby. There isn't much more you can do to 'encourage' them. When 4500 guys run from 1500, I really do have to call fail.  IN general, it's just realy mystifying on how to properly command Union troops effectively. (I haven't tried CSA.) Just when you think you have it figured out, they find some mysterious reason to break, run or just plain start walking around.  What makes this even more frustrating is that it isn't like this all the time. Most of the time, things are fine, but when they stop working, they really stop working. And you don't know why. Whatever mystery is embedded in the AI that makes your troops fickle isn't documented, either.  The game was designed by a well-known TW modder. I think we can safely say there is a big difference between modding a working game and designing a working game.  I tried. But this game just doesn't make any damn sense.",

            "review_text": "The good things about the game, which have been pointed out in the positive reviews, I generally agree with. The main bad thing about it is the developers' lack of historical research on Civil War armies and battles. They claim (and have designed the game to reflect) that Union soldiers were better-drilled, better trained, and more effective in ranged combat with the musket than the Confederates. Anyone who's read anything about the battles of Fredericksburg, Chickasaw Bluffs, Spotsylvania, Kennesaw Mountain, and Cold Harbor, among others, can tell you that's untrue. Confederate infantry was absolutely lethal in ranged combat. At Cold Harbor Lee's infantry and artillery shot over 7,000 Federals in about 20 minutes, inflicting a total of 12,500 casualties in the entire battle while losing a scant 1,450 themselves.    The developers completely miss the fact that both armies were composed almost entirely of volunteers and conscripts who had been civilians before the war--thus neither side had a real advantage in training. Proficiency in combat came with experience, and here the Confederates generally had the advantage because instead of raising new regiments to replace losses as the Union did, they fed replacements into existing units so the fresh fish could learn their trade from the veterans in the ranks.   Finally, the developers claim that the Union had more advanced weaponry than the Confederates at the Battle of Gettysburg--supposedly this resulted in their superiority in ranged fire, both with infantry and artillery. Also untrue. A modest amount of reading on their part would have revealed what pretty much any student of the Civil War knows--both sides used pretty much the same weapons (except for the Union's repeating rifles and carbines, which were very small in number). The fact is that at Gettysburg, both Union and Confederate infantry were variously equipped with model 1842 Springfield smoothbore muskets and model 1855 and 1861 Springfield rifled muskets, as well as the British model 1853 Enfield rifled musket (very similar in performance to the Springfield). Artillery was about the same--both sides mainly used a mixture of 12-pounder Napoleon smoothbore cannon, 3-inch Ordnance Rifles, and 10-pounder Parrott Rifles. The Union had a higher percentage of rifled guns, but this didn't prove to be too much of an advantage, as rifled projectliles had a tendency to burrow into the ground without doing much damage--the 12-pounder Napoleon smoothbore was actually better in terms of the damage it could do to infantry formations.  These mistaken premises really hurt the game, as they force the Confederate player to charge in situations where it normally wouldn't have been advisable (and charging in this game is pretty useless for both sides, in my experience--the Confederates don't seem to have the advantage in melee combat that the developers advertise). They also enable the Union player to win simply by forming an intelligent line, placing artillery, and pretty much sitting back and watching the fireworks.  This is a game that wishes it could be Sid Meier's Antietam and Sid Meier's Gettysburg. It could have been if the developers had gone into more depth with unit tactics, put more realism into the game mechanics, and done the necessary historical research. You know there's something fishy when a single AI infantry brigade routs 4 artillery batteries in a frontal assault, uphill, with no support while taking minimal casualties, but when you try it with three brigades in a flank attack you get butchered. There are other similar problems with the mechanics that have already been noted in the reviews.",
