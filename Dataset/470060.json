            "review_text": "a real tribute to the old school shoot'em'up! (shmup)  Control is very good and responsive (i've use an xbox360 controller). You can setup keyboard/resolution on the start screen (its build on unity engine). Graphics, pixel art, call it whatever you want, are great too! lot of memories involve ;)  You will die a lot at the beggining just to understand the mechanism (yeah, space rock will smash you too..), its sometime a real bullet hell but very enjoyable!  3 small request: - a different music (more aggressive) when you enter to the final boss arena (or just a beat speed up/rearrange tune from current track?) - a bigger loading screen (look like a stamp on my monitor) - some forgotten translation (german message when you complete a level?)",

            "review_text": "Psychedelic art style and solid bullet hell gameplay. The levels look beautiful and the enemies are just crazy. The game is pretty short though. My first playthrough took me about two hours. The soundtrack is interesting but some tracks sound a bit uninspired. The bosses look great. It's a pitty they all are pretty much the same except for their bullet patterns and sprites. Is the game worth the full price? I'm not sure. I really would have wanted more levels, more weapons, more everything ... I'm still gonna give it a thumbs up because I really enjoyed playing it!",

            "review_text": "Ship slowdown when you're touching the edge of the screen is an infuriating mechanic. The heavy attack button doesn't override your normal attack so you have to keep letting go of shoot. The music is bad, sounds like some kids first go on a keyboard they got for christmas. Very bland and unremarkable overall. I'm very easily pleased when it comes to shmups, give me baddies to shoot and I'm happy, it takes a lot to get me to thumb down one of my favourite genres. Graphics are nice, it certainly looks the part.",
