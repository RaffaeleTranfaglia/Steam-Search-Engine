The game starts off slow with you wandering through a few empty rooms, but just when you think this might be a super boring game with cutesies popping out of the walls, you spend the next few rooms running for your life.   10/10 - The jump scares are FREAKING REAL!!  I understand that some people might think that going through a 1000 rooms might be boring and difficult, but trust me, IT IS NOT. You will constantly be looking forward to the next save point, you will constantly be waiting for the music to change, you will constanlty look forward (and be terrified of) the creature lurking in the next room that might end your life at literally any moment, AND while your heart is pounding, SOMETHING POPS OUT OF THE EFFING WALL.   You cannot trust any room.  It got to the point that whenever I saw a dark corner in any room, my heart pounded so hard in my chest.   DO SURVIVE THE MINI HEARTATTACKS.",

            "review_text": "Spooky´s House of Jumpscares (I refuse to call it 'Spooky´s Jump Scare Mansion') Is one of the best indie horror games  I´ve ever played.   The game starts pretty innocent, and I thought it would be your typical walking simulator with little 'boo!' internet images to try and scare you along the way. That´s what the developers want you to believe.  I was so wrong.  There´s such a cool variety of worlds, and the monsters are pretty original and differ from each other a lot. Pretty original because, just like the levels, you can clearly appreciate where the inspiration came from.  It only took me about 3 hours to finish the game, but these were some of the best 3 hours I´ve ever spent on an indie horror game like this.  The formula is pretty simple. You´re tasked with the objective of going from room to room, until eventually crossing all 1000 of them. Most of the time, not only in the beginning but during the whole game, you walk through rooms that have nothing of interest. Maybe a chair or a couple paintings, but that´s it. This, accompanied with your creepy music and your ocasional carboard cutout jumpscares, really builds up the tension of wether the next room will be normal or a COMPLETELY different experience. Hell, there´s even little game rooms with arcade games in them, and you also get save points every 50 rooms or more depending on how advanced you are in the game.   I don´t want to describe the monsters or the worlds inside the game, ´cause I want you to experience it all for yourself. Make sure you don´t spoil yourself anything.  I don´t really find the game to be that replayable. In my opinion this game is a one time experience.  To end this review, I really enjoyed this game. I would recommend it to everyone that wants something that´s actually scary, as in 'PARANOID AS HELL, ALWAYS CHECK YOUR BACK' scary. Really the only flaws I can find about the game are the lack of replayability and the duration for it, but overall, I guarantee you a really good time with the game.   Take care, c:  ",

            "review_text": "Spooky's House of Jump Scares tells the story of a nameless protagonist who ends up transcending 1000 rooms in a creepy house to try and escape. There's no big backstory to how we ended up here, and the narrative as a whole is loose with only sprinkled information from notes left behind by people who were here before you, and hints of who Spooky actually is. As you descend further into the house, you get stalked by strange and varied monsters...  The game is a free game, and is completely worth playing, but I'm going to start this review being critical of the game's biggest single glaring flaw; repetition. The idea of getting through 1000 rooms is a goal that is fun on paper, but can be quite tedious in execution. A lot of the rooms have randomized layouts, but only a finite of these layouts exist, so you end up going through the same rooms over and over again, and most of these rooms are empty and are made just to rush through. Which, as a result, makes it so that you end up running through hundreds of rooms with nothing really going on, On occasion you end up finding a note, or in a room with something more interesting, but even these can suffer from repetition. There's an Arcade Machine room you can get, which has 2-3 games to play, but are brief and only expanded with another game once (and a secret towards the end), there's a database room describing the monsters, but it's only updated every few hundred rooms you overcome. There's a room involving going the right path through doors to solve a simple puzzle you'll probably have to do 10-20 times before the game is up. On occasion, you'll start being chased by a monster as you go through these random rooms, but many of the monsters have the same basic strategy to escape from them (with only a few being exceptions), so you end up just running through rooms anyway.  This repetition is a shame, since it is sprinkled with legitimately good content and moments, so much so I would say the game is worth playing just for them. While a lot of the game is randomized, the best part of Spooky's House of Jump Scares is the scripted moments. The game will lock you in a unique location you are free to explore that delves into more narrative, and provides more unique gameplay scenarios, ranging from hiding in closets from a stalker enemy to crawling through a colorful child's area at a fast food restaurant. Without a doubt, these moments are the best part of the game, they present a variety of interesting scenarios (many wearing some obvious inspiration of other horror games on its sleeves), and make for an interesting ride whenever they pop up.  The monsters are varied in design and function. There's something like 13 monsters in the game, and they come with some deliciously gruesome and creepy death scenes should you fall to them. Now, they do all behave differently. There's a monster that can crawl out of holes around the environment to pop-up closer to you, a monster that changes the wall textures to a bloody red to make finding your way out harder, a monster you have to look at or else it'll attack you... But with the exception of a few like the last one, most of them unfortunately are tackled the same way... You just run like hell and dash through doors as fast as you can. The added applications are interesting, but in most cases, do very little to switch-up how you approach tackling them; ie, running away.  Still, I found the game to be enjoyable, a delight sometimes, and I may overstate its repetition. The game is free, and takes about 3-4 hours to complete. There's two different endings, and a number of fun scenarios sprinkled throughout the sort of dull middle randomized room segments. And, yes, the game may make you jump and scare you sometimes. Spooky's House of Jump Scares is a solid free horror game that has some definite highs, but maybe 1000 rooms was a bit much.",

            "review_text": "I've made it past 300. Insta-classic.  This is what I have always wished for a horror game to do. Instead of making everything scary from the get go have the most of the thing be cute and normal for sake of contrast with a scary secret behind everything. Well this is not exactly that, but it's very good and I like it.  I like the simple graphics, I think it adds a cute style to everything and doesn't really take away from the scaryness. (although some really advanced graphics mixed in would be a nice way to scare people)  I like the door cutscene from Resident Evil, it's a nice touch. Maybe some more cute stuff besides just the cardboard cutouts would've been nice.  But some more settings would be really nice! Like button mapping and resolution stuff.  I recommend this to every horror fan who's looking for something a little different. At least a price is not the problem.",

You play as yourself on a quest from a ghost who won't be my girlfriend to explore the entirety of her 1,000 room home that just so happens to be made out of every horror game ever made. That's the entire game. I can't say much without spoiling the story, but the game has deeper lore in the first 250 rooms than that hack George R. R. Martin could fit into 5 books and a popular series on HBO. And like George R. R. Martin, the game is a solid 7.5/10 and sports more cardboard ghost cutouts than you can shake a stick at. Please give it a shot if only to say that you played it before it was popular. Because, like George R. R. Martin, the game is going to get very popular for being so gosh darn cute.

After the first 50-100 rooms or so it becomes clear that the cutesy cardboard jumpscares aren't the only thing plagueing you as you journey through what quickly becomes a monstrous hellscape born out of your own nightmares. The game also nods and pays homage to most genres of horror and even references some popular horror games such as Five Nights at Freddy's and Resident Evil. The game isn't very long but if you're a coward like me then you'll only be able to play it in short, 200 room bursts.

With a whole host of 'specimens' trying to scare/kill you, an adorable antogonist, outstanding sound and an ability to deliver an unnerving experience (not to mention the fact that this game is free) should put ths game way up on the lists of anyone looking for a decent horror game.",

            "review_text": "It's in the name: it's a house of jumpscares. It's cute cardboard cutouts of monsters that pop out once in a while to scare you. It's pretty much like jumping out and saying, ''Boo!'' in white bedsheets.  and it still worked on me  The jumpscares work because of the sudden musical/sound cue when they appear, their abrupt appearance on-screen, and the build up to them. You can go 20 rooms without anything happening, but the fact that something CAN happen is what leads to tension that is ultimately released when a blob pops up on-screen. The rooms play with your mind; incredibly narrow corridors where you KNOW something is coming (but doesn't), a large dark room where you see five candles in the distance, and even the use of grain filters in other rooms. The rooms get more macabre as the game continues and it really builds some eerie atmospheres.  Then there are the creatures that are just as cutely drawn as everything else, but still manage to spook you when they suddenly appear behind you. The music changes and you play run-away as you run through many rooms to escape, perhaps engaging with a jump scare or two on the way. Some of the later creatures have these characteristics that actually tense me the ♥♥♥♥ up when im running from them, like the girl saying 'come here'. Maybe I'm a ♥♥♥♥♥ but I got legit spooked and slightly fearful during some of the chases.  For it's simplicity it's an incredibly effective game. At just over 300 MB it manages to contain over 700 rooms, partially because it reuses rooms. But this manages to come into play in the atmosphere, as you wonder if you've already been in an area before, and the game uses that to further mess with your mind.   With each room being completed in less than three seconds, it becomes an addictive grinding affair as you race to the 50th floor of each area (save point and elevator located there). Each elevator taken leads to a change in scenery and the introduction of new characters. See, each 'area' has notes left by characters (never seen on-screen). They're actually pretty funny, like the character hoping he isn't a side-character leaving notes for, in his own words, ''pointless exposition''. Towards the end he realizes he's expendable because he didn't have an origin story at the beginning. Then there's the guy that went to the house for work.  It's Free to Play, it's a 300 MB download, it's premise is a game that actually scares you while being deceptively cute in its art, and it's addictive due to note-finding, new creatures introduced, and floor grinding for new scenery. Strongly recommended because this game is a lot better than it has ANY right being, given how little it has. Part of it has to be with how arcade-like it feels; real simple to play, real easy to get into, real easy to put down and no convoluted exposition. It's really simple, but that fact that it makes the most of its resources and is free (very important) gives it a recommendation. Its also legitimately spooky as it continues, which is odd given the artstyle.",

The game is not really scary as the jump scares are presente in a 'friendly' way, altough in a few moments it can be a little uncanny. Additionally, the game makes reference to other horror games, which I found to be interesting.  Try the game to see if you like it, it's not big at all. And, once again, the game is very slow paced, but the different scenarios presented in the later parts of the game are very interesting and should make up for the mostly empty rooms.

Spooky's voice acting is well done, the art looks and feels good and when you first start playing it's an intresting event.   Unfortunately what starts off as a fun and intresting game becomes monotonous all too quickly. The game boasts '1000' rooms to explore and while I don't doubt that, it's unfortunate most of these rooms are simply duplicates with a slightly different arrangement or change of furniture. What feels like could be a fun exploratory game at first, quickly becomes an on-rails walking simulator in which you are forced through corridor after corridor.   I feel like there's a story here, or something resembling a story, but the content is so sparsely sprinkled about, I am quickly loosing intrest as I run gauntlet after gauntlet of the same thing over and over again.   I appreciate the quality of the jump scares, when you first start, a few of them are bound to surprise you and unlike other annoying games (I'm looking at you Freddy) it does not result in a speaker destroying scream that wakes up the entire house. The jump scares too, will quickly wear off on you.   The game rooms aren't as decorated as I would have hoped they would be. A few odds and ends are scattered here and there, but there really isn't enough to ever convince you this was ever a house to begin with.   The game could have been a lot better if the amount of rooms was reduced (greatly). It feels as though the amount of rooms you need to run through are simply there to extend the play time and in this case, it isn't a good thing and ruins the game. A short game, with faster appearing monsters, events and story would have been much more desirable over what the game currently is.   Spooky's House of Jump Scares feels more like an experiment by the developers to feel out game design and development. As a matter of fact, I hope they take what they already have and polish it and expand it into a much more playable, fun and desirable product.   In the end, the game is free and the quality of this product is still leagues better then some of the paid games that are currently cluttering up STEAM's market.

I ran and ran threw the rooms. then, while the ghost girl was still behind me, i was in the maze room. i ran until i got in the middle of the maze. then i saw it. the ghost girl floated across the maze, i was lucky i didnt go into a dead end.   graphics: good and cute till you get to room 100-probaly every other room.   Sounds: i like the sounds and the how it makes your paranoia go up because the more rooms you go, the louder and more distorted the music gets.   gameplay: Cute and funny until you get scared by a pumpkin  overall: Really good game you should try it out!

The cardboard cutout jumpscares, while they did get me a couple times, weren't as effective later on. But, they DID serve one good purpose: getting in my way while I was running from a Specimen. Which did help set the tone throughout the game. All in all, this game is great. It changes up the atmosphere, throws new challenges, tricks you, and makes you laugh at how cliche it can get.

The aim of the game is to make it through 1,000 rooms of randomly generated dungeon. While there aren't a huge degree of variations between the different floor patterns, the game rarely feels old due to the random events that occur. These events, while random, generally seem to be perfectly spaced out to lull you back into the false sense of security that the game likes to instill with its cute graphics and protagonist.  While less a 'horror' game and more exactly what it describes on the box - read: a gigantic muddle of high emotion and adrenaline - this one is definitely a must-play for horror aficinados, who will recognize a lot of the lovingly reminiscent sound effects and melodies present from time to time throughout the journey.  Alternatively, it's a great one to put up, sit back, and watch as someone else plays it. Most likely swearing loudly the whole time.",

            "review_text": "SHOJS is definitely a game that is defined by its nickname: it's spooky and FULL of jumpscares. You start off fairly easy, with the jumpscares being very cutesy and the specimens relatively easy to avoid. As you progress, however, and meet more specimens, the scenery gets creepier, the specimens tougher and the story more apparent. Sadly, it also ruins the fear factor, as most of the game's scary aspects are on its ambience and incredible music score.   While many of the specimens are creepy, scary, and draw lots of inspiration from other horror games, creepypastas, etc., after a few hundred floors it becomes a game of 'run from the monster and don't look back'...or at least if you don't defend yourself later like I did xD It really loses that sense of fear and helplessness (except for a select few specimens), and becomes quite predictable. However, at the beginning of the game I was utterly petrified because I definitely didn't know what to expect. Looking back, I definitely don't regret playing, as it was 4+ hours worth of YouTube videos, but it definitely wasn't as scary later on. If anything, it got kind of frustrating with certain specimens...especially if you died multiple times because you weren't sure how to escape them.  All in all, I do recommend Spooky's. The art style, the music, the characters, the sense of the unknown, the game's length and its inspiration from other media of the genre make it a must-play. However, be aware that it becomes somewhat predictable later on, with some suspense still evident. LAG Studios, awesome job!  Also, the edition of DLC is great. I'm just a cheapskate and a scaredy-cat xD  Score: 8/10",

I also have (should say had) a nice headset.   I saw this game after playing a few funny indie games. I was in the mood for something mindless and different. I thought 'this game looks cute. It doesn't look scary. Looks like it would be funny.'   I was wrong.   Went through my first 50 rooms with zero jump scares. That kind of built tension in me. I was like 'oh no they dont mess around.'  My first jumpscare had me out of my seat so fast. It was just a cute little smiling ghost. I was embarassed how scared I was over it. I continued though. I thought to myself that I wouldnt be bothered by that again.  Got to parts where I was being chased by monsters. Dealt with more jumpscares. Was getting pretty far pretty fast. Got through 200 rooms. This game evolves though. The cute goes away.  I got to these classrooms and I got the lights off and sound blasted like I said earlier. I had a flashlight. Thats never a good sign in a game. I walked into the rooms and shined my flashlight. I see shadows of people but no actual people. I got hit by one and it looked like they were creeping in. I turned around and ran and opened the door. Theres a little girl in a white dress covered in blood.  I said ♥♥♥♥ that, exited the game, turned the light on, and now Im going to go watch Spongebob to calm me down. Hopefully it wont be the Hash-Slinging Slasher episode. I want to sleep tonight.",

The monster designs are very nice, and the game although cute, is effective in delivering some scares here and there. Although not scary or difficult, the desire to see what’s after the 1000 room kept me playing all the way to the end.

After beating the game, you will have gone through so many scary things, so many chases, so many deaths, and so many jumpscares, that the experience will not be forgettable.   The goal of the game is to go through 1000 floors of Spooky's house. Each 100 floors adds a new enemy and scary situation that has a unique and terrifying style of gameplay. There are intense chase scenes that last for about 10-30 floors every 100 levels, each enemy having a different effect on the player. Most of the scenarios and chase scenes are pretty scary, and this is coming from someone who has played a bunch of horror games.

Nice gaming experience even though I havent finished the whole game.  Pro: Free Cute Some parts are really scary Things are randomized except certain levels, so playing the second time doesnt make you immune to the jump scares  Con: there are no volume control in game so you have to control it with the windows sound mixer. no resolution control either  Spoilers below: first 15 level: are they gonna jump scare me around that corner, oh my god, no, im safe, another level,  Oh what's that bed gonna do, what's that cupboard gonna do, and another level and another level..... 16-43: meh it is fine, easy game easy life 44 this is the level where i first encounter a jump scare, but remember it's all randomized so it might appear earlier. it's a bit too loud so i set the volume further down. 45- the rest of my play: i was joking when i said there are spoilers not gonna tell you everything",

When I first started it, I thought it had a certain retro Daggerfall-like charm. But after 60+ rooms or hallways, I began to get very bored. People have actually sat there and done this for 1000 rooms?  The rooms are all copy and pasted too. A bed, a dresser, a painting on the wall. Maybe a torch or two. Sometimes the colour of the walls change. Why not just make it 20 rooms and actually put work into them, actual choices and intrigue, instead of copying and pasting 1000 rooms and boring people to death? There's so much filler here. Don't do that!  By definition, a game includes *choices* that the player can make that actually affect the outcome of the game in some real way. There are no choices here. It's just a linear bunch of hallways. Should I choose the left door or right door? It doesn't real matter. You're still going on to the next room.   Eventually monsters come out at you and chase you around, but even then, there are no choices to make. You only have one choice: run away. And still getting killed when you made the only choice you could make is not fun. It's annoying. At least if I made the wrong choice and got killed, I could say, okay. I did something bad. My fault. Not with this game.  I got killed by the first 'boss' around level 64 or so. But honestly, I didn't even care enough to give it another try. I realized that even if I did figure out how to 'run away' properly, it would just be more of the same later. The game failed to make me care what happens next, otherwise I might have tried again.  I guess kids are loving this game because some famous YouTubers played it and pretended to be all horrified just to get more likes on their videos. That's awesome. I hope they have fun. For me, it's not even really a game. I watched a few of the let's plays, so I have a pretty good idea that in the end game, it's just more of the same.  On the other hand, it's free, it's simple, and it's functional. There were no glitches or crashes that I saw. Overall, I guess I'll give it a recommendation. Just because I was bored, doesn't mean other people won't enjoy it.",

However I still recommend this game. Why? Because it's the most enjoyable minimalistic, F2P horror game I've ever played.   It lulls you into a false sense of security and once you're there, the cuteness fades and all sorts of crap comes on screen to give you goosebumps throughout. As you progress deeper into the game, things change up a little and you'll be put against different monsters that have their own uniqueness about them. The audio compliments all of this in a great way. Also there's the pull of the mystery of the 1000th level. All this time I was running, I wanted to get to the end. I wanted to know why this cute ghost girl was luring me deeper and deeper into this mansion while being a giant prick at the same time.

This game isn't really about jumpscares.  I originally got this game because I enjoy horror (despie the fact when I play I basically can't get past the title screen), and I decided to play it. It starts off cute and stuff, and it has a spooky ambience to it. The artwork is beautiful. Then SHTF and I was sprinting through all the rooms.  I haven't even finished this game because I'm too scared to.  Sure, it kinda gets stale, doing the same thing everytime, but it's still a great game. It's free too, so you don't have to worry about wasting money (aside from buying the soundtrack and DLC). There's extra stuff here and there, and don't forget the cat posters! (Hang in there!) I feel like it could have improved on the story of the actual house itself but there's another 'story', or 'stories' within the house.   Just...get this game.

The developers managed to create a delightful atmosphere of hopelessness and despair, filled with lovecraftian horror, in what seems to be Game Maker. You don't understand what's happening, and you don't need to. All you need to do is run randomly until you die miserably (I'm currently at room 300 and can't go through the   ♥♥♥♥ing puppet psycho ghost  ). I particularly love the sick mini-game of spooky at the mall (It's sick and completely unnecessary, just an element to enhance the atmosphere), and the usage of sound is really clever. There's certainly a heavy early Silent Hill influence here (1, 2 and 3). There's really nothing to improve here, the game is perfect, but if I would suggest anything, I'd suggest to expand the rooms also in the vertical axis (Which would lead to a much greater despair). Endless descending stairs, spiral or not, making the player climb something to escape from the coming ghost through an upper door. It would look like you're on an actual **mansion** instead of an endless underground maze of it. The mansion can be endless (And this is fun), but since it's impossible, it would look like it's an otherworldly mansion, something in another dimension. The stairs / different floors would heavily improve the probability of a heart attack from someone.",
