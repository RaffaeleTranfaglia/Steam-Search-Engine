It isn't like Windosill, where there are odd little puzzles; it's always obvious what you should be doing, or if not, just clicking around aimlessly (or in some cases, not clicking) will usually move you to the next 'stage' of the letter you're on. I'm not sure this is worth the full price, but if you catch it on sale, it's a weird and fun little piece of interactive art to have in your library.",
