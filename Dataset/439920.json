            "review_text": "At first glance, it may seem like a terribly simple game without any mechanics, but it actually involves some bit of strategy. Placement of troops play a huge role in defeating the goblin enemies. If a certain arrangement don't work, try another.  The game is pretty passive (a good break from other games since many games require you to react) as you can just start the round and watch the enemy get massacred. Crafting weapons is on a 3x3 grid which is similar to another popular game.  I guess this game is pretty good overall but a better tutorial would help.",

There are about 20 or so heros you can recruit. Each with small sets of troops that can also be built up. You can craft tons of equipment for your heros to use, many with 'sets' that give you a bonus. There are many levels and enemies to fight. With very hard bonus campaigns. There is a feature to reset your progress when you get far and bored, and this unlocks many bonus features and special gear that cant be obtained any other way. Thus making replay value high and enjoyable. You can also position your troops for a bit of strategy. Also the creator and staff is very active. They listen to their players and make constant improvements. So this game has a future for it. Well worth the money.",

There is room for improvement, but the developers are working hard and seem very responsive to input from the community.   Someone definitely needs to make a comprehensive guide, with strategies, recipies, troops, heroes, etc.   Bottom line: for 2$ you could get a hamburger without cheese and a small fries at McDonalds. Or you could buy this game and spend quite a few quality hours enjoying yourself. Definitely worth the money.",

Unfortunately, it should really be labeled as early access. The latest patch just highlights how much more the developers wanted to accomplish, and how far short the product is from finished. Along with the balance and interface issues, I just can't recommend this game. Maybe in a few patches I'll change my mind, but right now I'm too frustrated thinking I bought a finished product only to realize how far from complete the game actually is.",
