Sure you're more fair than a lot of other games, but you're incredibly boring and I spend more time standing still looking out for enemies than actually playing.",

Suprise, rolling and blocking are your friend. Controls and combat are smooth. I give this game an honest 8.5/10. Now if you'll excuse me I have to stop myself from pulling the trigger and try to go another round.",

            "review_text": "First of all, I wouldn't compare it to Dark Souls at all. The only similarity I've found was the 'You died' screen if you, well... died. Other than that, I really enjoyed it. The bosses were refreshing (sometimes a bit too easy), the ares were quite nice and the soundtrack is amazing as well. You can get many different upgrades for your weapon and you'll get even more enchantments after multiple playthroughs. 'Multiple playthroughs? That sounds like a lot of time!' you may think and here is my only downside of this game: It's much too short. Seriously, on my second completed playthrough I already got the 'Speedrunner' achievement, that means I've completed it in under 25 minutes. I got all achievements for this game and I think I played through it somewhere around seven or ten times, but even then I only needed around six hours in total. Granted, after my second playthrough I only killed the necessary bosses and not all of them, but still...  All in all I really enjoyed this game and I can definitely recommend it!",
