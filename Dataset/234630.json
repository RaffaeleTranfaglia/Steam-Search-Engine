Your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ xbox controller will not give you the control required to play this game on it's maximum difficulty.   2) The AI 'smashing into you' And players 'smashing into you' is YOUR fault. Learn what an apex is, and follow it. Learn your racing line and don't act like you own the road. Would you drive like this in a real car with your life and the life of others in your hands? No! Don't do it! They're hitting you because you're bad at racing. This game's physics isn't for casuals. Practice, practice, practice.   Everyone says they want 'the most realistic driving simulation possible'. Slightly Mad gives it to you and the crybabies realize that they actually didn't want that. They want to feel like a racecar driver without realizing it takes actual skill. Go play need for speed.   This is the single most incredible racing experence you can have in VR, if you have a proper racing wheel, and you want something that is a little forgiving and looks fantastic.  It translates to real track time improvements, I feel, as long as you set the game to the hardest, full manual difficulty.   The simulation is not 100% ... but it's damn close. It can be somewhat forgiving when it comes to damage or vehicle on vehicle impacts and so on - but the driving and road physics are top notch. If you don't drive like a lunatic and keep it on the track, the behavior is incredibly close to a real car.  As someone who has raced in road course time attack in a real racecar, this is the closest you're going to ever get without splashing 20k on a racecar and making it your life: or getting a full motion sim rig and going all in on iracing.",

One word to describe this game: Frustrating  Frustrating when you find out this game has a terrible progression system, specially because the same devs did Shift 2 that actually had a great progression system with credits and car tuning and customization. Frustrating when you are in the last lap and something goes wrong because of the game and its bugs. Frustrating that every bad thing that happens to you never feels that it was your fault, other 'simulators' transmit this feeling way better and makes you improve, PCARS just makes your Rage meter go up. Frustrating when you need to research how to make the Force Feedback Wheel feel good tweaking the very complicated and confusing settings in EVERY car because the default FFB is terrible and you can't feel what the car is doing. Frustrating when they broke promises of features and starts ANOTHER crowdfunding caimpaing for PCARS 2 just a few weeks after the PCARS 1 release riddle with bugs. Frustrating to feel that the physics don't improve with new updates. Frustrating when you feel that there is something wrong with how aerodynamics works in this game. And frustrating because there is a 'Game of the Year Edition' now, indication that they probably will drop further improvements to the game.  I put hours and hours into the game hoping for this game to get a proper polish but enough.  Bought into the hype, the hype let me down hard, you gotta give them credits, they know how to do marketing for this mediocre example of self-proclamed 'racing simulator' game which is not.  The only thing that could make this game good is the addition of a progress/customization system like in Shift 2 because besides the graphics, everything else it is just mediocre at best.",

Even more so if they aren't used to sims. Watching them slide all over is hilarious - Looks incredibly pretty and runs pretty well too.  - While it doesn't have mods like Assetto Corsa, the 'polish' and the overall quality is much better than AC.

Bloody hell it's s promising and the racing is so good, but the oculus support is a joke, wheel support is a joke. I'm talking silly things like:   You spent 5 minutes selecting and calibrating your wheel. Save all of your settings, bu then when you leave and start the game over again, all settings are lost.. COME ON!  Oculus is supported, but in extended mode only, no oculus compatible menus, which means just a REALLLY awkward experience startig the race on my PC monitor and then dragging it over to the oculus display, then having to constantly recenter my oculus view (which woops, the key is now unbound becaus eit didnt save your settings!).  Also, once in a race, there is no way to access any graphics options, so when a certain option slows down your rig, or is buggy in the oculus, its a pain staking process of exiting the race, toggling 1 setting, starting a race, then exiting again, etc, etc.. COME ON!  for years in development, it's very disapointing that obvious stuff like this was missed or just not cared about.",

It can feel nice as a racing sim though, and if you have nothing else and miss GT or Forza, it can be an unforgiving - but approachable replacement as long as you're not attached to car customization or selection. What it lacks in outright car selection in the road and touring classes, it makes up for in range of car classes, more like the Pro Race Driver series.  If you like big tracks like the Nordschleife... you better have lots of time because you can't start practice/hot lap with warm tires. So that's a good 15-20 minutes just to do a fair run, assuming your car's in mint condition on lap 2.  I can't recommend it for its serious rough spots and issues, but it can be a fun and gorgeous game if it actually runs for you.",

            "review_text": "I'm reviewing this as a game for the HTC Vive. I bought the game after the last patch which added SteamVR support, and I've not played it as a normal racing game on a monitor.  Initial set-up was painful for me. My advise is to totally unplug the Vive and go through the initial setup of your wheels and pedals on the desktop and make sure they're working. It's also far easier to create a career profile if you can see your keyboard while you're doing it.   Also there continues to be an annoying bug in Steam Big Picture/SteamVR Overlay where wheels and pedals are interfering with the controls making it impossible to interact with Steam. To get this game to work I first start SteamVR, then plug in my wheel, then plug in my pedals then, from the desktop, start Project Cars In VR. Then... everything is peachy.  As for the game itself: To me it's absolutely marvellous. Seriously. Being able to sit in these cars and karts, to have depth perception of the incoming road, to really feel like I'm there... well I'm finding it a LOT easier to drive than I normally do in these sorts of games. The graphics are pretty much as you'd expect from a Vive game: Resolution isn't great, you can't turn everything up to ULTRA FULL AMAZING without killing your system... but that doesn't matter at all. The cars and karts are detailed and the enviroments are breathtaking, especially with all the different weather and lighting conditions. The immersion is there, ultra quality can come later with better GPUs.  There seems to be a great range of tracks, including quite a few I know, some I've never seen before but they've all been great and well modelled so far. Project CARS likes you to do a practice round, then a qualifying round, then the actual race. You can skip these, if you like, but I find that going through all these steps methodically is the best way of learning the tracks and learning the cars.   It tells me I should go into the pits and set a 'pit strategy' but I don't care about any of that. Maybe that stuff is good but it's too nerdy for me. I just want the car to be set up right out of the box and so far I don't really have any complaints about the defaults.   There seems to be a good selection of cars. Nothing on the scale of Gran Turismo and the 'normal road car' selection is sadly lacking but then the game is really about fast cars and racing so it's understandable.   So basically: So far I'm really into this. If you're a Vive owner with a wheel this is absolutely an essential purchase. If you're a Vive owner without a wheel I probably wouldn't recommend it... this game needs a wheel. It really does. Should Vive owners buy a wheel and the game? Well, that's a trickier one. If you've ever owned a wheel in the past and really enjoyed something like Forza or GT on the consoles then this is probably exactly the PC racer you're looking for. My feeling is that if you own a Vive then getting a flight stick and a wheel and enjoying racing sims and elite dangerous is all part of making the most of your stupidly expensive headset so... yeah. Why not?   tl;dr: The best racing sim available for the HTC Vive.",

Project Cars is in mnay ways the driving / racing sim everyone wanted. Easy to pick up and hard to master. But...SMS is not delivering what they promised.  There were too many day 1 bugs...as if no-one quality checked it. Then there are the many bugs that persists to this day...with most updates seemingly happily focused on ramming more DLC down our throats.  One of the most annoying is how cars can just magically disappear from replay saves. And dont get me started on the actual replay system. It is truly horrendous. And for a long time all of these things could be overlooked simply because the actual racing is so damn awesome. But no more...not with it becoming clearer by the day that the developer is more concerned with pumping out DLC and planning a big UPDATE in the form of PC2 than they are with fixing a product people paid large amounts of money for.

            "review_text": "Project Cars is, when all is said and done, a very middle of the road racing game. The physics are okay, the graphics are okay, the sound is on the poor side and the single player experience, despite first impressions, amounts to a very bare bones structure.  Physics - Touted as stunningly realistic with 'best in class tyre model', feel very muted. Even with all assists off it still feels as though all cars have some amount of traction and stability control enabled, the behavior of cars at low speed is weird and in most cars it's impossible to do a burnout as you can in any other simulator.  Visually comma it's mostly just an okay looking game, in certain weather conditions and times of day it can look very impressive but it is not the photo realistic tour de force that it has been made out to be in promotional shots and various shill articles from around the internet. Sound, which in the lead up to release was touted as being one of the game's killer features is actually on the poor side. Engines sound clipped and distorted, which can be a cool effect, but in Project Cars sounds tinny and lacking oomph. Cockpit rattles, backfires and tyre squeal are serviceable but nothing exceptional.  The AI in single-player is slow, even on the hardest difficulty, any competent racer will find that they don't put up much of a fight. They also have difficulty keeping off each other and it's not uncommon to find them all dog piled on top of each other on corners they find a bit tricky.  The games true killer feature is the dynamic weather. Setting the weather to random is great fun and really adds something to the game that the other sims don't have. It's also during rain that the game engine really looks its best with terrific looking pools of water forming on the track and atmospheric lighting, it really makes for an immersive experience.  Most troubling is the games current state in terms of stability and features. The game is supposed to have fully animated pit crews, but as of patch 2.0 this is still not in the game and who knows if it's actually going to be added. You also don't need to look very hard to find the plethora of bugs still present in the game, with cars absorbing into each other, flying into the air and falling through the track. The collision physics are also very odd. Touching another car seems to mute your steering, often causing both cars to just carry on off the track, sort of glued to each other. These issues combined with the announcement of Project Cars 2 along with it's funding campaign leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  Project Cars is not a bad game, but it feels unfinished and even with the polish it needs, I am not confident it could match the single player experience offered by games like Stock Car Extreme and RaceRoom. If you are someone who enjoys weather effects and cares more about immersion rather than the racing, Project Cars will have something to offer. Otherwise, don't bother.",

It’s clear this was the focus of the developers as every 2nd race takes place at dusk for no other reason than to show off the graphics at the expense of the gameplay.  The AI is HORRIBLE. The worst AI I have ever seen. They spend more time off the track than on, and have no clue what to do when your car is near them, they either drive straight into you, or clean off the track to avoid you.  The handling is mixed, between “okay” and “terrible”. I’m a sim racer using a wheel. My first race was in a hot hatch that kept losing the back end somehow every time I lifted off the throttle. I spent ages recalibrating, trying driving aids, but couldn’t solve it. That level of simulation would embarrass Sega Rally. Occasionally you find a car that handles okay and you see what this game could have been.  The racing is flawed. You can massively cut corners and chicanes, overtaking dozens of cars. The annoying team radio guy tells you the stewards will “pull you off” if it happens again. I haven’t been disqualified, penalised, or pulled off by any stewards while playing this game.",

In the end I've come away feeling like this whole 'needing to practice and qualify before a race' thing just isn't for me, and it seems a shame that the game doesn't offer a slightly more streamlined approach to the career mode for players who just want to experience the main events. You can manually skip to the main races, but it hamstrings you, putting you at the back of the grid each time. In the end I just got bored.  Perhaps my view has been skewed by the frustration I've felt spending hours fiddling with graphics settings and drivers, and maybe the smoother experience on offer for nvidia players will genuinely lead to more fun, engaging play sessions. Alas, the experience I've had has not been worth the investment (in money   or  time). I only hope Slightly Mad stop blaming AMD for their QA problems and do a better job next time.",

Slides are quite eaily recoverable. Understeer is more prominent than oversteer, though both are fairly minimal.  Force feedback with a wheel: lacking. Even if you spend hours and hours tuning and tweaking the force feedback (which you WILL), you won't get as immersive an experience as rFactor 2, iRacing or Assetto Corsa. It feels numb, lacking in representative feel relating to what you see on screen, and sterilized. There's also an extremely heavy centering spring that you'll have to spend lots of time tweaking to get where you want, but it still won't be great. This is my biggest dissapointment with the game.  Graphics: These are pleasing, but they aren't as amazing as they're made out to be. On par or slightly ahead of Assetto Corsa is my best description. There's tons out there on the graphics in this game. Tone you hype back a notch or two and that'll get you a relatively good expectation level for the reality of them.  Audio: Nothing particularly stands out. It's sufficient.  Gameplay: The career mode is underwhelming. I enjoy that its all about the racing, but I find it lacking depth via no differences between the teams you sign for and an obfuscated progression between series. IE: There's no real clear goals to achieve in order to attract a team from a particular series you want to progress to. There's some big and obvious flaws there I'm extremely surprised the developers didn't seem to notice. The one thing they get right is track and car selection. It's very diverse and populated. Easily PCars' best attribute.  Other: The UI is annoying. It's pretty but when it comes to using it, there are many places of frustration. For example, only being able to change FFB settings in the main menu options. So you have this thing that takes a ton of initial setup work (yes, even after the updates), and the only way to change the (many many, too many really) settings is through the main menu. Yet, the only way you can test those changes is in game. So the end result is the user spends hours and hours tweaking in the main menu, booting up a session, quitting the session to get to the main menu, changing things in main menu, booting up a session, etc, etc. It's one of the dumbest things in the game without a doubt. Choosing a car skin is similarly annoying as well.  Overall, the game is a struggle. That's the best way to describe it. It has a, on the surface, career type I want. However it doesn't excecute it well. The physics are *ok* but not very good and definitely not up to par wih its competition. The force feedback is a quagmire of disappointment. The visuals are nice but not nearly as pretty as advertised or hyped up to be. And there are a myriad of annoyances throughout the experience from UI design to choosing a car skin. The one and major saving grace for this game is its extensive car and track list. I won't go over the PCars 2 drama and what that may or may not entail. Nor will I go over the development drama of this game. However, as an owner of this game, I really hope Slightly Mad Studios keeps working on this title. It still has potential, but at this point is more of a Beta release than anything.",

One minute it is Ok, the next it is horrendous. One car sticks to the road like it's glued on, and the next, a pure race car is like driving on some kind of super slick polymer. Almost all cars feel utterly disconected from the track. Random sounds thrown in to simulate what, I don't really know. Gave it a go and tried playing career, but when you have rain tires on in the rain and the slightest input of any kind and your car is off the track or into the wall or going backwards. All the while the AI is driving around as if it were on slicks in dry conditions.  Had one point where in the dry I actually had the fastest lap time until the last three seconds of practice when BOOM, an AI driver beat me by a mere twenty six seconds putting me at number two.  What a joke these guys played on the consumer. Next go around they will not get my money. I will give it to Polyphony Digital. Grand Turismo may be a little numb on occasion, and they may still have AI issues next time around, but at least it is not one big, unfinished, riddled with bugs, lie to the consumer. The saddest part about games like this is that the people that make them are utterly shameless about putting out trash.",

You can change everything about the car such as technical details about the tire pressure for each wheel. Personally, I don't have a clue what I am doing with these settings so leave them at stock, but someone with a knowledge of that stuff would definitely benefit from tuning their car to the track conditions.  I am yet to try out the multiplayer as it seems like there isnt really progress to be made there, yet I hear it can be fun in terms of messing around with friends.  Pros: -Stunning graphics -Realistic feel and steering -Highly accurate track replicas -Intelligent AI -Progressive career mode  Cons: -Higher graphics settings can be extremely taxing on hardware -Controlling the car is very difficult until you get the hang of it -Fairly expensive when not in the sale ",

I started with the steam version, and quickly realized my laptop was not powerful enough to handle the awesomeness that is Project Cars. Even with settings low, for some reason i had difficulty getting it to run. Steam was very cool and gave me a refund for this version.  Last month i got a PS4 with Project Cars, and it now runs as it should. The game is amazing, you really have to compensate in the corners and each car feels very unique. I really enjoy the addition of the highway tracks and both of them are very scenic.   Project Cars is for the driving enthuseiest and i would not recommend this for a beginner, although you can play with assists i don't recommend it. I consider myself a moderate driver but i still need a ton of work when it comes to sim racers, it has a nice variable difficulty which you can play around with to suit your tastes. Many cars are quite challenging to drive and get the hang of. Karts are lots of fun.   I have played everything from Gran Turismo to a little iRacing.. keyword a little.

The cars and tracks selection is a little on the down side compared to Gran Turismo 6. But unlike GT6 all of their cars are well detailed inside and out.   The control and car setup settings are a little initmidating if you are new to racing games, but if you are not there are a lot of adjustments you can make to fine tune the controls and gameplay to your liking. I play this game using a logitech DFGT which has 900 degree rotation so the game seemed to think I wanted to turn all those degrees to go around a corner. But after i adjusted the rotation degrees limit to 360 in the logitech profiler (which is not in game) the turning control was a lot better.   The career mode is fun and again you can adjust how you want to play. For example you can start racing GT cars right away or start from the bottom in the go kart league and work your way to the top. In every race you can adjust the AI and the amount of laps you want.  The multiplayer is fun, you have warm up sessions and qualifying before the race. The only problem is expect dirty drivers that will bump you off the road.",

I gave it a 9/10 realsm because there is always room for improvment on tracks, skidding, collitions, etc.  Scored the multiplayer with 9/10, the API is decent and the ability to jump right into a race is semi-easy  The learning curve is based on my own experience.

One negative comment: when doing a timetrail to often your time is cancelled in the lap your driving when going off track. If you,re unlucky, even the next lap. I understand you have to do something against cheating, but this is ridicilus. In older games like GTR2 for instance the game looked at the amount of throttle you were on when off track.  Make it beter Project CARS!!!  But beside that I give this game an 7+   Good job, but get rid of the stupidity!",

Pros:  Excellent sound short load times many (real) tracks that all look totally AMAZING weather and night racing good controller support  Cons:  Not as many cars as I would like (basically a ton of formula and high end racers but not too many road cars, muscle cars, or tuners yet), but each car feels different Can't upgrade cars parts like in Gran Turismo  More info:  Simply put, I don't yet have a wheel so I use a dual shock 3 to play. I have played a lot of Gran Turismo and some Asetta Corsa. This is like a mix betweem both of those games. The damage isn't spot on, but it is pretty darn great. The sound though!!! This game really REALLY impresses me in that department. The sounds are exquisite and make you feel like you're really there. The cameras are awesome and in all, the game runs very smooth and fast, even on my laptop. The main things to focus on here is the amount of tracks, this game has a LOT of tracks (and weather and night time), the sound is AMAZING, but the game needs a few more cars in my opinion. I wouldn't call this one an arcade racer, because it has a LOT of sim elements going on and its pretty darn good. If you need something to brush up your racing skills on, definitely give this a try. I can tell that I will be playing this a LOT in the future. The game is also very fast to load up and put you on the track. This has become my new favorite driving sim/game. I can't recommend this enough to anyone who loves cars and racing sims. After spending HOURS of time driving around on different tracks and getting a feel for this game, I won't be going back to any other racing games or sims anytime soon. Experiencing driving around in a Mitsubishi EVO 8 on Laguna Seca at night and in light rain and with raindrops reflecting everything and headlights lighting up the track, I just can't wait to finish this review and get back into the game!!! I will be getting a wheel setup most definitely, this game is that good!",

The default FFB settings for my wheel (T300) are so feeble that they might as well not be there, and no amount of adjusting the ridiculous number of settings improves this. And yes, I downloaded the `tweaks` files from the forum. Also, despite the description of the game as a simulation, the cars handle more like they do in Grid, rather than Assetto Corsa or RaceRoom; that is, they stick to the road come rain or shine. Until the handling and FFB are patched to make the game more playable with less effort, I recommend passing on PCars and, for less money - and if you can put up with outdated graphics and mostly South American tracks - Stock Car Extreme.",

You can change the actual car grip by mashing throttle and brake inside corner and the car won't slide at any speed, try going smoothly and you are off the track. Some kerbs (those that are on the outer side of a corner) will throw you outside the track, so does grass which is apparently made from glue. Some kerbs however are not a problem for the car and you can cut low speed corners in full speed without punishment. Crests don't work at all. Collisions do not work at all. You go side by side and if you touch you are stuck the the other car until you hit the barrier. On the other hand you can bump into cars in corners without punishment and that looks really funny.   horrible AI - they will keep crashing you on the inside in corners   horrible UI - you can not edit controls from race (only in main menu)   If I find something positive about this game I will update this review.

A case in point is that the F1 cars are more benign in handling tems than the likes of the R500 and the Atom.   The sound is also very bad for some reason and sounds like it's been presented at very very low bit-rates.  If you love arcade racers, then jump in with confidence, but if you're looking for a sim, I'd look at Dirt Rally instead.

The fact that is not perfect doesn't neglect all the good features this sim offers.  The worst: the force feedback, which needs to be tweaked depending on your steering wheel model, etc. to feel good. Once you've done it is more than good enough though.

I tested both and at first I was leaning heavily towards ASSO'. Its customisation and add-on community are levels and leagues above Proj. C.'s. What reason other than greed or laziness that the devs. of Proj. C. hasnt made modding by the community possible I dont know. It would have added so much dept and re-playability. But then again: its certainly easier to sqeeze money out of customers for dlc, if they arent allowed to be creative themselves.  There's one drawback w. a free modding-commnity: driving online becomes a maze where you scramble to fetch the latest community published tracks/cars/what-not's since otherwise you cant take part in the races. Since they'r community build ... you find yourself searching the web high&amp;low for them.   This is the case in Asso' much like it was in GTA, GTA2 &amp; GT-Legends [Simbin Studios] during the last 15years, and in many respects Asso' reminds a lot of these games. Proj. Cars, well, its hard to pinpoint, but it posesses a style and feel of its own.  Wether you choose Asso C. or Proj. C. I think comes much down to taste. There are details which are more 'sim-ish' in one, but then again other features that are more race-accurate in the other. Fx. ffback is definately taken to a higher level in Asso', but on the other hand there's a graphical degree of 'extra' in Proj. C. which just make you feel 'present' on the race track in a way Asso JUST DOESNT DO.  In Asso you may find yourself thinking 'Wow, I'm driving an amazinly detailed sim'. In Proj. Cars - you dont. Your' too occupied beliving that you are actually out on the track and juuust about to crash into the barrier or another car.   -One thing which is an obvious miss and quite a letdown is the monumental absence of Oval Tracks in Proj. C. versus Asso C. who has them curtesy of the commnity.  The Proj. Cars dev. sell Nascar &amp; Stockcar [car] dlc. But... Nope. Not a single track to do the oval racing that these cars are build for in real life. I refuse to belive the developers are ignorant enough to have overlooked this obvios miss. So, once again the Proj. Cars devs. shine with a developed sense for Greed. Which can only disgust a customer.   ... And to get that gargoyl out of the shades: Yep', I'm one of those racers who occationally enjoy 'full contact racing', as its for example done in Stock Car races. It has a thrill and adds a First Person Shooter dimension which cant be described. Obviously one should beforehand ask the fellow drivers if they'r OK with 'high-contact-driving' ... before mayhem let loose on a grand scale ;- )",

            "review_text": "Still the most complete racing simulation currently available.   Now with Vive support, so currently the best racing experience with native support.   VR and Pcars go really well together, I wasn't too sure what differences to expect going from a single screen to VR, but they are huge, which I will try to explain later, but first navigation and play.  The menus and options are all available and selectable while wearing the headset, it uses a look cursor which pulses when you rest your gaze on any menu or option, and on the third pulse the looked at menu or game option is actioned, this works smoothly although not as quicky as selecting using d-pad and your select button on a controller or wheel if you have one.   Pcars centres the display during start up and sometimes I have not sat still through this procedure so I have mapped a button for centering the headset in the controls options, this is not required but can be useful if you change your seating position after starting the game, tho in the VR section it does allow you to set auto recentre when starting a race.   Having selected all the driving options you want and going to the pit or race start the screen places you as usual sitting in the cockpit of your ride, this is where Pcars VR becomes a different experience, rather than looking at a flat representation of the cockpit and the world in front of you, you are sitting IN your car, just feels right and anything else, even triple screens cannot compete in terms of the feeling of being there.   Now all the work that has gone into creating these virtual replicas can be seen and admired very close up, the instrumentation, roll cage, pipes, the windscreen is actually away in front of you and if you are running with rain on then you get to see that the rain is not on your pc screen but just on the cars windscreen or if you are in an open seater then it's on your visor as well as on whatever screen your vehicle has, it just all makes sense, there seems to be so much to take in and this is before the car is in motion.  Once the driving starts from the confines of your cars interior which ranges from the suprisingly claustraphobic of lmp's to the open aired freedoms of open wheelers, you just drive as you would hardly noticing that you can check mirrors look into a curves apex, no matter where you look you see what you would expect to see from your driving seat, the door leading to the landing has gone, replaced by the left hand side of my cars interior with the wing mirror in which I can now clearly see aproaching competitors.   The 3D world around allows for far better judgement of distances for manouvering in the pack,close racing just gets closer and I can now look at them as they draw alongside and stare them down visor to visor as I pass, may be offer a gesture ( or two ), even with AI it becomes more personal.  So the 3d immersive experience that the combination of Vive and Pcars offers is one of the best available for native Vive users at the moment, but there are imperfections as you would expect ( cos life is like that ), first the old screen door, it is there and on objects drawn farther from you the reslotuion seems low because of it, the effect though is soon filtered out by some eye to brain magic during racing, also if you want to race with large grids of over 24 cars in thunderstorms you will need a 980 or better, my 980ti managed up to about 30 on the grid in a storm at night, but above this the start was a little choppy.  I now find it hard to return to Assetto Corsa with it's better feedback or Dirt Rally for the offroad blast ( in fact I haven't since getting the Vive ), as I feel odd sitting in my room and racing rather than sitting in a VR car and racing.",

The issue they had at the time was that they would not back out and wipe you out. However patches were released and I could finally race my seat off. The next feat I love is the sense of speed and this is also twinned with gear changes.

I played the Shift Series, Gran Turismo, Dirt, Assetto Corsa and also tried Race07 and GTR2 lately. But none of those games has ever impressed me as much as Project Cars did. For me it’s simly the best and most realistc driving game I ever played. It’s physics are more complicate than many think, the graphics are amazing and the feeling of really sitting in the car and driving on the track is better than in any other game. Some positive things: • Physics feel right to me • Graphics can be amazing in most situations (even at medium settings) • Great feeling of being a race driver • Many tracks and enough cars • Dynamic weather and time of day nearly without any restrictions (from sunny to thunderstorm in minutes ;-) ) • AI is good (in most situations) as long as you respect them as you would respect a human driver • Many, many options to match your preference  Some negative things: • Some bugs ( but if you follow the official forum you can see that many are already ironed out) • Could be more cars in some classes (but more content is on the way)  In my opinion it’s the best game on the market, and if you are interested in cars and realistic racing you should give it a try!",

            "review_text": "Started out playing Gran Turismo 2 in the late 90's. More recently got a bit serious with GT5 and GT6 and bought a proper wheel/pedal setup.  This game is exactly what I was looking for!  In GT6 i'm mostly interested in racing cars (not road) cars so Project Cars fits the bill here with its racing car roster. In GT6 i'd have to acquire licenses buy slow road cars which wern't as enjoyable to drive (to me anyway) and grind a bit to be able to play the GT3 race cars i really wanted to drive. Project Cars wins again with the ability to choose any car at any time.  With the car list i'd rather have quality over quantity. So while pCars may have a relatively small car list compared to other titles they do seem well chosen as i'll see my self regularly enjoying/using ~50-75% of the cars in pCars while in GT6 i'd only use maybe ~5%. (Admitted, i became a bit of a 'Premium snob' towards the end, not wanting to play 'Standard' cars in GT6) But in pCars ALL the cars are 'Premium' and modeled very well.  Graphics.. cant say much bad about them. They're stunning. DK2 support -- i realize its in progress but i've found myself STILL preferring to use the DK2 even with its shortcomings (menus, less than ideal resolution, comfort). I think i'm slightly faster with the DK2 also, maybe more consistent for sure.  Sounds are great. Again coming from GT6 it wont take much to impress me, but the Z4 GT3 car in pCars sounds incredible. (esp compared to the vacuum cleaner samples from GT6)  Track list is amazing too. I was a lil bummed about no Suzuka, but i have to admit after running around sakitto its an amazing fictional track that loads of fun to drive.  The California highway and Aszure coast point to point courses are amazing as well.  FFB seems very good, although it took a bit of fumbling with some of the settings to get a good feel. There are tons of options of which i have no idea what they do so i expect i'll be able to dial in even better FFB as i get more familiar.  One minor gripe is the lack of explanations in some of the options/settings menus. Some items are obvious, some items are described fairly well, but others have zero description of what the setting is for/does so it'd be nice to have more verbose dialog in these settings screens. Or enhance the 'online-manual' to explain all of these settings. (The online manual is only a very high-level overview of the screens and doesn't go into nearly enough depth in my opinion)  Love the 'Real' assists option which applies assists on the car which are true to life.  Would love to have better photo taking options. The only way i can see is to pause the game mid-race and snap one (or the showroom). We should have the ability to pause a replay and then move into photo mode and move cameras around etc..  Is there any way to save in-game photos out of the 'driver profile'? that would be nice. As it is now I'll probably keep using the F12 steam hotkey.  Seems very well optimized as i just ran 56 gt cars at road america in a thunderstorm and my GTX970 was only dipping to ~45FPS at the start. [Graphics settings all on Ultra/High AA=High]   Highly recommended for and sim racing fan.",

Lots of people on PC hail iRacing as the best you can get on PC, but you have to constantly keep paying to keep playing, so f*** that. The next best thing according to the PC community is Assetto Corsa. Have fun playing with the same 3 cars on the same 2 tracks. Its pitful how they added barely anything since the day I got it in Early Access, and now to get any meaningful content in that game you have to pay. So f*** that game as well. Which basically leaves us with Project CARS.   It has a real campaign mode unlike the other two. It definitely has the best graphics out of the bunch as well. The feel of the game isn't quite up to par, but I think that's more of a force feedback issue rather than physics, although cars in this game tend to get air on crests where they probably shouldn't be leaving the ground. It has a TON of tracks and a very good amount of cars, if anything, it could use more street cars, but overall MUCH, MUCH, MUCH better than Assetto. That alone makes me recommend this over AC, because this game actually has content, this game is made by devs that know what they're doing. The day cycle and weather is also fantastic in this game, better than anything else out there.  My biggest complaint about this game is a BIG one however, the AI ABSOLUTELY SUCKS. It's beyond terrible. Even Assetto Corsa's bad AI is better than this. They stick to the racing line like glue, then make extremely jerky movements to overtake, and will not hesitate to ram you off the road mid corner even when you 100% have the right of way. My other, much leser, cons of this game are again that less-than-stellar feeling behind the wheel, and that you can't change ANY option in-game, you have to back out to the main menu and adjust from there, which gets really annoying when you switch between cars in races and want to set shifting from H-pattern to flappy paddles to match the car.   It's not the end all be all of racing games, but its the best of what's out there. You pay for it once and you actually get content. The other racing giants can't say that.",

First of all,when you crash your car, the damage is a bit akward cause after the crash the car is like a creased tin can with a wheel or two getting off! My point is that the game feels and it is indeed very realistic except the car collision/damage in my opinion. And finally the second one is that it may not support older steering wheels (I have a Thrustmaster Ferrari GT Experience and i had some issues with that,but it might have been my fault i'm not so sure about that.) ,mine is not in the supported steering wheel list,which you can find on the official game site,but it works,with some problems at the beggining but afterall it works and thats fine by me. :P All in all, this is a great game to sink some hours,especially if you like car/racing games!It has beautiful graphics and it feels very real!And it has a plethora of cars and tracks!

Although career mode isn't what I had hoped, it's not bad in the slightest. Put it on 100% difficulty and after 2.0 patch, the AI are ridiculously good and depending on how much practice you put in it will feel like you're racing online. Pre 2.0 patch the AI were slightly too aggressive, but now they're basically perfect, not too aggressive but not too passive.   Online is where it's at though, find yourself a league and you will be loving it. Even in random lobbies you will find people who want to race fairly, although as with every racing game, there are some ♥♥♥♥♥ who hit you off in every corner because they don't get enough attention at home from their goldfish or whatever.

            "review_text": "Project Cars is a modern racing sim-cade with its fair share of ups and downs. While there are a plethora of features that keep the game feeling clean, there are also a numerous amount of bugs that make me want to stop racing - for good. Please understand, before you read this, this review is   not   for the faint of heart.    The Synopsis   I personally would rate Project Cars an 8/10, or more specifically, an 83.5/10. The number is precise, and there is no reason for it to be that precise, so we'll stick with 8/10. After starting up the game and playing for nearly 100 hours, it is quite obvious that the game needs more work. Singleplayer races begin and end smoothly, however, sometimes the AI begin to grow so aggressive that it is like you are on a track with 30 Pastor Maldonados.  After playing some-20 hours on Multiplayer (according to my estimate), it is blatent that the Multiplayer portion is plagued with bugs. At least 1 out of 3 Multiplayer races begin in tragedy, with cars upside down, cars in the stands, and the order all wrong. The bugs are so bad in some situations that it resembles the 1955 Le Mans Disaster. To add on to the horrible starting grid issues, the FPS sometimes fluctuates down to - a horrible - 30FPS in Multiplayer. This is often in correlation with the starting grid bugs. Occasionally the bugs are so bad that the game decides to crash both itself and my car.  So, if you're lazy and need a TL;DR for this section: Singleplayer good, Multiplayer bad. 8/10.    The Good   The car and track selection are small, yet both the cars and tracks are incredibly detailed. Only four tracks are laser scanned, yet every circuit feels as though it is laser scanned - as long as you don't think of the real track while you are racing it. Many, if not all tracks, have random bumps along the turns and straights, giving slight challenge to the driver. This makes races far more interesting for everyone.  Each car feels as though it handles differently from the next, though not every car feels as though it would in real life. Of course, I've never driven one car that is in-game in real life, but neither have any of the other critics in this review section. Moving on. (There is one problem with the Mustang: I am yet to hit a crowd, and that's a problem. Very unrealistic.)  The vast amount of options that you can adjust and change both on-track and off-track are incredible. There are fine tuning options for just about everything. Aerodynamics, braking, steering, alignment, suspension, and beyond for the car, while you can adjust sensitivity, buttons for literally everything, and deadzones for the controller/wheel/keyboard. Sometimes, however, the options are so overwhelming that you feel like Britney Spears during here nervous breakdown stages.    The Bad   There are far too many bugs in Project Cars to outright list. As mentioned prior, the Multiplayer bugs are game-breaking and occur far too often for the races to be entirely enjoyable. The AI in Singleplayer are a**holes. Sometimes the controller freaks out and it forces me to redo all my settings for it. Sometimes the Race Engineer tells me that there are race leaders coming up behind me but I'm in the PIT Lane and we're 5 seconds into qualifying. It's ridiculous, I hate that guy.  I wish he was Australian.  And a she.  That would be much better. I'd probably...ask her out, or something.    The Ugly   ...  Your mom.  *Giggle*      ",

Some have vintage variations, i definetley love that.   +DLC's are worth it, they add a lot of content to the game and are affordable.

This is also why Project Cars is in the ESL. I love the graphics, the realisim, the UI and everything about it. I love Assetto Corsa because it's more of a sandbox and you can change so many things but Proejct Cars was not build for that. They had a different mission and by god they did it right.

Cars do not respond to your position. The AI in this game is comparible to that in Gran Turismo. They stick to the racing line whether you're in the way or slower.  I am a seasoned driver on iRacing and Assetto Corsa and the physics in those games is definitely mroe believable. The handling in Project CARS definitely feels scripted which is something I've heard a lot of people say.  I play with a G27 with no assists and the AI difficulty on 100% and I finish most races (set to 2 laps mostly) with a lead of about 7 seconds (not intending to sound like a ...)  What we need is the career of Project CARS with the physics and FFB of Assetto Corsa and the online/competitivity of iRacing!

I say potential, because there are some serious problems getting in the way of that... but when it's on point, the feeling of managing the car and tyres, battling against the weather, and trying to eke out a few more hundredths of a second are good enough that you start to forget you're playing a game. Even little things like the morning sun obscuring a braking point in an early qualifying session add hugely to the experience.  Mentioning that sun, it's a gorgeous looking game too. The lighting model and weather effects stay just the right side of overblown, so whether it's a sun-bleached day in California or a drizzly, overcast British afternoon on track, you feel - well, there.  But there are clouds over the experience, and not the game's own lovingly rendered storms. The first is that the game is a bit buggy. Not catastrophically so, but every so often it'll hang while loading, or get stuck trying to skip a practice session, with no option other than to kill it via Task Manager. But that's far from the biggest problem.  The biggest problem is the AI. Sometimes, for a few corners, the AI can be some of the most convincing I've seen in a racing game. They race each other, they try to block overtakes, they'll squeeze you off the racing line while stopping short of contact, and they'll defend sensibly going into a corner. They even make some plausibly human mistakes under pressure. But then it'll all fall apart. And when the AI falls apart in Project Cars, it does so in a big way.  I've watched AI cars leave the track and travel hundreds of metres across the grass for the sole purpose of ramming the player. I've sighed as they try kamikaze divebombs up the inside of a corner that can only ever end up in a crash. I've boggled as they leave the track, drive alongside the player car, then turn hard across the track. It makes it impossible to have a satisfyingly close race, because you know sooner or later the computer is going to make a suicidal, stupid move that no real driver would ever consider - the kind of move that will definitely end their race in the hope it will also end the players.  (Although to add to the woes, the AI operate under different physics to the player meaning they often get away scot free with causing spins and crashes)  I'm confident SMS can fix the bugs. I'm not so sure they can fix the AI - and that's a shame, because it's all that stands in the way of Project Cars being the best racing game so far created. Even as it is the game deserves a cautious recommendation, because the racing (providing you keep your distance from the AI cars and accept the need for an occasional restart when they ram you during an overtake) is just that good.",

Customization options with regards to time, weather, lap amount, difficulty are top notch.  The reason I do not recommend this game is the amount of effort it takes to get it to work: - On my first PC the game would not start up at all, simple error message and back to desktop. After two days of trying out different drivers, the game finally launched. ANY GPU drivers newer than 09/2015 would NOT work, so my other games had to suffer in performance.  - My newer PC has the same problem, but this time there are no more legacy drivers that the game will boot with, leaving me unable to play the game.  YMMV, on a friend's PC the game runs just fine, without any issues. Just be warned that the game may not run for you at all, or you'll have to spend a few days trying to fix the issues.",

Now, should you decide to pit the AI, don't bother. You can NOT do it. I was attempting to pit the AI numerous times. There are instances where just when you're about to ram the car, it somehow magically accelerates and moves out of your way and you spin into a wall and lose control. There are times when the AI hits the brakes to avoid you pitting them.  There have been times where I succeeded to knock the AI car out of the track. Guess what, it didn't lose control and remained driving flawlessly and did NOT slow down one bit despite driving over SAND!  You try driving over sand in a race car and it would take you forever to get back on tarmac. Not the AI cars!  This game is supposed to be a 'simulator'. Ha!",

Project Cars is great and well worth a buy if you have been itching for a wide-ranging race sim on PC with some meat to its bones.  The #1 thing most of us want to know is: what does it drive like? Project Cars is definitely a little more forgiving than Assetto Corsa, iRacing, or rFactor, but don't let that fool you into thinking it's 'arcadey.' With the assists off it definitely drives great and all the important parts of handling are there - you'll understeer if you crank the wheel way too far, oversteer if you lift off in a corner, and so on. The part that makes it a little more forgiving is that cars generally have a bit more raw grip in cornering than other sims, but it's still realistic and ultimately a very FUN driving model. For a comparison between something like Assetto Corsa and Forza 5 on Xbox One, I would say it's about halfway in between; and that's not a bad thing, because for those who haven't played, Forza 5 has quite a good handling model.  But the best thing about the game in my eyes is that there's a lot to do and enjoy. Lots of different car classes (not necessarily a huge number of cars, but that's OK) lots of tracks, and a true weather system and day/night cycle. AI is not perfect but I've yet to see a racing game that is. I've seen some people trash the game because of the AI, and I just can't agree with that. AI could use improving but it's still fun to drive with.  I've already done a few MP races and they were easy to get into/setup, lag-free, and overall a good integration of MP.  I can tell my hours will be racking up fast in this game. I can safely say if you like racing games that are about RACING and not just hot lapping or collecting/upgrading cars, you will enjoy this game.",

Project Cars feels like a console game in regards to the graphics and the way cars handle - Unless it's a bug, any car apart from an LMP1 car is impossible to control and is just plain unrealistic. Although it may seem small, the sun rays and lens flare effects when in first person are almost blinding and glitch through decals on the windscreen every few seconds (plenty more bugs like it appeared throughout my 20 minute experience) - I really didn't expect this from a £40 2015 'driving simulator'...If you're not willing to purchase Assetto Corsa however, Project Cars is almost certainly the second best option for you - It is up there when it comes to PC driving games (due to the very low number available), but due to the cost and high anticipation I had for it, I'm incredibly dissapointed - Assetto Corsa is just a better game overall.

For a racing game, it is so god awfully boring to drive or race. Racing is more of a chore than it is fun in this game, especially do to the awful AI that essentially ramps its speed up or down depending on the 0-100 slider. The way that AI is leagues faster in the rain, has incredibly erratic pit schedules, and just overall seems to be driving a different race than you, is frustrating. For those who have played Civ V in great depth, it's reminiscent of how the highest difficulty AI doesn't necessarily outplay you - it just plays a different sets of rules than you.  The physics in the game are good to me, but it falls in this strange area of not exactly sim, but not at all arcadey. I (somewhat controversially) prefer it to Assetto Corsa, which feels like cars on ice skates, but it still isn't 'fun' to drive. Many of the cars are just plain awful to drive, and on top of that, they don't feel fast. It's a strange sensation to be going down the Mulsanne at 180+ mph and not feel any sense of speed. This makes free lapping feel bland and doesn't drive me to try and beat my times. Coupled with few cars/tracks and numerous cars/tracks locked behind DLC, and it's awful.  Online is particularly dead these days unless you get involved with some sort of league, which are still small.   From a technical standpoint, graphics are outstanding, sounds are very good, and setting up controls were fairly simple for me.  In short, it's a pretty game with nothing fun to do inside of it. Racing the AI is boring, being alone is just useless, and there's so much cut content that you'll be paying $50+ to hotlap for 5 minutes and then go play something else.",

Tuning doesn't feel like it represents the changes that should be made. Tire models are ok, but not good. It feels like a bad Forza 1. I take my racing games pretty seriously, (1,600+ hours in Gran Turismo 6, 1,400+ hours in Shift 1 &amp; 2, 150+ in Assetto Corsa, Dirt, and many more)  If you like trying to race but really wish you could constantly be rammed by line following bots who don't react at all then this game is for you. MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED.  If you're considering this game I would wait until a major sale or a free weekend to try it for yourself. I hope we see improvements. Several more hours into the game and if I could get my money back and never play this game again that would be my choice.  Update - 10/7/15. There have been pretty significant changes, and most of them have been positive.  A.I is better but still not perfect, but it's possible to find the right AI difficulty to make it balanced-ish. Cold tiers are still way to dramatic, they're like trying to drive with butter for wheel across a hot pan. I don't really think the road cars are dialed in accurately, so I find myself only enjoying open-wheel and some GT cars. Having a wheel really makes this game come alive, even though it's not nearly as detailed as Assetto Corsa. Therefore, I only recommend this game if you have a wheel.",

            "review_text": "Overall it's a really good game, with amazing graphics (no other racing game comes even close), amazing sounds and models. Car physics works really well too. My only complaints are 1. Bots are incredibly stupid, they ram you at every chance they get and 2. For some reason SMS don't believe in saving your controls (if you switch between wheel and controller like I do you're gonna have a bad time) and saving your hud settings. But overall the game is awesome and most of the DLCs are worth it too!  Update: This game is largely unchanged, same issues still exist. Bots still don't acknowledge your existence, and the problem with the HUD's settings is still there. But they have no problem in putting out more and more DLCs. They give us an Indy car and stock cars but no oval track, yep makes so much sense. And so I will no longer play this game, the visuals and the sounds are polished very well but that's it. I'd much rather play Dirt Rally, a much much more realistic and enjoyable driving experience.",

The problems were fixed BUT a few months ago things got a WHOLE lot better... Virtual Reality!  With the fixes and the addition of VR I figured I'd best come back and re-write my review and say 'Thank you!' to the devs for their hard work.  This game played in VR is fantastic! I have the Oculus Rift CV 1 (also previously had the Oculus Rift DK2) and this game in VR runs totally smooth (though I had to disable one of my Titan X's because VR and/or this game didn't like SLI) and it looks and plays fantastic!  Playing a game on any monitor no matter what size, 3d or surround can't beat VR - it's like you're sitting the in the car and really taking part in the race!   You can watch the drivers feet as he accelerates, brakes and uses the clutch to change gears.   You can watch the dials as you rev/accelerate through the gears.  You can look around the interior of the vehicle you are driving.  You can easily check the mirrors to check for opponents around you.  You can look into the corners perfectly as you maneuver through them.  In short this game + VR is the way it needs to be played!  Highly recommendable and thoroughly enjoyable.",

This game requires a huge amount of PC-performance. Compared to Codemasters F1 it's scripted worse. So make sure that your PC is powerful.  Great simulation, but sadly I encountered Trolls Online. Admins have been fishing at that time, i guess.   ",

That was problem number 1, problem number 2 is the stupid headset cursor (HTC Vive with controllers switched off) that jitters around the screen when you are trying to choose options using a gamepad! I would not recommend this game to anyone, I mean ok the graphics are godd but the sensitivity sucks..big time. My setup is i7 6700K 4Ghz, 32Gb ram, GTX1060 oc, liquid cooled and a Gigabyte Z170X Gaming5 motherboard....oh yes it is VR ready. My opinion is SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY SOMETHING ELSE.  Since the 1st part of this review I now have a steering wheel and pedals and have got the settings good enough to drive and enjoy, hence the change from bad to good.",
