            "review_text": "Don't let Locoland's (originally Steamland) dated graphics deceive you, this classic RTS's gameplay holds up very well for a 12 year old relic only now making its way to Steam. The charming steampunk setting and cute story will entertain you through tough as nails gameplay that is sure to satisfy the most dedicated strategy enthusiast.   Take note that I am generally not one for strategy games, so my opinion may be a bit noobish compared to a genre aficionado. That said, the gameplay consists of classic strategy fair with the added twist of unit movement being relegated to set rail paths. Keeping this mechanic in mind, you must capture and construct buildings, build your force (in this case trains), complete a variety of objectives, and maneuver your trains in and out of on-rail battles against enemy units that are altogether unforgiving. Make no mistake, the game is hard, super hard. Although getting a hang of the controls and hotkeys helps immensely, this isn't a casual title in any sense of the word.  My biggest complaint is a lack of tutorial. I spent a TON of time figuring out how things worked and what exactly I needed to do, but perhaps I've been spoiled by the casualness of newer games, even hardcore titles give more instruction than we receive here. But to its credit, Locoland is from an era when hand holding and player swaddling wasn't a thought in the developer's mind. Learning to play the game was as much of the gameplay as anything else.   Despite my frustrations, Locoland is a very fun strategy game. I only wish we were given more graphical options, perhaps windowed mode, but considering its age I imagine it would be difficult to implement or that it's simply not possible. Either way, strategy fans take heed, you'll want to check this one out. If you often find yourself reminiscing on the gaming days of old, this is your chance to relive a unique and challenging RTS at a very reasonable price.   Bottom Line: Recommended for strategy game enthusiasts looking for something unique and challenging, although a bit dated.

            "review_text": "Locoland is a cute real time arcade action puzzle game from Buka Entertainment. This game is cute, different, innovative and imaginative.  Graphics while cute and visually appealing are restricted to 4:3 perspective with 3 selectable resolutions 640x480, 800x600 and 1024x768. The art work is cartoon like with surreal colours and shading and would be at home in any children's story book.  Game sounds are atmospheric but can be hard on the ears at higher volumes. The music is a variety of sequenced loop samples with arrangements hovering between circus music and new-age or pop. Some of the sound loops clip between loops giving pops or distortion.  The user interface and menu system are usable, but are a little on the rough and ready side. Some text story are grammer bad with spilling orrers (sic).  Game play starts off simple with missions becoming more complex and fast paced as the game progresses. The user gets a factory which can build locomotive engines, Gun carriages, Mortar carriages and Missile carriages. There is also a repair facility where damaged trains can be repaired by driving through. Enemy AI gets similar facilities. The player needs to clear obstacles, navigate complex train track lay-outs and eliminate enemy trains and facilities. While repetitive (like tetris, galaxian, space invaders or pac-man) the game keeps the player hooked with escalating pace and complexity with plenty of challenge and demanding spot decisions under pressure.  Over all Locoland is a fun to play arcade game (with good re-play value) which is family friendly and should appeal to casual and arcade gamers of all ages.  7 / 10",
