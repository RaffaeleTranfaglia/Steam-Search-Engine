This little 55mb gem is brought to you by the creator of '10000000' for an affordable $3(currently on sale).   The object of the game is simple: You must build a boat.  Much like it's predecessor, you journey though a side scrolling dungeon completing tasks and sliding matching tiles for bonuses/items etc.   Excellent time waster if you're looking for something to sort of casually play without putting a lot of thought into overly complicated mechanics.   There's my short and sweet review!  FIN",

What's new in this game? In this game you can move tiles while other ones that you have already matched are still breaking, that is YMBAB is even more fast-paced than his predecessor; however the game is easier, since you have many little tasks, never as difficult as reaching 10.000.000 points.  In the case you are up for more challenge, after beating the game you can start over with the game being harder, but be wary: this is not a new game+, you lose everything! There is also a little gift midrun if you choose to restart... and there are other secrets in the game... (litterally called secrets by it)  There are many little differences that sum up to became an entirely new game (I don't want to spoil everything), so it's reccomended to people that played the first game too.  The only thing I don't like is the start... why am I on a boat and still I have to build a boat? Why are there monsters with me on it and why are they helping me?  Well, we will never know... but this doesn't matter, because the YMBAB is fun. ; )  P.S. How could I have forgotten the music?! The music in this game is great! I'll probably keep playing to hear that.",

Then the end game seems to be an unaided quest through 500 meters? 500 units? 500 steps? 500 SOMETHINGS to finish the one feature of this boat building simulator that you'd find in evoland... I'd spoil it, but its already spoiled...  Also this game lies, you don't build a boat. Last I checked it takes wood, and stone... things you got in 10,000,000 to build a boat... in this game you don't get any wood, or any stone... so how the hell do you build a boat? SERIOUSLY  I'm still trying to figure out how you go from a canoe to a boat... YOU GET NO MATERIALS TO UPGRADE IT... AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH   This game should be You Must Watch Others Build a Boat, then put some cutscenes in... otherwise no way I'd recommend this failure of a boat building simulator.",

You must build a boat is a sequel of sorts to 10,000,000 with the same dungeon crawling, connect x number puzzle game with very bright and addictive game play plus so very much more without spending an extra dime for it. The panick as you can't find a match while trying to defeat the next enemy so you can get that next upgrade or get to that next level of the dungeon is rewarding and tense. It feels Fun.

Its short, only like 6 hours of gameplay with some replayability if you are the kind of person who wants to keep running over and over, harder and harder... But that does not really matter, I loved the characters, loved the concept and the idea of matching three in a row to get your hero through the various locations that the game has to offer, and I loved to see the boat getting bigger and bigger.  I found it to be a very well balanced game, where the quests and the runs you have to do to complete the quests scale nicely with your ability to see the combinations on the board. I enjoyed every minute of the 6 hours I played this, even though I got stuck at some points. The random factors that occur when you replay a level keep it interesting and challenging.  For me, this is the best game I have played all year (so far..) and that for only 3€! I would have happily paid 10€ for this, it is that good.  The music is amazing but limited to two songs and I garantee you they will get stuck in your head and you will find yourself humming the tune in the supermarket when trying to race old ladies to the line at the cash register...

Pros:  -Retains the more complex match-three style of its predecessor, while adding new things such as traps, and new items to use while running the dungeon. -Has a monetary system, which allows for more choices in how you customize your run. -Actually has a tutorial run which explains what things are, and how to go about using them, without being too annoying about it.   Cons:  -Once you've beaten the game, and begin the hard mode, you must go through the tutorial once again. It's not as helpful the second time. -The ship is huge, and the vendors move around each time you upgrade. Finding them can be a little annoying sometimes, especially with a million monster crew members in the way.   Overall, worth the buy if you enjoyed 10,000,000.",
