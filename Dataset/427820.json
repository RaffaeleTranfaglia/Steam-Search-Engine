It took me almost 8 hours to complete the game with all achievements and with zero hints before the last achievement, money well spent. Various rewarding experiences when you finally finish all the objectives when fighting against the trickier levels.  I didn't notice problems or difficulties at all, except that I couldn't get achievements while playing windowed, but that's only a minor thing. If you crave for quality puzzles without feeling like emptying your wallet drastically, buy HItman GO immediately. For a Hitman fan this is also something to consider, even if you're like me who often lacks patience for even mildly harder puzzles.",

The gameplay is straight forward but each mission gets a little bigger and slightly more complex as it goes on so I can't call it too easy. The only real negative point is that dragging the mouse to move is a little weird but apparently more control schemes are going to be added in a future update according to a dev on the forums here.",

            "review_text": "This was my third time buying Hitman GO, and it still impressed me. Enough to 100% it again. An excellently crafted puzzle game that does a surprisingly great job of also capturing many of the core elements of the Hitman games. And that's on top of the beautiful boardgame/diorama esthetic that is perfect throughout. The levels do a great job of providing a steady but fair difficulty curve, with the later levels in each box, and even more so the final levels of the game, providing a very hearty challenge, with the goal of completing all the optional objectives being especially mind-bending at times. There are a few levels or objectives that can feel a bit like duds when compared to the vast majority of the levels in the game that are great, and the camera/controls can be a bit of a pain in some levels (even with the alternate camera angles). It is also worth noting that I played entirely with a controller, and the game controls very well with one.  All in all, Hitman GO is a puzzle game that has very simple mechanics at its core, with many layers of complexity steadily piled on throughout to keep those core mechanics feeling fun, with all that wrapped up in an awesome aesthetic. And that's exactly what I want from a great puzzle game. I'm looking forward to one day being able to buy Lara Croft GO again on Steam, as well as Deus Ex GO.",

You can move your view around but it goes back to the center automatically when you let go... - No way of adjusting much of the audio/graphical settings at all - Not possible to remap keys - Should have included a level editor really  = A decent game well worth the price which will give you something to do before the next Hitman.",

            "review_text": "Hitman GO snuck onto PC and threw me off. I had heard of the game, but never actually considered playing it. After watching the trailer and looking at screenshots I had to give it a shot.  Here's the rundown: Hitman GO basically acts as a virtual board game (I have no idea if it is real but whatevs) You play as Agent 47 and you must strategize to reach the exit of each level without getting spotted. If you're spotted, you start from the beginning. The game is real fun and at some points, it's nerve-rackingly difficult.  Once you beat said difficult level, you will feel like you accomplished something or say 'man, how did I not figure that out?!' It's one of the most puzzling games I've played but it's so damn good. It has a lot of content for a game that's only $6.39. I'd advise anyone to get it while it's that cheap because it's a very nice game. I personally love it and can't stop playing it.  I rate it 8.5/10",

It's the first game in a looooong time that made me feel compelled to hunt down all of the achievements. Clocking in at about 8 hours worth of gameplay, I definitely feel like I got my 8 dollars worth of enjoyment. Some people may want to hold off for a sale, however. Anyone who rags on this game's control scheme for making you click and drag your Hitman around the board is clearly missing the point on what the developers were trying to accomplish with the stylization of this game.  I definitely recommend this game if you're a fan of puzzle games, even if you're like me, and have yet to play another other game in the Hitman franchise.",

It's a fun turn-based strategy/puzzle game with a nice tabletopish graphics design and really chill music.  When I saw it was on sale for 2 bucks on Steam I jumped on it only to be disappointed by the lack luster port.  On the Steam version achievements seem hit or miss if they want to work or not. Not a big deal, but silly. The Windows Store version also lets you use the arrow keys to move. I guess that feature was too complicated for the Steam version, or something.  The Steam version does have some improvements. It costs two dollars more but you get a microtransactionless version and the visual are cleaner (anti-aliasing).   Overall, the game is great and I'd highly recommend it even for the full 7.99 USD, despite it being a strange PC to PC port.",
