            "review_text": "I gave this game a fair try. I wanted to like it and I did for a bit, that is until the lack of UI polish and bugs began jumping out at me more and more the longer I played. The worst being the lag from the bee hive bug which basically makes the game unplayable. The load screen is also desperately long. like several minutes long, even on a high end gaming machine. I think its a simple and fun light hearted game, or it would be if it worked. However I cannot recomend this game in this state. I hope they fix it, when they learn how to code better.",

The world is bizarrely rich with character and creativity. An absurd amount of thought was put into this game and if you spend an hour, it just might grip you.  Unfortunately, it's not great under the hood. Missing character sprites, broken quests that required starting a new game to fix, poor introduction and steep learning curve, a lack of some basic features such as quest navigation, spelling mistakes and the occasional CTD.  It wasn't the kindest experience, but it was actually interesting to me for far longer than I expected.",
