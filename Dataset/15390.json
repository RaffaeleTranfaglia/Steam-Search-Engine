            "review_text": "It's a good game - a strong example of a squad-based shooter. You control the position and focus of 1-3 fireteams, edging your way through battlefields to flank enemies and progress through linear levels. It encourages you to leverage your fireteams because your own weapons are unreliable to the extreme - on par with Counter-strike accuracy. Bullets spray for no particular reason, shots that are dead-on don't always register, and enemies take many shots to take down. While that's frustrating, it highlights that you are not a pure badass. Sure you may mow down hundreds of enemies in a playthrough, but ultimately it tries to knock you down to size with it's iffy gun mechanics - you need to use your squad to succeed. And while it is frustrating to not be rewarded for your own skill, i can understand that sloppy controls make you rely on your squad more.  It also seems to want to be Band of Brothers, the TV show. The game spends an enormous amount of time showing wooden characters (some of which are obviously derived from Band of Brothers characters, one of which even shares a voice actor) talking to each other about the war and each other. It spins narratives about cursed guns and lost loves which have exactly nothing to do with the game. The first ten minutes (not an exaggeration) is a series of unskippable cutscenes that awkwardly introduce a set of characters which it clearly wants you to be invested in. It keeps introducing new characters who have small quirks and different voice actors, but whom you really don't care about. When it kills off or maims a character, you're clearly expected to care, but there's no *reason* to care; the gameplay (controlling the position and focus of 1-3 fireteams) is identical no matter which characters are involved, and you're aways given replacements who are exactly as capable. Cutscene after cutscene is used, even with 'shaky-cam' effects and close-ups of expressionless faces. It's all the more frustrating because this came out a year after Bioshock, a game which is almost purely story-driven, uses the same engine, and yet falls into none of the gameplay or storytelling pitfalls that this game does.  Ultimately, it's a fun game that executes a squad shooter very well, despite the flaws. I'd recommend it if you're certain you want a squad shooter, and wouldn't recommend it for any other reason.",

            "review_text": "Hell's Highway feels a full generation away from it's predecessors - the graphics are vastly improved and the tech can finally tell the story with all the drama and tension that they've been aiming for since the beginning.   It also feels like a new generation in terms of the fact that a lot of the gameplay has been streamlined (grenade throwing has been tightened up, thank god), and, in my opinion, these changes have made the game easier. The new appearance of OP weapons like the bazooka team and the player-controlled tank make it a cakewalk to mop up whole squads of enemies in one shot. Your Thompson is also replaced early on with a barrel-cartridge tommy gun that feels like it never runs out of ammo. You can, with relative ease, stand back and pick off enemies from afar with the new cover system that allows you to peek around corners and focus your fire, and if you do happen to flank the enemy, often they'll stand straight up and into your squadmates' gunfire, dying in seconds. All these additions detract from the immersion, and make the game feel a little more arcadey, even thought the core gamplay mechanics are nearly identical to the previous games. All in all, this game feels much more polished and fancy, but loses some of the pulse-pounding, gritty tension of knowing that even if you're prepared, bum-rushing that dug-in squad could get you killed.  The one thing this does best is make you feel. By the last levels of the game, you'll almost want to stop playing, and the push through burning wreckages and sand dunes, being harried by multiple enemy squads, will feel dreadful, but you know that you have to keep pushing through in order to complete the mission, which is exactly how the characters feel. The narrative continues the story of Matt Baker, who is experiencing some deep PTSD/mental illness. It's incredibly bleak all the way through, and centres around a specific and almost rushed-through moment in the original game, which is retroactively filled out to fantastic effect for the player, explaining the actions of some of the characters all the way through the series. There is a subplot about a cursed weapon that it also tries to retrofit, but this doesn't stick quite as well.   So that's it - I've played all three games in the series, one after the other, in the space of a couple of weeks. This used to be my preferred game, and it's the one I've played most, but after playing them back to back, Earned in Blood is easily my favourite, and balances a quality narrative, with realistic and rewarding gameplay, a battlefield that sounds truly alive, memorable level design, and just the right level of difficulty that rewards good tactics. The original game falls on the side of being a little too clunky, and this falls on the side of being a little too streamlined, for my tastes. In saying that, because the narrative intertwines throughout the three games, you really must play all three in order to get the full effect. Clever move, Gearbox.  I recommend this more than RTH30, but less than EiB.",

The graphics were very well done and great to look at. The cut-scenes were long and enjoyable to watch. The Multiplayer is still active but very small. The game is very well done and I really enjoyed it all the way to the end. If your into FPS and enjoyed the previous Brothers in arms then dont pass this one up when you see it on sale.

This leads to strange situations where you are completely behind cover but can still be killed. Also actual combat is nowhere near as satisfying. One of the great things about the previous titles was that shooting someone was actually a challenge. It felt very realistic. This title scrapped that and went with your typical FPS style combat where you are basically 100% accurate 100% of the time.

Great replay value, the single player missions are always good to come back to with many ways of finishing the game, ranging from doing it all yourself, to not firiing a single shot and letting the squads do the work. The commands can be a bit of a fumble and can frustrate until learned.  Graphics easily rival Call of Duty, and most other shooters. The movement is not a fluid and free as some other shooters but it is plenty responsive enough. Excellent fall back game when waiting for the newer flashier games to come out, or if that fancy new game turns out to be a dud.  Runs perfectly fine on all windows from windows 8 to windows XP. A Solid buy that will be playable for years to come. - I have rebought a steam version to replace my damaged hard copy version.",

            "review_text": "*May contain minor spoilers, nothing huge*  I really enjoyed this game, I think it is great. You play as Sgt. Matt Baker in command of the 101st Airbourne in France during operation Market Garden. Being in command of your squad is really fun and engaging and makes you think about your approach to each situation, especially on the higher difficulty of Authentic. You use surpressing fire from your MG and Base of Fire teams to cover and move your Assault Team up and flank the enemy which is really satisfying when it works. The story is the best part of the game in my opinion. It would be best to play Road to Hill 30 and Bound in Blood prior to this to get a background to the story and be fully engaged in it. For a 2008 title it looks really nice on the Unreal 3 engine and the attention to detail in the uniforms and weapons is really cool. Of course it looks a bit dated by today's graphics but it's not all about the graphics anyway. It still holds up after 8 years.  However I think the ending is a bit abrupt and leaves you on a cliffhanger, and we haven't even had any news of a sequel since the game was released!! There are also some tank sections that seemed a bit too easy in my opinion. In addition I had to restart the game one time because the teams weren't firing upon enemies when I told them to but I only ran into this bug once.  I played the game with an Xbox controller and it felt like it controlled quite well. Also, the K98 is MUCH more accurate than the Garand (and probably anything else apart from the snipers) in this game.  Overall I reccomend this game. It's one of the last good WWII FPS games of last decade.",

            "review_text": "This game is pretty fun and not as much of a b-list game, as I expected for the price. This is a fairly linear, old-school WW2 shooter, with a cool squad factor. Beware of have far away you are and the path a squad might take though. I've had them basically commit suicide by running through enemy lines, rather than behind something.  You are part of a glider team that lands in Holland sometime after D-day, and basically have to move forward and clear out a lot of Nazis. There is also an interesting back-story that unfolds, involving the main character's engraved .45 pistol.  As far as the game mechanics they are pretty much what you would expect with standard motions, weapons and shooting. Strangely, there is no jumping, except for valting over a cover item. If the game recognizes an item as cover you can also vault it.  As far as the cover, pressing Q benind a solid wall or other solid item like vehicles will put you in in a temporary 3rd person cover mode, and you are crouched behind the cover item. Using the arrows allows you to move behind the cover or lean out to shoot. This mode also give you a a much finer cross-hair for aiming, and a much steadier aim. This is kind of cool, but also has a drawback, as you can' t control how far you lean out (or up if behind a wall). So when shooting from cover you have to expose yourself to multiple enemies. The method is to take fire until the view is starting to get pretty red, then go back into cover before dying-- and hopefully killing a Nazi or two in the process. This is a little lame and would be much better if you could lean just enough to sight in on a single enemy, depending on the positioning.  Another really lame thing is that when sprinting you can't change direction very much with the mouse. You can use A and D keys to kind of swerve--, but you basically have to stop sprinting to make a normal turn. This is very weird to get used to, and I can't imagine what the developers were thinking. Another weirdness is that while in cover and being flanked it is easy to get 'stuck' to the cover. The only way to get off is to move directly backwards, and that is easy to forget when under fire.  Still, in spite of these negatives, this is a pretty fun game, especially for the price.  If you think you would like an old-school, ww2, squad shooter with a decent story then skip a fast-food lunch and you'll have the cash for this game. Bon Appetit.",

            "review_text": "Brothers in Arms: Hell's Highway is the third game in the Brothers in Arms series and, in my opinion, the best. It has taken the good and the bad from the previous 2 games and vastly improved them. Better level design, the tactical map is more immersive, 2 knew additional teams to control (MG and Bazooka teams), and another amazing story told from the perspective of, now, Staff Sergeant Matthew Baker (again).   The Good:   The Hell's Highway's graphics were quite good when the game was first released and has held up reasonably well over time. The reinvisioned tactical map is incredibly immersive, and is authentic to what the Reconnaissance troops of the 101st Airborne Division would have. Killroy's are new to the series and are an interesting addition to the game, making me want to go back through each level and find all of them. Which brings up my next point: The replayability.   Hell's Highway is incredibly replayable. Before I purchased it on Steam I used to own it for my PS3 and I would play the hell out of it. Still, after many hours of playing it on the console, I continue to return to play through a few missions in the game. I continue to find new ways how to pin down German troops and outflank them either by myself or with my assault team.  The cover system is new to the series, and is a very good addition. From my experiance with Hell's Highway, and past titles in the series, the cover system has allowed me to better assess a situation and direct my troops, as well as improving my ability to engage German troops. It's always nice to get a slow motion action cam of a round from my M1 Garand going in to the skull of a Nazi.   The characters and the story of Hell's Highway are incredibly well done, with healthy amounts of character development and definition, and well done story arch with a cliffhangar of an ending. While the main theme of the story is Operation Market Garden, the actual story is about Baker dealing with PTSD from his experiances in Normandy. Baker also seems to be loosing his grip on his mind, as he contiues to see hallucinations of men that were killed in Normandy.   The Bad:  The lip syncing in the cinematic cutscenes could have be improved on, but they're not that much of an issue for me.   There's a few bugs with the AI's pathfinding abilities, and this will sometimes cause your own men to get killed, or get stuck on an object for a few seconds. It is really unimmersive and a bit of hassel, especially when you're in a firefight with huge amounts of lead going back and forth.  A few people have made complaints about the FOV, however I don't have an issue with it. But that's just me. I'm sure there are quite a few people who would have a serious problem with the FOV. Although there is a few ways to fix the FOV if you do have a problem with it, and you can easily find tutorials of this fix on the Steam community page or through a quick google search.  Overall:  Overall, I'd say this is probably one of the best damn WW2 shooters you can get. It's authentic, immersive, with great, replayable gameplay and an incredible story. The only downsides to the game would be the bugs with the AI.   So in the end I'm giving Hell's Highway a 9/10, and I would highly recommend it to anyone with an interest in WW2 shooters or squad based infantry tactics.",
