            "review_text": "Alright, I feel that I got the most of this game within my ~6hours of gametime. Let's see why exactly I clicked Not Recommended button.   Quick summary  Pros: -Fun, fast gameplay with some skill involved -Many heroes to play, all of them have distinctly different abilities -Loot system provides basic customization  Cons: -Horrible UI and overall lack of critical information -Poor dificulty curve, areas 1,2 are perfect, 3 is hard as hell and 4,5 are just a breeze. Same with area bosses -Certain areas have extremely repetative gameplay, spawn points allow for easy abuse -Almost no replayability aside from trying new hero  Breakdown  Gameplay: Wave based action with some loot and skill progression. 5 Areas, 5 bosses. Many different heroes to play. Simple and elegant.   Loot: You have 5 slots that you can equip dropped items to, there are few stats and around 10 Special Abilities attached to the items themselves. Not much creativity but does the job  Classes: Truly outstanding feature of this game, all classes feel different, have different tactics and MIGHT have a few distinct builds.   Hero skills: You have 4 skills (aside from 1 hero who has 7) and you can level them up. This will be very familiar to players of Risk Of Rain. 4 skills, 4 button to press. Usually is goes something like - basic attack, special attack, dodge ability and some sort of an ultimate, although it might vary from hero to hero.  UI: Horrible. Well, maybe close to horrible but still really really bad. When you try to compare pieces of equipment you only see stat comparison that is already on the previous item. Example - if your item has no armor but has cooldown reduction and if the new item has armor and has no cooldown reduction it will just show you +33 armor and will not compare non-existent stats. It is REALLY hard to compare items at a glance and you have to constantly switch from item to item to understand if you want to use one or another. Skills APPARENTLY have two different power levels, 1 is before you put 4 points into it and 1 is after. This is NOT mentioned anywhere and seems like a critical piece of information missing. Some skills SEEM to get new abilities with new power level - life steal, health regen etc , but that is also NOT mentioned anywhere, skill descriptions are only visible in tutorial and do not provide enough information. You have a certain level requirements to upgrade skill beyong certain level, but that is badly represented and the only indicator is that they are not hightlighed during the level-up process.   Movement: Very floaty, has almost no precision, hard to dodge certain attacks. Hitting flying enemies feels like a roulette as you cannot control angle of attacks  Mobs: Decent variety, some really cool designs, some (IMHO) horrible decisions on mob power. Area 3 has the most annoying Spearman that is basically harder than any boss of the game  Bosses: First 2 bosses are AS COOL AS THEY CAN BE! They are fun to fight, unique and present decent challenge. The rest are boring and super-easy to fight. Seems like the developer ran out of creativity\\time to polish them  Areas and levels: Hard to say. Some platfroms, some fires, some nice backgrounds. Nothing special, nothing bad.  Difficulty: Super-weird. First two levels are nicely balanced and present good challenge. Third Area is just super-hard due to one type of monster who can silence your attacks, slow you down AND teleport to you to punch you. One wrong move and you are dead. Fourth and fifth Areas are easy, I have not died once and never even came close to being in trouble. It seems that the late-game might not be balanced hence the weird difficulty curve  Replayability: In my opinion - none. Game is around 3 hours per run, by the end I felt tired and bored. Played a bit of horde mode, got even more tired and bored.  Overall: Nice game, but has very little to offer for the price. I would only recommend to buy it of huge sale, around 2-3 dollars just to try it out  Cheers!",

            "review_text": "This game is a joke. I kick started this and the devs have done nothing. Don't waste your time or money. If it was even free I wouldn't play this game. It really fell short of what I wanted. They stated it was inspired from risk of rain which I was really excited about. It is nothing like it and the only thing that can be similar to it is the pixel art. Devs are a joke and so is this game.",

The desync issues are so bad that you anyone who's not the host finds themselves dying across the map from an enemy that they can't see. This game was released from early access far too early. Would you put this on store shelves without a working multiplayer? There's little to no information on the internet about the actual functionality problems in this game so hopefully this will shed some light. Don't misunderstand me, this game is not bad, I find it really fun, but DO NOT buy this game until it's actually worth being f***ing called 'fully released'. There are posts back from March and April where the Devs said they were going to fix the desync bugs as fast as they could but nothing has changed as of yet.",

            "review_text": "Defenitely only purchase on SALE! I loved this game which makes me sad to not recommend it. It is extrememly buggy and makes additional gameplays of it difficult if not impossible unless you create new profiles.  My view:  The gameplay and the amount of options are excellent. Several heros to choose from and good item drop system. I initially got the game cause it looked like it was a good local co-op, and it was... to a point. Pros.  Excellent Game play  Easy learning curve to pick up and play  Waves get More difficult at each stage  Multiple characters and game plays  Local co-op increases difficulty for more players Cons.  The interface is terribly done. (After selecting a mode you may have to start the game and select quit to get back to the main menu!)  Not often, but some of the levels have acted... buggy. (One levels background was glitching... blinking in and out repeatedly. Only happened once.)  If you beat the game with a character in Single or Local Co-op that character can 'infect' other characters... as I would put it. (explanation: You can choose the level you go to after you beat the game with that character, but when you do local co-op, probably does the same in online co-op, if you select the character who beat the game, your friends character and your character go up against the final boss. Their character is now viewed as either being on the final level against the final boss or is viewed as beating the game and offered the level select next time they are played in single player mode.)   If you get this game I would recommend getting it on sale because of most of the interface bugs that make it hard to call 'user friendly'. If you get this game, have fun, good luck, and try not to get frustrated with the interface, and if they make a second one of these games I may still have to get it cause the game play was good, but I hope they fix these issues and make more replayability.  Local co-op recommendations:  I would also recommend beating the game with one profile, in single or co-op, so you have all the characters and always loading that profile when you start. Then when your friend joins you to play or if you simpley want to start a new profile with all the characters, go to story and select local multi-player, then load the newly created profile. This will allow your new profile and your local friends new profile to access all the characters through the initial profile (The characters will start at whatever level you had them at, so you won't be on the final boss and they won't be Level O.P.)",

            "review_text": "I wasn't really sure what to expect when I picked this game up, but I have to say I'm enjoying it so far.  Gameplay is pretty simple in concept. Survive all the waves and murder the shadow monsters. It plays a little like risk of rain in the respect of hordes of monster all trying to murder you and your grinding them for coins and gear. Each character is pretty unique to eachother, but similar enough that switching charaters feels pretty smooth.  The art is all around really good. Sprites are good. Animation is good, especially boss intros. Music seems to get better and better.  I can see this being a really great co-op game for people who have a Risk of Rain shaped hole in their hearts. I plan on playing a lot more of this.  The price tag might be a little high for some people who don't have that hole in their hearts, and I did get it on sale myself, but I can solidly recommend it if it's about 50% off to anyone.",
