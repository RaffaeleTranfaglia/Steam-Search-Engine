    "description": "POLYBIUS is a fast, trippy tunnel shooter playable on a normal screen or in VR. 50 levels of blissful trance shooting action are set to a blistering soundtrack. The PS4 version was EDGE Magazine's VR GOTY in 2017, and the PC version of the game was even used as the basis for a NIN music video.",
