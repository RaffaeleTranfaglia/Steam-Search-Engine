            "review_text": "Beat Hazard is a top down dual stick arcade shooter similar to the classic game Asteroid, but on neon colored steroids. Its pretty much contained in a single screen and the game throws waves of asteroids, ships and space worms after you. Since its a dual stick shooter, the controls are easy, left stick to move, right stick to fire the direction you're aiming. There are also bombs to clear the screen when it gets completely full of enemies.   Beat Hazard has a major twist. Your rate of fire is controlled by the tempo or beats per minute of the music. Not just your bullets but the enemy speed too. If you don't care for the songs that the game comes with, you can play one of your own .mp3s or listen to Internet radio. The neon laser beams make the game come to life as more than a game. It could be a visualizer for your mp3 playlist.  Every song is a level. When the song ends or your lives run out, you see your high score and the game remembers how far you got and your high score. So you can play it again for a better high score or to go further in the song. I'd much rather have the game go from song to song than force me to start up a new game for the next song. There is a survival mode that will keep going song to song, but its just a single life.  The enemy diversity shines through in the game. There are simple ships that fly in long waves. Larger ships that take more damage. Even larger ships that explode into a hail of homing missiles. Still other ships have dual repulsor beams to push you around. Magnetic ships have dual rays that pull you in. There are segmented space worms, easier to defeat neon worms. It is a varitable feast. Not just that, but diverse bosses. Everything from huge space ships, gigantic worms to star fish that coil up their tentacles for protection. These enemies will fill your screen in no time especially on the upper three difficulties. The game has a way to keep your mind engaged as to how you can survive.  Every score that you have go to your level or rank. The score is like experience. You will rank up and get to unlock a perk. You need to buy the perk once its been unlocked. Not just buy it, but buy multiples of it. Then equip it. There are perks that give you extra lives, extra bombs, and increase score multipliers. Other things that can get unlocked are extra difficulty modes for when 'hardcore' gets too easy for you.  There are other layers of complexity to the Beat Hazard such as a risk reward system. If you don't shoot a set amount of time your score multiplier goes up. If you survive long enough without dying, the multiplier goes up again. Before you know it you're at 45+ of a score multiplier if not 100+ with perks. All the while enemies will drop things for you to pickup such as extra multipliers, money, bombs to use, power ups for your laser and volume increases. Its very risk or reward. Do you leave your safe corner of the screen, navigate through the madness to get your $10?  The game is kind enough that when you die, it litters the area with items to get you back up and competing again. That is a downfall of other games that if you die late into a game, your underpowered ship is useless against the high difficulty enemies.  If you get lonely there is 2 player and online multiplayer where you compete on a single screen against someone. Not just that, but the game will notify you if someone is trying to multiplayer at that time. You can interrupt your own game to play against someone. This ensures there's always someone to play.  I say this game is well worth the $10 asking price.",

Due to the unpredictability of the music used, it somehow heightens the difficulty level even while on easy mode!   And be warned, as I noticed. When the music is somewhat slow/soft, so as your bullet speed. But when it gets loud/fast or even accented, that's when your bullet speed is manipulated as it is shot.  I think this is highly recommended for people who love bullet hell genres and interactive-music-simulation games. Or people who love to 'modify' the background music to suit their playing style. Just as in Osu!, but with bullet barrage more than rhythm. I would give this a 4.5/5, for those who are looking for ratings.",

            "review_text": "'Beat Hazard Ultra' - Review  Gameplay: 6/10 A fun game. Modern effects meets old skool arcade gameplay. If Galaga was invented today this game would be it. If you're a fan of the acrade syle or want a bit of nostalgia with a modern twist, then this game is for you. The basic idea on which the gameplay is based doesn't change, but the in-game options, level ups, currency and extras add a little variety to mix it all up nicely enough to entertain. Initially the gameplay feels tricky if not strange and unintuitive, however over time it becomes a bit more like second nature rather than stressful frustration.  Game ambiance: n/a  Reliability/Stability: 10/10 No crash or instability issues to report.  Story/Plot: n/a  Concept: 7/10 Arcade style games like this have been available since the 70's. To think that a new one can be created today, so successfully, is almost astonishing. The classic arcade space-themed gameplay is offset with the original idea of not only incorporating your own music playlist, but having the game react and respond to the music. This certainly brings a fun new perspective to this genre.  Concept execution: 7/10 With many features such as multilayer online co-op gameplay with friends, perks, power-up's and a variety of single player modes, this game will keep you busy for a while. Or at least, as lite fun goes, it'll entertain you enough until you decide which major title you want to play next.   Textures: 5/10 Generally speaking the textures in Beat Hazard are average for a game, but not underdeveloped. You could say they are just enough and nothing more. This can be forgiven however as the focus of this game is more about beat triggered special effects and skill rather than mind blowing textures.   Modelling: 5/10 Again, the modelling isn't necessarily the main aspect of this game, and again like the textures, it is just enough. They are enough to allow the game experience to be enjoyable and that's the whole point.  Graphics: 8/10 The special effects in this game are dizzying, strobing and seizure inducing. Glorious if you like it, hideous if you don't. Either way you can't deny it's extremely colorful and eye -twitchingly pretty. Turn the room lights off, the screen brightness up and strap yourself into your favorite spaceship!  Sound: 6/10 The sound isn't too bad, given the premise of this game revolves around music. It's what you'd expect from an arcade game but with a more modern production quality. Love it or hate it the volumetric and situational dynamics are there, perhaps a little overdone and exaggerated, but then it does have to stand side-by-side with the huge visuals. If you enjoy shooting spaceships with big audible bangs and explosions then you'll defiantly have fun here.   Music: 10/10 I have to give this 10/10 for music because it's comprised from my personally playlist. You will too unless you couldn't care less about music, in which case this game might not be to your taste.  Adjustable shadow mapping: No Bonus/Extras: none ",

            "review_text": "Beat Hazard is a true gem in the widths of indie games. Basically being only a programme that analyses the amplitudes of a music track and thus sending various enemies at your laser-equipped space ship in a 2D top down view, it takes full effect after hours and hours of playing it casually.  Alongside gaming skyscrapers like Crysis or Counter-Strike, it's the tiny pizza stall in between where you go from time to time - like, casually. You feel the need, the motivation to just play a round of it, from time to time - not for long, just a few good tracks, and that's it. Until your next visit, in a few days.  Besides, Beat Hazard has developed (or has been developed) continously. It started as the basic game and received two major updates, both the two boosting the game's variability and extent, giving it new game modes, bosses, enemies and the ability of creating own ships (Shadow Operations Unit DLC). And while it was growing, it never lost its easy-to-learn usability.  Everyone interested in music should give this a try - it doesnt matter if you're going casual in this or seek a challenge for there are lots of leaderboards to improve on. And yes, if you haven't heard of it yet: Better get some sunglasses. Just in case :)  ",

Deciding to make the workshop available ONLY with DLC was a LAME unnecessary and greedy choice for this developer. Workshop content can keep a game fresh and new thus keeping it alive with community driven content.

You can also play cooperatively (Co-op) or competitively (PvP) with a friend, it's extremely fun, especially if you both have the same taste in music.  This really is a fun game to pickup and play just a song (or a full album!) every once in a while.  I highly recommend getting the Beat Hazard: Ultra DLC (it adds new weapons, new bosses, new game modes, etc.).

            "review_text": "Two recommendations are posted here, one for the Shadow OPs DLC and my original one for the Beat Hazard Ultra.  Shadow Operations recommendation (18 Apr 2014):  A very fun DLC that lets you create your own ships, upload the ships to the workshop, and download other player's ships from the workshop. When creating your ship, you can choose from several attributes such as the ship's size, how fast/slow it accelerates, top speed, how fast/slow it decelerates, how strong the bullets are, how fast the bullets move, position of the guns, whether or not you repel or attract perks, how many beams (1-3), and more. You also get to set up to three missions for your creation so you can make them easy, hard, or a mix. As you gain higher ranks, you unlock some nice cosmetic attributes such as flares and engine thrust colour. It really is a lot of fun and it gives you new ways to enjoy Beat Hazard.  Any song with the Shadow OPs icon next to it has a chance to spawn what you need for missions. Additional info from a quote from Starg: 'The 'play random track' and 'one I've not played before' will also automatically choose a song that fits the current mission criteria.'   Original recommendation I wrote for the game (23 July 2013):  I bought this before the sale ended, after having played the demo, and I have to say, it's pretty damn fun. I explode a lot but that's part of the fun for me, destruction to all!!! mwahahaha. The game is wicked cool and I'm glad I bought the complete package so that I have all the nuts &amp; bolts to fiddle with. It's interesting trying out different songs from my computer, some of them get so intense that there's so much going on on the screen that I lose track of, well, everything. Some of my songs have lulls in them where I'm sitting in space twiddling my thumbs getting the Daredevil (and the other one, I forget the name), counting up. I've only played around 26 minutes so far, as far as the in-game counter goes, but it's been fun.",

I'm biased for these kinds of games since I like challenging arcade games and music-powered games, so you'd think I'd like this one. Yes, well... not really.  (Mind you, I'm in no way photosensitive like some others who have left a negative review on this game have been, and I can handle rapid flashing just fine, but if it becomes gameplay-inhibiting, then the design is absolutely flawed.)  Problems with the game: * Often screen-filling visual effects that prevent you from seeing what is going on. You can't dodge bullets if you can't see them... * Overboard on the 'flashy sparkly fireworks' effects. I mean, way overboard, and then some. It's not 'cool', it's not 'attractive', and it gives you a headache if you're not careful. * The music plays very soft. I have properly balanced music files and they simply don't play at a decent volume in the game - for a music-focused game you'd expect the audio component to be at least adequate and give priority to proper playback without having to amplify it into clipping ranges. * Scoring is meaningless: levels are random, so what rewards you get and points you score for a song is not dependent on the music at all. Score is determined by chance and not by skill, as a result. * Music-based firepower will favor even, loud songs. You get a dynamic song with breaks and softer parts and you're pretty much at the mercy of whatever random fleets of ships are thrown your way with no way to fight them off. And woe if you hit a quiet spot when a boss is thrown at you. Good luck with that, get ready for a grind. * Screen-filling visual effects that.. Ohwait, I already said that. :P Yes, it's a problem. Worthy of mentioning twice. It kills the ability to properly play a 'bullet hell' game. Period. ",

Imagine my surprise when i came across this, a game based on music. I can't say that the bizarre sounds I've come to find enjoyable are my usual fair as far as my previous musical enjoyment in the 16th century goes, but this, 'video game,' as you modern people call it, is quite interesting. It seems like a good use of time, and it brought a lot of laughter to my life - and as we know, laughter is the best medicine.   It's not better medicine than collecting a bunch of crap from my backyard and boiling it into a potion and then giving it to dying patients to drink in the hopes that they'll somehow survive the Plague, but  that  problem has mostly been dealt with through 'modern medicine.' - So what's a plague doctor to do? I guess, learn about new music that makes use of this, 'Electricity.' I must say, combining the two has been extremely pleasurable.   I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed this. It smells almost as sweet as the herbs and spices I stuff into my mask beak. They deserve your monetary support and compensation for making it. A miasma of happiness? I think so!  Modern people like percentages. I would give it..let's see...85%! Yes! 85%! The only thing that could make it better? More explosions.

Your firepower, the enemies, amount of enemies on screen, and speed are all determined by your songs. (FYI - fast/loud songs are not the hardest). Say you have a song that starts off playing a lot, lots of ships and such come out, you have lots of firepower and life is chaotic. Then you song takes one of those quiet spells. Well the enemies are still on screen but they start to move slow and shoot slow. Unfortunately for you, you also shoot slow. You get the idea.  This can be a very fast game and your screen will be full of color! If you think it can't get any fuller, try playing 2 player with 2 ships fighting off everything. Just remember, all you have to do is survive to the end of your song....  If you buy the entire package, this game will play almost any format song. I even play certain videos for their audio.",

Pros: + You can pick any song from your computer and it's most likely gonna work (*.mp3, *.wav, *.ogg) + If you manage to buy it in 50% or higher sale, you're gonna have a lot of fun for very fair price! + It has Single Player and also local Multi Player included + Achievements, Trading Cards (=&gt; Badges), quite cool emoticons and usable profile backgrounds  Cons: - Almost every bigger feature requires DLC and this is very annoying! I understand this game is quite cheap so they can't just sell everything for the base price and they didn't want to make it higher. However I find it rather stupid to buy 3 DLCs to unlock Online Multi Player, iTunes Support and the ship changing feature. Luckily enough, these DLCs are included in pack with the game and it saves you a bit of money and it's usually in sale at the same time as the game - Tracks Indexing system is a little bit messy for beginners, but it's easy to get used to it  TL;DR: 9/10 - Great game for reasonable amount of money with DLCs in case the game is not entertaining enough for you anymore.",

Death Waltz has new meaning! -Any song that goes quiet for the bridge is DEADLY -The money system is not quite intuitive.... I end up with less money than I collect over the level (this is probably me being dumb though) -Not so much a con but it would be nice to be able to link youtube videos or music websites the same way we can do internet radio  Final thoughts: This game is awesome! The level generation based on music is done beautifully making it difficult but never impossible. It is visually overwhelming but in the most beautiful way.

It's a pleasant game for when you want to zone out and enjoy sound and color. There's not a lot there, but it's a pleasant enough game. You're more likely to die in many cases from having trouble determining which bright flashing thing is going to kill you than from legitimate in-game challenges.  'Shadow Missions' and perk unlocking add a mild sense of progression to the game, but otherwise no storyline or plot exists.

I heard of this game from a friend who had it on his phone, I thought the game was pretty cool and I'd eventually get it for myself since I'm such a huge fan of EDM and so I did 3 years later. I was happy to play it after seeing it for the first time a while ago. But I did make a huge mistake, I played on 200% visual intensity. After 2 hours of playing I started to get a headache. This didn't effect my look on the game I just played it on 75% VI from then on. If what I just said might be concern for you then this definetly not the game for you. This game is NOT for everybody, I suggest it to EDM junkies and metal heads. Not to say it doesn't work with other genres it is just best played with them. 70% of my music is EDM, 15% is anime openings and endings, and the other 15% is indie pop, my second highest scoring song is an anime ending. Overall if you're an average person who listens to mainstream pop this is probably not your game, but if you're fan of the Monstercat label company or if you're a die hard metal head you're going have a hella good time. And if you really liked the game the DLC makes it even better. 9/10 F*** yeah I'm still playing.",

It really does seem the ONLY thing that affects the gameplay is the tempo/intensity of the music. Slow bit? Slow enemies. Fast bit? Faster enemies! Everything else seems to happen at random, like boss battles, the spawning and location of enemies and their types, ect. However, most of that can be changed by the difficulty of the enemies, rather than changing the song. So what does the music do? Well, it mostly gives intense seizures, but that's a common thing.  It's still a fun bullethell game, and it's fun to play it all with your favorite album blasting in the background. It's also one of the VERY rare music games out there that support online play. If the game can match two of the same MP3's on each other's computer, you can play together. Very simple, and works really well... if there's not much latency between you and your opponent.  The game is very extensive and has lots of modes to keep you playing for a long time, but if you're looking for a game where the final amazing '♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ up' shot is timed with the best part of the song, try something else.

You don't need to play it with just your standard electro pop that you think might be most appropriate, one of my most frentic games was when I played Home by Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeroes. There is a fair amount of skill involved, and you'll need to heighten your spatial awareness to pay attention to what's going on (one of the DLC's includes an option to downgrade the visual effects, if you're that kind of person). There's even a persistent upgrade system and missions and leaderboards and online play (which I haven't tried yet) and local multiplayer (which I also haven't tried yet). It's a fun ♥♥♥ bundle of a cheap game that'll rock for you if you've got music on your computer, or want to rediscover the music that's already there.   I can't recommend this game enough, there's so much to it. I'd like to think that if you projected it on a screen at a dance party it'd be a ♥♥♥♥ing blast.

You can turn the intensity down -enough to ensure that you can easily spot targets and hazards- but not really get rid of it. That would kind of ruin the game- the intense is both its visual style and its identity, in a way.  It's all about letting the scenes wash over you, subconciously taking in the location of all the enemies, bullets and yourself, while your music swells and dips. The feeling of disjointment when you die and the volume drops back down actually becomes your motivation to try harder, so that you can do your favourite songs justice.  As for the Ultra DLC, it's basically one of the best expansions I've ever bought. It adds so much content to the game it's unbelievable.

When you start playing, you don't really see how it goes at the rythm of your songs. But after some time playing, you'll start to realize that it really does go at the rythm of your songs. It's hard to notice though, since Beat Hazard require quite a lot of focus on the ennemies and incoming projectiles. Despite that, Beat Hazard is a hardcore and very addicting game. If you love shooters, this is an excellent game for you.  HOWEVER, I do have to give some warnings. DO NOT BUY IF YOU SUFFER FROM EPILIPSY. This game has A LOT of flashing lights and effects. And when I say a lot, I really do mean a lot.   If you do not suffer from epilipsy, please, take breaks after an hour of play. I know, I sound like someone who says you should take break after an hour of playing video games, but no. Beat Hazard is a special case. After playing for like 1 hour, I started to have an headache, and plus, my eyes started to feel tired. And I'm not making this up. So please, if you're going to play this excellent game, take care of yourself, and take a break after an hour of consecutive play.    Overall, you should buy this game. I highly recommend it. I also recommend that you play with a controller. ;)",

Shadow Operations Unit DLC has literally NO new ships anymore, Steam Workshop's 'most rated content in the week' doesn't put most rated content, instead it basically puts random usermade ships that are from 2014 and by far there's no 2016 usermade ship, which proves that people no longer play this game as much as before, which means also that no one makes ships in Beat Hazard anymore...

This game is a mix of Audiosurf and Geometry Wars, except spaceships ships instead of shapes.  If you you like those games you'll have lots of fun with this one.  The steam workshop for this game is overwhelming great. Playing with ships that others have made really bring a whole new life to the game.  Those of you who enjoy playing along with your music, it is a must have game. The game at full price is a bargain compared to how long and how much fun you'll have and get it on sale kinda feel like stealing. But this has only been my experience.   Con: When you browse the music you have the broswer in game always starts at the top instead of being on the folder you were just in, even if you just finished a song. So you have to scroll down the folder again if you wish to continue to move down the list of other folders of music you have. Gets annoying, but not a deal breaker.",
