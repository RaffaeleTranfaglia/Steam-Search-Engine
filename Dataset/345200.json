            "review_text": "If you like Eat 'em up games, you will really like this one. From its great animation to its amusing music (Sometimes).  + Very Fluid Animations + Nice Backgrounds + Addictive Gameplay + Great price!  - Not so great transitions into each level (Not really following on to the last events) - Story would have been more entertaining if there were more of it. - Gets a bit repetitive half way through the game.  I clocked 4 hours on this game (Not including the Bonus Levels). Found it best to play in small amounts which I am pretty sure it was designed for anyway. Would definitely play a sequel as this one was very addictive. For such a cheap price for a game that would normally go for a little more its not bad at all.  My opinion is if you are bored and want to play a casual game where you devour literally everything on the screen its a good past time. (Also turn on Carnage mode if you are interested in many blood puddles from your excessive chomping)",

            "review_text": "The game is easier when you control your little terror fish with the mouse. But I can play this game only for about 1 hour before my hand hurts because the fish moves so fast sometimes. The game itself is more something for... when you're really bored and you don't know what to do. But it is certainly fun when you need something to have fun. Yeeees, the game get's boring after awhile (after at least 1 hour). But it is nice and if you want to kill some boredom... this is your game!",

            "review_text": "If you like 'Feeding Frenzy' type games, this is definitely one to check out. Solid mechanics, catchy music, easy to learn, and a wide variety of levels.  I think what makes this one more interesting than most Flash games of the same type is just how far it will go, as often you'll be eating whales thinking 'what could possibly be next' as ships, jets, and krakens start showing up.  Another reason I'd reccomend this game is some of the levels are very unique, including one where you start out falling from the sky. They do a good job of breaking up the tedium.  Anyway, if you like 'smaller fish eats things until it eats bigger fish' kinda game play this is definitly one to check out.",

            "review_text": "This is how I imagine Popcap would design a Katamari clone. It is fast, goofy, has often-questionable hit meshes, even-more-so questionable animal-to-world scales, and it's a lot of fun while it lasts. It is certainly no Katamari, nor shares the polish and budget of a Popcap title, but if you like a game that doesn't take itself seriously, you'll probably like this game.  The game is short - I finished in just over 2 hours. It is split into levels which chronicle the lives of three different aquatic animals as they grow to monster sizes. The game really shines when it drops you into a large body of water with a large variety and population of things to eat. This becomes very apparent as soon as you encounter the boring and frustrating oyster levels which there are two of. You'll know what I mean when you get there. There are also bonus levels at the end which offer some more fun after the campaign.  If you let yourself just steep in the ridiculousness of this title, you'll surely enjoy it while it lasts. Minor things like keyboard controls, repetitive (but often totally bangin') music, and those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ oyster levels might make you want to kill yourself briefly, but that's just a sign you've been playing this game for too long at a time. I finished my 2-hour playthrough in three sittings.   If you still want the game at this point, I wholeheartedly recommend it because it's downright fun for the price.",

            "review_text": "Tasty Blue; Having completed this game in normal mode and tried all the bonus levels, I have a few things to say...  PROS:  -You get to be a number of cute aquatic characters that get the opportunity to eat or be eaten in the wild world of the great blue sea, which is fun. -The music is quirky and light hearted -There's a bit of a story (although I'll get to this in more detail) -The gameplay over all is cute and cartoony, ideal for children.  CONS:  -Levels very repetitive in terms of what you can do/eat and your characters abilities. -The story was promising to begin with. Three scenarios are lined up for you to experience; the goldfish that gets overfed and escapes their prison of a bowl, the opressed dolphin that makes their escape from the mediocrity of jumping through hoops for its human overlords entertainment and the genetically engineered shark that was created to defeat the other two monster characters, but decided it was still hungry afterwards. HOWEVER, I personally felt like there could have been a slightly more in depth story, which may have broken up the repetitiveness of each characters plights. However these story introductions leave me wanting to know about more of a follow up to the characters. -Continuity issues: One level I've grown to the size of a house, and am EATING houses, the next, I'm back to the size of a tuna fish... why? I thought there was a linear story happening here...? Also, orcas that are half the size of helicopters. -Same old ability: space to boost, space to boost, space to boost..... Shouldn't different creatures ahve different perks?  In conclusion; 'Feeding Frenzy' did it better. Seriously, if you're considering buying this game for your kids, sure, go for it, but if you like the mechanic of playing as a creature that must eat or be eaten, and consequently grow and eat bigger things, look up Feeding Frenzy. It's fantastic, and has a great story with a touch of mystery beautiful artwork, and each character has specific attributes and abilities.  Do I recommend this game?  For kids, sure, but go google Feeding Frenzy anyway.",

Its not very hard at all and I cannot believe how much fun I just had for $5, I am so glad I bought it and would gladly recommend it. There is only 1-2 spots that may be difficult for kids I belive and that is the Oysters where you have to eat the pearls. Thats the only speed bump I had through this game and OMG the ending level is so friggin hilarious! You must play it atleast once!",
