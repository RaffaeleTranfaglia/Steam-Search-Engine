            "review_text": " Not Very Exciting   I played this with my girlfriend (who likes classic beat-em-ups such as Streets of Rage 2) and after Act 1's boss we said, 'Ok let's keep playing!'  But as we played, our enthusiasm kept dropping slowly. There wasn't really much to the game. There are only 4 acts and our characters became so over-powered by the end of the game that we just wanted to get it over with. We didn't even use the special, power enhancing crystals once.  -  Graphics  are nice but sometimes I lost my character in some chaotic battles. The Act 1 boss was the only unique fight in the entire game (except MAYBE the last boss, but that's pushing it). -  Music  was fine (some of it sounding like Golden Axe at times) -  Sound  needed more 'umph' to make me feel like my hits were doing any damage. The sound could have helped make the game more exciting if they put more effort into it. -  Controls  were easy but the game can be beaten with one simple attack combo for the entire time and then the 'special move' saved for boss fights.  As of this writing the game sells for $15 (before sale discounts) and I'd have to say I'd pay at most half that price for Sacred Citadel if you have run out of beat=em-ups to play.",

If you are looking for couch-coop, this game supports up to three players.  BTW. people are unfair.

You get 4 classes to play, online multiplayer, TONS of weapons/armors/etc... items you loot from enemies or buy from town. I haven't beaten the game yet, but unless something game breaking happens i intend to stand by my recommendation.",

Kind of a Capcom Dungeon and Dragons arcade game mashed up with Golden Axe and some Final Fight sprinkled on top, with a great art style.  There are 4 diffrent classes, about 5 diffrent combos/moves to unlock per class, juggle, gound and pound, knockbacks, behind the back attack, elemental weapons, armors, mounts to ride, lots of baddies, and some epic bosses.   It can be a bit botton mashy (like all early to mid 90's beat-em ups) and to make yer class a badass you will have to grind some, it's a fun grind tho. They give you diffrent tasks to complete: no dieing, time limit, and score when you replay levels.",

Along with it's decent graphics and effects for its genre, the soundtrack is on point and enjoyable as well as the combo's you can perform. The levels aren't terribly challenging and you can finish the game solo, so I recommend you accept the challenges in the towns before each level. I've yet to play in co-op (both local and online) because not a lot of people have this game yet. So buy it, have a gander at each of the classes, run through the game with your favourite one, and then finally meet me in online rooms. Coles approved.",

            "review_text": "I managed to enjoy this game for a smashing 3 hours, before it turned into a ♥♥♥♥ storm.  Single-player got boring really quickly so I found myself enjoying the multiplayer with friends. Yes, I said 'enjoying'.  All of a sudden we started to run into problems. Neither of us could connect to eachother, so naturally we started to look at our connections - nothing wrong. Everything ran fine, we had no connection trouble but yet we couldn't connect to eachother in the game. After doing various of things such as restarting routers, reinstalling the game, seeing if firewall or anti-virus programmes blocked we still couldn't play.  Before all that - when the game actually did work, we ran into many bugs. Such as:  - Not being able to pick up and/or equip offhand weapons that dropped during 'dungons' even when we switched weapons around. - Random lag issues - Enemies getting stuck off-screen not letting you finish whatever section we were on - Enemies not appearing  With the company who created this pile of rubbish being closed down nor will we see any updates and bug fixes.  Graphically it looks alright. That's when you look past the fact, that you can't set the resolution to higher than 1600x900 - so playing in fullscreen wasn't really an option. I found myself being forced to run it in window mode which felt annoying.  Want to play with a controller? Well get an xbox 360 controller then. And don't you dare to touch the keyboard before you have reached the 'press start' screen. Otherwise, everything will pop up with keyboard instructions (while you can still use the controller).  It simply lack settings. For instance, when the multiplayer actually did work for us we liked to hang around on a voice com. Playing with a controller and not wanting to reach for the keyboard everytime we wanted to use push-to-talk, we set the activation button to LB (on the xbox 360 pad) seeing as that button isn't used in the game. Just to found out - pressing LB in the lobby opens up whatever team mates steam profile in the steam overlay. Annoying! And there's no way in the settings you can rebind that.  Is it worth €9.99? Absolutely not! Even the €2 euros I paid for it is stretching it.  No matter what cost, I can't recommend anyone to get this, unless they want to travel through a short and boring single player campaign, and only being able to play with friends sometimes.",

You can juggle enemies, stunlock enemies, stack-up enemies and then stun and juggle them - 99X combos are not hard to do etc. etc.  There's challenge modes for every level - a reasonable amount of loot, the classes are maybe a BIT samey (but in a co-op game you maybe don't want big class variations?), environments can hide loot (not sure if good or bad thing?)
