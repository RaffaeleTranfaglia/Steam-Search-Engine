I just can't rate this positive when your character the piggy achieves flight by eating beans and farting. This has free Android app written all over it! The price isn't bad all things considered but there are better ways to spend $3.  This game does offer some cool building elements, you have to use additional items in order to clear a path for your farty pig to fly! I enjoyed this aspect of the game the most for sure! Overall, this game isn't terrible but not creative enough in all areas to get me excited enough to vote positive.   Worth $0-2.99 based on how low your expectations are. There are 50  amazing  levels.     Accidently Reviewed",
