            "review_text": "I think I’ve never played a game as  Monstro: Battle Tactics . This game is best described as a mixture of turn based tactical battles with a puzzle game, in the sense that you have to find the correct way and order to take out the enemy units or complete a certain objective without getting your troops killed.  The story of the game is presented to you in the form of an introductory cutscene and via little text windows at the beginning of every mission. The game takes place in Ludus, a place where monsters,mythical creatures and humans live in peace but once in every hundred years the Skygods summon some sort of floating islands, with perfectly shaped squares, in order to humans and monsters fight among themselves for the amusement of the gods.    Core gameplay:    The gameplay is pretty simple and easy to understand but, however, this doesn’t mean that the game doesn’t offer a challenge, it is quite the opposite. On each mission you’ll have control over one or more units, and usually your objective is either to slay all enemy units or to eliminate a certain enemy. The loss condition, of course, is not to loose all your units. Sounds simple enough, right? This is where Monstro: Battle Tactics really shines, it takes a simple and easy to learn gameplay formula and makes it challenging and hard by turning the fights and the levels themselves into puzzles of some sort. What I mean by this is that you’re able to move your units as you see fit, but most often the not, if you don’t plan ahead and find the correct order to attack and which enemies to go after first, you’ll end up loosing pretty quickly. Still, no need to worry about restarting the level since the game kindly offers you an “undo” function.  The game adds some variety to this by putting you against different types of enemies with different stats and by putting down some traps and movable and destructible walls. Your units also have their own stats, and some might even have specializations which increases a certain stat of a given unit. It is also in this sense that each mission is somewhat of a puzzle, because you have to compare your units stats with the enemies and figure out if you have what it takes to take the enemy down before it takes you.    Pros:    Nice and clean pixel art style   Really good sountrack   5 different campaigns, each with hand crafted levels    Hilarious and funny dialogue   Simple and easy to learn but yet challenging gameplay     Cons:    Dialogue can be somewhat confusing to understand at times   Story could be a bit more developed   Some missions have a steep learning curve   Could use more unit variety     Verdict: ",
