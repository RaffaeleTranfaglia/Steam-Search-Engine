            "review_text": "Stratego in space. If you are not ok with Stratego, it probably isn't the game for you.  The UI feels... compatible with mobile. This is a turn off for some. The mobile UI compatibility didn't feel like a significant hinderance in this game (it has in others). Don't go into this expecting an experience that is optimized for desktop.  The gameplay itself has skirmish, which is your classic Strategoesque environment. There is also a campaign which allows for unlocking additional opponents. The campaign has asymmetry to the pieces.  There are variations on the power scale compared to the more 'pure' numerical environment of Stratego. There is a piece that always wins if it attacks, and always loses if it is attacked. There are fighters - which you can move two per turn and have two attack the same spot. There are mines - which behave like mines... except for the bit that light fighters aren't blown up by them.  The board placement area has more options than the number of ships - some mobility there. The black holes (those circle things in the center) allow for slingshot movement, which can give fighters (with lots of movement) some sometimes surprising movement options.  I'm not overly impressed with the AI, but its not awful. There's the 'I sent that fighter down the outside edge to scout out that ship and... oh, I won.' Incidentally, there is an achievement for that.  All in all, its what I expected and would be on the 'I'll play it again' side of things. I got it on a 25% off sale and that felt about right. If you're on the fence, wait for a bigger sale or wait to see if it comes out for mobile at a lower price point.",
