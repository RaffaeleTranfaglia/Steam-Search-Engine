            "review_text": "I got this game for $6. 100% worth it.  Is it worth $40? No. And only because at $40+ I expect a story mode/campaign. Im the type that enjoys a story with my rts games.  Please note: the game has an official expansion that is free but installed in the in-game mod menu. This expansion basically doubles the game content. like 100+ more units, new avatars, everything. Its crazy. Also, it plays well with the current content.  ------------- GAMEPLAY ------------- Lots of different unit and building options. The great thing, the options are actually meaningful. So far I dont think Ive actually come across a unit that I think is bad. The balance is great. There isnt an 'I WIN' type of unit/build or play style. At least not at my noob level.  ------------ AI ------------ Honestly, kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Mind you, I was playing at normal difficulty. The commanders, the unit you are trying to kill to win the game...it doesnt even try to avoid death. It rushes into battle. From what Ive read, hard mode is a drawstic leap in difficulty from normal.  WAIT THOUGH.... QUELLER AI MOD.  The moment Ive started using this...the game is soooo much better. AI actually scales nicely to my ability.   --------------------- Multiplayer --------------------- Ive been playing with and against a friend. Looks like the current winter sale has a bunch of new players playing. The forums seem active enough. I dont think finding games should be too difficult. It might mean you need to go into the steam community and ask for people to play with that are at your level, but its active enough to enjoy.  multiplayer works.  ---------------  Overall, if you like rts games, this is a great addition and worth getting. Id say $30 or less is worth it.",

What they could have done is fixed the base game and had the new units as dlc. And I've noticed that the PA: TITANS has some issues too. Titans are too easy to get very early on in the game which makes the rest of the match a cake walk (atleast vs AI since I was playing the campaing) and I'm not very good at rts games and thought normal would be a challenge for me since I'm not good at the whole macro stuff. Well turns out that the normal bots are more like passive and I ended up completeting galactic war at the second hardest difficulty with no real challenge. And I also noticed a few performance issues can't really say if it was my video card not being powerful enough but in the previous game I ran the game fine at 60 fps even with a large number of units, but in titans my fps dropped to 28 pretty soon so I put my graphics to medium but that only postponed the inevitable fps drop. And when I start the game up there is a loud white noise that last for about a second but is still very annoying.   Conclusion: New units are nice but feel a bit overpowered and the game performs worse then the orignal atleast for me.",

Not least the devs shamefull display of promising such essential things like improved naval combat and more complex planet geography in there kickstarter and then locking these features behind the paywall that is PA titans.   - Game is buggy, laggy and crashes/ freezes far more often than is acceptable. This has been a problem for a long time and doesnt seem to have been addressed in PA titans.  - Units have poor pathfinding and will get stuck behind hills and other scenery alot. Having to manually move your stuck troops around obstacles is infuriating. On multiple occasions i have discovered that my essential support units like ant- air and anti-orbital ground units have become backed up on there way to the front line and this has resulted in me losing massive swathes of my army needlessly. Titans are even worse and will hopelessly try to walk through solid cliffs and your own factorys.  - The round planets are disorientating and make it hard for you to keep track of where everything is.   If you can put up with these issues then perhaps you can find some enjoyment in the game. However i would reccomend purchasing it on sale      ",

See it as if it is the final release of PA.*  *This is not a personal opinion but an informative review of what this game have to offer and its quality.*  The game :  Planetary Annihilation is a RTS of large scale with thousens of units on a planetary scale. For the first time you can *Anihilate* planets in real time to humiliate youre opponent. You can desimate youre enemy in many ways; Nuclear missiles, massive army of bots, build teleports to sneak behind their defence lines, blast a moon into theire home planet or ultimately annihilate the planet with a *death star* Unfortunately most of the time the game end before you can build such super weapons.  Gameplay :  It is classic RTS. You build a base, gather ressources; energy and matter, build an army and fight. You will have land vehicles, Bots, air units, ships, orbital units and Titans. All class with their unique abilities like: anti tank, anti air or both... You will have to make a good balance of all to succeed.  Multiplayer :  Multiplayer in PA is unique. You can make youre own custom planetary system and try endless of possibilities. There is a nice matchmaking for 1vs1 for quick battles. There is no custom setup as of disabling some unit or tech for now.  Singleplayer :  The galactic conquest offer a different gameplay compared to the regular skirmish or multiplayer. You start with basic tech *less unit* and as you conquer more systems you will get more unit/tech. There is no factions or story in the game but there is a background story in the conquest.  Score:  Gameplay: 5/10 +large scale battles -No factions Multiplayer: 8/10 +Many choice of strategy Singleplayer: 1/10 -No story Overall: 5/10 The game is unfinished, need many improvements and have no immertion. You come in and you are a commander and must to annihilate all other commander for unknown reasons. On the other hand the competitive multiplayer is something realy interesting if you have realy good hardware and good internet.      ",

A great map editor Large modding community  A cinematic camera In game rewind (you can view what you may have missed) Has LAN multiplayer You can setup your own server (and many more)  Cons: Large battles consume more mem (duh) but causes lag Small community  Only one default faction No single player campaign Some bugs still exist.   11/10 would destory another planet.",

If you want your units to be able to kill anything at all, you have to micro the crap out of them. If you don't do this, your units will continually attempt to walk/drive into walls and/or other terrain features. This makes me absolutely livid. The units are already ridiculously slow, why does an army of 20 T2 tanks have to be stupid enough to lose to 3 T1 tanks if you leave them alone? Ridiculous.",

Even though I haven't seen all the content in the game yet I'm sure I will enjoy this game for a long time.Some requests/ideas to the devs if they see this: can we have giant planitary energy shields of some kind that block big enemy ships (eg omega and helios) from entering orbital height until they destroy the shield with their firepower (and maybe stop orbital structures being built?). This of course would cost lots of power and would be expencive to build but it could work. Also, some regular energy shield projector/generator (who's shield can be destroyed) to absorb damge and prevent long range artilery from having free reign of desruction on enemy bases.",

I am not a milk drinker who expects every small deveper to produce perfectly optimized gameplay and a compelling story. I will admit that the AI are a little braindead but from what I can readily see this game was intended to be an online multiplayer RTS and the AI were mainly intended for skrmishes to warm players up to palying the game. $40 is a bit steep for the game I feel, but I don't ever usually buy games on steam for full price. A reasonable bargain will find you eventually if you keep a lookout for it. All in all for an indie developed game I think it is quite well done and runs quite smoothly and makes for a not-too-long matched or an overly fast paced crapshoot RTS. +1",

I've played a lot of Galactic Warfare in the original version as well as many multiplayer matches, and the content from this expansion pack add units that are capable of ending longstanding stalemates. As seen in the trailer, the point of this expansion grants the user to create massive units with incredible abilities each unique to a different situation.  For a pretty penny, this is a version of Planetary Annihilation that includes:      Three land based Titans (attacks land &amp; air &amp; water)     One Orbital Titan (attacks all)     One air based Titan (attacks land &amp; air &amp; water)     Misc. troops including an air unit that produces solar energy.     Adds to Orbital Tech   So basically,   WHAT YOU'RE MISSING IF YOU BUY PLAIN PLANETARY ANNIHILATION     Spoilers           2/3 of the land titans available to construct are slow, yet powerful. They can change the tide of any battle however are slower than molasses.     The third land titan available is a doomsday device that is buildable on any planet and upon completion will pulverize the planet it sits on.     The air titan is the same as the land titans, however faster but deals less damage.     The orbital titan that's available attacks all units, and can be linked to a teleporter and serves to instantly teleport to the surface of any planet.     The misc. units that have been added to the game include a sub commander that can build advanced structures at a faster speed.     Many combat units have been added in all fields (air &amp; land &amp; water &amp; orbital), too many to be specific.       Definitely worth the buy, or the wait for it to go on sale. I've enjoyed the time I've spent so far on it (one complete Galactic War) and look forward to the hours to come.  ",

You have a commander with which you build factories that build combat units. Send those to kill the opponents commander and protect yours, last man standing wins! Unlike PA classic, PA Titans includes the (spoiler!) Titan class of robot. Giant machines with unique attacks, massive armor and deal more damage than a nuke. I wish the different commanders had different abilities or there were factions to choose from with unique units. Or that you could use enough nukes to create craters in the surface of a planet. But those small gripes aside, the game is great.  Destroy the enemy by forcing planets to alter orbit, with planets that shoot lasers, by overwhelming nuclear destruction, or massive fleets of robots.   Controls - Fairly standard for RTS games Graphics - While zoomed out they're nothing impressive, zoomed fully in you can see decent detail, but it's difficult to play the game while in so close. They aren't fantastic graphics, so you aren't missing much.  Gameplay - Don't expect much of a story.

            "review_text": " WHOA DUDE!  It's a ♥♥♥♥ing RTS on multiple spheres. ♥♥♥♥!  Oh hey, this is more like what PA was intended to be. Download the Legion Expansion ASAP too. It's free and brings PA to the level of TA.  Comparatively:  Stock Faction/MLA: Agressive early expansion, mass numbers of units, constant torrential stream of units to overwhelm the enemy. Steep Learn Curve.  Legion: Economy focused, slower than MLA, but makes up with it in raw power. Due to this, unit comp is key. Soft Learn Curve.  Uber Entertainment's had some problems in the past... But they have added mod support. Prehaps they are turning around? The game is ridiculous fun if you're willing to sit down and learn to play it. Don't worry about winning- worry about keeping your commander alive. Your first victorys should be accidental from playing around with unit compositions, build orders, and commands. Some tips are:  ALWAYS BUILD A FACTORY FIRST: I know, it's tempting, it makes sense, you probably even do it from impulse from C&amp;C, but your commander (nicknamed COM, COMMIE, etc.) has enough power and metal generation to support 1 factory. Build this first, then build the MEtal eXtractor (nicknamed 'MEX') and power plant. Which one you build first may depend on faction, as Legion has a greater reliance on Power:  MLA: Factory - Mex - Power Plant  Legion: Factory - Power Plant - Mex  YOUR ENEMY WILL NOT WAIT FOR YOU, WHY WAIT FOR HIM? HARRASS, HARRASS, HARRASS. You have to make the enemy play by your rules. Either by mass numbers of MLA, or the proper mix of units as Legion.  DEFENSES ARE GREAT. OVER-RELIANCE ON DEFENSE NOT SO MUCH. The reason you want to also build your factories first is so you can build your army. The reason you want to build your army is so that you can move in your forces to expand your territory. Defenses are great if you've got the right defenses, but if you don't have any units to make up for their immobility and limited range, well, your enemy won't even break a sweat.  DO NOT LEAVE A GAME AFTER YOU ARE ELIMINATED. Watch the chronocam footage. This will give you a good idea of what else was going on in the round. Watch what your enemy is doing, especially the one who eliminated you, and eliminated him, and so on. However, also watch those who were eliminated before you.  LEARN YOUR ADVANCED COMMANDS. Shift is a considerable modifier to how things function- rather than click all over the place, you can drag and drop to build a line of factories. This becomes critical when you know how to do this in a flash- as many players will simply drag-and-drop lines of powerplants, as it's a quick and easy way to deal with your power.  RADIAL COMMANDS. These are sort of like the above, but it goes without saying, a base with AA units patrolling it is better than a base with static AA units. Mainly because they'll snag something even before you are aware of it, some times.  PROTECT AND HEAL YOUR COMMANDER AT ALL COSTS. You lose your commander, you're out of the game. Using your commander to help make a push towards an enemy base is a risky tactic, but for those willing to pull it off... Your commander, unless you are confident, should remain firmly planted behind your absolute fortress.  KNOW PROPER EXPANSION. You may be tempted to expand nearby, This can be helpful, but sometimes it's best to build up an army and take that far expansion point. Conversively, it's also a risky move to go for a resource pool with low room, but high metal, meanwhile it is not economically wise to go for the smaller pool, but it may help you build even more units.  MORE IS MORE. Build more. Capture more. Reclaim more. Scout more. You are never doing 'enough' in this game.  THE BEST MODE TO TRAIN IS IN 10 PLAYER FFA, SO KNOW YOUR TARGETS, SCOUT FOR THE COMMANDERS THAT APPEAR TO BE SIMILAR TO YOU: If you're a newer player, chances are you probably shouldn't try to pick on the bigger boys. Infact, consider yourself an ant, and them the boot. Instead, try to scout out- whilst still avoiding enemy contact until you find a good target, then look for a safer spot nearby them out of the way of the enemy players.  CONSIDER YOUR ENGINEER YOUR CAPTURER, AND THE MEXES THE CONTROL POINTS. Setting your engineer onto every node is tedious- instead, try setting them to radial build extractors on the whole planet, and then send units to support them.  KNOW TARGET PRIORITIZATION. These are very crucial things to know- If you have a large air force, and your enemy has anti-air supporting their army's forces,manually target the AA units first. Chances are your enemy will not be doing the same.  DO NOT ATTACK FROM ONE DIRECTION. This makes you very easy to counter.  FIDDLE WITH POLE-LOCK. This helps quite a few players, but playing with pole-lock may help your mind grasp the playing field is a sphere. This is something never done in RTS games before. When you're ready, disable it, and press N to orient yourself to the north pole, placing the planet in an upright position again.  YOUR ENGINEERS/FABBERS ARE ALSO HARVESTERS. Ever see all that wreckage laying around? All those rocks and trees? Even if you don't it doesn't hurt to set some engineers to patrol. In general, your fabbers/engineers are the workhorse of your army.   LOCK DOWN THE GAS GIANTS. These are incredibly valuable balls of INFINITE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ RESOURCES HOLY DAMN.  DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE TELEPORTERS: You don't have to use them to just invade between planets. Imagine the pants-browning when you set up an army to use a gate just behind your front-lines, constantly re-inforcing your troops. That's going to make a commander sweat.  KEEP THE PRESSURE ON YOUR ENEMY. Part of the concept of RTS games is pressuring your opponent until he can no longer fight. This means that you need to know when to group up your forces for large attacks, or set up your factories to churn out endless streams of units set on rally points.  USE WAYPOINTS. Use waypoints. Use waypoints. Use waypoints. Use waypoints. Use ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ waypoints. They will let you queue up multiple commands in order.  DO NOT BE DECEIVED BY THE POSSIBILTIY OF CONTROLLING THE GAME WITH ONLY YOUR MOUSE. The RTS genre is to be played with both keyboard and mouse, it is very deceptive in this regards, as you -can- play with only mouse, but it is exceptionally hard.  LOVE YOUR PINGS: Click those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ alerts up at the top. You'll be glad you did. Ping things of note to your allies with G and click. Know of sightings of enemy commanders, so you can swoop in and snipe them with your bombers.  GET RIGHT UP ON IN THERE. Using Ctrl-M and a series of diffrent controls, you can get some pretty good camera angles- Try watching the game again, exept from the ground. You thought that orbital battle was something before? Try it from the same damned level. Hold middle mouse to change where you're looking, WSAD to move around, and Shift to move faster, however you cannot change elevation mid-cinematic camera to my awareness, which is annoying.  All in all, PA:Legion is essentially saving Planetary Annihilation, especially for those who got gypped by uber not properly upgrading them to Titans, however, titans and legion are usually played together, so prehaps some PA vanilla core practice would not hurt, abeit legion plays diffrently.  All in all:  10/10, one of the great RTS games out there. I would sit and watch armies fight for hours as planets collided in the backround, machines so careless of these planets. lasers flying around, planets blowing up. I do miss the terrain deformation, however. If Uber runs alongside with Legion, they may be able to repair their reputation. Who knows?  Give it a shot, and remember, your first victories should never try to be a direct commander elimination. You should merely be trying to accustomize yourself with the game and eliminate somebody by more accident- or when the opportunity specifically presents itself. It's always better to kill another player in the most experimental and flashy ways.",

Galactic war mode (PvE) matches usually take 15-20 minutes per system, with a selectable number of system from about a dozen to 40ish. Smaller galaxies are usually harder as you will have to face the final bosses with far fewer number and variety of upgrades. That said if you are trying to unlock the loadouts without cheating smaller galaxies give you more shots at the RNG.  One thing I do not like is they charge $5-10 USD for commander skins.

Differences between TA and PA: PA has better balance TA has a second faction without mods PA has a massive modding community which fixes some of the short comings of the game PA has planets, not maps.  Pros: -runs on my laptop running an i5-2550, even with other players in the game. -System creation allows for some hilarious maps. -AI isn't 100% garbage at low levels. They actually attack things and build higher tier stuff on easy. -The modding community is not half bad.  -Unit balance is almost perfect -Titans are amazing and pretty much end the game(except fot the orbital unit which is just useless by itself) in most cases. -destroying planets is ore entertaining than you'd think  Cons: -The game is basically online only, while you can play it offline it runs like a spoiled mule. While this doesn't affect most people, this affects me negatively since I tend to play games at places without wifi a lot like my job(it has wifi but they track steam on it, before you ask I work IT and I might get one or two calls a day that I actually have to leave my office for, most of the time they just turned off the computer.) -Can be tricky to learn how to play. -Once again the learning curve. -Titans(except for the orbital titan which is next to useless) basically end the game right then there in most cases. -Tier 1 units seem a little weak as a single tier 2 can destroy droves of them. -Controls can be difficult and requires more micromanaging than starcraft in some situations. -Anti-nukes can only hold 3 rounds at a time.",

There are plenty of ease of use features that make the large scale of PA a doable task. Team games can be played in a 'shared army' format meaning all members share the same units and resources. You can queue up countless orders. Area commands quite potentially could redefine the genre.

PA Titans had a timed 66% discount for those that had PA before Titans release, and considering PA Classic is built into Titans this gets us a dlc/expansion with price tag everywhere from 10 to 14$  Discount is timed due to STEAM and their weird discount system, imagine a 35% sale going on with everyone that had PA before and their 66% discount added in, what does this give? 101% discount, contrary to popular opinion this would make it unable to buy game at all, which doesnt matter because discount is timed for 2 months and HYPE is everywhere, it would take special kind of people to miss it   As for why it was released with its own store page, Classic PA taken down, and new players can only buy titans? its a rather radical move to minimalise community split as much as possible, its also here to delete all previous steam reviews and refresh opinion of the game (thats why its not addon nor upgrade) reason for that? ridiculous ammount of negative reviews that bash game for not having things like save and load, never ever updated to accomodate new patches, things like that spread misinformation like forest fire in australia after dry season and give game a bad name thats completely undeserved (im not even going to mention reviews that bash game for being on sphere, what the hell is this, flat earth society? how is that even an argument?!)  Its also evident how much titans add to the game, 5 titans, 3 air units, 3 naval units, 3 new vechicles, 3 bots, 3 oribitals and 1 building (theres also that drone that carriers spit out, which is controllable and hence new unit) do the math, how much does that give?! 21 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ units, all of those masterfully crafted and have their own roles and counters, to all those that its the same pa it was before, WRONG, game plays completely different and all classic strategies got thrown to the trash!  Considering its actualy ~12$ dlc it ads way more than 'big' industries tend to give, and dont give me starcraft as example, pa doesnt have factions, which is actualy a good thing, and uber never had money to get those in game anyway  People also tend to say that classic pa got abandoned and you need to buy titans to get bug fixes, i dont know if those people are inherent trolls or simply stupid but prehaps you missed a 1 GB WORTH OF UPDATE to classic PA, which contains new ui, remade alerts, massive ammount of polish and bug fixes, dozens of voice alerts and some units were remade in their behaviour, which means the only thing titans got that classic doesnt have is 21 units and multi level terrain, and im not sure of the latter  Similarly all future content patches are going to be distributed both to titans and classic, which may or may not mean that even when they add new units to the game classic will also get them, only sure exceptions are new titan units that can get to the game via patches (game lacks naval titan, supreme commander tempest anyone?)   Thing that angered people most obviously was giving titans for free to kickstarter backers, while i understand the sentiment, early access buyers were no less important, especialy that were was nearly 500k (contrast 45k number of backers) of them or even more, dont let those fools that say 'its your fault that you got 90$ alpha, nobody told you to do so and you could wait' get to your head, you were just as, if not more, important in shaping that game  But finances trump sentiments, because universe is a  ♥♥♥♥♥  harsh and uncaring place, and so giving everyone that got alpha for 90$ expansion for free would completely break uber finances, loss would be unnaceptable, not to mention giving it for free for those that got beta (extending it to gamma buyers would be complete and irreversible suicide)  Most reasonable would be giving expansion for free to cosmic edition backers (250$) but even that is debatable, personaly i would not give expansion for free for anyone but 1000$+ backers and raise discount to 70% (75% also could be a suicide, tot small ammount of money)  Thank you or not, spaceships, hovercraft, titans and multi level gameplay were never promised at all, not even in kickstarter  You may ask why uber ever needs money, why they bothered in releasing this expansion in the first place? surely they are shameless cashgrabs and im a fanboy you might say, well gues what, DEVS NEED TO EAT TOO, multiple times they admited that money is running short, what would be better, releasing titans or abandoning a PA year later or risk bankruptcy? if the latter is your answer then save yourself trouble and dont even bother replying, because thats just disgusting  And for those that have issues like crashes or things, go to uberforums and post your issue in support section, you would be suprised how helpfull they are  Final note to that weird cult of haters and other chaos heretics around that game, creating private accounts to buy PA, write a review, spend half a hour in game to create illusion you did something, and then refund it? thats lower than low, Shame on you",

After spending 16 hours between 2 days of playing the game, I find myself very sad.  First, lets go over my first impressions I had. I started a campaign, where you basically try and take over the galaxy, one solar system at a time, a great idea for a game mode I believe warhammer did first, but maybe someone else did it before them too.  My first game was the most horrible, not fun experience I have had with a game in years. I put the game on the normal difficulty which is recommended as it's auto-picked and it was not well balanced. The enemy never does ANYTHING. if a cat walked on your keyboard for an hour it would probably win somehow and I am not kidding or exagerating. I spent 1 hour afk, came back and the enemy still only had one single base of about 5 buildings. I had over 30 buildings from the TEN MINUTES I spent playing. Leaving the AI alone for an hour had no effect, he basically never expanded, never attacked me, never did anything.   I then put the game onto hard mode and tried again, it was a lot more fun, but sadly still.. too easy. The enemy never does full attacks against you, they can but VERY rarely. They usually just send 5 units to poke you which is literally just wasting units of theirs. I defeated a campaign on hard mode easily, then did one more and found the worst balance decision in this game by far.  There's a perk that allows you to have an AI partner, the issue is this partner is actually a god. I challenged the main base of a faction ,set up some turrets around myself then afk'd. My one ally beat all 3 enemies on his own. He is ridiculously OP to a stupid extent.  I then tried the game in the next difficulty and found the game is actually flawed, period. Everytime the game ended up giving me a match where there is two planets, the game can't end.  It's so much easier to defend than attack. Basically you end up each owning a planet, you have a planet and the enemy has a planet. The planets are both covered in anti nukes so you can't attack each other at all. You can send units with the launcher, but the launcher can only send incredibly pathetic and weak units. I tried building 10 which is a huge amount, but they literally died instantly. I then tried building around 30 nukes, I could then bypass the AI's anti nukes, but still they'd just.. rebuild fast enough..   I spent about 5 hours in a game like this and now I think I am just done with the game and forever will be.  This all mixed with that this game has horrible pathfinding, sometimes making units run in circles for ages or running back and forth a few times before actually going where they were told. Horrible balance on Vehicles compared to Air units or Bots, as vehicles are just clearly superior as they have more HP, more damage, more utility and only at the cost of speed. Compared to air which is so squishy it's horrid and bots which are fast, but so weak it's pointless against vehicles anyway. Navy has some very powerful units but ocean is so rare and such a gimmick that it's pointless. Not to mention, why would we make navy units WHEN WE CAN FLY. Just put rockets under the damned ship.",

From a satellite titan that can attack from space (and teleport), to the Ragnarok that annihilates the whole planet it's built on. Also a few land colossuses.  Over all I do believe this variation of Planetary Annihilation to be a worth while game. From a background of Total Annihilation the premise seems to be about right, even in lacking proper factions. What I mean by this is that there is not an 'ARM' or 'CORE' side you can take. While there are four different factions, all units under any are the same.  Some small bugs but nothing major or game breaking. Loading a large solar system in the loadout screen can take some time and my computer is what many would call 'stacked'. Still a massive improvement over the not Titans version. This one I will play for example, the other version; total disappointment.  Hope to see a sequel to this. Would be nice to see this moderately fun foundation of a game have more tacked onto it. Such as better textures and realistic planet explosions (not that this rendition looks bad or the explosions not epic). Maybe even a tech tree, more variation of unit types, more celestial objects, or even bring back the 'ARM' and 'CORE' and their hatred fulled by over 4000 years of conflict.",

While they were distracted with my Titans I was able to build halley engines on another planet and fly it into the enemy's planet, distroying them and winning the match. Good fun.",

            "review_text": "Until I see anyone else make a decent modern-day remake of Total Annihilation, Planetary Annihilation has my vote. Yes, there are issues (as you'll see by the plethora of reviewers here who claim Titans is a cash-grab). Let's not forget that TA in its day would've cost the same, or more, as Planetary Annihilation - it just so happens that PA needed the Kickstarter campaign, with the milestone promises and subsequent issues that come with it, whereas TA was created in a simplier time whereby the financial investment required to create such a game was far more forgiving. The base mechanics of this game are great - it's accurately reminiscent of Total Annihilation (TA) and expands on it well by extending its reach to interplanetary proportions (as the name implies). Since Early Access it's become very efficient in maximising system resources. I achieved High graphics settings on my $600 PC tonight, at a solid framerate, which is more than I can say for many games. There's something very humbling about watching a sunrise over my modest little planet as a new day dawns and casts rays over my fabrication bots, which reminds me that I ought to finish building the engines that'll thrust my modest little planet into my opponent's modest little planet and destroy practically everything in its way.. humbling indeed. As far as scale is concerned, that sentence should've summarised it for you - this game represents a war that begins on the ground, with a single unit, and can (and will) escalate to proportions that you may or may not be able to control.  I played a match of PA tonight and I enjoyed it. I'm an RTS enthusiast - I can't get enough of Supreme Commander, and often I'll load up TA in a virtual machine and try to re-live some of that excitement I had as a teenager with too much time on his hands. I'm extremely critical of RTS games for this reason - I've been playing them since I could identify the keys on a keyboard - so for me to return to this game speaks volumes for its adherence to the core fundamentals of a good RTS.  I feel a need to defend this game, because the most popular reviews seem to condemn the 'cash-grab' nature of the release. I ask those reviewers one simple question; if you promised PA in its full entirety, and it fell short because the sheer expectation from the fan base was so broad that you were obligated to deliver, wouldn't you do whatever was required to get those expectations met? Titans is a huge step toward exactly that, and despite its issues (which I'm sure will be resolved - Uber isn't EA, after all) this game will become everything the TA/Supreme Commander/RTS enthusiast fan base was hoping it would be.  TL;DR? Rome wasn't built in a day. Respect the numerous changes this massive game has gone through since Early Access, which is the stage in which I started playing this game. If you're new to this game, take the negative reviews with a grain of salt and give it a go; the worst that can happen is that you think it's crap and you can request a refund!",

Whilst not charting the same depth of Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance, PA: Titans brings with it a lot of key and interesting features.  The addition of 'these titans' is central. The Atlas, Zeus, Ares and Helios all have fantastic game buster qualities which can end stalemates and validate a lot of former 'unviable' strategies. Moreover, the addition of other units (Mobile Nuke, Locusts, Kaiju) add plenty of diversity to the later game.  WIth that in mind, there is still a lot of boredom to the early game. It's either Dox or Bolos, with very few maps (e.g. Lock with sparks) offering any availability to deviate from spamming these 2 units with an accompanying air force early game. Ranked 1v1 is still relatively boring and short most games, with very few available opportunities to use the full arsenal at your disposal.  However, in general you will find a much stronger game complete with fun orbital gameplay. The interplanetary selling point of this game is finally worthwhile and viable. Orbital play is now diversified with the addition of the Omega, Artemis and Helios.  I strongly recommend this game unless you are looking for a 100% pro game, in which case go check out Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance.",

            "review_text": "Hello possible commanders,  so I shall 'judge' this game. Judging is a personal thing, so here are my impressions:  We all hailed supreme commander. So very different units, so many commander upgrades. With expansions, some things became quite imbalanced if you rushed them. Scale and performance had always been an issue (I had no 1000 $ for a top notch gaming machine). Planetary Annihilation has all those units, but makes them available for all. Now it is up to you to crush your enemy with titans, flood him with mechs, bomb him to the ground, nuke him to death, crush him under the tires and chains of yourt tanks or eradicate the planet he dwells on (preferably you have a transport or 'warpgate' if you also happen to dwell on that planet) with an asteroid, a moon, or a planet-killer gun.  It also has: strategic flexibility  a factor of randomness (galactic war) balance: if the enemy has warships, you have a simple defense gun that mows the orbit free   Because I am a beta backer, I have no idea how many skins are for free, but they are mostly cosmetic. The available basic commanders have the same armament for free.  Then comes planetary annihilation. I was one of the beta buyers/testers. There were good days, there were sad days. There were bugs. Unfinished units. Planetary travel problems (you had no idea how to do it)... and so on.  Considering bugs (and with the AI): They fixed them, made it a funny yet sometimes hard game when the AI came killing you wit a super army. (Only one time an enemy subcommander marched directly onto my warships. The idea was good - they had no underwater defense. Problem - massive firepower and single target enemy. So not a real bug but you might think it was one.)  Planetary Annihilation: Titans has not disappointed me. Get it for the special offer price, it is totally worth it. If you like the genre and loved supreme commander - get it as well.    Some thoughts: Planetary scale - no other game has it. Warp in reinforcements? Why not fly them from another planet. Or deliver them via planet (not recommended) Nuclear missile - meh. Why not crush the enemy with an asteroid? Or two? We still have those tough 2d maps, her you get a whole solar system. As of yet, I have to discover any AI unfairness.  Concerning dlc, i have seen no such thing, just got some free commander skins. Or models.  Scouts are useful. Radar is useful. If you use them, it is very easy to find your enemy. On larger planets tough, it takes some time to find the opposition - because the radar has limited range.  Also, I have yet to play on a world that was covered to more than 40% with water.  As I play the game, i will update the review.  (UPDATE 1) Great game. Really funny moments, where i died in the campaign, yes, you can call it that, because I pressed the planetary ignition button. Stupid tough, because my escape ship was shot down and the teleport was on the target planet.  Compared to many other games, the 'galactic war' is a campaign. I call it that, read the information on each planet and enemy commander, and decide for yourself.  (UPDATE 2) Played some intergalactic Maps with aquatic planets. Works awesomely smooth. Water land transition is neatless and all working just fine. Teleporters are really useful and fun - even on a single planet when you want to install a beachhead infront of your enemies base because a mountan blocks his artillery. Orbital teleport titans are also really fantastic - invasion on a new level. You should shield the more valuable assault titan with 'replaceable' interstallar ships tough - 3 basic space defense buildings wreck your priceless armada in a second. Also, for the first time, used the planetkiller (metal planet with 5 catalyst units) on a moving planetary object. Really and imply epic. YOu even can deploy or move units off that rock or out of its orbit in mere seconds before the impact.",

Well as of August 29th, 2015, you can still get it for 13 bucks if you bought PA prior to the Titans rehash coming out. So with this 13 dollar price point in mind, my answer would be YES.  There are a couple reasons. First, the new content is pretty damn good. It's a pretty solid addition of units to the roster, and the Titans are very fun to use. In addition, this relaunch with a new expansion has yielded significantly more players online, and that is a huge plus in my opinion. The game also has some visual changes to the background and stars that look pretty great in my opinion.  Look, it's Steam. For 13 bucks you could get a whole new game or even slightly old AAA game during a sale. But I think 13 bucks is a good deal for the content you get here.   I'd also like to take this moment to address a common complaint. People often say 'Why should I spend more money for an unfinished game?'.  Well if you're unhappy with PA, don't bother getting this. Before Titan's launching, PA was considered done by Uber and many like myself. This expansion doesn't change the 'done-ness' factor of the game. It adds new units, a new game mode, some really good balancing, etc. This won't make the game feel anymore more or less done for people.  If you feel the game was unfinshed before Titans, I don't think Titans or anything else will satisfy your urge.  At 13 bucks for a buyer of PA, this game is a solid buy. For a completely new player for 40 bucks, you'll find a very interesting RTS with a unique mapping system and all sorts of quirks.   In either of the above cases, I would recommend getting PA. Uber has ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off a lot of people in the past, for completely vaild and not so valid reasons, but I think this relaunch of sorts is well executed.   ",

            "review_text": "I paid $40 for this game. I didn't get the previous game, and didn't kickstart Planetary Annihilation, and never played Total Annihilation or SupCom or SupCom2. My most similar game to PA is 'AI War', which has a similar economy but more tech, way more turrets, and per-unit pop limits.  PA is unlike most other RTSes in many ways: you can zoom all the way out to a solar system view, with multiple orbital bodies that are all useful. You have picture-in-picture. You can give factories not just a waypoint for newly built units but also actions ('patrol this area; patrol the entire planet; go through this teleporter; assist this unit'), and put them on continuous build. You lose when your commander dies rather than when all of your structures die, and your commander can build and fight and move (and move underwater, and fire a super weapon with AoE, and fire guided missiles at aircraft). You have no 'supply' to limit the number of units you can have. Resources are not exhausted. There are no factions except in the storyline (or vignetteline since the only narrative appeal are the amusing backstories about the various commanders). Units have (wildly) varying sight ranges and moving-while-firing is the norm. You can achieve sea, air, and space dominance. You can reclaim the metal left by your own and your enemy's wrecks on the batlefield. You can build a conga-line of Manhattans (slow moving groundbourne nukes that explode on death), have one die, and then watch the chain reaction of explosions reach all the way back to your base and kill your commander. You can design solar systems with a time limit: in ten minutes, the only two planets will smash into each other, so either prevent that or win the game by then. There are 'bad spawns', 'good spawns', and 'godly spawns'. There are spawns which encourage you to develop one way or another - for example, if you spawn on an island in a big ocean, you might want a navy. There are spawns which are relatively easily fortified, with ramps that you can wall off.  PA is like other RTSes in many ways: you're playing from the word 'go', balancing early econ with early defenses and combat ability. You can rush, be rushed, and can defend against rushes. You can scout, see that the other guy has gone straight to building a Tech 2 structure, and can either match him with your own greedy construction or can punish his greed by sending an early, Tech 1 attack force. You can try to contain an enemy, surrounding him with your forces and preventing him from expanding. You can attack an enemy's econ and try to starve him out. You can see that your enemy has invested in a unit and, in response, focus production on a unit that fares well against it.  The real game seems to be multiplayer with a dozen players on multiple worlds. I'm still gearing up for that. There's also 1v1 ranked matches. I've played only one of those so far and quite enjoyed it. There are also AI skirmish matches and Galactic War. Galactic War seems to have a bad rap, but it's just a series of AI skirmish matches with limited tech, but also techs unique to this mode, like an AI ally, a tech that improves the combat capabilities of your commander, a tech that makes your vehicles twice as fast, and so on. On Normal, it is so easy that it's basically just an extended tutorial that lets you try different things out. I just wish that the unlock system were less random, so that you could more easily shake things up with different Commander loadouts. The most charming bit of Galactic War, again, are the Commander backstories. Such-and-such commander hears voices... probably because his brain was stitched together from the parts of five different enemy commanders. This other commander does this thing which 'is super annoying'.  I hope that Uber continue to develop PA. How about multiplayer with random Galactic War 'techs'? How about real factions? I hope that people get tired of 'reviewing' Titans based purely on unhappiness with Uber. Waah, why don't they work for free? Why don't I get a pony for paying $80 when Uber was promising that prices would lower, but that they only wanted the most invested players at the time? Why aren't Uber so much better devs that they could've made this game a year ago instead of more recently?  If you're looking for video of this game, check out 'MasterofRofleness' on Youtube.

I had high hopes, but played through the game twice. The first time was in Normal Mode and a normal size map - I wiped the floor with the AI in a very short time, no competition at all.  Fancying a real challenge (and I'm no ultra fingered leet kid, I'm middle ages with slow reactions) I set it to uber size map, Absurd hardness and ticked hardcore mode, meaning if I die once it's over. I slammed through planet after planet with an average of avout 5 minutes a map, just swarming tanks or bots. I'm actually very dissapointed (yup!) to not get my ♥♥♥♥ handed to me at least once.

I keep reading how PA was 'so far' from it's original vision, and that this is just a money grab. Go cry me a rivers boys. This project is pretty close to the initial pitch, I don't see how someone can claim otherwise. Sure it's not the best RTS containing everything anyone has ever wished for, but what the hell are people expecting?  If you liked PA but felt it need some bigger units, this is waiting for you.

Planetary Annhilation: Titans is a stand alone expansion which brings all new, never before promised changes that add a dash of exitment and newness to the well trodden moons and more recently, asteroids of its parent game, from battleships that hover overland to starshaped orbital monstrocities that teleport your units directly to the fray, orbital warships and a planet drill that says 'if I can't have this world no one can.' to my personal favorite the humble bot launcher - gun that shoots bots and is an ingenious if absurd defense. There are others of course; solar planes that add to the grid and lightning bots that use it up, super tanks and earthquake bots... Planetary Annihilation: Titans adds everything you never thought of - It's an injustice to say it's the complete edition, Titans is the cherry on top of a game that was already pretty good but somehow couldn't rise above the carryover from its overblown controversies.

The gameplay is no longer boring and repetative when it comes to winning. There are now so many ways to wipe out your nemisis, such as the conventional planet smashing or now, nuke bots, titans, nano bots and more. Gameplay has been increased dramaticly as there are (most likely) hastily assembled layers on planets which were so desperatly needed for the first game. All I can say about the new units are that they are awesome in every way. There is also a legitimate tutorial for new players consisting in actual gameplay. Overall I would say that it is a vast and much needed improvement that has succeeded in its Job. I have only found a few bugs such as occasionly when using a new defense (launches bots at the enemy) the bots may collide with a building and stay there standing sidaways. This is however easily fixed my moving them. The use of orbital has also become better as for the fabriacator being able to wipe out whole planets now just by building a fabricator. Also some fixes such as now when avengers are near an enemy they will not just sit there and do nothing but instead go and get into combat with them to defend your base. They have also fixed sandbox mode which makes for now, very fun and enjoyable gameplay.   I also neglected to mention that they have increased the AI in singleplayer so that they become more of a challenge rather than just the usual zerg rush. They will now try and destroy you with other means such as orbital or the new titans.   The only Major issue with this game I have found is that when creating orbital units they will often stack up so it looks like just one. This is not a major bug but is just annoying when you realise that those many hours of fabricating space junk has now come to one unit sitting there until it is attacked or moved, creating slight lagg when they all burst out next to each other depending on your PC.  Overall I would say that for people who already own Planetary Annihilation that they should by it if they want more of what is now a pretty good game. However for the average steam user I would not advise buying it at its full price. Wait until its on sale or Uber Entertainment lower the price! Happy gaming.  I would like to mentionI that I do not make descisions for Uber Entertainment I just play the game and review it.",

The Titans are, as shown in the trailer and screencaps, colossal units that can be quite devastating to your enemies, but require a lot of resources to build. Though there may be at least one Titan that isn't too useful-at least not on its own-which would be Helios, who sits in orbit and attacks things on the ground with some fairly decent laser cannons, Helios is more useful when it comes to securing certain locations such as the bases for Catalysts to build the Annihilaser.  I have encountered some issues with the game, however. Such as random crashing in the main menu and the game crashing when you try to load large systems, there may have been some minor things but I can't quite recall. I can also say that I wish the planets could be larger and more diverse in their climates, maybe even some life on them other than simply trees but that's something I can also live without.   With that said I can definitely recommend this game to new, moderate, and veteran RTS players. It's got some some minor irritants and some things I wish could be implemented but the good things about the game far outweigh the bad.",

I really appreaciate that they added the helios titan to make invasions possible, since in previous games if somebody had fortified a planet it would be nearly impossible to build a portal and get units through it before they destroyed it. One downside is that the units still have horrible pathfinding so you have to manually escort them to where you want them to go. I really like the addition of the doomsday titan, It's a great way to stop somebody from hitting you with a moon or the death laser. This game definatly improves upon some of the flaws that the previous game had.  If you are a fan of Planetary Annihilation you should definitely buy this while its on sale.",

Over all this version adds a couple of new units, and a new game style.  Cons: -no new buildings -EDIT:* Fixes have arrived! no more crashes. -strategy remains the same.   As you can see, the titans version of PA is not all that different from classic, the game requires a whopping 8 GB of ram and runs good as long as you dont have one thousand units meandering around. Some players have pointed out faults in my reasoning, sorry 'bout that, but i've decided to change my review to recommended because I cannot seem to stop playing it.  7.6/10",

PROS: The game is unique, it has spherical maps in a interplanetary scale warzone you have multiple ways to destroy your target, from the conventional unit  swarming, to nuclear missiles, planetary lasers, planetary collisions, and a new way to destroy your enemies... Titans  Now not to say this game itself just adds Titan units, it also adds new units, and  more mod capabilities, the titans themselves are great fun to play around with from  the rolling terror that is Ares, to the armageddon itself, Ragnarok.  The game is interesting in its own way, the thought of a rts in a new map style is already ground breaking, but there are cons and those are...    CONS : Servers - now we all suffer problems like these sometimes, but the servers are a major  issue for everyone, its laggy unless you have like 2gbps internet, then i envy you. But this game is really laggy at times that you see your troops in one area, and  obliterated in the other.  Another problem is optimisation, now this game looks simple, yet pretty, but for some reason even with around low units, it can get really problematic, you need a decent graphics card to just  avoid crashes, and a better one to handle the unlimited units, and you need alot of ram just to keep the game from dropping when the armies start rolling.  The game doesnt do anything to the units textures when zooming to orbital view, or even when viewing other planets.   So do i recommend this game? Yes. Absolutely  But i recommend getting it on sale and having a beefy computer when playing.",
