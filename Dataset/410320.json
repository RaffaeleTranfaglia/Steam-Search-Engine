If you want to compare it to something, mix Dynasty Warriors, Starship Troopers, Pacific Rim, and all the old Toho Godzilla franchise movies into a blender with a dash of Helldivers. The buildings are all destructable, all four classes are fun to play, and it gets really intense in co-op.   During one of the tunnel operations my team and I killed so many bugs we couldn't advance until their corpses started to de-spawn. The tunnel was packed floor to ceiling with a solid plug of corpses, and we could hear more of the enemy trying to dig through them.   10/10 would recommend again.",

There's not much story or lore to speak of, just you, up to 3 friends, and a bunch of crazy weapons that get crazier the more you play. My personal favorite is the Wing Diver's Laser Chainsaw, a close range laser sword that lives up to its name; it cuts through the hordes like a hot knife through butter. But no matter how strong the weapons might seem, the game is more than willing to one-up you with a new enemy or with hordes that make Dynasty Warriors armies look tiny (if you play a melee Fencer you won't be able to see your character on screen sometimes, just because of the jittering, writhing mounds of bugs--but when you swing your Vulcan Hammer and they all explode into clouds of juice, it feels *so good*.)   Note that while the game calls the Fencer the most difficult class to use, for my money it's got to be the Air Raider, who has almost no ability to directly attack and has to rely on sentry guns, stickybombs, and vehicles with weird, squirrely controls. But if just blasting your way through the game is too easy, you've got these advanced options to play with, and it's what keeps me coming back, trying to beat levels with unconventional weapons. EDF sets you a goal--destroy everything that moves before it kills you--and leaves the rest up to you. It's not open world, but in pure fun factor and 'did you see that???' moments it's up there with the likes of Just Cause 2 and Saints Row 3/4.",

EDF 4.1 is an over the top third person shooter (think Starship Troopers) where you can fly, jump like a maniac, drive tanks, helicopters, giant robots or armored suits in about 100 missions and 5 difficulty levels. There are tons of customization options for the 4 classes, whether you prefer to deal damage upfront with a shotgun or do it from a distance with a missile launcher is up to you. Either way, the game runs great for the most part and while it's not the prettiest out there, it does its job and you'll probably be too busy killing stuff to pay attention to the rest.  One last thing, I'd like to put an emphasis on the fact you can play in COOP. Playing all by yourself is kind of a letdown.  Join the EDF to save the mother earth from all the alien attacks!",

            "review_text": "DISCLAIMER: My review will be slighty biased as I have played the GDF/EDF series for a long time.  SPECS:(No fps drops or crashes so far and little to no bugs (no pun intended)) OS: Windows 7 Premium RAM: 32gb GPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 CPU: Intel i7-4790k @ 4.00 Ghz 4 cores  Oh boy, where do I begin? I guess I could start off with a little history before I get into the meat of the review. This series is what got me into gaming, so I guess you could say it was my childhood. You play as a soldier of the EDF or Earth Defense Force fighting an alien threat that came to Earth known as the Ravagers who are hell bent on wiping out humanity. I started playing at the time of Global/Earth Defense Force on the PS2 back in 2005. I had the time of my life and no game to this date has brought me as much mindless joy as this one has. This game is a Genocide Simulator in essence. Yes, it has a story but not one you would expect. Imagine how DOOM has a story, but they focus on the killing sprees of it. That same formula applies here but instead of an RPG-like world this is mission based. I sold my console a little after EDF 4 or EDF 2025 came out and am happy they brought it to PC! I have easily played 1000 hours on GDF 1, 2, and EDF 3 or EDF 2017 doing every difficulty and collecting every weapon.   This game here (EDF 4.1) is the definitive edition of EDF 4. It contains better fps, more missions, more content, and just overall smoother gameplay. The way you collect weaponry is by picking up weapon crates from enemies (same for armor/health). The higher the difficulty, the better the weapons you obtain to help you destroy the Ravagers. There are 5 difficulty levels and things can actually get intense. There are a total of 89 missions in Single Player and 98 in Multi-Player (EDF 3 only has 52 total). Even though the missions go by quickly sometimes, you would be surprised by how much time can fly when playing this. (At the time of typing I have 30hrs on record and have only gone through 33 missions, some are quick and others are long). There are a lot of people I have noticed that complain about the graphics and the reason it doesn't look as great as Star Wars Battlefront is because this series focuses on putting as many enemies against you as possible. That's their thing. Also, I for one think the art style is neat for the series. There are 4 classes total (see the branch/class trailer for that) and 800 weapons to collect (EDF 3 had 1 class and 171 weapons total), and so far it has been better than its precursor. This game is a little grindy but the amount of things and massive battles going on at once makes up for it, and to get the full experience you need to play with a full group in MP, it rocks, literally.  I am not seeing any fps issues nor in-game anomalies on my system. The PC port seems to be amazing in every major way. The only gripe I have with it is that in MP, there is no push to talk, so you hear others breathing through their mics, and if you turn off voice chat it turns text chat off too so it's kind of a downer. Hopefully it will get changed.  There is a LOT more coming to this game including new missions you can optionally purchase and before people say it never happened, one of the Sandloft guys on the forums said later on they would support mods sometime. For reference on that just go search up 'mods' on the discussion tab. This is really cool considering how this will be the first time EDF gets mod support and WE will get to experience it. No one knows how that will work so far so don't worry about it yet.  All in all, I may be biased since this was a big thing for me back then, but it is easily worth the price if you can stand a little repetitive gameplay from time to time. I HIGHLY recommend grouping up with others to get a more awesome time. That concludes my Earth Defense Force 4.1 review. If there is anything important I missed let me know so I can edit it in!",

Co-op works flawlessly, overlooking a bug that slows down the game while in equipment select (but is easily fixed by backing out of the room and reentering after a long play session) and there are no issues with unnatural lag or desync.  Highly recommended for playing with a partner or a group of friends up to 4 players, the reason following: Air Raider and Fencer classes in particular I feel benefit the most from playing with friends, having the most extreme strengths and weaknesses that are best rounded out with a friend than the other classes. The Wing Divers seem to be the strongest class to solo the game with, and so at first one might think you should go and do that, I feel like you miss most of the experience of the game while in the air; Coop'ing with friends as a Wing Diver actually leads to a uniquely fun situation where you get to be the shining savior for your friends on the ground as they struggling with the stages in the way they were intended.  In all cases, playing alone or playing with friends, I recommend playing on Hard difficulty for your first run. It is highly challenging, but is completely possible and the struggle is worth it.",

            "review_text": "I'll start this by saying that when it comes to video games, I'm a very transient person. Typically I'm the person that'll play a game for a couple dozen hours, drop it, and typically not pick it back up. A few games that have managed to hook me in the past/present were/are Counter Strike:Source, Diablo 2, Path of Exile, World of Tanks, Dragon's Dogma, Warframe (Pre-Pushover DE), Dungeon Siege 2, KOTOR, SWAT 4... And a couple more I can't remember. Long story short, it's very rare that a game grabs me and keeps me in, and I've played many hundreds of games over the years. Many very good games, too. Many games that claimed great replayability. But this one hits all the right notes in all the right ways, and I can firmly say is WORTH the hefty price tag. --------------- Now, let's get into an actual review. There are 4 classes for you to choose from: Ranger, Wing Diver, Air Raider, and Fencer. I'll say that Wing Diver is my least favorite class to play... But it's still a blast to play Wing Diver. Each class in this game has its niche and play style, and such a varied arsenal that you just want to play each class just to see what they can get. ----- Classes ----- Ranger is your standard foot-soldier type class, with a very variable arsenal, their weapon classes as such: Assault Rifles, Shotguns, Sniper Rifles, Rocket Launchers, Missile Launchers, Grenade Launchers, and other miscellaneous weapons/tools. This would including healing tools, flamethrowers, and other weapons that don't quite fit into the other categories. Ranger's specific attributes entail that he can jump, roll (through light obstacles), has the 2nd-place armor scaling, has two weapon slots, can pilot vehicles, and has the fastest normal recovery time to get up off the ground after being knocked down. ----- Wing Diver is the class I know the least about, but I still know enough to give a decent overview. Wing Diver has a flight-frame that runs on a power-pack that'll allow you to fly around at a good clip for a decent bit of time, however, a good deal of their weapons draw from the very same power pool, so one has to be mindful of their energy consumption. Their arsenal's theme is very high-tech weaponry, such as laser, electronic, and mind-guided missiles. Wing Divers have access to the following in their arsenal: Short-Range lasers, Mid-Range lasers, Mid-Range Electric, Particle Cannons, Sniping Weapons, Other Ranged Attacks (Such as plasma-bombers and grenades,) Homing Weapons, and other Special Weapons that don't fit in the rest. This class has weapons that can cover just about any range, but I'd say they're more-so specialized for Close Quarters and are proficient up to mid range, however they have powerful tools for long range as well. Their specific attributes are that they can fly, have the least armor scaling of the 4 classes, can use a bit of power to burn their thrusters and recover from a ragdoll knockup/knockdown, has two weapon slots, can NOT pilot vehicles, and probably some other stuff I don't know. ----- Air Raider, my personal favorite class, is the support class of this game. While he doesn't have much in the way of direct-attack, (being limited to 'Limpet Guns' which are basically remote-trigger grenade launchers,) He has access to a powerful arsenal of air/sea support and vehicles to draw from. Air Raider's arsenal goes as such: Guidance Equipment (Such as laser-designators for homing weapons,) Calling for Support, Support Equipment (Such as buffs, heals, and power-rechargers for Wing Divers,) Limpet Guns, Stationary Weapons (Such as C4, Sentry Guns, Claymores, AA Mines, etc,) and other Special Weapons such as razor-wire launchers, decoys, and electromagnetic shield systems. They also have an equipment slot for a vehicle of choice, which can range from tanks, to AFVs, to SPGs, to Helicopters, to Hard-Suits, to a giant rock'em-sock'em robot. Air-Raider's particular attributes are that they can pilot vehicles, have 3rd-place armor-scaling, and have laser-designator tools that grant/assist functionality of the other classes homing weapons. ----- Fencer has a super-heavy exo-suit which allows them to use heavy-weaponry, and at that, dual-wield them. It's also the most technical/skill demanding class of the game, having many mechanics and caveats. Their arsenal goes as such: CQB Striking weapons (Hammers, Swords, etc,) CQB Piercing weapons (Spears, auto-spears, etc,) Shields, Automatic Artillery, Artillery, and Missile Launchers. While they have the least weapon categories, don't let that fool you. What goes under 'Auto Arty/Arty' is a very diverse cast of weaponry, such as autocannons, gatling guns, heavy machine guns, cannon-shot, mortars, etc. Missile Launchers, while some of them are personally usable, the heavier ones are crew-served, requiring an Air Raider to designate targets to grant them functionality. Fencer is the only class that has access to shields, which are what makes them able to be tanky. Shields come in different flavors, such as ones that are focused on re-directing ranged attacks, focused on giving you wide-angle protection, focused on high damage-reduction, etc. Fencer's particular attributes are that they can carry two sets of two weapons, can bull-doze through obstacles, and have a very tricky to master ability to use the thrusters some weapons grant them to recover from knockdowns. Something important to bare in mind about Fencers, is that due to the heavy-weight of their ranged weaponry, they are very unweildy and have slow, dragged out aiming. Dual weilding ranged weapons amplifies this effect, making it very difficult to use them proficiently, but still very possible with practice. ----- Gameplay ----- I'll say that I'm only on mission 47 of the standard online campaign, but it's to my understanding that, DLC not-withstanding, there are... I believe 90+ missions, with 5 different difficulties, so there's PLENTY of game time and replayability to be had. This is a Third-Person shooter game, with an arcade-y feel, and a big focus on co-op gameplay, supporting sessions of up to 4 players, with a solo-mode as well. Enemy health scales with the amount of players ingame. Let me tell you, that the difficulties aren't just what you'd expect them to be. You actually need to come prepared with a respectable arsenal from the lower difficulties first. The higher the difficulty, the more health your enemies have, the more deadly their attacks (Both in damage dealt, and in functionality,) and the faster they are. This game does difficulty very well, and doesn't just give them more and more HP... It adds a progressively more challenging gameplay that requires you to be prepared, both as a player with skills and logistics, and with your classes' weaponry. The missions you play in vary, from wide-open mountains and/or fields, to cityscape, to underground tunnels and caves. It's to be noted that Air Raider's Support doesn't work underground, and only particular vehicles can be called in. This game has a way of really imersing you into the atmosphere; from the battle-banter of your NPC allies (A+ for having NPCs under your command singing along with you and responding to your emotes,) commander, and mission handler on the comms; really making you feel tiny as you behold your gigantic enemies, in the hundreds and hundreds that you're tasked with eradicating in each and every mission; and the way the lighting plays with the underground environments is something I have never seen in any other game before... It's both beautiful and distressing at the same time. --------------- I could go into details about some other junk that doesn't really matter, such as graphics, sound, controls, yadda yadda, but I'll simply say that this game does it all RIGHT. It hits all the right notes, and the controls perform exactly as you'd expect them to. All said and done, this game gets a resounding 10/10 from me.",

The classes all feels nice and different:  *The jack of all trade(Ranger) *An areial powerhouse(Wing Diver) *The King of air/artillery strikes and vehicle drops(Air Raider) *The heavy/melee weapons guy(Fencer)   These class work together nicely as well the one I like the most is the big ♥♥♥ missles the Fencer uses require the Air Raider's laser guidance system to fire for MASSIVE damage compared to what he can use solo. As you'd think you start out weak with low armor and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ guns, but as you collect weapon and armor crate drops from the enemies you get more health and better guns in a varitey of types, those allow you can handle more hardcore fights.   The best part is when you get your friends involved and play through the hectic battles as a squad leveling entire cities for the sake of humanity. Unfortunatly online mode seems to have connection issues that are a pain but a game restart seems to fix it, albeit temporarily.    The main issue this game has, aside from the connection issues online, is the price point. As 3 year old game 49.99$ plus the 24$ for the 2 mission packs (49 new missions together) is just way too steep so I recommend getting it on sale.   P.S Listen to the game when It says beat Normal before trying anything harder, you will be r.a.p.e.d",

To this day, I have a fear of giant ants and also Colonel Sanders, but that is a story for a different review.

The loot system feels limited, as you get a flood of new weapons when you can begin to manage finishing levels at the next difficulty setting; then you have a long stretch of getting no new weapons until the next difficulty setting is feasible.  100% completion seems to be having each mission completed with each character class (x4) at each difficulty level (x5). The Easy difficulty just seems like a waste of time in this regard.  Multiplayer is decent; and offers a chance to use character classes and weapons that look interesting/fun but aren't optimal in single player.

People who profess their undying love for it.  Having put several hundred hours in the series over the years, I am firmly in category two. It's a gamers game for sure. If your are looking for a game with involved technical mechanics and high production values, look elsewhere. One obvious glance at the game will tell you that the devs didn't put much effort into AAA production values, but the beauty of it is that they just don't care. What this game prioritizes and excels in is being fun. You have one goal for each stage, kill all the enemies, and you have free reign over how you need to do it. No checkpoints. No objectives. This often means unrelenting chaos and destruction as building debris and bug carcasses fly around all over you over loud explosions. Single player is good enough, but co-op'ing with friends, when you pull off a crazy plan to beat a hard stage you were struggling with on Inferno difficulty and everyone is ecstatic and laughing, that's some of the best co-op I've ever experienced in a video game. There's nothing else like it.  If that sounds like the vibe you can get into. Instant purchase.",

There is a reason this is hyped. I run around in a mech leveling a city to kill giant ants and spiders. Then I call in an air strike and blow up the next block.

            "review_text": "I am new to this game series, and it was a welcome refreshment. The style is super japanese, and reminds me of those old coin-op games. The sounds, the effects and gameplay is very arcade'ish. Can be a bit frustrating sometimes since skill alone is not enough on the hardest levels, and often you see death coming a mile away but there is nothing you can do about it if you are in the middle of a long reload sequence while you are walking away at the speed of a turtle while hordes of insects is flooding over you. This means you will need to grind a lot to collect enough armor and find the right gun for the job.   The many weapons and multiple choices for characters allows you to deploy a lot of different strategies to win, and although it is first of all an action game, your wits at strategy is what will determine wether you will win or not.  The graphics looks a bit old, but it makes up for it by a great physics engine allowing you to destroy almost anything, including huge buildings. The game gives you a grand feeling of scale and power, and the insects move around in a creepingly realistic way.  If you have a high end computer with a high resolution screen, you wont be able to take advantage of its full power. The graphics will be scaled up from a lower resolution and stretched to fill the screen (seems the highest real resolution is 1080p?). Only text will render in the native resolution. However, it is not a big deal since the textures are pretty low resolution anyway, and the blocky graphics kind of gives it even more that retro coin-op feel. I would appreciate if they added support for a higher resolution and better 21:9 aspect ratio support though.",

Sorry just was so I figured hey why not go online so I went online instantly joined a crimson inferno match they called me a noob xD but let me come with them anyways.  So we get in and I am an air raider I don't know what I am doing I throw down an artillary squad thinking its gonna spawn men up and 5 seconds later boom I fly sky high in the air dead cause I bombed myself xD they cleared mission and I ended making 3 new friends and got a lot of gear pretty quickly.  Now I've own the game for about a week and have put in over 60 hours into it needless to say I am addicted I only have 9% completion and still missing a few weapons but I don't get bored like ever I am so addicted to this sometimes it fun just to mess around and blow eachother up and do stupid stuff and its also fun taking on some levels on inferno that seem rediculously impossible like Brute force 31 I've cleared it once... and it was on hardest :( it is so brutal... and scorching mission 95 is also extremely brutal...   The game is a bit of a grind but sometimes it doesn't even really feel like a grind when you are just playing around and grouping up with buddies. In truth the game really is meant to be blade each class from easy &gt; inferno that way your gearing up as you get you completion but that is boring and truly grindy..

Stayed up until 4 am, was in tears laughing multiple times. The chat wheel is the cherry on top of this masterpiece of a game. We sang the entire EDF anthem across multiple missions with out soldiers singing every other verse.  At first the weapons seem pretty straight forward. The ranger gets realistic military weapons, the more sifi classes get sifi weapons. But then we started getting things like giant energy swords and practically shoulder mounted nukes for the fencer, triple rocket launchers and laser guns that shoot 900 bullets once you pull the trigger once, hand held mini nukes and lightning crossbows for the wing diver and giant spiders and attack helecopters for the air raider.  THEN we found a level we could beat on hard, pretty far into the game. Laser Chainsaws, 20m radius air strikes from 150mm cannons that recharge almost instantly if you kill something with it, acid squirtguns. Sadly I didnt find anything too whacky for the fencer, but it's already pretty out there when you dual weild massive artillery cannons.  The game starts off pretty simple. Go here and kill some giant ants. The difficulty and level design get pretty advanced pretty quickly. There's actually alot of enemies that you have to play very differently against. The level design is actually amazing. How much could you possibly do with giant ants? quite alot actually. My favoite level so far was just quite literally 3 anthills under some forcefields.  This game was my childhood a long time ago. Playing this game split screen on inferno trying to abuse all of the levels until we found a way to beat it was so fun. Now that I'm actually 'good' at video games (somewhat) I'd say I can actually beat them straight up. But I took one glimpse at harder and I was like 'How can you possibly beat this'.

Number systems on reviews aren't my style, but I've had a lot of good laughs in the game with my friends so far, and I've barely cracked the surface on harder modes.",

In all honesty though this a decent port with solid keyboard/mouse and controller support that runs at a stable 60 fps even with all the explosions onscreen. Not only does it include online multiplayer but it also has Split-Screen Coop. Not many games even include that as a future anymore even though we are in the *Next-Gen* of gaming. :\\   Cons are limited Graphics options other then Changing your resolution, Anti Aliasing, Anisotropic Filtering and Shadows. It does however support 21:9 Resolution and looks great on my Acer Predator Z35.  DLC is completely optional at the moment and most of it is just low level guns that are pretty much just for fun later in the game.   The Devs have stated they are looking into adding mod support which will be really interesting if achieved.   All in All this game is worth it for some mindless Insect killing fun!   EDF! EDF! EDF!

It also has no in-game chat system (Amended, there is a chat, but only if the host allows it. It's the 'Y' button) you can use; but it does use a voice wheel to get your point across. Using your arrow keys will open up a very large list of chat options you could use, but it's hard to navigate if you need to say that particular line pronto.  Graphically, it hasn't changed much from when I played it on the Xbox 360, and it runs awful, to be honest. I have a decent computer, and it's just not optimized with AMD builds in mind. I get an unstable 40 FPS that dips down to the 7s, and goes straight to the 60s.  Air Raider is best class, don't deny it. EDF!",

Repeatedly used models of a small number of enemy types used over and over again to create massive battles. Despite that, the gameplay is very addictive for those who enjoy the destruction and havoc during each mission. The game has a large assortment of weapons for each class, all of which need to be unlocked by playing progressively harder missions. This ends up being a very long grind to get the weapons you want, but the missions are such pure mayhem and chaos that while some missions might feel similar, varied level design keeps the gameplay fresh.  On the technical side, the port is very solid, though the keyboard controls feel VERY shoehorned in. They work, but not as well as a controller does, especially the fencer and air raider. These two classes have an abundance of weapons that need to be finely adjusted, but to give them weight, their aim is slow to move. This makes you FEEL as though you are aiming an enormous cannon, but while the controller just holds the stick upwards, the mouse has to continually move upwards, and most likely be picked up and placed lower on the mousepad to continue moving up.  Anyway, I'm ranting. Expect nothing more than the trailers, campy one-liners and scifi tropes included, but expect a nigh-endless amount (despite about 95 missions, online only missions included), especially with friends (limit is four).",

This is only a minor issue if your friends are unwilling to buy the game, unlike mine who need lots and lots of persuasion, as otherwise whatever you say to your mates in skype or discord, will be heard by pubs in game.  Apart from that minor issue, this game is honestly stupid fun. I first got into EDF with Insect Armageddon, notoriously a poor game in comparison but given that I was able to enjoy it, it meant that when EDF 4.1 came to PC I was blown away. The game is easiest to compare to musous just due to the sheer number of enemies on screen, but they play much differently. For one, the enemies on screen don't just go one at a time, it is a complete and utter cluster of pain.  The campaign took me around 36 hours to complete on hard with the Ranger class, and with the sheer combination of classes and difficulty that stacks up to hundreds of hours of gameplay, granted it will get grindy at points due to the nature of the game and it's mission types. The pain of the grind will easily be alleviated by going through on multiplayer if your able to play with your mates, or are fine with playing with pubs with either no chat or just not chatting with your mates while you play.",
