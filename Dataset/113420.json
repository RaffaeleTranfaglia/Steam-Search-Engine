            "review_text": "IMHO, this is one of the best and underrated MMOs I've player on my entire gaming life (20 years of gaming so far).  Why, you might ask me? I'll tell ya.   STORY:  The background story is amazing and it mixes Fallout series, Mad Max movies and also A Boy and His Dog references (if you ever saw this movie, you, sir, consider yourself lucky). The game has an unique atmosphere aswell. Not only a futurist set, but a post-apocalyptic one, finely made.    MAP:  The map is HUGE, I mean, HUGE (already tell ya that ♥♥♥♥ is huge?!). You could spent like 8-10 hours to cross the sectors on foot, if you make it alive.    CRAFTING:   Forget everything else about other's game crafting. This is THE ♥♥♥♥.   You can craft your own vehicles or train your own animals! Ride a mutant chicken or a horse (you can have many, many different kind of horses) or go in a bad ♥♥♥ mode on a bike.  You can craft almost everything, even tents, campsites and stuff like that to get temporary area buffs.  Craft armors, firearms, melee weapon, explosives, medicine, steroids, recipes, foods, drinks, mutagenics... the list is so big that probably I'd spend all the reviews talking about it.   Also, you need to craft ammunition for your weapons and gas, diesel or biodiesel for your vehicles, besides ration for your animals and repair kits for heal equipment damage from fights.   After all, even if it bothers some people, I must say that I LOVE the time required to crafting. Everything you make by crafting need proper time to get done, from just a few secs to hours or even weeks. A single tire for a car requires 8-12 hours.    COMBAT:  It's a partial FPS where you need to land your blows and aim to shot manually. No auto-target, which is great for PvP. Headshots cause a lot of extra fatal damage, rewarding you for your skill player.  The game have a lot of customization, meaning your character can max various skills to fulfill different roles on a party or even solo. You could be a mutant DPS or a healer, a gunslinger, a rifleman, sniper, fight with a big axe, two tires, be a sneaking rogue, a buffer/debuffer leader or pretty much anything.   PVP:   Awesome.  The game is partial-PvP. I mean, it's not a full PvP map, but, instead, we have PvP zones. On these zones, players need to fight over rare resources like petroleum! People can build settlements and siege-like stuff aswell.  The game has 6 factions which the player can join. Each one has it's owns charateristics, RP-related and PvP gear. These factions are at war/alliance relationships with each other.  The game also have a lot of player's guilds and alliances and people Pvping over resource nodes and PvP zones.   MORE PROS (MORE AWESOME IN YOUR AWESOMENESS):  - Not just more of the same. It really brings something NEW and FRESH to MMO players looking for something special. - F2P (doesn't matter to me, but it's nice to try for free if you're not sure about it). - Buy, craft and dye clothes and use them over your regular armor on cosmetic slots. You can even paint and customize your car, bike, etc. - Active, nice and helpful GMs; 24/7 on chat. - A LOT OF DANCE MOVES, including MJ and the awesome Carlton Banks dance (Alfonso to his close friends). - A LOT of creative skills that you don't see everyday.  - Welcoming and active community (don't let the Steam numbers fool you, cause the most people playing it are using the non-Steam client).  - Deep and beautiful scenarios. - Scary voiceover (turn it off, man). - You have a flashlight. - Immersion feel on every step you take. - Level up takes a long long time, giving you some sense of importance in the world. - Awesome PvP. - You can fight while riding or driving! Man, EVERY SINGLE MMO should have this. Drive fast while unloading a submachinegun clip on a pursuit, why not? Not a Fast &amp; Furious type? You can do the cowboy Texas style aswell and shoot you Colt Anaconda on the horseback. - You can have a dog! (anyone remember Dogmeat from Fallout 2?) - Different paces of walking/driving/riding. You can walk, jog or run and drive/ride at speed as you like. Not so fast, no so slow, the way you want.   CONS:  - One thing I dislike in this game is it's name. Should be called Awesome Earth. - Performance issues on some PCs. - 'Dated' graphics (I've player UO for 11 years, ask me if I give a dame for graphics?!) - 'Hardcore', even not having a full loot system like Darkfall, Ultima Online and Mortal Online (love them all). What makes this game 'hardcore' for some users is the fact that you need build and plan your character very carefully or it could be useless or disapointing at some point. - Unfriendly interface and learning curve.",

            "review_text": "World is not interesting, enemies are not interesting, dungeons are boring with bullet sponge bosses. The end game pvp is borderline pay2win with the way the shop works. The combat is aim/action based but still uses spammy hotkey skills. Overall the combat is worse than WoWs style due to how horrible the animation and unbalanced the skills are. The crafting takes a long time to do unless you pump money into the game. You can straight up buy the best vehicle in the game, and you have to buy a item to craft the best weapons. This is not fallout the mmo, this is a sad attempt to milk fallout fans.  I have a lot of time in it from pressure by friends to play it. Same reason WoW still has so many subs who don't actually like the game much, they play it as a social experience. Also have a lot of time simply from being AFK. The best way to level is waiting in a place called Citadel. Also crafting is only viable if you AFK in game next to a bought crafting table.",

            "review_text": "I'm recommending this, but not.  But why, you may ask? You have so much time in it, surely it's got something going for it?  It does. Thing is, the game is pretty much an excersize in unrealized potential. The environments look samey, until you go out of your way and find lovingly crafted areas people will never bother with.  The combat is clunky, if functional, and regularly gets screwed with by poor skill and item balancing.  The setting is actually surprisingly good, and there actually is an underlying story that you can play through at your own pace that is, shock and awe, actually pretty genuinely interesting, especially for your average scifi buff.  Noticing a theme? There are some wonderful ideas, but for whatever reason, they just never quite pushed them far enough. The game is sandbox-y enough to be impressively wide open, but they didn't quite cut away from MMO Theme Park syndrome.  The crafting system is amazingly wide, allowing you to make damn near everything in the game just from things you can get yourself, except for the necessary endgame things that require asinine boss grinding or broken pvp point grind.  Honestly it's getting depressing to talk about. It's one of those things that could have been flat out amazing, and for whatever reason, it just falls short. Still, it's the only modern MMO I've been able to stomach for any length of time, so there's that.",

There is no customer Support system.  You can send a 'Report' to the company, but, the same people who are the game 'Devs' will recieve it, reject your complaint, and then ask you to shell out more money for a Premium account.  This game was a complete waste of time, and some money.  The only good thing I found in this game was a Clan/Guild, that soon left the game due to Hackers, and the Devs that don't do anything about the Hackers, because they themselves are Hackers, and enjoy tormenting people in PvP with Invulnerable Characters, an are extremely abusive toward the Players.

Taking my interceptor for a spin and roaring past noobs on horses or swerving up and taking out some troll bullying noobs with the PVP setting on... Then the original developers sold it to the free to play people who started making drastic changes with minimal insight and ruined the whole thing. Then they built their F2P moneyfarm scheme on top and now you have the fallen earth mmorpg available to you today.",

Huge world to explore, somewhat interesting story, there's about 400 hrs of pve content, after that you'll ask yourself what's next? Well right now the answer is nothing, with population so low there's no pvp going on, which is actually really fun, even though hard to learn how to do it properly.   This game is not pay to win, I mean I really enjoyed game at first and bought steam package, I don't regret getting it, you can purchase subscription or buy tradeable premium for ingame currency, I bought a lof of them, I always had commander premium and it wasn't hard to earn enough game currency for it, there're multiple ways to make money in game, pve and pvp(but that's not the case now probably as population dropped heavily). I like the game so much that I would even pay for subscription anyway if not one but, and that's a big one, the G1, who bought the game doesn't develop it anymore, they keep 3 or 5 ppl on the staff and they do very little in game, it feels very abandoned. There's no anticheat and there's also ways to dupe in game, they can't fix that, even though some dupers sent them mail telling how to fix it, but they didn't do anything.  it's no longer an mmo, more like a bunch of ppl online, on top of that they downgraded their servers a few times, so there's much more lag, the content that G1 did is unfinished, and it's just a dead side of the map where nothing happens, they ruined the game and as long as they own it I can't recommend this game.

            "review_text": "It's addicting to play, I like the whole idea of building things to use in the game. I'm going to list the Cons first:  Cons: -Graphics are pretty basic, but the game it free -There are about a billion quests and you can only have so many on the active page so you can spend a lot of time wandering around doing quests and not realize you had two others you could have done while you were there. Now you have to go back where you just were to do those. -If you follow along the recommended quest lines, and skip the others in order to level up, you will be in over your head quickly. Not to mention some of the quest lines are 25 minute rides on a horse between them. -This can be a good thing or a bad thing, stands out bad to me, but respawns of enemies/creatures is WAY too fast. I understand that if there are a lot of people playing the same area with the same quests, you need to have respawns set faster in order for people not waiting so much, but this game has been out for a while and it's very rare to be questing near anyone else. If you are involved in clearing an area out and meet the boss, you retreat a little to reload/heal whatever and you will run into all the people you just killed and die in a horde. They really need to make some of the bigger quest jobs into their own instance without enemy/creature respawn. The game uses instances for some quests, they just need to do it more often, like the PRISON!!  Pros: -I find people are very helpful in help chat. I have seen the same question come up in less than 10 minutes from three different people and someone is willing to answer it all three times without being a smartass. -Lots of higher level players give things out to lower levels players which helps a lot in the leveling process. I got 50R from someone early in the game and can buy anything I want now at my level and I have a ton left over. Thanks dude! -It's fun gameplay,   As a final note, you can do surveys on the Fallen Earth website (not really, they redirect you to a company that handles it). These surveys can drive you insane. You can choose to do a 15 minute survey for a certain amount of points and then do 10 minutes of a 'pre' survey to determine that you are not a match for the 'real' survey and receive nothing. That needs to be fixed. I think when I initially started doing surveys for points, I spent two hours doing them, selected about 15 different surveys and only received credit for doing two. Not worth my time. You should at least get something for doing the 'pre' surveys even if you arent a match for the real one.  Anyways, fun game, kinda basic, surveys can be PITA.",

PvP is hard to get into. It's geared to favor those who have been playing for a long time rather than skill. PvM is buggy, enemies can melee you from a distance, kinda reminds me of SWG in that reguard.   This is one of those games that could have been really great. But its also one of those games where the devs listened to a fraction of the player base and now you have a bad game with hardly any players. Those players who are active consider themselves elite.   The devs have promised so much in the past, such as housing, better more meaningful crafting and gathering, BALANCED PvP. and over the years only minor bug fixes are what they give.

You use the awsd to walk like most other games, but insteas of using your mouse or trackpad to look a certain way, you have to use the arrows.. poorly designed. And to fight, or shoot. You have to click the middle button on your mouse to be able to go into 'Aim-mode'. To look down the sight of your gun, you have to hold B which is highly inconvenient. And the combat in the game is terrible, there's no blocking, nothing. You just walk up to an opponent and hold down the attack button and hope for the best. Overall, this game is like a 2-3 outta 10. I definitely understand why it's free, even then. I still don't recommend it to anyone. Terrible game.",

It has real genuine challenges, no bogus strings or restrictions you wouldnt expect. basically anything you want to do you can do it. it has hardcore elements that are in the player universe but are kept far enough away for the msot part that if you dont want to be a part of it you dont have to be.  only downside I can see is it needs a major overhual fairly soon. graphics and animations need to be redone and brought into 2015. if they did that this game would skyrocket to success no doubt about it",

This game is one of the best games ive played in a while. And yes i only have 5 hours into this game but so far it is a great game.   Weapons-There are a huge amount of weapons in fallen earth, weather its melee weapons like spiked bats or swords to guns like sniper rifles pistols and a bunch of other weapons.  Armor-There are a bunch of cloths and armor that you can get in the game which help protect yourself  Crafting-This is one of the big ones. There is alot of things to craft weather its crating ammo , weapons ,Armor , food , and a bunch of other things.  enemys-There are bunch of monsters and people that you will come across and kill. Theres bosses and alot of hard things to fight, but when you have the right gear and weapons some enemys will become easy to kill but there are alot of hard enemys that ly ahead.  Map-The map is giant! its broken up into sectors with different areas and biomes and you can come a across many things while you roam the land.  Friends-I like to play with friends this game is very fun with a group of friends and take out bosses , fortresses , etc...  PVP-Now i havent done or encountered this. but There are pvp areas all around the map huge areas to where you can kill other players build bases together raid peoples bases and have epic battles.  This is by far one of the best games ive ever played i give this 10/10  Hope to see you in the atomic wasteland! :)",

For those that wish to find a 'Fallout' experience, this is NOT it. I tried to get into it but I just couldn't. It is F2P, so by all means try it and I hope you enjoy it.   My favorite games throughout the years have been:  PC Diablo and Diablo 2 (The rest of the series sadly changed) Skyrim Series Final Fantasy Series Fallout Series  007 Goldeneye Counter Strike  Call of Duty Halo/Halo 2/Halo 3/Halo 5 (All other halo titles are the equivalent of Diablo 2 vs Diablo 3, im sure others would agree)  I hope a team of devs arrive with an endless budget and a total wow killer. I would like and would pay $60 for purchase and $5/month to $15/month for this.  Suspense (remember Resident Evil: Directors Cut?) Crafting  PVP separated from PVE (on same server, just a 'wasteland' area that is anything goes *high risk/high reward* A true shooter *halo/cod type controls* Eye Candy Graphix (computers are getting quite fast now, you can build a very decent server for a tenth of what it would of cost to perform the same just 4 years ago)  I suppose all you would have to do is get backed by Microsoft or Sony and make them sign on paper it will not release until it is polished enough for a very cheap or free beta. Once in beta, you have 1 year to make it bug/hacker free, then start adding content.  Do this and you will dominate the game market. ",

Microtransactions help a lot as well, almost too much. (Bigger inventory, etc.)   After spending about 8-10 hours leveling you will find things get very excessively difficult. I recall playing a TANK and having to heal after every fight despite having a leveling partner landing headshots over and over again. The name of the game becomes kiting and I was pretty much put in a spot where I felt useless. Once NPC's have guns, forget it unless you have a party. They don't miss. Ever.  The leveling system is stupid and punishes you for not knowing what you're doing at the start.  I would give the game a 6/10, I've for sure played worse. It has aged poorly, though. Wouldn't bother now. Much better choices out there.",

I HIGHLY recommend Fallen Earth for the compelling stories (even the side quests are pretty captivating at times), advanced crafting, and outstanding player base. Since you've heard rants already, I'll clear up things I feel the other comments got wrong instead:  - This is a post-apocolyptic RPG, but beyond that it has little in common with Fallout. The crafting in Fallen Earth is much more advanced and takes longer (days, sometimes). The V.A.T.S. combat system we know and love from Fallout is not used. Most importantly, the actual story is completely different. So if you want F2P Online Fallout, you're going to miss the mark a little.  - It is nearly impossible to 'accidentally wander into' a PVP zone. You will be warned if you approach one and the map marks it with a glaring red zone. In the off chance you're blind enough to wander into one, players above that zone's max level are excruciatingly penalized for being there. So don't worry, you aren'y likely to be killed by another player until you're ready.  - Admittedly, the game is hard to get used to without a guide. There's no sugar-coating it. You know what they say about learning to ride a bicycle, though.  - Finally, while this is just my personal opinion, I think it's hard to consider crafting a hassle when you can literally keep playing while you craft. That engine your building will continue its construction while you shoot blight wolves and collect scraps.   Enough from me, download and try it. I certainly didn't regret doing so. 9/10",

            "review_text": "This mmo gives off a feel of Borderlands and Ryzom (Another, older, mmo. Google it.) smashed together. Skill system: 6/10  Personally, I like the skill system, however, I feel like it's tied to the single currency of AP too much. You need AP to raise mutation levels, skills, tradeskills, and stats. (Which take 5 AP points to raise a stat by 1.) The game offers sub-level ups, so you gain 3 AP points per sub-level up, and it happens multiple times before you actually go from level 1 to level 2. You can get a lot of AP points this way but they all drain out by the time you're done spending them. The ability system can also be steep, for example. I wanted to do sonic manipulation and empathy for my mutations. However, both of which take 43-48 points in empathy or sonic manipulation to get the first skill. That's a bit tough. Now add in your skills and stats, and disregard tradeskills. It makes it difficult to pick and choose what you need. With all this stuff going on, you really need to know what you want to do with your skills before you spend any. Combat: 4/10  Average hotbar combat with left click as attack and right to activate a spell or use your second gun/weapon if you're dual wielding. Headshots do more damage, etc. You have your standard Health, Stamina, and Gamma (mana) at your disposal in combat. Nothing special here. Gameplay: 7/10  I found the world immersive and fun to explore. There's tons of places to explore, however the constant need of awareness of danger kept me on my toes. There's a lot to do, and it can get pretty hectic when you accidentally get into the nasty mess of 5v1 combat. If you like post-apocalyptic worlds like this one, I think you'll like this game. The game is completely classless, too, so you can customize what you want to do; ranging from crafting, to guns blazing, to a post-apocalyptic ninja, etc. The only other MMO I saw this done was in Ryzom. Technical Stuff: 5/10  If you're looking for a pretty game, don't bother with this one. The game is sorta old and you don't even need an overkill PC to play it. There are some graphical issues (for me anyways) but they are minor and shouldn't impact the gameplay much. Some of the scenery hitboxes are a bit larger than they should be, and on a rare occasion, you might see an enemy run through walls, but it's pretty a solid game from a technical standpoint.  Final Average Rating: 5.5/10  Other Comments: The game is best played with friends. I don't recommend playing solo.",

Most of the players are really friendly and willing to help! I do think that the tutorial should maybe be a little longer as i dont think that it really explains enough to understand the game when you enter the world. I also love the fact that you get to craft vehicles for transport. The fact that the map is sooooooooooooooooo big i mean its huge. AWESOME game. One of my FAVS!!!!!!

Edit: After 400 hours, and $200+ spent on this game I will say a few things, I haven't played for about a month but when I did, the server lag was so bad it was almost unplayable. One day the server had to have 3 restarts. If you make a clan/guild and take a break from the game, your ownership of the clan/guild will be taken away after a certain period of time of you not being on. If you don't like pvp then there's not much to do at end-game....The grinding is a big part of leveling in this game. If you do like pvp, well there's some good news and bad news the good news is: If you are at level 55 (the cap) and you want to fight lower levels you can, and you'll get a debuff so that it's more fair to the lower levels, the bad news it that the debuff is so extreme that a level 55 can be killed by a really low level in pvp areas. Don't be fooled by the tutorial, there is no voice acting while talking to people such as when they tell you what a quest is (NPCS and after tutorial) The 'built in voice chat' doesn't work either when there is a feature in the settings for it..another downside....

But, I expect games this immersive to have bugs, and I'm more about gameplay and less about graphics. If youre looking for a great MMORPG game this is it. The skill builds actually make sense, not like most games that give you the ability to max out all skills, this game makes you choose a specific build set to your play style. The crafting system is rich and really what i love about the game, Im always striving for better gear.   My advice. If you love crafting, skill building, tedious looting(i did say TEDIOUS) this is a great game. Play it. If you're not willing to atleast put 30-40 hours into the game before you make a decision on it, dont play it. This is a game for people of patience.

But if they did full voice acting for the intro mission, they should've stuck with voice acting for their NPCs in the actual main game.   It takes way too long to progress past the first map, if you don't play for too long you'll quickly fall behind your friends. I do enjoy it though, when I'm in town and interacting with other players. Role playing is fun! In fact, I run a clan, but there's another problem related to that. Because of the semi-good, mixed quality of this game, there isn't exactly a flood of new players. The community's population flounders, and other players rather shoot or run away from you than talk or join your party. I was going to give this game a recommendation but my mind changed after writing for awhile.  And the missions, the MAJORITY of the missions are the most basic of fetch and kill quests. Kill this many thing, collect this many thing, kill this many things then collect their stuff. The market is rigged, combat is cardboard, and missions overflow the queue.

Sure, this game is kind of fun - there is so much to do, plenty of quest, etc. but for some reason it didn't made me stay for longer than few hours. Maybe it's because I prefer MMO games in fantasy setting than post apocalyptic. Maybe one day I will be back and give it another chance but for now I say nope. It's free to play game so go ahead and try it yourself, maybe you spend more time playing Fallen Earth than I did.",

You get to craft items... don't want to ruin the surprise of what though.You complete quests all while trying to figure out your past!   *Update* I have begun playing this game again. While G1 did destroy some great elements of the game. This is still one heck of a game. I'm not one of those people who played this game for the PvP, I was one of those people playing by myself for the story and mainly just because I stunk at PvP :p The population of the game has died off tremendously, but the people in-game are helpful and kind. It's still a game to consider for a couple of pointless, fun hours. Heck, at the very least, download it. It's free, nothing to lose.",

Think Fallout vs Madmax and you are pretty near what the games is... but in my opinion it's got more Fallout to the flavour than Madmax, espeically when you see the Brotherhood of Steel clan running around RPing.  The world is huge, the quests are fun, and the crafting is 2nd to none. Crafting which is the benchmark of any MMO to date. Everything, well 99% of items are player made.  Play 1st person or 3rd person, live combat with head shots that have to be aimed and a full and exotic levelling of your character. Just a huge onion where layer upon layer you open.  But the emptyness of the world is so relaxing and cathatric, where hugh swathers of the map are exactly what a wasteland should be. NPC areas are rich of people and often where you'll see people and the live chat is still active for the endless questions for the game as it's depth is not reached just with the tutorial.  It's often it's depth which is so alluring, with the game systems opening up by discover and with the levelling being so statisfying, the only question you'll need to answer is do you have a free hour of your life to test out the game. As with free to play, what's there to loose, and what a discover of a forgotten game you'll find.  A rare gem in the grass, not quite a polished diamond, but nonetheless priceless in a market full of carbon copy fantasy MMOs, buy to win games and games that are instantanced.   Fallen earth is fully open world with no loading, and for that, mega props to the dev team. My hat goes off to you.",
