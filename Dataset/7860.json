            "review_text": " Once upon a time , Painkiller, Wolfenstein and Bioshock f*cked together and then Necrovision was born...   It's nice shooter with old school vibe  - bosses, big levels, lots of ammo, puzzles, switches, secret places, etc...  The visuals are not top notch, but fits well. The cutscenes and voice acting are TERRIBLE, there are many bugs and glitches, but the game is actualy fun to play and thats where it shines - the gameplay.  Nice mechanic is the use of melee combat (and shadohand on later stages), alongside with the pistol.  Once the player get the shadowhand, the gameplay is becoming closer to the Bioshock series, cause the different spells, combined with the tipical gun shooting. Controls are little different compared to the Bioshock though - left mouse button for the left hand, right mouse button for the right hand.  I said 'combined', so now is the time to mention the  COMBOOOS.  Our hero have three types of melee attacks - kick, left hand melee and gun melee attack. The bayonettas and the shovels can be thrown at the enemies to nail them on the wall, the gas lamps exept to light the way, can be used to burn the hordes of undeads and freaky creatures. The arsenal is impressive. It's good to perform different attacks to create combo. For example -  knock down the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on the ground and then finish him out with the pump. Or slice him with the bayonetta for the 'Herr Doktor' combo.   There are different  'challenge rooms' , which becomes avalible after beating any given level. The challenge rooms helps the player to permanently unlock different gear types to be avalible in the inventory. There are parts of the game when the player controls giant mech or even  ride a dragon . Yeah, the it's total mashup of many mechanics from different games (there is even bullet time system implemented in it), but it fun to play and it works...for the most of the time.   It's not AAA title, it screams 'I'M A CHEAP, LOW BUDGET, SOMETIMES UGLY GAME', but it's charming in some inexplicable way. So, try it!    7/10 ",

This game brought a whole new level to fps gaming that really impressed me. The story was very good with plenty of cutscenes which many games overlook. Also the FPS is so much fun if a tad on the easy side. Definitely don't play the game on easy. I also enjoyed the wondeful length of it with cool bosses and a weapon system that I fell in love with. The Shadow hand has now become on of my favorite weapons of all time! This was a game that was over underated as it is such a magnificent game! Though I will admit, it is a bit buggy at times but not enough to make unplayable. Definitely play this game and you'll love it just as much as I did! This game needs a new sequal with todays technology, it would be totally epic! So go know and play this game!",

Good gameplay, with graphixs that are good, and I must say crazy play times. *takes almost an hour to beat a chapter*. Has a good gameplay time and features a barrage of weapons to use. And a funny main character that is ridiculosly insane.  I'd give it 10 out of 11 deserves a Gas mask and a day off the field.",

            "review_text": "NecroVisioN is a first person shooter based in world war one with a twist, there is a necromancer creating hellspawns and zombies by the boat load. The game mechanics are old and somewhat clunky, but still work well and are easily adjusted to. The game provides several weapons and ways employ these weapons so that combat is exciting when a new weapon is found. The story is sub-par. The idea of the necromancer is somewhat absurd and steals the idea of nazi zombies from call of duty even thought I am sure that this game came before call of duty: world at war. In the beginning, the game frequently steals the camera from you and stops the action that this game is good at. When you do regain the controls, you feel as if you have shell shock and don't trully know what is happening. While you regain control quickly, it is still disconserting. With in NecroVisioN, there are collectables that tell you more of a story throught letters. But more importantly, there are 'vampire' collectables that allow you to activate a special power that slows time and increases your effectiveness. This power only comes from killing enemies in specific ways but the easier ones are the best backup for any situation. The voice acting is low at best, but still conveys the meaning behing the words. Over all, NecroVisioN is for the people who want to play a fun and exciting game that has its own niche in the gaming world and doesn't follow andy conventional methods.",

Can be literterly too, when you run you can melee and knock a group of badguys down!  If you can't played this one, get it. It's got to be one of the most fun shooters I've played in a while.",

A little rough around the edges, but it plays incredibly well, and though the graphics are the tiniest bit dated, it still looks very nice. I'm only a few levels in, but there's already a great variety of weapons and if the trailers/screenshots are anything to go by there's quite a few more.  Gameplay-wise, it straddles the line between older shooters (Duke 3D, Shadow Warrior) and the earlier Call of Duty games. Movement is slow and aiming is kinda janky- protip, don't aim down the sights unless you really have to- but the melee combos and the fairly quick weapon switching make combat really fun.  The term 'hidden gem' is a bit of a cliche, but it definitely applies here.",

Gameplay involves shoot and shoot against same enemies on lineal maps with boring backgrounds and insivisible walls, pushing levers to open the more o less hidden doors: that is all. The dark disturbs to aim even at middle distance; there are hideouts with items to expand combos and collectible posts little interesting. The story is typical, but the script is lousy, the characters phrases are more horribles than the plot and the cinamatics are disgusting by number and content. Only for nostalgics of this failed path of old school shootters, and young people attracted by discounts, but there are much better options, and older, for same or lower price.",
