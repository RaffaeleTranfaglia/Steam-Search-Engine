            "review_text": "Got the game on the Steam 4th of July Summer Sale for $1.24! GOOD GAME! haha  I was looking on steam for a fun time waster game because so many games are on sale, I didn't want the same boring old games that I always see, then I came across iGrow Game and thought it would be fun to play a game like this, so I got it not expecting much, but I'm surprised it's better than I thought!   The basic gameplay is good, it has a cool theme, standard first person controls. It runs really well @ 60fps, has unique graphics, and has some video setting in the menu to make it run better if your PC isnt that good. You can speed time up to make the plants grow faster, keep your basic needs up like sleep, eat, drink, and you have a cool apartment building to roam around in.  iGrow has 2 game mode settings, survival mode, or normal mode. In survival mode you have to Eat, drink, and sleep. The cops can also show up if you fail to meet your needs and they take EVERYTHING so you have to start from scratch. In normal mode you don't have to worry about any of that and can just grow at X10 speed and make huge XP and money.   iGrow has tons of upgrades and customizations for the rooms and equipment to help your plants grow as big and potent as they can so when you sell to the dealers located on different floors of the apartment you can get the most money and XP for your grows.  The music and sound effects are GREAT. iGrow as a whole is a great example of a chill game.  UPDATE 12/16/2016 iGrow just got an update that fixes some bugs, add's a new Christmas Gold strain, a new cross breeding feature that allows you to mix and match any unlocked strain to create a new strain, and also now you can level up to 50!  I look forward to see what the Dev has planned for updates to make it even better.",

            "review_text": "  So far from what I have played it is an enjoyable game and easy to follow, The level up system is balanced and there are lots of different strains to unlock as well. I gave this a positive review because, this is one of the very few cannabis growing games out there that is actually playable and not text based and two the Dev is actively interested in the community feedback and improving his game.   Now is the game perfect? No, but gameplay is smooth and I myself have not encountered any game crashes or glitches that have 'broken' the game.   When I do my reviews I feel it is important to remember that these games are EARLY ACCESS not completed $80 games! People put their games on steam (most do anyways) to gain access to more funds to improve the quality of the game and that is exactly what he is doing with this game. I am looking forward to seeing what changes and improvements are made.  For the price you can't go wrong!   I have seen improvements since I started playing on 4/20/16 &lt;&lt;&lt;--- I know classic right ;)  Hope this helps  Happy Growing!",
