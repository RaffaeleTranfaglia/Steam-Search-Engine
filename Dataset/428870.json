            "review_text": "This game, just as it was in Close Your Eyes, is all about perception. There is no right or wrong, no 'winning' or 'losing', depending on how you think of it. It's best to dive into the experience with an open mind, void of any pre-judgements or spoilers. When the seemingly innocuous nature of the game breaks, you'll know it, and nothing will ever be the same from that moment forward.   This game has a style all its own filled with surreal original artwork, gorgeous sound design, and fantastic writing. The puzzles are fun and the game has plenty of challenging moments, though some may push you to your limit of tolerance and beyond. I think, as gamers, we are used to being spoiled with arbitrary rewards and tutorials to hold our hands, so when a game like this appears--we're not sure what to think at first. There's a strange sense of voyeurism involved when you realize your protagonist is being punished and put through hell, but you can't help but continue on to the end. Just like CYE, don't expect a sense of satisfaction at the end, expect to have your thoughts and dreams haunted for days (and possibly weeks) after completion.   The developer has stated that they will most likely be getting into commercial gaming development in the future. Part of me would truly miss them in the indie horror world, but I am equally excited to see what they can accomplish with even more resources at their fingertips. As of now, I would happily place AestheticGamer aka Dust Golem in the same pantheon as Kikiyama, Deep Sea Prisoner, Sen and Fummy when it comes to the true greats of indie game-making.",

            "review_text": "I really enjoy AestheticGamer's approach to horror - and, without spoilers - some great satire on the current state of gaming in Take the Dream IX. I felt genuinely interested in the characters, and throughly enjoyed the different themes laced through the gameplay. Yes, this was a rougher, more experimental game, but I feel that sometimes those are the best! Nothing is gained without sometimes just throwing things at the wall until they stick, and the atmosphere and mood created a great sense of dread in certain points of the game that I found engrossing.   Addressing one of the elephants in the room: There is a particular section of the game that is a bit difficult. It took me about 8 - 10 attempts to clear it, and I could see people (myself included) raging a bit about it. I think I have very clear idea about what the creator was trying to do here, and it made especially more sense upon the next part of the game.   Let's just say, it's a satire of a particular style of game - one that tends to get a lot of coverage through certain social media channels. I tip my bonnet to you sir.  Anywho, overall a very unique and enjoyable horror / comedy / tragedy / satire experience. I will continue to look forward to future games by Yai Gameworks!",

This one is different - free, using other kind of sprites, which dialogues that person saying is marked with 'text background' color. Some puzzles, not actual fighting.  But still the way how this kind of games works pisses me off - because it's all making game slow. You want to switch position of something? You need to skip 3 texts, then choose one of 4 options. Great. Then make it couple times, cause you have couple things to change. It ain't fun. It's funnier when you step from one side and it turns into other. But no... that's definitely too hard to make. Ugh...  I tried to like this game.",
