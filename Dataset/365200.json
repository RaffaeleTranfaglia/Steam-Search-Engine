I would also like to say that this game is not clearly made for PC as in my opinion the game is made for mobile phones or tablets. Would I recommend this game for the mobile platform? Yes. But in PC I think not.  EDIT: I might recommend it if it had trading cards, more selection of artists and keyboard commands.",
