            "review_text": "I'd have to say that the concept behind this game is unique and really awesome. However, like many other negative reviews, the execution is lacking. I'd still recommend it, because I know that pulling this game off is extremely hard, and the devs did not fail terribly at doing so. They didn't pull it off great, just fine, but it's not game-wrecking either.  Hack 'n' Slash has a certain sense of novelty before you buy it. I mean, you gotta change that boolean value to open the door! How cool is that?! But after a while, the more complex puzzles kinda ticks you off with it's complexity. People who have no prior background knowledge or experience with programming will find this game impossible to complete, and will leave it hanging in their game library.  The game is largely unguided, so you can actually run off and get yourself into the wrong room/place before completing a certain task, or getting a certain artifact. The game takes the difficulty up a few scary notches late into the story, notably within the castle. I'm no elite programmer by any standards, and I find that giving the entire library of source code in the castle is a little overwhelming. I also did get lost a few times within the game, not knowing if I should proceed this way or that.  All in all, I'd say it's a good challenge for those even with a strong programming background. I'd recommend this game, but only if you know some basic computer programming beforehand.",

And by 'finished', I don't mean 'completed the game'…  I got all the way to Act 4, or the 'Tutorial', at which point the game expected me to modify increasingly complex graphical abstractions of Lua script. I am not a programer (not because I haven't ever tried), so this is the point where the game stopped being at all fun. I'm not saying that I couldn't possibly have figured it out and continued progressing, but…  I enjoyed what I played of this game, and don't regret purchasing it. However, I'm a bit disappointed that the game puts up such a brick wall, after what had been a fairly easy learning curve. I very quickly went from an 'I am smart' feeling to a 'this is the point where I fail to 'measure up'' feeling.",

            "review_text": "So first off, I was almost hesitant to buy this because of the negative reviews. Let me just say- I'm glad I bought it anyway!  I really did thoroughly enjoy this game- perhaps it was because I had read a lot of disclaimers, and was waiting for 'a letdown' but for me, such a letdown never occured.   I am a programmer (though I've never really delved into Lua specifically) so the obvious appeal of a 'hacking game' was at the core of my reason for purchasing. I am typically a 'whiner' when it comes to games (I set everything to easy, and try to 'hack' around the difficulty if I decide that a game is too difficult) so this game was awesome, because it certainly encouarged the hacking!  For the first part of the game, I found the 'hacking' of the entities kind of repetitive, and somewhat boring, but I pressed on. When I finally got to act 4 (where some many people start to see negatives)- I was extatic when I started to see real live code! Some have said it's not actual Lua source (I'm not sure- but it looks similar to source at any rate to me). I was really worried that it was going to be really difficult, but I found the puzzles intriguing. Some of the puzzles can be a bender (you start messing with something, and then you figure out the most obvious solution and it's like- 'Gee, why didn't I see that in the first place?' lol).     tl;dr Overall, I found the game highly enjoyable (low replay value, but that's not usually important to me in games- I conquer and move on). If you do any kind of intermediate coding (I HIGHLY stress that- you will need to have some kind of logic, math, or data structure training once you get to act 4) then you owe it to yourself to get this game and try it out!",

I received the game for free, so I really couldn't complain.  It starts off innocently enough and if anyone has played with game creators, you'll soon see what I mean. Editing rocks or doors to change their properties...etc. Simple enough stuff and when you've got the hang of it, no problem.  The only problem I have is about midway through the game when the real 'programming' kicks in. The learning curve becomes a cliff. The tutorials at using this new functionality (editing the base code on which the game is built) are easy compared to what you eventually need to do with it (although it's normally just editing a few variables...but finding them is the difficult part and as such led me to crashing the game numerous times, beyond the in game error handling)  I would recommend, especially if you picked it up for free. It's a fantastic idea that I'd like to see developed further and maybe easy people into the lua a bit more before drowning them in the pages of code.",

Although I will admit that some of the Cool Stuff started flying over my head.   The game won't teach you code, but it will  sort of  teach you  about  code. Sometimes cleverly and intuitively, sometimes a bit more hamhandedly. The game doesn't always quite work, but when it does, it's kinda magical. Definitely recommend this one.",

Act 2,3 were quite nice and interesting. Act 4,5 I found impossible to get through without a walkthrough for the most part.  Even if you're into coding, it just gets so very busy (like for 1 object, there could be 6 code groups, which also have another sub-code within each of them), and there's barely any clues as to which variable(s) out of all that code you should mess with. One wrong step, you can 'crash' your game, and have to restart the room. And later on, there's this huge place with dozens of code books, which like above, you'll have no idea what's important and what to edit.  Sometimes I would do something correctly, but still get an in-game crash, it just happens randomly (making me think I did something wrong and waste time trying other things), but other times, and unsure if just my computer (which is a nicely specced desktop), the game would freeze/crash, and I would have to end the process and restart the game entirely. Luckily it autosaves each time you go into a room. -------  Overall, it's a very unique game, with great ideas, just can get kind of confusing, but I'm sure some would enjoy it. Personally the frequency of real crashes and strange increase in coding difficulty were a bit off-putting, so I'm giving it a 6/10, but would still recommend it.",

Remove falling off platforms, change your own movespeed, break everything again and again until you find a way to break it that doesn't make the universe keel over. It's short, but I don't know if length would've improved it. The true coding of the game is bewildering at first, and remains half-indecipherable, but whole experience was enjoyable, with decent writing and art to round out the game's mechanics.

The whole concept is fun and would be awesome if it was applied well, but right now this game is just pretty poorly done. Sure, the graphics took some time, but they're nothing that drastically special. Other than that, most of the game actually seems pretty slapped together by the time you get through it.  Firstly, I am a really experienced programmer, at least for 7-8 years now. Obviously, I'm no amazing specialist, but I know waaaaaaay more than anything this game goes into. Even so, I thought it would be interesting. Turns out not.  The game has no difficulty as you're basically invincible from the beginning (which is possible through more than just 1 way). Even if you don't make yourself invincible, the fighting really isn't the focus and is pointless anyway.  What's more important is the coding and hacking, which is a flop. The majority of the puzzles require barely any thought, except for one or two which require no real thought in programming but more thought in understanding what in the world you're supposed to be going for. For the former, most puzzles simply require setting a value to X or changing a 'greater than' to a 'less than' and you're done. For the latter, I mean things like what are required from the Library at the endgame--some are easy, some are just unintuitive to even know what you're meant to edit.  Anyway, I beat the game in under 4 hours, probably closer to 3 hours as some of my gametime is spent with the game sitting up. For me, it was boring. For non-programmers, I feel like it would be a pain. The first couple of chapters would be fine, with some general understanding, but once you have non-programmers needing to delve 3+ levels into an object to find some function or variable, they're not really going to understand what this means anymore... they'll just sit with their game broken into 4 screens, confused.  Lastly, the whole story was boring and the dialogue was TERRIBLE. Oh man, I wanted to punch the screen so much, I kept skipping through more dialogue the further I was through the game. It was cheesily stupid to the point where it was annoying. I can deal with cheesiness and love overly-stupid humor, but this game's dialogue was just the worst.  Usually I don't come out this gritty about a game, but it's just not done well. I wanted this game to be great, especially from Double Fine, but nope. I've played many other Double Fine games on console before (and bought them again for the PC to play again), but I still stick by (as many others do) Psychonauts being their best.

I thought this game was right up my alley, being as I love programming, I love puzzles, and I love the Legend of Zelda-like look to it, but overall, this game was just completely underwhelming.   In general, the core mechanics of this game aren't all to great. Sure it seems cool looking at all the things that you can do, and all the possible puzzles, but nothing really feels very interesting. So many of the encounters you have are just the samet thing of dodging the enemy, reprogramming the enemy to something else, and repeat. It may seem pretty cool, and pretty limitless, but theres almost nothing interesting you can do. This game also looks like it has a lot of exploration to it, but it's really just extremely railroaded with the illusion of being truly open world. Its like 'Sure you could go this way, but it doesn't lead anywhere for you right now and you don't get any hint what you need or how to get it.' On top of this, the challenge in this game comes from the wrong place. It should be in the interesting combat which changes constantly, but it's extremely repetetive, and you can become practically invincible extremely early on. The real challenge is the puzzles and the feeling of 'Am I doing this right? I have no idea' and then going to the 'There has to be another way, or some hint' but being as it's very railroaded, there's no hints, and nothing else to do other than look up what to do online, and being completely underwhelmed by the solution. Just overall, this game was a tremendous disappointment for someone who wanted to love this game, and if you're on the fence about buying this, don't.  TL;DR: I would have loved this game, but I've only had experiences that are underwhelming, boring, repetetive, and just infuriating. Do not buy this game unless you want to just refund it.",

This game, as you will probably can tell, needs some experience with code in general, but LUA would be highly recommended that's what the game runs on. Now, I dont have tons of experience with coding, mainly only C, but, that's not the problem I have with this game. The game kinda spins this idea that you can change all the code how you need it to, but that's not really true. Each puzzle looks for a specific solution, or the world will crash (no, it will not crash your game, they were smart about that). And what I mean by that is that the code is filled with error checking, which makes sense in normal games, but with something like this where errors are kinda the objective, it feels limiting. But lets do a list, because people like those:   Pros",

Later, I saw it appeared on quite a few end-of-year top 10 lists from people whose opinion on games generally seemed similar to mine, so I got to thinking if maybe the coding elements just weren't for everyone. Since they totally are for me, I saw that it was on sale and took a chance.  Whoops.  Right from the get go, Hack 'n' Slash feels like a slapped together indie product. It is the sort of thing that would wow you if it were on Kongregate or some free flash site, but will immediately make you wonder about your fiscal prudence. Rather than put you through an interesting sequence of puzzles, Hack 'n' Slash dumps you unceremoniously into a Zelda like open world, but unlike a Zelda-like open world, there is absolutely no direction, nor rhyme, nor reason to what you're supposed to do. Worse still, the low production values extend to the gameplay as well; why do I have to scroll slowly through numerical values instead of just typing them in?  The aesthetic is beautiful, the animation is eye gougingly bad (presumably to allow for the fact that the player can speedit up), and the main character looks so stupid that it affected my enjoyment of the game. I futzed around hoping to encounter something interesting but that never happened. Even the title screen is amazingly unresponsive (it prompts you with just the word 'Enter', but you'll have to practically mash the return key before you actually get the result you want).  Don't buy Hack 'n' Slash.",

            "review_text": "I really wanted to like this game. I really did.  Disclaimer: I bought this as a full game, not as part of its early access program.  The art style is nicely done, intentionally evoking similarities between itself and Legend of Zelda. The music is pleasant. The writing in parts is great and amusing, as is the story and setting. The core concept of hacking / changing variables and code to progress or solve puzzles is unique as far as my experience goes, and you could see the idea helping teach some coding alongside game progression.  Disclaimer 2 - I don't have programming experience, although I do have a master's degree in chemical engineering. Neither of these two things should be prerequisites to enjoying a game.  The execution however leaves something to be desired. A number of the concepts in the game are really poorly explained and so you will quite often find yourself fumbling around having accidentally changed something you didn't need to or breaking a puzzle in such a way that it is very difficult to get back on track (assuming you're learning the coding logic as the game presents it to you, as I was). You will occasionally find yourself understanding the problem and having the solution, and yet being beaten back from it by often loose controls constantly sending you off the edge of tiny moving platforms. You'll see speech and conversation that reads as though it hasn't been proof-read and is missing punctuation and grammar (not important until you're relying on it to help you solve puzzles).  And then Act 4 happens, whereby you're set loose into a complex set of puzzles that are all but impossible to work around using the game's explanations. Note that they aren't impossible, and often the solution is relatively simple, but the point of this is that the solution is obfuscated by so much poorly presented information that unless you already understand the puzzle (i.e. can read the code logic) and have written it out (to figure out what variables and subloops are doing) you quickly find yourself giving up.  I gave in part way through this. Some games I enjoyed the experience so much that I persisted, or looked for solutions online to help me pass a sticky bit and enjoy the rest of it. This was very much like trudging through treacle.  Ultimately a missed opportunity, and a lesson in game development of why play testing and QA are important.  Give it a miss.",

On top of all of this, the game will force repetitive dialogue and gameplay if you make a small mistake and have to reset a puzzle.
