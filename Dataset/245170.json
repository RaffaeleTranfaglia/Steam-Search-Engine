It also have the best tutorial i have seen in a fighting game, it teach you every little aspect of the game, great for beginners.

            "review_text": "If you ever played 2D fighting games at arcades, this is your go-to fix for this kind of stuff! It has one of the most interesting styles ever, while you might initially be turned off by the idea of an 'all girl roster fighting game' (Hint: Its not! There are, surprisingly, male characters! And they are totally playable! As DLC. In the future. But it'll be free!). Yes, there are some use of sexuality in terms of presenting some of the characters, but that's only some of the characters. They are, more or less, inspired by other games, shows, and animes while giving its own unique little touch that makes them different.  Eg. Double, who is a shapeless blob that devours other characters to gain their abilities. If you ever wanted to play all of the characters at once, she(?) will be your go to gal!   Peacock, who takes all of our lovable American (COUGH I'M A CANADIAN SPY) cartoons and rolls them up into her own merry band of comedy inducing friends and throws out destruction.   Did I mention they all actually play differently? TAKE THAT, RYU, KEN, DAN, EVIL RYU, AKUMA, ONI, SAKURA, ETC ETC ETC. HOLY CRAP, MORE HADOUKENS!!!  The animation and art for each character is beautiful and smooth, as if it has its own life. The stage is brimming with life with its background characters doing their own thing. The gameplay is deep, and the tutorial is really well done. You can select your team format for a 1v1, 1v2, 1v3, 2v1, 2v2, 2v3, etc. The soundtrack is awesome. Each character has their own little quips for different characters, so you won't hear Injustice's Batman only say 'STAY DOWN' as his only victory line in here. Did I mention the soundtrack is awesome? Cuz if I didn't, its awesome. That, and the animation. I think I mentioned that too.  The only thing I'd say thats bad is that if you don't have a controller or fightstick, you'll have a hard time playing this on only a keyboard. So if you have a fightstick or a 360 controller, you'll have a grand time. If you have a PS3 controller, I recommend using an emulation program, such as MotionJoy, to emulate a 360 controller.",

The art and the graphics are really nice and I loved the soundtrack (just do a YouTube search for “The Fish Man's Dance” and “The Legend of the Skull Heart” -my two favorite- they are amazing!). Game has a comprehensive tutorial, gameplay in general is really good. The characters have a lot of style and personality, I love the cast, it’s very original. The only problem is that there are not enough characters since the roster is rather small. As for game modes it has different ones, like single player story, arcade mode and vs. I’m sure you will have fun in every one of them. By the way, the controls are intuitive and responsive. A must have if you are fan of anime and/or fighting games.  Con un combate y mecánicas divertidos, Skullgirls es un hermoso juego anime de peleas 2d. El arte y las gráficas son lindos y me encantó el soundtrack (solo haz una búsqueda en YouTube de “The Fish Man's Dance” y de “The Legend of the Skull Heart” -Mis dos favoritas- son increíbles). El juego tiene un tutorial muy completo, la jugabilidad en general es muy buena. Los personajes tienen un montón de estilo y personalidad, me encanta el elenco, es muy original. El único problema es que no hay suficientes personajes ya que la plantilla es algo pequeña. En cuanto a los modos de juego existen diferentes, como historia de un solo jugador, modo arcade y Vs. Estoy segura que te divertirás en cada uno de ellos. Por cierto, los controles son intuitivos y responsivos.  Un título obligado si eres fan del anime y/o de los juegos de pelea.",

Trying to get at something but in reality; only one will prevail in the end! It was a good ride, very comicy &amp; cartoony; definitely helps if you're feeling lonesome or down. Although you must play all characters to fully understand the story behind Skullgirls.  Characters: My favorite character is Peacock, she is a 13 year old-smoking-badass-cartoonloving-robot-kid thing! (Just kidding about that last part ^^;) But she is very well badass, I admire her design so much, it's very much original &amp; suave. Her personality is abit jerkish, but hey; what badass isn't a jerk?!  Soundtrack: I definitely love the soundtrack as well. Makes you think you're in one of those old timey theatre with abunch of people trying to cut in-front of you to see that badass movie. My favorite track so far is 'Streets Of New Meridian Stage.'  Attacks/Movement: Considering I'm not a fan of fighting games, this is rare in my case I enjoy fighting games. There was just something about this game that I liked! Probably it's unique attacks~ I do like the attack system, although I personally think some attacks should be limited &amp; the specials should be raised 1 up, for instance; you get hit, you get tension. Tension can unlock special attacks your character can use. And honestly, they have crazy attacks on just a Level 1 Tension.  All in all: Very beautiful &amp; creative game, definitely worth the buy! 10/10. &lt;3",

Learning to play the game is easy!  The tutorials are expansive and user friendly, even for people that are new to fighting games! The community is very supportive and provides feedback on gameplay to help newer players advance.  The character list may be relatively small when compared to other games.  However upon further exploration you will find the differences between each character more than make up for it. No one character is anything like another in terms of moveset, strategy, etc.  So whatever playstyle you prefer, there's bound to be character for you!  The team system allows for endless possibilities in terms of competition and strategy. Teams are well-balanced, and so a team of 3 is just as good as a team of 2, etc. Playing solo is not punished, as you are compensated for your lack of teamates in terms of damage and health.

Yet even though it's fun and a great time-waster, I felt more effort could be put into it. The storylines of each character and how fast-paced each campaign goes is just too fast and rushed, with some of the line-art still a bit dirty and unclean, it gives off a sense of imcompleteness, but sometimes, it's these flaws that create something unqiue, and enjoyable. Having quite improved AI than other fighting games, it also has beautiful revamped animations and backgrounds that are just tantalizing! Being made with love and care of some of the staff now creating Cryamore, I can't wait to see the developement and improvement of this game.

She also has a Mami (the madoka magica one) palette :^)  Cons -Requires time that you have to spend to become decent and learn how to chain different attacks of your character, then learn another one that can synergize with the one you learn before, so don't expect to just go in the multi and win costantly. -There are people that play this game, but as far as i can tell, there are not so much so you may have some problems finding a match once in a while. -Little roster of playing characters, at the moment there are 9 + 3 dlc char (that can be bought at 5 euros each) and other 2 that are in development -You may need an arcade stick to fully enjoy the gameplay, but it's not really necessary as it depends a lot on the character you want to use  Final thanks to Slippery Lil' Dude that explained me a loooot of things on this game and made it more enjoyable for me c:",

With easy-to-understand lessons about cancelling, executing and defending against mix-ups, as well as specific tutorials for each character in the game, Skullgirls is both an easy game to pick up and play, as well as a well-made gateway into the world of 2D fighters.  As for the merits of the game on its own, Skullgirls boasts a small but extremely varied cast of playable characters, ranging the gamut of every fighting game character archetype. As I delve deeper into fighting games, I come back to Skullgirls and find I understand and appreciate more and more of the special features Skullgirls boasts to improve its experience, learning where other games in the genre have been lacking.   Skullgirls is well worth the price, and I expect to be playing it for years to come.",

The character roster might seem a bit small at first, but every character is truly unique, and the game likes to emphasize that in their respective tutorials (which are very good, too). If the game's on sale, give it a try. It's a fun game to play with friends, especially those who have a similar or slightly higher skill level than yours. I've owned this game for quite some time, and I'm glad to see Lab Zero's continued support paid off, the game really feels different and better than it did before the numerous additions given to it throughout these years. As a side note, I'd reccomend getting a gamepad if you don't have one. Most of my friends who play on a keyboard don't seem to enjoy it as much, I don't think that's just a coincidence.",

With a solid tutorial system and a community that thrives on teaching new players how to be successful, Skullgirls is probably the best entry to the world of fighting games. Many of the techniques used in this game translate to other games, but if you're not versed in the genre it's very easy to pick up and learn the combos needed to be successful. Once you have the muscle memory you'll be nailing your opponents to the wall.  Online play tends to be a bit unforgiving, but lobby play lets you find players of similar caliber and hone your skills.  Definitely recommended to anyone interested in exploring fast-paced fighting games.",

PRACTICE! PRACTICE! never give up! the first 2 or 3 weeks will be tough and stressful   however, once you learn combo chains and/or tactics that work best for you, i can guarentee you will stand a greater chance against online verterans... like me! so don't stress, type quickly and accurately, remember combos, PRACTICE!, and most importantly, Have Fun! i cannot stress that part enough! in just 2 or 3 months, i guarentee you WILL be a pro and have even loads more fun!

Unfortunately it doesn't contain skull helmets (sort of?), or hats for that matter... where was I going with this? Who knows. What I'm trying to say is that it's  one hell of a fighting game.   It's a 2D fighter that seems simple on the outside, but once you start playing, you'll see all the techniques and such. The game looks good, bubbly, bright and bouncy, and no I'm not referring to the fighters. You've most likely noticed the roster is all [note: not anymore] female, with rather oversized... features. Don't let that put you off, only 4 of the characters show off the fanservice, and eventually you won't even notice it because the game is so much fun. The characters all have a story mode, showing a small backstory and why they're after the skull heart.  The controls are rather simple, and can even be played with a keyboard without much difficulty. If you're new to the fighting genre, I'd highly recommend having this game as your first. It has an extensive tutorial to teach you the ropes, and it's not overly complicated. There's a great connection from player to the developer on the various forums (both on steam and outside of steam), and the game is constantly being updated. If you ever have any problems with the game, it shouldn't be too hard to get help!  I'm not a big fan of fighting games, the only other series in the genre to interest me was Dragon Ball Z, so this review isn't coming from someone who simply loves the game because it's got a great fighting engine.

I'm still new to the fighting game genre, so I can't justifiably vouch for much of what it offers, but everything feels fluid and incredibly responsive. I need to get better.  Secondly, the animations are incredible. Every single frame in just one attack alone is filled with unique and detailed spritework-- it's some of the best 2D work I've seen in a fighting game.   Most of the games music is great, backgrounds are cool, lots of good things can be said about this game.

            "review_text": "In the fast-paced world of the fighting game tournament scene, there is one thing that matters above all else: balance. If a game has severely unbalanced fighters, then it may as well be thrown straight out the window. Another problem is cloning, to make it seem like a game has plenty of characters to go around, the devs may simply take one characters mechanics and re-apply it to another. We constantly see examples of games that just try too hard to shoehorn everything in to one crowded roster, and with games like Ultimate Marvel Vs Capcom 3 shoving 48 playable characters into the spotlight there is just no hope of a fair and balanced fight.  Thankfully, we have Skullgirls on pc now. When it comes to the lofty ambition of being the perfect tournament fighter, it manages to deliver on all levels! Lab Zero has made an already smashingly impressive console brawler shine even brigter on the PC. By bringing together a team of fighting game industry experts to craft Skullgirls into a pulse-pounding pandemoniac plethora of pugilistic perfection, Lab Zero has once again saved the day for fighting fans. What we have here is a set of 8 well-tuned femme fatales who are ready to kick ♥♥♥ and take names. You have the option of choosing either one full-powered character, a halved-strength duo, or a tag team trio of weaker fighters. No matter your choice you can rest assured that the game is ready to balance itself out, so choose the playing style that suits your tastes.  The graphical merits of Skullgirls are quite astounding, with each character fluidly hand animated in 1080p. The graphical quality is quite in it's own class, even upstaging recent fighters such as Blazblue. The stages themselves are no less detailed, with throngs of fully animated background characters, and a gorgeously parallaxed art style that almost feels three-dimensional. The eye-catching visuals are underlined by an impressive score by none other than Michiru Yamane, famous for her long running contribution to the aural tapestry of the Castlevania series. All of these elements perfectly meld together into a wonderfully film-noire/art deco aesthetic.  One last point I'd like to touch on is the excellent online gameplay, provided by the GGPO (Good Game Peace Out) netcode. It allows for a virtually lag-free online experience, regardless of the player's real-world proximity to one another. In my online experiences with Skullgirls I found no lag or dropped frames at all. In my humble opinion Reverge labs has crafted the finest tournament fighting experience possible, and for that I salute them. Skullgirls is well worth the price, so get out there and buy it today!",

To simply call this game gorgeous is an understatement. The art and animation is top-notch quality, and it is accompanied by an enjoyable soundtrack which I find myself listening to even when I'm not playing. The story is decent, and the characters showcase a variety of colorful personalities. This game is very well supported by the developers, receiving frequent updates for game balance and bugs. It is a very well balanced game, and the matchmaking system ensures that you will always face opponents of equal skill when playing online. If you prefer to play offline, the AI for the bots have appropriate settings for all skill levels, and they perform rather intelligently. I would recommend this to anyone wanting a new competitive game to play.",

I would reccommend this game if you are looking for an intense fighter. There are so many combos to learn, so many match ups to understand, so many mechanics to get down, that this game can get a little overwhelming. But it is all worth it, because when you land those combos, it is just so satisfying. The mechanics in this game are definitely complimented by the beautiful visuals and the quality audio.

This fighting game is very well designed but personally I don't believe the combos should be able to extend so long, especially since they aren't too difficult to perform, though this does separate the decent players from the great ones. I wouldn't reccommend online mode to new players unless you're playing with your friends. The game doesn't have a proper skill-based matchmaking system. Probably the most fun I've had with a fighting game ever. 9/10 (P.S. Get Beowulf if you're into this game)",

Give it a shot, the smooth gameplay and the surprisingly interesting story and the excellent voice acting and the overall presentation might just sway you to end up really loving the game.  I like fighter games quite a bit, but not on a competitive level, really. Never had the need to be the winner of a tournament or even play online too much. I generally keep to local play against (or with, if the game allows it) a few friends. The most enjoyable part of a VS fighter, to me, are the character designs, animations, and the fun factor when playing with a person next to you. The following is from the perspective of such a person - I won't be talking about online play or communities or pro tier gaming. Just what's interesting and what's fun.  I prefer games like Melty Blood and Guilty Gear - easy to pick up and impressive to look at. The gameplay of Skullgirls is quite similar to Melty Blood, I'd say (except less air-oriented :P). The characters are generally very fast and mobile, the attacks can be linked freeform, and the matches can be extremely furious and quick. There's quite a few really clever additions - the automatic infinite combo breaker, the tech colors, the way the blocking works, it's all simple solutions to problems that plagued other games.  The designs in this game were offputting the first time I've seen it, quite a long time a go. It seemed like sloppy fanservice without much heart. Then at some point I had the chance to try it out, and starting right of the bat with the menus, my opinion began changing. Bought it after only a few fights. It's just that good.  The presentation is done in an art deco manner, like an old cinema, and it really works out well. The music fits, the backgrounds are strange and varied, the mood is quite unique. I just enjoy what I see and hear from the moment it boots up to the moment I quit the game. There is a surprising amount of disturbing imagery, though. Some artwork is really not for the squeemish.  The character animations, in particular, are extremely well done and quite imaginative. Don't let the small roster fool you. The characters are interesting and differ significantly one from another, sometimes even down to the inputs for basic moves. Squiggly, for instance, has the capability to _move the screen_ temporarily, which is something I've never seen done before. The future characters promise lots of very unique abilities as well.  I can pretty safely say that this is my favourite VS fighter at the moment, and probably will be for quite a while. It's great fun, even solo, and even more with friends.",

A lot of memorizing goes into this game if you really want to learn it, A lot of the imputs are pretty lenient and its pretty easy to link one hit into another without any trouble of timing.

However, I caved in and gave it a go after all, and I must say that I was very pleasantly surprised.  Boasting some of the most fantastic HD artwork and animation in a 2D fighter I've ever seen, this game is also full to the brim with stunning, high-octane quickfire combat the akin to BlazBlue, Guilty Gear or, given the team mechanic, Marvel's VS. series. It's a finely balanced piece of fighting gold that, while lacking in characters, punches the personality of each of its combatants through the roof. You'll find yourself grinning at quips and one-liners, as well as face-palming over terrible puns and reminiscing with one character's particular fascination with 80's and 90's cartoon quotes.  Overall, this is far worth the asking price of $15 (given that you're not buying it on sale), as it offers up more than its fair share of fighting goodness for the cost. If you're a fan of fighting games at all, especially fast paced ones, then this is a given.",

This game has some of the most fluid and smooth animations I've ever played in a fighter, it's truly amazing.

The art is very beautiful, some might be turned down by the obvious anime influences, but that's just personal taste. Backgrounds are very pleasing to the eye, as well as animations. 1400 sprites of animation per character? Yes sir. Characters are, like I mentioned above, very interesting both to look at and play. Some might say, that they're oversexualized, and he would be correct. However, most of them are as much sexualized as they are scary. Example: you have your normal catgirl type of character, yet at the same time, she is basically a zombie. She can detach her head and attack enemies with it, and so forth. They aren't damsels in distress, so me personally, I don't mind this particular character design. Tutorials are fabulous. Useful both for beginners and pros, they explain pretty much everything. Not only how different characters combo work, but also the very basics of practically every fighting game. Just like tutorial should be. On the other hand, small roster is a bit of a nuiscance, but this will be fixed with additional characters. For free, for a certain amount of time, which is really nice. That's... pretty much all I can think of when it comes to downsides. From a technical point of view, again, some people might consider the art style and the overall 'feel' of this title as something unbearable. If you find this okay, though, then wait no more and check this out, it's definitely worth your time.",

Something about the art style and design really interested me, and I'm always up for a new fighting game - even amongst the really terrible ones, there's only a few I actually hate.  I kept tabs on it for a while, but for a couple of years, there wasn't really a lot of progress. Then, about late 2010/early 2011, I came across the revamped SG, which was the beginning of its shaping up to the current model. I was marveled at how much the graphics had improved. Having a composer and voice actors whose work I enjoyed, also continued to pique my curiosity, and having Mike Z, whose name I recognized from fighting game websites, working on the game's mechanics only served to tell me that this was going to be a major labor of love.  As news continued to come out for the game, I only kept getting more and more excited. I worried that I was getting hyped for nothing, and that it wouldn't live up to my expectations. And sadly, I wasn't even able to play it when it first released - I ended up moving only days before it dropped, and couldn't afford it. Thankfully, though, I had come into some Microsoft Points about a month later, and was able to get it on Xbox Live.  I was pretty much floored. It was everything I had hoped for and more. The graphics, the humor, the story, the voice acting, the mechanics, the music... it's all just this perfect little package of awesomeness. I played it for longer in one sitting than I've probably played any other game except maybe Brawl. Many months later, after I'd been more or less forced to move my 360 into the other room and my PS3 became more prominent, I went ahead and bought it on that system, too. There have been very few times when I've purchased a game on more than one platform without them being radically different, but Skullgirls was worth every penny.  Then the PC version was announced. I'm not a huge PC gamer guy anymore (never really was, but I had at least played as much as I did my consoles once upon a time), but once the Indiegogo rolled around, I knew I had to help these guys out. I also saw a chance to cross-promote one of my own characters, but there was no way I could afford $1000, even if I had just gotten my income tax check. But I made a few deals and I was able to get Patron Saint status, mostly to give back to these guys who had given me so much enjoyment.  Since I wasn't a big PC gamer, I never even got Steam until the release of Bad Bots (which I just had to buy, for various reasons). So I had Steam for only a short while before Skullgirls released. I figured there was no way that I could run something this powerful on my old laptop, but lo and behold, after just one patch of the beta it ran smoothly. If more fighters come to Steam and are this fluid, I'm gonna eventually go broke.  So while Skullgirls isn't for everyone, it certainly is for me.",

Beginner Level lobbies are more friendly.

The controller compatibility was amazing; I managed to hook up my PS2 controller through an adapter and play the game instantly without any trickery or jumping through hoops, plus the background music is superb to boot.

            "review_text": "I love this game... and I hate it.  There seems to be a few things I noticed as time went by as I played fighting games. People tend to favor the much more flashy moves and lengthy combos. Skullgirls does that, moreso I feel, along with some of the newer fighting games. I liked playing Street Fighter 3 and 4 along with Tekken while competing with friends.  While I do love this game, there are things I don't necessarily agree with. Sure, the pokes, punishes, supers, specials and overall gameplay is satisfying. I don't agree with the lengthy and exploitable combos and the IPS system is a bit skippy and sometimes buggy. Sometimes it would activate against me even if I landed my first hit and when a player spammed the same combo it never seemed to kick in. There are plenty of combos that are actually based around burst baiting requires you to burst or end up dying anyway (if you burst you get thrown into another combo). A lot of players suggest anticipating the resets if a combo seems too lengthy and the truth is I've never been able to counter a combo string during a reset (probably due to lag but who knows).  I'll say it once and I'll say it again. I do not agree with the two bar health system for solo vs. solo games. In any fighting game, like Injustice or Killer Instinct. Before they implemented this, me and a couple of sparring partners were able to analyze each other's fighting techniques and bad habits during first and second round with the third and final round having both players mix up our playstyles or lose. I don't know why people seem to dislike this sytem and many say it's based on luck (untrue). Through this sytem I was able to make incredible comebacks even if I didn't know a great combo (I would stick to a combo that did some great damage but it was never too lengthy). The way it is now is with people making their way to deal the most damage with the lengthiest combos, instead of analyzing an opponent and catching them offguard with a well hit super or special. Yes, because a game like Injustice is a great example, especially during the pro tournament where all the 'professional players' just used superman and spammed ice breath and lazer beams.  I just don't agree with the two bars, it's why I left a lot of solo games or if I did stick around to play I would allow the player of the losing round to bring the rest of my bar down so the last round is much more fair. Getting that off of my chest I like the anime type artstyle and the animations. The animations are smooth and the moves are quick, I kind of understand why the game favors lengthy combos, mainly because it is supposed to be very fast paced. While I agree with it being fast paced, lengthy combos actually make the game feel dragged out. I did get a hang of the moves and right now I have a few solid combos but overall I don't like doing lengthy combos because it feels like I'm more or less exploiting the game.  Not much to say other than it is a solid well done game. Although I like it, the game is changing away from my tastes, it seems. With the addition of a two bar system, the lengthy combos, and the exploitable burst system it can still be fun and there are more characters to be added onto it. It was well worth the money, though.",

I know I'm not supposed to be expecting much from a fighting game, since that's not his point...but still. Even if the artworks are great, the story of each character is shockingly short (doesn't exceed 10 minutes if you don't count the fights). Also, it is poorly told (some of the writing is plain as water, and I'm not speaking about the super predictable situations, events and outcomes, or on the contrary the unexplained lore that's needed to understand the plot), and sometimes even not told at all! I remember times when a fight would occur without ANY explanation at all as for his reason to take place. Just as if there was a fight there to, well, fight...because ♥♥♥♥ that's a fighting game. I mean it's really like ' Hey Samson you wanna eat an ice cream?' and BOOM *insert fight with random character you didn't even know existed*  Last but not least, the dub is somewhat uneven. It's sometimes perfectly fluent, and other times it seems like the voice actor is reciting a lesson.  But then again, flawed as it is, the story mode is far from essential to a fighting game, and aside it, everything's almost perfect.  That's why I highly recommend it. ",

But all joking aside, this game is the perfect gateway for people who are new to the fighting genre thanks to the incredible tutorial and how quickly can one get used to the gameplay. However, this does not mean that just anyone can pick up the gamepad/keyboard/fightstick and instantly get good like in Super Smash Bros. or Marvel VS Capcom, no.  Hardcore fighting gamers are going to love how many different 'ultra-long' combos can they come up with, even though the game gives the beaten-up opponent the option to instantly break 'endless' combos (in context, this is when the attacker only does the same serie of combos over and over again without diversity in his or her moves). So not only does the game enthuse diverse creativity in combos, it also gives a chance to free yourself from spamming.  The artwork is uncannily pretty. Not only in the character designs, but in the way they move and punch around.  Each character is unique in its own way and has its own attributes (yes, even the joke 'clone' character 'Fukua' which was added after positive response from an April Fool gag by Lab Zero). My personal favourites are Peacock, Valentine and the DLC character Squigly.  The controls are exactly what you expect from a Capcom-like fighting game: easy to get by. However, my only complaint is that if a keyboard is the only controller available to you, you are going to have a REALLY hard time executing 'full-circle' attacks (with a gamepad, you are supposed to to a 360 rotation with the joystick).  However, if you expect this game to have a great single player mode, keep in mind that while there IS a story mode, it is only worth playing to unlock some of the alternate skins for the fighters. Unlike Super Smash Bros. Brawl's Subspace Emissary which arguably was a whole different game, or Injustice's story mode which felt like watching some sort of Justice League special episode, the Skullgirls story mode is pretty weak for most of the non-DLC characters. I'm serious, the fighters with the most interesting storylines were Squigly and Big Band, which aren't even in the core game. But hey, most people buy fighting games for the Versus mode, so in the end this really isn't a major issue.  The last thing I am going to tell you about isn't really about the game itself, but about the DLCs. When a new character comes out, it will be free for three months. That means if you bought the base game before or during it's free availabilty, you can still keep it afterwards! Sadly if you did not buy the base game during that time, the DLC's price will rise depending on the time passed since release. This is a tactic to enthuse people to buy the game as early as possible.  To conclude, I am going to give this game a big, solid 9/10 for the amazing gameplay, the diverse character roster and the great art. Really worth the $15.",

(Amazing cost whenever on sale.)  - Interesting characters, world and stories.  - It's everything I wish Marvel vs. Capcom 3 would be.  - DLC characters are free for a limited time after release! (And reasonably priced afterwards!)  The Bad:  - Online play is extraordinarily difficult due to players being far too skilled.  - On lower bandwidth connections (1.5 mb/s) the game is barely playable online... at all.  - Many of the good things others say about this game are not true.  - Infinite comobs are real. Prepare for infinite salt.  - All players side-step the anti-infinite-combo-system allowing infinites anyway.  Honestly, I kind-of hate the game. I regret the purchase. However, I got it very cheap, so I didn't lose much on it. The story is enjoyable. So even though I can't play online, I can still play through each character's story.  There are many positive aspects to this game. Unfortunately, it has the same problem that every fighting game has with online play: lag and abusvie tactics. If you lag hard, you'll start teleporting around the screen. The game tends to favor the player with the better connection. So while you teleport on your screen, they have a smooth experience on their's. Winning is impossible for newer players thanks to the legions of god-like players that populate the game. You aren't ready to compete with the greatest players on Earth? Better not play online! My winrate for online is about 1%. Playing online is completely pointless.  Best of all, no one cares. The developers implement mechanics which are supposed to prevent abuse, but instead cause it. They then go on to defend these decisions. They don't care. The community doesn't care either. Say anything bad about the game, players or developers and the fanbois come out of everywhere to defend the game. They think it's fun to crush people, and maintain an environment where this is possible. Talking to the players of this game is a complete and total waste of time.  Save yourself some time and skip this.",

            "review_text": "This game was one that I wanted to purchase for a very long time, and even though I payed full price, I'd say it was worth it. I'm very happy with the game, it features great art and anitmations, the style, soundtrack and the atmosphere are awesome, game play is fun yet challenging and the stories interplay in an ineresting way. (Look down to see my review on different aspects of the game or to see the TLDR)  DLC: The game comes with a lot of DLC characters, and new ones are being added frequently. Each one adds something to the game and I recommend investing in some of the characters available outside of the main 8 (9 wink wonk). Plus steam will often offer the most recent DLC characters for free for a period of time so make sure to keep an eye out! The Eliza DLC was amazing, I was lucky enough to get her for free, but she is definitely kick-♥♥♥ as all hell. Her story (which is the longest of them so far) and move set were so worth it. (worth buying)  MULTIPLAYER: Multiplayer is always fun with a friend, and when in training mode (multi), you can literally beat the crap out of eachother endlessly without taking damage, it's a good way to train and familiarize yourself with some of the more challenging combos.  GAMEPLAY: Combos are life in this game, and because of the fightstick style controls, there is fairly hefty variety of combos for each character. There are basic combos that each character will share controls wise, and there are also some combos/blockbusters unique to individual characters. Blocking is definitely recommended however, while there is no guard break in this game, the damage you take is simply taken down to almost nothing. So basically you will still lose some stamina but its like the equivalent of 1 health per hit, even with epic combos. Speaking of epic blockbusters, some of the tougher ones are inSANE. Super cool attacks.  ART AND CHARACTERS: The arts and animations, aside from the fan service, in this game are amazing, and very intricate. Plus yknow fanservice. Every characters design is unique and each one's move set and play style is different. For instance Parasol and Peacock have more ranged based moves, while Cerebella and Filia are more suitable for close ranged combat. The combo's tend to follow a similar pattern for the most part, but each characters 'epic' blockbusters/combos are pretty different, some are harder to work out than others. It's always interesting to work with a different character and find out how to use them the most effectively. There is an in game tutorial mode that will basically walk you through each character and different techniques in the game, easy to learn, tough to master. Tutorial 10/10  STORY: Every story has it's unique qualities, and most of them eventually tie together. There will be fights where they may seem random and out of context, but never the less, they are honestly just put there to give you more game time. The option is available to skip dialogue and get straight to the action, just in case you are replaying a story or honestly don't care or want to read it all. I loved the backstory for each character, and with every added character more depth is also added to the scheme of things. Each story isn't heavily reliant on each other, so each one is able to stand on it's own, even if it refers to other characters (so you don't have to feel obligated to get the DLC to progress the story, though I recommend it anyway).  THINGS TO THINK ABOUT:  SAVING: One thing I'd have to note is that when you get the game, the stories are great, but each one is fairly short (30 min), and because of this there is no save feature when in story mode. It will save after you beat the boss in each story so that's not an issue. I personally wish the stories were longer just because they are pretty interesting and entertaining, but it would most likely mess with the game set up. Just something to be aware of.   CONTROLS: The concept behind the controls for the game were based on the fightstick arcade style. This means joystick and LMH kick and punch buttons. One thing about the game is that it doesn't give clear directions on which buttons to press for which result, with the exception of the tutorials (kinda, not really). Yes these are a little awkward to get used to, especially when using a controller (which I still recommend, it gets easier I promise). The keyboard controls are also easy to get used to and makes remembering the position of kick and punch buttons easy, but a lot of the combos require the rotational movement of a joystick (which are still achievable with the keyboard, no worries), and navagating the menus is a tad odd with the keyboard, which is why I recommend using a controller. If you need help figuring out what each button is, play through the tutorials. The bottom will show which key/button you pressed to get a result in relation to the fightstick setup. You'll see, trust me.   DIFFICULTY CURVE: A lot of people talk about the difficulty curve being too high. The truth is it is a tad more challenging than most fighters, button mashing may get you through most of the normal fights, but when you get to the boss, you may need to have a little strategy. There are 6 different difficulty settings, which I believe are; Sleepwalk, Easy, Normal, Hard, Extreme and Nightmare. If you want to breeze through the game and simply play for fun or the story, you want to keep the setting on Normal and below (at least at the start). If you want to try for a more challenging game, go for Hard and above. Like I said, this game is a tad harder than most normal fighting games, even Normal may present a bit of a challenge to a newcomer. This being said there are two lower settings so don't hurt yourself if you can't get through the stories on the first go. On the flip side if you are really good and want to put your skills to the test, there are levels that WILL freaking final exam the crap out of your 2d fighting abilities.   TLDR;  All in all I'd recommend this to anyone who loves fighters, wants a challenge or just to have fun and can appreciate the amazing asthetics and back stories (however short they are). It's one of my favorite fighters, and frankly one of my favorite games in my library. There is so much replay value in this game, I love it and would recommend it (and have) to any and all of my friends. (yes it's even worth full price). You get used to the fightstick style, plus its definitely worth getting the DLC &lt;3",

You could go play Street Fighter IV and get thrown in the deep end with just a list of character chains to perform, but you won't learn anything that way.  You wont know anything about Mix-ups, hit confirmation, overheads, cross ups and how to block them. This is why I recommend anyone new to fighting games to play Skullgirls. It actually teaches you important game mechanics with an excellent tutorial, which is something Street Fighter IV fails at completely.  The game is heavily influenced by Marvel vs Capcom 2 from what I can tell .. because I played that game to death back in the early 2000s ... it plays exactly the same, with team assists, snapback attacks, ground recovery, super jumps, air dashes and hyper combos ... errr I mean Blockbuster Attacks .. :)  Combos are clean and feel great to perform and its not hard to rack up hits with just some basic chains.  The art style is great and the music and sounds are very fitting. Character art is very 'anime', while it might not appeal to some I like it a lot.  Highly recommended.",

Doesn't translate well to the keyboard and I personally can't play fighting games with a console controller, but I could say that about any fighting game on the computer. The tuturial can be very confusing, regardless, as it doesn't note what key binds you have set for attacks and just names them HK LK etc, so you're left guessing half the time. If you spend five hours memorizing what keys do what you still have to memorize what keys do what and what the game likes to call them. You can, of course, just skip the tutorial entirely and mess around for a while in training mode to figure things out for yourself, but the tuturial does have some helpful hints, which is why it frustrated me how confusing it could get.

It's easy to spam and get a combo here and there, but if you chain them properly, which I learned slowly, but quicker than usual because of the tutorial, you can lock someone down so effectively they go from full to nothing in one long combo sweep.  Short version, because I'm not posting all of my thoughts: it's worth every penny. Net code is glorious, the combos and every strike feel good, and the art style is pleasant...at least to me. Yes it can seem a bit pervy, but it's certainly unique.  Recommended: buy on a mild sale. Fifteen is a touch much for what I got out of it, but I got it for sale for five dollars, so I couldn't be happier with it. However, for ten bucks, or even twelve, it's all kinds of worth your time.  So if you see extra green around the price and a percentage, run, don't walk, to the nearest 'add to cart' button.",

Single player mode is over quick, but the Story mode is worth it for the background on all the girls (and guy), and unlocks 2 more toons (Valentine and Double) stories.   Personal Rating: Fun, buy it if you like fighting games Percentage Rating: 80% - Fast Paced combat, with a steep learning curve if you want to dominate online.",

(This is the exception)  Sure, I played Tekken when I was younger, but that was just a mass of button mashing and spamming. I heard about this game from the infamous Matt and Woolie (Who make a cameo in the game), as well as one of my friends mentioned that he played it a lot. I was also a bit reluctant to buy it when people said that it was one of the more difficult fighting games.  I didn't know what to expect from this game really. I bought it since it was on sale, and heard a few good things about it, so I jumped and took the chance. I just thought it was some fighting game where you spam buttons or do combos or something... It's not that. Skullgirls has a pretty damn steep learning curve. Instantly tried playing Arcade on 'Normal' and I was used to wipe the floor (sometimes literally). If you're somewhat new to fighting games like I was, do the Training levels more than once. Even on 'Easy', a poor player will get nearly or completely destroyed. (Damn you Big Band) Since I'm only a few hours in, I've still got much to learn. But damn, this game is really addictive. Recently, the game hasn't left my mind. Getting a chain higher than 3 gives this sense of achievement. I really love and enjoy the art style; it has its own uniqueness to it.   Some criticism: The campaigns could be more related to each other as well as a bit longer. Other than that, I've been having fun.   Goodbye productivity! (Again...)",

I followed the crowd myself and stopped playing but I have fond memories of the early days of the game/when i picked it back up after the steam version dropped. The major reason why I personally dropped the game was due to the constant changing. I know the game is Mike Z's love child and he wants to keep tweaking and tweaking and tweaking... but the constant changes coupled with the complete openness of the development process for new characters actually decreased my interest in the game rather than boosting it.   Overall I say buy it for the beautiful artwork, soundtrack and sound mechanics but dont expect too many people to play with. and if you are brand NEW know that people have been grinding for like 3 years at this point so you probably wont even be able to hit them and they will reset you 100 times until you die.

WORDS DO MEAN STUFF, AND THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LOCAL COMPETITIVE AND LOCAL COOPERATIVE . Does everyone just sit around and play with themselves nowadays ? Now I have to double check if Mortal Kombat X has 'local' action, because I was compelled to give Ed Boon a nasty tweet (and I opened a twitter account just to tweet him), because it seems that Mortal Kombar X has no 'local' action (based on the advertizements and reviews I looked at) .

Some of these female characters are nice looking sometimes, but there is a lot of goofy, gruesome, hideous, and wierd in this game .

After some time I got interested in this game thanks to screenshots, artwork and flipnote (R.I.P). My freind waltera gifted me this game and then I could see what is this game and is it good. For starters for a game has a beutiful artstyle, with everything hand drawn, and great music that reminds me of the 1920-1940. Each chericter looks nice and with suprisingly big personalities. From a circus girl that works for the mafia, to a crazy lab experiment gone wrong, to even a cyborge cartoon chericter their is a great lineup. Each chericter is made in a way that no chericter is better then another chericter, just how skilled you are with the chericter. The story is nothing to write hame about, just the normal evil object that wil grant you a wish story, but how the chericters deal with it is the interesting part. Matches can go from 1 v 1 to 1 v 3 or 2 v 3.ect and they find ways to balence the chericters in theis situations. The best part of this game it it has a tutorial mode that actualy teaches you how to do everything, and in a way that makes sence. Heck the DLC is done right in this game, having new chericters free for three mounths when they are relesed and then going for a cheap price, that is nice. This is deffenetly a game I would suggest to anyone who is a fighting gammer, or to anyone who whants to try out a fighting game.    P.S. Bloody Marie, Continue? Bloody Marie, Continue?

'What are you, gay?' the average internet-goer may inquire, and sir / madame / wolf / otherkin, that is not a question even I can answer, as I identify as a genderfluid planet.  For the fightin' game vets, Skullgirls is a 6-button fighter that feels like the perfect middle ground between the tactics of Street Fighter and the combo chaos of Marvel VS Capcom. The mechanics are varied and unique between the small-yet-growing cast of characters (the only 'Ken' literally started out as an april fool's joke, and even then it's hardly the same character). Variable team sizes of 1 to 3 is a huge part of your pre-game choice and playstyle as it directly and dramatically affects the power and health of your individuals and how many assists you get. The combos chain fluidly, the action stays fast, and wins feel earned.  For the newcomers, this is a fantastic introduction to fighting games, or a great one to play casually. There are step-by-step tutorials, ranging from the basic buttons and mechanics to how each character's unique moves work together. I had no experience with the infamous insane difficulty leaps between difficulty settings, and there's neat storylines for each character explaining why they're all clawing each other's eyes out in the first place. The frantic pace makes even button mashing exciting, and all of the aesthetics look friggin' sweet. Which brings me to my next point...  The atmosphere is inviting and flashy, the music is snazzy and classy, and the animations are as smooth and beautiful as the characters. This is quite literally art in motion, and it all comes together nearly flawlessly. I don't think I have anything bad to say about this game other than some of the paid DLC (which are offered for free in the first while they are released) but eh, that shouldn't detract from the rest of it. A steal of an experience for the 3 dollars or so it's on sale for at the time of writing.  Oh, and there's a Zone-Tan skin for one of the girls, Squigly. There is also a Zone-Tan background sprite in the game. Steam wouldn't allow me to tell me who that is if you don't know. Among that, there's plenty of other sneaky references and nods to things in places like background characters, voice lines, the moves themselves, and the fighter's color palettes.",

            "review_text": "If you're into fighting games or want to try out such games, Skullgirls has your fix.  Skullgirls is a fighting game, just like any other. It has a story mode, arcade mode, training mode and of course, multiplayer.   What makes Skullgirls stand out from the other fighters besides the vast amount of   vase    females in the roster, is how the game is playable by any controllor to some extent. I can say from personal experience that the game is perfectly playable with a keyboard, once you learn how to do a 360 with your arrow keys. Of course, you can change the keys in the control settings if you don't like the default keyboard settings. The game also supports an Xbox controller and of course, the good ol' fightstick.   Skullgirls is also a good game for first-timers due to the training mode, which explains ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING about fighting games, step by step. You learn about combos, cancels, counters and so on. Besides the tutorial, th game is good for newcomers because there aren't that many playable characters compared to how many characters are in games like King of Fighters. With a reasonable amount of characters in the game, a newcomer can quickly learn about each character's abilities, pros and cons.   Speaking of characters, each one is specialized around certain type of fighting. One character is built around grapples, second is all about cancels, and a third is built for the purpose to give your opponent some salty symphonies.   There aren't that many newcomers on the game nowadays, but you can easily find people on the multiplayer. Just don't trust the beginner lobbies, you're going to encounter people who know each and every frame of the game.   All in all, I rate this game 9/10, I'd give my kidneys to Lab Zero, but I hear they're no longer taking donations.",

The game's tutorial is amazing, as it teaches you about all the techniques you will need to know to play basically any fighting game, along with teaching you the basics of each character in order to see which one you will use the most. Speaking of characters, one of the few problems with this game is that the character roster is very small. There are currently only 10 fighters (including the 2 DLC characters), but more are going to be added as DLC, which will be very nice. I also enjoy how this game covers both casual and competitive play. The Story and Arcade modes are very fun and challenging on the higher difficulties, and the Multiplayer isn't too shabby, either. Lag isn't that big of a problem when playing online, and it's always fun to go against other people, wether they're in the same room as you or across the country. The game also looks very nice. It has a movie-theater style theme to it, which may sound strange at first, but in-game you'll know what I mean. The stages are also very well-made, with exceptional musical accompaniment. Overall, Skullgirls is a great fighting game to pick up if you're looking to get into fighting games, and also if you're a diehard fan of them. I give it a well-deserved 9/10.",

While I have no issue with 2D fighters, there is one problem with this one that makes a lot of the more powerful game-changing moves unusable. The fact that this game started out on a console that then moved to PC means that the arrow keys have to take place of an analogue controller. This makes the rotations required for a lot of combinations very difficult to use if you're relying on your keyboard. I needed several attempts just to get consistent quarter turns, several more attempts for the more complicated rotations and a full rotation is downright impossible (for me at least).  If you have a lot of experience with 2D fighters (or a lot of patience to try mastering the controls for this one), then the keyboard controls shouldn't be too big an issue for you. However, if you're new to fighting games on the PC, I would seriously recommend getting a controller if you want to play Skullgirls. It's a good looking game, but it is an example of how making a cross-platform game can have some unfortunate drawbacks.",

New characters have been added which is cool, and more are coming I hear! Aww baby.    As a big fan of fighting games (though I'm terrible at them), I definitely love the fluidity of Skullgirls. It's basic enough so that any casual gamer can pick up and mash some buttons to achieve victory, and deep enough for pros to pull some ridonky donk combos and have some epic bouts.   Big fan of character designs. Everyone is unique and while the fanservice might put some off, I kind of dig it. Sexy characters, sexy jazzy soundtrack, and lots of neat tributes to a variety of games can be found.  Skullgirls managed to soar its way into my heart as one of my favourite fighting games.

The online multiplayer was smooth and I have yet to experience any latency.   My only dislike is the wait time to find an opponent online.

I can't wrap my head around the idea that you need to push seven different keys at once to get a certain move to go off, and even when I do manage to finally get it down, there's no chance in hell that I'll be able to do it in the heat of a match. Besides, the idea of characters just fighting each other with very little reason always struck me as... shallow? That's the nicest word I have for it. Violence for no good reason isn't escapism, it's just people being awful to each other. Fighting games are, in my opinion, one of those things that I really would rather not have anything to do with.  So, when I tell you that Skullgirls is perhaps my second or third favorite game of all times, you probably want to listen in.  I don't know what it is about this insane, awesome romp of flashing lights and partly clothed girls that makes it such an experience for me, but it really is. The gameplay is the most fun I've had in a long, long time doing anything at all. The A.I. is engaging on it's own, and varried enough that it's not trivial to find easy exploits in it. Multiplayer support is actually surprisingly robust, and quite the enjoyable experience if you don't mind losing a lot. The characters are funny and dark and fully realized, even if the story is nothing to praise. The animations are beautiful, matching aesthetics and graphics in a way that is simply fun to look at. The soundtrack is nearly perfect, setting the tone brilliantly for each scene, managing to match the visuals in a highly appealing and completely competent way. The controls are easy enough to use that you can pick them up and start winning on the lower difficulty levels in only a half hour, but deep enough that you can continue to challenge yourself with more and more complex combinations. And, take it from me, you don't have to be very good to get a great experience from this game – I'm one of the worst gamers I know, and I still have an absolute blast.  Oh, and the character models are hot. If your into that sort of thing. I guess I don't really consider that a big part of the experience, but it is technically true.  If you don't mind playing an awesome and beautiful game, you should totally pick up Skullgirls. It won't disappoint you, I can guarantee it.",

The more charaters you pick the less powerful they are and they easier they are to defeat. There are only 8 characters that come with the game but I would recommend getting the DLC characters, 2 of them are free. The DLC characters have a story that can be played through as well.

            "review_text": "PLEASE READ IN ITS ENTIRETY, THIS REVIEW IS LENGTHY BUT CONCISE:  This is a really nice fighting game. Despite my meager sum of hours at this point (7.4) and my limited experience with fighting games in general, this game really helped me learn the general meta of fighting games through its insanely well put together tutorial. Any beginner should really pick this as their first fighting game if they can, and if they've been having trouble getting into fighting games, this game should put them right in there. The only catch is that if you want to get into it, you HAVE to play the tutorial. That said, my assumption is that this game has enough depth for any experienced player to hop right in and enjoy (of course utilizing the tutorial and training mode to get comfortable with each character).  In terms of the playability, I am pleased. It has liquid smooth gameplay (as far as I'm concerned) and runs at a rock solid 60 on my Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga. I personally play with the keyboard, since my options involve a 360 controller and said keyboard (and trust me, the controller doesn't do this game any favors - the keyboard is DEFINITELY the better choice). That being said, if you don't have a fight stick, don't feel like you can't play this game and if you have a controller, don't use it. One character I've run into that gives me issue with not having a fight stick is Cerebella, because one of her blockbusters involves a 360 motion, and that is difficult to replicate with wasd. Another character that gave me trouble was Peacock, because one of her blockbusters involved cancelling a grab into said blockbuster, and I was having trouble because my keyboard is bluetooth, and the latency is too slow (so basically this one is negligible, since I did manage to pull off the blockbuster in the end).  RECOMMENDED KEYBOARD BINDINGS: W-UP S-DOWN A-LEFT D-RIGHT J-LK K-MK L-HK U-LP I-MP O-HP SPACE-Pause ENTER-Select If desired (for team play): ;-Macro 1 P-Macro 2 Leave all other commands unbound.  The character cast is pretty small, two of which (Squigly and Big Band) I do not have, so that leaves me with 8 playable characters: Double, Filia, Ms. Fortune, Peacock, Cerebella, Valentine, Parasoul and Painwheel. However, each character comes with an amount of depth that shows each of them has been crafted with utmost care. Unfortunately, the amount of play time I have does not allow me to discuss the balancing of each of the characters, so I'll leave that to someone with more time in the game.  This game is for one to two players. The gameplay is pretty good, and this I CAN talk about in terms of balance, because there are three ways to play, and each player doesn't necessarily need to choose the same one. The three ways are: one character, two characters and three characters. To balance it out, the damage and health of each character is divided by the amount of characters on a team. When a player has more than one character, the player can use assists, even during blockbusters, and you can also switch between characters, which CAN deal damage.  I have not used the ranked internet play, though I hear the netcode is solid. I HAVE done two person local play, and this works very well, as I was using my keyboard and the other person was using my controller.  Some extra good points involve the simplest key binding process I have ever seen in a fighting game and also a phenomenal jazzy soundtrack that I bought and consequently listen to in order to relax or do work.  In terms of the poor points in this game - I personally can only think of one, and that's the fact that I'm not proficient enough with fighting games to find any flaws.  Hope this review was helpful,  Visiorex",

I understand frames, combo creation, and could even use this as a springboard for other fighting games. This is due to all the time they spent on the tutorials and extensive training mode. The game controls simply enough never getting too complex with stick movements, and once you begin to learn these and put them in combos, you feel great. The characters and backgrounds are all drawn which looks very nice and the game runs locked at 60fps. (Important for a fighting game.) Music and soundtrack fit the environment well and I enjoy Michiru's work. Online works well enough thanks to thier GGPO system. The best part honestly is how they handle thier DLC as when you purchase the game, you have access to the Endless Beta which has all the DLC characters inside and even the ones they are still working on. This creates interesting feedback on characters still in the works. You can also see which you may want to buy. Though too late for the others, Beowulf will be free for three months upon release. I recommend ten-fold.",

Ironically, it reminds me of an indie version of Marvel Vs Capcom. the reason why is because of it's similarities of gameplay, for instance, it allows the player to have three combat choices before selecting characters. wether you prefer to fight 'mano a mano' or as a team of 2 or 3, which ever you prefer. it also utilises assits in team battles, hyper combos, tag in/tag outs, c c c c c combo breakers (sorry, had to say it lol) and the list goes on.  The character roster, while somewhat small, still has some fun, bizzare characters with their own playstyle, strengths and weaknesses. and ironically all the cast members are, as the name of the game implies, are all Female... with the execption of two male fighters. you can quickly identify which role fits who, like for instance some are combo based, some play 'keep-away', some are grapplers and so on and so forth. the designs of each character are Really well done, they animate really well, their voices are great and well.. Their girls and some designs are well.. I won't spare the details cause it's self explaniatory. Combat wise is pretty much what you'd expect from a traditional fighting game. it's a 6 button fighter with 2 extra buttons to say, call in team members. pulling off combos is pretty easy, from the basic BnB combos, to the more insane, difficult combos. but don't worry, it features a tutorial mode and a practice mode to get a good knowledge on how to pull them off, and experiment with your own type of combos.  It's a lot of fun and I had a blast trying out every single character to see which one is my favorites. however, if I had to be nick-picky on certain aspects of the game, well I can think of only one. that is the AI on certain characters. not the say that there's anything wrong with it, oh no the AI is fair and gives you a challenge, even for newcomers on the lowest difficulty setting. but for some characters the AI can sometime be a little unfair and goes Ballistic on you and KO's you in a blink of an eye.   That's about it really. I would recommend this game if you're a fighting game fan and wishes to try something new. it's addictive, it's fast paced mayhem and overall, an enjoyable experience. I hope there will be a sequel in the following future but until then, enjoy SkullGirls for as long as you like.  Thanks for reading :)",

The game uses a style that emulates sprite-like graphics because its all hand drawn, frame for frame. The music is good too. The only thing that hold this game back is the lack of characters; only 13 of them. however, DLC should add more in the future which can be both a good thing, and a bad thing since they are free for three months after they are announced.

(more or less)  Good: -Amazing character design -Fitting soundtrack for the stages, including the story scenes -Story illustration is well done, some scenes are wallpaper/poster worthy -Voice acting is well done and fitting for all the characters (Some voice actors will be recognizable if you've watched enough weeb entertainment) -Matchmaking for online play is quick and simple  Bad: -The character roster is pretty small for a fighting game -Not enough players are really online, so the good matchmaking just feels pointless sometimes -Certain characters can take up the camera, which ends up giving said certain characters a sight advantage -Can't modify damage, rounds, and/or time for online play.  Overall though, this game is probably the second fighting game I really got into and put a lot of time in. (Smash brothers being my first). I highly recommend this game if you're looking for a good fighting game that takes time and effort to learn. Take care! ",

The tutorial is fantastic, teaching new players basics of the game, in-depth tutorials of characters, and showing players accustomed to other fighting games the mechanics of the game.

I recomend it only because it can be interesting for same asshats, as people there... and because of boobies. It was funny reading start of all of this, but I was serious. This.Game.Sucks. Buy it only if you wish to have fun, playing with pals / look at nice art style / playing awesome story mode. If you wish to play with fair people in fair games - go away, you will never find it around this fairless crap.  Thanks for your attention:)   Now go away.",

My only minor complaint would be that the roster of characters is small, but I assure you that the charm this game carries more than makes up for it.

It took me a while to get some of the combos in the tutorials right, but it was good practice. The training room has a LOT of customization options for when you want to learn a character or see what moves can combo into eachother, so with a bit of practice even people who are unfamiliar with fighting games can learn how to play. I will say that the character tutorials don't come with combos, as they just explain each character's specials and unique features, but as I said before the Training Room can help with that. Bottom line is it's a LOT of fun.",

It pains me that Robo-Fortune was the last DLC, when I know the creaters have so much more up their sleeve. 2D fighting and anime, what a great combo together, and they didn't fail at making this game fun.
