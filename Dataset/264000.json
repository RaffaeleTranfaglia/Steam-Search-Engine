            "review_text": "A great Indie title which I have owned for a while now. From a fairly small team comes this title which allows you to terraform, use telekinesis and manipulate your environment to swing things in your favour! Multi-platform, extensive co-op/multiplayer modes as well as co-op story mode with lots of challenging levels and puzzles. Combine magical powers with your friends and make fire tornados! Who wouldn't want to be able to use their mind to throw boulders at your enemies' head?   Gameplay?  The gameplay reminds me a lot like Jedi Academy while the visuals and the feel of the game makes me think of Stargate, Indiana Jones and Prince of Persia. Not a bad combination! It forces you to think about your surroundings and the abilities you have to hand in order to defend yourself. Unlike a lot of action-adventure games, you don't wield weapons but have to use elements and take advantage of your surroundings. You can kind of use weapons, but not physically hold a spear, but take it from a Sarahul's hand (the bad guys in this game, like big lizard men) and throw it right back at them. There is also freedom to choose different paths as to how you're going to proceed to your goal. Are you going to go stealth? Go in blazing and take on an army of lizard guys? Flank strategically with your friends? Up to you. For an Indie game title, it's not as linear as you would expect. I believe there is roughly 12+ hours of gameplay available single player and/or co-op, plus PvP arenas and a few other multiplayer game modes.  Cool stuff, GADGETS!   Another thing which really caught my eye was the amount of gadgets you can use in this game. It's compatible with Oculus Rift (although I believe there are some tweeks needed), Tobii EyeX which is an eye sensor bar and finally, EPOC Emotive which enables you to almost literally control the game with your mind! Other than being awesome features, it really broadens the market to other avid gamers who may not be so physically able to enjoy games. Having eyetracker software, and being able to train your hardware to the thought patterns of your brain is truly astonishing. Again, I don't know of many Indie games that enable you to do this. So kudos to Stillalive Studios!   Overall?  Well, I can't be the judge of this game only you can. With anything I would always advise to check out some gameplay of something first and this would be no exception. I personally think it's a really cool little game and a bit of a diamond in the rough. The team at Stillalive have been awesome to everyone by listening to feedback, developer diaries to keep you up to date with changes and to give you a chance to express your views whether they're positive or negative. You can tell a lot of hard work and love went into this title and even if the game isn't your cup of tea, you'd still want to support the developers.",

            "review_text": "*Edit* I had an issue with the game and a dev responded in less than an hour.  Great support, great dev team, and might I add great game. Although it is hard to find players for multiplayer (game released hours ago so I expect that to change soon), the campaign is really fun! At first glance it appeared like moving sand was all you could do, but just wait, literal skill trees and several sweet spells later, I find myself really enjoying this game. The game has a lot more than the trailer makes it appear.   It doesn't have skyrim graphics, but who cares about graphics when the gameplay is this fun!  Love it.",

            "review_text": "EDIT: issues have since been fixed and whole game runs much smoother after a few updates. Still not reccomended to play with the Oculus Rift DK2 but on SteamOS and Windows is great fun.  **Original Below** I purchased this to play on SteamOS with a wireless gamepad (xbox360 controller), this experience was pretty horrible.   Despite saying it has full controller support you still need a mouse/keyboard to create your character and start the game. The game also seems to fail to register some button presses and the default keymap is completely wrong (ie instructions on the screen do not relate to the default button map).  I have also tried the game windows (with the same xbox360 controller) and it was a completely different experience. Buttons are mapped correctly and the controller worked perfectly. I doubt this game was designed with a gamepad in mind though as it still feels a bit clunky and my fingers were having to do a lot of work just to run,jump, and move the camera at the same time. Some sort of camera follow option might fix this.  That said once I had it running the gameplay seems quite fun, the plot is interesting enough and the puzzles kept me challenged at the right level  I also tried it with the Oculus Rift DK2 (I know its alpha) and found it completely unplayable as I could not get head tracking working. Based on the resolution it sets up I suspect this might be build to support the DK1 instead.  I still have hope that this will be a fun game however due to the controller issues I experienced I cant recommend it to anyone that wants to play on Linux.",

            "review_text": "NOT recommended. The controls are janky as all heck. By janky I mean that, holding a rock with Telekenesis feels like you're throwing spitballs, but pick up a character and it's like you're trying to move Mt. Everest. The story is contrived, with the writing on the level of something you'd find in your High School drama class. You're commonly thrown into sections with lighting so bad that you literally can't see what's killing you. You'll run into a bush that kills you in less than 3 seconds, while jumping off a cliff that would kill a mountain goat leaves you with barely a scratch. The camera finds wonderful ways of embedding itself in scenery and the levels are so linear they might as well be on rails.  There is some definite creativity here. So much potential. Given a good team, this could have been a great game. Instead, it's relegated to the bargain bin section, with bland textures, and character models so stiff you'd swear you're playing Han Solo in Carbonite. Oh, and the UI? Ha! Just wait until you turn on subtitles, and then realize you can't read them because half of what is said is formatted off-screen... then realize that the spoken sections, while admirable, is voiced by the same person, dozens of dozens of times...  Save your money for one of the other hundreds of fine games. Skip this one, you won't miss much.",
