            "review_text": "TL;DR: Labor of love, tailor-made charm, excellent action-puzzler platformer with a sense of childlike wonder.  Wuppo stars you as a fat little blob, exiled from your hometown for spilling ice cream across the floor. This frivolous beginning to the hero's journey conceals a deeper action puzzler experience -- like an archaeologist, your travels reveal the hidden history of your cute blobby civilization, from the ancient tribal wars to stone gods who came from the sky. Every screen of the game feels tailor-made, lending the game charm, style and storyline intrigue. Wuppo plays like a labor of love, resonating with the creator's admiration for the hand-crafted feel of similar style landmarks as Paper Mario. Particularly recommended for those who appreciate puzzles and platforming with a Nintendo charm.",

            "review_text": "Wuppo is a cute and charming game that goes against using conventional means of guiding the player, and instead requires you to be observant and to pay attention to what the enviorment and its inhabitants tell you. This causes the game to feel much more rewarding when you figure out how to advance. There are also optional collectibles in the game in the form of film strips. Even though they are optional, I highly recommend that you find as many as you can, as they reveal information about various characters and places in the game, and some of that information can be very helpful.  The platforming is solid, it has tight controls and proper physics on rounded bouncy platforms such as mushrooms. The combat is also good, although simplistic, with unique and challenging bosses that appear in the most unexpected places. The only real criticism I have with Wuppo is that if you're somewhat of a completionist like me, aquiring everything is a massive undertaking, specifically when it comes to buying all the unique items from all the shops. Grinding out all of the smurt (the in-game currency) takes a very long time, and the process becomes very tedious very quickly.  All in all, I highly recommend this game to anyone with an interest in adorable creatures, and games that reward thoughtful observation as well as good platforming skills.",

            "review_text": "So far so good! I wasn't expecting this game to be immersive due to its relatively simple visuals, but I found myself sucked into its charming world. I also love the music! Just in the first two hours I think I might've heard more different tunes than in other games.   I do think the platforming sections and bosses can be a little difficult, but seasoned platform players should have no trouble with them. Personally I would've preferred an 'easy' difficulty option.  Also hoping for a future mac release!",
