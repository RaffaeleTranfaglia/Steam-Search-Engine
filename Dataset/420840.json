If they hit your hand you lose. Simple as that. Super trippy visuals and sound. A must play if you like weird single mechanic games.",

            "review_text": "I wasn't exactly sure what to expect when I purchased this game, but it has exceeded my expectations and for the price, it is something that I think more people should try. Your goal is to get your 'blarps' to hit the numbered sphere to add an extra 'blarp' to your ever expanding cube. It sounds simple, but it does require planning and some thought of how you will use and manipulate physics to reach a numbered sphere randomly placed within the cube. The more blarps you have, the harder it gets and it can get really intense. If a blarp touches your wand (it's what is used to attract them and move them around) then it is game over.   Overall I think it is worth the price and is a unique game in itself for VR. It is definitely a game that is easy to pick up and understand and has the ability to keep you entertained for a good while each play session.",

            "review_text": "This is a ridiculously simple game but has virtually no lasting appeal for me. The title is kinda bad, the graphics in game aren't very stunning, and the gameplay is basically just way too simple.  So what is Blarp!? You start off in a small room with two sticks... one that acts as an 'attractor' and one that acts as a sheild. When you pull the trigger on the attractor, this rainbow eyeball flies towards that controller. The idea is to make the eyeballs collide with another rainbow colored target that then causes an additional eyeball to spawn, and the size of the play area gets a bit bigger.  Simple...right? Well that's partly why this game seems bad to me. You just walk over to the target... press the trigger on the attractor, wait for the eyeballs to head towards the target... release the button and step out of the way and repeat. Every time I got 'blarped' by an eyeball was my own fault for not jumping out of the way fast enough, or not releasing the trigger fast enough.  Also, eventually the play area gets bigger than your actual physical play area, but there's no real way for you to move in-game other than moving your feet for real, so basically whatever size your play area is, eventually this game will eat it all up and then 'hit a wall' literally.   Going by other reviews this was supposed to be strangely addictive or fun, but I played it for about 5 minutes and was already tired of it. I think I would have liked it better if I could have used the shield to whack blarps off into random directions or something, but instead the whole shield thing was pretty useless.  If you're looking for a fun game, this is fun for about 10 minutes tops and then you'll be looking for something better. You'll also probably not want to come back to it either unless you're so hideously bored that this looks interesting by comparison.  Things I liked about this game:      ... nope. there's nothing here.   Things I didn't like about this game:     too simple. It's about as much fun as hitting tennis balls against the wall.     Graphics are ugly     Sound effects are kinda lame too     No music.     I'll stop there... this game is just bad. Don't do it. Buy something else.   If you doubt me on the 'lasting appeal' go look at the positive reviews and see how much lasting appeal this had for them. Most haven't even broken the 1 hour mark. If this was my very first VR game I would be like 'OOH NEAT!' and then I'd get bored in less than 20 minutes. I should have refunded my money on this but I didn't.",

It's a game where you think about your physical body in the game's world, and your relationship to it.  Gameplay is exactly as it says on the 'tin', it's simple and unremarkable.  The best way I can describ is that feeling you got as a child when you played ball with a wall bouncing off the wall to the ground, back to you repeat, but the wall gets a little further away each time you catch it, and you want to see how far you can take this game before the ball bounces twice.

            "review_text": "I have to admit the first time I played this game, I didn't like it. I didn't understand it at first. The goal of BLARP! is to get the little eye creature (called Blarps) to the little goal spheres that pop up around the level. You attract them using your right Vive remote and try to swing them at the goals. You have a shield on your left remote to bounce them away. Every time you hit a goal, it spawns a new Blarp. There's a catch though: if a Blarp touches your attractor, it's game over. At first I was frustrated because I'd always get hit by a Blarp from behind me after making a few Blarps. I was so confused as to why people were raving about this game. Then I found the secret: how hard you press the trigger is how much you attract the Blarps. I was mashing the trigger and they would zoom at me. But if you just lightly press on the trigger, they come in slower and you can manage them.  After figuring that out, the game became less stressful and more fun. The gentle melodies of the music, the flow of the Blarps; it becomes very zen like. Its premise is simple, the graphics aren't crazy but fit well, game mechanics are well thought out, and it gets more challenging as it goes on (20+ Blarps gets interesting) At $3, this is a no brainer purchase for the Vive. I have a 2m x 2m playspace and a low ceiling and while I was cursing my low ceiling, I had a lot of fun with BLARP! and I'd recommend it to any Vive player. Just don't make the same mistake I did at the start and just let it flow nice and easy! Looking forward to the next experience from this developer!",

            "review_text": "I didn't expect much when I bought Blarp. After all, quite a few VR-'games' which costs three or five times more are just glorified demos. Blarp doesn't fall into that category though. It is indeed a simple casual game, but it is a highly entertaining one. It is neither scary nor violent and it relies heavily on fluid movements and precision on the part of the player, making it perfect for all ages, especially as the learning curve is extremely low : if you ever swung a shopping bag you'll know how to control your flock. As seems to be the norm for VR games : don't let the screenshots fool you. The game looks MUCH better when you are in it than what the flat pictures can convey.  If you have a Vive and at this (perfectly chosen) price, it should be an insta-buy!",
