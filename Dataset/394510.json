            "review_text": "As a fan of Alien Swarm, i really liked this game. It's a top down co-op shooter at its finest. Arrived at the scene, complete the objectives, then wait for extraction. Failed one of the objectives? Not a big deal soldier, get your ♥♥♥ to the extraction point and live to fight another day!  In this game, you are a Helldiver. You, alone or with friends or strangers, will be deployed to a planet, which you can choose, and try to complete missions in those planets. Each missions is procedurally generated and has its own objectives. Some of the objectives are specific to an enemy race, but sadly there are not a lot of variety on it. Everytime you complete a planet, you will gain some influence points. And then you jump to other planet, complete the missions, then gain another influence points. These influence points are important to take over regions, and when all the regions are under Super Earth control, then you can participate in an event, the final push to enemy's home world, to defeat them once and for all.  As you rise through the ranks to become the Admiral of Super Earth and helping Super Earth to regain control of the galaxy, you will unlock weapons, stratagems, and perks to help you eradicate your space adversaries. Each weapons and stratagems can be upgraded by using research points, which can be gained by getting samples while you are on the field, or by simply ranking up. Oh, and you can also change your appearance, by the way. Just saying.  Although advanced or modified weapons and stratagems helps (a lot), but teamwork is still the most important thing if you want to complete all the objectives, especially in harder difficulties. Even a Private can help a lot, as long as that person isn't dicking around. Stick to your teammates, move as a team, all of you must become a unit to be successful. Obviously the devs had this in mind, so in order to make all the players work together, they decided to lock the camera, so you and your teammates can't wander too far from each other. I understand and actually liked the camera lock, but sometimes the camera lock can be annoying since it limit your view.   As you can expect from the creators of Magicka, you will die, a lot. But if you are looking for stupid and hilarious accidental deaths, then you are gonna be a little bit disappointed. It's an accidental death, so yeah there is a funny side to it. But there are not much variations of it, and when sometimes in Magicka you can be overwhelmed by the combinations and you can accidentally killed yourself or your friends, in this one that's just not gonna happen. I guess i just expected too much in this aspect.  In terms of performance, so far so good. Constant 60fps. Never had an issue, no CTD, no sudden lag. Lack graphical options, but i can't say i expect more.   In the end, HELLDIVERS is a fun game. I had fun with randoms, and i'm sure it will be even more fun to play with friends. The upgrade system add a bit of depth, and the influence system made the game more immersive, although to understand it completely i think you need a bit of googling.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  TL;DR, A fun top down, twin-stick, whatever-you-call-it shooter. A great PC port, stable performance. Try Alien Swarm, it's free, if you like it, then there is a big chance you'll like this too.",

            "review_text": "It's everything I wished for. A game heavily influenced by Starship Troopers with a dash of Warhammer 40k and Halo ODST, along with the better parts of Magicka.  You can really feel the camaraderie with your fellow Helldivers as you push through the map, taking out patrols faster than they can react. Even when everything goes south, it's a blast. Getting out of a dire situation with only you remaining, running as fast as your little legs can take you, trying to outrun the horde of certain death right behind you, and then fumbling as you try to call down reinforcement. It's intense.  There's an absolute ton of variety with all the strategems, airstrikes and what not. Everything from calling down a nuke to a motorcycle. There are so many weapons to choose from, and they can all be upgraded. Albeit some are completely worthless and others vastly superior. And of course, you can change how your character looks, which is always appreciated. The only bad thing about this game that comes to mind is all the DLC. You essentially have to buy the game twice (or one and a half times if you bought that one pack) to have everything. Most of the vanilla stuff is better, but there are some exceptions.  I love it!",

This is a top-down shooter gem, much like Alien Swarm was. If you like top-down shooters, Alien Swarm, or the old Alien Shooter or Zombie Shooter games (which are also here on Steam!),  BUY THIS GAME.  Buy this for your friends too. The amount of laughter, anger, and good times is best had with friends. There've been a lot of times where I've died, yelled '♥♥♥♥!' then started laughing because it was in the dumbest way... like entering a fresh match mid-fight and without having ANY control, landing on a guy's mech and destroying it and him. Or piling into a motorbike, APC, or tank and getting one hit by a heavy unit... or drop pod... or drive off a cliff... killing all 4 of you at once.  Anyone that gives this a down review because of the DLC 'practice' obviously hasn't played games with bad Free-To-Play models or any game by EA that gouge you for every penny (Ever play Evolve? Wanna pay $15 for one monster?).  Get this game. The game is based around community goals so the Hell Divers NEED YOU! Dispense some freedom today!",

The dialogue is also very similar to Magicka (although there is way less story in Helldivers.) The setting is brilliant, it mixes Starship Troopers with (not very) subtle criticism of actual political events from 20-10 years ago. Also you can ride tanks with your buddies, mechs and order airstrikes for days. Boy this game is fun and I haven't even played 30h of it yet.

            "review_text": "Hello folks.  So anyhow I will try to be as short as possible.  This game is very good, the graphics are amazing and I have not found any form of performance issues, Except that you should not run this game in original fullscreen. Go with borderless or windowed or it will complain about drivers and want to revert your colour scheme to W 7 Basic.  So the game runs flawlessly and now I will head over to gameplay. The gameplay is fun, challenging and really gives that panicking feel when you are the only one left and a swarm is chasing you down in the deep snow. The game gives you alot of varietys when it comes to equipment and you do not unlock all of if too fast. I have 4 hours played so far, so not much but I'm lvl 10 and I'm loving every second. It's not hard to play with others either as the multiplayer is fast connecting and east to find games.  The only thing I might point out that will bother ppl after the first 10-20 hours hype is the mission system. It is really excellent, but it's risking of getting repetetive is there. But I have not made it that far yet =)   Edit: I've always loved games like Alien Swarm and such and if you ever played/play that game. (It's free) Then I will say that this game is even better, similar but better. it may not have such a developed story, but still it's not even close to as streamlined and you have to work together to a very good extent if you want to survive in the higher dificulties.  So far the number of accidentals that I see is sky high. Ppl just panick when 4 behemoths are storming your extract location ^^  Easy 9/10 on this game.  EDIT 2: 20 hours: Still in love with this game and I'm looking forward to many more hours spent. If I where you I would make sure to either find some friend in the game or bring your olds ones. That will ensure you have alot of fun. Game is still good in alone, and even possible as a single player.   What ever you do get the Digital Deluxe if you buy this game, it gives you all the dlcs. The price difference is 10 euroes from normal to digital deluxe, and all dlc cost ALOT more then that. Also it gives you a ♥♥♥♥ ton of new toys to play with. This is a very good game.",

HELLDIVERS is at first 'Magicka in Space' on the lowest difficulty levels, but as the game gets harder, you have to work together and take things a tad seriously if you want to succeed. Team coordination is key and pulling off a mission you've been struggling with is tremendously rewarding. The amount of unlockables allows for each person to specialize in their own little role and get good at something else.  The atmosphere is also top notch and if you enjoyed the movie Starship Troopers, you'll love the over-the-top war for democracy in HELLDIVERS.  Compared to Arrowhead's other releases, this one has very few bugs, none of them major. Gamepad support is also excellent (I honestly recommend a Dualshock 4, as the game was made with it in mind and works out of the box).  This is definitely one of my favorite games of 2015. I can't recommend it enough if you can talk at least one more friend into joining you.",

I've bought games far less entertaining from big budget developers for $60-$70 just for the base game; throw the $30-$50 season pass on top and wow this game is a god **** steal for the amount of brilliant entertainment you'll get from it.

            "review_text": "The original review can be seen @  Vox Ludicus - Review: Helldivers  [voxludicus.wordpress.com] , with images, formatting and captions.  ---  Whether I would enjoy Helldivers was a question that lasted the fifteen seconds it took me to deploy from my ship to a mission. I inexpertly chose to helldive in the middle of an objective – a SAM site I had to reactivate in order to help the war effort against the Bugs – and what that meant was the moment I came out of my pod I was swarmed by crawling insects, desperately trying to bludgeon and fire my way away from them before activating. I survived, because democracy must be brought to everyone.  Helldivers is a game version of Starship Troopers, to explain the sentence above. You are a highly armed, entirely disposable marine from Super Earth, whose job is to spread freedom and democracy to the melee-centered Bugs (yes, that’s how they’re called), the tech-heavy, shield-using Illuminate and the also heavily armed Cyborgs. You do this by killing them by the thousands with guns aptly named ‘Double Freedom’ and ‘Patriot’, all the while screaming one-liners like “FREEEEDOM!”. Other references to Starship Troopers abound in the introductory cinematic and the dialogue you can have with the other military personnel aboard your ship, though there’s no plot-depth to speak of – there’s a war and you need to win it.  From your hub you will upgrade your weapons and stratagems, change your perks and, of course, customize your clothes (Helldivers evidently wear capes, because why not), and once all that is done you can choose which enemy you’ll face and what planet you’ll helldive onto. The war effort is essentially a cooperative one, as each of your and other helldivers’ actions on a front add points to a bar that, once full, will allow you to besiege the enemy’s home planet and terminate him for the remainder of the war period (or if you allow them to push the front, they will besiege your capital planet and you shall need to defend it).  The missions themselves can be carried out by one to four people, with more helldivers equaling more and tougher enemies, and get increasingly hectic with both amount of players and mission difficulty. Arrowhead’s past with Magicka is clearly here: from the frequent friendly fire – you’ll often shoot your friends to death or deploy exosuits and turrets on top of them, spelling their demise, though they won’t be stuck in boredom for too long, as you can quickly and easily re-deploy them – to the key combinations that you’ll use to call in a wide range of stratagems, from fly-by shootings and tactical nukes to shoulder-mounted flamethrowers and motorcycles.  The objectives of each mission are varied and intuitive, and you’ll see yourself having to use your abilities in different ways as you defend an area for a set amount of time, escort a group of friendlies to an extraction point or search a small field for ordnance you need to disarm. The means to carry out these missions also increases greatly as you gain experience and research points, not only unlocking new weapons, stratagems and perks but improving said weapons and stratagems to further flesh out their uniqueness. I found the progression system to be particularly good, as I never felt like I was playing to progress, but rather progressing as a consequence of playing – the variety of enemies, planets and their hazards (from frozen wastelands and boggy swamps that slow you down to volcanic regions that spew fire) and tools to deal with them means you have to alter your loadout according to necessity, as each faction plays differently and is susceptible to certain tactics and weapons.  While it isn’t particularly good-looking, with relatively simplistic graphics implemented (likely due to its presence on the PSVita), Helldivers is far from an eye-sore, and once you’re in motion – deploying bombs and in gunfights – the lack of detail becomes hard to notice. The sound design, on the other hand, is superb: meaty sound effects and visceral noises play appropriately according to who you shoot and what you shoot them with, each weapon having a distinctive and recognizable sound that ramps up according to its firepower.  Helldivers is a simple game, but what it does it does well. With little down-time within and between missions you’ll constantly be in the thick of combat, praying that neither foe nor friend kill you, laying down democracy at whatever rate of fire your weapon has. A quick to join and easy to use multiplayer interface means your friends and strangers can easily drop in and out of your games, no hassle involved, and while you can certainly enjoy it alone Helldivers shines when  you’re shouting at your friend for deploying his tank on your head  you and your buddies help each other, frantically trying to stave off hordes of enemies before making a heroic escape on the dropship. And remember: it doesn’t matter if you’re panicking, don’t ♥♥♥♥ing friendly-fire me with your rocket launcher.",

The Resolution can be customized to whatever you need, the framerate seems good and the controlls are perfectly adjusted to be used with mouse and keyboard now.   This is Magicka 40.000 - Starship Troopers Edition; you get the franktic, team-killing heavy co-op experience of Magicka set in a star ship troopers (movies, not the books) inspired future rounded up with the magicka typical humour. Of course there is no magic and spell mixing, instead the frantic button pressing comes from interaction with objectives and calling in support drops (which you'll be doing a lot), those are done with WASD input string.  Unlike Magicka, you don't get a story campaign; instead you liberate planets by going on procedural generated missions to help the overall war effort; securing victory for Super Earth over the two alien and one heretic faction. The victories and failures of every Helldiver is collected and applied to the online campaign map with special siege and assault missions getting unlocked as the Players lose or gain supremacy over a system and either push forward towards the alien homworld or get pushed back towards Super Earth. Once every Enemy homeworld is destroyed the war is one, and you get a victory cutscene and a trophy, or Super Earth falls and you lose and you don't deserve nothing for that.   There is a progression system. For each mission you gain XP to level up your alter ego, unlocking new weapons, perks and visual customization in form of armor parts. You also gain new Strategems (call downs) by liberating planet and you can further upgrade all those weapons and strategems by using research points you gain from leveling up or collecting scraps of research related stuff during missions.  BUT there are some things that people might not like: - turning isn't instant, your turning speed depends on the weapon (or vehicle) you're using and if you're currently firing a weapon and what weapon. Some people dislike this sometimes sluggish feel, but I like it as a way to differentiate weapons and balance some of the heavy toys - you'll die a lot, and sometimes your teammates will be at fault or, even worse, you yourself screwed up. Some people get easily frustrated by stuff like that and this game is certainly not for them. - calling in Strategems and interacting with objectives can feel like a QTE, especially if you're doing it while a hoard of bugs is charging you and your team is all lying dead on the floor. For me (and only in this case) those add tension and challenge to the whole situation, others just get annoyed by that so be warned.",

I would say helldivers faster then you can say praise the sun. I love helldivers so much that I have it on my PC (thanks to a good friend of mine :)...yes I have it on PS4 as well.  I started play helldivers when it first came out on PS4 and got all the dlc before they became packs of dlc where you can get like 5 dlc's for one price. So here are some pro's and con's about helldivers.  Pro's  -Well for one..it take's skill to play. You can go guns a blaze by yourself but if your playing with friends/randoms you REALLY have to watch your fire. You can kill your team mate's if you fire at them. This is not call of duty ladies and gentlmen you can't be a lone wolf, you have to stay together and even if you want to run off on your own...you can't because you share a screen togather.   -Helldivers is like one of my favortie movies starship troopers. I mean yes you can say that's not much a pro but for me with the achievements like 'Next time we meet, I'll probably have to salute you' or 'You're it until you die or I find someone better' are saying from the movie and it make's me all yeah awesome and its a nice touch and it makes you feel the game was influenced by starship troopers. If you have no idea what I am talking about go watch the movie you will understand then :)  -Weapons are out there in terms of variety. You can have a gun that shoots bullets or a gun that shoots plasma/lasers. There is a gun out there that will be your favorite and you can upgrade them to so you really feel you worked hard on this gun and want to use it for ever.   -There is leveling in helldivers. The max is 50 if I recall and each level give's you more equipment to use and gavie's you more cosmetics.  -There is cosmetics in this game. You can be a male or a female and change your looks as long as your on your ship.  Con's  -In most game's you will run into that one guy who is a ♥♥♥♥. I was playing not to long ago today and a ran into this one guy who attacked my walker and I had to kill him in order for him to stop. It will happen that you run into that one ♥♥♥ hat but just keep an eye on them and just stay away from him.  -As from what I can see there is no new dlc. They update to fix bugs but other then that there is nothing new really. I have herd here and there that there working on something. It could be helldivers 2 but no one know's for sure. Just keep in mind that atm there is no new of new dlc coming anytime soon.  -Helldivers can be hard and that can turn off players. It's a walk in the park at first but once you go into the higher difficulties you could need some help from other players and even then its not 100% you can do it.  That's all I can think of really. All and all helldivers is the best indie game I have ever played. I it's worth a buy and it's alot of fun. See you out there soldier. For democracy!",

You are a Helldiver, an elite strike team member, trained to launch from an orbiting battleship in a Hellpod and to rain death on the alien enemy scum.   Your strike team will consist from 1-4 helldivers, depending on how many players join the game, and the action takes place in one single screen that scrolls with the squads as you complete objectives in missions.   You will be facing a cadre of faitly typical enemies. Bugs that are of the typical aliens/starship troopers variety and remind of Zerg, Cyborgs hellbent on 'improving' themselves trough modifying themselves and Illuminate, an advanced alien race using shield and stealth tech and energy weapons. These all have their individual weaknesses and strengths which adds some tactical element to the game in form of loadout selections.  Speaking of loadouts, you are not left wanting in variety. Assault Rifles, Anti-Tank Rifles, Battle Rifles, Grenade Launchers, Laser Rifles, Machine Guns, Plasma Cannons, Railguns, Rocket Launchers, Shotguns, Sniper rifles, Tanks, Mechs, Drones, Automated Turrets, Decoys, Supply Drops, Air Strikes, Orbital Bombardments, Tactical Nukes, Jetpacks, Personal Shields, Mine Fields, Strafing Runs and all sorts of goodies. Some of these come in form of stratagems or calldowns in other words. You hold down a key and perform a key sequence to dial the item, drop your beacon and wait for a few seconds.  Which brings me to the interesting part. You perform battlefield actions such as interacting with objectives and using calldowns by using keyboard combinations such as up-up-down-down-left-right-left-right, which completes a sequence and does what you request. This is sometimes nerve-wracking as you try to call down the extraction pod and enemies are getting closer to you, which adds quite a lot to the excitement.  Death can come in many forms on the battlefield. A bug chewing your face off, A cyborg burning you to a crisp. Or the most likely cause of death: A careless teammate mowing you down from behind with their machine gun by accident. Death in this game is not permanent, and you can always be called back into the game with a reinforcement calldown, and the action can continue. It is not worth getting upset about. Dying in this game is very easy. Ger overrun by a tank, wander under the landing zone of a shuttle/supply pod, falling into lava and so on.  The game has community-based star campaign progress which resets and begins anew when a 'war' ends (20-30 days). During these campaigns you unlock and upgrade better arsenal such as better tanks, better mechs, bigger guns and tactical nuclear strikes to lay waste to alien scum.  The community for this game has been quite nice so far what I have seen. There is also a commend/report system will ensure that griefers and rude players who get a bad standing will only get to play with other bad players, and well behaved and nice players who get commended by their comrades get to play with other nice players which is a nice touch. The bad reputation is not permanent so if you end up with a bad standing you can eventually get back to the good side if you change your ways and don't get more reports for a while.  Would I recommend this title? Yes, I would. Definitely worth grabbing on a sale.",

But I personally didn't enjoy it. And if you are also a casual gamer looking to play this game with a couple of friends on your couch every now and then, it might be not for you either.  The main problem is that it's stressful. Every mission feels like a survival marathon with enemy troops running at you constantly. I absolutely hate the 'alarm' system. If you don't clear certain enemies off the screen fast enough, they call an alarm which spawns more troops. This is nothing new, in many games you have these 'necromancer' type of enemies but usually those are rare, easy to kill or take a lot of time to 'summon' more enemies. But in Helldivers, the most basic troops call for help constantly. Yes, we (my coop partner and I) sucked at this game. And yes, I believe that once you get the hang of it, you'll be able to kill those guys before they call for help, but I don't like this mechanic.  Compared to Magicka, you can't goof around in this game. If you kill your team mate (accidentally, of course! :)), you'll have a problem (and he'll probably be angry). In Magicka, if you do those kind of things, you simply die (laughing hard) and respawn at the last checkpoint. In Helldivers you'll have to go through several 'Mission Summary' screens until you can finally restart the whole mission. That's frustrating.  And regarding the 'stress': Stress can be very exciting in games. One of the best examples is L4D. There's nothing better than yelling 'Get out of there, now! I'll hold them off! RUUUUN!' at your team mates and getting out of a tight situation (or maybe not). But then you'll have time to breathe again, scavange for items and simply blow some heads off from zombies standing idly at the wall - you know - relax a little.  Helldivers is constant action, and keeps you challenged all the time. It always requires you to do several things at once without giving you some time to breathe.",

But honestly I have trouble even continuing playing knowing that the developers have no intention of continuing to develop and support the game.   Yes they roll out very small bugfixes and patches every so often, and they released a silly gun and some capes for 'Liberty Day' this past month and a new shotgun back in march I believe, but they have explicitly stated that they will not be adding new 'content' of any sizeable measure. This means new enemies and planets. And while the game is very fun, with gameplay that cannot be found in any other game, all this potential is being wasted by developers who refuse to continue to support the game.   This is especially sad since the game has been criminally underrepresented due to a lack of advertising. The game deserves to be popular; the gameplay is incredible. With some substantial content updates and advertising it would be a game that would last for years and years with a devoted, hardcore player-base. Why can't they add new content though? A recent statement by game designer Patrik in response to a reddit post asking 'Will be there any chance to add new monsters/boss?' said 'Probably not, we are starting to reach the technical limits of some of the consoles.'  So, because this game was ported from consoles, the PC version is getting shafted. No more content worth speaking of. And the player-base is dwindling because of it. So while I'm not prone to advise people against buying games because the games are dead and/or dying, I fear that this one will be irrelevant in no-time because the developers are moving on and leaving Helldivers in the dust. And it makes me incredibly sad, as experiencing this gameplay was phenomenal. It was something that I wanted to master and share with a large, thriving community for a long time to come, and to be excited about when I could have new content to introduce new challenges and possibilities to this incredible gameplay. It's a shame, but I can't recommend the game. Especially not at this price tag with developers who are jumping ship.",

From massive lasers, orbital strikes, minefields, and healbots to gigantic exo-suits and 4-man APCs, you can go about the missions with almost any team-based playstyle you can imagine. The game's real ace is the friendly fire mechanic that demands tight co-operation between players and delivers a level of controlled chaos like no other shooter before it. Simply a fantastic game and VERY highly recommended:  9/10 *  * I'd give this game an easy 10/10, but for a rather weird 'global war' mechanic it has that I find detracts from the game. Every game you play contributes to an on-going global war which is fought on 3 fronts, against the 3 main enemy types. If one of those fronts is conquered, that enemy type is shut out of the game completely until the war ends. In practical terms this can mean 1/3 (then 2/3) of the game's content can be locked away from the player for days on end (wars can take 20 days with one front being won on day 12, so that's 8 days with 1/3 of the game unavailable to you). So be warned. I think it's a really bad mechanic in an otherwise simply amazing game.",

Friendly fire is always on, and you can even crush your fellow Starship Troopers with your pod as it comes down. Planetary missions can quickly devolve into a risky game of 'Tag, you're it'. It's even MORE fun if you make a drinking game of it. Anytime someone dies from friendly fire, take a swig. Got crushed by an incoming pod? Drink. Fell off the map to your untimely death? Down the remainder of the bottle.  It takes a lot of coordination, but once you get the feel of the game, it gets easier. There is a wide array of weapons, skills and stratagems to choose from. Prior to a mission, you choose your loadout, including both primary and secondary weapons, perks, and the all important stratagems. Stratagems are player activated skills that are on a cooldown and are limited in number, but can be extremely powerful. From free-firing turrets to mechs, strats are almost a necessity in order to complete the more difficult missions.  If you decide to purchase this fine game, do yourself a favor and pick up some of the DLC, because you're likely going to need them. They add much needed firepower to your Helldiver.  The visuals, sounds and gameplay are terrific, but there is a reason it's labeled as hardcore: It can be very difficult unless some strategy is used between loadouts. Also, you can't just go off on your own when playing with friends - because there is one camera view and all Helldivers have to be on the screen. It can be annoying, but it makes the game that much better, because it ramps up the difficulty. You have to be aware of your fellow 'Divers and just where in the hell they're shooting.  I picked this and all of the DLC packs up when they were on sale, and so far, it's been worth every penny.",

You and up to three others drop on a planet, complete a couple objectives, then extract, all while fending off waves of enemies. It's great for the first hour or so, but gets incredibly repetitive, as all the objectives blend together (effectively, dash to this location, then do a quicktime event, then dash to the next). As for strategic objectives? There's a galactic map where you choose to fight one of three enemies, eventually pushing back to that enemy's homeworld. The end objective is to win the three separate wars with 'Community Event' assaults on their individual homeworlds. Unfortunately, the devs forgot to, y'know, balance that 'Community Event.' 48 hours to get 7.5 million points, when a group of 4 people can get about 12 points for the toughest mission, which takes ~20 minutes? Do the math; there isn't anywhere near the playerbase to support that. So, the 'Community Event' fails, and we're back to an endless slog.  It's a cute idea, and has potential (especially given the Starship Troopers vibe they're heavily going for), but not worth $20. Maybe $5 on sale. Doesn't help that it seems to be a vehicle for distributing DLC, what with the bunches of special packs that give you overpowered weapons.",

The friendly fire makes you need to watch out for your allies as well as foes. Enemies have decent varity, with three factions each with different styles (at the time of writing I havent fought the Bug faction). The only dissapointing feature is that it the game wants to focus on Community Goals, which can lock out missions for other factions as you attack and defend nodes. The upside is that this keeps the queue times down. There are also abilities that are locked and need to be obtained as mission rewards, so the game will keep completionist up for a long time.

Watching the shuttle coming down as the last guy left tries to call you back to the field only to have the shuttle land on them before they finish is the funniest thing ever. Of course we lost but what a loss!   There is so much detail packed into the graphics. From the shadows and lighting (which I think are very well done) to being able to count the number of missles left in a support pack or your walker mech. The details are just everywhere and I think they help make the game just that much better. You can see what's going on. You know when you make a mistake and just how close a thing it was.   Everything can kill you, especially your teammates. The gameplay is brutal but fair. The game is about achieving objectives, not killing enemies. The rewards are quick to come in the early levels but you absolutely have to work for it in harder levels. Voice over comms tend to work good and the chat does well by color coding the messages according to who is in which position.   There have been a couple minor bugs, once I couldn't get back in a walker I had exited to help a comrade. Once it was only an audio glitch that kept occuring till the end of the match. Neither has happened more than once. This game has been running like a champ. I have nothing to say about it being a PS4 port. You can only barely feel the controller based UI. Mouse and keyboard controls work great. And while I have a controller I prefer the M+KB. Bonus points for anyone being able to grab that controller and join me playing right there in the room. It's like an arcade game that anyone can just join in on.   This has been so much fun for me. Helldivers scratches those itches that FPS wargames never do. I always prefer coop over pvp and Helldivers is coop at its best. 10/10",

Take this game seriously, and like many out there, you will find a number of skills that you can reapply towards the real world...to some extent of course.

Interesting idea when it come to the intergalactic campaign (basically, you and all the other players in the world are liberating the universe from aliens) very solid gunplay, stratagems (calling drops from the sky which from a gameplay point of view, means frantically entering combinations on your keyboard while avoiding enemies) and so forth.

You get great community driven weapons and stratagems (call-ins) to aid in your fight to liberate and spread democracy throught the galaxy.  Teammates who are quick to place blame and get mad the second you do something wrong can make the game hard to enjoy, but joining a match is simple and easy and playing with friends is awesome too!

We were doing well, having completed half the objectives.   I got lazy, didn't bother aiming away from my friend, killed him in order to take down an enemy. I was suddenly overwhelmed and had to run for my life, abandoning my friend's equipment in the process. I ran into a swarm of enemies and went down. Thinking all was lost due to my laziness I quickly tried to summon the reinforcement stratagem. As the bugs finally killed me I saw with relief the stratagem reinforcement ball fall from my lifeless hand, summoning us both back.  Once on the ground we got outta Dodge, and managed to complete another 2 objectives. Suddenly, a third friend of ours drops in for the final few objectives, helps us win and gets the bug cape for 15 min of play.  10/10 will try and jump into the last mission on someone else",

Your first jumps really make you feel like a badass, and the emphasis on teamwork to pull you through incredibly hectic missions is just awesome. The weapons feel great to use, the methods to accomplish objectives feel very interactive and hectic as you're being assaulted on all sides, the stealth mechanic in eliminating enemy patrols before they can sound an alarm gives you good variance to how missions can go. The shared galactic campaign is pretty neat too, with all players' efforts in various helldives resulting in points toward campaign objective completion (rewarded more influence in the campaign for harder dives than easier ones).  The only thing that really holds back this game on PC right now -- and it really does -- is the matchmaking. It is utterly atrocious. Sometimes you'll only see 2 games to join in the matchmaking list (even if you don't have a planet selected and it should include everyone from your region). Most of the time you won't be able to join on anybody you select -- at least it has been true for me that connections to the great majority of games in the matchmaking list fail, and I often spend just as much time trying to get into a squad with someone as I do actually playing. Not to mention that you can often drop connections right after missions are complete so you don't remain in multiplayer for the next mission either and have to find a NEW squad to join in on. No other game I play comes close to networking and matchmaking problems this poor. When it does work, it's -- again -- pretty great. This is a really neat game, and I was close to recommending it anyway, but even at $20 I just cannot honestly recommend it until the horrific matchmaking issues are completely solved.",

Music, voice-over, gun and environmental effects are all adding to an even greater and more intense atmosphere.  Helldivers is well balanced, fun as hell, fast paced so why not 10 out of 10, interface and controls is a mess, Helldivers is a fast paced game, in my opinion, the controls asks too much of the user, too often i found myself clicking wrong buttons or failing to execute my special abilities, which is not only frustrating but also in the way of properly enjoying the mechanics of the game, Helldivers is very unforgiving.  In Helldivers you control your character via WASD and shoot with the mouse (PC, keyboard+mouse setup), this works okay, but the game fails to properly show on screen where your mouse is, include the slow rotation of your character and you find yourself, too often obliterating your teammates, while shooting in the opposite direction as expected, extremely frustrating to say the least. on top of all this, Helldivers uses a sequence system to call for special abilities, while the system works great for activating in-game objectives, it's in the way as a control scheme, i would much rather see the traditional rpg-style using keys 1,2,3,4... the controls in Helldivers are simply too over-engineered, luckily they could easily change this if they wanted ;).  despite the controls there are a few other annoying issues with Helldivers. - the map is clumsy integrated, need overlay map and arrow pointing to next objective. - you can't skip dialogues, in the beginning there's a lot of them. - way to aggressive DLC scheme, the game is expensive enough as it is. - slow progression, grinding feel to it. - the end stats screen takes forever to count points and you can't skip it.  Despite this, the game is solid fun, you absolutely feel the amount of work and dedication put into this game, but i am concerned about it's repetitive nature, already after 5-6 hours of play, i feel im doing the same over and over again, this may hurt the replay-ability, the game is easy to jump into, matching is fast, so it may end up on the 'i got 10 min for action packed fun' shelf together with Broforce and infested planet.  i sincerely hope to see expansions or a Helldivers 2 :)",

The sense of humor in the game is also quite great, plenty of satire, more than a few digs at the 'Murica stereotype, and an amazingly ♥♥♥♥ed up backstory with a fair amount of lore. As for the DLC, most of the things in the packs are no more powerful than things you get right away, the first shotgun proving that a lot of the DLC weapons could be overlooked unless you prefer their appearance.

If you deploy a turret, it can crush you as it lands, or shoot the hell out of you once it does.  It's pretty buggy, though. Cyborg tanks will sometimes spawn on screen (sometimes wedged in rocks too) and instantly sound the alarm. Sometimes you lose all control of your character. Sometimes the camera decides to take the day off and go for a walk without you. Sometimes your strategems will decide the nice open field you deployed them in isn't clear enough, and instead decide to deploy on top of you instead.  And then there's just some poor design choices, like when an enemy tank spawns right next to the objective and drives onto it, instantly destroying the objective before you could possibly do anything about it. Or the way enemies off screen can sound the alarm before you can see them. Or the way the UAV and all-terain boots (arguably two of the most useful pieces of gear in the game) are locked behind DLC.  But in the end, it's fun. It will probably infuriate you every now and then because of how buggy it is, but it's fun nonetheless.  UPDATE: The above still stands, but be warned, there is a very, very poorly designed system that could make the game terrible periodically. Basically there's a war system, and if you want to play near the end of the war, you're pretty much locked into only a few levels with no rewards. It's awful. If you just want to play the game and unlock some gear, it's literally impossible. You just have to sit it out and wait for the war to end.
