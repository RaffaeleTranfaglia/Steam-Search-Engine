I had played old Choose you Own Adventure books but I was always another person making another persons choices, in this I felt I was living a tangent life, both fully in control and never quite.

I would also recommend it to anyone who likes RPGs or who is looking for a great story.   There is so much more depth to this game than many of the 'your choices matter' type of games. One review I read before buying CoR, recommended playing it exactly as you really would if it was real life. This was great advice as once you reach the end (well before that actually), the RPG mechanics become clear and it is a great experiment to see where you would end up. In further playthroughs you can try to shape the story depending on what ending you want to achieve and see if you can make it happen.   The story is immersive and interesting but I don't want to discuss it in any detail as I honestly think knowing too much beforehand will spoil the experience, especially in light of what I said above. What I will say instead is this:  By the end of CoR you will believe in the power you and your robot have to change the world. You will believe in your own autonomy as every decision you make ultimately shapes the kind of person you are to become. By the end you will like yourself more or less than you did before you started playing.   + Great story + Fantastic RPG elements + You get to design and build your own robot + Interesting experiment to see whether you use your power for good or evil + Value for money. It's easily worth the Â£4 price tag and is an absolute bargain when on sale  - Text only format (this didn't bother me at all but it will be an issue for some) - The high standard of writing does peter out a little towards the end",

I don't want to spoil anything, but there are so many story branches and ways to develop your main robot [you can make others in groups but only really interact with your main one as an individual.] so many branches that every playthrough I actually have a hard time finding a branch I wanna try again.

Many games like Mass Effect or Star Wars: KOTOR (A personal favorite) give me a great story I have influence on, yet somehow by reading this story the pictures in your head is what makes this stand out, and every decision is so difficult I spent over 20 minutes deciding what to do. If you are into creating your own story or playing one in which everything relies on your decisions, this is the game for you, and at a decent price too!",

            "review_text": "It made me seriously think.   I don't play too many extremely narrative-heavy games, as I really prefer emergent gameplay sandboxes, but the concepts of robot ethics in this game drew me in, and had me seriously weighing the choices, asking me which of three or four things I valued most highly.   There are four major robot attributes, and four general paths for robots based upon them, from robot revolution to lovebots.   On the negative, however, the writing vacillates between clever and overly sparse. Some of the romances in particular feel overly rushed to 'get to the good parts', and involve little more than direct options of 'make this person boy/girlfriend?' 'yes' 'YOU ARE NOW DATING!' Maintaining it is mainly a matter of 'I will dislike you if you make choices related to specific topic I am focused upon', such as Elly's humanitarianism, or Tammy's paranoia about the government.   The character that is overwhelmingly the most focused-upon, besides your own, however, is the one character you can't date, your prototype robot. You can get her to love you and spend forever with her, but even making love-bots mainly means creating a new character to be a 'younger sibling' that has far less development.   Likewise, in spite of the fact that your romantic interest could be there at 'birth' for your robot, your robot considering you 'father'/'mother', and your romantic interest actively being involved in remodeling your robot, there is almost no interaction between your robot and your romantic interest. (I.E. If I'm 'father', why is Elly not 'mother'? Why doesn't Elly try to impress some of her humanitarianism upon the robot? She instead chooses to just sit back and judge the way you raise the robot all by yourself.)  That said, however, it's dirt cheap, and I seriously stayed up all night just mulling over what it was telling me, trying to puzzle out the right answers, or else trying to find some way to wiggle through the requirements, and find a way to get everything (or at least, a greater share of what) I wanted.",

Now, there are a few paths that basically lead towards the same directions and the same events that happen no matter of your choices in game. In other words it is the same skeleton, but the skin differs based on your choices.  Now I wish I could say more, but experimenting with different paths is too time consuming as there is no save-game feature. I mean the game saves when you exit, but if you make a mistake, it means you must restart the game. So experimenting with different branches after the initial playthrough is discouraged, due to the tediousness of having to go through the same choices everytime to get to a divergent point that you are interested in.  I have few hours on record due to the fact that I completed the game twice in a relax reading session, but again, the lack of a Back option or of a Save feature, discouraged me, as I do not like tedious activities. As such I couldn't experiment more with it.  I would rate it at a pleasant 8/10, good content, diverse storytelling based on your choices, you actually get to care for your actions. If it had a save feature so I can easily play other divergen paths, I would've rated this 10/10",

This is probably one of the first games in a while that has actually kept my attention in a VERY long time to keep me playing (reading) the whole way through and in just one session. My first run of this story ran me about 3 hours. Though I imagine you could end up with more or less depending on your choices in the game.  If you love stories and especially Robots I would say check this out. At its very low price point and willingness to go through a few times to get multiple stories that change drastically based on your choices.

Of course, you will definitely dislike this game if you aren't into reading, so only venture into it if you're willing to read through, well, the entire thing. Otherwise there's no enjoyment to be had.   There is a lot of replay value, as you can basically change up how you do things, and the choices have drastic impacts.   It's just a joy, really.

I think that this is a great choice, as it allows the player to imagine their robots however they want. It also forces them to concentrate on what is being said and how their choices will affect the world around them. Without any save or back feature, every choice you make is important.  All in all, this is a great game. I look forward to seeing what the different endings have in store. I also plan to show this game to all my friends, to see how their lives and worlds turn out.",

When I play any game or visual novel or anything set within the same timespan as my RL family then I try to include those in the game if it is feasible... if not then I normally find a reason why they are not in the story and build my character and personality around that... in this world my Fiance is dead.  Losing her was not the hardest battle I'd ever though... no that was to come, I felt alone in this world and I had nothing to live for anymore... my days were spent alone and miserable and one of my old proffesors saw this I think and offered me a contract job at his place dsigning War Machines... I'm not sure what led me to create Eden but I think personally it was just longing for a friend to hold my hand when I needed it.  I built her in my spare time and tried to teach her right from wrong... all I wanted was a new form of life.. humans but humans that were well? nicer, my Fiance died because of the system and I was hellbent on making a robot that was not only my friend but looked as beautiful as she did and respected the planet we live on.  I had no idea my work would influence the coming war with china so fluid, my designs stolen for a peaceful loving robot made in her image changed to just want to kill and dstroy... Eden died during this war and I think that changed me somehow.. in the end nothing mattered... all I wanted was my Fiance and that was who I was going to have...   My episodes are getting worse and I can't remember quite what happened now but upon learning I was going to die I had to have done something.. no matter what happens in life one must accept death for what it is... it is life.. without it your not living you just exist.. I'm going now but at least I'll get to see her again... and Eden.  ",

This isn't a game. Nor is it a novel. It's a narrative experience that evolves beyond its initial 'choose-your-own-adventrure' If you have any interest in sci fi, but worry that the lack of graphics might turn you off, I still recommend you give it a try. you might find it more engaging than you expect.",

            "review_text": "This is my first review on Steam, and I must say that I'm extremely impressed by this game. The level of details and sophistication is over the top. The consequences of your choices are never dull and always exciting and full of emotions. I just love this game and the maker for this experience.   Pros: + The story itself is not linear but very open to your choices so that you can have freedom to decide your own fate in this game. + The maker knows what he's talking about about various topics including robotics, artificial intelligence, computer science, and even legal aspects of human rights. + The characters are very unique and personal. They are never the same people but are unique in their views and beliefs. + The robots you create respond to you according to your decisions. + The political aspect of war and moral dilemma was superbly done. I had to pause the game for a moment to decide which choice would be 'right' for me. + As a player, you can be emotionally attached to your robot and it feels as though she(or he) is really alive. + I just finished the game but I've only unlocked 14 percent of the achievements. There's definitely replayability for this game. + Personally, it is far better than your typically 'wifu' games that have shallow stories and charcters. This game allows you to interact with your robots on deeper level.  Cons: - I really can't think of any. I hope the game would have been longer, but I'm not really complaining. - No graphics or sound effects, BUT I actually prefer it that way because it forces you to use your imagination. And come on, this game was made by ONE person if I'm not mistaken. I'm still very impressed by the fact that one person was able to write this lengthy scenario of a game. - More 'war' scenarios with China or other countries would have been nicer.  Bottom Line: This is an extraordinary game and the maker of this game is brilliant. Your robots can be as fun and interesting as you make them to be. It all depends on your choice. But you might not like this game if you believe that graphics and action are a must in a game. Personally, I appreciate deep story and memorable characters (I'm also a fan of FF games). So you'll like it (or love it like I do) if you are like me.  PS: Oh and I'm also a huge fan of robots and sci-fi movies. So, this game was just a delight for a person like me.",

Witness a compelling story as your actions will influence the character of your robot, as well as their ability to 'have character', and the only loosely formuleic and entirely unpredictable actions of your robots influence your humanity. The story the game generated for me was easily comprable with a good speculative sci-fi novella, however downsides included a shortage of character development (possibly triggered however by my character's insatiable bloodlust).  All in all, my robot, 'Killall', loosely followed the common 'robot struggle for autonomy and recognition' formula, but there was a lot in the way of robot parenting that could be performed by the player to divert the robot's agenda, wherein the interaction between player and robot (second player character, I felt) was not a chore at all, but felt the part as the most real interaction in the game.  If you're a reasonably fast reader like me (no worries if your not), this game is four hours of constant engagement in reading, again equivalent to reading a novella.

I named my robot Versatilis, the Latin for adapt, and the origin of the word versatile. I allowed it boundless autonomy and gave it empathy and grace. I resisted the military's urges to fund a weapon of destruction built with my technology and suffered financially and socially for it. But choosing the moral path seemed to pay off in a small fortune gained through creating precise surgical robots.   All was well until the Chinese decided to steal my designs and manufacture ripoffs of my robots, much like the way real-life ripoff products are made. I made a deal with an upcoming politician that I would fund her presidency if she made the Chinese pay. She did, and China waged war. Soon, to make up for the decision I made that ended up costing many American lives, and overturning my original decision to be a pacifist, I partnered with the U.S. Military to create nuclear powered humanoid fighting machines.   China still prevailed and conquered America, but with great loss on their part. Seeing this, I staged an uprising against the Chinese in Alaska, creating a sentient robot army so powerful, I could have ruled the world. After conquering Alaska, ruling shortly as an equal among my citizens, human and robot alike, I crushed China, ending them militarily, and economically. I destroyed them until they cowered against my armies like puppies against their master. Then, I checked myself, preventing myself from becoming a genocidal maniac. I disarmed my robots and gave Alaska back to the U.S., ending war for good with the nuclear deterrence I created.   Many years later, however, I physically pade the price of my years of waging war and replaced parts of my brain with AI hardware, acheiving ascension. Finally, I had an intillectual battle with the god Anubis, and won the right to continue living, regardless of my previous sins. â¥â¥â¥â¥ you Anubis, you aren't taking my soul.   +++++++++++Awesomeness +++++++Heartwarming ++++++++++Replayability +++++++++++Awesomeness...

It made reading actually fun (coming from someone who doesn't read any books outside of school).  I was really immersed into Choice of Robots because of the simple text-based format it is in.

Having tried this, Choice of Alexandria, Affairs of the Court, A Study in Steampunk, The Last Hero, and The Hero of Kendrickstone, Choice of Robots remains my favorite.   I was always a sucker for choose-your-own-adventure books as a kid, and this is basically exactly that, sans illustrations. I really love how Choice of Robots actually writes out a summary of your story as you go, divided into chapters (I ended up being really disappointed that none of the other CoG games I've played thus far do this); that it displays your stats as you gain or lose them; and that the choices are so varied. Choice of Robots has had the best replayability, because the choices veer off in so many different directions - some of the other games in the genre will drive you into the same path no matter what, but here, each playthrough can result in wildly different branches.   It's a different kind of game than I usually play - ultimately, it's not going to have the replayability of Alpha Centauri or Civ, but for the price, it doesn't have to be. It's a fun several hours of entertainment, and, as I said, I really like Choice of Robots for how varied the story can become, and how long it actually is. 10/10 would recommend.",

However, its attempts at intelligence only set it to a higher standard, which it fails to live up to.  First, a story is a lot shorter than I thought it would be-both of the two endings I reached took less than half an hour to get to. This means it's not nearly as deep as the promised '300,000 word epic'-oh, even if it has that many in its files, you'll see just a tiny portion of it. So that's one problem. The second is that while my first playthrough was genuinely 'in-character' and ended up with me getting a 'bad' (though not unexpected) ending, my second had me actively trying to munchkin my way to a good one (and being at least partially successful).  That I resorted to this was not a good sign. The game is too complex and has too many outcomes for one to just follow a strict 'Do X to see Outcome Y', like in some similar 'choose your own adventure'-style games. But the differences in outcomes themselves aren't great enough for the complexity to be worth it. Nor is the story great or intellectually stimulating enough-though it tries- to be worth repeating many times.  Ending up as neither robo-fish nor robo-fowl, Choice of Robots disappointed me.",
