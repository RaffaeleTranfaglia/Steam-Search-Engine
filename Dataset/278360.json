This is a first-person single player game where the aim is to make your way through obstacles using different kinds of leaps as well as your grappling device and rocket boots (you will get the rocket boots in Star Haven).  The game looks very nice visually with vivid colors and runs smoothly on normal computers; I believe you will not have a problem running it unless your computer's performance is ridiculously low. The fact that there is no multiplayer may lead to people into not buying it so if you really dislike playing alone don't get it. However, when you grapple (at least at first) you feel like a total badass and as the obstacles become progressively more difficult you feel a certain satisfaction once overcoming them.  The achievements are fairly challenging and you will need to master the game in order to get them which is a fun challenge for those of you that hunt for achievements. The gameplay lasted around 5 hours for me. I did not try to find collectables or interact with objects because I didn't know the game well enough so 5-6 hours is a good estimation of what the game should take at a reasonable pace. Overall, this is definitely a fun game even though it's offline so as I said, if you only like playing with other people do not get this, but i recommend finding it on discount and buying it off Steam because it is definitely worth the €2.50 that you will pay!",

I bought this just after watching the trailer, and have not regretted it for a second.

Overall my favorite moments in the game came from finding new areas, and learning how to move through the 3D space in each to see and get to everything. The difficulty can vary from area to area, and some can be quite punishing with several minute sections requiring near perfect timing and not offering any checkpoints.  Outside of those several spots though overall the difficulty and checkpoint system felt just about right and I was never so frustrated-dissuaded that I had to give up on the game and walk away.  Overall length is a few hours for the core game, and another few hours if you want to go though the various time trials/achievements. Given the relatively low price and indie nature, that was just fine for me.",

Well, additionally to that, there were some noticeable bugs and the 'People' you meet (pretty early in the game) are... well... ugly as hell. The graphic of the surrounding areas etc. is amazing (Especially because of the great level/world-design), it's just the character models (and animations). But well, why do I rate this game as good? It's pretty buggy and 'unfinished' and only pretty, you could say.  Well, first of all, this game offers amazing gameplay and an unique experience. It truly offers a journey, a journey in a new world, where you have to search your uncle. The story is good (but pretty predictable), the setting is very good, and the few dialogues that exist are at least believable. Except the last one, but adding information here would be a spoiler for the already short story.  Plus: This game offers options for speedrunning (Tracking your time and a level choice after beating it). Still, to be honest, this game is not worth 13 € in my opinion. Get this game when the price is reduced, or if you are into amazing experiences, or if you are a really ambitious type of human being.  All in all, I'd recommend anyone who could think he likes it, to get it, when it's price is reduced by 50% or more. This is an amazing game, but too short.",

The graphic is amazing as an indie game, except for the character mods. The story itself is not that fun, and the storytelling doesn't create strong moods. But it's a nice try. The levels are challenging, but the difficulty is not disgusting at all. And... I think it's way too complicated to be a bedtime story for a kid. 7/10, I do recommend it for it's a nice try of mixing narrative game and platformer up.",

(Sometimes your can't find where you need to go at all and have to take a leap of faith)    The textures for the people lie somewhere in the uncanny valley    The dialogue is bad. The english is awkward and the voice acting is off. It doesn't sound like real conversation. When people start talking it snaps you right out of the feeling of exploring.

You can take advantage of a power suit to navigate the five bizarre areas the story will take you to in the roughly four hours of gameplay.  The main beef of A Story About My Uncle is indeed Fred's power suit and the various moves you can pull off with it: you can jump to greater heights, sprint, resist great falls, dash in mid-air thanks to a pair of rocket boots and use an energy beam to hook upon certain surfaces and cover large distances. The game makes a good job and introducing the different mechanics gradually and offers a steady increase in challenge as you go on.  While the title does have a story of its own (and a rather good one at that) and introduces few characters to you, the interation with the NPCs is minimal (save for two major characters): what really drags A Story About My Uncle is the platforming and the tale is told mainly in-between the various sections. The game primary appeal is the scenary: the environment is especially rich in design and always plentifully detailed, reaching scenary porn more than once.  Apart from the main story, you are given a time trial mode and a hunt for collectables around the areas you visit, which unlock mainly cosmetic goodies.

The difficulty varies, it took me lots of trial and error (mostly because some of the checkpoints are very far from each other) at a few parts but it's not unbeatable. I didn't get any achievements because I don't care but they are all challening ones so people who like that can do them.

            "review_text": "A Story About My Uncle is a game that instantly popped out to me, when looking through the Steam Specials a couple of weeks ago. For $2 CDN, an adventure game with a cool gimmick? Why not?!  The game features a suit that allows you to 'swing' around very open (and beautiful, I might add) environmenta, similar to Spiderman. More features come to the suit later, but I won't go in depth there. The features seem to work very well, even on a controller, where moving your cursor around isn't easy. I found that I was stuck on some parts of some levels, but only because my cursor didn't move fast enough to reach the object with my beam and continue swinging. I'd imagine that this would be at least a little easier with a keyboard and mouse.  While this game does have beautiful graphics, very good voice acting, and wonderful gimmicks to keep users playing through the adventure, there are some quirks in this game, which can be fixed:  I found that, with the energy crystals that are supposed to refill your beam energy, some of them just didn't work. At all. No matter how close or far I got from them, they would not refill my energy. The option didn't even come up. This lead me to reverse-engineering the game's physics, in lack of a better term, to advance through the game in a way that I'm sure the developers did not intend the game to be beaten.  The ability to reach certain objects with your beam from certain distances are also inconsistent. Some objects I can reach when I'm extremely far away from, while other objects, I can't reach when I'm only half as far. This also lead me to just guessing and misusing my abilities, making it harder for me to advance through the game.  The ending. No spoilers, but the ending leaves much to be desired. I wish the game would have gone further; really expanded on what was given to the player. I spent around 4 hours on the game, and the game feels unfinished; like it's just a demo. A $13 (but on sale for $2) demo. It really feels like there should have been more to the story part, to at least make the game FEEL longer. After putting through several, strenuous hours of gameplay, you get to your destination, and it's all over. No going back. The added epilogue was nice, but it still doesn't make the ending any better. It just draws out the feeling of 'Is this really it?', which is very dissapointing.  The extras and unlockables are a nice touch to the game. Although I didn't even realize they were a thing until I unlocked the first one. I will most likely go back and scourge the levels again to find the collectibles to unlock the ones I haven't gotten yet.  Overall, the game was worth the money for me. A very good proof-of-concept that should have been expanded on at least a little bit more, but was still very fun to play in it's time. I would 100% recommend someone to get this game,, especially if it goes on sale.",

It's compelling and emotional and really hits you at the end.  But the game is short, and the replayability is low. And that's a shame, because this is one of those games I wish I wanted to go back to more than once in a great while. For as short as it is, $13 is probably too much, but it goes on sale often enough, and anything 50% or more easily justifies getting this game.

You can get past most sections in a number of ways. For example, you may just jump, or rocket boots followed by grapple to get to the same place, and most surfaces will allow you to grapple, meaning you're not aiming for one specific grapple point which would have been the only way to get where you're going.

The difficulty of the game is not very high and also not very low, there are obviously parts where you will get stuck and take a good 5 to 10 minutes to do something you could have done 1 or 2 minutes, but that happens in every platform game. It is not flawless though, some times you have to do something like press a key, and the game gives you no clue for that, and you just go around for 2 minutes thinking about what to do, and then the information just pops up on your screen, the textures sometimes bug and get green or purple and start flashing which ruins the immersion. The game is also very expensive for what it offers, I finished it with aproximately 70% at around 2 hours, but even then I'd say it is a very unique experience and worth every cent. Overall it is a fantastic game, I'd give it a 9/10 just because of the bugs and the price, I recommend buying it on a sale, I bought it for 3 dollars and it was completely worth the buy.

It is a nice little first person platformer indie game with interesting mechanics, like the use of grappling hook, a powered jump and a jetpack.  The story is quite simple and follows your character telling a bed time story to his kid which involves the narrator's youth existence and his admiration for his uncle. Much later, he tells that his uncle left and the narrator's character tries to find him! Quite basic isn't? Yeah, quite average!  The game is somewhat short if you just go from A to B without much exploration and collectibles gathering but I'd say it was long enough (got the game done in 4 h) as it is especially that the last level is ♥♥♥♥♥y at parts, where you have to combine every mechanics at your disposal!  PROS: +Good visuals, the environments are well done and impressive! +The game mechanics are interesting and gives you a sensation of 'flying' at times. +Decent ambiant soundtrack and voice acting.  CONS: -Minimalistic story. -Controls are unresponsives at time. -Last level is challenging until you figure out where to go since the path is unclear.  OVERALL: It is an enjoyable game until you reach midway, then it get's frustrating where you have to figure out the path the game wants you to go while making 'grappling hook refueling'. Aside for that irritant, the overall game was a fun experience!  RECOMMENDATION: I'd recommend to anyone seeking a fun, short first person platforming indie game. The story is the weakest link of the game but I still prefer a story in a game than no story at all!  RATING: 7.0 / 10  PS. A suggestion... crank up the brightness of the game since it is very dark midway into the game till the end.",

Particularly when I have to turn and 'grapple' a recharge crystal, and then turn back to try and keep my momentum going. The game supports gamepad, but at the more difficult bits I have to swap for keyboard and mouse, as even with those I'm struggling to be quick and precise enough. This detracts from some of the enjoyment for me. Still glad I bought it.  There's a story, but so far it doesn't seem to be anything particularly wondrous or unique.

The game-play is fantastic, it is a first person platformer with a fantastic “grappling hook” mechanic similar to what you'd expect from a first person Spiderman game, you will swing from place to place and eventually find new ways to get around, the game is linear, but by no means constricting, you can follow the path, but you can choose your own way of getting around the environment as well, in fact the game will reward you for doing so. The game is also very challenging, if you screw up you will not get much of a chance to recover, but fortunately the checkpoints are very generous and I never felt frustrated (ofcourse if you try to get the achievements I imagine you will go nuts as they can be absurdly challenging).  While most games have a storyline of “epic heroes” and “villains”, this game has neither, there is no combat at all and there really aren't any “enemies” in the game, honestly I found it to be a massive relief from all the violence from most other games (don't get me wrong though I still love those games but seriously, there are very few games without some sort of violence in them).  It is also not something like Gone Home either where there is very little “game-play” either. A story about my uncle is instead a simple story of a young man trying to find his uncle.... in an alternate dimension with a super suit that allows him to swing like it was Spiderman's birthday, deep stuff I know but it is literally a bed time story. Sarcasm aside it's a very sweet story, and one of the few games in the past few years to genuinely move me, there may not be that much dialogue in the story, but it is honestly just the amount that it needed. The game is very short roughly 2-3 hours long, which while very short, also has a lot of replay value (it's the length of a good movie and like any good game it left me wanting more), if you want a game with a moving story, great game play, beautiful graphics and an exhilarating feeling of soaring through the air, then I can only recommend a story about my uncle.",

Positives: Magic Grappling hook! Rocket boots! Great but simple story Loads of little hidden secrets Decent voice acting Pure fun  Negatives Ok, so it's not the longest of games.

This game is a platformer, where you jump and rappel incredible distances via a special suit left behind by your uncle.   The game's spectacular jumps combined with its story create a surprisingly sweet experience.    A Story About My Uncle's irresistable charm is established within the first few seconds of starting the game, and it never lets up. From the voice of the narrator to the scenery of the different locations you visit,   the game is both whimsical and peaceful ; it is literally like being told a bedtime story about fantastic lands and faraway places.  Equal parts beautiful, breathtaking, and simple, A Story' About My Uncle delivers a satisfying story.    It can be argued that the game's length is a bit on the shorter side, clocking in at around 2 hours to complete the story. Yet, this succinctness lends itself to the fairytale nature of the game, never overstaying its welcome in any one setting, and quickly wrapping up when the story was done and told.  If it is one thing I would like to point out to the developers, it is the scene involving the giant eye worm in the caverns. I loved it! While not particularly difficult, as well as being a very short aspect of the game, the atmosphere it created was simply fantastic and fitting. Just as the eye worm really represented the setting it was found in (dark, strange cavern), I would have liked the other settings to also have their own equivalents. For example,   in the final section of the ice caverns right before meeting your uncle, there is a massive frozen whale-creature at the bottom of the cavern. While its very existent is fitting of the surreal nature of the game, I would have liked to have seen more done with it.    Overall, A Story About My Uncle is a sweet game that caught me by surprise with its incredibly huge jumps and fantastic story delivery,",

The movement is easy to use and is easy to understand with puzzles and tricks to keep you moving and thinking. That being said I did have minor issues. It is awfully short at about 2-3 hours worth if you just go through the story, looking for everything and doing the chievs may tack on an extra 2-3 hours but is really short for a orginal costing 13 doller game. The enviroment has some problems either getting stuck in a really odd place, being stuck in the falling animation with no way out, getting stuck on an invisible ledge, going through some of the world etc. And some work with the models on the characters would be appreciated as I took the frog people as monkey people by their feet looking way hairyer than they were, and if Maddy was suppose to appear 'cute', she came off as terrifying. The voice acting between the nephew and daughter was pretty decent, but the dialogue between maddie and some of the characters were slightly awkward and rather forced. Other than that amazing game",

FULL REVIEW  Hey guys, so I saw some guy without a chin play this game with this hand, and some weird symbol, and said out loud to myself, 'Hey, that's pretty good!'. I searched far and wide, deep into the jungle that is  cancer  the Youtube comment section. I eventually found the name of the game:  A Story About My Uncle . It looked fun. I bought the game, months later, after seeing the name again. I thought I heard it somewhere, something about that LeafyIsBeefy guy. I clicked, and saw I was right. It was on sale. The sale was ending soon. I just  knew  I had to buy it. So I did, and I was not disappointed. If you get it on sale, you'll probably pay around $1/hour of the main story. It's very short, but those few hours were well worth it. The graphics are pretty decent, but the character models are horrible. Fortunately, most of the time you're going to be swinging around, not looking at frog people. I set the graphics to max with 2x MSAA at 1440p. Optimization was a bit iffy, but I averaged around 110fps average, though I was locked at 60fps for some reason. It was probably my GPU drivers. The entire game is some father telling his daughter about his adventure finding his uncle in a weird world as a kid before bed. 10/10 PCGamer cheaters  ",

The main reason i love this game so much is the art design and level design, the atmosphere and mood of the games levels were so well done that I was completely imersed while playing through the levels. Overall id rate the gameplay at 7.5/10 its very simple but yet strangely addicting. As for the design id give an 8.5/10, this game looks beautiful, esspecially the Star Haven level which i loved the most (10/10 being the best possible game ever). The only drawbacks are the story is about 4 hours long, and most of the achievements require a super fandom level of obsession to achieve.

Beyond that, the game is quite a relaxing and enjoyable ordeal. The story is pretty straightforward, a boy looking for his uncle, who has left him a suit with the means to do so. While the game isnt overly difficult, the mechanism it gives you for its puzzles is a nice addition to physics/momentum based gaming. There is also a time trial mode for any players who wish to hone their skills and race against the clock.   Overall I enjoyed A Story About My Uncle, but it does feel like the gaming mechanisms have so much more to offer than can be utilised in such a short game. I do still recommend picking this game up, although if you dont feel a couple of hours gameplay is worth the price, you can always wait for it to be on sale.",

The detail is immaculate and interesting. Although its a very linear game, there are times where you have to get from point A to B, but you can take different pathes finding a flow in gameplay that works for you. Some paths are more challenging while others are easier, therefore it gives you the option as to what route you want to take.  The only complaint I have is with the voice acting and character models. The voice acting is all over the place, sometimes I was enthralled by what the characters/narrator was saying, while other times I had to cringe at the long, drawn-out unneeded pauses. The character models really don't match the surrounding environment, which was kind of disappointing. The character models are bland and flat, with little detail and didn't necessarily feel like they fit the world.  All-in-all the character models and voice acting are relatively unimportant for the game, I mean the voice acting provides the story, but other than that its all about the gameplay, which this game has perfected.

What is awesome about the game is that you see how upgraded this game was (this game began from a class assignment), look for in youtube for the early version of it. You'll get impressed how Gone North Studio put a highly effort into it.  Now talking about the game itself. The story is pretty good, but for me kind of missed more about the experiments of uncle Fred and a bit more of Maddie could be explored creating more connected story what would keep more the players.  THIS DOES NOT SAYS IT HAS A POOR STORY, IT IS SO DAMN GOOD, just could explore a few more points.  The voices, this is where the game did take care. It fits perfectly with the characters. Soundtrack really is remarkable and brings the right emotions when it is needed. One of the best points in the game. You can hear the complete soundtrack at their website.  The gameplay is easy and sounds good enough with keyboard. I tried to use the controller but fast enough I quit because it was kind of hard to play with it. I wouldn't put the power jump and grapple over the bumper and trigger, for me it was difficult to play this way. While there was three buttons available 'B', 'X' and 'Y'.  In a few moments I got lost but nothing compares about how lost I could get through the ice stage. There was a moment where I thought: 'Holy s***! Is it really there?' and it was. This is why I could consider it kind of a puzzle game.  While jumping on a few platforms some bugs would appear where I got stuck or sometimes I could stop over something that really wasn't the platform and use it for my own benefit to restore my grapple.  I know that I've said a few cons but what everyone has to know is 'THIS GAME IS AWESOME!'. Bugs happens and can be repaired, but they don't make A Story About My Uncle look less than it should. It was not frequent for them to happen, they don't affect gameplay constantly.  For me A Story About My Uncle was a huge surprise and would totally recommmend for others to play because the studio deserved it. Great story and gameplay creating a new way to play games.",

The graphics are nicely done and it runs very smoothly with antialiasing and motion blur. Although it seems liek it was designed for keyboard and mouse, I had no problem playing it with an Xbox 360 controller.  The character animation underwhelming. There's very little of it in the game and if feels very mechanical. The character designs don't match the quality of the enviroments and objects. The narrator's voice acting and recording quality is quite poor. It sounds like someone's reading it off the page and whoever's reading it doens't have a lot of experience speaking into microphones and it needs some equalizing.

There's a few collectables that act as kind of a reward for traveling off the beaten path, nothing too hard to find though.  All in all, I loved this game and highly recomend it. Even at the $12 price. (I got it on sale for $2)",

If you're bored of western games' low difficulty and want some challenges, buy it.  - the game has no place for mistake, you miss a shot by 0.5milimetre after a long swing session? restart at checkpoint!.

The game seems awesome, but I've been losing way too much time frustrated over the lack of controls precision and smoothness. The limit of the grapple is excessively frustrating, and although I do acknowledge I'm personally not a very 'skilled' player, this is by far the most frustrating game I've played so far.",

            "review_text": "A very well-produced game. The mechanics and levels were clearly put together with a great deal of care. The atmosphere is excellent, and the levels are fun and challenging without being hard just for the sake of being hard.   The game is relatively short, only 2-3 hours on a first play-through, but I honestly prefer that in games these days - when your days are long and you have little time for video games, it's nice to be able to finish one in just a few evenings! A Story About My Uncle doesn't overstay its welcome. It doesn't feel either dragged out or rushed. For people looking for more gameplay, there are quite a few collectibles to give it some replay value if you didn't catch them all the first time through.  Each of the different areas has its own distinct feel and its own mechanic - everything from glow-bushes in the pitch black to stalagtites that fall when you grapple from them. The different biomes are well-realized, with attention to detail. The windmill village, especially, is quite lovely. The mechanics all feel smooth and well-implemented. They aren't necessarily anything extraordinarily innovative, but they feel fresh within the context of the game. It's not just some stale re-hashing of old ideas; everything fits into the game nicely.   The bedtime story vibe of the game is one that resonates with me. It keeps the tone light, even as a couple of the areas are rather foreboding. It moves the game along, keeps you engaged with the narrative, and generally provides an excellent backdrop to the gameplay.  There are a few things that I think could have been done better. The game could have benefited from some more attention to the soundtrack. I'm not saying that the soundtrack was *bad* by any stretch of the imagination, just... the ambient sounds were just that: extremely ambient without having any interesting melodies. I'm a huge sucker for games with a good soundtrack. Additionally, it would have been fun to be able to interact with and speak to the various NPCs. Just having some textual dialogue, even if it wasn't voice acted, would have been neat. It would have given the towns a bit more life.   Overall, however, I definitely recommend this game! I'd certainly buy it again. I don't think I'd pay full price, but if you see it for around $5-7, I'd say you're going to be getting your money's worth.",

Not bad, but also not great  - playtime (about 3h - 4h)   Long version: ------------------- This is one of my favourite games. To be honest the title of this games does not sound that interresting and the graphics might be a bit outdated (but still very nice in my opinion), but it's really worth it to take a closer look at this game.   The story is being told like a bedtime story. The character you play, tells his daughter the story about his journey when he was searching for his missing uncle and discovered a different world.  You'll find a suit invented by your uncle that let you jump high and far through the scenery. Also included in this suit is some kind of grappling hook that you can (or better have to) use to swing through this new world (and to use this, is SO MUCH FUN!) So now you start your journey, discovering this world on your way to find your missing uncle.  The playtime is really short. I finished the game in about 3 ½ hours. And if you don´t fall in the ground as often as I did, you can finish it much faster. But you will fall in the ground very often ;) Like I said it was a lot of fun 'flying' through this world, but there are many places where you don´t see where to go next at the first time. So when I was wondering where to go next, what I did was to jump in a direction and try if I can grab a rock or something else nearby. Aaaand.....what a surprise.....I fell in the ground ^^ But even if you see where the right way is, it´s often not easy to follow it. That can get a bit frustrating after trying the same thing over and over again. But this is the only thing that makes this game difficult, because you don't have any enemy to fight. And that's a good thing in my opinion, because that way you can really enjoy discovering this beatiful world and the feeling to 'fly' through the air.  So would I recommend this game? YES, absolutely. BUT: Considering the playtime of only 3h - 4h I would wait for a good discount to buy it.",

Story, game length and replayability   The game's story is interesting, and even though it's pretty short (according to steam, it took me 2.3 hours to finish the main story) and simple, you do want to understand what's going on in the very weird world the games takes place in. As stated above, the game is pretty short, but it does offer some hidden objects that give you access to new story elements and a race mode, which I haven't tried, but I personally don't feel like playing this game as fast as possible would be that fun.   Gameplay   The gameplay is pretty simple : hold right-click to charge up your suit, giving you a super jump on release or a leap if you're running and use left-click to grapple onto something. The way you make your way through the levels is prety unique and fun, but it does get boring fairly quickly. One thing that bothered me though is that you sometimes can't see the rocks you're gonna have to grapple to next, so you have to find them while in mid-air, which often end up in you falling to your death and feels a little bit frustrating since there's nothing you ould've done to avoid that death.   Other considerations   The graphics in this game are pretty impressive. It isn't the most beautiful game ever, but it does look really good. The characters are well made and the environments are really beatiful, especially when you're not stuck in a cave (which sadlt isn't the case for a very bg portion of the game).   Conclusion    A Story About My Uncle  is a pretty good game overall. I do recommend buying it, but I'd advise waiting for it to get on sale, mostly because it is pretty short. Next time you're home alone and don't know how to fill up your evening, you should definitely consider playing this. Finally, I highly recommend playing the whole game in a single session, as I feel like stopping halfway through it will break the immersion pretty bad.",

I normally have a lot harder time getting into the headspace of a fantasy game than a scifi game, and I'm sure there's a lot of players out there who fall on either side of that fence as far as preferences go. I snapped it up first sale after it was on my wishlist from just a couple clips of gameplay, not knowing there was a little bit of fantastical nature to the game. I happened upon A Story About My Uncle after playing Coffee Stain Studios' Goat Simulator and was curious about what else was in their catalog. Turns out they had published this game for Gone North Games, and now I'm in love with both of these developers.  The majority of the fantasy elements in the story are/are not explained away by the mysteriousness of the world you visit. What's happened in this land might just be scientific, and your method of travel and equipment are certainly scientific in nature. So what Gone North Games have done here is successfully blur the lines between a scifi and fantasy aesthetic without making it look like a Thor movie, and I applaud them for that. This is all made even more enjoyable by just how pretty this game looks on high graphical settings. For the gameplay side of things, I have not felt such fluid progress in a game since the early levels of Portal or first few tracks of Audiosurf I played. There is a learning curve as your suit grants and removes abilities throughout the campaign, but I can only think of one actual instance where I got stuck and couldn't figure out what I needed to do immediately. Even still, there is a difficulty to the game, in that you're running and grappling from platform to platform in the sky like Spider-man, except with a energy lasso instead. Later in the game there are clear paths for how you should traverse the level, but in several spots there were less obvious paths I was able to successfully traverse, and I appreciate the non-linearity of it all. ASAMU is not a first person puzzle game or 'walking simulator', it is a game highly geared around movement and staying mobile. The thrill of flying through the level and the close calls of almost missing the timing on some jumps could sell the game alone for some. The only downside is the length (~3 hours), though I feel the game puts you through its paces just fine before you reach the end. If you're looking for a fresh experience of flying around like a web slinger be sure to give this a look.",

The way how the player proceeds through the levels is pretty enjoyable too, and - as somebody said - makes you feel free as you fly among rocks, ice and fluctuating villages. The storytelling is excellent, it really makes you feel part of the story. The only things I would have liked to see are two: firstly, it would have been interesting to have characters interact with you in a more engaging way, as only Maddie seems to create a real bond with the protagonist. This may have been made on purpose, though, so to have the player creating a special relationship with her. In a second instance, the ending would have been more enjoyable if letting the character a bit deeper into the reasons why the ending was to be like that. The ending itself could have been pretty different and more tricky for the player. It's fine and poetic as it is, but a longer and intenser engagement with what was to happen would have created a better climax and would have impacted the player and challenged him/her into reflecting about it. As it is, the ending is way too fast to leave a significant mark in the overall experience.  PS: It also runs smoothly on my laptop, which is 2.6GHz dualcore and 4GB Ram, so not too powerful",

This changed as soon as i loaded it up, i could already tell from the music, the simplicity of the main menu, it was my type of game. I got in and was amazed by the beautiful scenery, the dialog made me feel as if i were living the game myself, and i was happily surprised. I wont say what the game is about other then that it really is an adventure, it made me feel wholesome inside once completing and although it was only a couple hours play time at most it left me feeling fulfilled and perfectly happy with the way it ended. The short time i played this game was just enough for me to really feel how the character felt and i genuinly felt the emotions of the character (or what i thought them to be).

I'll be honest I wasn't expecting much due to the price tag and that I had never heard of it before but oh boy was I wrong. Visually this game is stunning, the levels all have a tonne of detail and are very well designed. The backgrounds of each level in particular are breath-taking. In the 4th level I found myself dying just to have a look around! Not to mention that the soundtrack compliments this game perfectly, and you find yourself soaring around without a care in the world because of the atmosphere created by this game.  Moving onto the gameplay - it's fun! I've never been a big fan of platfromers, especially 3D platformers, but this game got me hooked and I found myself playing it start to finish from the minute i picked it up. The jumping physics allow you to truly feel free in the air, and the grapelling hook gives you a fine degree of control as you soar from platform to platform. Certain parts can be frustrating as it is very easy to overshoot a platform or just fall short, but with a little bit of perserverence you should find a way through pretty quickly. I found the waypoint system reasurring and extremely helpful as it can be very easy to lose yourself in the surrounding enviroments.   The voice acting in this game isn't great, and neither are the character models, but then if you pick up this game, chances are you won't be playing it for that. The plot itself is rather simple, esentially just being a hunt. However, the way that the story is told is rather charming and I found myself rather enjoying the narrators commentary as the game progressed.   My only other gripe is that the game is rather short, but then when you consider how much you're spending, then it shouldn't suprise you. What matters is the quality of this game, not the quantity and in that respect I believe it shines.   Definately worth picking up and having a go!",

The story is not what you think it is--there is a hidden story really buried that you probably would never notice. Once you finish the game, go read the forums and get that info--it completely changes the tone of the entire game. The graphics are art are just stunning although some might find fault with the character design (I don't). The sound design &amp; music are also superb.

There is a cute story, but most of the game is platforming and swinging around with your grapple. The grapple is so much fun, even if at times it can be incredibly frustrating...   + There is also a cheat system in the game, so if you really get stuck (or if a younger child/sibling wants to play) you can get infinite grapples.

The world is just beautiful (the foliage in particular) and as far as platform games go, the idea of this game is quite fun.  However, there are two main downfalls of this game:  1) It is extremely short! With only six levels taking approximately 15-20 minutes (if that) to complete the first time round. The majority of people writing reviews have completed the game in just 2 or 3 hours.  2) The game gets VERY repetitive very quickly; the gameplay is almost (if not) identical in each level and there isn't a large enough variety of modes to support more types of gameplay, multiplayer for example.  So if you love games made to look beautiful, by all means try this game out, but don't expect to ever play it again after your first completion of the game (I who have OCD about getting every achievement for every game am even struggling to find the motivation to play this game again for as long as it takes). But if you want a game you won't get bored of easily, has masses of content and you'll want to play for more than a few days (which is the majority of gamers), I wouldn't recommend this game.",

Let me start with a brief summary:  You are looking for your uncle, who has gone to a secret world, and you get a special suit that lets you soar through the world, take no damage from falls, and use a laser beam to latch on to surfaces and pull yourself through to them.  Pros: - It's done through the first-person perspective so at times it can be very fun, soaring through the air and seeing it fly past you. - The scenery can be very beautiful, and some of the backgrounds are lovely. - There are collectables, which, I guess, add some form of replayability.  Cons: - AWFUL, AWFUL, level design. There will be so many times where you will have NO idea where to go, what to latch onto, and what the hell you're meant to do. Not to mention when it's painfully obvious that the designers had no idea what to do and so just placed some random floating windmills in a weird circular pattern so that you could reach another random floating rock. It's very sporadic, some areas are wonderful, others are awful. - Not to mention, so many of the jumps and timings are pure luck, and not skill at all. This, compounded with the fact that you have no depth-perception at times, really ruins so many of the best and most ambitious course obstacles. - The worst voice-acting I have ever heard in a videogame. Straight up horrendous and cringe-worthy. It feels like someone with a foreign language recorded themselves reading the lines one by one without any indication of what the script is like, then made someone else re-record them with different intonations for the hell of it, then gave them to someone with no concept of language to record one last time. Literally so bad I muted my sound after just one level because I couldn't stand it. -Bugs, such as when you grab onto a rock and it pulls you too close, so that the character falls on the ground and you have to restart. Really annoying when you're going for the 'don't fall' achievements. -Boring replayability, because there's no real incentive to get the collectables or do the time-trials. -Boring story, which whilst cute, because of the story-telling to a small child idea, isn't satisfying at all. It's a straight-up reach point A from point B and the 'village' you are introduced to has no meaning, especially when the character you are introduced to from it just leaves the story halfway through and does nothing particularly important then on. You leave the village and it feels like a small glimpse into the actual story rather than anything important,  Overall, I think this game isn't worth 12 dollars, and I wouldn't get it. But if it's on sale, then do it! It's a fun little adventure that you can play when you need a small break.",

Unclear layouts leaving you wondering where to go, split-second timing over and over, jumps where you have to be pixel perfect to make the next hook, so so so many respawns, but never a feeling of triumph, just another impossible jump. It felt great, briefly, then it felt padded with unfair design. If you want some challenge, you might like it. But it never felt like 'fair' challenge to me.",

            "review_text": "A Story About My Uncle is a game made in 2014. It quickly grasped eager players and online gamers and held them tighter than a grappling hook shooting you 50 foot up above your designated area.  PROS: Beautiful Graphics and Style.  One of the best looking games I've played all year. I will defend this game for this aspect because of just how amazing it looks.  Unique Gaming Mechanics.  I have not played another game with the same aspect of this. Seriously, look up 'Game with Grappling and Super Jump Mechanics' and you probably won't get many results.  Smooth Gameplay.  (Most of) the gameplay was amazing and very smooth. Maybe it's just my computer but, dammit, it looks so beautiful!    Yeah.. Those were the ros. Into the Cons!    CONS: Uninterresting Storyline.  I'm sorry if it's just me, but it's hard to get invested into the characters and general storyline of the game. I could not get invested into the story at all. On top of this, it's painful when you lose the ability to do everything for a little 'cutscene' that takes a few minutes. What's the point of taking away our powers if we're only going to be talking for one minute?  TERRIBLE Window (Yes, this is very nit-picky).  Jesus, it was a PAIN to actually be able to play with this window. One minute the bottom of the screen has a black line across it and the next, I'm sat there watching the window go from 'Fullscreen' to 'Windowed' every few seconds.  Bad Grappling Mechanics. I don't mean the grappling itself, I mean certain parts with it.  First off, the reach for some rocks are extremely far and others are extremely close. Why is this? It would be easier to have them all set to a certain point.  Secondly, Jesus, it takes forever. It can't be just me who's having this issue where, one minute I'll be flying across the map and the next, I'll have my buzz killed because it takes FOREVER to reach where you're going with it.  Repeating Areas. I don't mean the areas repeat themselves, but I've found that.. It all looks the same. I see little to no variety in the surroundings or areas I'm in. The beginning of the game had a house, houses on the rocks, moving rocks, a village, etc. However, it pretty much becomes you jumping from rock to rock.    All in all, this wasn't a terrible game, however, if you ask me, I wouldn't really recommend it.  4.5/10",

            "review_text": "'A Story About My Uncle' is one of the most frustrating games I've played in some time. For a platformer that relies almost completely on swinging to do your platforming, the swinging feels terrible. 95% of the times I died in this game were because of the lack of control over your movement while swinging. It just feels clunky. Not to mention, I lost count of how many times my character got stuck in random objects in the environmont after landing, forcing me to reload to the last checkpoint... Which brings me to my next point. The Checkpoints in this game are terrible! They're simply too few and far between for a platformer with such unresponsive controls. I like the title of the game and the ending, that's it...",

From what I can tell, there's a lot of gravity despite how flighty the jumping and grappling is. That is to say, you fly up very fast, float for a bit, and then accelerate downwards very fast. It's hard to get a feel for it, especially when all the puzzles require fairly quick timing. A little too late or early and you'll plummet to your death.   It's a fun game within that, at least. The story seems forced and the narration is sporadic, but worth a play if you can get it on sale. Part of the reason I'm not recommending it is that is has such high reviews despite these problems--I think you SHOULD get the game, just not with high hopes for a masterpiece.",

The first person jumping and swinging and boosting is great, however there is one fatal flaw that makes this game more frustrating than it needs to be. Depth. Without a sense of depth, you will miss your landings, fail to lock onto the floating grapples, and fall into empty space. There was a point in the game, where the one improvement you get, that makes the depth thing forgiving, breaks, and the game becomes triple fold frustrating, so much that I had to just stop playing. The graphics are gorgeous, the voice acting is so-so, the story is basic. The lack of a depth scale, (even just a number floating next to the reticle), spikes this game's difficulty to frustrating levels. Real bummer too, because it is a pretty fun concept.",
