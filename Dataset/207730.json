            "review_text": "This game is awful. The camera is shaky and zoomed in way too far. Items are overpowered. Scoring system is terrible. Units are awkward to control and you can't have too many out at once. Maps are small and encourage placing units at item spawns to win the game that way. Unit abilities only work 50% of the time. Calling precision air strikes at the start of the match is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game mechanic. Payed 49 cents for the game. Normally i dont care for such a low cost but i kind of want my money back at this point.",

Build units, clobber enemy units and then steal and capture enemy resources. If you are looking for a short fast paced strategy game this one should suffice. It feels more like an arcade game than like a strategy game. Nothing special, but fun to play.",

RTS player and i love RPGs... sad File crashing kills my desire to take time away from other things. Only thing i expect is to buy a working game regardless of the price.   Fix this and for othere, wait it out 90% off ain't worth getting a broken game. Hit me up if you wanna wait it out and i`ll just gift the bloddy hell away.",

Gameplay is the shallowest kind of rts you can imagine with a taste of dota in there, multiplayer is nonexistent and singleplayer is so bad that you wish it was nonexistent. it's like a minigame you'd play in a far better game as a distraction. I wanted to give this game a chance, so I waited until I upgraded my computer to try it again. Turns out that this did nothing to help. No recommendation here. Just shame.",

With no tutorial to introduce you to the games elements it's like walking blind. It took me a good solid thirty minutes to figure out how to, upgrade a unit. There are many things wrong with this game, but look on the bright side, it's graphics are good. All in all, I would not reccomend this game.",
