    "description": "TORMENTUM is a dark Point &amp; Click adventure game.The dreamlike, nightmarish atmosphere of the game was inspired by works of painters H.R. Giger and Zdzislaw Beksinski. The game's final look and feel was also strongly influenced by the universes of games such as Demon's Souls or Dark Seed.",

            "review_text": "Guess I'm gonna be that guy, but only purchase this game if you are more interested in the artwork than the actual gameplay. If you are more interested in the gameplay, I think the game is overpriced.  This game is ridiculously short. My first game took me around two hours (probably a bit less, but I kept AFKing so I can't say for certain); my second game only took me an hour (I made the opposite choices as the first game and skipped all previously read dialogue). If you're an achievement hunter, three runs is the most you'll need to get them all.  As for the puzzles, they're extremely basic. The only puzzles that can't be immediately solved happen to have a hint on a scrap of paper nearby. None of them require much thinking.  I found the story to be underwhelming. I expected much more because of the high quality of the art. At the end of my first game, I honestly cared very little for the main character. The dialog is fine, and there are some notes and journal/book pages that give you some background, but it never felt like there was enough.  As a game, I feel like it didn't deliver. It was short, easy, and had a basic story that seemed to only be there as an excuse to show off the artwork. As interactive artwork, it's quite creepy and grotesque and beautiful. Honestly, I think they could've just sold this as a digital artbook and charged quite a bit more.   As stated at the beginning of this review, if you're interested in the artwork, then it's definitely worth the price. If you're interested in a dark fantasy game with a rich world, good story, and solid puzzles, then I think you'll be disappointed.",

            "review_text": "A short and simple, yet very beautiful point and click adventure.  The main thing that attracted me to this title were its visuals, they're gorgeusly grotesque, like a less phalic H.R. Giger art style blended in with Dante's Divine Comedy. Combine that with the soundtrack that perfectly captures each screen you pass and you get a very atmospheric experience. I hope that at some point, they will release the soundtrack.  But yes, like mentioned, I believe the story is a take on the Divine Comedy, with the main protagonist taking a journey of redemption through his personal hell. Throughout this journey, you meet lots of characters who are corrupt in their own way and it's up to your own judgement to decide what choices to make when presented with a situation. Things aren't always what they seem.   My only gripes with the game are its short length and the puzzle difficulty, it's nothing new and everything can be completed fairly quickly. The only thing that holds it up are the choices you are presented within the game, which affect your journey and the final outcome of things. I also believe that for what it is, the game could have benefitted with a failure system of some kind, although not knowing whether it was a possibility definitely helped my experience.  But anyway, if you enjoy art styles similar to H.R. Giger or that of the Dark Souls franchise, I think you'll enjoy this title as much as I did, definitely worth a playthrough or two.",

            "review_text": "It's a straightforward point and click adventure game. I don't want you to get the wrong impression by me using the word 'straightforward,' though. In my opinion, most games in this genre have a horrible problem of including puzzles that are either too vague to figure out or having solutions that make no sense to anyone except the developers of the game. I've seen some people complaining that the game's puzzles are too easy, but to me, that just means the mechanics were clearly telegraphed, which is the sign of a good game. In my opinion, I shouldn't have to be running around, trying hundreds of different combinations in a desperate attempt to make progress in the game.  The story is pretty basic, but the world they created to host it is not. I almost wish they'd done more with some of these characters in regards to how they interact and where they end up after you're done with them.  The artwork is obviously gorgeous and lends to the experience a lot.   Sound is pretty good too. I can maybe see why they chose not to, but I think including voice acting for the dialogue would have gone a long way for this game. In general, I think they could have done a little more with the audio to really bring the world to life, but that's just my opinion.  The game is short, but it does encourage at least one replay, so there's that, and it may also seem shorter than other games in the genre just because it's so incredibly well streamlined and clear. If you encounter it on sale and are at all interested, you probably won't be disappointed. ",

As a experience, this was one of the best I'd had in years and all for such a low price. Its less than a tenner, only takes 4 hours to beat and is a hugely memorable experience.

Neutral: A very short game. It takes about two to three hours on a first playthrough. This can be good or bad depending on what you're looking for. The puzzles are all pretty simple. If you just want a light endrophine rush of puzzle solving, this might be good, but people looking for a challenge may be disappointed.  I enjoyed my time playing Tormentum and seeing its beautiful art.

I had heard it discussed and a few clicks through Steam and I was checking out the amazing artwork. Next thing I knew I was clicking 'Add to Cart' and haven't looked back.  EDIT: I wanted to make sure I noted that this game DOES have a demo! This is an excellent feature to have that is lacking in many games these days. If you want a true test of how this game is, skip the review and play the game yourself!  Let me get a few things straight:  This game is short. As an avid gamer but inexperienced in this genre, it took me about three hours to complete. Unlike other games of this type, I never found the puzzles to be too hard or too easy. Only once did I have to look up a hint which turned out to just be me not paying close enough attention. If you're looking for a serious mental struggle, you may not find it here. But, for someone who approaches this game more casually, I loved it.  Normally I try to look at how many hours I get out of a game compared to what I pay for it to find some balance. This game gets a bit of an exception just since I enjoyed myself so much. Normally I'd say a game this short would not be worth the price (and that may factor into your decision) but for me I am happy to support this developer and hope they make more in this vein.  There are moral choices in the game, which is hardly a new idea, but it's interesting to see how the game has subtle changes based on the decisions you make. The end result is more or less the same, but still, it's fun and gives it a level of replayability just to see the other options.  To me the story was interesting to follow and gives you just enough answers to understand what is going on but just enough mystery to make you wonder more about the world and what it may hold. I'd personally love to get to see more like it. Is it completely original? No, but it does what it does well.  The art alone is no reason to buy a game, but this game has some of the coolest I've seen in a while. It is detailed and interesting but not too cluttered, which is important for a point-and-click if you ask me. Gives me serious H. R. Giger vibes and as a huge Alien(s) fan, keep it coming.",

The game is dark and twisted and keeps you shrouded in suspense and mystery throughout the journey. I found myself playing this through the wee hours of the night. The artwork is fantastic and mind blowing and the characters are interesting and also morbid. I have never played a point and click that resembles anything close to this game. The way it is setup there are multiple reasons for replay. Awesome feast for the eyes and mind!",

I loved all the different characters in it, a rat prisoner, jester, villagers with animal skulls, the mage and all the other random characters you meet along the way.  The decision making is also great and will definitely make you think about how it is going to affect you in the end and the game either makes you like a character or dislike them and it will definitely change your mind about them! If you think you like a character in it or think you trust them, prepare to think the opposite half an hour later!  And don't get put off by the horror tag either if you're not a fan of horror because there are absolutely no jump scares at all, the atmosphere of the game is quite eerie and there is a lot of death, but it's a great game to make you think and send shivers down your spine. Be warned although it is not scary, the amazing artwork is quite gory at times but nonetheless stunning!  Also very twisty ending ;) It will make you want to play the game all over again, I played the game straight for a whole day and finished it in about 4 1/2 hours, probably would take you half that time second time round, and trust me you will want to play it again, change the choices you make and see what happens!  Overall this is one of the first point-and-click games I've played and boy did I love it! A must have for absolutely ANYONE, hardcore gamers, point-and-click fans, FPS fanboys, open world enthusiasts, RPG nerds ANY ♥♥♥♥ING ONE :D The creators of this game did a great job!  P.S. If you were a fan of the art as well they've also released an artbook for the game which I will definitely have to get!",

I actually bought the game not knowing what to expect, because all I looked at was the name and some of the screenshots. I waited about a month or so to actually start to play the game but I then finished it in one run, because I was bound to the story and the fascinating art (by that I mean the soundtrack, the philosophy and.. basically everything!). It took me about 2-3 hours and it REALLY was worth the while (maybe not worth 12€, but I'm fine with that).  If you'd ask me if I recommend it, it'd definitely say YES. For me personally, the 12€ is worth for 2-3 hours of a game (if you want to hunt those achievements and/or get all possible endings probably 7-9 hours), since I'm interested in art.  That's it from me.",

The dialogue is short and to the point. Leaves a lot to the imagination of what's going on.  Replay value is there, if you enjoyed it the first time you will enjoy it the second time by choosing different critical decisions that balance life/death for some non-playable characters.

The puzzles provide some obstacles but are not so difficult as to lead to frustration which might pull you out of the experience. It definitely encourages poking around at bits of the background to find things tucked away in buckets and barrels but everything makes sense and doesn't fall prey to'adventure game logic' much. The first play through took me about 3 hours which was just enough time to wrap up the journey and keep things from feeling like they were overstaying their welcome. There are choices to make, and it may be worth a 2nd playthrough if you want to see the other options you could have taken and their results. All in all, if you like adventure games, and you are at all drawn by the art style, it's very much worth taking the time to experience it. My one disappointment is that while there's a physical art book available on the developer site, there is no digital book ):",

            "review_text": "I am normally not one to like this style of game - point-and-clicks just aren't my thing. Yet, somehow, this game struck my interest. I had heard it discussed and a few clicks through Steam and I was checking out the amazing artwork. Next thing I knew I was clicking 'Add to Cart' and haven't looked back.  EDIT: I wanted to make sure I noted that this game DOES have a demo! This is an excellent feature to have that is lacking in many games these days. If you want a true test of how this game is, skip the review and play the game yourself!  Let me get a few things straight:  This game is short. As an avid gamer but inexperienced in this genre, it took me about three hours to complete. Unlike other games of this type, I never found the puzzles to be too hard or too easy. Only once did I have to look up a hint which turned out to just be me not paying close enough attention. If you're looking for a serious mental struggle, you may not find it here. But, for someone who approaches this game more casually, I loved it.  Normally I try to look at how many hours I get out of a game compared to what I pay for it to find some balance. This game gets a bit of an exception just since I enjoyed myself so much. Normally I'd say a game this short would not be worth the price (and that may factor into your decision) but for me I am happy to support this developer and hope they make more in this vein.  There are moral choices in the game, which is hardly a new idea, but it's interesting to see how the game has subtle changes based on the decisions you make. The end result is more or less the same, but still, it's fun and gives it a level of replayability just to see the other options.  To me the story was interesting to follow and gives you just enough answers to understand what is going on but just enough mystery to make you wonder more about the world and what it may hold. I'd personally love to get to see more like it. Is it completely original? No, but it does what it does well.  The art alone is no reason to buy a game, but this game has some of the coolest I've seen in a while. It is detailed and interesting but not too cluttered, which is important for a point-and-click if you ask me. Gives me serious H. R. Giger vibes and as a huge Alien(s) fan, keep it coming.",
