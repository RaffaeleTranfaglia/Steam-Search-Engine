            "review_text": "Before I begin let me tell you how much of an AVID gamer I am. I wake in the morning with my mouse and keyboard in hand. I dream about games and buy all the latest titles on the release day.  I remember waiting outside my local poundstretcher for the midnight release of Nintendogs:Chihuahua Edition and let me tell you, the excitement I felt on that cold November night doesn't even come close to the euphoria I experienced playing this masterpiece. I honestly think God is a better title than developer when it comes to Teddy Floppy Ear - Kayaking. 3 years ago when this piece of history was first announced, the TFE:K club was set up by myself and several members of the gaming elite from around the world. It's been hundreds, if not thousands of days since TFE:K's inception and we've still not ran out of great new things this game has going for it. STORY: I'd almost jump at the chance to give this a perfect 10/10, but there was a distinct lack of romance scenes and QTEs, so it's gotta be just a 9/10. This issue has thankfully been fixed in later titles in the TFE series. CHARACTERS: Another 9/10. What would have been a flawless cast and voice actor lineup is let down by the lack of Latvian voice actors for diversity. Once again this is fixed in later titles. GRAPHICS: 2 words- PER FECT! The masterful art stylings from in house animation teams have led to a game that is discernable from reality. It's only fair to give this section a 10/10. As a side note, the Teddy Dakimakura that comes bundled in a printable pdf is a wonderful addition. Just make sure your printer can handle the 4K, no, 8K Teddy textures this game puts out for maximum immersion. In short, GET THIS GAME. It has changed my life for the better, and made me an enlightened individual.    Help me I'm tired   ",

Ok let's start reviewing this game  Story 10/10 Yes, I'm giving this a 10. Why? Well it shouldn't even be a question in the first place. It's pretty obvious why I'm giving the story a 10. The game feels so real and the storytelling in this game is amazing. What happened to Teddy could happen to anyone in real life. I'm not going to spoil any more but let's just say that I shed a few tears.  Characters 10/10 Yes, also a 10. Teddy is probably the first character I've seen in a game that had this much character development. He feels unique and real. A Teddy might be walking around your own school.  Music 10/10 OOOoooh where do I even begin!!! Such nostalgic and epic music! I loved the OST's, especially during the fights.  This pretty much sums up my review. I hope you will all buy this amazing game. Can't recommend it enough. People in my class tell me it's a kids game, but they don't know what they are talking about.",

            "review_text": "  Mein Kampf is a great read too, though I don't mean that in a Nazi way. Reading it showed me how insane it was that, nowadays, people don't even know why Nazis disliked Jews. Mein Kampf is 95% against Communists, and Jews are hated mainly, if not only, because they're thought to be behind Communism. Nowadays, nobody highlights that fact, preferring to dehumanise Germans by assuming they were just 'racists', as if that explains anything and ends the conversation. Definitely worth a read. The New Ford translation is the best (I personally sent some proofreading to the publishers, for free, so now it's even better). Beware of translations that were intended to make Hitler sound like a nut. Poorly translating German, or any language, will do that, but Hitler wasn't ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and was, in fact, well-spoken and well-read. Just don't expect much about races and Jews. There's literally one or two mentions of Africans, and a chapter about Jews, but most of it is about nationalism, the fight against communism, and how to structure a fascist power structure.",

I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through.' I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.",

Mountain Adventure' I was happy to start another adventure game in the series, but the result is really disappointing. 'Mountain Adventure' was really nice balanced and it was a pleasure to see my daughter playing without any help. In contrast, in 'Kayaking' the story and quests are not so interesting and  minigames are extremely frustrating  due to specific physics of kayaking - your enemies and obstacles move fast and your kayak lags heavily; it blends into one of the most frustrating game experience I've ever had. Even the main gameplay (where Teddy is also mostly in kayak) suffers from poor response time, slow turning back and difficult maneuvering.",
