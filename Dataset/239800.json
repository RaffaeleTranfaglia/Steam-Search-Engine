My only complaint is it was just way too short. In 8 hours I beat the game through on every difficulty, unlocked everything, and even replayed some of it again after that for fun.

            "review_text": "In particular, the environments, enemies, bosses and the dash system stood out for me. I really liked the bosses and the enemies but the thing that let them down is the combat. I didn't feel like it was necessary to change weapons and to be honest I just used the Dual Pistols because everything else that I could afford (which wasn't very much, by the way, you get upgrades and more but in one playthrough you won't be able to afford very much - at least that was my personal experience) felt kind of out of place here and they were generally slow and therefore didn't really match up with the gameplay in Bleed, which is mostly fast paced gunplay, which is controlled by aiming with the mouse. Controller support however is available and works quite well, which was quite surprising. As for the slow-motion, I mostly forgot about it but it is somewhat necessary to defeat some bosses (especially the last boss) and is quite generous as it regenerates while you are in combat.   The health was another issue as it doesn't regernate in any way during gameplay and there is no way other than death to gain back health (not that I could see). With that said the checkpoints are very good and let you carry on from each different screen in the levels. Although this is good, when you close the game the checkpoints are not saved overall and you will have to start the level again from scratch - this isn't too much of a problem though because the game is quite short and shouldn't take you too long to get back to where you were previously  The music of Bleed is okay - I didn't think very much of it but it did serve its purpose well. Art is decent and in some points looks weird such as the animation on the main character (look at the legs!) but overall is well done and definitely isn't lazily done - which is great.  This game is very short and sweet, although the game does offer a lot of replay value after you beat the main game, such as unlocking new modes, weapons, characters as well as the many achievements and difficulty levels. This is great as it extends gameplay for a short game and will entertain you if you like replaying games. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes fast paced platformers and especially so if you like gunplay in them.",

            "review_text": "When I started using bullet time in addition to my guns, Bleed became much more enjoyable. The game moves too fast for you to run and gun like you can in other platformers of this sort. You have to employ bullet time in order to survive, even if you already possess lightning-fast reflexes. The gameplay was frustrating at first, especially with the combination of the right trigger to jump and the right stick to shoot, but after a little while the controls began to feel just right. Having the left trigger's bullet time compliment the right trigger's multi-jump was definitely a good move on the part of the developer.  In addition, there's reason to play the smallish number of levels over and over again when you earn points that can be spent on health and bullet time upgrades as well as new weapons. And the greater the difficulty setting, the greater the points you earn. So there's every reason to want to complete each stage on V. Hard. And the graphics and soundtrack are top notch, too.  So what are you waiting for? Go get yourself a copy... or borrow some playtime with Bleed from a friend's account. It's time and money worth spending.",

Personally, I feel that the best name for a game like this is 'Brief Awesomeness' due to short length and enjoyable gameplay. 'Bleed' is a really fun shoot-em-up with some pretty tight controls (Albeit an unusual control scheme from a gamepad perspective. Good luck with a keyboard.) and a good sense of humour. Unfortunately there are only seven levels so you can finish it in no time at all. The only way to make the experience last longer is to be a lousy player who keeps dying or trying to unlock all the achievements. Nevertheless, 'Bleed' is enjoyable for the amount of time you spend with it and it has got some replay value. It's currently 10% off and I think it's worth the current price. As for full price...

I haven't finished it 100%, there's still a number of unlocks, difficulties, and achieves for me to go for, but after finishing the game on normal, I have to say that it's some of the most fun I've had in quite a while.  So what it is? It's a classic-style action-platformer that plays like a mix of Megaman, Contra, and Gunstar Heroes. You have a number of weapons, ranging from the basic dual pistols and rocket launcher to explosive mines, a laser rifle, and a katana. Each one has it's uses situationally, but the game is plenty playable with whatever setup you prefer. I myself like the pistols for accuracy and the katana for its ability to deflect bullets. There's an incredibly controllable triple-jump, wall jumping, and bullet time to help you dodge the massive amount of ordnance that will be flying around. You'll progress through seven short levels, each with a miniboss and a boss. The levels are derivative, as this game is basically a love letter to its influences, but it does a number of neat things with the design. It operates on a checkpoint system, which is good, because while it's not that bad on normal, but it is approaching Nintendo hard, especially on the harder difficulties. Thanks to the liberal use of checkpoint, each inevitable death ceases to sting all that bad. Like Dark Souls, Bleed is very difficult, but never punishing. Every time you die, you will know why, and that's because you messed up. That's in addition to the absolute badassery you'll unleash. While for most games the triple-jump and bullet-time would be gimmicks, in Bleed they are central to both the combat and platforming and allow you to pull off some seriously awesome moves. Rather than being nastily cheap, Bleed gives you the tools to succeed and encourages you to rise to the challenge.  The story is practically nonexistant, as it was in the old days. It is the year 21XX, and the last century was the time of heroes. However, the heroes have gotten old, there's no new ones, and a cotton-candy-haired girl named Wryn dreams of supplanting them and becoming the greatest hero in the world. There is a twist, if you can call it that, at the end, but ultimately this has a classic-style video game plot to complement it's classic-style gameplay. All it is is a setup to excuse the chaos. If you want depth, look elsewhere.  One last comment. The game has a wonderful atmosphere. While most of the backgrounds resemble old SNES/Genesis backgrounds, the character designs are extremely cutesy, and pink is a prominent color in Wryn's character design. While I understand that this might be offputting for many gamers, the way the designer used it to contrast with the intense action is delightful, what little story there is is hilarious as a result, and the ending is pure saccharine joy. Give it a chance. Bleed may not be complex or terribly unique, but what it is is an absolute blast. Recommended to anyone who can deal with a bit of a challenge.",

The mash up of certain boss ups.. just didn't make any sense and in general.. just a weird game. Time flow control was cool.. but work on it harder next time.. put more effort in, sheesh. Some indie game devs I feel are getting lazy.",

If you are lucky, it's fun, if you're not, prepare for an unforgiving bullet hell where you can only take like 5 hits and have only a second of invulnerability and 2/3 of that invulnerability is doing a knockback animation. Unforgiving and luck based but had some moments of fun, mostly annoyance though.",

The 2nd and 6th levels are ridiculously hard while the rest seem to make more sense as far as progessively getting harder. I found the vast majority of the game to be irritating rather than fun. Luckily it is incredibly short, so you don't have to feel the pain for long, Replay value is minimal. There are 4 difficulty levels, but frankly normal is annoying enough. There are some options for different weapons but I used the starting gun for 99% of the games, the other 1% was just to see if the other weapons were worth using (they weren't). The enemies are boring and the level structure was probably the worst part, it was difficult in an annoying rather than challenging way. The boss battles were probably the best part of the games, they were moderately challenging but worth putting effort in to defeat. Ultimately, I just can't recommend this game.",

I beat this game entirely for the sake of completion, and like I said, it was fun for a bit, but got kinda boring.

Despite selling you several different weapons and upgrades, by the end you can purchase only a few, and the only useful weapon is picked up at the beginning of the game at no cost. The music is a retro chip tune which while perhaps having charm for some players, having only one track and playing nonstop meant I just muted the game from the halfway point. There's some catharsis to be found in the fun jumping and bullet time but it isn't enough to redeem the otherwise arbitrary and obtuse game design.",
