            "review_text": "READ THIS REVIEW BEFORE PURCHASING, PLEASE  I have purchased this game for the Nintendo Wii, the Xbox 360, and now the PC via Steam, and I feel confident in saying that the Xbox 360 version is hands-down the best version of the game, and that the version sold on Steam is hands-down the worst version for a number of reasons, which I will now give to you:  First of all, right after download, the game WON'T WORK FOR YOU. I cannot stress this emphatically enough: IT WILL NOT WORK. The game requires 'Games For Windows Marketplace,' a completely unrelated and obscure Microsoft download (not normally included in Windows) to be running, and then if the stars align the file MIGHT start up (after starting three times in a row for me, the fourth time it decided that it was done). This is pretty frustrating for what is essentially a kids' game.  IF (and that's a pretty big 'if') you get the game running, the second major issue is controller support. The Steam description touts 'Full controller support,' but this is not entirely accurate or true. I am using a wireless Xbox 360 controller with a USB dongle, which works flawlessly on all of the dozens of games in my library which were released after 2008 -- but not this one. The game has trouble recognizing that a controller is present, and seems to forget that one is connected quite frequently. Again, when the stars align and you do have the game running and the controller working, it does finally begin to resemble the Xbox 360 game in terms of playability, even if the game is not coded to display the Xbox 360 buttons, instead opting to show generic controller buttons (for example, the yellow 'Y' 360 button is mapped to a gray '1'). This in itself is not that big of a deal, but it isn't good for young children using the Microsoft product.  I honestly wish I could tell you more about the gameplay, but the chances are that you'll never see it which is a shame (although a little 'floaty,' the game is worth it for the 'Woody's Round-up' segment alone, which rewards exploration and quests with a lot of genuinely fun unlockable content). This version is a complete waste of money and time. If you already own an Xbox 360 and are looking for something to play with a child, or just want a good, solid light-hearted game, buy the Xbox 360 version, which has great visuals and two-player splitscreen co-op in a world filled with quests, upgrades and exploration. If you have no friends and hate yourself, check out the Wii version, which omits 2-player and replaces good old-fashioned button presses with wildly unpredictable waggling motion controls. As for the Steam version...  This Steam version is only for three types of people: 1.) Software developers who enjoy figuring out why a program doesn't work and Rube-Goldberging a solution 2.) Conscientious software pirates who want to own a legitimate copy of the game they torrented before the government finds them 3.) Richard Pryor in the movie 'Brewster's Millions' (I feel this last one is self-explanatory, but in case you haven't seen it, he has to spend one million dollars in a very limited time on in order to win a larger inheritance, the rub being at the ethat nd of the time alotted he has to have nothing to show for it, which descrbes this game perfectly).  Everyone else should just avoid it at all costs.",
