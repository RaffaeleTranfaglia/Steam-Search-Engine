            "review_text": " Devil May Cry  Killer is Dead is a 3rd person action game about a man named  Dante  Mondo who works for a killer-for-hire agency specializing in supernatural threats.  Dante  Mondo fights using a sword and a gun against a variety of enemies to try to stop  Vergil  David, who uses a sword as well but does not use a gun and has more fully embraced the dark power they both wield.  Jokes aside, Killer is Dead is very much 'what if Suda 51 did Devil May Cry'. The game absolutely oozes Suda 51 style, from the art style to the completely ridiculous and over the top characters and bosses. The combat is quite a bit simpler than DMC, revolving (mostly) around a single attack button and a block/dodge button, but is quite enjoyable and fast-paced nonetheless. The plot of the game isn't much to speak of, it only really picks up during the last few chapters. Overall, KiD, while having very obvious influences, is a very fun game with that marvelous Suda 51 style.",

Visuals :  As always, Suda51 games has a lot of style visually, this resembles a lot Killer7, which is, outlines made by strong shadows and it's overall a dapper look!   Story :   Suda games often has as much plot as you want it to have. Most of the times it feels like all the dialogue are written to be cool and meaningful in a mysterious way, but let's be real here, it isn't, it's style over substance, everything you'll get here will be your own personal interpretation, but really, it's just a story of ''what comes around goes around''.  Soundtrack and sound:  Pretty awesome, i mean, some tracks are forgetable, but other's are as cool as it can get! Voice actors do the job BUT they sometimes are too low and the music just eats it up, which is not cool, i tought we knew better after Sonic Adventure.  Hotness :   Mondo is pretty hot, the girl's are pretty hot too, there's hotness for everyone,  Performance :   Ok, this is where i don't know what the heck was going on, but it really stuttered on my pc, and i've played this on the pc before, and IT WASNT like this. It's weird, maybe it's because i'm using Windows 10 (Oh, whyyyy...shut up, everyone always does this, oooh, the new windows is garbage, blah blah blah, and then after two years you're all using it, bloody ♥♥♥♥♥♥.) so, well, it's playable, it just stutters at the beggining after starting a lever or restarting it, it's nothing game breaking. Also don't use th 60fps thing, yes it's nice, but it just breaks stuff, you'll be exiting and launching constantly to fix it, it sucks.  Overall :  It's a nice game, it's fun to play, it's kinda short, but hey, better be short than repetitive, plus, replay value is high, so i'll say this, if you enjoy any Suda game, you'll enjoy this one, otherwise, I dunno. Just wish they re-released killer7 for pc, just sayin'.",

            "review_text": "...so I was given 'Killer is Dead' as a gift.   if Suda 51 was a film studio, it would make bizarre art-house films, that have interesting visuals and a strange sense that the entire story is part of a larger world, but it would be broken up somewhat by cliche, flat characters who, while interestingly designed, have no real personalities.   And the girls would all be sexualized window dressings of various fetishistic flavours. While a small handful would be more interesting than just beat-off material, nobody (not even the men) really talk with any sort of natural language. It'd all be stilted and while poetic: odd and unnatural.   Killer is Dead doesn't really explain what it's about, even 4 missions into the game. The first level is truly odd, with an Alice-in-wonderland feel, but even more strange and uncomfortable.   The boss that shows up at the end has little context even in it's own weird, uncomfortable little world, and it's dialogue is really...I hate to use this word again but, bizarre. Again, it's stilted and poetic, but I feel that someone cut out some major scenes sot hat the main character can feel artificially badass with his growly, gravelly, Christian Bale voice while his female sidekick is aggravating to the point of making me want to stab her in the eye just so she'll shut. The. ♥♥♥♥. Up.   Ah yes, let's talk about that small slice of satan. The female assistant is Mika, and she is the physical embodiment of incapable. Her voice is squeaky and high pitched and she's supposed to be 'cute' but it's so forced and contrived that it stops being cute and simply becomes aggravating. A cardboard cut-out of a cliche, somehow making something that's already vapid appear even more 2 dimensional.   I'm somewhat interested in where the game is taking this train wreck but I'm not sure i'm going to be chugging along eagerly to see it.  Be aware, this is NOT my first Suda51 game. But it is the first that the...unique methods behind Suda51 have turned me off to it.",

            "review_text": "Killer is dead is the first time one of Suda51's action games got a spot in the PC market. The final result of this is an outstanding port (thank you unreal engine) from the 'how well it runs' section. Unfortunetly the options leave much to be desired giving you only low, medium, and high options for visuals.   STORY: The story is as predictibly unpredictable and crazy as every Suda51 game is. Essentially you play Mondo Zappa who is a badass. He does badass things with a badass katana and the government pays him millions just so he can upkeep that hair. There's also something about him being an assassin and killing things but really the game is all about that hair. If you have never played a Suda51 game expect to be confused at first, but things fall into place and it all (mostly?) makes sense by the end. Expect to learn and discover many things you missed if you ever give it a second go through.  GAMEPLAY: This is an action game not a world conquering simulator just as a warning for anyone who may be confused. The combat is very simple yet incredibly well done. From the start there is an attack button, a block/dodge button, a guard-break button, and a sub-weapon you may use. There are also alternate context-specific buttons and an upgrade tree that allows for progression as you play granting you new moves. Through the simple attack and blocks you will be pulling off incredibly satisfying combos of over 100 hits in just a matter of seconds. The better your combo the faster you attack. These mechanics all come together to create a deep engaging experience that leaves very little left to be wanted. I do suggest you play on hard your first go-round as (with most action games) the mechanics do not shine on lower difficulties. While not being a badass your main character is busy sexing it up with a woman. Of course by sexing it up I mean staring at a woman's chest and thighs while throwing presents he discovers they like (by putting 'gigalo' glasses on) and then throwing said presents at them until they throw their bodies on top of him (like I said that hair is irresistable.) 'Why is this under the gameplay section?' I'm sure you're asking. Well I'll tell you why! You have to control these actions and MUST do them if you want to acquire all weapons and if you want to get the cheevie for it then you will have to do it a number of times with the scenes getting more graphic with the amount of sexing they show of course! Did I mention Suda51 is a Japanese developer?   VISUALS: The graphics are wonderful. Also, no. That isn't your LCD moniter. The game does indeed look like that. You can stop rotating it up and down now.  SOUNDS: At the end of the sexing it up missions the main character screams really loudly 10/10  YOU SHOULD BUY THIS GAME IF: The PC doesn't have too many spectacle fighters/hack and slash games so if you want one of those then yes. Get it. If you like Anime then get this. If you like Action games then get this. If you like confusion (usually goes along with anime) get this. If you like to have fun get this. If you have ever played and enjoyed a Suda51 game before (e.g. No More Heroes 1/2, Killer7, Shadows of the Damned, and Lollypop Chainsaw) then get this game.  YOU SHOULD NOT BUY THIS GAME IF: You have played a Suda51 game and did not like it. His style remains imprinted everywhere here and it will not make you like something if you already don't. You enjoy not having fun. If staring through a woman's (read: empty vessels filled of nothing but giggling and sexdollism in this game) clothes is offensive to you. You don't like asian things.",

The original console versions were already pretty bad, but they fixed nothing with this PC launch. As if the more than frequent crashes weren't enough, If you force the game to run at 60 fps, 'Mondo Mission 3' will freeze everytime. The annoying multiples loading times to get to a mission are, for whatever reason, still here, so it doesn't matter than you have SSD's, the total loading screen time-waste remains too long.  The only 'good' thing I can say about the port is that it can run at 21:9 resolutions. Also, 'Flawless widescreen' fixes FOV problems, even if the game camera goes a bit wild with it.",

You fight a bug-lady who lives in an Escher painting, a samurai who can turn into a tiger, a vengeful locomotive, and a music producer.  These baddies are all infected with THE DARKNESS which is sort of a magic moon power thingy I don't really know. The game isn't exactly easy to follow, OK? But that's not important.

And then he hired a bunch of crazylikes supporters, they drew really crazy manga, spilled oiled-paint all over it and BAM: Killler is Dead was born.  While a decent enough slasher, the real charm of KiD comes from refrences upon refrences upon refrences from Space Odyssey and Devil May Cry to Sailor Moon and Alice in Wonderland.  Basically what you're going to do in this game is hack, slash and shoot everything that stands in your way. While usuall enemies are not a big problem, Boss fights sure pack a punch and style! It worth to play if only to check out those. The combat system is not that complex as in DMC but neither is simplified, it is fun to pull off lengthly combos combining sword, punches and sub-weapons (There are a few of those).  Plot is... ehm... well... It's there; Protagonist travels around world making a living as Executioner (Assassin), while game sure is short. Screw this, no spoilers just see for yourself.  Graphics. Bah it's all right. Art Style however outshines graphic in every regard. Really I can't say if graphics bad or good, but art style sure is something (good).   Now the game also does contain diffrent sub-missions (that are frankly just rip-offs of main story locations with a diffrent objective), that will help you to earn money and experience. Speaking of money, there are also so called Gigolo Missions: Main goal in those is to seduce a woman, by staring at her and showing presents in her face.  You know what, I thought of writing a complete and full rewiew with complex details, but to hell with it. I'll just give an honest opinion. Is KiD is a fun game? For me it is! It does contain a good balance between coocoo crazy humor and action packed adventure. Is it worth full price? Nah, but I bought it on discount price, and not regreting it.   So final thoughts. If you like slashers then Killer is Dead won't dissapoint you. But you should probably buy it when price dropes.",

If there's one thing about this game that I want to mention, it’s that I absolutely do NOT want this review to give away the content of this game. This game is rare gem.  KID is a very interesting game where you play as a guy named Mondo who works as an 'assassin' for a particular agency. There is a very set and precise storyline to the whole game, and you progress through it via various missions. The story isn't slow, nor is it very fast paced and the various 'quirks' in the missions make the game overall extremely hilarious and fun to get through.  Let me explain the basics:  The missions begin with an introduction of the agency's 'client' and who he/she wants eliminated. Oddly enough, each 'target' connects perfectly through the main storyline so there isn't much to stray from. The missions are recorded as 'Episodes' like a show, so it’s quite easy to follow. Normally the 'targets' are main bosses found at the end of each mission, and let me tell you this: DEM BOSSES THO. Each boss is entirely unique in its own way and trust me, you will continuously look forward to the next boss after finishing every mission.  Upon completion of each mission, you get rewards based on a grade (A-C, depending on how quickly and well you finish each mission) as well as side quests. These are actually quite fun as well. When you play through the story, you meet certain women in a few missions, and after completion, you get to do a side quest with these women. Basically, you're a playboy who’s trying to win over these women through the most... Jeebus, this game so clichéd that it’s an obvious joke. Win over their heart and mind, and please,    do not get slapped   , it’s a huge damper on Mondo's clichéd bad boy image.  The storyline in itself begins from the very first episode, and often you find the connection until after completing a mission or two. So if you're feeling dumbfounded in the beginning, it’s alright, the answers will come to you in time.  Before you complete the story, you'll find that you've unlocked    'Episode 51'   , I'd ask you to refrain from doing this mission until you've finished the game, or are on your final episode. The reason behind it is simple, this episode gives away a little too much if you complete it in advance, but that's just a suggestion.  The game also allows you to change the difficulty of the game at will. So you could start off on Hard, but switch to Easy without losing progress or having to start a new game all over.   One thing I found troublesome about this game was that the controls were weird. It’s not difficult at all (I've played this game on my laptop on a touchpad) but it takes a little bit of time to get used to. However, the camera control can become a little annoying sometimes, and that’s the only problem I found with the game.  Another thing I found odd, not particularly troublesome, was the women in this game. While your colleagues are... interesting (to say the least) the other women you come across in this game are just so bad. Let me be real, I saw their underwear. I saw the nicest underwear ever and I'm not sure I should be this pleased. Creators! Y U DO DIS? Personally, I DID NOT like or appreciate the way this game portrayed female characters, however this is probably because the game is heavily based on a lot of hilarious and untrue stereotypes.   Overall, KID is an extremely exciting and fun Hack 'N Slash game which I highly recommend. Even if it’s not a genre you'd normally be interested in, I still suggest picking up this gem because it’s literally very fun. You will not regret it. However, I do suggest picking up this game while it’s on sale because personally, I found this to be on the short end.  RATE: 8.5/10",

This game gives you your classiv hack n' slash feel. It's a lot more crisper and fluent than DMC or Ninja Gaiden In my own opinion. The story definitely lacks some answers in it. But the gameplay itself is enough to keep you playing game whether you know what's going on. Definitely a buy if you like these style games and this art. 10/10 (y).",

It challenges me the right way, it rewards me the right way.  some flaws of course but overall what an enjoyable experience. theres many games with this general scheme of action combat but this gets the pace just right. the timing of each attack/counter sets it apart from the countless other games with a similar setup. really one of the few games that made me retry a ton just to get it perfect because it matters. people may be turned off by the girls part but this is just a game made for a pretty specific demographic. its all icing on the cake for some great combat and its just over the top enough for each part that its perfect. highly enjoyable, check it out",

            "review_text": "I want to get my personal dissapointment with Killer is Dead out of the way: I wanted this game to be great - as it stands, however, it's just good. It has rock solid gameplay mechanics and stunning visuals, but its story and length make it feel underdeveloped.  As aformentioned, the actual slashing itself is pretty much flawless. The combat has weight to it, and every blow feels powerful and precise. For a character action game, there arn't many button combinations to remember: sword attacks are delegated to one button, and pertain to how long the button is held. Any combos that are present are optional and are used for very specific situations. Besides a sword, the protagonist has an arm cannon which can be used to shoot enemies from afar, and can be upgraded to perform other useful functions as well - the integration feels natural and adds another dimension to the combat.   The visuals are Suda51's trademark cel-shaded style, perfected with a more technical look. Color palettes are very simple throughout each level. Shadows are sharp, drowning the backdrop in a thick, dimly-tinted glaze; Light sources are harsh and distorting, burning through the mostly-dark environments. A thick layer of bloom compliments the conflicting light and dark, creating an almost dreamlike appearence. Easily some of the most striking visuals ever seen in a video game.  My main gripes with the game are it's story and overall length; however, I belive it is best to go blind for this kind of game, so I won't mention specific scenes. I'm not usually one to complain about game length, but Killer is Dead's story is much too ambitious for the paltry 7 hour length of the main campaign, although I'm not sure if more time would have helped it. Although I enjoy the 'as it happens' storytelling technique that this game utilizes, the story itself becomes convoluted past the point of enjoyable and is full of dead ends. Themes pop up and are quickly discarded, while plot twists are introduced without much buildup and consequentially lose their impact. A story can use vagueness to bolster itself, but when so little is explained of even the most important concepts there's very little incentive to look deeper... if there is even supposed to be depth.   I found myself wanting more out of the actual game as well. The touted 'Gigolo' dating minigame is fun and a nice break from combat... why are there only four different dates to play? More side missions wouldn't have hurt either, although there are already a steady amount of activities to get perfect grades on. It feels as though something is missing from KiD to give it an extra hook.  Don't be fooled by most 'professional' reviews out there; this game is definitely worth your time. I'd even reccomend it to those who are not accomodated to character action games because of the simple control scheme. What's there is fun and kooky; what isn't feels like a giant hole where it should be. There's a reason why it's only 20 dollars.  I'll see you on the dark side of the moon... ",

In addition to the glorious insanity of the main levels, you can play these really cool 'Gigolo Missions' in which your red-eyed swordsman gets to bed any of three sexy ladies if you can successfully ogle their naughty bits without being caught  and  bestow the gifts they desire.   The gameplay is mostly tried-but-true 3rd person slash 'em up, but it is a quite polished variation and there are a few unique twists -- altogether like high quality vanilla with exotic sprinkles. The story is gonzo, but it hangs together well enough for my taste. The finale is way open-ended, and according to one interview with Suda51, there might be a sequel (the game did a lot better in its native Japan than here, so hopefully that counts for something).   My only gripe is with the porting. The Steam version is locked at 30 FPS, but can be jacked up to 120 with a little .ini finagling. Also, some people have experienced some crashes, and a few can't get it to run at all. Now I didn't have any crashes, but I found having to manually adjust the framerate to be somewhat annoying . . . I mean, I should just be playing the damn game, not fussing around with config files! I would say it is worth the trouble though.",

            "review_text": "'Killer is Dead' is a mediocre action game. It tries so hard to be good that it just ends up embarassing itself. Reminds me of Jayden Smith.  STORY: Honestly, just skip the cutscenes. The story is boring, makes no sense and tries too hard to be cool and edgy. You play as Mondo, an assassin or whatever with a robot arm because... its cool I guess? I stopped caring after the 5th mission.  It tries so hard to be philosophical and it ends up being a chore to watch. It also randomly breaks the 4th wall and adds a few funny moments here and there, yet, the mood is ALWAYS dark, asking you to take it seriously. Are we supposed to? Mondo has no personality at all, neither do the other characters. The game is short, too with only 12 missions. Also, FIVE 4 - 6 minute cutscenes of boring and uninteresting story before one specific mission.  Story - Just. stop. You're embarrasing yourself. Why/10.  GAMEPLAY:  Now, not everything is garbage. The combat is actually pretty fun, it has some great mechanics, some which are a joy to watch in action. Very similar to other SUDA 51 games such as No More Heroes and Lollipop Chainsaw. You can roll, block and parry (if you buy that skill). Upgrading Mondo is fun too since everything is done by fighting. Everytime you kill an enemy, it drops BLOOD points, Health points and currency. By killing enemies with a combo, you get to choose the item that you want. Want to level up your health bar? Go ahead. Need more currency? No problem.  Remember how I said you can roll? If you dodge just before you get hit by an enemy, you go into this slow mo effect which allows you to mash X as fast as you can to rack up damage. The whole screen turns red, black and white. Its such a joy to watch.  The camera is a huge pain is the ♥♥♥, though. It constantly focuses on the one enemy you're attacking, this works for boss fights but not when there's 6 or 7 guys on the screen at once, all trying to kill you. The lock-on system is busted, too. It will constantly get in the way when you try to switch targets quickly, like when an enemy comes from behind when you are busy with another. It either won't let you, or it will attack a completely random one.   Besides the combat, there's also what they call 'Giggolo Missions'. In this missions you have to build courage by looking at your 'Beauty's' breasts, legs, butt... and then when you fill the bar, you give them a gift until they love you. Not even watching porn makes me feel this dirty. Luckily, these are entirely optional.   Gameplay - Fun and fast paced.   ARTSTYLE: This is more of a personal gripe with the game. Feel free to skip this part. The artstyle is unique in its own way but it gets old, fast. Everything is dark which only makes everything feels boring and lifeless. Everyone looks glossy. It has its moments like in the mission where you're on a train or in the samurai gardens but the rest of the time, everything looks dull and uninteresting.   Artstyle: Edgy cellshading/10.  VERDICT:   KID is a mediocre game only saved by its combat but not much else. If you want to play this game I'd recommend waiting for a sale. 80% off. Were it not for how good it feels to get a 100 hit combo, I would not recommend this game. At all. Though, I'm dissapointed, Suda. I expected more from you.",

Bosses are REALLY (aesthetically) bad designed and maybe also on a moveset level. Bonuses, like Beauties or the Syringe Lady or even parts of the plot are inappropriate on a very high level and make you feel like a final-stage japanese shut-in otaku.  All this aside, the realization of the port is quite bad too. The game is capped at 30 fps and since everything, is checked upon frames, increasing the framerate results in harder/easier moves/QTEs/etc. The auto-save feature (which I generally love) is kinda bad designed for boss fights: once you kill the boss the game DOESN'T SAVE, instead it saves after 2 cutscenes; the game crashed on me 3 times during those cutscenes and I had to kill those bosses again...

Best thing about this game: It is pretty fun to jump in from time to time to feel like a badass, but sadly that is all. That gets old pretty quick and there isn't really any logical progression to the story that I could find and they never really explain things so at the end of the day it is fun for a while but ultimately 'just okay'  Also worth noting is that this is very much a console game, it has a 30fps lock that can only be bypassed by editing config files and rather than have rebindable keys it has two different control layouts (the default one is good enough though in my opinion). The camera movement also feels very 'slide-y' where I wasn't sure if my sensitivity was too high or too low because it basically has something similar to mouse smoothing which I can only assume is coming from the expectation of using a controller where it would move faster when you move the camera for a longer time.  If you can get it cheap then go ahead, you will more than likely get at least a few hours of fun out of it and maybe even come back from time to time for some 'dumb fun' but I doubt anyone is willing to sit through mission after mission pretty much doing the same thing with no clue why just to see the conclusion if there even is a clear ending that makes sense (this is coming from someone who got 5 hours in before the repetition got to me so take this with a slight grain of salt)  This game makes me wish we could get a 'recommended if 90% off' option when reviewing.

No, but the mechanics is still solid and fun enough without sacrificing the game story. So overall, it's a good game with a quirky story and fun gameplay all for a good price.

From the brain of Suda51 known for Killer 7, Lollipop Chainsaw, No More Heroes. If you like wierd stuff than you will like any of his games.   A fun hack and slash game with funny characters and dialogue.",

For one, it's combat is a lot of fun, and it works well both on the keyboard and the controller. There is a decent variety of enemies in the game, adding to the challenge overall. The difficulty also varies a lot from battle to battle. Like any Suda51 game, there is bound to be an odd story, and Killer Is Dead is no exception. The story is a little confusing, but it's very satisfying once the main story concludes. There are also fun side missions as well that help improve your character. I absolutely recommend Killer Is Dead for anyone who wants to an original action game. It isn't too long, yet it's one you can spend a decent amount of time with.",

Fun game, Killer is Dead has a good story; however not an amazing one. The one thing I do not like is the camera movements they are very akward and can sometimes be frustrating. If you love anime you will most likely like this game.",
