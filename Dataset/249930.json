            "review_text": "It's a rather old game based on a very old game, that's Japanese. Now, being Japanese is important, because they have not been following the western developments of user interfaces. Specifically, nothing is intuitive and works as you'd expect. You can't just click on a train to get information, not even in the train list information window. No, in order to get information about anything, you must know exactly which window to open. The graphics in this game are just that, graphics. They have nothing to do with gameplay. A small city can bring much more passengers than a large one and there is no hint as to why. It's also all very dated being grid based even though it is in 3D, but A-Train 9 apparently at least improves on that aspect.",

I'm sure it's not that bad of a game (despite the default controls being a littel wonky), but without a tutorial level i'm not going to give it much time.  -Sorry",
