    "description": "Once upon a time, a little boy from our world found himself in another, more mystical world where a magical crown made him ruler over a floundering kingdom called Alpoko. You are this little boy, and it's your duty to make Alpoko great...so you can then expand its dominion and take over the world!",

            "review_text": "  Little King's Story   was a great game for the Wii, and probably one of the best.  The game is practically a mix of   Pikmin, Animal Crossing,   and some other RPG-like elements. If you enjoyed anything  Pikmin  related, you will most likely enjoy  Little King's Story   --However! In this Steam port, there are quite a hefty number of issues, ranging from low FPS, to frequent random game crashes. In the meantime I will (sadly) have to give this game a thumbs down until a statisfactory patch/update is instilled.   If you're desperate to play this game, you're probably better off buying it for the Wii.  ",

            "review_text": "First off, most issues seem to be known by the people making this port, and it's in work. Since it can be made to work as well as the Wii version, I have to recommend it since I recommend the Wii version.  The music in the game is light hearted and inspiring. This was in fact what made me fall in love with it in the first place. When the lone ranger theme started playing for the first miniboss, I couldn't help but laugh.  The character design fits the music. Every character has character. You can even tell the townsfolk apart, even in the same job at times. I'm certain you will get to the point where you can start putting names to faces like I did!  The writing feels like it was made to entertain children, but there are enough jokes in there for mature audiences to keep everyone involved.  The controls are where I feel it's lacking the most. Even the controller controls have their flaws. I heard the keyboard controls are worse, but I can't speak for them. The controller plays on the joystick for best results, but the aiming seems to lock onto only one of 8 directions. You cannot fine tune your aim. This is a problem that follows from the original game. However when targetting enemies, it's better, but it's difficult to actually select different targets. You usually just get the closest to you.  **Edit: After a little bit of research the controls are actually true to the original I've found. The original on the Wii did not use the wiimote as a pointer device, nor did it allow you to move in more than 8 directions. I have contacted XSeed about this, and they have said that mouse controls would have required a complete rework of the game, and won't be in. Still if you enjoyed the original, you should enjoy this just as much. Likely anyone saying otherwise about the controls does not remember the original the way it really was.**  The sound also has a known issue if you have Windows set to anything other than Stereo. It will pop badly. This isn't your headset or speakers dying, it's just a problem. Before you play go into Windows Control Panel &gt; Sound and set your primary sound source to Stereo. Hopefully this is fixed in a patch soon.  There is also an option for bloom in the starup config. If you don't like the bloom, which can make things a little blurry at times, turn it off. It's the option called 'Post Effect.' I personally like it, as I remember it being in the original, and gives you a kind of watery eyes tired look near the end of the day. You are a kid after all, it is past your bedtime.  Finally, there's a big stink about the 60FPS option being very buggy. I have not had a chance to try it, but there is a clear warning not to use it in the config menu. Right now use it at your own risk. Many animations in the game, as well as the gameplay, are currently tied to the framerate. This might be fixed in the future, but what it means now is things will get out of sync in cutscenes, and the game will run fast, and choppy at times. This is not the fault of XSeed, as it was a design choice from the original developer. I don't know if it can be fixed.  In short, this game runs on PC nearly as well as the original Wii. The graphics have been upgraded, and it can be run on higher resolution. Just don't use the 60 fps, make sure Windows is set to stereo sound, and set the config in the beginning the way that's best for you and you'll enjoy it as much as I do. If you need one of these other options like 60 fps, then I recommend waiting a while before buying it, as it may be coming.",

            "review_text": "I played, and adored, the original version of Little King's Story on the wii. This was one of my FAVORITE wii games, so I was estatic about the idea of a hd version of the game. But I will be honest with you, there are bugs. I have crashed a few times, maybe four, five times. Theres also a strobe like effect with an enemy attack that's a bit annoying, but not game breaking as far as I can tell. And yes, it doesn't run at 60 fps without major issues. Theres also no mouse support, which, I find the idea of playing this sort of game with a mouse odd, but I understand there are those of you who don't like controllers. Something to keep in mind however.. The wii version was designed to run at 30 fps, enemy attacks were timed and based off that frame rate. So to me, trying to play the game at sixty frames is just ASKING for glitches, and honestly seems pointless as the game is only supposed to be HD, not a remaster. Xseed is aware of these glitches and are (supposedly) working with the team that ported the game for them to fix the glitches that cause crashing. And despite those negatives listed up there, I absolutely feel this game was a good buy. Its much crisper looking than it used to be on the wii. Some of the details I can see now, compaired to the wii version, makes me realize just how different characters looked to what I THOUGHT they looked like. I can actually see villagers faces now! It still has its original soundtrack, which I always found cute. The gameplay itself is still great, and figuring out how to play it with an x-box one controller was an easy task. I didn't really have to adjust my playstyle in the transiton from wii controlls to the controller controls, which pleased me. I've always thought little kings story was an adorable tale, merging childhood imagination with world domination in a normally amusing fashion, and the story hasn't changed one bit in this version, retaining all of its charm. Building up Alpoko is still so very rewarding feeling, as you watch your tiny kingdom grow and fill up with more buildings and people. If you're prepaired for the glitches and willing to put aside the mindset of everything has to be 60 fps, I think this is a good purchase for both old fans and potentally new ones.",
