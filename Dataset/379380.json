    "description": "If you like your games violent, youâ€™re in for a sick treat with Re-Loaded, the sequel to the popular blood-fest shooter Loaded. Re-Loaded is set over a number of 3D levels each more harrowing than the last. The sound effects will have you cringing, and the character animations show each minuscule trait of the six maniacs.",
