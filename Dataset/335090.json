            "review_text": "Goscurry is one hell of a difficult game, a game so difficult you even have to accept a warning at the beginning agreeing to submit yourself to the oncoming challenge.  As hopeless as that may seem the game constantly conveys to you one simple uplifting message; 'Don't Panic'. This is much easier said than done as panic is your worst enemy in Goscurry, the first sign of hesitation being your instant downfall. Flashing texts across the rooftops of a slick retrofuture city of minimalistic neon buildings bearing distracting, sometimes encouraging messages and what seem to be references to The Beatles ('You Are 'Not' the Walrus') and Pink Floyd ('Crazy Diamond').  Here you'll find the hypnotizing and maze-like pathway following mechanics of a game like Super Hexagon combined with the obstacle dodging action of titles from the likes of Bit.Trip Runner that all require a serious amount of focus and finger gymnastics. A long stretch of winding and unpredictably twisting road that procedurally builds itself before you, infinitely until your inevitable death. Many hazards litter the abstract urban road ahead forcing you to jump, dash, and dodge your way to a badass highscore you can really be proud of.  Reaching certain target scores in any respective mode unlocks new cities of different flourishing colors to discover and rush through, as well as giving you a higher rank in your overall achievement score. Ranking up earns you slick new rides to drive and fly with. The more insane of players may even earn all 20 ranks giving them the legendary and sought-after Psycho ship, which when used will speed up the game and raise your score no matter what the mode.  As incredibly addictive as Goscurry is, I feel like what really drives your adrenaline here is the catchy as can be electro-beat soundtrack from master musician Isak Martinsson(who is currently working on the wonderfully creepy adventure game,  Fran Bow  [www.franbow.com] ), equally as hypnotizing and entrancing as watching the flow of your stylish little rocket ship through each mind-bending stage of twists and turns. An excellent audiovisual combination assaults your senses and is the driving force in your speed and focus as you reach further and further for that final stretch of road.  tl;dr:  Goscurry is a game that gets right to the point, avoiding all of the pre-fun ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, all of the fluff and filler of other games and diving right into the fun and mayhem. Just zone out, follow the twisting path of the line ahead, and lose yourself to the beat of the music as it electronically charges your mind and body putting you into that nostalgic state of euphoria needed to find the flow.   Relax. Don't Panic. Be Brave! ",

            "review_text": "Goscurry is a fun 'hard game' where you race around a randomly generated track. Unlike some 'hard games', I don't find the constant failure here annoying. This is because the game is simple enough to get a hang of, and yet it has a good level of difficulty that you can get better at handling with practice.  The controls in this game are very customizeable. I found some difficulty in getting it to register all of the buttons on my xbox controller, but I find that overall the keyboard combined ith the mouse is easiest to control.  The graphics in this game, as well as the music and sounds give the game a very arcade / retro electronic feel. This, coupled with the fact that it is detailed and not overly minimalistic [to the point of being 'blank and flat' like some games] in its retro nature make the game very enjoyable and relaxing.  This game has leaderboards, which provides a fun extra challenge. This along with the various achievements and levelling give the game lots of tasks to complete, so you need not worry about running out of challenges.  A well polished 'hard game', which takes the common elements of platformer games and retro graphics, and throws in a racing element is definitely worth getting.",

The general repetitiveness (reiteration) of the levels invites skill-based improvements. Sometimes I can pull things off, when my fingers are willing, which seem like magic.",
