            "review_text": "This is a game that could have been a lot better if it were a little tighter - the 'after' portion of the game is amazing and some of the best writing/suspense I've seen in a VN outside of 999/virtues last reward, but at a certain point in the later parts of the game it begins to overstay its welcome and wallow in its own story.  Once the core mysteries are solved the game meanders for a significant time exploring characters in a way that feels superficial and forced when it could have just gone for the ending and provided a satisfying experience.  The other issue is the sense system, which is functionally a regular choice system where the choices are obfuscated. I really wish the game had just given the option to select the choices from the get go. The sense system does tie into the story but they sacrifice wayyyy to much in playablity for what it adds on that front.  The Xtend content (which full disclosure I've not finished) doesn't feel like it adds much to the story and is eminently skippable.  The game is worth a purchase, and is good overall (especially the first quarter where the setup, suspense and writing quality was better than almost any other VN I'd read) but only grab it if you are willing to accept a deeply flawed VN whose heart is in the right place.  For fans of Never, Ever and Remember this is MOSTLY better than those entries, the exception being that I think those games handle their twists and pacing better. I feel sad because if Takumi Nakazawa and Kotaro Uchikoshi had worked on this together instead of it just being Nakazawa I can't help but feel that with the setup it had this would have been a VN of almost unrivaled quality.  EDIT: Just want to clarify and say that this game has so many negatives in my review because it fails to live up to its own potential, its still better than 70% of Visual Novels I've read.",

            "review_text": "The director of the bankrupted KID's Infinity Series Takumi Nakazawa has yet to disappoint me: this new game of his has been a real masterpiece. Even though it is not as shocking as its predecessors (it is unarguably an 'infinity' game alongside the others for its themes, pace, extensive and thorough sci-fi elements, and epilogue) perhaps because we got accustomed in such endings of his (though BC ending was indeed mind-blowing and could hardly be foreseen), it's been a jewel in story-telling, character development and plot planning. I shall explain my self better: every turn of events in both timelines arises from the story itself and there is not even a tiny hole in all the although complicated plot; characters are so well characterised and emotional parts felt really moving because of that, especially the slice-of-life part of BC route served none other purpose than that of creating such empathy between the reader and characters and it worked really well, and thinking how everything ended it’s even more satisfying. In the end, all pieces of the puzzle that were scattered along the story wisely and with care fit slowly but steadily together and everything (and I mean everything, even the titles of sub-chapters) has a purpose either narratively or philosophically (the true ending was the most intriguing and philosophically fascinating I've ever read in my own life).   A special mention goes to the Sympathy System that replacing canonical choices system with bars with which the reader can adjust his own attitude and feelings towards the characters although it may seem dull later on (on most the time on BC route and later on) it fit so well in the story in such many ways I think it is such a brilliant gameplay choice I cannot label whomever thought of it other than a genius.  Another praiseworthy field was the art. Lots of well drawn CGs, with perfect timing in order to heighten involvement.  I also liked a lot the “anticipation” trailer on every true ending of a route; it was a real hype-generating device that drew me to instantly begin the other routes despite a long session of reading (because of enthralling endings). The only thing it did not stand out but did its own work well apart from writing itself because, well, it’s a visual novel not a book, was the soundtrack. Well composed but too few tracks for a 70 hours+ long vn.  A must buy for every VN fan out there, and a HURRY UP! BUY IT NOW FOR CHRIST’S SAKE for a sci-fi ♥♥♥ like me.",

            "review_text": "*Edited* Now that I've actually finished Root Double...  Buy this VN. Seriously. Root Double has such an interesting story. The character building is pretty good, the music seems to always fit appropriately to the setting and are a joy to listen to, there are twists that may make you go 'oh ♥♥♥♥!'.   Root Double is so good that when I went back to do a different route, I kept on reading as usual instead of skipping even if the scene was the same as last time because, dammit, it was that much of a joy to read.  Route A is so full of tense moments and suspense, its undoubtably the best part of the VN. But the rest is good too!  If I had to say anything 'bad' about this game, it's that I wish they did more with the SSS system outside of Route A. Also, the Xtend Episode kind of felt a little sloppy in a way, could have definitely been done better. Some parts of the VN felt unnecessarily replayed in the story, you can't help but wonder why they bothered to bring up something that was already done, but whatever.   All in all, I give Root Double the highest 9/10 I can possibly give.",

Like a lot of other VNs going for 100% completion with bad ends is kind of a chore (though some bad ends are really interesting, you'll most likely know what's going to happen when you hit it)  SSS mechanic is kinda 'meh' to me since it could range from 1-3 (instead of 0-8) and make no difference from what I understand.  Like a lot of other good VNs we go on a rollercoaster of emotions from route to route, as questions get answered . I've felt: despair, confusion, fear, sadness, and joy so it's definitely a good ride.  lastly, no more fictional physics lectures ! ! !",

This is my last buy from Sekai, I will eventually read this on my laptop because I know the main writer and he is great, but sucks that I have to play in my laptop because they  1. lie in requisites or 2. they can't fix the errors. (probably 2, because the requisites doesn't have to do anything with sekai)",
