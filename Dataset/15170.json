Its deff worth the money for the amount of hours you WILL sink into it lol.",

It started with HoMM3, that I was introduced to by my friends in 5th or 6th grade, and I ordered it soon after that. After playing HoMM3 for so many hours, I thought HoMM4 would be as good, but was deeply dissapointed when almost EVERYTHING was changed, from the town-system to hero-mechanics. Therefore, my hopes for HoMM5 were somewhat lower than what should have been appropriate, because HoMM5 brought back what HoMM3 was, in 3D graphics! I have loved almost every hour spent on this title (it far exceeds the '105 hours' listed on steam, I had the game on CD years before even joining steam), and this one is a strong 'Must buy'-title! If you like tactical turn-based strategy set in a rich fantasy world with many different factions to choose from, this is the game for you! (If you want to go a bit more retro I would also recommende HoMM3, of course ;) )",

It used to be fine, but now that my hero learned Deflect Missile (and taught it to all my other heroes), that's all they cast in battle. I will be battling against casters or just foot soldiers, and if left to his/her own, my heroes will just start uselessly defending against missiles!  UI is super buggy. Clicking is a little off on buttons but the worst is using sliders. For instance, using the marketplace to exchange resources REQUIRES using the slider. Most of the time the slider doesn't work. Sometimes as you grab and wiggle around it will jump the bar somewhere around where you wanted it. It is impossible to get it exactly where you want it, so after 20-30 seconds of trying to slide, you will choose a value that is 'close enough'. Same thing when you split your armies, the slider is terrible so it's easier to split army in half (default position of slider), do transfer, then continue splitting the result in half until you get the exact amount you wanted.  This is definitely a keyboard-only game. Most of the screentips show you which buttons to press, but there are still many that you can only figure out by trial/error. For instance, there is no way to split armies without using the keyboard, and there's no tooltip letting you know to hold shift and drag the army.",

The artwork in Heroes III was perfect. But now we must have rotating cameras in the city for added dizziness and disorientation to the player, and also this messy world map that can be rotated. SIMPLE IS BETTER, PEOPLE! I will not buy another HOMM title until they go back to simplicity. A simple, elegant art style with a balanced gameplay like Heroes III.  Don't get me wrong, HOMM 5 is not the worst in the series. Gameplay-wise, it sort of improved on the broken predecessor. But they went all fancy with the town themes and art style. So the game PLAYS well in terms of balance and strategy, but feels silly and you can't take it serious because the 3D models have this stupid exaggerated style and the town themes are dumb. It's not a world you feel like you want to daydream into when you play like it was with Heroes III.  Obsidian went back to roots with 'Pillars of Eternity' by returning to a SIMPLE, ELEGANT and FUNCTIONAL graphics style, and the game was a success. The same needs to be done with the Heroes series. A new sequel is releasing now, what, is it 7 or 8? I stopped keeping track after 6 because it's ruined now.",
