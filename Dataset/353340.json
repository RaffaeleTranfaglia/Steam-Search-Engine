            "review_text": "I can't recommend Dungeon Highway, not for an asking price of seven dollars.  However what you'll get for your hard earned monies (should you buy this) is: The same sprite pack that the free game Realm of the Mad god uses. The highway. Cubes on the highway.  You run slowly down the highway in two frame of animaton and avoid the cubes. There are enemies too but unless you're aiming for a high score you can just ignore them. The scoreboard doesn't seem to work so don't bother with scoring.  In the - short - time I played I suspect I've seen all that Dungeon Highway has to offer. Which does include a lot of pixelated blood and a giant floaty big bad pixel thing. You'll only see the blood when you die, and you'll generally only die because a cube you've already passed has entirely obscured the rest of the higway in front of it making it impossible to tell where the next cube is.  All in all this feel like it was written in an afternoon and would be better had it been released for free.",
