While easy to figure out after muddling around in the hangar for a while the game lacks anything resembling a decent tutorial and the cursor/controls are not very responsive/seem to be partially broken.  Doesn't really have much in the way of BGM and the pew pew just gets old fast.  I picked this game up in a bundle for $4, I definitely would not recommend buying this game for it's store price.",
