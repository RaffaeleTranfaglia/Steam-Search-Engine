Enrich your planet with plants, minerals and animal life. There is only one thing on the planet that you do not control: mankind, with all their virtues and and all their vices.",

            "review_text": "Goats and amethysts.  No.  Blueberries and frogs.  No?  What do you little bobbleheads want from me?  Reus is a resource management god-sim that has you taking on the role of the planet itself, controlling four powerful giants that carry out your will and alter the landscape to your whim. You can create trees and animal life, grow entire plots of fertile swampland, and one of your giants can even punch veins of precious stones directly into the crust.   All of this, to attract the ungrateful little bobbleheads known as man to build great cities upon your surface. The humans create many great works on their own- well, with your help. Your giants can directly influence whether or not they complete their projects (do you really want a mad scientist around? How about a sacrificial altar?) by altering the landscape further, creating new resources that meet the goals of these projects. The more you complete, the more varying projects and resources you unlock, and thus the rabbit hole goes deeper. You can even unlock longer game-times as well, allowing more time to create and build, and allowing more time for the humans to try and rise up against you and your giants.  They do go to war with each other. And they'll attack your god titans too, which is a curious choice. Your giants can slaughter them back, as any good vengeful potential goddess will be happy to know.  The game can get quite complicated as you go on, however, the title screen provides a link to the Reus wiki, which will give a lot of ideas and help.  The graphics themselves are cartoony and relatively simple looking, but always bright and interesting to look at. The game is on a 2D scale, all around the surface of the planet. Your giants traverse the outside of the planet as well, so some of your time will be spent waiting for the big lugs to get to where they're going, but since their abilities have cool-down meters, that isn't too much of a problem. The soundtrack is rather limited, though, so have some of your own music handy for the longer games.  Overall, Reus is a well-designed god game. It'll start off just slow enough to get you hooked, and keep you in for the long haul as you look to see what you can accomplish next.",

Tough, but doable. 5 - Villages start to attack each other. Hey, stop that! 6 - A massive avalanche of goals and deadlines start to overcome you and 7 - OH GOD WHY THE HELL DO YOU GUYS KEEP ATTACKING THOSE HALF-WITTED FISHERMEN WHO THE HECK TAUGHT YOU THIS BULLSH*T AND WHY IS THAT GUY NOT RESPONDING TO 8 - You start off with a clean world...",

If you're not a completionist, you'll probably get bored after the first few games.  You control four elemental gods: rock, forest, ocean, and swamp. They can create three inhabitable biomes upon the planet: swamp, forest, or desert. Additionally, they can each create and improve different versions of the three resources: food, gold, and tech. As you create resources, villages settle around them. As the villages improve, they will pick specialties and demand more of some of the resources. If you give them too much too fast, they will become greedy and attack each other. If you don't satisfy their needs in time, their specialty will disappear. If you do satisfy their needs, they will gift you with an ambassador. Ambassadors are used to increase the power of your gods. Each god will get different powers from the ambassador depending on the village's biome.  On its face, the game is quite simple. When you aim for some of the more advanced achievements, you are forced to strategize a lot more. On which biomes should I allow villages to settle so I can get the best ambassadors? Which giant should pick up that ambassador? How do I grow this village without it becoming too greedy? If you enjoy micromanaging, this game might be right up your alley.",

Well worth the price for the number of hours it will take to get all achievements.

            "review_text": "Reus is fun for the first 2-3 hours. By then you've seen everything the game has to offer and realize it isn't worth continuing just to nab all those elusive steam achievements. The game seems pretty well-made but it is ultimately just a casual god-sim severely lacking in excitement.  You control four giants that can terraform a barren planet, adding oceans, forests, mountains, and swamps, as well as plants, animals, and minerals to each. Your job is to make the planet habitable and provide human settlers with whatever resource they need from food, tech, and wealth. You have 30 minutes to make the humans as prosperous and happy as possible. Or you could kill them if you think they're becoming too greedy. The choice is yours and yours alone!  Helping the humans complete projects (i.e. acquire a certain amount of food, tech, and wealth in a limited time span) provides an Ambassador for one of your giants. Picking up the ambassador provides minor power-ups to the abilities you already possess. The game has 13 different tech trees for you to attempt to understand. Each possible tech tree is tied to a biome (ocean, forest, mountain, swamp) and resource (animal, plant, mineral). You cannot unlock all abilities in a single play session, so you'll need to pick and choose how to use your ambassadors to best affect. I really like this concept, but in practice it is poorly implemented. The in-game prompts for how Ambassadors affect each giant and how each upgraded ability affects the different resources is incredibly confusing to understand.  The game attempts to offer replayability by providing a number of conflicting objectives (steam achievements), forcing you to play a ridiculous number of times in order to complete all the objectives. (Yes, the steam achievements are the only objectives this game provides.) Unfortunately, nothing ever changes between plays so the game grows boring very quickly. The 30-minute sessions just seem to drag on forever, and just when you're wondering if it will ever end, the game then allows you to increase the time limit to 60 minutes. That's 60 minutes of boredom, catering to the every whim and need of the pesky humans.",

Some people like the ability to actually influence specific citizens or creatures, I prefer the Reus approach where the little factors all are automatic and you just make big decisions. Some people also prefer an open-ended game, while I prefer the goal oriented design of Reus. You can play for as long as you want even after the era ends so I'm not sure why some people complain about it.  I am rather confused on why many reviews call it a puzzle game. Yes, you have certain objectives meaning you need to structure your cities in a certain way, but it doesn't pigeon-hole you into a puzzle by any stretch. For instance lets say you need 100 food to make a farm - you could plant some bushes, or you could make your grassland an ocean and make fish, or you could put chickens by your bushes, etc. Or you can choose to destroy the farm and make something else. The tech tree is quite substantial and there are countless ways to build each city. This is no more a puzzle than making a research centric city in Civilization. You build the things that boost that one aspect and reduce the others. Perhaps you need to make more trade-offs in Reus and people don't like that?  The only criticism I have is that after you unlock everything the game is kind of boring.   8/10",

            "review_text": "Let me start off by saying: this game is not for everyone.   However, that being said, I am thoroughly enjoying this game as of right now. I picked it up for $2 and I have no regrets. I do not usually play games like this, so I was a little bit hesitant as to whether or not I would enjoy it, but I can say with absolute certaintity that this game is fun for the right audience.   It plays like an RTS, you have 4 elemental godlike giants that control and shape the planet so that the humans can develop there villages. You need to manage resources and make sure that the villages do not get too greedy otherwise wars will break out (these wars usually don't take too long anyways). Each giant has the ability to create it's own biome, as well as their own resources. It's the little things that matter, but I enjoyed that even though you would use the same giant to create plants or animals, it would spawn different plants or animals depending on what biome you are using (e.g. with the same giant you could place chickens in the forest biome and kangaroo rats in the desert biome).  As an incentive to keep playing, there is a levelling up system. The more you level up the more resources you unlock in terms of plants and animals, which is a good way to keep the player motivated. One thing that I disagreed with is that you also have to level up to unlock different play times; for example, you start out with 30 minute trials and once you reach level 2 you're allowed to use 60 minute games, etc. I would have preferred if you could unlock every game time from the beginning. However, Freeplay mode is unlocked at the beginning, which is a nice addition. In Freeplay you don't have to worry about helping the humans build a certain amount of projects in the allotted time period, but you also don't level up or unlock anything in Freeplay.  TL;DR if you're looking for a fun, godlike RTS game to pass the time with then this is a great game to pick up, especially if it is on sale. If you're looking for an RTS with a little bit more depth to it, you may want to pass on this one.   8/10",

Even after the tutorials, there are loads of things to unlock (which you unlock by trying different styles of play) and tons of things to learn. The game is very good about encouraging experimentation. Even the tutorials will say things like, 'Experiment with X,' so you learn without losing any sense of exploration or control.  The in-game achievements each correspond to a Steam achievement, and they all encourage different play styles. One might be, 'End an era with only one village,' and another might be, 'End the game with six co-existant villages.' If you get both of these achievements, you have played two very different games.  It's hard to explain what makes the game so fun. However, I know half the fun is in learning the game for yourself, so I won't try to spoil that for you.

I would only use this when I have unlocked everything.  Overall I like this game. The graphics is nice and the UI is quite easy to use. I will recommend this game if you like to think a bit, specially when it comes to getting the best combination of plant, animal and mineral.",

            "review_text": "Reus is... something that begs a total edit of my original review. Before, I thought it was a 'good little time waster', a 'frustrating case of something that should have been so much cooler'. Quite simply, I had missed the most amazing part of the game and I've since found it, meaning that I can't not change my opinion.  Reus is actually really, really fun once you sink your teeth into it. The only thing I didn't realise was that, where I thought I had got to the marrow of it before, I was still gnawing my way through the bare bones. They were pretty tasty bones to be honest; tasty enough that I thought they would be the main gameplay... well you know what they say about assumptions, this one certainly came back to bite me.  So what actually IS Reus? It's a puzzle-strategy game that looks like a god game. On the surface it looks like a simple progression from the stone age to the space age (or, if your whims are so inclined, maybe they stay in the stone age); and the 'god game' elements seemed to just revolve around plonking down resources for the humans to use and then slapping them around with earthquakes and muck bombs if they do something you don't want them to do. You start with a bare and barren planet, and you use four giants with powers over the environment (ocean, mountain, forest and swamp) to create biomes, creatures, plants and minerals; then you grow and evolve those natural resources for the humans to use (or sometimes abuse) while trying to shape the growth of humans so that they unlock the next round of resources. The other thing to note with giants is that, each time you get the humans to complete a project, the humans send you an ambassador and that ambassador will work with one of your giants to unlock further abilities.  However, that's just the SURFACE. In all its glory, Reus is a progressive strategy puzzle game where you have to solve the puzzle theoretically beforehand, then progress through the stages in-game to reach your predetermined solution (dealing with any disasters which you hadn't set in motion; like that mad scientist who wants you to destroy the Bluerock Tribe even though you need them to finish their shrine so you can give the mad scientist his new reptiles to play with...). In other words, you have to think something like a god seemingly would; knowing the details of Your Great Plan and slowly convincing the humans to give you the tools needed to implement it.  That's very abstract, but remember the example of the mad scientist? Well, each time the humans complete a project for the first time, it unlocks a new species you can add to the world. So if you want to get a mad scientist so you can unlock its associated species, then you need to factor in ALL of its requirements - that includes creating a sacrificial village in this case since destroying a village is one of the requirements to complete that project. You might have to give the humans certain resources, impress them with Awe, start wars (and probably end them too to make sure that the chosen village wins), directly interfere with global trade or learning to make sure that a given village takes the lead in that category... there's a lot to consider when you're a god. Each species is used differently by the humans; they all give common resources but different combinations of resources have different results. So in a kind of psuedo-Chaotic (as in Chaos Theory, not dark gods of destruction) algebra, you shape the game world the humans make use of the resources you give them so that you can give them the next lot, and the next lot, and the next lot until you get them to complete that project and unlock that new species (which has been the goal of thousands of years of evolution).  That's a big part of the game. Naturally you only start out wit a RELATIVELY small number of species - but this is where the game tricked me, because you still get a LOT of species to start with. Like, hundreds. And then there's another couple of hundred to unlock... but in that first hundred or so species, there are symbioses and interactions enough to make a thriving world; so I assumed that the unlocks were 'endgame' content to polish off the basic systems.  Nope. Not even close. The unlocks build, and build; not just with extra layers of unlocks but also with 'tiers' (which you can only unlock with certain combinations of ambassadors). You don't just need to unlock all the species, you also have to create a world that can sustain them and make sure - so if you want the coffea tree to caffeinate your mad scientist in order that he can stay up all night and do astrology; then you have to get certain things happening in the world to be able to make a coffea tree.  In other words, you're eventually going to need a spreadsheet. At the start, Reus looks like it will work if you just add a bit of this and a dash of that and then see what comes out at the end. However, the truth is that if you want to unlock everything, sooner or later you're going to have to really seriously stop and plan the whole pathway to get there. You need to know what the humans need, in what order and in what combination, to make a certain project; and you also need to remember that in order to get some species thriving in the world you'll have to give up on the others that won't help your path.  Yes, that's right, to fully play this game you have to move past the 'I want everything in a glorious utopia!' thinking that's immediately obvious to new players; and start thinking about your planet as a means to an end. It's not that species are mutually exclusive - every species will work with every other species - but rather, the requirements for some species will preclude you getting other species because you simply won't have enough room to get both. Whether it's not having enough room on the planet, or not having enough room on your giants, getting to the marrow of this game means coming to terms with the sheer number of possible pathways available, and then figuring out which ones you want to pursue.  That's why I I invoke Chaos Theory to explain Reus. Einstein summed it up pretty well: 'Life is like a game of dice - if you know all the variables, your throwing force and the wind and the room's air pressure and the weight of the dice and everything; then you can roll a 6 every time'. In Reus, you DO know all the variables - that's why there's an in-game link to the wiki. I missed that bit in the tutorial because I was having too much fun making fish, but if I had paid attention I would have seen how much more complexity there is in Reus.  And then there's in-game challenges - scenarios where you can only use so many of one ambassador type. Scenarios on a strict time-limit (all games are timed, but some of the challenges make it a real race against the clock). Scenarios where whole branches of the 'tech tree' are closed and you have to come up with a creative way to replace them... the more you play, the more complexity you find.  And my gosh it's fun to explore that complexity. If you happen to be a completionist, or if you really like problem solving, then Reus gives you a really nice challenge to sink your teeth into. If you don't like complicated maths or grinding, then this probably isn't your kind of game - there is a big chunk of repetition involved, although there are ways to minimise it some missions simply won't work any other way except starting from scratch on a very specific path. That said, if you do have that urge to totally control history and like working with really complex, abstracted challenges; then Reus is still a great hobby - not just a time-waster, but an investment of loads and loads of time into possibly the greatest sense of satisfaction for completing a challenge that you'll eve find in a game.",

            "review_text": "Reus is probably my favorite god-game of the past decade.  At its core, the game is something of a 2D (or really, technically 1D) Sim City RTS. You cannot directly control humanity, but you create and arrange resources in order to help them thrive. Villages need Food, Wealth, and Tech, which can be gained in various combinations from Animal, Plant, and Mineral resources.  It may not be obvious from the screenshots, but the planet is divided up into individual tiles. Each tile can only be occupied by one resource or building at a time, though you can usually 'overwrite' a tile's contents.  You direct your four giants (Ocean, Rock, Forest, Swamp) to terraform the world's surface and to place resources on specific tiles. Eventually humans will settle near a resource, reserving several contiguous tiles as a town square, and setting up borders a certain distance from the square. As a village develops, the borders will be pushed back, opening up additional tiles for the village to use.  Most of the game's progression is context-sensitive.  Giants have vague powers, such as 'Create Exotic Animal,' but the TYPE of animal is determined by which biome (Forest, Swamp, Desert, Mountain, Ocean) the power is cast upon.   Individual resources may grant bonuses depending on what occupies the adjacent tiles (Salt is more useful if there is a different mineral right next to it).  Giants are able to upgrade the attributes of certain resources. For example, the Swamp Giant is able to increase the amount of Tech provided by any plant tile. Improving aspects in this way unlocks the ability to upgrade the resource to a more valuable/effective (but often more specialized) resource. By manipulating aspects, you can develop Blueberries into either Strawberries or an Apple Tree. Each of those choices also has branching upgrades with different bonuses. In order to keep the choices from getting overwhelming, certain upgrades must be unlocked with achievements.  There are two separate classifications of animals, two of minerals, and two of plants. With all the valid combinations of resource-types and biomes, there are 25 possible entry-level resources, each with various upgrade paths.  A village's 'type' is determined by whether the town square is planted on Forest, Swamp, or Desert tiles. This will determine what sort of civic projects the villagers will want to build (Forest emphasizes agriculture, Desert emphasizes wealth, and Swamp emphasizes technology).  Villages will occasionally decide to construct specialty buildings. In order to successfully complete these projects, the village must reach a certain quota of Food, Wealth, and Tech (or other factors) within a predetermined length of time. It's worth it to help villages reach these goals, because they unlock achievements and award you a village ambassador. Each ambassador can be assigned to one of your giants, who will as a result unlock (or strengthen) a creation or aspect power. The type of power affected is determined by what type of village provided the ambassador.  Each village has a Greed meter. When a village acquires resources too rapidly, the Greed meter will fill, encouraging that village to attack neighbors (or the giants!). This is disruptive to your ability to efficiently and effectively develop these communities within the time limit (Once time runs out, your accomplishments are judged and you are allowed to continue playing, but some achievements must be reached while the clock is still ticking).  The real meat of this game comes from trying to shuffle your resources around within a village's borders in order to maximize context-specific bonuses, because the project the village wants to build just requires SO MUCH of a given resource (or several!) that it needs to be your singular goal. Except it's your multiple goal, because your other villages are also trying to build their own projects, and you can't upgrade this mineral over here until that giant walks over there and casts that aspect upgrade on it (Did I mention the giants have to walk to the tiles where you want them to take action? They're not fast). Since different projects have different dependencies, it's often necessary to maintain at least one of each type of village (Forest, Desert, and Swamp) to ensure a variety of ambassadors (and, by extension, upgrades).  Reus has vibrant art assets and a pleasant soundtrack. The game is fairly easy to pick up but the depth of it might catch you off-guard. You can also choose from a variety of modifiers (such as planet's size or a speed boost for your giants) when starting a new game. Some of these modifiers prevent you from unlocking high-level achievements, but they are a nice way to get a head start in what can easily turn into a several-hour session.  If you like Populous, Sim City, or Black &amp; White, I would recommend giving this game a try.",

I haven't had a strategy game force me to think about my approach to strategy for a long time and it's certainly well appreciated - delightfully the game also gives you time to experiment and adapt your approach as you learn what does and does not work, but not enough time that you won't be experiencing failure every so often.

I do not recommend this game for people who rarely play them or who aren't used to them. This game is way too challenging for my taste, but it may be appropriate for more skilled players. The impression the videos gave me was that the game was cute and easy going, up until war broke out among the neighboring tribes, but the needs between the villages are so demanding that I could not keep up. I was very over whelmed. I really admire how the tutorials eased you into the gameplay, but it didn't do a good enough job of preparing you for managing multiple things at once because once I got into the actual game, I felt thrown into disorder. The fewer number of villages you have, the easier it is. I tried to limit myself to only two villages, by not giving the requirements for them to spawn. However, regardless of this, they were still popping up! I had to run around maintaining four or five different villages, and I thought it would be easier than that but it just seemed to be too much.  The biggest thing that made this game so difficult to me is sort of an infinite cycle. Each village has a project it wants to be built that needs to be completed in a certain amount of time. In order to complete the project, the village needs so many resources (food, wealth, or tech). In order to increase the amount of resources, you have to spawn things like animals, herbs, plants, mines, ect that will yield the desired resource. However, to get enough resources, you need enough space within the village borders to spawn them. The villages will expand their territory automatically over time but after several different playthroughs, my villages expanded extremely slowly and in most cases, they just stopped all together and barely expanded. I simply had no more room to spawn anything else, therefore I couldn't get anymore resources than what I had. Even when I would with apply 'upgrades' to make the items produce more resources, which are called attributes in the game, I still sometimes wouldn't meet the quota. So with insufficient resources, the time limit would run out, and I wasn't able to complete the projects the people wanted done. This was especially hard when I had four different tribes to tend to who all wanted projects completed. These demands and limitations really restricted gameplay. There's just a lot going on at once in this game that's hard to handle.",

            "review_text": "I cannot, in the game's current form, recommend this title.   It has an intersting premise and a fun art style. The game looked incredibly promising. However, there were a number of issues that prevented me from enjoying it enough to get further than the second tutorial.   The controls are absolutely abysmal. It requires a mouse output to control and activate things. However, rotating and adjusting the view for the game requires the use of the arrow keys. Not WASD, arrows. The abilities have a hotkey function already bound to each one, there's no rearranging or organizing them. The left hand homerow and first row contain the game's shortcut commands.   In order to play the game most optimally, you would need your right hand on the mouse, your left on the quick triggers, and a third hand to control the arrows.   This certainly wouldn't have been any sort of issue if the game developers had allowed you to remap controls, something that is becoming progressively more standard in PC titles. This is not offered here. I would have been happy to continue trying the game if I could map controls to use WASD and the number rows for view-movement and shortcuts.   The game seemed interesting enough to at the least try playing with these confusing controls. However, the game forces you to go through the tutorial in the beginning, there's absolutely no skipping it. so if you're a play-and-learn kinda person, that's not an option. Further, the tutorials are painfully linear. After I planted an ocean and a forest, while I was waiting for fruit to be planted, I had the ocean giant go create another ocean. I soon had two oceans and four forests, though I was primarily using jut one. When the next setting, the desert, came into play, the location I placed it had the forest and desert bordering one another. This either caused some odd interactions, or the game is just that difficult to handle and understand what is gong on. The game wants you to have one ocean, one forest, and a desert far away from them. No room for legitimate learning, just do each command forced upon you. There's also no (at least no easy and readily apparent) way to go back through the dialogue box.   They kindly label each patch with the wealth and food it produces, but that's about it. It makes reference of project patches, but nothing stood out as a 'project patch.' It also introduced symbiosis and specialization which had almost identical symbols in the text of the dialogue box. Remember how I mentioned there's no way to go back? It would have been great so I could reread the bits about project patches and symbiosis and specialization. Generally speaking, you want the player to be able to review things during the tutorial. Apparently not.   This game might very well be a great and interesting game. However, the tutorial is unhelpful, not all of the UI is clearly labeled and legible at a glance, and the octopus-based control system means that I have to awkwardly use my left hand in a traditionally right hand placement, and just forego the use of shortcuts altogether.   Start with letting us remap controls. Then maybe the tutorial will be easier to bear and pay better attention to, letting us actually get to the game.",

            "review_text": "Story: There is a theme, but not really a story, which is fine for this game. You are the planet, and you control four sentient giants that place resources to develop villages and unlock new resources. Presumably after your giants fall asleep, the world keep developing and at some point annihilate each other through thermonuclear war, which is why you wake up to a wasteland each time.  Gameplay: I think Reus' mechanics stand out as the reason why I would come back to this game. There is a race against time to get as much prosperity as you can, but grow a village too fast and it will get greedy. On top of that, random developments means there is never one cookie cutter 'best' option, and the ambassador system gives you the hard choice of picking which upgrades you want (and which ones you forsake). Having said that, I dislike the progression system, where you have to get achievements to unlock higher level resources. Playing two hours to unlock one achievement so you can use the resource that it unlocks to play another two hours to unlock another achievement is not fun. It is possible to get all of the achievements with a minimal number of well-planned playthroughs, but a casual player will not accomplish this.  UI/Controls: The controls work fine, but the camera can be a pain to manage at times, and it would be a lot better if there was an option to queue up commands. One pain point for me is that the game doesn't tell me which high level natural resources I have access to and what they do until I actually transmute into them, so I often found myself alt-tabbing between the game and the online wiki (which has quite a few errors) when planning what to build.  Graphics/Audio: Not much to say here. There's some pleasant background music to listen to as you play, and the animal sprites can be fun to watch if you zoom in enough.  Replayability: I have mixed feelings on this. On the one hand, the game mechanics around developments means that each playthrough will be different, and you can make it even more different if you choose different ambassador setups. Also, the one-hour challenges that appear after you unlock all of the achievements are a reason to keep at the game. However, after playing through the 2-hour era a couple of times, I felt that the minor variations in each playthrough were not enough of an interesting new experience to keep me playing.  Summary: I would cautiously recommend this game to people who like god games. People who like optimization in games will enjoy the mechanics of this game, but otherwise the slow progression system will likely cause players to burn out.",

However, the game fails to deliver any excitement at all. Everything is so slow-paced that it drove me insane after 10 minutes of playing. If you move your giant somewhere you didnt mean to, and you have to get him back, you will likely starve behind your computer because those giant slowpokes are basically satan's snail spawns. The game gets boring really quick and having to redo a levelhas never been so anoying. Also, the first few intro levels are so low paced that i wouldn't be suprised if you don't even bother finishing them and just drop the game entirely.  If you're a braindead zombie with enough time on your hands to cure worldhunger, please go cure woldhunger. If your not capable at that, then playing this game is the next best thing to do with you time. If you like to achieve anything at all in a game within an hour then this game isn't for you.

The villages will just scrap that project and take on another. I enjoyed helping the villagers not only for the power granting ambassadors that join you, but also for the serene pleasure of watching the villages grow from tents around a well into bustling cities. As the villages become more prosperous, lots of villagers and buildings populate the town and improve in appearance. However, a perfect utopia is hard to achieve. Villages with abundant resources are prone to greed which leads them to war with their neighbors or even your titans. At the end of each era (game) your achievements unlock advanced plants and animal types with powerful bonuses but with more specialized uses. Reus is well worth the ten bucks.

Currently there are only about Five different environments: Ocean, Desert, Forest, swamp, mountain (with specific resources for each) and only three different types of 'Villages': Forest, desert and swamp. Game would benefit in the long term with a little more diversity and more content.  At 10 dollars though it's DEFINITELY worth a purchase.

Reus is an strategy game based on resource generation, you play the role of 4 giants in a wasteland with different abilities of creation, you may use these abilities to terraform the wasteland into habitable land, like forests, swamps or even deserts. You may then create resources in the land, like plants or animals, to attract human settlers, whom will start projects that require certain amonts of different resources within their territory, like food or wealth. You may boost the resources you create for them by procuring synergy beween them, like putting domestic animals near fruit for example; this is essential since human territory is limited and you need to take advantage of every tile. To this the game adds other concepts like humans getting too greedy with their resources, or blocked abilities that may only be obtained by procuring human ambassadors from different kinds of civilizations by completing projects. Reus is a basic strategy game on the surface, with great complexity hidden to those who are not seeking it, making it ideal for all audiences, from casual to hardcore. If you are familiar with this kind of game, Reus doesn't shine with new ideas, it does, however, shine with perfect execution and design.",

Upgrades to the basic improvements get pretty extensive as you unlock more and more, and more and more strategy is required. To this end I find that the game paces itself pretty well. You don't have control over humans in this game, so trying to manage them into developing further while not letting them mess up everything is the name of the game.

Well, if you don't mind seeing all of your hard work go away, that is. My problem with Reus is that it's actually very restrictive. The creators had a divine plan for how various minerals and animals work to make the best bonuses, and as the game gets longer, the ability to create variety or personality vanishes.

From personal experience during the first four hours of so I had an absolute blast trying out different combinations of powers and land types. It's quite enjoyable to unlock new structures and lands that can then help you achieve further unlocks.  Unfortunately there is a mechanic where towns will actively go to war if they suddenly get too many resources, and if ther aren't any towns to attack they will prey on your titans. At first this was a nice challenge and forced me to try to up danger levels as well put the titans other skills to use. However when building upgrades are on a time limit you're forced into the position of increasing resources and boundaries, but then if the resources you need don't produce danger you have to put up with beating down warring jackasses for the next couple of minutes until they finally simmer down.  It is unbelivably frustrating and it is unfortunate because up until that moment it was a fun game. Perhaps there was some secret method or technique I hadn't discerned to make the game less aggravating in the longer modes? I think it bears repeating that Reus is looks amazing and the general gameplay is interesting and enjoyable - up to a point.

It's casual friendly and it can be played without having to dedicate huge stretches of time. You can put in 30 minutes or down for a 6 hour session and accomplish something either way.  Reus is the very definition of an achievement hunter game, where your game mode choices are a set timed level or the free play option.  It's very important to understand this, because your enjoyment depends on your approach to the game. In Reus you play either a 30-, 60- or 120-minute round with a gameplan decided before you even start for unlocking predetermined achievements, then you end that round and start anew. There's no grand strategy per se, you don't build anything to last. If you can accept this and adjust, you can have some really enjoyable times with Reus and I would highly recommend it to you. This point needs to be reiterated: you will have to be going for achievements. There's no choice, really. You unlock the stuff you build through clearing them, meaning if you don't bother with them then you *will not* progress in the game. It's designed around that concept, of doing one or a set of achievements per run. Some achievements are really tricky, and if you're partial to that kind of stuff you will definately find some of these challenges to your liking!  If you're looking for a Civilization-, Sim City- or Paradox Interactive-style game, this is not it. Unless you do a 'free play' run, your upgrade limit to your four giants, your builders, means you *have* to specialize in one or two areas. You will not be able to min-max your towns, but with time running out fast you wouldn't be able to anyway. Decide what you want out of that run and specialize your giants to achieve that goal. Once you've unlocked everything, however, there's a 'free play' option that allows you to get every upgrade to your giants. You could easily spend 15-20 hours min-maxing a huge world that way, and absolutely love it! Problem is, the people who don't give a damn about achievements are forced to sit through hours upon hours of achievement hunting to get there, and the people who only care about achievements are done by that point.  Additionally, a large part of the game has been randomized for some reason, from the quality of upgrades to your buildings (applying aspects to natural resources) to where your peoples build their towns and what projects they undertake. Having them place a town one, two or three spaces wrong can be a huge source of irritation, and it will lead to 'save-load-load-load'-situations for the OCD crowd of gamers. Also, town projects give bonuses, sometimes really good and sometimes really useless depending on what kind of run you're going for. So if you've upgraded your giants for the plant and/or mineral tech tree and your towns insist on making animal projects, then you can either destroy the town and hope the next one will build in the same spot as well as hope they make another project, or you can just say 'screw it' and make the project to just not waste even more time.  If someone tells you that the game encourages adjustment to your peoples' randomness, they're lying. There's no adjusting in the game, because once you've upgraded a giant, it's not going to change. You get four upgrades per giant, and to get the best buildings available for each game mode time frame, you need to know beforehand what to go for.  Runs get very messy very quick, and if you see the randomness as ruining your plans, you should stay away. If you look at it as just another layer of added difficulty, it's surmountable.  When it comes to some of the more technical problems with the game, know that windowed mode tends to crash the game eventually. The game also has weird crashing problems when trying to move the window from one screen to the other. Also, the ingame text does not scale well and can become hard to read. The game can also stop working from too much happening at once, or sometimes just from having been running for too long, so make sure to have auto save active and frequently save manually.  You will also notice ingame bugs happening once in a while, like your giants getting stuck and become unresponsive after trying to do an action. Just save and reload and they'll start working again. Also, sometimes your giants attacks against angry mobs or armies won't work, and that can have dire consequences for your runs, but I've found no way of rectifying this other than reloading an older save and hoping the town won't send out that army or angry mob again.  In conclusion:  I mostly enjoyed playing Reus, partly because I'm a huge fan of strategy games where you build and develop your surroundings. It's a flawed game, however, with bugs, randomness and imbalances that can bog down an otherwise great run. However, for me, the upsides and the good times outweighed the bad.",

Mechanics that seemed convoluted in training actually add an interesting level of difficulty and strategizing during actual play.  Overall, I'd say that Reus is a very well-designed strategy game, with a good progression and a lot of variety in objectives which encourages you to explore all of the different play strategies. Depending on whether or not you use the pause option, it can be very zen or a bit more intense.  However, I really prefer the shorter game duration, as I feel like 1h+ runs can feel like they're dragging on for way too long when things are not going as you had planned. I'm not sure yet what that means for me and this game in the future - but in any case, it has already provided me with a solid 10 hours of entertainment.",

            "review_text": "A cautious recommendation. I do enjoy this game, but it's just not enticing me to come back to it.   An overview of the gameplay first. Reus is a game where you control several giants who can terraform the land, with the ability to create things like forests, oceans, mountains, deserts, etc. Once you create one of these areas, nomads will move in and settle cities. Once these nomads are settled, you need to nurse them by giving them food, wealth, and science, while trying to stop them from getting greedy and having wars.  Every 'biome' has a different type of city. For example, forests house cities that require food to grow. Deserts create cities that require wealth, and swamp cities require science, or knowledge. Each giant specializes in one of things. The forest giant can make bushes and trees for food, the rock giant can create minerals for wealth, and the swamp giant makes herbs for science. The water giant can make animals, which contribute to food. Most giants can do something for each of these. The rock giant can create minerals for science, the swamp giant animals for wealth.  Cities need these things to build 'projects', which allow them to expand. These projects have time limits in which you need to get a certain amount of food, science, or wealth. Every project you finish rewards you with one of the cities' respective ambassadors. These ambassadors unlock (or power up) abilities of your giants.  Giants have more abilities then just creating bushes or minerals; they can also infuse things with certain attributes. Some attributes raise the food of bushes, or the science of minerals. There are three strengths of attributes, normal, potent and greater. Some of these tile improvements can transmute into better versions once they are infused with a certain attribute. Blueberries can transmute into strawberries, strawberries into pear trees. The greater transmutations require stronger attributes.  So with transmutations out of the way, there is another important mechanic about tile improvements. This is called symbiosis. Symbiosis is something that raises the amount of food/wealth/science an improvement gives under certain conditions. Some minerals give double wealth when near another mineral, some animals give extra food while near berries. This is extremely important, considering you only have a small amount of tiles in the city to work with. You need to take advantage of this to maximize the city's resources.  You do not want to make a city too large too fast, though, because then they'll get greedy. When cities get greedy, they are going to start wars with other civlizations, and potentially destroy them. They might also start to take your giants for granted and attack them. Don't worry though, because the swamp and rock giants have attacks. You can use these attacks to destory armies, riots, and even cities themselves if they become problems.   There are a couple of ways to regulate greed in this game. The first is to very slowly give them resources. Their greed is raised when the number of resources they have available is higher then the amount of resources they are currently using by 20. The second way is to infuse animals near the city with the attribute of danger. Certain amounts of danger with stop their greed from rising completely. Be careful, though, because too much danger will cause the city to slowly die.  If their greed does rise, you can simply humiliate them by dealing damage to the city to lower their greed. Make sure your attacks won't kill them, though.   Something you might have noticed from the overview of the game is that it is about keeping balance. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it gets kind of slow sometimes. I found myself waiting quite a bit for their resources in use to rise so I could return to optimizing my tile improvements, without them getting greedy.   This is a very casual game. The meat of it is trying to develop the cities certain ways in a 30/60 minute time limit to get new transmutations and achievements. If you are the kind of person who seeks out to have every unlockable in the game, then this isn't too bad. I personally didn't quite like it, but I do enjoy unlocking the new transmutations, which let you make your cities bigger from the larger boosts they give, allowing you to get larger achievements.  My main problem with the game is that I never really had a drive to play it more. I do enjoy this game, and whenever I play it I have fun, but I feel like I haven't got anything worthwhile left to do. The transmutations, which I am interested in unlocking, do not say what you need to do to get them, like the achievements do. I'd assume that getting an achievement also unlocks a corresponding transmutation, but this seems kind of inconsistent for me.   Another thing I really don't like is that you can't see how much time you have left for your particular game. As I've said before, you can choose between a 30 minute session and a 60 minute one. You can also play an unlimited game with no time limit, but this doesn't contribute to your achievements.  At the end of the time limit, your giants will go to sleep one by one. This is really annoying, because the time it takes and the order they go to sleep is all random. Many times I need to place just one improvement or one transmutation when the giant I need goes to sleep, resulting in me having to start a whole other game for the achievement I was just about to get.   There are lots of things I like about this game, though. I always enjoy keeping balance between two greedy cities, or working to optimize my tile improvements to help the civilization with their projects.   In conclusion, this is a fun game that is just too casual to be fully recommended. There are a few problems I have with the game that takes away from the experience, but if this sounds like something for you, go right on ahead. There's lots of ways to develop your cities, so each game stays pretty fresh, although sometimes the requirements of the achievements are quite limiting.  ",

            "review_text": "It feels good to be back and reviewing Reus. Let’s begin.  I – Story [7/10]  Reus is a simulation, god game from Abbey Games. Story-wise there’s not much to Reus. The player takes control of four elemental giants and uses their powers to indirectly influence humanity developments and expansions. It is very much a choose your own adventure style of game and it worked rather well with this one.  II – UI [10/10]  The user interface in Reus can be pretty intimidating if you rush in before you get a decent handle on what you’re doing. Not to worry, as the game provides you with an excellent tutorial to walk you through it. Once you’ve played through said tutorial, the world will be your oyster as far as Reus is concerned. Everything you need to see is plainly displayed on the screen. If you’re not sure what something is just from the icon, hovering over it with the pointer for a few seconds will tell you all that you need to know.  III – Gameplay [9/10]  Getting things to happen that you actually want to happen in Reus can be challenging at times. As I stated above, you cannot control any humans directly. You are left to influence any advances through using your god-like powers and shaping the world around them. In order to get things done, you’ll have to experiment around and see exactly what things will do in what locations. It’s all very much trial and error.  Additionally, a balance must be kept between the giants and humanity. If you give too many resources to the humans, the can grow greedy. A high level of greed can lead to villages warring with each other or even with the giants themselves. There are several methods you can employ to keep the greed level in check. Certain combinations of symbioses with animals and minerals/plants can raise the village’s danger level. This makes the humans wary and keeps them too busy to get very greedy. Alternatively, you can sync up certain animals/minerals/plants to generate awe. This also keeps the humans in check and humble. Attacking the villages with the giants can cause the humans to become humble once more, but, on occasion, you may be left with no choice but to lay waste to their village in it’s entirety.  Ultimately, it is your call on how you want things to take shape, but you’ll have to lead it carefully in that direction.   IV – Content [8/10]  There is a seriously large amount of content in Reus and it will take you quite some time to discover/unlock all of it. There are five types of biomes for humanity to settle and explore. There are a great many varieties of animals, minerals, and vegetation alike. The giants all have their fair share of powers, but I feel like there could have been a little bit more content in that department. Cultivating a world is hard work with a limited tool box, but it still gets the job done in an enjoyable manner.  V – Visual [10/10]  The artwork in Reus is hand-drawn and beautiful. The giants are all very detailed and unique. All the animal and plant life you’ll encounter throughout the game is likewise intricately detailed the more you zoom in on it. Reus is eye candy for sure and it makes the game that much better.  VI – Audio [10/10]  Music appears intermittently throughout Reus, but when it does, it’s fantastic. It’s very lighthearted, even during combat sequences, and often incorporates overtones of victory and accomplishment. The sound effects are, likewise, good. Whether your using your powers to help humanity or put it back in it’s place, the sounds are wonderful. They are also relative to how closely zoomed in you are on the map.  VII – Overall [9/10]  Overall, Reus is a great game with deep gameplay and balanced learning curve. I picked this one up during the Steam Holiday Sale (what a bargain), but I wouldn’t have felt bad for paying full price on this one. If you’re looking for a weekend activity, Reus is a good choice.",

            "review_text": "Ok this game probably won't garner much attention. Sure you don't get to shoot or slash anyone to bits and sure there isn't any multiplayer at all but the game itself has its highlights. First what is this game about. To strongly put it, its similar to any other game that is in the similar genre as the sims. The game gives you some control but what seems like you have control turns into a cluster@#$% of chaos if you don't manage it. In the game you , the player, are the planet. You start out barren, no water, no life, no plants, and because of this as the planet your power is weakening. With what power you have left you summon the giants in effort to bring back life to your barren body. Thats pretty much the jist of it. The gameplay is fairly solid and easy as you use the mouse to both direct your giants and turn your planet. Now lets talk about the giants. Honestly I love them . They appear powerful as they are giants but at the same time their endearing. The art style, atleast to me, shows that. We have the Rock Giant who can raise mountains, and place minerals, The forest giant who can grow forests, and certain plants, The Ocean giant who provides water and animal life, and then the Swamp giant who's a combination of the forestand ocean giant. These are the players tools and with these lovable giants you create a lush world for which , you guessed it, Humans to live on. Now remember that control I mentioned before? Well this is where you lose that control. Humans are an indepedant character of the game and create villages in deserts, forests, as well as swamps. To the planet they're beneficial as well as problematic. They help you as well as your giants grow in power but when they get too greedy they ruin everything attacking any other nearby village. As the pseudo god to these human with your giant tools its up to you to provide humans with food, natura, technology, and wealth. These are the things that each village needs in order to succeed in projects, which when completed , increase one of the four parameters as well as creates a ' giant ambassador ' to which the giant picks up and let it ride on his head and unlocking its ( locked ) latent powers.   In a way the game is both one of those big sandbox, life simulators, that has a hint of strategy. Deciding which giants gets an ambassador to unlock it's powers as certain powers can help you greatly and other ones can really do nothing until you unlock something else. Also did I mention that if you wanted to you can just have your giant just completely smash a village?   Which leads to my problems with the game, I want multiplayer. If this game had multiplayer I'm sure people would flock to it. I mean maybe some nice game modes like who can build their civilzation the fastest; A Pvp where both players struggle to build a village and have their villages fight one another; or even just a fighting mini game with the giants, hell I'd even settle for co-op in building a world. This game, with so much potential, lacks this.   Now another thing that bothers me is the Human AI in the game particularly how they settle their villages. I mean I'd plant a blueberry bush here and the bloody village ends up spawning in an area where I had plans to place something. I mean honestly don't randomly spawn the villages. Just give me a pop up saying the humans are settling and allow me to place the village down myself. Its not a giant issue but its just something that urks me just alittle.   Overall the game is still fun. The designs of the giants are great and lovable, and the gameplay is simple enough to understand until you get to the more complex bits such as upgrading things and trying to fullfill the projects that the humans start. If you love Sim games I recommend this to you , if you aren't into the cute and adorable things then no. I give this game a solid 4 out of 5 on my rating. It would be a 5 if it just had any form of multiplayer.",
