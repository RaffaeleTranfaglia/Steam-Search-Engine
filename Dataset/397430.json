You get to meet many racist locals who discriminate you based on your appearance and you can work as a slave by making countless pizzas for an insufferable anthropomorphic tree stump. 10/10. Highly recommended.",

            "review_text": "I played this, or rather, the original game, Logical Journey of the Zoombinis, when I was very young, and I can remember absolutely adoring every moment of it. I still have the CD! I tried to install it on Windows 7 and you can only get so far before the graphics card just errors out and displays everything in inverted colours or worse.  This remake, while close to what a Zoombinis game ought to be, is not what I had hoped it would be.  While the graphics have been updated to a very high degree and the animations have been redrawn etc for all the characters, and allowed for proper resolutions higher than 640 x 480, the charm of that delightful original game has sadly been lost, and that's really what I wanted to see again. It's a shame because the graphical update is simply fantastic, and the inclusion of the ridiculously enthusiastic announcer and other voice and musical content from the original game is spot-on. However, there's just no charm to it any more.   The Zoombinis themselves move at the pace of a crippled snail - it's become a chore just to watch them move to the next place - and there's no sound for their footsteps like in the original. Zoombinis with feet would have steps, the wheels would make engine noises, springs... spring noises. When they ride the rollercoaster in the crystal caverns, they would yell out 'wahey' or 'yippee' on a successful run, and it just felt so lively and excitable.  The issue with the charm of the graphical update is that the Zoombinis themselves suffer from the TV Tropes entry 'Conspicuously Light Patch'. This is where, because of their drawn style, they stand out way too much from the beautifully drawn backgrounds, as the obviously only animated figures, whereas in the original, they had lighter outlines and shades to match the background, like they were meant to be there. Here they stand out so much it's almost painful to look at.  What's ACTUALLY painful to look at is when the Zoombinis walk over a patch of the background that's actually in the foreground. In the original game, at the Crystal Caverns, it was possible to see the mine-cart Zoombini travel behind the supporting struts of the track. In this release, the characters are always, without fail, on the topmost layer of the foreground. It's particularly noticeable because of the way they stand out so much from the background, too.  The worst thing about the game is the hotspots. Good luck trying to enter your name on the very first screen of the game. I couldn't until I restarted the game in windowed mode. Perhaps resolution plays into it too. I'm not sure. I just know that you will have issues clicking on certain things.  At least Mudball Wall survived. ... well, partially. As I said, the Zoombinis' walking speed cripples the pace of the game when you have to wait 20 seconds each for them to get into position. Maybe I'm being nitpicky. The puzzles are sound and, well - puzzling! Especially on the harder difficulties. It's a decent game; I do recommend Zoombinis. But I personally wouldn't recommend this specific remake. If you can find a copy of the original and install it without issues, do that instead.",

            "review_text": "This game is a remake of the one of the best educational puzzle game from 90's, Logical Journey of the Zoombinis. Game has keept a lot of thing from original for exaple voices and music. A game have a 12 puzzles what you should solve to help for your Zoombinis reach they goal.  So my verdict  +original voices and music what i think good  +you can create own Zoombinis at the start when combinate a part of body +good educational game for children +trading cards +lot of bonus content +nice graphic style  -not everyone  -a bit short -maybe a bit high price  SO i think nice casual game, what doed for children, but all ages can enjoy this. I checked the classical game and i think, they doed good remake, keept all things from previous game. THis game i think a bit short with 12 puzzle, so the price now for this i think a bit high. But if this got a biger disscount, you have a children or you played this game in original or you like this sort of games, in that time this game be instant buy for you.  9/10",

A very cute remake of a game about helping the zoombinis traverse the land by using their logic and problem solving skills.

Recommended for anyone who is nostalgic about the original or anyone looking for a cute casual puzzle game to play in their down time.",

Here we are almost 20 years later and Zoombinis has now hit Steam with updated graphics and is now playable on modern computers.  Everything that we loved about the game is back including the audio and original voice acting. If you want a nice, casual puzzle game with cute characters and a little bit of humor, you can't go wrong with good ol' Zoombinis. In addition, if you have kids, this is a really good educational game for them.  You even get some cool bonuses just from buying the game, such as the soundtrack, some ringtones for iPhone and Android phones, and wallpapers for your desktop!  Oh, and one more thing...  MORE TOPPINGS!!!",

It's not exactly meant for adults but it's very well executed.  PROS 1. Puzzles are Thematic The puzzles have a theme woven in. It makes the game that much more immersive.  2. Divergent Paths You can take Path A or Path B.  3. Kid Puzzles There is a way to make the game harder, so I would say that if you could probably do pattern matching really well.  4. Interactive Environments You can click on the backgrounds for animations. E.g. Clicking on the fire causes 2 sticks to jump out and start a fire.  CONS 1. You can't Accelerate the Puzzles The Frog and Lilypad puzzle cannot go any faster than the game allows. 16 Zoombinis would take forever to cross.  ",

A little dissapointed that there is no achievements for the game but the game itself brings memories back.  Some of the games are a little slower and the animations are a little off, along with some tweaks to the gameplay, only minor, which help and hinder the game. Overall though, worth getting if you love puzzle games, want your kids to play a fun game which uses patterns, similarities and logic to improve their learning.  Great game, worth getting!!!",

Zoombinis has been reclaimed from the gaming abyss of the past to bring a rush of nostalgia to those who played it in their youth, as well as a challenging puzzle and logic game for children and early teens. The charm this game exudes makes it a delight to play over and over, and the branching path in the middle allows for a mix up of the puzzles each time to prepare to journey.  The Updated art work keeps the charm of the original game, and the soundtrack is exactly how I remember it from 15 odd years ago, and it hasn't lost any of its enjoyment.  I highly recommend this game to Puzzle lovers, Edutainment lovers and to Parents wanting to give their children a charming education game with a lot of heart and replayability.  Zoombinis is just as good now as it was then, and I cannot state enough how good it is to see it back.",

When I saw that Zoombinis was now posted on Steam, I immediately picked it up so I could see for myself if the puzzles were as good as I remembered. I am here to tell you that they might actually be BETTER than I remembered. The game adjusts its difficulty based on how well you are doing. The puzzles are all different and interesting. At higher difficulties, these puzzles can still push even a full grown adult's mind and make you really work for those victories.  And the zoombinis themselves are still adorable and REALLY excited to have some help getting to Zoombiniville. I know this is  technically  an edutainment game, but it was one of the best, and it is still an amazing game to play. Don't wait for a steam sale on this one. Buy it now, because whoever brought it back deserves every penny.",
