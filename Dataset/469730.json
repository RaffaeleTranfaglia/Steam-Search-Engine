            "review_text": "Super Mega Neo Pug has some of the most revolutionary gameplay I have ever witnessed and has a story filled with deep philosophical questions that makes me ask myself about my purpose in life and my humanity. Few games question the players actions in a way that weighs what we believe is right and wrong. This game tackles the biggest issues in our society from the racial quotas of institutions to what defines life and the balance between privacy and protection. As you progress through each level, you see the same situations from a different point of view. Can anyone's actions truly be justified? Can different cultures and ideologies coexist or can peace never be reached among these different groups. From the beginning of this game, you are driven forward with an unsatisfiable lust for money. This game is an endless cycle of failure (just like you) with the definition of victory being up to the player. Is it reaching a new high score or is it unlocking a new character. It does not matter because the choice is for you to make. Whether or not a game as complex and intriguing as Super Mega Neo Pug is worth putting time and effort into, is also up to you. These are simply my thoughts.  Review (not) sponsored by CSGOLotto.",

On a more reviewy note, the music is fun, all you use is spacebar to fly, and you can unlock a pug wearing a sombrero, a sombrero people!!!  I'm considering getting a pug, tying a cape onto it's collar, and putting a sombrero on it's head.",

I had the most fun challenging friends and family, seeing who could get the highest score. This game is really fun and cute.   If you have sensitive eyes or are prone to headaches, I recommend you watch the game video before playing and try to decide if the game may move too fast for your eyes. It is quite fast and can make my eyes blur over at times.",

You die often but I think that just fuels the fire to keep playing so you can get more characters. This game is a lot like flappy bird but with shields and new characters. Definitely will be playing this again.",

Plays like Flappy Bird, only you get to Finger Blast your mouse to 0rgasmic levels of destruction, in order to move half way up the screen, and die after 4 seconds (Hold Mouse).  So I refunded, don't want this boo hoo, yadda yadda....  However, I've come back, I need more of it, its grew on me, it plagued my mind, 'Its got to be better, its me not you' and whilst it isn't like the first, its just as addictive! Well done Dan 'Sir Pugsalot' for another cheap &amp; cheerful game!  Pro's Better menus, good sounds, Improved visuals  Con's No in game controls for Keyboard or Gamepad, Addictive",

You've played far worse games than this, and in short bursts there is some fun to be had, and there's also no denying it's very cheap. Which makes it the perfect bundle game, but I feel even at $1 your money would be better put towards something that's really only entertaining for a few minutes at a time every 6 months or so.",
