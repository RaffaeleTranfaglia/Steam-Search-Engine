            "review_text": "BEFORE BUYING THIS, PLEASE BUY AVEYOND: LORD OF TWILIGHT, AVEYOND: GATES OF NIGHT, AND AVEYOND: THE LOST ORB, IN THAT ORDER. THIS GAME WILL REVEAL MANY PLOT SPOILERS FOR THE PREVIOUS PARTS AND A COHESIVE STORY CAN ONLY BE FORMED WITH THE PLAYING OF THE OTHER 3 GAMES IN THE SERIES. Aveyond: The Darkthrop Prophecy is the fourth and final installment in the 4-part series of games that make up Aveyond 3. Don't start with this one, as you'll be missing TONS of backstory. Instead, buy Lord of Twilight first, Gates of Night second, and The Lost Orb third... And finally this one. Now, I've been following the Aveyond series for several years, back since the first game in 2004 (which doesn't go under the title of 'Aveyond', instead; it's called 'Ahriman's Prophecy', and it's free from their site,  aveyond.com) . I was young, the game was cool, so I stuck with the series. In 2006, the actual Aveyond was released and I was stoked. More of AP? Nice! However, Aveyond 1 was completely different from it's predecessor in the best way possible... Fast forward to today, with me writing this review. Now, I've had this game for a while. Not on Steam, but from somewhere else, so I've played through it a few times before, so this isn't a 'first-time playthrough' review or anything. But without further ado, let's get on to the actual review. Aveyond: The Darkthrop Prophecy is a great game from a great team of people. It's got a ton of pros... But also it's fair share of cons. I'll list them all out for you, dear reader. PROS: +Decent price +Decent gameplay +Great story (if you've been following since Lord of Twilight) +Custom music (not all of the music is build-in RPG Maker music, as one could expect) +Difficulty selection +Nostalgia factor (for the select few who played the first Aveyond) +Combat just works +Dat plot twist at the end (again, you'll have to have played LoT to understand) CONS: -RPG Maker... XP. Before we go any further, I want to explain why this is a con in detail. Aveyond, the series as a whole, while a great series, is all RPG Maker XP. All of it. From Aveyond 1 (not it's prequel Ahriman's Prophecy, however) to this most current one, Aveyond has been an RPG Maker XP game. After 4 years of making games with RPG Maker XP, you think they'd at least move onto RPG Maker VX Ace (which is what I use), but no. Not even a slight upgrade. Don't get me wrong, there isn't nothing wrong with RPG Maker XP itself (besides its dated-ness) but having a whole series of 7 games be all made in a program that was just barely considered 'new' at the time of the first game's release is just baffling. Now back to the rest of the cons... -Cannot change screen resolution -Can be confusing to those who never played any of the other parts of Aveyond 3 -Controls can be awkward -Moves a bit slow All in all, I will recommend this game. But please, before you spend $10 on this, buy the others. At least get Lord of Twilight to start you off.",
