I've already seen several community made levels that were very likely impossible marked as 'easy'.

That's par for the course with me, though, and not a complaint about the game. I play obsessively until I've had enough, then break for a while.

The level editor is simple and easy to use, with the ability to build story into them with NPCs and whatnot giving the game ridiculous longevity.  The game isn't perfect, though. The UI takes a little bit of getting used to, and the combat is pretty lacklustre. Not to mention the game's survival is dependent on the support of its player base.  TL;DR version:  Pros: - Lots of variety in levels - Great to play with friends - Finding new loot is addictive and exciting - Good variety in the different classes  Cons: - Combat leaves a bit to be desired - Can't easily search for specific levels to play with friends",

Community made maps are hit or miss. There's a ton of great content out there, but unfortunately you'll need to wade through quite a bit of clunkers to get to them.   As a single player game, it has a limited life span since each map is pretty much the same monsters/puzzles/traps just in different orders. Once you are able to get multiplayer working for more than 5 minutes, it becomes extremely fun again. I'm not sure if the problem lies with me or the servers, but there were plenty of frustrating moments with either disconnects or just plain not being able to connect at all. The gameplay makes those frustrations worth it though, but beware problems do exist.  Bottom line, this game is definitely worth full price even with the drawbacks, but as always, it's best to wait for a sale.",

I can play for five minutes or get lost in a two-hour binge. The maps are long enough to feel detailed but short enough to complete in one sitting. Combat can get repetitive but with new and better loot dropping here and there, from enemies and chests, I didn't really care; it's good, plain fun. There are four classes with individual spells and special abilities - a fighter, fire mage, ice mage and rogue - but I've only played as an 'Ice Wizard' up to this point without losing any interest or even gaining a desire to try other classes. I'm having too much fun with this one.  There's also a map/adventure/campaign editor where you can create your own landscapes, buildings, villages, etc. etc. You can also script NPCs to talk to the player when he approaches as well as decorate your worlds with trees, rocks, fountains, bookshelves, beds, chairs... You name it. With a touch of detail here and there, worlds come alive. The editor has some rudimentary logic chains and pressure pads so that you can create some quite interesting and complex puzzles, though I'll admit, I haven't delved into that area quite yet.

The premise of the game is to adventure in community-created campaigns, finding keys, unraveling small plots, looting better items, and making your way to fighting the dragon by collecting Dragon Scrolls. It's almost like Shadowrun Returns, but without the developer-created campaign. There are some REALLY good adventures to go on by the community.  However, it's like finding needles in a haystack - the majority of GREAT community-created scenarios are far and few between. Many fall short between amateur DMs and wannabe writers akin to middle school English class. 75% of the adventures you will partake in often have glaring issues like loot balancing, confusing or short level design, awful dialogue and spelling mistakes and more. It seems like anyone can create a dungeon with 5 rooms, 50 potions, tons of easy enemies and enough loot to make the game not much fun.  This game is AMAZING for DM's and really shines in the way of quick pick-up and random co-op play. It falls short in the way that the majority of the content is shallow or just bad. If you dig hard enough, you'll find gold though.",

But: it feels more like a sandbox-title.... with a bad camera, clumsy controls and odd hit/collision-detection. And no storyline, just 'random' maps, with some Steam-achievements thrown in. Yet somehow not rewarding at all, as there is no soul to it. I find it hard to find any feelings for that title. It is just: Meh! (in a bad way)  However, one might find it entertaining for some hours running around and killing every creature on any of the (endless) maps. If you are into grinding, keeping a clean and sorted inventory (selling the bad stuff) .... this 'game' provides plenty of that - with bad camera, clumsy controls and odd hit/collision-detection.  PS: Did I mention the camera?!",

            "review_text": "This game gets boring after a while. There's a few hillarious bugs in the game that made me laugh my head off, but that's basically the best part. There are some very challenging and fun dungeons, but most of them are easy as heck, even though they shouldn't be. Why? Crossbows. You basically just need a crossbow and some decent juking strats and kiting strats if things get out of hand, because crossbows can stun enemies. They're basically unbalanced. Also, Fighting the Dragon is kinda boring. It has 4 basic moves that you can all dodge easily except for one of them, and 2 op abilities that can half shot you at level 15ish that you can dodge easily. There's also a bug that you can get while fighting the dragon, maybe in dungeons too. If you stand still and just use basic attacks, the dragon will keep attacking you until you get down to 1 hp. Then, for some reason, the game shows the dragon doing damage, but it actually doesn't and you become virtually immortal unless you use a heavy attack, special move, or you do a dodge roll. It's fun for the first 15 hours, then it gets boring.",

            "review_text": "Note: Reason to why I have so few hours into the game will be answered also in the review.   Firstly the game goes the easy ( read: lazy ) route of block-graphics ( Minecraft-inspired ). If you hate it then I think this game is not for you. I personally don't like it, but can handle it if the game is good.  This seems like a nice concept: Hack-n-Slash game with community content and custom dungeons and LOOTING!!!! So what we look for in this game is how fun it is to LOOT, how fun the classes and their development is and how good the combat feels. Let's see how it fares. In those 3 aspects.  Looting in this game seemed quite decent. I mean you get frequent chests, you get monster drops and 'higher-value' chests and also something like a 'boss'-drops. The system where you can 'donate' junk and gold to shrine to 'pray' for random good items for various slots is also a nice gamble and adds to all of the Gearing up aspect of an Hack-n-Slash.  The combat is where the game falls flat and by a huge margin. By no means is combat any fun. The hit detection is abysmal. I feel this game has worse or more difficult combat than Dark Souls for PC and that game aims to be difficult and challenging. Half the time you will be missing the enemy because you're not facing them, that's okay... half of the time when you are facing the enemy you still won't hit it, because your cursor is slightly off! Now even with everything angled right the hit-boxes are drunk and sway around the actual model.   The classes... You have 4 classes ( 2 mages, a warrior and a semi-warrior )... All of whom mostly swing their prefered weapon, at least at the early levels. Now I want you to pick ANY 4 heroes/champions/classes from an MOBA game and imagine having a GRINDING RPG game built around them... you have 4 abilities that hardly ever improve or feel different for all of the gear grinding and loot farming. I said 4? Yes that is if you play with each and seperate one, but mostly you'll be stuck with ONE.  I might have a bit biased oppinion, but that's what this god-awful combat system got me to. I have few reviews and generally prefer to write pleasant and good ones about games I like, but for me to write a negative one, the game seriously must SUCK.   I understand that the game is popular amongst some of you people, but so is Minecraft... and hell if I knew why..  ",

The player model looks like a cheesy cross between a Mii and a Lego guy. Ultimately, there is nothing to draw you in and I found very little reason to keep playing. Trust me when I say that the reviews here on Steam make it sound much more fun than it is. I'd recommend passing for now unless you're in it for the level editing or something.",

I bought the 4-pack for me and my friends for about 8 USD, and found the fighting aspect of it was pretty terrible. I have not tried the building aspect of it and may try to just to see what it is like but the battle mechanics are just too easy. The controls are mediocre and it just feels like you're playing a game for children. I will say there are a few things that I can give for it is the art style of the environment. It looks really nice and the textures for the levels made by people look finished and nice. But the character models seem a bit stolen from Roblox. Lastly, if you have a friend or more playing with you the game will be so increasingly easy that you will not die.",

            "review_text": "I am posting this 'review' after investing almost 8 hours of gameplay over two weeks. I don't think that's enough time to call this a propper review, so let's call it a first impressions. If I make it past 16 hours within the next two weeks, I'll review my review and fix anything I may have gotten wrong.  This is a game that feels like it should be in early access instead of full release. I do hope that it improves, but I cannot reccomend this game in its current state.  But before I put in a wall of text about how it sucks, first I'll go over what this game does right:  1) Map Editor. Any game with an in-buillt map editor gets brownie points from me, I love creating custom content (even though I suck at it). This editor is clunky and un-intuitive (you can tell it was designed with controllers in mind), but it exists so I'm happy.  2) Community created content. You mean there's constantly new stuff and I don't have to wait on the devs to make it? sweet.  3) It's pretty. The aesthetic is simplistic, but nice. The cartoonish feel works well with high-res textures on low-poly models.  4) It hasn't crashed yet, nor have I experienced any noticable frame-drops (running a AMD FX-4170 / GTX550ti if that helps anyone).  That's about it. Now to complaining!  1) Controls are extremely clunky. The delay between pressing the attack buttons, performing the animation, and being able to do something else (such as move) is waaaaaaaaay too long and has resulted in many bulshit deahts. I can tell that the issue is a lack of animation cancelling (look at Diablo3, which this game claims to partially inspiried by, it feels great because everything responds immediatly).  2) You can't change attack directions between strikes. This could just be part of 1, but it's aggrivating enough to warrent it's own spot)  3) Hitboxes don't match up with attack animations. Need I say more?  4) The auto-targetting system frequently can't find on-screen targets. Prime example is The Dragon, which makes wands (hitscan projectile weapon) completely useless because it relies entirely on the auto-targetting system to automaticcly hit things then the attack button is pressed. Speaking of auto-targetting, you can't aim things yourself, it just goes in the direction you're facing (unless the auto-target finds something, which as I said is unreliable).  5) This might just be a problem with inexperienced map makers, but several of the levels can be 'broken' by getting on top of the outside wall (which I'm certain you're not supposed to be able to do) to find the exit in seconds in a level that should take half an hour.  6) Lack of variety in class builds. So I a basic attack that varies on weapon, a secondary attack that varies whether that weapon is one handed or two handed, and four class abilities that never change (you just unlock them as you progress). Come on. Diablo 2 had 30 class skills PER CLASS (granted several were passives), and it came out in what year? I know comparing an indie dev to blizzard isn't fair, but they brought it upon themselves when the description said it's like diablo meets little big planet. That set some high expectations.   I'm still playing it though so I guess it's fun.",

As you cannot fight the dragon with anyone else.  Pros: Loot system, easy combat system, plenty of adventures, there's a dragon you can chip away at for awhile  Cons: The too easy combat system, TOO many crappy/unbalanced (especially some of the 'easy') adventures, you can't take anyone with you to fight the dragon. Gold has no use at all other than donating (so why even bother having in the game? Not very meaningful gameplay there)    I really think that if they just had some other use for the gold, and allowed coop for the dragon, and cleaned up the combat system, this would be an easy 90%+/Gold game if everything had some meaning. Otherwise, me and my four year old enjoy running around pointlessly and killing things together...  Good luck on Pacman, hope that you learn from your mistakes on this one. ",

            "review_text": "I played Fight the Dragon last night with a friend, and I don't really have any desire to play it again. I love dungeon crawlers (huge fan of the Diablos and Torchlights). I found this game to be quite glitchy (random locking of items, spell/ability book on the side of the house not available, not being able to switch inputs even after re-loading the game), and so did my friend. We didn't play the campaign, we just went for reward runs, and while most of the levels were great in concept, the designs in terms of gameplay were at times frustrating (like being able to get to a water area past a cliff but no way to get back, or killing a boss that opens a door on a timer, not making it in time, and the only option was to quit the level rather than try again). I got the humour of things like the item names and the NPC dialogues, but I found that it grew tiresome after a few hours. Maybe if there wasn't the frustration of the glitches, that might not have been the case.  I really like the concept, and I certainly see why it was supported. But in actual gameplay, it just didn't speak to me personally. Based on the reviews, it obviously spoke to others, though. :-)",
