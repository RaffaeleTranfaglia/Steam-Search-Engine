Lots of fun to be had with a few friends fighting over the bridge or playing together against waves of stupid AI. The AI will blunder often, but it's got a fair amount of content, a reasonable campaign even when played alone, and smooth enough controls to be a perfectly reasonable middle ground between two vastly different genres of shooter.

            "review_text": "Underrated game in my mind. I played this originally on the Xbox 360 back when it released, then later on purchased it on PC within a Codemasters Bundle that was on sale.  A lot of people like to say negative things about this game, but honestly, I really enjoyed it. I thoroughly enjoy realistic tactical shooters and milsims, and this game ranks high on the list of available games. That's not to say it doesn't have its problems. The AI isn't the best (although there is a mod to remedy this), and the resolutions are restricted to 1280x1024 as the highest option. To fix this, you'll need to download another .exe and replace the one in the game installation folder. The guides section has this fix explained in detail with links to the file.  The game has a great campaign, and in fact, it's easily one of the best single-player campaigns I've experienced; very enjoyable and expansive missions that feel very immersive and challenging in a very unforgiving manner. Screw up just a tiny bit, and it'll cost you greatly. There's a few side missions available independently from the campaign, plus you can download a ton of mission packs off of modding websites to further enhance the single-player longevity.  Multiplayer is no longer officially supported, which is unfortunate, however, there is a very simple workaround. Simply use Gameranger and host LAN games and you'll be completely set.   Now onto my gripes. These two issues are single handedly my biggest problems with this game, and if they weren't there, this would easily be one of the top military tactical shooters out there, and would be something I'd put a LOT more time into. These issues are FOV (Field of View) and mouse acceleration. Absolutely unforgivable to not have proper support in these areas. The FOV is locked at around 60, which is horrid. There's no way to change it, at all, by any means. Now, I did get used to it, and didn't let it ruin my experience too much, and I'll get to that in a second.   As for mouse acceleration, once again, no fix available. You're stuck with it, and it sucks. In this regard, playing with a controller is actually superior, although your aim will undoubtedly suffer from it.   Now if it was one or the other, it wouldn't be that much of a problem. For example, if you could increase your FOV to around 90, but the mouse acceleration was still present, it would still be annoying, but it would be  less  annoying. If there was no mouse acceleration, but the FOV was still locked at 60, once again, less annoying. But the two combined.... just, it's terrible, and as I said, unforgivable in a PC game.   Aside from that, this is easily one of the most optimized games I've ever played. The performance is outstanding, especially on any PC stronger than an Xbox 360. I mean think about it, last gen consoles could run this game. Naturally people would compare this game to Arma, and in the realm of performance, there's no comparison. The EGO Engine is outstanding, and the visuals still hold up well even today.   In fact, I'd compare the visuals to the newly released SQUAD, and in some ways, it even looks better. To be completely honest, after playing this game through again just recently, I'd say it's  very  similar to SQUAD in gameplay style, and even the HUD elements (compass, weapon selection menu, etc.), only it has a very detailed single-player experience.  To rap things up, it's an excellent game, hampered down by two glaring issues that can be mitigated if you play this game the way it was designed... as a console game. What I mean by this, plug in your Xbox 360 controller, sit back farther than usual, and the FOV will be somewhat more tolerable, and mouse acceleration will be a non-issue since you're not even using a mouse.   If you can get past those two issues, you're in for a great military shooter experience. Calling in artillery and mortor fire is easily one of the most satisfying things you can do in this game, among many other things.   So with that in mind, given its price, I'd recommend it. Plus with Steams ability to refund, you'll be able to experience enough within 2 hours to determine whether or not you'll want to issue one.",

            "review_text": "This is a tough one. The original Operation Flashpoint GOTY game was one of the greatest 'realistic', tactical, sans-health bar FPS games of all time, with two fantastic expansions which both added huge amounts of content to the game (in much the same way Morrowind was improved by Tribunal and Bloodmoon) and a wonderful gameplay style that gave the game tremendous replayability and gave the player tremendous scope to imagine the world around them.  Of course, after that original title the companies that were responsible for the game split up - Bohemia Interactive making the ARMA series (eternally disapointing in kind of the same way Gothic was: just not refined, polished, bug-free or fun enough to match the technological ambition) and Codemasters making this game.  Dragon Rising was many years in the making, and while you can say that in certain ways it was a better shooter than the ARMA titles, you can say that it was nevertheless dissapointing and an inferior title to the original OpFlash in terms of how it contrasted with the titles already available.  If we are to compare this game with ARMA then you might say that the game is a bit more stable, the missions a bit more cinematic and well paced, the guns a bit more realistic and satisfying to use. These advantages are real and enjoyable, but none of them represent industry leading iterations of the features - the original OpFlash lead the industry in map size, replayability, freedom, difficulty (if you so desired) and scope, but Dragon Rising doesn't really set the world alight in any one way.  This does have to do with the bugs that, while not as annoying as in ARMA 2, for example, are still present. I once played a mission where a tank somehow got stuck to my soldier by an invisible, 10 meter pole. no kidding, I walked around the map with a many tonne tank spinning wildly ten meters above my head, smacking and clattering into the ground incessantly whenever I tried to get in a vehicle but, somewhat disapointingly, refusing to crush the squad mates that I tired to hard to splatter. Another time I had to give up on an entire playthrough as a certain mission bugged and was simply impossible to complete.  The zones are still big, the soliders still responsive to orders, the enemies still reasonably deadly, but the island of Skira fails to burst into life in the same way the original OpFlash island of Everon did, largely because the game is let down by instability and unconvincing scenarios. It is a huge shame that this game failed, and while some admirable advertising almost convinced me to give Red River a go it was apparently even worse than DR, and as such sadly I fear we must lay this game to rest.  I am reminded of the classic xBox shooter BLACK. Quite forgotten now, it had a really polished feel and really immersive, solid missions. It is perhaps where the ingredients that would have made Dragon Rising a really good game snuck off to.  I still recommend this game, because it is better than ARMA 2 for as long as it lasts before it bugs out, and it just has a better title, let's face it.",

            "review_text": "OFDR is an attempt by Codemaster to reviveits Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis, originally developed by Bohemia Interactive (who created their own 'Arma' franchise). Using their own 'EGO' engine, OFDR is an attempt to bring back the 'sandbox military shooter' genre, in trying to get away from the tightly scripted experience of MOH or COD franchise. The result is a bit hit and miss, due to unforgiving difficulty, a tightly scripted experience on an open map, and clunky interface that was not even optimized for gamepad.   Set on a fictional island just off Russia, which has the potential of large oil reserves, China, with some historical claims, chose to invade it for the oil to fulfill its own energy needs. Russia, busy with its problems, requested US for help, and US marines landed, and soo ncame into direct conflict with the People's Liberation Army. You will get to play two characters... a Marine Sgt with his own fireteam, and a special forces lieutenant leading his own fireteam. They have different missions on different part of the island, but together they will find a way to kick the PLA off the island.   The game is realistic in that you can be wounded by a single bullet, and a head shot will likely kill you. You will need to use the medpack on yourself to staunch the bleeding (else you'll fade out and die), and/or summon the fireteam medic (or anyone else) to bandage you. However, the interface to do so is clumsy and impossible to use during combat. Same with grenades. You have them, but throwing them is a real PITA.   The game does retail a lot of the open feel. If you can get at a vehicle, you can probably drive it. A jeep, sure. Tank or APC? No problem. Helicopter? Why not, if you catch one on the ground. Killing armor, on the other hand, is a different problem, as clearly they are invulnerable to your bullets, and you have to find anti-armor weapons (Queen Bee AT rocket, Javelin AT missile, etc.) . And you will occasionally get to shoot Stinger or Strela SAM at helicopters.   The actual shooting, however, leaves much to be desired. You will barely spot the enemy at all, even through the various target scopes, unless you happen across a sniper rifle (usually by killing an enemy sniper, or special ammo crates). There's also plenty of foliage and terrain features. Add it to a very... bland color pallete (it's almost all autumn yellow) and you'll NEVER spot the enemies without a little help from the threat indicator (which is only active at the 'easy' difficulty level). And no, there's no 'radar' showing you where the enemies are. This is a sim, not a 'game'.   The missions are long and the progress saved at checkpoints. However, the checkpoints are not always placed at logical spots, and you often don't know what exactly you did wrong last playthrough. So you end up repeating the checkpoint over and over until you throw your controller through the monitor. The missions also fail to allow the open-sandbox style map to work its magic, as most of the missions are tightly scripted and often with a TIME LIMIT, such as 'you must eliminate the SAM teams before our own gunships arrive in X minutes'. Obviously there's going to be a ton of enemies between you and the SAM teams, all wanting to shoot you dead.   All in all, OFDR is extremely disappointing. It has plenty of potential, as its sequel, OF:Red River showed. However, the execution is marred by timed mission triggers, impossibility of acquiring targets in the scopes, and very clunky interface, even on a gamepad.",

Graphics are pretty good, controls can be confusing at first if you often play games with simple controls, but it adds to the realism. Maps are huge. Vehicle gameplay is pretty good I guess, I like how you can actually turn on and off the lights and engine. You can call of artillery and shout orders to your team like a maniac through radial menus. That's nice. You can carry two primary weapons, one secondary, lots of other equipment, and also loot the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s you kill. Buildings are destructible. Missions are your typical war game missions, what would you expect? Eliminate ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, blow up radars and things that pose a threat to friendly vehicles, secure a place and hold it, etc. Occasional stealth, too. There's not much weapon variety, but most of them have several variants with different attachements. I guess that's something that makes up for it.  Story is pretty average, but I'm OK with that.  AI is stupid, as with any game. Sometimes radio lines are not heard (but show in the subtitles). Sprint speed is pretty pointless as there's barely any difference from the normal speed. Sometimes enemies take about 15 rounds (half a mag for most weapons) to take out, even at point blank. This seems to be random, as sometimes I kill enemies with a single shot on the foot. That, or I'm missing something here.  In short, not the best there is, but not that bad. It's interesting. If you like war games that are a bit more realistic than usual, you should give it a shot. Take into account that this is not a war simulator.",

Confusing commands as compared to it's predecesor; too complex but more accurate. Nice menu and themes but needs more features for a port.  Long live Red River, screw Codemasters.",

The games graphics are decent but gameplay is somewhat lacking as when you start enemies see you from miles away opening fire at you and suddenly your on the ground with no idea of what is happening bleeding to death. Your comrades have no self decision ability so when your under attack against a swarm of enemies you have to manually command them to take cover. Worst of all the controls are horrible and difficult for normal fps gamers to get used to making a clunky and annoying gameplay experience.   4.5/10",

Some of the missions don't have checkpoints at all and forces you to sit through few minute cutscenes.   AI is terrible. Your own squad stands stupidly and gets killed really fast. Enemy AI has an aimbot which allows about 150ms reaction time after coming around a corner. Enemy AI surprised from close range can and will kill two players in less than a second.  Another annoyance is the 'MOVE HERE TO PROGRESS' indicators. Game does not allow you to come up with your own tactics.  Recommended for co-op? Maybe. (Co-op is possible, does not require LAN even though server is started from same LAN menu.)  Recommended for single player? No.",

It has a giant glaring issue. NO FOV OPTIONS!!! THE GAME PLAYS AT 65 DEGREES OF VERTICAL VISION WITH NO WAY OF INCREASING IT!!!  This is a huge issue for many PC gamers as such a low Feild Of View causes a lot of us nausia, headaches, motion sickness and other similar issues like eye strain. I can't enjoy a game when it's painful to play and after extensive searching I still can't find a fix. If someone knows how to fix this problem please let me know but until I can comfortably sit at my desk and play I will negatively review it.  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!  If it had proper FOV options or at the very least something that wasn't so plainly insulting like 90 or 100 then I would review this game 8/10 and worth a try, but in the absence of such essential features it's hardly worth your time.",
