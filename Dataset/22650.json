            "review_text": "Second game in the Alien Breed trilogy. The graphics are still sharp giving you great environments, though the environments lack variety. The action is well paced with some sporatic intense action sequences. The lack of ammunition in the levels keeps the strategy of what weapons to use for different situations interesting. I found it a bit irritating to keep backtracking over and over again on the same levels, however, this does give you a sense of a huge level since the levels can take quite some time to beat. Great fun at a great price. Online multiplayer, while dead, is available for those that have friends that may want to play this with them.",

            "review_text": "Alien Breed is an isometric sci-fi shooter where you independently control the direction your character aims and moves. You maneuver through a series of 5 stages in each episode, collecting weapons and items, and shooting aliens as they appear while you move from objective to objective provided on your mini-map.  It is difficult to write a separate review for each Episode, as they all largely play the same - you move from point A to point B to pick up access code C to open door D to get to point E to get access code F to.....you get the picture. Lots of backtracking through same-looking corridors, fighting similar looking enemies which pop out of the floor and walls.  It's fun, but only moderately so - I would NOT recommend playing through a single episode in one sitting, let alone all three episodes. The gameplay is repetitive and it's the sort of thing you'll want to put down for a while between sessions (I'd actually say on the level of months between episodes) so it doesn't get stale.",

            "review_text": "In my opinion the best part of the trilogy. The first part got me bored after a little while, but turned out to be a good opener for this one.   You got some serious action and maybe some times even a little bit of tactics in there. Most of the time you spend gun-running aliens, while pressing buttons of red screens which just turn green once you get close.   So bird-eye view is something I had to get used to for a moment in part 1 and in this there are some parts where you switch to third person cam suddenly.   The best part is still the storyline, with your cyborg friend and the great evil guy. Really makes you want to get part 3.  All in all a little recurring after the first 150 aliens and they could made just one game, instead of three. But still interesting and some times challenging.",

I did get this off the Steam Summer camp sale prize booth so its good as a free game. Alien Breed 2 may look like a cross between Dead Space and Valve's new Alien Swarm. It does hold a creepy environment like Dead Space and watered down gameplay of Alien Swarm. I didn't find this game too fun at all because the campaign was lousy and boring. 5 long boring levels with no memorable moments. It seems Team 17, the makers of this game are trying to hold the same type of Run and gun gameplay of the original Alien Breed. Doesn't work today. The worst thing I saw the bad voice acting. Which made it less fun to play. Co OP feature has little or no community at all since anyone hardly plays this game. I don't think anyone plays the other 2 alien breeds either. So when I did play the co op with a friend. I didn't find it fun at all. It lacks weapons and fun. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.",

            "review_text": "NEGATIVE REVIEW, not recommending.  I can safely say that this review will match my review of the first game word for word. Around 8 hours of tedious, repetitive gameplay. I read many reviews about how all three Alien Breed games are basically the same game, and upon completing the second game, I have to admit, they're right about what they said.   This game has no real improvement over the first one, with the exception of a few small things. The plot is not very memorable, as per the first game. All I remember is that we're fixing YET ANOTHER ship, and there were some areas of it that I could recognize distinctly being in the first game--they're reusing maps. It exposes way too much of the environment with this tactic.  It's always 'go to this objective, kill aliens, fix it, kill aliens, go back to where you first started off, kill more aliens, rinse and repeat'. They tried to revive the classic Alien Breed, but this developer isn't doing so well nowadays. If you're a fan of monotonous works, it's for you. Otherwise, steer clear of it.   The two things that I found nice that they did change was the boss and the actual real antagonist. There is a more interesting boss battle halfway into the game; however, the way they go about it made it seem petty the third time you had to kill the SAME BOSS that just got crushed within a train. It's just not logical. But the fight was more interesting.  And then the antagonist. In the first Alien Breed game, there didn't feel like there was any main antagonist to fight; the only thing you could call your enemy was the aliens that were constantly attacking you. Near the end of the game, they FINALLY decided to bring up a being that you could call your antagonist of the story. I love whoever voice acted him--it's very pleasant to hear in a world of monotonous voices that you'll never be able to recall. However, the comics between chapters aren't telling me enough about this character, and I'm wondering why this antagonist is even trying to stop Conrad from destroying the ship. There's too many plot holes to be able to fully enjoy this mysterious antagonist.   Also, the ending was complete bull. It was disappointing and did NOT leave me wanting to know more, because of how dull and anti-climactic it was in the end.   I'll be honest, I did TRY to enjoy it, thinking that it was just my preference of games that made this so unappealing to me to play, but after reading tens of reviews about the lackluster gameplay, I feel that I can stand by my review.",

But the camera still rotates by 45Â° increments, and since the aiming is relative to your orientation, each time you rotate the camera, your aiming rotates ; and not in a discrete way. This completely ruins the potential flow of the game.",

Cons -First boss battle and where I quit the screen is shaking and dang near constantly shaking in a way that actually made me feel disoriented in real life. Which is a rarity for the amount I play vidya games and speaks to the bad design. -To much of the game is opening doors or holding a button to activate something to walk to the next area that looks alot like that last. -Character can be pointing at and missing aliens and his aim snapping to the aliens isn't quite what you would want  -Dark, gritty and brown graphics. Brooowwwwnnn. Like a turd. -No one owns it to play coop with they probably wouldn't want to though -Feels more like a Coop/online intended game than a single player experience. Like Borderlands. Feels somewhat empty without other players.  Pros +It looks good for an UE3 game and the devs did some work trying to hide that cheap UE3 look but didn't succeed completely +Sound design can be quite good and pleasant to the ears +Cooperative play over network is always a good addition if you can find someone  After typing all this up I still feel a little weird and disoriented from that beginning of the boss battle.
