    "description": "When you crave for adventure, but you live in a post-apocalyptic desert. When you dream of love, but you hang out with just your goofy little sister. When you want to be a hero, but everyone thinks of you as of some fragile baby. Then the only thing that can help you to survive is faith in yourself.",
