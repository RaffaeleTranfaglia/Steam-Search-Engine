            "review_text": "While by no means a Future Racing pro, I at least hold my own in the majority of Future Racers, good or bad. Quantum Rush Champions, at first, seemed promising, a spiritual successor to Wipeout, on the PC, with some cool ideas. But the game does not want me to like it. It actively resists such attempts.  A heavy chicane series in the third track. Until engines and boosters are upgraded, races are a tedious slog to, at best, a silver. Weapon pickups have a hitbox a third the size of the boost pads, and the same goes for the packages of Courier mode. Weapons, for the most part, rely on either perfect straights, or getting close to other racers (Which is somewhat difficult when said racers have upgrades you do not. Like engines and boosters.) What is worse still, my upgrades in one tier count for... Nothing beyond being able to beat *that* Tier, of *that* campaign, with *that* craft. And Time Trial times require not only those upgrades, but a flawless line.  I want to like Quantum Rush Champions. But it doesn't let me. Needing multiple attempts and specific unlocks to achieve even a silver medal is not fun. Needing to do it every racing class is not fun. In short, though I had high hopes for this game since Quantum Rush Online... This game has too high a difficulty curve, with too much grind, for it to be fun. Which is a shame.",

            "review_text": "Always a sense of movement and   SOMETHING   happening. I recommend you have a keyboard or GC controller, as it is very much a 'Balls to the walls' racing game. It's a mix between the high speed action of F-Zero and the randomness and questionability of Mario Kart.  The game is good and music is great, I play on minimum settings (GEForce 430) and get a good framerate (rarely drops below 75), but the game still looks good, and definitely plays well with a keyboard. I recommend that if you've played F-Zero (or even if you haven't but find it interesting) that you try this game. I picked it up in beta for $4 and even now, at $10, it is worth every cent I reckon.

            "review_text": "tl;dr unplayable with bad controls and just bad design all around. Not worth it even if F2P. 0/10.  I tried this game again after an extended absence. I do this thing where I stop playing a bad game in hopes that it will get improved by the devs and/or that my opinion (if it's holding me back) will change. On this latest playthrough, neither of those have changed.  Relevant to my gameplay: I used the 360 controller only (didn't attempt keyboard, don't think it would be any better).  Ultimately I can't write a full review on this because I can't get past the first race. And it's not a problem of skill, though I am not very good at this game. The problem lies with the laggy controls, confusing powerups that do almost nothing, the extreme slowdown when hitting obstacles (or being completely stopped), and the AI players that never hit a side wall or get shot by you (unless you are extrememly lucky).   So this current playthrough, I attempted the same 1st race 7 times and my best place was 8th. It falls back on the flawless AI and the maps which aren't designed for travel, they're designed to slow you down and stop you. That's not racing. In fact that's not even gameplay, Especially when you add in that the controls almost always over compensate and only do so after a lag on the input so you don't turn at all when you hit the turn, then you hit the wall, then the overcompensation comes in and you hit the other wall immediately after. So in order to turn, you have to try to turn well before you even get to the turn, then magically stop turning and use the bank breaks to slow yourself down from hitting the inside wall. What?   Anyways, this game is going in my crap section since it is virtually unplayable and nothing else about the game has any appeal. It comes down to:  *so-so graphics and music *bad racetrack design *flawless AI *unforgiving obstacles *and terrible controls.   I admit, I am not good at this game. But from a basic game creation standpoint, the first map should be relatively simple and a tutorial to ease people into the gameplay and controls. This game literally fails at the onset. In fact, even the menu screen is a fail because it's unintuative (other then pressing A or B a bunch of times) and the devs didn't even bother to map the D-pad to navigate the menus. 'Full Controller Support,' HA!   At least I got it on sale and got to sell my steam cards. 0/10",

            "review_text": "If you've ever been envious of the consoles with their fancy AG racing games, well, now you don't have to be. Quantum Rush has some rough spots, but delivers a great AG racing game. Taking heavy inspiration and even improving elements of WipEout, it's a pretty fun racing game, with a great visual look. It's a little like Jax X Combat Racing in that you have a primary weapon and can get pickups on the track, but its AG racing, and best of all, the engine explosions actually are well done. It's also deeper than other racing games, as you have to manage heat and energy and armor, but it never feels overwhelming. $10 isn't a terrible price for this game, and if you see it on sale, definitely go for it.   As for cons, like I said, there are some rough spots. Controller support is fine during races, but bad in the menu. Also, many things aren't explained to you directly, which really should be. Also, the AI is pretty hard, and there's no difficulty settings that I could find, but all of these don't really take too much away from the game.  EDIT: There is actually a manual for this game that explains a lot of the things that I thought should have been explained, however, there is very little indication that there is a manual, and I only thought to check on a hunch.",

I love the customization system, racing system itself and visuals (which are pretty fancy!). But....... that's all.  Which really bugs me is that developers deny every request and idea users have  It could be a good f-zero/star wars racer offspring but they fuced it up p bad leaving a lot of annoying quirks. Most of the players will ditch that game after few races, because it's really hard to enjoy a game in where AI has a huge advantage over you. Sure, it may be rewarding when you manage to finish 1st, but I guess not everyone's up for that kind of challenge. Especially if more than a half of community complains about ♥♥♥♥ed up AI difficulty level  tl;dr a really not well polished game, developers dont want to do anything about it",
