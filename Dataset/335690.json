Recently I play a lot of otome games, and this does not differ from other titles (except Cheritz games which are the best I've played so far). If you like otomes should play this game too :)  For better recommendation for game read post from CallistaWhite - after reading this recommendation I bought this game and I do not regret.  thx CallistaWhite :)",

            "review_text": "It's way too repetitive. Obviously I am not saying that about the gameplay, lol. More so in the actual dialog. The only changes are within the events of the story progression. Otherwise everything else is exactly the same. To me it's a major buzz kill. Which makes going through the game a second time even harder... considering how short the game is in general. The story is a bit different than your average visual novel, but in the end you're still forcing yourself through the same content just to see progression. I say no to this game, but if you still want to try it then I suggest not playing in long sessions, because it becomes tiring really fast.",
