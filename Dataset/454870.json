You max your towers before getting halfway through the game.  2. In the mobile game you have to buy all characters except for your first. Here you unlock them as you go through the maps. 3. When I try to move my character to a certain spot, sometimes he will run another direction trying to get there and never make it. 4. When you upgrade a stat on your characters it does not show that you gained in that stat.   Only about just over halfway through the map, but that is what I see at the moment.",
