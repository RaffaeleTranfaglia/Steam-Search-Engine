            "review_text": "Don't be fooled by its appealing graphics; under the polished visuals lies a frustrating, slow and clunky physics-based platformer which unfortunately doesn't become much more interesting as the game progresses.  The general summarized gameplay, 'get these things to the end of the level', is accomplished much better by other physics-based games like World of Goo or Mercury. Get those instead, and save yourself a headache.",

'Impulsive' is a word most of us will recognize here. Myself included. Before playing I had no idea what this game was all about. 'Why ?', I keep asking myself. Because this game is great fun.  Essentially Puddle is a platformer game where instead of a character you control multiple fluids (sticky, explosive, you name it). You know the drill; getting from point A to B. But there are switches to be flipped, fluids to be split and more, and you have to tactically move your fluid because if the fluid get below a certain amount it's game over. Some of the later levels can be truly frustrating, but at the same time fun and, in a way, relaxing.  It looks great in motion, I truly adore the artwork. It's simple, yet sophisticated and colorful. Just check out the screenshots and you know what I mean. The sound effects get the job done, in a realistic way. It's what you'd expect.  To all my fellow impulse-buyers; please do check out this game. You won't regret it, I'm pretty sure (that's right; not 100% :P).  [Rating: 78/100]",

The slow pace and infurating lack of percision &amp; control will make you dread every moment of this game, which is a stretch to call it that. It's more like a liquid tilting simulator. If that's your thing than you'll enjoy 'Puddle', if not? Might be best to pass on it.",

            "review_text": "Puddle is this kind of game I wish I could recommend.  It's a physics based puzzle game with a great concept, it's creative and honestly, I did have some fun while playing it. But there are flaws that can't make me recommend it (or at least to its full price).  The point is basically to make some liquid go from point A to point B, while being confronted in different situations and environments.  Depending of the level, the liquids are different, with their unique properties, which makes them interact differently with their environment... although I thought that most times, whether they were different or not, the same physics applies to them.  While the game has a great concept and there's a certain variety of levels for the player's entertainment, the game gets hard very quickly, and it becomes quite irritating to fail again and again a level.   You can never know what's ahead, as the camera is too close to your liquid. It also seems to follow the liquid part that's in the front, and never gives you a big picture, which is pretty annoying if you have most of liquid left behind. Also, the physics and at times, whole level design, are really clunky, which is of course a real problem for a game as such, where you need to be really precise with where you take your puddle.  About the great difficulty, and I’ll be frank, what immediately irritated me when I started the game: the “casual” or easy mode, is called a mode for “whiners”, where you’re allowed to skip a limited amount of levels and you won’t appear in the leader boards.  To me, calling the casual mode as a mode for 'whiners', where you 'whine' when skipping a level, is an insult to all gamers, casual or not. It's aiming at all the ones just wanting to enjoy their games without pressure, nor wanting to have their names in some leader board unlike the normal mode (which, curiously, they haven’t renamed…).   In short: Great concept, very interesting ideas but quite clunky physics which is a great problem when you need to be precise. The game gets difficult too quick for casual gamers, or as they put it, “whiners”.",

While playing the story you play different liquids like water ofc, hydrocarbon, nitroglycerin and more funny and disgusting stuff. The levels artwork is awesome like the X-Ray photograph levels where you are inside a humans body or painted levels with almost the style of 'Doodle Jump'.  Some levels are not easy even if you already know what to do. Has a Normal Mode and a Hardcore Mode, in Normal you can often skip levels, in Hardcore you don't have that much skips and you can earn gold medals.  For arround 10€ it's worth to buy. 8/10",

A lot of the levels seem to be designed poorly, to the point that even when playing on Normal, the 'difficulty so easy that even (the creator's) grandma can get a gold medal on every level', I have a hard time making it through some of the -beginning- levels.  You're even given 'whiner' tokens to help you get past the levels that are either broken/buggy or not even worth playing.
