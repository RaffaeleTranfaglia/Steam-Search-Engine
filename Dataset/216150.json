            "review_text": "For claification sake, I've played this game since Beta and I love the overall animation and playstyle imaged as a 2D platformer. I guess this really hit a nostalgia nerve for me and my yearning for the old Mario Brothers mechanics. And while I hate to bash something I fell in love with, this is no longer the game that I use to know.  Back in the early days of MapleStory, you had your 4 standard classes: Mage, Warrior, Archer, Thief. Mage and Warrior had 3 subsets each; Archer and Thief had 2 subsets. Finding equipment and hanging out with friends was easy because there was just a few servers and not that many maps. The level cap was set as a crazy 200, but the mindless grinding wasn't so bad, cause you could easily be with your friends and if you found an equip you couldn't use, one of them could and vice versa.  But Maplestory grew. On the surface, you would think this is a good thing; more people = more friends = more equips. True, but Nexon saw this as an excellent opportunity to milk its players through microtransactions.   As the game grew, Nexon built more servers and maps, creating virtual spacial rifts between players. It became more and more difficult to get to the same map as a friend without using a teleport rock (a microtransaction item) or wasting a bunch of time. Nexon created pets, vanity items, world transfers, shops; all for real money. When that wasn't enough, they created more character types, those who couldn't share the cash shop items with the original characters, essentially urging players to rebuy cash items. The new characters also lead to the nerfing of some of the original characters under the guise of 'improved' for rebalancing issues. Nexon raised the level cap to 250, milking players for even longer. They created a lottery system called gachapon for in-game items using real money, not to mention special event 'lotteries'.  Don't play Maplestory. It's not what it use to be. The fun is sucked out of it. Don't waste tons of time and money on it like I did.",

            "review_text": "I remember waking up as a kid, excited and eager to start up my dad's computer, hopping into the world of Maplestory, ready to take on whatever the game was going to throw at me that day. Needless to say, I was hooked. The cartoony yet oddly satisfying visuals, the huge world that was set before me, the deceptively simple class system, all things that I adored about it. For a while, I couldn't get enough of this game. It was my first MMO ever, and, to this day, probably still my favorite. Nothing comes close to the fun I had while killing mushrooms in the starting zone, slaying Balrogs on airships, destroying robots in Ludi, and finally, conquering Zakum. I made many friends, joined a slew of guilds, and mostly, just had fun. That's what videogames were about back when I played Maplestory, and in a sense, it seems like they've kind of lost that recently, although that's a different topic entirely. Maplestory now seems to be much more oversaturated in terms of classes and things to do, actually making it an overwhemingly experience rather than an extremely enjoyable one, one that I had when I played. Needless to say however, I still had a HUGE amount of fun with this game, and is hands-down one of the best experiences, if not THE best, I've had in gaming. I cannot speak to the community now, but when I was playing, it was a bunch of generous and fun loving people, one's that were willing to help others when they needed it. I miss Maplestory, specifically old Maplestory, even more specifically v.066, when things were simpler and I had a bunch of NX to spend on a different hairstyle.   I miss you Maplestory.  Thanks for giving me the game of a lifetime.",

            "review_text": "I first played maplestory maybe 7 or 8 years ago and at first it was fun. (Note: my main interest is quests.)  I remembered it was a game that, if you are a casual player, got harder and harder to progress as you went on. Eventually I stopped playing because it would take far too long to level up and make any sort of meaningful progress. Plus items like scrolls to increase certain traits of a weapon were pricey and overall the game was just slow.  Fast forward to 2016 and I am back! It's a lot of fun now. Nexon have made certain parts of the game painless and have introduced new niche areas. Not interested in monsters or mapleworld? How about becoming a star/celebrity over at Star Planet? Want something different to the world of monsters and magic? Check out Friends Story, one of the alternative dimensions that's set in the modern world where you play a student!  If you just want to do quests and wander about - the game now has a very good guide that will recommend the quests that are right for your level. I followed this guide and levelled up quickly, giving me more options to explore other parts of the game and even take on a big boss or two.  Improving your weapons and equipment is now simple to do and doesn't take long at all.  My main criticism of the game is that it seems like a neverending mess. Little to no structure and if you were looking for a main storyline to follow there isn't really one. Instead there are lots of short story arcs, or series of quests (one leading on to the next), which is great while it lasts but leaves you thinking - now what?  Playing alone is fine, and I mainly solo, however playing with friends is a lot more fun.",

            "review_text": "TL;DR: PROS: levelling with quests and not just grinds, a lot of classes, findable good equips, great for new players (and old ones if they can get over the fact that the game isn't the same as it was 16 years ago) CONS: quiet community in-game, some party quests are completely dead  I see a lot of reviews talking about how much the game has changed and how there's no nostalgia left for us older players. As an older player myself (I've been playing Maple off and on since 2006), I disagree. What brought me back to Maple after the last four year haitus I had was the nostalgia, but what kept me playing was the complete rehaul of the game.  When I was a kid with dial-up internet, getting to the first job advancement was difficult. Fast forward to today: I have played almost every class through into the fourth advancement. Yes, it's been made a lot easier, but it's also reasonable now; any player can get a good diversity of content regardless of experience or skill. The endless 10-20 level grind on the same map is gone, now theme dungeons and quests offer the best leveling chance, which is loads more fun. In fact, quests used to be altogether useless, so this change is super awesome.  There's so many classes now! I was super happy when I came back to all the new classes. I actually can't wait for more to come out so I have more skills to try out. (I'm hoping there's an all-new class soon with new clothing equips and not just weapons.)  The addition of spell traces and the equip enhancement system actually reduces the pay-to-win aspect that has ALWAYS (as in FOREVER, as in THIS IS NOTHING NEW) been a part of Maple. It offers people the chance to have good equips but without the ridiculous cost and rarity of scrolls. Equipment drops have been completely rehauled and now have hidden potentials, allowing players to find their equips without having to spend mesos or real money and to make a decent bit of mesos that help in the later game with pots and the like. (Side note: I remember the days of the scrolled out sauna robe, can't nobody tell me the new equip drop system is bad.)  Us older players are not the major target of this game anymore and that's OKAY. It's for those kids coming in at the same age when we started back in the day. It's not entirely Maple and Nexon's fault that the previous audience left, a good deal of people left because they got older and found other games, particularly MOBAs. (Admittedly, the game community has gotten quieter and some party quests are dead, but, again, see previous point.)  All-in-all, it's not right to make a crappy review on the game because it's changed over the course of over a decade and a half. The game is different, even easier, and that's totally cool. I think it's a great choice for new, young gamers with its cute graphics and background music. And if older players approach it as a different game than the one they remember, it can be really great for them too.",

The game itself is very enjoyable, but the problem is that most of the playerbase is gone. I've played all the classes and gotten some characters to level 200+. Probably one of the best mmorpgs i've ever played. Most of the people you will meet are very friendly and will try to help you learn how to play. The game also has many events, most notably the anniversary events and seasonal events.  10/10 would recommend. The reboot update on 12/2 will make the game less pay2win and will probably bring back some players/bring new players into the game.",

I have put countless hours into this game and it will forever and always hold a speical place in my heart. That being said...  The Good This game is MASSIVE! By virtue of it being such a long standing MMO, it has more conntent then I could ever hope to see. Grinding (And ooohhhh yeah there's A LOT of that...) has some suprising little challenges that make it more tolorable. It has a unique artstyle and gameplay as compared to most MMO's. It has a lot of charm if you're willing to sit through the other stuff.  The Bad Um... There's a whole lot. The comunity seems to have fallen appart. I've heard of MMO's with toxic comunities. Maplestory's is non existant. There's a group of max level players that seem to... enjoy? them? Selves? (They sit in cities waiting for people to 'fame' them.) I Actively attempted to have social interactions with other individuals, and failed. Miserably. They're just... not there. Or they simply seem to not care. At all.  It's so borring to do anything after a while. I've been playing since I was ten, and it probably took me 25+ hours just getting one character to level 100 (Which is less than half-way to max level) and... it wasn't fun after the inital 20 or so. I did it just because it was like my childhood dream to have a character at the final job advancement. Also, balance is non-existant. Certain classes are just WAY more fun and WAY stronger than other classes. That's just part of the game. (I guess that's not nessisarily bad. It's just something to be aware of)  The Ugly It's... it's an old game. It shows. It feels like they keep trying to put more and more paint on it, and now it feels like it's just that... Paint. A facsimile of it's former self. Almost like someone has taken a dead relative and taxadermised they're corpse and prettends like they're still alive. (A bit of an extreme example, but acurate nonetheless.)  The end. I am done with this game, it's not fun for me anymore. If you decide to play it, maybe you'll find something I didn't and have more fun then I did. I sinceerly hope you do. But I honestly suggest you play a different game. or wait for Maplestory 2 to come out. I know I'll be giving it a shot, haha. (Seriously, it's a thing give it a look.)",

Not like world of warcraft grinding where the quests are all different. Maplestory is go to this place, kill X amount of these, and repeat for every quest in the game. Once you get to a high enough level boss fights are pretty fun but that's after grinding up to that level. Party quests are fun to do though. It makes the incessant grinding a lot more bearable.  The loot system is pretty basic where all the enemy's stuff gets thrown to the floor and you run over it button mashing to pick it all up. That gets kinda old after a while but luckily there's pets that pick up the loot for you! That you have to pay for... Gotta make money somehow I guess?  One of the charms Maplestory has is the platforming. There's a few quests where you parkour around to get to the next one. Those were always enjoyable (if infuriating at times) and a nice breather from the grinding.  Overall Maplestory is a pretty basic game. Kill this, get experience, level up to get new skills so you can keep grinding. It's more of a game you play if you have a summer with nothing really else to do. It's not the best game but it's not the worst either. The events were always really fun though and one of the reasons I keep revisiting this game. So yes, recommended if you have a lot of time to kill.",

Try it again after 3 months and then play it for a long time again... Repeat.  Being a person who has not spent a single penny on this game, I still probably found fun in this game. Possibly just because I like wasting my time because I have barely any games to play, and still at least have some satisfaction included.       I'll go with some pros with the game.     First is the graphic design... It has a unique appeal to it while giving itself a charm. Even the most evilest looking of all enemies look clean.   From the attacks, there is a lot of  'WHOA HOLY CRAP THIS LOOKS SO AWESOME!!!'  ones cosmetically, while at times practically.   Most of the notable characters in the present main story are pretty original. Cygnus, Neinhart, Orchid, and so on.   and As part of the story, the clans within it are quite official feeling, the Black Wings, the Cygnus Knights... The black wings especially due to the amount of backstory with their characters.        And now... the cons.     As most of the people know, yes, this is a  freemium  game by all means. Making the game's experience the more fun using actual funds. As for the same time, there were a lot of freemium items I found that only had a 90 day trial. It is like valve making a system where you pay $30 to have a certain unusual for a temporary amount of time, Except less attention instead.   The playerbase is 95% of people at the age of &gt;13, the first time I encountered someone who chat with me and requested to play together, I denied the request in the most polite way I could think of saying... All he said was '*********' after that, and that is the only time I actually talked to someone out of the hours I played with this game. Also the amount of times I've seen someone who wants to get married using the shout system.   Quests in a nutshell:  FIND ME 150 OF THIS AND THAT EACH AND I'LL GIVE YOU SOME EXP!!!!   Find me something that is almost impossible to do until you level up 50 more times. '  I need you to hunt the monsters till they drop something, the programmers made it very lucky to find.    and Classes are unbalanced that it felt like it was measured using kilometre rulers, and thought a 1Km difference didn't mind much. After playing the Evan class for a while, he started to lack power, tried out the revamped mechanic class and it was much more powerful.     Overall, I give this game a rating sentence of... Very mixed, but finding fun without pay to win stuff is a likely chance with the right mindset.",

It says I have 0 hours logged because I've haven't been playing it on steam, but I've probably wasted well over a thousand hours on this thing. There's this thing called the cash shop. You can buy a crap ton of stuff from the cash shop, but there's a catch, it's all temporary. You buy a thing and then it disappears after, say, 90 days. I feel like this rips you off so damn much. But if you play for long enough, you come by more than enough events, So you don't have to spend any money. But the thing is, if you actually want to get cool stuff like chairs and good looking clothes with amazing stats on them, you HAVE TO spend a crap ton of time in game grinding on mobs. So if you want to get good at this game without spending any money on it, it's possible, but you have to have a ♥♥♥♥ ton of time on your hands on your hands. Also, to be tolerant of this game, you have to be tolerant of anime. If you want to be good at this game without spending money OR time, give up, it's impossible. Unless you have someone else play for you... I guess...? But what's the point of that?

            "review_text": "NOTE: This is a very big 'IF' recommendation.  This game is made by a greedy company that only cares about getting money. Wether the developpers of the game care or not, they are probably forced into decisions that realllly encourage paying. That is, if you actually plan on playing the game efficiently.  This game is simple, unless you're going into high level end game raids with people, that is the only time I can think where this game gets complexe and requires actual planning.  Until then, most of the game is litteraly just pressing a single OP power button and watching a screen full of enemies dying with massive numbers showing up on screen?  So WHY would I recommend this game?  Because somehow, MapleStory makes that sensless room clearing one shotting grinding for days entertaining to watch.  Its not complex, its not complicated, pick the weapon with the highest stats, apply all your buff/debuffs, then just spam away with that one attack that fills the whole screen with pretty explosions and lights and make you feel somehow like you're REALLY powerful, way over the top, and just sit back and enjoy the fireworks.  That's really all you do, and when you reach the job advancements, you suddenly get even cooler looking and prettier powers to enjoy.  And now they have a 5th job advancements with even BIGGER and PRETTIER attacks to use.  Their are so many choices, all the classes, all the different job advancements, just choose what looks the coolest to you, find the nearest NPC that tells you where to go to kill 100 enemies or collect 100 items of one type, go there, and just watch and have fun seeing massive numbers pop up.  But if none of that sounds fun, if you're looking for a well polished, super complex RPG, you wont like this game for the first 100 levels or more. I've heard that the end game raids can be tough and require a planned out raid party, no idea if its true, I never got that far. But the time it takes to reach that level isn't as bad as it looks since this game loves its level up events where you get like 3 levels per level up, slicing the time it takes to 1/3 of the ammount. Either way, it still takes a bit though. And in the end, the game still isn't as complex as some other MMORPG, I'm not an expert but I've heard better from other MMORPG games, so look elsewhere for super in depth and interesting MMORPG games.   But if you're looking for some time to kill, to just sit back and watch things die as you watch some stream or youtube video or you're just waiting for something to be done, this game does a surprisingly good job, for free. All the in game purchases are usually for people who want to level faster or who want to get end game stuff quicker or reaaaallly max out their characters but, if you're just trying to kill time, this game does an amazing job at entertaining you for a few hours before you move on with your life.  I'll never take this game seriously, but if I'm ever bored and got nothing to do, this game is always one of my go to picks for killing time and simply having a casual fun time with the game.  Once again, no idea exactly how complex this game gets at the higher levels, I'm sure it does get 'better' later on as any hardcore maplestory player might say. But until you get to that point, it all depends on how much you enjoy watching hundred of enemies fall to that massive screen filling energy blast you just used.",

When I first start playing I pick the old Dawn Warrior as my starter class and I ended up loving it. I put alot of work and money just to make it to 120 and.. I never did. Back then leveling up was much more challenging and I'd say it's alot of fun. Now after I recently played again and create a new Hero class called 'Shade'level up from 10 to 120, I said to myself'What the heck happen to the game?' I thought I was a pro, but it turned out the game was now just too easy. I even got bored of training and nowadays, trainings is just a labor you want to do.  Bosses are now too easy most only required 1 player doing a solo run,not even breaking a sweat.Now it's the amount of money i don't always likes, the poor amount of money after a lv.10 mob dropped is ranged from 8-20 mesos(in-game currency) while a piece of equipment lv.10 cost 1k and you might think thats easy but a lv.50 cost about 55k+.Still,it's not the money I'm complaining, it's the fun I had thats gone.I could have recommended this game but those days are over,the gameplay feels so hollow now.  If you play this game anyway, you'll regret it.  P.S I know it said I play zero hours,but trust me I play it on the official website.",

Then you can do the gollux boss and commerci quest line to sell gollux shop equips by getting coins from easy mode, and cubic blades from commerci. A shop you can aquire from the maple rewards shop by killing bosses if you can, or doing star planet (easily attainable in a few hours from star planet). Sell your gollux shop equips and cubic blades that you acquiered over a month or so, you will be able to make a few hundred mil or so. Buy your chaos root abyss equips. Buy your reinforced gollux pendant / belt. Commerci will give you your already epic'd face and eye equip. Shoe and glove can be obtained by doing normal root abyss and opening the shoe / glove box with coins to achieve the 100% chance to go up tier per cube. Badge attained through ghost ship questline, emblem through boss arena, rings through the gollux shop (should have sold 1 out of the 4) and the other ring that drops from bosses, earring through gollux shop, cape can be anything until you can afford tyrant cape. Once you attained all of your equips you can epic pot all of them through epic pot scrolls provided in every single event shop which we have almost 24/7. Once you epic an item you can cube it from using cubes from bosses (since you can boss somewhat now), or cubes from the reward shop (get points from bossing or star planet). Also i forgot about scrolling which can be done through spell traces (20 crusader coins = 100 traces ~ crusader coins dropped from bosses), or event shop scrolls. Thats it, not pay 2 win, pay 2 save yourself from spending time on all of this.",

            "review_text": "This game has been on Steam since 2012 I believe. Since then, Nexon has gone through countless updates, time and time again, breaking Steam MS. I was forced to play MS through the website most of the time. This was not the issue. I have been playing MS since a month out of Beta. It was the best thing to happen to me, to date. However, what really got me down was when my friends quit, or I got hacked, or if I was being ks'ed, etc. I remember when Victoria Island was the only continent and there were only 4 Adventurers and HPQ was the only pq. Everything changed after the BB patch. It became SO much easier to level up that anyone could get 120 levels within 24 hours, without 2x EXP. The game changed from being too hard to too easy, it was ridiculous. Now, though, Nexon has finally caught up to all of the demands of the Veterans and have made the game harder to level up from level 30-60 and 170-200, which are the prime levels. After many updates to nerf the OP grind fest and 24 hours max leveling, the veterans are now complaining that the game is too hard. Ha! Too easy now too hard? Pick a side and stick with it, I thought. I'm starting to agree with them though, the game has become harder than it was after the BB patch, but it's still easier than before. The major updates, like Chaos, Legends, and Jump were all very exciting, especially if you play with friends. This game is hugely based on friends. It is SO boring without friends to play with. The game actually rewards you for playing with your friends now, apparently. I used to have MS open 24 hours per day for 7 days a week, even though I wasn't there to play myself - I just wanted to have it open for when I got home. (That's kind of exaggerated; My longest time on MS was only 77 hours, after which I had dc'd).  If you were to ask me what MS is about, I couldn't tell you. There is just so much to it, you have to experience it yourself. But let me warn you. The game doesn't like new players. It feeds on the old ones, like me, who have characters over level 150 (the max being 250). I really like it though. if I were to start all over, I'd only be willing to do it with friends (and if I had the time. I basically have no time for MS anymore because of school).  Back to Steam MS though. This Steam version is weird. It sometimes works and it sometimes doesn't work. Many people experience trouble with the Steam version for a variety of issues: someone typed in the wrong email address, and so you can't change it; someone forgot their pin; the game doesn't load for some people; and the list goes on. My suggestion would to just play MS through the website if it doesn't work on Steam.  Please disregard the amount of hours I have played MS on Steam. 80% hours are just from me afk'ing A LOT. The other 20% of those hours are me enjoying the game with my (now-dead) friends.

Every Saturday morning, I'd wake up extra early, start up the family computer, and run this game. And oh, the hours of fun I'd have. Killing the Orange Mushrooms, only to be killed in a matter of seconds by the pesky Green ones(MapleStory veterans will know). Celebrating every level up as if it were my birthday. Challenging the Jr. Balrog at the end of the SleepyWood caves, and him killing me with one shot. All of those are now qualities of MapleStory that people no longer feel(unless it's on a private server that runs the old MapleStory), which, you know, sucks. Now, at level 10, you can one-shot every Mushroom(except Mushmom). Leveling up is made way too easy, and Jr. Balrog might as well just be a dungeon for Level 40ish characters. The game changed. And the change was good... for a while. Eventually, the continous growth eventually cummulated to the Big Bang. That's when things got... weird. The game just became... different. That was when the very atmosphere of the game changed for the worst. That's when the game accomplishments just became... unsatisfying. As someone who played this in Beta, who downloaded the game at the actual Nexon site, this game did... go down in quality. While my opinion may differ from others, this is just mine. A couple of months after the Big Bang, this game, once one of the best MMORPG's of all time, just became another game of 'Press a couple of buttons, kill everything, loot, repeat'. A 'Grindfest', if you will.   In conclusion, this game was good. It probably is still good, and I just didn't play it. However, It just doesn't have the same ring to it. Unlike the good ol' days, this game gets boring after a couple hours. However, I will say that those couple of hours will be one of the best gaming experiences you'll ever have. Or so I think.   TL;DR: Good game, gets boring in a couple hours, but still try it.",

People excuse it away with 'oh but it's just five dollars for a pet'. The amount of money you have to pay for the feature is zero dollars. It should come with the game. Strongarming players into purchases is a rubbish business tactic that only results in cheaters and private servers like there are now and it's a known fact that Nexon themselves are throttling the rate at which players can loot items to try and sell pets. There are plenty of other places I can take that 'just five dollars' and more than likely they'll involve pressing more than just SHIFT and ALT for hours on end.",

            "review_text": "I started playing Maplestory years ago. There were three classes, with a fourth not entirely finished yet. Speed ahead, the number is probably 30 or more, and what has the game got to show for it? About 5GB's, apparently. Maplestory is a seemingly simple game when it comes to design, however, this is an understatement in magnitudes. The amount of detail put into the tiniest of things is fairly impressive, and the overall composition is balanced, visually at the least. To quantify it, I'd give it a 9 of 10, as it has a very certain style that it has kept to for many years, improving it with each update.  The game, the game, you are probably criping about. The game is... Well, bland, if you let it be. The original Maplestory would take upward of hundreds of hours to gain only a few number of levels, often resulting in the player gaining access to OTHER ways of burning hundreds and hundreds of hours. My first account was around level 70 before it was lost to the stupidity of youth. It took some two years of leisure play, that as I now look back at, was sickening. The Maplestory today has enacted a story-line for the player to follow, one that of course, is entirely optional, but is largely beneficial to the player seeking to access everything in a timely manner. From the start to 70 again, it took roughly 12-24 hours in total play time. Some quests would level the player massively, and this made for a huge jump in playability. Yet... in doing this it crippled the need to explore a lot of the lower-level maps. You find yourself swamping back and forth in the same few areas that match your level range, seeing the same monsters over and over until the quest and level set is complete.  Why play this, you ask? When you can get a set of people to join you, it's a genuinely remember-able experience. Bosses in this game are NOT easy to take alone, and you'll often need to coordinate in a huge number of ways. Thankfully, each class HAS A PLACE. The game has a balance between each class that makes it so when the individual is party-searching, they aren't met with any EXTREME class bias. Aside from the healer being chosen first. But say you are alone, what then is there to amuse you? WELL! Discovering all this constantly expanding world has to offer. The quests are endless, and if you don't fancy doing them, just kill things! Each monster (after a certain level) has a different set of attacks that you'll need to account for. You'll be hard-pressed to find a situation where you can just spam one attack infinitely (not to say there aren't opportunities). On this, each class has a moderate-to-diverse range of available moves that will require a balance to use in a successful manner. Hotkeys a plenty, the user will likely stick between 5-6 moves they prefer, and use them as the situation calls need. This game can be played ANY TIME, there is rarely a situation where you are FORCED to stay on or else feel some emotional, internal struggle, when you leave it behind. It's simple to pick up... sorta?  In recent years, the game has been working on adding and building on the game... without much improving what is there? They've added personality traits that influence your ability, POTENTIAL for weapons that influence them in some way or another, and yet, it looks clunky and visually, confusing. When I joined, it was a simple set of 5-6 buttons and the buttons to operate these menus as appropriate. Now, you'll be bombarded with tabs on tabs of flashing icons that all HOPE to enhance your playing experience. Usually... it just leaves you confused. The game has made strides in playability, enjoyableness, and the content that is available to all without the need to throw money at the screen. Yet, it still has a while to go. To again, quantify it, I'd give it an 8 of 10, as what it has added has enriched the content, by being oblivious to mechanical things that desperately need improvement.   I'd say, play the game, give it a few hours, and you'll probably end up playing it once or twice a week out of the sheer quantity within it you'll have to discover. ",

The diablo aspect comes in when you start gearing. Some time since I played this game 6 years ago and now, Nexon added a really simple way to upgrade your gear. I won't go into /too/ much detail here but the jist of it is you can make all your gear really powerful for cheap. when I hit level 100 (normally about 8 hours into the game), I got a set of gear that I upgraded and is still viable at my curent level (150). all of my items have an affix like (+7, 8 stars) and they glow in fancy colors adding to the badass 'feel' of the game. as long as you don't compair your self to other player who have been playing longer, you'll feel like a maplestory god only 12 hours into the game.

Combining MMORPG elements with minor 2d platforming works well, and there's a reason MapleStory is still one of the world's most popular MMOs even after being around for over a decade. Still, if you dislike microtransactions, be warned: This is one of the greediest games of it's kind I've played. Most cash items only last for 90 days, but cost the same as permenant cosmetics in other games. Still, even without spending a dime, it's the kind of game that should provide enjoyment for the MMO or RPG enthusiast.",

The game has a lot of classes, but the primary classes are warrior, magician, thief, bowman(archer), and pirate. The warrior is your standard damage dealer with high defenses. The mage has powerful magic attacks but bad defenses unless you have a buff that reduce damage. The theif does major damage up close(dagger) or from afar(claw) while using stealth. The bowman uses either a bow or a crossbow dealing critical damage. The pirate is like the theif minus the stealth and replacing daggers with knuckles and claws with guns. PVP used to be level 30 to enter but and update made it level 70. In the game the world or mapleworld and yes that is its world is called was ruled by a dark wizard or otherwise the black mage until five(six) sealed him away but the cost was that they were fronzen for hundreds of years. In its latest update 'Grand Atheneaum' shows how the black mage came to be. Some of the community can imature but I usually ignore it. If you don't like the community the content is what might get you hooked on this game. There are some events where some classes will be availible; like the ZERO class where you start from level 100 until you hit 180 so you escape mirror world where s/he is seal. seriously zero's story can be REAL funny. At level 30, then to, 60 and finaly 100 and the rumored 5th job advancement. The community accuses other 2D RPG's of being a ripoff(bull).

            "review_text": "I started playing Maplestory in June of 2005, just weeks after its was released to the North American region. Man, the memories I had wasting my time on this game. Even though I stopped around early 2007, I will never forget those two years where I wasted my life playing the game. The summers of 2005 and 2006 where I played non-stop with friends, those cold-winter days where I did quest runs with randoms, and those Saturday nights playing the game while watching the Boondocks on Adult Swim.   Even though I had a lot of fond memories of Maplestory, it was not that good of a game. With the arrival of the NX-Shop in late 05/early 06, the game's model turned from Free MMO to Free to Pay. It might have been the first instance I have experienced F2P. At first, the Nexon Shop offered cosmetic upgrades and various useless as fu  ck trinkets; it was fine at first. Slowly but surely, the OP game-breaking weapons started pouring in. By the start of 2007, Maplestory was littered with alternate accounts/players boosting from low levels to ridiculously high levels in the matter of a few hours; all they had to do was shell out a couple of dollars. It was at this point, the Maplestory community turned toxic. If all the xXAzNnAbuGo1995Xx names didn't ruin it for you, the di  ck measuring contests and the constant fleecing might have.  Naturally, I took a break from the game for a good year and a half. I came back in the summer of 2008, and what do you know? Still the same bullsh  it as last time. From that point, I completely gave up on Maplestory, uninstalled it from my computer, and tried blocking anything MS related from my head.    Fast-forward to 2016. I was browsing the Free-Game section on Steam, saw it, and thought to myself 'why not? Let's see if it changed a single bit.' So I downloaded it, had to restore my Nexon account, and renew the credentials in order to play it. Got it up and running, and played it for a bit. Here are my thoughts.   THE GOOD:  + My account somehow survived 8 years of inactivity. Though my character names got fu  cked in the process. (see THE BAD for more details)  + My friend's list remained intact, even though most of my friends had their names messed up too.  + All of my items, equips, weapons, and quests - including completed, finished, and in progress - were retained too!  + It's really easy to level up. Some long-time players think this is a bad thing, but not me. It used to take so long to level up back in the early days. To give you some perspective: it would take 2 hours to get from level 41 to level 42 (no matter your character's profession) in 2005/2006, now it takes 4 hours to get from level 40 to level 50.   + Dat music doe. It hits me right in the nostalgia, and it's pretty rockin too.   THE BAD:  - Character names on inactive accounts were changed into a long-string of numbers. If you had not logged in since 2013, your characters will have fu  cked numbers for names because Nexon purged some useless data from their servers.  - There's only 3 screen resolutions in the game: 800 x 600, 1024 x 768, and 1368 x 768. Trying to modify the screen resolution will result in a ban from Nexon, so don't even think about it. It's 2016, and Nexon can't even be pressed to provide support for 1920 x 1080. What the fu  ck.  - The game still runs in 16bit color mode. I understand the sprites were created as early as 2001 or even 2000, but it's just inexcusable to see those color dots all over the screen.   - Main function keys are still not rebindable. I'm sorry Wizet/Nexon, I do not like moving my character with my right hand. Can you at least allow us to rebind it to WASD?  - The world map is still a bit  ch to navigate.   - Game still has spotty netcode. Those iconic hiccups were you might teleport from one side of the map to the other is still here.  - NX Shop has an even stronger presence than before.  - The community is effectively dead; no one is playing anymore. It's really weird to see the Scania server have open slots in their 20 channels.    THE MIXED:  ~ Controller support. There is finally support for game pads, and unfortunately it's very spotty (my PS3 controller's d-pad was not recognizable). However, your standard console pads do not have enough buttons to accomodate various functions, especially when you get into the higher levels and need a lot of hotkeys.  ~ Cut-scenes. I don't think there were cut-scenes in MS when I started playing, so it's a nice addition. However, most of these cut-scenes are unskippable and a pain in the a  ss to watch.     Overall, I cannot recommend this game for newcomers, but I do recommend it for old-timers who want to get back in and play it for old-time's sake. However, the game is on its deathbed. Nexon is contemplating on retiring the service by the end of this decade. Before that happens, Maplestory 2 will have more than likely be localized to the states. For those who are wondering, yes there is a Maplestory 2, and yes it is garbage. It has Maplestory aesthetics, combined with isometric ARPG gameplay with Minecraft's voxel influence mixed in.  rating as of this moment: 5/10.",

You have no need for much money in this game but it doesn't stop you from asking for large amounts of it from strangers. You have a wide range of emotes such as crying and angry face to aid you in your money or meso requests. Is that guy ignoring you? Start crying. If he says no? Initiate angry face.   Do you like being followed and constantly asked if you are single? Play a female character. It will increase your begging abilities ten fold as players will often simple walk up to and drop free items in order to impress you.   As money serves no real purpose in this game for low levels, you can use your begging donations to create riots as you drop the money in extremely small quantities on the ground in crowded areas. Don't you worry, they will swarm on that money like flies on feces regardless of the amount of money.",

But that being said, this is my review for the game.  I like the idea of a side scrolling RPG like this and I tend to play with friends on ANY and EVERY game that I can. So to start off it was fun and the idea of being our own things seems like hella fun. However, it doesn't get far with this concept as this game takes stupid amounts of grinding and hours from you. As if that's not bad enough from the start, add in the players farming the best exp areas to death taking from the ones who actually need it. Okay, so find a lesser people infested area. Easier said than done. If you do find an area with less players it's most likely because of the number of hackers in that area clearing mass mobs instantly. By the time you find yourself some exp to gain you only grind for a few hours before losing interest and logging. And of course there's only so many times you can do this before you quit all together.   The graphics are a nice anime looking touch and it's pretty easy to find your friends. But unless you have 0 to do in your life and the #(*%#* tons of spare time needed to achieve anything don't bother.",

There are so many things out there that it will take you quite a while to enjoy them all.

I don't think Maplestory is as much fun as it was back then. Every character of the same 'Class' (I.E Adventurer, Noblesse, Resistance, I honestly don't know what it's called anymore) are all repetitve. If you have an adventurer, you just go to Henesys to do some quests, grind there, then done. You get to 60 and that's when it REALLY starts getting reptitive. You just start doing the same PQ's over and over again to level. If you want variety, you're gonna be doing other quests that either; don't have players, or quests that barely give EXP. You do PQ's until around 100, then you do more PQ's till I believe it was 150. And then you go to the Gate of the Future. You grind there.  Basically, to level. you just grind until a certain level, and keep doing certain Party Quests until you're too high to do them anymore, then you move to one grind area. Oh, and you'll have difficulty doing those PQ's unless you're P2P. (Pay to Play) because Maplestory basically rewards you for spending as much money as you can on it. If you don't want to pay much, then it will take you YEARS to get good gear, unless you have a really nice friend.  Back then, you had variety, people did other things, you had so many PQ's that weren't instant level givers, and you had fun doing other PQ's. Classes weren't OP, you were decent even if you didn't pay too much, and it, overall, was slower but better back then. Hackers reign nowadays. Maplestory nowadays has just gotten repetitive.",

            "review_text": "==Skip down for TLDR for pros cons and overall - Read on about NOSTALGIA==  Its the game that started me on MMORPGs. What brought me to it today was the nostalgia from way back in 2006 and what brought me to it back then was an interesting challenge by an friend of mine to 'beat the game', in which I found the meaning of this phrase after many many hours of playing the game means something completely different to what I originally interpreted it for single player games on my handy Playstation 2 console and nintendo handheld devices.  So in the end, my 12 year old self was drawn into awe by the anime/cartoon style graphics, including clothing/armor designs and the cute (so-called) monsters, and (at the time) amazing soundtrack. One of which, the sleepywood soundtrack which led to my first ever avatar, a low level mage, to become traped in the village of sleepywood with no clear way of getting passed the higher level creatures but left to enjoy such a calm and relaxing song while he tried all methods his little 12 year old brain could come up with.  What killed it was the amount of time needed to level up. This forced me to seek out private servers, as I began to notice the time the game was taking from my real life responsibilities. This meaning, while playing for at max 1 hour every day (sometimes every 2 days), I would go sometimes weeks without leveling up or completing certain quests. This, coupled with the fact that I wasnt getting along with the majority of the community, mostly because the people I seemed to be getting mixed up in seemed to be closed off, isolated, EMOtional and downright rude ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, not to mention my original account was hijacked by someone I once thought was my friend, the young 12 year old boy I was back then didnt need all that drama in his life. However, I*m not going to take this review down that path, people cant control their audiences and I am not in the mood to make a lengthy, detailed and EMOtional review but I will be damned if it dosent atleast contribute to an MMO and the overall game.  Although my strongest traits growing up were my immeasurable amount of patience and persistents, the above two problems were my main reasons leading to my 'ending' to the game, although not on a sour note, to seek another game to spend what little spare time I had as an active child. Having returned to the game once again as an adult, I find that I have simply outgrown it and I am unable to enjoy my time here in the Maple world as I did so many years ago. Regardless, Maple Story will always be remembered as my first ever MMORPG. It and my brave little avatars will always hold a special place in my heart.  ===================================TL;DR==============================================  These are based on what I have seen as of 2015/2016 compared to 2006.  Pros -Cute characters and avatars -Easy to level up (may appeal to casual players, however... *skip to cons second point*) -Chill soundtrack -Good place to get started if new to MMORPGs (This point might be outdated but I still stand by it) -Game has been out for a while, seen many updates and many guides from veterens.  Cons -Nexon store (Items may not appeal to all, perhaps I have outgrown the style.) -Ease of level up may not appeal to all nor may it sit well with old players. -Does questing matter anymore?  -Jump quests. Just- dont ask. -Massive list of classes does not appeal to all veteren players.  (Potential Con - mostly unresearched or observed from other players reactions) -The community in Maple Story has not always been great. There seems to be a bit of a change in the attitude of the community as a new generation of gamers arrive. I havnt really stuck around long enough to analyze it. The stigma of my time in 2006 still lingers.  Some complain about the immaturity of the community, 'full of 12 year olds', but what do you expect from a game appealing to that age group of which most people started playing.   -Some people have complained of the games emphasis on damage nowadays. I thought this was standard since, well, since forever.  Overall Still a good place as any to start your adventure in the massive open world of MMORPGs. There are other options out there nowadays, however, there is no reason why you shouldnt give this old veteren among MMOs a go. KEEP IN MIND - If you are a returning player, you may not fall inlove with this old MMO as you did back in the day. People tend to find that they will outgrow the things they once enjoyed as a child or adolescent and this may be one of those things. Come for the nostaligia, see what the Maple World has been up to since you left and adventure again if you fancy, atleast for a little while - in memory of our veteren avatars.",

Much more than my steam profile shows I have played since the games inception back when I was only 10 this game has been around for awhile, and its focus went from buying cosmetics to almost mandatory spending in order to progress. Let me tell you this if you are a new player you are @$#%ed the games economy is broken, a new player will not have anyway to make enough money to buy the gear required to progress past level 150 mind you this is when endgame begins, so you will either have to beg, or buy from the reason the economy is f@#$ed goldfarming websites. Thats not it sadly, even when you get this gear it must be cubed and scrolled in order to make it strong enough for you to farm cygnus knights to continue to level. Cubes while can be obtained in game are rare REALLY rare, and the amount to teir up gear can average about 40-60 you can get lucky sometimes people have gotten a teir up in only one cube but its rare. Explaining how cubing works would be confusing for players who havent reached that point so all I will say is this. IF you WANT to boss and farm effectively and have fun doing so YOU will have to spend at least 200 dollars in NX. If you get true endgame gear it can cost 500-1000 dollars. I dont recommend this game to people for the sheer fact that is forces one to spend such HUGE amounts of cash on a game that while fun is not at all worth that kind of invesement; however if you have the money to do so and wish to try the game then go ahead.",

If u are person that is attracted to cool looking 'animations' this game could be hit or miss for u. This game can be really fun if played in certain ways and playing with friends is highly reccomended because of how grindy this game is. The level of grinding goes beyond any game ever , by grinding i could mean numerous things such as grinding exp(experience) to acheieve a high level , grinding item drops that drop from certain monsters in the game, grinding for quest items. I reccomended doing alot of quests even though its not the fastest way to level up because of how boring the game can actually get after awhile. Regardless this is a very addicting game in my opinion and i think its worth checking out if u wanted to try it. Also the game will probably see a decrease in updates due to nexon workin on maplestory 2 which is(to me) a game worth checking out because it looks freaking cool and it has a nice style to it",

I have put in more than $3000 into my last account and have a 1m+ dmg range (Approximately 30m CL HITS (x7, on Infinity, on Bosses), on an I/L Arch Mage, and have 3 level 200+ characters. I have put in more grind hours than most people have played video games, ever. I have played a LOT of this game.  The end-game is one massive money sink. If you thought other P2W games were bad, this one forces you to gamble on stats for a minor increase in damage, each gamble costing upwards of $1.50. For a single roll. Think about how many times people pull that lever in a slot machine for 25c, and then think about that lever costing $1.50. And it's not for a single jackpot, no. You have to hit the jackpot 10+ times for all of your items, until the next OP item rolls in so you can dump your cash in there.  Honestly this game is amazing in of itself. If it wasn't for the P2W and me finally realizing how much of my money I was wasting on this garbage, I would play this game religiously as I once did. However, the majority of the 'real' end-game content is locked behind huge gear walls (paywalls in reality), and it's kind of sad to see such a great social game crash and burn because of it.  Don't waste your time. Don't waste your money. Avoid this like AIDS.",

To be honest, I'm not sure what to say about this game, the more you play it, the more you garner a Love/hate relationship toward it.   Granted, there's an ABSOLUTE TON of stuff to do, whether it's explore the world as one of the five original classes, or take on a storyline as a Cygnus Knight; Dual Bladed Ninja; fighting the oppresion of the Black Knights in Edelstein; or maybe as one of the five Hero Classes of the world? Seriously, there's a lot to do.  And yet, there's a lot to complain, mainly you'll hear how Leveling was once a chore before 'Big Bang', or 'Pirates should never have been added!' But to be honest? Why should that matter? When I started playing back in 2008, just to get to level 30 was a monumental task of about two weeks of daily grinding. Nowadays you can get to Lvl 50 in a few days if you're smart.  Plus, I keep hearing about the Cashshop. Last I checked it was just a cosmetics shop with minimal convinences like teleports or weapon skins. Still, to each their own.  Should you play this game?  Depends. Do you want to get suckered into Nostalgia and keep coming back to this game in the years to come just like I have since 2010?  Still, it's free...  EDIT: I was hoping to add more recent thoughts to this after reinstalling the game and experience the new changes.  Turns out Nexon had other plans.  I recently moved cross country, and along that came with a new Internet router. It's just so happens, that whoever had my IP last got not only banned.  But IP banned. thus shutting me out of the game just because I came at a later date.   It's been a week and Nexon still hasn't responded to my emails about this. So I'm forced to turn to private servers. IF ONLY THEY WEREN'T ALL RUNNING A GAME VERSION FROM BEFORE THE BIG BANG UPDATE. HOLY FLYING BICYCLE.  As a result of this, I'm changing my recommendation to No.   Do not get sucked into this game. You WILL come back to it years later. Save yourself.",

Due to my long standing membership, I've gotten a few extra things as well, which is a good way to pay back people who played it back when it was just gaining footing.   Pros: - Class variety. Deviates from the pre-WoW class set up (Archer, Warior, Mage, Cleric, Thief, Pirate) into something more unique to any other MMO I've played.  - Despite it being a 2-D sprite game, it has some gorgeous areas and interesting lore, be it simplstic.  - Events really help new and old players alike.  - EXP system works well even for post Lvl. 100 players.  - Fair loot system.  - Not Pay 2 Win. - Easy to use party system.  Cons: - Crafting is a bit borring, but isn't required. - No gay marriage option as of Jan. 2 2016. - Marriage glitch where you cannot break your ring throughthe proper NPC. - Hackers, while less prevelant, will still be around. How to spot them is that they auto- party RQ once you enter a map.  - WHY IS EVERYTHING SO CUTE. I FEEL BAD.  - Some artwork needs to be patched in from the Korean ver.     If you're interested, I play on BERA. BERA used to be one of the most populated servers, but has since dropped in that regard.    I completely recomend this MMO to people who are sick of the cookie cutter 3D MMOs that populate the rosters... or aren't GW2 or FF14.",
