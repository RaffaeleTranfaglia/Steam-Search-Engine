            "review_text": "Alekhine's Gun was ment to be Death to Spies 3 few years back, but development was paused due original publisher backed out. So now 5 years later we have Alekhine's Gun stealth action game that still have traces of old development that can be seen on textures of floor, walls and lightning. However all rest of models and textures are awesome and AAA looking, music and sounds are great too.   Gameplay is unique and in a way original because you are able to finish missions in many many various ways that will determen your overall score. When I say various ways, I mean that you will have your task, but how will you do it, what approach will you use it is all depending on your overall gameplay, will you interact with certant objects that will trigger something, or someone... the amount ways doing a missions is just impressive!  So yea overall this is great assassin game, where you will go trough history from WW2 to after war times. Maybe the only con I can pull out of this is that is releasing at same time as new Hitman, and I'm afraid it can be in it's shadow.  I'm honestly recommending this game to everyone.",

            "review_text": "If you liked Death to Spies 1 and/or 2, this game is probably for you.  If you didn't like those games, don't bother with this one.  If you haven't played those games ... play them first, then come back to this one if you like them. When I bought this game, I didn't know it was Death to Spies 3 (essentially). I remember early on thinking, 'Huh, my character looks familiar ... and they sure ripped off Death to Spies a lot ...' I had to check, and sure enough, this is the pheonix from the ashes of a failed attempt to make Death to Spies 3.  If you've tried Death to Spies and you like it, then this game is probably worth buying. Though, a couple words of advise; save often AND IN DIFFERENT SLOTS because I have had saved games go corrupt. This game crashes on a fairly regular basis, and while they claim to be working on it, I still randomly get crashes. And there's no windowed mode, so if that's a deal breaker for you -- well, consider yourself warned.  This game is NOT the caliber of Hitman. It's not gloriously and beautifuly rendered, but it's not ugly. And I'll be honest, I can't tell you what the story's about -- I tried to follow it, but lost it in the midst of cutscenes. That doesn't really matter, anyway, it's an excuse to sneak, explore, and find creative ways to end people that someone's assuring us are bad. I don't remember the stories from Death to Spies, either, for what it's worth.  If you're the sort that wants a beautiful, perfect game and can't deal with the occasional crash -- don't bother.  But if you're okay with a rough diamond, enjoy this one and save often :) Seriously, save your game. Different slots, too. Really!",

            "review_text": "Think Hitman meets a good story and you will have an understanding of Alekhine's Gun. Without giving the plot away, you are a spy doing spy stuff while the greater story unfolds around you. The ability to sneak around, use of equipment, and the occasion body removal from problematic location help advance your story.  What I did not like about the game was all the crashes. The game just comes to abrupt halt and crashes to the desktep. Doesn't happen often; but enough to ruin the pace of the story.",

Turns out, I would have rather gone and played a Splinter Cell game that was released in 2005. The game idea is awesome but the game itself is crap...honestly. You will have to muster up all the courage you possibly can to will your way through each mission. The game was decent to play but the reason I am giving it a negative review is because they claimed they fixed a lot of bugs and mainly the crashes. THE CAKE IS A LIE! They did not fix the crashes, I crashed more than a drunk woman driving at night time when she forgot her perscription glasses at home so she's using a pair she bought at Wal Mart. Anyways, don't think this game is worth the money, buy it when it goes on sale. That is, if you can handle the crashes (Seriously, it crashed all the time!)",
