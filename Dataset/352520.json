            "review_text": "The Silent Age is a game which I started with low expectations, and ended up being quite impressed with it. It is a Point &amp; Click adventure game with time travel mechanics, in which the main character can change between two different time periods. Sometimes it is required that you go back to the past, gather an item from the past, take it with you to the future, and solve a puzzle to progress through the story. With this gameplay mechanic, Silent Age becomes a very unique game.  The game's visually beautiful with simplistic artstyle, which can vary from very colorful and vivid in the past, and very dreadful in the future since it's a post-apocalyptic world. The simple visuals do lower the difficulty of the game in general. It's easy to notice which items need to be picked up or interacted with, making the puzzles not that hard but still fun to crack. The game's pacing is well done, due to the fact that most of the puzzles are intuitive if you're paying attention to details. While that may be a turn off for some people, I like the idea of basic puzzles to keep the story going, while still being engaging from chapter to chapter.  There are 10 chapters in The Silent Age, each chapter feels unique and not repetitive at all. Chapter 10 does have a bit of backtracking in the beginning though. I've played a fair share of Point &amp; Click games in my lifetime, and this became one of my favorites. The story is great since I'm a sucker for time travel and dark themes, the visuals are simplistic yet gorgeous in it's way, the voice acting is above average and believable and the ambient sounds in an almost non-existent soundtrack helps to set up the atmosphere of The Silent Age.  The value of the game is subjective (as always), but I'd say 10€ is worth it if you are into Point &amp; Click adventures and Time Traveling mechanics, although it is a short game and shouldn't take more than 3.5 hours to complete. 8/10",

            "review_text": "Hey! Very nice little point and click adventure. Unexpected!  The game is quite short (I guess about 3 hours, unless you get stuck on the puzzles but I doubt that) but very entertaining. All the puzzles are very logical and you will never be like 'WTF?!?', sadly that happens in many point and click games....where the solutions to the puzzle sometimes don't make any sense at all.  The game is very straightforward, meaning that as soon as you find an object (they are all pretty easy to find) you'll know exactly what you will have to do with it, if you look at the environment carefully. Once an object lost its utility, it will be removed from the inventory, sparing you all the try and errors resulting caused by object incompatibilities....so in that way, the game is fairly simple but not boring, you still need some puzzle solving skills.  Not every line has voice acting (there is no voice acting when your character is alone, because he is thinking and not talking), and there are not many dialogues, but the ones that are in the game are interesting and develop the story.  You will have to deal with   time traveling   both for solving puzzles and for understanding the story. There is no paradox in my opinion, again, sadly, this happened in many other movies/games with the same subject....when you will go 'WTF????' at the end. This is not the case, everything makes sense and you can take the time to think about the storyline and sequence of events. This adds a bit of replayability maybe, for those interested in playing the game from the beginning with the known ending already in mind.  Recommended, but short. So up to you if you want to pay full price (10 euros at the moment) for such a short (and valid) game or not.",

For those that have not played on iOS, the game really nailed the post-apocalyptic time travel adventure game, buy having you swap between 2 time periods. Also the story is the right level of confusing, and comes clean in the end. This almost feels like Portal the Adventure game.  Also the puzzles are right on, just like Portal and you can finish this in a few hours. I got through in just under 4, but I did remember the first half. I also like how some of the achievements are for wrong puzzle solutions. Well happy gaming, and hope you like this as much as I did.",

            "review_text": "Silent Age is the story of Joe, a janitor guy of a big American corporation, who's at the wrong place at the wrong time. With his security clearance updated due to a recent promotion he finds himself in the sublevels of the company building and before he could say mop and sponge he discovers a dying man who tasks him with the saving of the world.  Now, what is interesting in this game is the time controlling device you have in your inventory throughout the game. This device allows Joe to switch back and forth between 1972 and 2012. Bothered by a door that is bolted shut and does not let you through? If you travel to the future it will probably be rusted enough for you to kick it in. Similar, not-too-difficult puzzles make this game captivating all the way through to the - for me, at least - surprising ending.  Graphics, voiceover and sound effects are decent enough but it is the game's atmosphere that makes it very good. Currently, it's only 2.5 euros which is not much for seeing a desperate attempt of a janitor guy to save mankind through the end.",

Where suddenly Joe meets an old man, he manages to travel through and throughout time. As the story progresses, the more you get to know.   This game can be very diffcult at times. The first half is fine, until you get to the last half which going through a walkthrough is needed, Espically for people like me who struggle alot with puzzle games.  After all of that, when I finished this game, I had my stomach in a knot for a day as of our mysteriously dark this game is. It has a very creepy vibe to it.   Out of all concerns, the game is a 9/10. The only downside being Puzzles can be a bit too diffcult. Or maybe I'm a dumbass and I can't solve them.",

There are only so many hotspots and the icon changes to a circle if you can interact with something, so no frustrating pixel-hunting to worry about. As I often do with adventure games, I would do the wrong thing to see if any funny dialog would pop up and I wasn't disappointed, this game has a good sense of humor in spite of being serious in tone. If you take your time to explore everything I'd say it is a good 4-5 hour experience. Now I'm going back through to collect the achievements I missed.",

It's somewhat short and fairly straightforward (wouldn't necessarily call it easy or hard).   The time traveling mechanic is very intriguing and easy to use. Mostly every scene of the game has a 1970's setting timeline, and a sort of post-apocalyptic 2012 timeline. You find items in each timeline, and use those items to solve puzzles and advance in the other timeline and vice-versa. It's a very interesting and gripping game mechanic.  If you're looking for a puzzle game that won't eat away all your time, check this game out. It's worth every penny and every second. That's hard to find.",

            "review_text": "I don't know why it took so long for me to decide to start playing Silent Age. It was probably the fact that it was born as a mobile game, which is never a plus as far as I'm concerned (everything that's conceived as a casual game is pretty much going to suck). Anyway, I'm glad I decided to do that during a winter sale, as, besides the amazing art and music, I was rewarded with a very nice gaming experience.  First of all, if you love AG, be aware that this game is pretty short (it took me about 4 hours and I doubt you'll need more), you only use a single button to do everything (Broken Age style, not really a plus in my book but it does its job), and puzzles are not very hard either. Nevertheless, why you'll never get stuck, puzzles are often quite clever, as they'll typically require you to think in terms of present/future terms to work around things.  Time travel is the very premise of this little gem, and you'll immediately find your 'average Joe' main character to be involved in something much bigger than him: a dying messenger from the future and his portable time machine, which you'll have to use to find him (!) and warn him about the apocalypse that is going to come. I won't say more not to spoil the experience (the game is short, as I was saying), but the sci-fi story is really cool and well told: some things may turn up to be more or less predictable, but you'll always find yourself wondering what's going to happen next up to the finale.  Highly recommended!",

You play Joe, who is literally an average Joe in 1972 who comes in contact with time travel and threats of total global annihilation. While none of the puzzles are incredibly difficult (though they had just the right amount of 'aha!' moments to satisfy), the mechanics are solid and the story is amazing. There is a time-travel element that must be used to solve the puzzles, and you get to see glimpses of a desolate future as you switch back and forth between your time and the future. Plus there's a couple of Back to the Future references in there if you're paying attention.  Pros: +GREAT story. Just the right mix between the spooky, eerie feeling of a world about to end, a world already ended, and the light humor of an average Joe who is just trying to figure it all out. +Voice acting is sparse, and mostly just in cutscenes, but what there is of it is good. +Spooky, atmospheric music. The game recommends playing with headphones in, but it's not really necessary (i.e. no puzzles require the ability to distinguish between the direction of sounds, or whatever). However, it does really help to draw you into the game and the world. +Interesting puzzles. Nothing truly groundbreaking, and it's one of those adventure games where items disappear after they're used, so your inventory never gets bogged down with useless crap.  Cons: -Short, but honestly it's still worth it. Took me about 3 hours. -There is a second or two delay between clicking on an item and getting its description (which is always text, not spoken, unfortunately). It's not a big deal, but it really kinda slowed down the game a bit. I'm really stretching here. This isn't game breaking, just a teensy bit annoying after playing the game straight through in one sitting.  9/10. Super great.",
