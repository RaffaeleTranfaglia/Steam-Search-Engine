            "review_text": "WOW! This game has some wonderful qualities to it. The camera is warped in a strange way that forces the eye to focus purely on the action, and it makes me feel in a trance. The levels feel perfectly in tune with the rocking soundtrack, and its just plain fun! To top it off, the developers are bros. I came to the store page looking for music DLC to buy, and I was kinda ♥♥♥♥♥♥ when it wasn't there. That was until I looked in my install directory and realized the devs left the music files there unencrypted, so I was able to put it on my phone and mp3 player! Thanks devs for an awesome game, I hope to master it someday. -PR0XIDIAN",
