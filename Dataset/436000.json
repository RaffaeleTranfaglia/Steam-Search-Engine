It plays like doom with no vertical aim, you don't go flying like you did in the original but it still manages to keep the pace fast. The style and music is pretty much the same, basically feels like you're playing Katamari but you're wasting everyone with a shotgun. 8/10 will be playing a lot of this game.",

It's still fun and fast, with the same great art style, music, and sound effects. Mechanics of each act are interesting and their implementation evolves from level to level. Lovely Planet Arcade feels quite different from the original, but it still delivers the same fun experience. Can't wait for the next iteration of the series!",

            "review_text": "I'm really liking Lovely Planet Arcade. If the first game controlled more like Quake, this one is more like old school DOOM or Wolfenstein 3D. They simplified a lot, but they turned up the puzzle factor a ton. Some enemies will slow down time, others will teleport you to their location, and some will require you to jump to get over their armor. You have to kill enemies in the right order, the right way, and quickly. The trailer doesn't really do it justice. I was really worried about the removal of the y-axis and the limited jump, but I feel this game stands on its own. It's definitely worth the $5 if you're into arcade titles like this. For some reason, they left out the leaderboard. I hope they plan on patching it in, because I loved comparing my scores with my friends.  Don't buy it if you need a storyline and lots of cutscenes.  Do buy if you're a cool person with some patience. It's fun.",

            "review_text": "Same visual style and sound identity as the first game but the gameplay is very different while keeping it's original taste.  My only complain so far is it seams we have less liberty with the route/strat for each level and there is no online score board.  But apart from that, it's still the hardcore fps about optimizing your strategy, memorizing the enemies positions and getting better.",

            "review_text": "I have played Lovely Planet before. That game was brutal but this one's quite easy. However, it's still a challenge. Kind of reminds me of Skulltag and zdoom because of the doom like movement with moderate jumping. The jump is weird. Your character ascends way too fast and then lags downwards. Still a great game.",
