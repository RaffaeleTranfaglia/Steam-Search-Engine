This game is more forgiving than the earlier Rainbow Six games but it is still not for the faint of heart as enemy fire is quickly fatal and may require you play over a section of the game repeatibly until you get it down to a science.  I'd highly recommend this game for someone who likes a challenge and enjoys a somewhat tactical SWAT 4 type experience.",

It's got some good replay value because there's multiple ways you can take your objective, one time breaching explosively through the door, and the next time coming down through the windows on the side of the building.   It's one of my personal favorites, however because it is so old, the online community for it is obviously very, very small, so I'd suggest picking it up if you've got friends to play it co-op with. There's up to 4 player co-op in the story mode, however the co-op was somewhat of an afterthought, so I would suggest putting on the no-respawns setting and playing it on the hard mode as myself and one friend who never played it only both managed to die 3 times through the entire story mode.  I'll recommend it for the co-op primarily.",

Only a few steps into the game and it is already way better than most modern FPSs ! It just perfectly completes Counter-Strike ! This game was made almost 10 years ago and the only potential successor to this perfect Special Forces FPS I can see is the next game in the same series, a.k.a. Rainbow Six : Siege !  Exit Battlefield Hardline ! I cannot believe that nobody manages to reach such a level of fun even today....",

This game was released in 2006, so at this point the visuals are a little dated, but still attractive, and easy to appreciate for their time. The mechanics are excellent, with cover based combat and the team command system, this game is about as intuitive as it gets. You will not find a dislike to have about it.",

I have no idea with other steam users having purcahsed this game but many others like myself are currently suffering launcher issues. Not sure how to fix it, or why the launcher won't update or work, but it sure as hell really brought down my interest for this game, beautiful as the gameplays on YouTube were seen, I just couldn't experience it myself.",

Unbalanced cheap gameplay, with awfull coversystem this game is one of whorse games I've ever played ! Autosave system will drive you mad, since there are almost no checkpoints to save - afer 40 minutes of careful gameplay and tactics you get killed by ♥♥♥♥ing glitch(for example: unaware looking AI instantly turns around giving you headshot trought open door of car, which you cannot shoot trought) and you must play the whole thing again. Most of the times it takes like 15 - 20 tries, untill you make progress. It is frustrating like hell and that totally takes away rest of fun this game never had. AI spawns very vissibly out of nowhere, making impossible ambushes, killing you and your team in 2 seconds. from totally clean sector with no enemies.  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME !!!  My rating is 3/10",

Where do i start... the hour spent trying to figure out why the game wouldnt load? The fact that the most fun aspect of the game being the Ranking system is NON EXISTENT, thats right there is no ranking system or unlocking anything, everything is already unlocked and available and there are no ranks despite the fact that it clearly states on steam that there is... false advertisement right there... Controller support also doesnt seem to work, the option box is there to allow xbox controller but if you click it nothing seems to happen, i managed to get the controller to work for 3 minutes before it stopped again, i have 4 friends who all have this exact same issue... All in all, thanks steam for releasing a dumbed down ruined version of a once great game. I would attempt to retrieve a refund, but we all know thats like hitting your head against a wall.",

            "review_text": "Ubisoft had tried with Lockdown to change the direction of R6 series, with Vegas still being far from what R6 used to be, they achieved a very strong shooter in their final result, a gameplay very action oriented and the bigger flaw in Lockdown was fixed, that was the AI, Vegas manage to deliver lots of action and a few tactic, specially if played in Realistic were the health regeneration isnt issue because you die pratically with one shot for the more hardcore players.  The graphics have improved over Lockdown, the audio very good and great voice acting that make things believable around you, about gameplay, there is a new cover mechanic that give a more realistic feeling to the fights, and even that it give you a advantage over the scenery, since you are in third person view, i see that was minor issue when looking at the final result when performing intense firefights with AI.  The AI is definitly the strong point of Vegas, being in the Story mode or Terrorist Hunt, they actually present a challenge since they never do the same thing twice, they flank you, flush you out of cover or retreat if outnumbered, wich give some replayability valor to the game.  The Story is interesting with some turn overs, but isnt complete in this game (end with Vegas 2) and can be played with friend in coop mode, that is blast, about Multiplayer cant really say nothing since tough the game have interesting mechanics that can work out in multiplayer very well, i play R6 for its single and now coop feature and didnt bothered with multiplayer.  Its definitly a must have shooter, not only for fans of R6 (since they have very little in common), but for players that like FPS very action oriented and with some tactic mixed up, and now you can get it for reasonable price wich make your purchase worth while.",

Also there's something nice about a game that didn't pretend to have a story, just go here and shoot this guy in this new place. And lot's of new places it has! You start off in brown dusty Mexico, real gritty stuff but then you're like WOAH casinos! But it's all a trick, all roads lead to grey concrete structures for the last third of the game. Classic move Ubisoft, stuff the player into a bland unmemorable environment then dazzle them with lights and pizzazz then realize the budgets run out and shoot them back to a bland unmemorable environment. I’m not even mad though I remember all these characters fondly, from the overly Chinese Chinese guy to the Australian black guy and the team leader who is the whitest white guy that ever whited southern accent and all! Until R6V 2 where the accent is replaced with Batman voice.   This game is also full of lessons:   If you’re shot just wait for someone to jam a needle into your leg and you’re good to go! If your buddy doesn’t rescue you don’t worry he’ll stop the bleeding when he’s given a direct order. Even though there’s no one else around and there’s nothing left to do. Chain of command sucka.   Also you can tell who’s a real bad dude by how much gear they have on top of their gear. Spoiler the guys at the end are the baddest, they have face masks.   10/10 would die a million B.S deaths in Vegas again.  ",
