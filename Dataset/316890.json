            "review_text": "A very niche game, if you're into Noir and slower, more methodical stealth games... You may be interested in this. CHECK OUT SOME GAMEPLAY FOOTAGE beforehand though! Also wait til it's on sale. If you're a fan of moody Noir era / Detective stuff you'll probably enjoy what this has to offer thematically. The writing is definitely the highlight of the game, with seemingly simple but very challenging gameplay. It reminds me of an old NES game where you would also sluggishly hide behind dark corners, but I can't remember the title of that game... *shrug*   I advise waiting until it's on sale, I picked it up for around 10 and think it's worth that value, kinda priced a little high as far as some of the clumsy mechanics go. Some very atmospheric moments which the designer (s? it may be all a solo work) deserve credit for.   If you're willing to die (A LOT) and have the patience for a trial and error, simple interfaced game with moody environments and great writing, and definitely if you're a fan of Noir content, it touches on the genre's themes in a unique way. I would recommend this more for the content than the gameplay...",

            "review_text": "Calvino Noir lies somewhere between Mark of the Ninja for its side-scrolling, layered level structure and judgment calls of slay-or-spare under stealth, and Gunpoint, with its fedora-and-trenchcoat-clad spy/burglar. On top of these, Calvino Noir adds quite a decent bit of noir aesthetics. Voice acting is also quite good - no cringing sensation of a bad English accent or a worse German one (unlike horrors of, say, Blizzard VAs).   As the name half-suggests, there is a profusion of noir themes of solitary private eye(-ish) protagonist, constant rainfall and muted colour palette. Not sure where `Calvino` comes into play - possibly referring to the Italian author of the same name for some reference or other.  The game consists of seven levels, divided into three acts (3/2/2) and the player controls (eventually) three characters: Whit, a English `scrambler`, (whose special ability is to choke enemies), Arno (who can operate machines) and Siska (picks locks and spies through keyholes). Each character possesses some common abilities, such as handtorches, which enables the player to collect hidden piles of coins that are used to upgrade character abilities.  The gameplay is a bit of mixed bag - while straightforward in its layout and mission structure, the controls are not particularly comfortable. Abilties are keybound on Q (toggle walk/run), W (torch), E (Swap character) and they are the only keyboard-related input in the game. Navigation and interactions are bound to the mouse and this occasionally result in some difficulties like skipping cover zones while being pursuit (as the game uses checkpoints rather than saves, it might get frustrating at times). It may be different and perhaps better on a PS4, though.  A minor issue is the lack of tooltips on certain parts of the game - character upgrades, for instance, feature two abilities and although it isn`t too hard to work out what they do, it wouldn`t be too difficult to put a tooltip anyway.  Overall, it appears to be a decent, albeit perhaps a bit of niche title. Aesthetically (visual and audial) it stands out far ahead. In terms of gameplay, the aforementioned clunkiness may deter some, but in the long run these can probably be improved via devs, or simply be overcome by players.  ",

            "review_text": "Calvino Noir teases you along right from the beginning. The art is beautiful and yet so clean and simple. The game play is challenging and the story is dark and reminded me of the brutal and deceitful history presented in many war museums around Europe. Totally recommend Calvino Noir for those dark rainy nights in. Excellent Voice overs too.",

            "review_text": "The moody black and white thriller is inspired by film noir, based on exploratory and sneaking through dark and post-World War I Vienna during 1930’s.  You are taking control of four different characters during game where main character is supposed to be Wilt, written with dark poetic monologues filled with hate against city along with everyone else. Story is starting out of the sky with a single phone call where mistery lady is asking for a man with particular set of skills where Wilt jumps in with his espionage and blackmail knowledge looking for money and nothing else. As in movies, an easy mission turns into conspiracy filled with twists and turns where innocent Wilt is drawn by accident.  Now there is a slight disparity between 2D platformers and these kind of games settled in this ambient so overall immersion is lost since begining, though dark and mistery story followed by events and reveals of new characters keeps you occupied.  Through game you will discover new people and their backside stories where further into game you can make choices suited to those or only for your desire, outcome will not change but getting more info and a bit more of story behind is always interesting. Fact that your main plot character Wilt will literally dissapear after couple chapters due to slight disagreement with mystery lady “Siska” is making whole situation a bit more confusing where you can clearly feel gaping hole during progress.  Siska, young but determined lady to destroy corruption and underground criminal along with Arno, old military Wilt life-friend even though they meet in unpropriate situation comes with unique skills which will help you to make progress and get unnoticed from guards and usually only guards. As I mentioned Wilt will dissapear from game for a while so knocking out enemies is not a option anymore although eventually we get into control of moll from that same underground criminal organization which will be helpful since we can move through world without being noticed, with him ofcourse while rest of crew need to follow on their own stealth way.  Bad side comes up with frustrating feeling after dying every time along with incosistent AI where sometimes you can get killed by one shot on sight or you can simply sprint through guards despite you being noticed. Checkpoints in some bigger levels are rather few and far in between while some of mechanics doesnt work smooth as they should and it will depend on RNG factors will you succeed or not. Wilt and his knockdowns will need to be perfectly accurate in terms of when you sprint to get faster to guard since getting closer even from behind doesnt make your knockdown faster along with fact that characters will often get stuck on ladders or unexpected places. You cant go over feeling that simply this genre with this kind of gameplay is not made for stealth game and yet every new chapter will delivere nothing more then already seen.  Concept art on the other hand is more then amazing, always rainy and dark Vienna with many buildings and structures including small indoor objects deliver what they are supposed to do. Dialoguess and monologues are sometimes poetic yet still original with different accents where you can feel how natural conversation would be, well aside from repetetive sentences when you try to direct them.  Controls on PC are rather simple and they are making click and point genre from this title despite developer claiming that this is not that and its recommended to be played with controller. Problem occurs with fact that you need to control 3 different characters most of the time concurrently and that can be done only with mouse since you have enough time to choose second one while you direct your primary character at the end of the screen. There’s a lot of backtracking which makes you play same area even 3 times with really slow moving around fairly large facilities. Some of you will probably overlook these cons due to interesting and intriguing story but only if you are prepared for what is waiting you.    In my eyes it feels like that despite amazing concept art and dark noir style there are holes in gameplay and mechanics including really slow controls. If you like slow paced 2D adventures without any action whatsoever and almost repetetive levels with a bit of fresh acknowledgement after every, this might be good game for you but intentions, idea and execution are definitely not on same level.    Gameplay 6 Art Style 8 Story 6 Dialogues 6 Mechanics 5   Overall: 6.2   ",

            "review_text": "I bought the game simply because it was on sale and I have a weak spot for the noir genre. Surely it is not a very complicated game but the story is solid (until the ending) and the atmosphere build up is not bad at all. I liked the soundtrack, the visiual work and the classic noir style interventions at the starts and the endings of the each chapter.   I was eyeing this game and reading comments for a good time before I bought it so I knew what was waiting for me and didn't get my hopes high. I recommend you to do so and if you're still interested after that I guess it worths buying when it's on sale.  Sometimes it annoys you but definitely worth a try.",
