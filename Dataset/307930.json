            "review_text": "A pretty nice expansion pack/DLC although,the dinosaur choice is kind of meh because they only have ten dinosaurs and one giant turtle called archelon. The upside to the DLC is the missions, the missions were actually fun ecspecially the one where you had to rescue the dinosaurs from the military. All in all this is a great expansion pack for an awesome game (even though there isn't alot to it).",

Keep needing to restart the game and try to find a different route - it's very frustrating for what should be a fun casual game. I'm really disappointed that I spent my money on this.",
