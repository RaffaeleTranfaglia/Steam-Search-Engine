    "description": "Ghost Cleaner is a combination of arcade game and puzzle game. At first glance it is very straightforward, as you use a gun to destroy pink bricks. But the game requires you to use both strategy and tactics to finish every level. Try it once, and you'll be coming back for more!",

            "review_text": "Are you looking for a game that gives you a little Peggle mixed with some World of Goo, and more? Well then do I have the game for you. The name of the game is Ghost Cleaner and you will be tasked with conquering 101 levels of varying difficulty as you try to figure out the mastermind behind an evil plan.  Graphically this game uses a lot of light blue and pink, but that's to be expected as this is going to be the color of the objects (bricks and balls) that you're going to try to be breaking. I have to say that I like the fact that the background image changes with the area that you're entering. Here's a couple of the areas that you'll be venturing through, a hospital, a school, and a graveyard. Each level is well laid out where you feel that even the very cluttered levels look good.  As you might imagine from my description of the story I'm not 100% sure what was all going on, but the sheer number of levels and the fact that there was definitely some challenge to them kept me hooked. The reason why I compared this game to Peggle is because it's almost exactly Peggle with the difference being that the shooter is going to be different places during the levels, which creates its own set of challenges. All of the challenges I either loved or screamed at the computer because I had to actually take a strategy into the level.  I also mentioned World of Goo and the reason for this is that there are some levels where the balls or bricks are connected via strings and as you break those connections gravity takes over and it just reminds me a lot of creating the towers in World of Goo and hoping they don't fall over.  Here's the one real weakness of the game, the object of each level is to get rid of the pink blocks, each one equals a ghost, collect enough ghosts and you can use them to buy power up items. The problem is that you have no idea what each of the power ups does. You get the icon picture to work with and that's it. There's also the issue of having to click on the different selections which sometimes if you are slightly off you waste that power up on a shot that will probably not hit a damn thing. It would have been nice to switch to the power up and then back to the regular shot.  Each level has an out of three stars rating, and the way it works is the following. If you use any power ups to beat the level that's one star, if you played without power ups and left some blue on the screen that's two stars, if you clear the board that's three. Now for most of the game I didn't seem to have an issue with the amount of stars that I was being awarded until the very end where I had to go back to a previous level and beat it for three stars.  Here's the deal, this game isn't perfect, but there is something that kept me trying to defeat the levels until I got to the end, or should I say a potential end with a cliffhanger. The difficulty balance over 101 levels is quite tricky and I think it also depends on the type of player you have playing the game, so I wouldn't say there's a steady ramp up but there are a couple of puzzles that definitely stood in my way from advancing, some almost to the point of making me want to punch something. This game gets an 8.7 out of 10.",
