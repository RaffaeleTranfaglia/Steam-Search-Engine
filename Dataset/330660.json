Every planet has a unique power so there is lots of variety. I was never bored and never felt like I was solving the same puzzle twice. The snarky in-game comments are pretty great too. I found myself messing up on purpose towards the beginning just see what it would say. Hehe.  Definitely canâ€™t wait for the level editor. With the variety of powers in this game, I can see so many possibilities for some really cool levels.",

The controls are clunky and slow, and on some planets down right rage inducing and nigh unplayable.  This game looks pretty but that's about it.  Skip it, don't waste your money.",
