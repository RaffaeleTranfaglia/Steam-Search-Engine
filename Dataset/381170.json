I found it fun, not taxing on the brain, simple point and click, but be warned the UI isn't exactly friendly. It can also be a bit glitchy. I used the eye icon alot to see where I could interact with the scene, but overall I think this is a decent enough casual game, although it does feel a little like a school project.   For the couple of quid I spent I don't feel ripped off, and the time I spent playing was fun. Good as a time fiiller.  ",

Puzzles we're good, not to diffcult, didn't hurt my brain at least lol Even though using the hints a threw times the hints could of been better, most just said a little then 'try looking in diary'. Graphics arent to shabby. Good for the price.",
