            "review_text": "The Void review  Two parts to this review. I'll let you figure out which is which.   Part 1.  62 hours to finish this game via the most difficult route, although I didn't chose the most difficult route because it was the most difficult route. Nevertheless, I am one stubborn son of a ♥♥♥♥♥ even though I really, really wanted to quit the game as it felt terribly hopeless.  Sixty two hours of terror, wonder, and painfully frustrating gameplay. I couldn't even believe I made it. Yet, it's not 62 hours of game content, but 62 hours of scraping to get through and repeating the same sections over and over and readjusting for the thousandth time your strategy and inventory and if you make a mistake down the line, you might have to restart from HOURS back.  I saved my game 302 times. I must have reloaded my game AT LEAST triple that many times. In this game there is zero margin of error. Literally, very, very literally every second counts.   You literally have no time to breathe when you are not inside a chamber. The time management system is extremely flawed and frustrating. From the very second you load your game, you cannot waste a single solitary second doing anything except proceeding in exactly in the most efficient direction and having the most efficient inventory setup while spending any second in the void unpaused.   The pause system is incredibly frustrating as well. You're not just fighting the game. You're fighting the game design. I could think of many ways the system could be improved. Such as letting you see the contents of chambers without having to unpause. Allowing you to pause without having to hold down the color palette. Auto pausing on every move between chambers. Letting you view your Lympha, Heart, and Nerva levels, or give some indication of the situation without having to go to the body screen as time only moves in the void map screen. Seeing as so much of the game happens in real time, letting you view the levels you need to keep an eye constantly should be a given. Also, considering how devastating any bad move or decision can be it is absolutely madness that don't give you better ways to keep track of the situations.   The description of this game doesn't do it justice. The depth, thought, and calculation required by the player is on the level with some very demanding and serious puzzle and strategy games, even if the design is not. The most demanding aspect of this game is the logistics and that's where most of the problems occur.   Also, this game won't let you save in chambers and it seems it would be tremendously time saving and advantageous and less frustrating, repetitive and terrible to just have the game auto-save when entering a chamber and auto-save when starting a boss battle. Just why they thought that having to readjust all of your inventory any time you need to restart something would be a fun way to play the game.  It's almost impossible to make any informed decisions without wasting valuable resources and time, hence the numerous reloads as the only way to know what you have to do is to actually visit the chambers and see what's available in each one before devising your plan and then reloading to implement it from an earlier time as any wasted second is likely to mean failure.   The inventory system is extremely badly designed and time-consuming. Instead of just choosing which color your using and filling various hearts from it. You have to constantly go back to the same color and wait for it each time it fills up. After reloading and repeating this hundreds of times it has become the most hated part of this game for the simple fact that it could have been done so much easier and less time consuming.   The ideas for this game are brilliant and interesting and original, but the way they are implemented is horrible. I don't know what kind of testing they did before releasing this but seriously? A game where saving and reloading is 99% of what you do is a good idea?  Save after every move and hope that you won't have to reload again. I used guides for lots of help as there was very little information about what to do in the game and how to proceed. This game is nigh impossible without help from guides. That, to me is also a major game flaw. How can you release a game that simply requires an entirely seperate guide from other players before you have any hope of making any progress?  _________________________________   Part 2.  The story is incredibly interesting. It's dark and alien at the same time. By far one of the most immersive experiences I've ever had. I had a sense that the game was full of metaphors (or perhaps it's just my own associations) and yet the void felt like a place of it's own. The void is it's own reality. Metaphors aside, the place feels real. I don't mean each individual chamber, but the characters, the dialogue, the lore; the literature.   The Void had me mystefied as I analyzed or just wondered about the nature of it's world, it's many creatures and characters and the protaganist. It is truly strange, yet it doesn't trade the bizarre for real feeling, even if bizarre is the feeling you get from the place and situation. There is something horrible and terrifying and even beautiful about this dark place. I hardly feel like I can do it justice in that regard. Just how deep and immersive, strange and beautiful the story is.  There are elements to the story and game which remind me of ideas from the books of Carlos Castaneda. If you haven't read many of those books, then you have no idea what I'm talking about, but there's no way I'm getting into that in this review.   The Void has you making choices and also makes you feel the weight of those choices and their consequences. Once you've started on one path there is really no turning back.   The Void tells you, through various dialogue and/or narratives or just shows you, the hopelessness of the void. It's sets you to do the impossible, which is mirrored in the gameplay. I'm not sure what kind of experience I would have gotten had the gameplay been easier. The desperation for resources is a central theme and to coax that feeling in the player it is implemented in a desperate and nigh impossible journey.  Even if I liked the game, I wasn't ready for a 62 hour grind. The story and experience were definitely real in their own way. I thought it would be more explorative and less super hard work. I have to be more careful. Starting a game like this that the gameplay sucks but the core is something I can appreciate ends with me grinding away because I can't give up on the experience, story, challenge... something. Something always piques my interest or someting obsesses me and I have to see the damn thing through.  ",

            "review_text": "The Void reminds me of Star Control 2, which is one of my favorite childhood games. It is one of the more unique games I have played in quite some time. It is a fairly long and complex game that doesn't explain anything until hours in. Therefore you may need to start over mid way through because of your actions.  You are introduced as a lost soul who was dragged to a world that is nearly barren of life. Your goal is to escape The Void, which can be done in different ways. There is a set timeline and where different factions will seek to convert you to their cause. Be warned that there is a LOT of female 3d nudity but no genitals or sex.  The game revolves around a limited resource known as 'Color' in order to survive and accomplish tasks. Color is extracted by collecting flowers, planting and harvesting trees, mining rocks, catching critters, and defeating some enemies. It is initially harvested as a health that is temporarily used to boost stats like run speed. Over time it is converted into mana that is used for casting spells which is mainly used to damage enemies.  The game hides a lot of information about the use of Color until late in the game. Therefore, it may be helpful to know that casting too many spells in the same area will cause problems for you and determines what endings are available to you.",

            "review_text": "If you know what this game is (read below) and still think you'd be interested, there is literally nothing I'd recommend more than this.  The Void is pretty much unique. The visuals are striking, though the screenshots don't really do them justice. The story, once you actually know what it is, is highly ambitious and philosophical in a way very few games attempt, though I'd hesitate to recommend this purely based on that, or as a story game, because you're not really going to find a conventional narrative here -- instead it is a minimalist allegory told through hints and implications. The gameplay (often brutally and unfairly difficult) is an intriguing and original spin on resource management that, in typical Ice Pick Lodge fashion, is somewhat hampered by buggy or unfinished implementation that nonetheless manages to achieve a degree of gameplay-story integration that surpasses most games out there. It's rough around the edges, it doesn't hold your hand in anything -- gameplay or story -- and it's definitely the kind of slowburner game that you won't get into without a bit of patience, but if you don't mind that and are down to experiment with something very different, you're in for something special. It's cliche to call a game 'atmospheric', 'beautiful' or 'heartbreaking' these days, but, if you're the kind of person who wouldn't immediately hate this game to begin with, chances are you'll see how those apply to The Void more than most games they get attached to.",

The Void makes you Use different colors in your body to buff certain skills, and draw symbols to use certain attacks or to harvest things. The Void has plenty of downsides that make it hard to play though, the developers admit they made it too difficult, but mods and even console commands can make it easier. The dialogue is extremely ambiguous and cryptic, not really giving you much hints on what to do, or what the NPCs want. This especially gets frustrating when core game mechanics aren't conveyed clearly, and you don't know what the timer on your HUD means. Other than those detriments, The Void is an interesting experience with great art, an intriguing story, and sufficiently fun gameplay.",

            "review_text": "Like Ice Pick Lodge's other games, this is a very unique and hard to describe experience. It feels like an entire game of the 'nightmare worlds' from the Silent Hill games, only instead of rust and blood it's this stark, desolate, serenity. Very very much an 'arty' game and anyone expecting a straight narrative will be disappointed.  The game is divided into enjoying the weirdness and beauty, and resource management. 'Color' is the lifeblood of the game. If you run out of color you die, and you constantly consume it. 'Digested' color must be used and you must exercise crop rotation of gardens to grow more while saving up enough to feed 'sisters' (caretakers who unlock more areas) and defeat 'brothers' (hostile guardians, all of them reminiscent of SIlent Hill enemies) who will ransack your gardens. The levels are haunting, the sisters alluring, and the brothers frightening. If you want to soak in a beautiful Silent Hill-ish art experience, then scoop this up.  But their are some caveats:  Some problems is that its arty vagueness spills over into the gameplay. Tutorials are vague. Quests can be unclear. Some tutorial tips are flat out incorrect (many mechanics were never programmed in). More than half of the spells are useless and the order you get them is random, making it a huge drain on your color if you never get any of the good attack spells. Some minor stuff like the game telling you using color damages and changes levels (it doesn't), or that you'll be fine if you harvest color from gardens before a brother reaches it (they will screw up future harvests). Some major stuff like quests heavily suggesting that it will be game over if you don't bust your ♥♥♥ traveling to distant levels to defeat very tough bosses that are almost impossible at the early point you get the quest (you do not lose, nothing major happens. Do not sweat them). You WILL fail your first play attempt or two, possible after sinking 10 hours into it. I suggest looking up a guide that properly explains the mechanics.  (vague plot points that you learn in the first half hour incoming)  I enjoy stories that don't spell everything out (Lynch and Bergman are two favorite directors), but The Void doesn't explain ANYTHING. There are hint that some revelation about your life will come up. Nope. Suggestion that you have a special connection with the most far away sister and reaching her will cause something special to happen. Nope. Repeated flashbacks to an empty town where you're cashing some spirit, thinking it's a story framing device that will reveal something. Nope. Promises of hugely different endings based on which endgame condition you wish to pursue. Nope (this rivals Mass Effect 3 for disappointing color-filter ending sameness syndrome). Any kind of narrative development at all. Nope. There's probably some kind of gender statement in there about the double edged sword of male/female nature (men are providers and protectors but can be violent and brutish and restrict wonen, women are nurturers of the future but can be mercenary leeches) so it can be interpreted as both a waifu sim and patriarchy smashing affair. Whatever, nothing resolves in a cohesive manner and you'll end the game with just as much understanding as the first hour.  Come for the weird haunting art show, creepy imagery, and steel yourself for a very unsatisfying ending. I was disappointed by the ending, but keep finding myself starting up a new game every now and then to have a run at managing my color better and taking down the brothers more efficiently. Maybe The Void is a weird first person Mega Man art experience like that.",

The Void could have been a great adventure game but the neverending addition of novelty ruined it for me.",

There is nothing fun about struggling to draw glyphs with a limited amount of paint. This reminds me a lot of Black and White, where I was furiously swishing my mouse around trying to cast a miracle. No, video game developers. Don't try to make us draw things. There's nothing wrong with a keyboard and mouse. Also, the objectives aren't very clear. Boo.",
