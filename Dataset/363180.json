    "description": "Tenshu General, is a simple, elegant, Real Time Strategy (RTS) game for those who favor short play sessions over long sessions. Quick casual game play combined with the challenge of continuously adapting enemies allow for a surprisingly challenging exercise in strategy. It is a cross breed between a board game and a classic RTS.",

            "review_text": "It's not RTS. It's not even a strategy. It's  Benny Hill Simulator  in Japan setting.  Don't get me wrong, but:      This is kinda Galcon Fusion with ruined gameplay     You're limited to four armies, so get prepared to jump with these armies for hours     I'm not joking; if there's more than two enemies on the map, the battle can last forever. YES, forever!     What's the problem? the problem is, you have maximum four armies and you'll be jumping over the map with another bunch of armies (to be precise, another twelve ones if you're fighting against three generals) capturing and losing villages until after a hour of jumping you'll be lucky enough to destroy enemies capitals.     Oh, the game crashes constantly when new battle starts. To be honest, I'm writing this review just after this masterpiece crashed once again.     It's not even a game. It's a parody to a game. It's buggy, it's unsupported, it's unplayable, it's abandoned.   2 out of 10 dead Japan Generals",
