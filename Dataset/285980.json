Just points? The alien language menu system is confusing. What is going on ?!  BUT…  It's a fun game! I’ve read the negative reviews and I agree with a lot of the criticisms, but as soon as I see the scrolling pictures at the top of the page I want to jump into the game and start shooting things! Maybe it’s not worth $20, but if you grab this game on sale you will get your money’s worth. Excuse me while I go blow ♥♥♥♥ up…",

            "review_text": "Summary: I recommend this game if you like high-difficulty bullet-hell shooters or space combat games, especially at the current sale price. Not perfect, but extremely entertaining in short bursts.  I picked this up from the Humble Store after seeing that it was a 6-degrees of freedom shooter with a tron-like aesthetic. So far, pretty satisifed. It has a very minimal interface, and a graphical and art style that reminds me a bit of Rez, Geometry Wars, and (oddly) Strike Suit Zero, along with an eletronic/ambient soundtrack. There is a sparsely told story about a son getting revenge against 4 Gods who are responsible for some sort of catastrophe, the narrator is the father, reaching out to the son via his thoughts.   The control method is similar to Descent, although unlike that game series this game takes place almost entirely in open environments, rather than in cramped tunnels. It feels a little bit looser than descent, as the ship has mass and momentum, and moves more like something bound by Newtonian physics, rather than moving in the sudden, violent manner than the Descent ship did.   There are some problems and bugs. Occasionally the sound would dissolve into bizarre static, or a single note in the soundtrack would drag, as if my sound card were recieving improper commands from the game. There are some issues with collision detection and spawning. Several times, Orion (the God/Boss composed of concentric rotating rings) would spawn on top of a tower in the level, and then get 'stuck' on the geometry of the structure and jitter around. This happened several times in a row before it spawned properly again. however as the game is currently only in the 1.0 release version, I expect these will be resolved with patches fairly soon.   Stylistic notes: The HUD is extremely minimal. All it tells you is how many shields you have left, where the next objective is, and where some of the nearby enemies are. The game in general is fairly difficult, as it is a 'bullet hell' shooter. Anyone playing this should expect it to be fairly challenging. Each level gets progressively more difficult , until eventually the screen is full of enemies and bullets almost all the time. Sometimes this can get tiring or exhausting, so I recommend just playing the game in short bursts.   If you are a fan of tron-style games, space shooters, or any combination thereof, I think you should pick it up.",

            "review_text": "Awesome game! Complete control over all axes of movement and rotation feels very nice. The gameplay is intense and crowded, but it is also possible to explore and find secrets at calmer times. There is some incentive to play the game more than once.",

            "review_text": "I have had this game since the first day it appeared on Steam and never once have I been disappointed in the way it plays, sure the game is hard but not...impossible and Kromaia does have an enormous amount of replayability. Graphics are amazing (retro styled) and sound is good to excellent. I like the breathtaking speed which you can extract out of the game and there is so much going on both onscreen and offscreen (all angles are catered for) and when things get hectic, you sometimes have to run like hell to stay out of trouble. This game needs a dedicated group for those who treasure and love this game and the game seriously needs some DLC for more levels. I am not asking for a sequel as Kromaia is an amazing stand-alone title that has risen above all other 6DOF games to become a classic. I wish more people knew about Kromaia but sometimes word of mouth is the best marketing tool and as with all classic games which mature Kromaia will become legendary. Worth every penny. Verdict - must buy! - 11/10 - unmissable. This review is a tribute to both the game and the amazing developers. 'nuff said.",

            "review_text": "FIRST IMPRESSION  Kromaia sets out to do something great but hits some barriers early on.  Visuals: The game's visual style is simple and good to look at in the beginning, but the screen quickly becomes cluttered with junk and debris within the first few minutes. This chaos quickly translates into a frustrating game of junk-dodging and eventual disorentiation. If you manage to recover your bearings, you can quickly speed off into the next choatic encounter.  Gameplay: The controls are clunky at first and there is a fairly unforgiving learning curve. I'm still not there yet, but I'm sure with time I'll eventually get the hang of it and expertly speed off to my death with ease.  Story: The game focuses more on gameplay than story. If there is a story, I have a feeling it won't be an incredibly deep or engaging.  Overall: If you're looking for a quick and easy space adventure, look elsewhere. This game's controls take some time to learn and you'll have to master them to move forward. The game quickly becomes chaotic and is a great challenge for someone looking to master flying and shooting your way to victory.",
