The more important thing is that the game teaches you what to do if you find yourself in a situation where a guy isn't breathing, etc. I doubt I will need this in real life but who knows.. Better to be prepared, right?",

            "review_text": "I really wanted to like this game, really. It's a great game and all, but the hacking in this game. It barely even works, and the AI explains it horribly, and it gets really repetitive after trying it for the 4th time, because of failing the other times because even though you have it perfectly lined up, it turns red and doesn't count you having both circles in the square. The art of the game looks as if it was ripped directly from a Borderlands game. I'm not sure if this is a bug or not, but when you call the woman at the start using the AI, there is no audio. And the game is really lacking sounds, a huge storm is happening directly outside the glass and you can't hear it at all?! Kind of stupid.   Pros",
