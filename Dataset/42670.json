Not as good though, however it is still a good addition to the genre and the use of time altering mechanics is very interesting. It's heavily scripted though and every level has tons of health packs and ammo scattered around - no a fan of that. Also, it feels as if the devs used Google translate for all the Russian in this game. The story was interesting at first, but by the time you get to the end and try to understand the whole plot, you'll remember Bruce Willis from that diner scene in 'Looper'. It's one of those time travelling stories where they make you intentionally confused. You went back in time because your future self made you go back in time - talking about a loop hole.

The game is almost shamelessly derivative, taking the both the style and character building of BioShock, the gravity gun from Half-Life 2, and throwing in a few nods to F.E.A.R. However, this mish-mash of other games' ideas is by no means a bad thing. If anything, Singularity manages to almost play as a 'best of' collection of FPS trappings, the ultimate compilation of cool gimmicks and toys seen in the genre over the past five years.",

Pros: -You shoot thingies with your badass guns. -Cool ideas with time warping (that's a pro) but instead of shooting thingies with it, it's given as a gimmick to solve some really ♥♥♥♥ing stupid puzzles. (that's a con) -Good atmosphere and graphics. -Hilariously bad Russian translations -Good guns for every taste. -Lots of gore and death animations -Non-scripted leaping attacks by zombie enemies that are not QTES and you actually have to aim to push them off (Wow they just don't make that anymore) -Shoot off hands and legs of the enemies and actually feel satisfied. -Multiplayer is really fun but dead, sadly. -Manipulate time with a deployable force field and shoot bullets, throw knives (or whatever you've got there) at your enemies and laugh at their faces when the time flows again. -You can get creative with your kills or play as you want. -There's this boss fight.  Cons: -Not enough thingies to shoot sometimes. -Too easy even on hard difficulty. -Story is bad. (or mediocre at best) -Some perks are out of place, costs too much or either totally useless (Why not give them outright?) -Really stupid puzzles that are too easy, why puzzles instead of more thingies to shoot? -Short (Thanks to stupid puzzles.) -Final level is a dissapointment -ONLY 2 NINJA ZOMBIE FIGHTS? FOR REAL?????? They should be regular enemies. -Really low replayability(Though i played it 2 times, but that's just me), pretty linear. Also illusion of choice  This game just cries for overhaul, but all in all, Raven software delivered a pretty decent shooter with a twist, like always. I'll give it a 7",

Might even be a better deal at Xmas sale but needed a new game to play now and it fit the bill. Can only carry 2 weapons which is a change compared to carrying everything there is and does add a challenge that way also need to watch ammo use which is nice. Will do an update further on in gameplay but good so far. Definitely worth the $8.50 I paid on sale. Played om Easy mode for 1st play to learn the game. Next game I step it up. I wil probably play it 4 times over the next few years so great value.",

Half-Life meets Bioshock meets Timesplitters: Future Perfect meets F.E.A.R meets C&amp;C Red Alert meets Wolfenstein meets Timeshift meets Lost. The result isn't terribly original, but it's amazingly fun.  The game constantly surprises with a change in gameplay and mood every 15 minutes. Unlike Duke Nukem Forever, it actually does a good job of blending 'old skool' gameplay with modern game design.  Pro tip 1: weapon lockers allow you to swap weapons, not just upgrade them. Pro tip 2: the upgrades for the 'Deadlock' time-freezing bubble are incredibly overpowered and yet suprisingly cheap, so unless you want to make the game very easy, don't upgrade Deadlock, or at most only upgrade it once. Pro tip 3: if you have Windows 7 and the audio seems quiet, one solution is to Alt Tab out of the game, go into your volume controls, find the entry for SIngularity and boost the volulme.",

Biggest flaw is the lack of FOV slider, but that can be fixed by installing FlawlessWidescreen.  If you can pick it up for 5€ on a sale, go ahead, you won't regret it.",

The game is a good length, has a solid story, a hand-full of strong characters and a nice variety of combat. The game undoubtedly feels like a side project but a finished one! It might not have the detail and love that one would expect in a CoD game, but I was impressed with Activision's ability to begin and end a story with the time that was given.  The game takes many ques from other games. While Singularity might not bring anything new to the table, it does bring a well blended action fps for any gamer to enjoy. Nothing is taken too far with this game. There is a good number of different enemy types, but not so many that the player isn't able to learn how to combat them before the game is over. Also, there are at least ten weapons to choose from -- most of which can be upgraded and changed out at weapon stations.  The 'TMD' device that the player is given adds a shocking amount of combat options. The different uses of weapons and 'TMD' abilities with the added upgrading and leveling system could make for another good play-though -- maybe two. Unfortunately, the fights are scripted, and that takes a bit from the replays.  Over all, the game gets a good review because it feels 'humble.' It isn't a ground breaking or epic title, and it does not try to be. The game gives the player a gripping intro, good progression and good old fashioned boss fights!   Note: $30 would have been spot on the day this game came out. Best bought on sale now.         Singularity&nbsp;",

This game is little bit like Bioshock, but more enjoyable and darker. I'm not a huge fan of horror games (this is not a horror game), but this game still gave me some horror which is rare for me. Even that it's short, it's a masterpiece. My recommendation is to buy it in sale, like I bought in a big sale of bunch of games from Activision, and I could say this was the first one I completed since it wasn't too hard to understand and most enjoyable from the start!  tl;dr Pros: - Awesome detailing + graphics - Good story - Well designed weapons - Unique - Dark feeling, epic feeling and taking it with you. - SHOW IT TO YOUR FRIENDS! Like I did when my friend visited me, he liked it so much as well. And your friend can help you at puzzles.  Cons: - Short, this is why you should but in on a sale - uhm ye, I played this a while ago, but I can't rly think any other cons. Propably going to play it again someday.",

The wrist device mechanic was very fun and I liked being shifted back and forth between pre and post-disaster time periods. It was like switching between a horror and a general action atmosphere.

One thing that really made me impresed and I Wont give any specific spoilers, but to date its the only game i have ever played that doesent have the player killed betrayed, or arbitrarally punished by karma for choosing the evil ending }:)&gt;",

Although you breeze through it in 5 hours and it's not very hard (unbalanced even - if you use the time slowdown sphere and some tmp upgrades you can just run through most parts). It starts off quite weak but once you get a hold of the TMP it gets really good. The story is rather straightforward but I have to say that I really enjoyed it and it was refreshing to play a linear FPS that was this entertaining.  Singularity really resembles half life in quite a few ways and it is really good in teaching you the mechanics. The controls are also really intuitive/good (except the default bind for healing)   my issues: One note on mechanical side - I lost a lot of E99 money because in tmp you actually have to equip something to the slot. I missed that and treated it as other upgrades so I had a ton of upgrades for tmp that did not work and I spent the currency for.  The lore is expanded via notes and tapes but there could be more of the 'show, don't tell' visual narrative.  Overall it seemed like there was more potential than what the game showed and the puzzles could include more variations (i,e, you need to use the grenade launcher exactly once and then forget about it, modifying time in later sections is mostly used for opening boxes and restoring tape recorders compared to strong first half where it was used for various objects, turning soldiers into husks was fun but rather inefficient shortly after it was introduced etc).",

A great selection of unique and fun weapons that all have weight to them (dat sniper rifle), a great gore/gib system, frantic combat with competent AI, a half way decent story, and unique time bending abilites that give you the edge you need in combat. Words can't describe how fun it is to put a squad of 4 or more enemies into a stasis bubble, walking into the bubble, taking aim and firing a bullet right between each enemies eyes, then collapsing the bubble and watching all 4 mean go flying backwards as their brains leak out the back of their foreheads. Or dropping a grenade at their feet and watching them explode inside the stasis bubble in super slow motion. Good times. And in the end game, when you get your final upgrade, you're literally a god amongst men.   This game represents what Activision COULD have given us- fun, unique, and well designed shooters, that encouraged fun over realism, weapons that all had unique functions instead of 'This rifle shoots really fast, this one shoots in 3 round bursts, and this one fire slowly but deal lots of damage.'

Dark, somewhat creepy, with monsters that did catch me off guard a few times, was a good, solid game. Storywise, leaves a little to be desired, with what I think is a clunky ending, but with three possible endings, allows you to think back through the story a few times to make your decision. Good game, a little under rated.",

I played through it in 3 days. It is one of my favorite games I've ever played. It had pretty good graphics, good combat, and good AI. But most of all the story line was incredible. It almost makes me upset with Bioshock Infinite because when you play Singularity, it almost seems as though Bishock took a lot of ideas from this game. For such a great game, I'm surprised it isn't more popular. This game is under 10 bucks, but is worth any 40 dollard game out there. Buy this game and you won't be dissapointed.",

Visuals : The visuals in the game wont destroy your graphics card or anything but it does tax it a little bit. The scenery and set pieces look very nice, sometimes really pretty. There is no reuse of areas that I can tell ( aka same corridor syndrome ) and you will get a good feeling of progression ( you can visually see getting closer to your goal). The enemies look nice but dont change much in the looks area but at least you dont get the same guy but his time hes red! Overall - Good looking game that helps to visually immerse you into the world.  Story and Setting : (Spoiler Free) The setting is an Island off the coast of Russia that has some dirty little secrets and as a US special forces soldier you have to infiltrate the island and find out what is going on. As a base story it is just like most of the other FPS games out there but Singularity adds a nice twist on the basic formula that makes it feel new and refreshing. Overall - The story wont break the bank on amazing plots but it will engage you very well and help to keep you playing to find out what happens next.  Gameplay : This is were the game really sets itself above a normal FPS. It has a slight rpg feel with upgradeable weapons and skill selecting although neither is a game changer or breaker. It has good gun play and the powers that you use are fun and work well but what this game does really well is that it lets you play the way you want to. No, there is no stealth or anything like that, it is all action and if something is in your way it has to die but the game gives you incredible freedom on how it dies. You can play and complete this entire game with nothing but guns or once you get your powers you can complete the entire game with those. It never limits you and it gives you plenty of ammo or easily throwable items no matter which way you want to play. Overall - The gameplay is great and gives you a great feel of freedom that never tells you how you should play it   Replayability : While the story does give this game a little bit of replay ( you might want to play again just to see all the clues you didnt understand in the first playthrough ) and the gameplay lets you play it again in differnet ways, there is really no reason to play it more than a few times.  Personal overall enjoyment - This game was a good change of pace to me for normal FPS's. I enjoyed playing the game and was glad of the purchase I made. I will probably play it again sometime down the line and have no problem recommending it as a good game.",

For starters the game is a measly 5 hours long with little replay value. Yes the game dose have multiple endings but the game saves your progress right before your chose what ending you will get. My next problem is the difficulty. The game in my opinion was way to easy. The tmd made combat interesting but it also made you unstoppable. And the amount of medkits you get are insane. there were many times where i would pass up on 5 in one room because i was maxed out. I only died once and stood there and let 5 monsters chomp on me while i spun around. The few bosses that are there honestly just feel like normal enemies with giant ♥♥♥♥ me blisters on them. The only thing that stuck out in my mind was the weapon selection. you have your basics like a revolver, assault rifle, shotgun, and sniper rifle. But then you start getting guns like the spikeshot that is a railgun with a delay or a grenade launcher that has grenades that you can move on your own. However you are limited to two guns that you can carry except for super weapons. I went through most of the game with the assault rife as my primary for most of the game. and if the is a situation where you can use a gun to its fullest there is convinently a dead body with on laying right in front of you. The super weapons bring the most flavor to the table. The seeker fires an explosive round that you can control in a cool bullet time scene. And then there is a rocket launcher. Ok they may have run out of ideas at that point. The game is fun however and if you looking to kill some time (no pun intended) i recommend picking this game up only on a sale though.",

Longer version: Like others say, mishmash of a few things from other games, some work well others are meh, some controls counter intuitive tell mid/late game. Got only a few slow repsonses from the game(might be my pc, its not lastest or greatest), but no crashing for me. Mostly run and gun, with some RPG elements, story is decent nothing award winning but it gets you through and makes you think about timeline(s) stuff. Endings(YES there are 3 different endings) are decent enough too. Overall, the 2 worst things were the no sub titles, the dialoge is bit quiet, and how short it was.   In the end, a recomend while under 15ish bucks. At that point, you will be able to fell like you got your money's worth.",

            "review_text": "Alternative history games I feel generally fall into two categories; absurdly grim alterno-dramas that take themselves too serviously, and the nonsensical cheese fests that know its a silly parody. Its a premise that can go both ways in quality. Singularity treads a good balance in melodrama and campiness, and offers up a decent shooter.  Story is your standard Cold War 'what would happened if'. 1950's Russians discover an all powerful, time distorting element E99 (not to be confused with Einsteinium) on a remote island, experiments go horribly wrong and left to stew for fifty years, and a botched American black ops mission changes the timeline and basically gives Russia the world, and you have to jump back and forth to fix the present/future. There have been better plots in games, but this isn't a totally laughable B movie. It is forunate that the games atmosphere saves it from B movie hilarity. Being trapped inside a decaying, direlict research complex greatly enhances the overall mood and plot of Singulariy, adding a mounting sense of dread and horror that; at least for me, was almost too much to handle.  Singularity's gameplay is pretty competent; starting off as your traditional FPS with generous doses of action survivor horror thrown in for good measure. It shortly becomes what I can only discribe as a 50's sci fi shooter with the introduction of the Time Manipulation Device, a powerful wristband that let you age and revert certain objects and enemies at will, it is perhaps not as solid as Half Life's Gravity Gun. But its still pretty fun. The guns you find throughout are varied and not half bad, but as you find your formula to fight Mutants and Russian soldiers, you'll find yourself using and upgrading only a combination of three or four for everything. Finally there is a lot of variety to them, some of them are not the smartest AI's I've seen; But some, like the mutants that shift in and out of the material world, are unnervingly tough to deal with.  Singularity is a little rough around the edges, but at the end of day its a very satisifing shooter. It does a worthly job of blending its story, atmosphere and game mechanics into something I found memorable and be more willing to replay some day. And in an Era of throw away military shooters, that is saying something.",

The good The story is extremely well done, with excellent voice acting and animation. Combat is fluid and frantic but is not constant nor does it swamp all other aspects of the game. There are plenty of moments to just look around and feel the atmosphere of the game which really allows for deep immersion. The slower moments in the game are dotted with some very good and logical puzzles that you must solve to advance or solve to reach a hidden area. The absolute best part of the game is the blend of visual and audio aspects to put you into the most tense condition that I can recall while playing any game. Though it does have the thrice cursed 'Boss Monsters' It includes them in such a fluid manner and rather than just throwing you into an arena with a monster that you have no clue what the 'super secret' way to defeat it could be, you are given hints along the way that alllow you to make quick tactical assessments and fight the creatures without wasting your time or ammo searching for the special spots to poke at. Bravo design team!! This is the only game that I actually enjoyed fighting the boss monsters. Not that is was easy.  now the bad; The number one most terrible thing about this game is that it is absolutley too short, in 19 hours I finished it twice. granted I tend to finish game more quickly than most, but with a story this good I would have loved to stay in it a while longer. There are a few places that the collision actually blocks the path you are suppsed to follow in such a way as to make you think it is another invisible wall. Here i would like to note that I HATE invisible walls!! When you make a barrier it should look like a barrier not like an open path that might lead to a hidden area. The controls suffer from being ported over from a game deck so they do not really mesh well with keyboard and mouse but it is not too bad and you can remap them to more fit you preferences which helps a lot. There are several places in the tutorial section of the game that gloss over some things that you really need to know so it's very easy to miss which makes using the equipment later in game more difficult than it should.  Over all this is a beautiful gem of a game that I think anyone who is a fan of tense and dark gameplay should absolutely pick up, and tell their friends",

Let’s start with the positives: some of the weapons, like the Seeker and the Dethex Launcher, offer some creative opportunities in combat, and combined with the TMD, combat gameplay almost never becomes a chore, which is good since it’s pretty much 95% of the game.  That’s where the positives end, though: the game lacks any creative thought outside of combat. For example, the TMD is a pretty see-through attempt at combining the Plasmids from BioShock and the Gravity Gun from Half-Life 2, with a gimmick that just adds one extra button press to crate-stacking sequences. The art design feels like a poorly made Soviet AU of Rapture, and the voice acting makes Hollywood Russian accents sound genuine.  The plot is the worst part of the game: I understand, time travel isn’t exactly an easy trope to work with. But even taking that into account, the story is horrendously full of plot holes, and is little more than a barely-connected series of events to get you from setpiece A to setpiece B through combat arena C.  Overall, I’d say: if you happen to own the game, give it a spin to play around with the combat mechanics, but don’t bother throwing away any money on it if you want a satisfying game experience.",

The ability to selective age objects, create time warp felds, slow down time when scoping, and use telekinesis opened up a lot of cool gameplay doors. These aren't, perhaps, new features - other games have tried it out before. But this game makes an effort to let you interact with tons of environmental objects, which is nice - it turned an otherwise standard shooter experience into something that felt pretty interactive.  But the game's flaws outrank the fun. In order to get the sound to work, you need to disable any recording devices in Windows. The sensitivity bar won't allow you to go lower than a certain amount (which is still way too high), so instead of trying to find a config file, I just halved the DPI on my mouse. The FOV is artifically low (we're talking probably 65, here) so you get a claustrophobic sense of the world.  I might have been able to forgive these shortcomings (and I did, for a few hours), but the real killer was the unbalanced gameplay. I handled giant mutants, blinking mutants, hordes of russians, and twisted undead with no problem. But at a specific point in the game, you're placed into the position of dealing with enemies who kill you in 2-3 shots, and which you're unable to really fight back against. The swarm of suicide bugs who, with three different hits, will kill you. The blade-armed assassin mutant who could take a literal dozen sniper shots to the head (!!) without being visibly damaged. These encounters took about half an hour to get past (a long time to spend in one encounter), with lots of frustration. And worst, they're surrounded by other no-problem encounters. I had thought to crank down the difficulty and cheese my way through these speedbumps, but you can't even do that.  Add that to the game's general low-res appearance, uninteresting environments (someone said it was all brown - that's true), and unsatisfying sound; and the result was that I simply couldn't find a reason to continue playing.",

One detail - 'You Are Empty' came out in 2007. Hmm. Funny, that.  Anyway, though 'You are Empty' feels like a game created by a small indie studio, the super-Soviet world they created felt more authentic than the one in Singularity, created by big studio Raven Software.  I am still playing it, but my biggest pet peeve so far is when they have English text with silly things like backwards 'R's, I suppose to make it seem Russian.  Anyway, the gameplay is reasonable, though not particularly inspired, so if you get it cheap enough, and you aren't expecting much, you should have some fun.

The game's big gimmick, the TMD, is nothing more than a contextual extra 'use' key. While it has other abilities to use against enemies, none of them I encountered were entirely necessary to use. This is mostly because the game's assault rifle is the greatest weapon ever created in the history gaming. With plentiful ammo, high accuracy, low recoil, and able to take out most common enemies with one headshot, there is no real reason to use any other weapon. It's effectiveness causes the novelty of the games 'unique' weapons to wear off very fast. Sure, you can use the gun that allows you to guide bullets into enemies around cover, or slightly out of your line of sight. But in the time it takes for you to guide that bullet into a single enemy, you can kill that same enemy and his 5 comrades, and the rest of his reinforcements in the same amount of time with that godlike assault rifle. There is nothing else to the gunplay, just shoot them in the face with the AR and gg. You can't even throw grenades. You'll find more depth in a CoD game, which is an impressive feat I must admit.  Beyond the boring gunplay there is not much else of merit. The story suffers the same logical inconsistencies of any story involving time travel. My favorite part was going back in time to stop the evil Russian general from killing the good scientist, and after bursting into the room, unloading 10+ bullets into his face and blasting him through the window several stories above the ground, he ends up surviving and going on to rule the world. ♥♥♥♥in Russians man. The characters are dull cliches ripped off from other, better games. The evil general, the good scientist, and the random woman helping you are basically the Russian copies of Dr. Breen, Dr. Kleiner, and Alyx from HL2. There's also the incredibly generic soldier buddy that you'll find by the dozens in any CoD game. You spend about the first 30 minutes of the game with him until he gets shot in the face by the general because he's a stupid ♥♥♥♥ing moron. This of course is after you get randomly sent back in time and accidentally save the general because you're a stupid ♥♥♥♥ing moron as well. The only interesting attribute of any of them was the well modelled ♥♥♥ of the woman, but I digress...  Overall, Singularity is an incredibly bland shooter with some well conceptualized yet poorly executed ideas. If you absolutely must try it however, or you think I'm full of ♥♥♥♥, at the very least wait to buy it when it's on sale for $5 or less.",
