            "review_text": "Why doesn't Steam have a 'neutral' voting option? This game has points going for it and then it has also quite a few against it. Overall I really can't say that I disliked it, but that's about as positive as I feel about it.  The presentation is good. The graphics are colourful and well done, the animations are awkward as in most hidden object games, the music is nice and the voice acting isn't awful. Some locations feel 'shoehorned' into the Tibetian setting though, but overall it doesn't break the immersion.  There are quite a few hidden object scenes, so if you like those this game is definately for you. The inventory puzzles are rather weak with quite a few feeling really forced. A few examples: You have a magical staff that can shoot fire, but in order to melt some block of ice you have to use a magnifying glass. There is a huge lizard blocking your way and you have a bucket full of sleeping potion, but you rather use the bucket of sleeping potion on the ground under a spider in order to make the spider fall asleep. You need to put a lantern next to a rock and use a flint to light it up even if there are lit candles very near. The list goes on and it really gets on your nerves after a while. The minigames aren't bad, but they are either really easy (match the shape/colour) or quite difficult.  Overall the game offers a couple of hours of hidden object game play, but if you are more into casual adventures that make at least some sense then this game might disappoint you. Certainly one of the weaker Artifex Mundi games and I can only recommend it in a sale or a bundle.",

            "review_text": "This is a weak Artifex Mundi HOG. Yes, it has a female protagonist. Yes, it has a glowy-eyed baddie. Yes, it has the usual puzzles.  I was very excited when I first heard about this before the release. Artifex Mundi usually provides decent, detailed environments and nice enough atmosphere. That + Tibet = winner. Unfortunately, that is not the case.   The game is bland, the story pretty much predictable. Granted, many HOGs are like that. On top of that, this one feels... empty. There are next to no NPCs. That wouldn't be a problem, if the surroundings supported that 'all alone in a forgotten world' atmosphere. This feels and looks like everybody just popped out of the dorm to see the UEFA Cup final and you're the only sad loser who doesn't like footie.  When it comes to the Tibet part, the game will let you down. It's as if the devs have looked at exactly 3 pictures of Tibet, extrapolated and cut-and-pasted the rest from old games. The phrase 'winging it' comes to mind.   Aside from issues with plot, atmosphere and immersion, this one suffers from annoying (but not game-breaking!) glitches/problems. The clicks don't always register. There are HOS that have two or more same/similar items with only one correct (spoiler:   my fave is the one where you have a living butterfly about 40 pixels above a butterfly brooch with the clue 'Butterfly'. The insect is not the correct answer.  ). The hint is 'not ready yet' despite me having never used it before in my 100 minutes of playing.   The same goes for puzzle logic and variety. I think I've found and used about six different axes and pulled another half a dozen stuck objects out from wherever. Sometimes you can break the ice, sometimes you have to melt it, oh wait -- *this* time you can't use the Staff of Melting in your inventory! Not impressed.  Is this the worst thing ever? No, absolutely not. But only get this if you have played all the other AM HOGs (even the Time Mysteries!) and can get the game for next to nothing.",

            "review_text": "I only recommend this because if you're looking for an HOG there are not many out there. Puzzles are relatively easy but they feel rewarding to complete. The aesthetic is nice for the most part. The facial animation seems to be a 2D recording tacked to a 3D model, kinda spooky. That alone made me think it was a really old game but it was actually released this year! But what do animations matter, you're here for the puzzles.",
