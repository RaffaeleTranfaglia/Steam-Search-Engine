            "review_text": "BIG UPDATE 6/17/2016:  Some idiot at the company decided to upgrade the menu to a sloppy, Valu-soft menu from 1997. If you don't care that the menu is ugly and looks like it was meant for a 640X480 screen, it is now a total pain in the butt to navigate. Before, the tables you owned were separate from the tables you can try and then buy. This was very helpful because there are so many tables to choose from, and being able to click a link to get to your paid content was a time saver. Now every table is jumbled together, and you have to strain your eyes trying to read crappy font and blurry graphics to get to the stuff you paid for. There is no way to sort out your tables. Even if you buy a season pack of tables, and click on the link for your tables by season, you still go to the same screen with all of the tables.  They have also added a new, ugly overlay during gameplay that you have to make sure you get rid of since it adds nothing, but takes away screen space for gray, fuzzy graphics. Remember when the game just told you what ball you were on? Well, now there are stretched .jpgs of a pinball that are of a much lower quality of the table your playing to look at! The best part is that they're not at the sides of the screen either, but at the bottom, making sure that actual table space is being used for useless, ugly graphics.  Oh, and the Star Trek game still isn't fixed.  Essentially, if you want to buy all of the season packs and get all of the tables, this is one of, if not the most, expensive game on steam. You will spend about $100 bucks to get everything, but you won't because many tables are boring on a computer. If you want to buy tables individually, now you're penalized trying to navigate the laziest, ugliest, and most useless menu I have seen since the 90's, and I'm not exaggerating. The graphics, navigation, and color scheme are OLD, and I have no idea why you would update to something so pathetic, and expect to clear $30 to $100 per customer.   When you add in that the game is almost 13gb in size, no joke, this makes Pinball Arcade the stupidest decision you can make by downloading it. Civilization V is 9gb and Gothic 3 is 4gb, and those two games together are the same size as a pinball game? LLLAAAAAAAAAZZZZZZZZZYYYYYY!!!! You have to download every, single pinball machine because they're too lazy to set up a link where you can download the free trial of a machine that looks interesting to you. You're wasting gb's of hard drive space on tables you aren't interested in because the creators are lazy.  Did I mention the Star Trek game is still broken?  Save your money, save your HD space, save your time, and save your eyes, and forget The Pinball Arcade.   OLD REVIEW:  Most of the tables are fine, however most people want to play the Star Trek table, and it's still broken. Everytime I play that table, once I hit over 200 million, there are no more pinballs for me to play with. All you do is hear the music, watch the probes move back and forth, and nothing happens. You can 'call an attendant,' but since no ball is visably stuck on the screen, you're screwed. It's a shame that if you do well on a very popular table, all of your success is wiped out on a glitch.  This problem has been around for years with this table, and other tables if you check around, and I thought someone at Williams ( or whoever is in charge of software quality control ) would try to fix the problem by now. Unfortunately, paying customers have no value once we've paid. Stay away until someone at this company actually starts caring about paying customers.",

            "review_text": "Don't mind my hours because I've played a ton of Pinball Arcade. I first fell in love with it on the Playstation 3 and eventually moved to the Steam version, which I like much more. I highly recommend getting the season packages. In fact, this is put out by a fairly small outfit with a lot of dedication and passion for pinball, so I pay extra for the pro pack to help support them. I don't even mess with the extra stuff that comes with the pro, except maybe ball skins. They're just worth it.  If you don't know, buying a past season gives you all the games from that season, since they've already released. Your game (Pinball Arcade) updates a few minutes after your purchase, so there isn't an install, unless things have changed since I bought one last. If you buy the current season, there may only be a few games but be patient. Similar to a current season of TV episodes, the games are still being released and you'll get them as they come until the purchased season is over. It gives you something to look forward to!  As an 80s kid, I didn't have money for plunking into pinball or arcade machines. I was one of those who would stand around and watch others play, just to feel the excitement. My father worked in a factory and would sometimes bring home an actual pinball that popped out of a big machine on occasion. I settled for rolling that around on the floor (sad, I know!)  But now, I have more than I could ever dream at my fingertips! And they're so realistic! Farsight takes the actual tables and dissects them, ensuring we get as authentic an experience as possible besides playing the real thing. And while owning real pinball machines sounds great, think of the upkeep and expense, not to mention the room you'd need. It's a romantic thought, but this is way better.  I have a number of pinball video games, but there are two that rule supreme for me: Pinball FX2 (Zen) and Pinball Arcade. I love Zen Pinball for the fantasy angle. They make excellent tables that never existed so anything is possible, especially with Marvel and Star Wars! But when I want to play something that was actually crafted and made the rounds back when I was wishing I could play, that's when Pinball Arcade comes through for me.  I play using a Logitech Gamepad F310, by the way, and it works great!  This is my first time actually sitting down and writing a review here (I think), so I hope it was worth a poop.",

Their team completely ignores requests for features they have been receiving for, literally, years... they continue to introduce new bugs to their pinball table packs, and have introduced a new user interface that is so unpopular their overall ratings have dropped from 73% to 44% over the last 30 days (as of the last time I checked).    I won't go into detail on these issues as they are already clearly documented in their user discussions... my intent is to let other consumers know how bad my experience has been buying from this company so that other people can make an informed decision about their purchases. I can assure any interested parties that this developer will not communicate any plan for improvement, bug fixes or for future update timelines, etc etc... they are only interested in selling new content on a monthly basis without any regard for quality or consumer satisfaction whatsoever.  I am lucky enough to have been eligible for refunds on most of the Pinball Arcade content I have purchased.  Thank you for reading...

            "review_text": "O.K. I've played enough of this game to get a general impression of the quality. I had downloaded it years ago but thought the price of the packs were too high so I uninstalled it. I recently got an urge to play pinball so I purchased Pinball FX2 as it was cheaper and had good reviews. While Pinball FX2 is a good game (I bought about eight tables), I found it a bit gimmicky. I had only played the free Arabian table on Pinball Arcade and thought it was O.K. but it wasn't enough to convince me to spend the bucks to buy a pack. But I did some research and read some reviews and in the end I took the plunge and bought Season Pack One. Boy am I glad I did because it is really good. The authenticity of the tables I find amazing and it has to be as close to playing the real classic pinball tables on a pc as you can get. I found Pinball FX2 to be more flash over substance where as Pinball Arcade is more of a passion of love. I read some reviews complaining about a 'delay' in the flippers but that is all part of the authenticity. On the old pinball machines it was all mechanical so it would seem like a 'delay' anyway because of the moving parts.  As for the price, for the £22.99 or so I paid for pack one, I got about 21 tables so that works out at about a pound per table which is very good value for money. The price may seem high but it is totally worth it. A single table on Pinball FX2 starts at about £1.99 so it is a no-brainer.  I'm just pretty amazed by the realism of the tables - very impressive !  Edit (4/5/2016)  After some more game time I am updating my review. I have now tried out a lot of the tables on Pinball Arcade and whilst they are still very good, my only gripe is that they seem to all be retro tables. I wish there were more modern tables but all the tables seem to be pre-1980's. Anyway, I played Pinball FX2 some more and found a table view I liked and after playing it some more I found it to be more enjoyable than previously thought and not so gimmicky.  So my final conlusion is if you want a retro and realistic pinball simulator with lots of classic tables, than Pinball Arcade is the one to go for, but if you want modern mechanics and tables, then Pinball FX2 is the one to go for.",

            "review_text": "This is the best pinball game available for professionals, amateurs and just casual couch play. It is outright pinball fun. If you love the game for any reason, this product is fantastic. Grab the free version and play the free content. There's a free table every month and a few free ones included permanently. Pricing is fair, however, as I mention later, the bundling structure leaves a little bit to be desired.  While you cannot substitute the feel of the real machine, you can substitute the strategy involved in playing the games and learning the rules. For tournament players, I can't imagine anything better shy of having to purchase the real tables in order to practice setups. Since this game uses real emulation, all the rules apply as they do on the real tables, therefore developing habits in your gameplay here will translate into the final game. However, only general habits towards the rules of the game.  I never got a chance to play Star Trek: TNG until recently at a Pizza Pub, after I had been playing it for a long time on Pinball Arcade. I was super stoked to find a real table of it. First game on the machine lasted 40 minutes, I scored 4.8billion points and ran through Final Frontier twice. The WHOLE time I was in control and my shots were planned ahead. On a table I'd never played...or did I? My normal first attempt at a new pinball game is flailing my elbows and knees until I slip and hit my chin on the corner and double drain.  Do you transfer the real timing between the digital game and the real table? No. You do not. But did you also know that you don't transfer the timing between the real table and another real table? Some people may think if you return to a real table that you will have developed bad habits digitally or unwisely rely on makeable shots that aren't so much in the real world. This is all true, but real pinball players just know how the real thing is and this disconnect remains a soft barrier as we're not actually the kind of person who truly assumes the digital version WILL replace the real thing in every way. I can't wait until the mode in Pinball Arcade where you gotta scrape out a couple decade old hornet nets.  Timings and tricks are different digitally, that's a certainty, but they're still there because the developers know of them and put them in. Separating yourself from this disconnect between reality and gaming is important in a product like this and if you're one of those people that can do this, you will enjoy this experience a high percentage of the amount you would the real table. If you're one of those people that ♥♥♥♥♥es that the movie sucks compared to the book, then you'll probably have the same knee-jerk reaction. If you really love pinball and you don't own real machines, you have no real other choice if you want to play the real games.  There are some things I'm not fond of:  One thing I cannot let go is a few tables have low enough resolution textures on the general playfield that the text is completely unreadable. ST:TNG is a good example of this when trying to read some of the Quadrant names on the ramp. This is double inexcusable because it isn't even on the playfield, which is a huge surface area requiring the polygons to be broken up all over the place to accommodate the lights and different patches of art. Unfortunately I'm talking about something the developers didn't appear to have thought about doing at all. Rather I think they just added one 2k material to the whole field. It's fuzzy. It's ugly. It's not acceptable for a real commercial product. Luckily, it holds up from a distance mostly, doesn't impede gameplay heavily, and only shows up on table exploration. I still believe this is a super simple thing to have gotten right in the first placem, having been a developer myself for a decade now.  It's not all roses after that though, this is a fair review after all. Another thing I'm not too fond of is the game's current pricing structure. $5 a table is more than fair and never will be unfair, however, as a frugal gamer I like to look for bundle packages. This game offers several bundles in the form of pairs of tables, single tables or entire seasons. My gripe is that the seaons are broken apart based upon when the tables were added to Pinball Arcade, not when that table design was released to the public, by theme or any other factor. Farsight's release schedule making any kind of impact on which tables I can bundle together is a lazy move, if not just stubborn, pointless and irritating. $5 a table and $40 for 15-20 is a good deal. However, I didn't pay that for any season other than season 1, because it had the majority of the real tables I was familiar with. I made the decision based on the ratio of tables I knew and wanted to play again. There's at least 10 other tables in the game I played in the arcades and want to purchase, but I'm not buying all the seasons and I'm not paying $5 each too often. I'm not buying anything more than one table every 3 months until I can pay $40 and choose my own 20 tables my own damn self. Stubborn, I know.   I get the seaons thing, I do. It's cute and I'm glad you guys can share in that in the Farsight Offices. We the people could give a $h!t. You're forcing me to buy stuff I don't want to buy in order to buy stuff I do want to buy. This is somewhat standard in the rest of the world, but making me buy 8 things I don't want to get the 2 I do is a ratio I'm not downs with. You can't guess which ones I want. So why are you making an assumption? Kill the seasons and put a personazable bundle system together within the game itself that ties to your website.  I buy directly from within the game in hopes you don't lose a cut to steam.  Pros: 40,000% savings over a real pinball machine per table Accurate visual representation of the real playfields Real board emulation. If it broke here, it broke there too Great Lighting and rendering. Glass is clean and metals shine Good performance, quick loading Fairly fun activities in the form of challenges and goals No table maintenance QUICK TO RESTART A GAME!!!  Cons: Not the real thing Slightly unstable physics under stress (balls pass through rarely) Some tables have buggy cameras Some tables have low resolution playfield textures No global tournament settings Unflexible bundle offers No table maintenance",

I can't say enough good stuff about this series. $40 may seem steep pricewise for a season, but if you truly play alot the savings is immediatly evident as pinball standups cost between 1 and 2 dollars per play now.

That means you have to spend $5 each again on the tables you bought or $30 again for the seasons you purchase. So if you plan on playing this on your mobile app, do not bother with the PC/Steam version unless you have EXTREMELY deep pockets. Cause the prices on this game are highway robbery.  HOWEVER, if you take advantage of Steam sales (like right now) you can afford the season packs. (most of them anyway.) Even if you have to reinstall Windows, the tables will always remain on your Steam account.  Also fyi, if you change phones for any reason, you also lose your tables &amp; have to rebuy your tables again. Which is completely unfair, terrible business practice.  So if you're carrying the mobile version around, pay for tables you play often. Best advice I can give.  Otherwise this has to be the best Pinball simulation I played to date. Beautiful graphics and sound. Just be wary that this is very very expensive.",

I think the 'first two seasons' have the best value because it gets you the most tables per cost, but the later seasons where you get 10 tables for 30 dollars is pretty steep for a game like this.   That being said, I do like the mechanics, it is most 'true to life' pinball available IMO. However, the biggest issue I run into actually playing the tables is their is little to no 'inperfections' on the board. So balls will always 'roll' perfectly and smoothly across. Which makes the game good and bad. Bad in a sense, that when you play the same table IRL and then on the game you could have a wildly different experience, but good, in that you can get a lot of practice on tables and know how you should approach games when you play them in tournaments or at the arcades.   I know some people don't like the UI. I can relate, but to me it's fine. The historical low on DLC has been 14.99 a pack, two months ago they were on sale for around 20 a pack. Which is where I think the price of these should be. I would wait for a sale and get a 'Season or two' of Pinball arcade and it gets a lot funner IMO.   I personally wouldn't waste time getting the pro tables unless you really need options like turning off Extra ball (like they do in pro pinball events.) Otherwise you'll just want to play the games 'stock.'   Overall, I do recommend this game. It's the only option on the market that has real life pinball table emulated as well as they could be.",

Over the past few years the developers have recreated an impressive catalogue of classic machines and the choice is vast.  If you were into pinballs at all you are bound to find a few favourites in here to take you back. The physics are excellent, the sound of each table is utterly authentic and the tables have nice crisp graphics. This is THE pinball sim for anyone seeking out an authentic pinball experience.

No need for Gimmics or Special FX it's as close as you can get without playing the actual Pinball table. Although come to think of it sometimes it's better because there's no dodgy flipper or bad reflections as many Arcades place the tables (in the UK at least) too close to a window.  The DX11 version is the Mutts Nutts (or DB if you prefer !) and with season 5 upon us there are now over 40 tables available. Sure there are a few crap one's but with 3 of my all time arcade favourites in Fish Tales, The Getaway High Speed 2 &amp; Funhouse faithfully reproduced I can't really complain.  The interface is getting a bit clunky now with the number of tables available as you have to scroll through a long list to find the table of your choice. Perhaps a future update will address this with search options or being able to arrange the tables by say season, year or manufacturer as well as a favourites option. When the disc versions of Pinball Arcade  Hall of Fame came out on PS2 &amp; Wii all the tables were represented in an Arcade with so many tables in each room which worked well so something along those lines would be good as well. My only real gripe is the Pro version of the tables which is just a rip off. Why not make them available for free if you achieve all the wizard goals on a table ?.   Above all it's so much fun to play and although I'm a seasoned player I still get frustrated when a ball drains unexpectedly or I tilt the table just short of my all time high score !. But that's what it's all about realistic gameplay that draws you in to having another go. I'm sure you won't regret buying it but I would wait for a sale before buying the earlier seasons. Who know you may get as good as me with lots of practice but I doubt it ! :).",

If you want to start another multiplayer game after both players drain their last ball, you have to go into the menu again.  For some reason I can't enter my initials with a gamepad, even though it works during gameplay. I have to use the flipper buttons on the keyboard instead.  Oh and the ugly menu pops up during the highscore entry too. Way to break immersion.  Camera likes to bug out during multiballs and show the shooter lane instead of the playfield.

I'm not really a pinball afficianado, but I do like browsing through the tables and seeing how trends came and went over the decades. The transition from electromechanical to solid state, the way targets gave way to ramps, the fascination with multiple playfields and flippers that slowly died out, etc. I dunno, it's interesting.  If I had to criticize the game, I'm not a fan of how most tables come in packs of two. I bought Cactus Canyon and found myself saddled with Central Park. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the charms of an electromechanical table, but I'd really prefer something more traditional, like Big Shot. But if I bought Big Shot I'd also get Scared Stiff, which I didn't care too much for, and yeah, you see where this is going.  I'm not knowledgable enough to discuss the physics and how accurate they are. It SEEMS like the ball should be going faster than it is. Compare any gameplay video of a table in Pinball Arcade to a video of its real-life counterpart and you can definitely see a difference. Maybe it's just a matter of perspective. Most videos of real pinball games are shot either from the side or from straight up, and it's been far too long since I've been to an arcade to remember if it feels any different.",

I couldn't quite believe it was the same game, all of the tables look so much better, especially Black Hole, Attack From Mars, and Circus Voltaire. You can even adjust the room lighting (to around 20%) so as to give the feeling of a real arcade, and adjust the lamp brightness accordingly (55% or lower seems good). When playing with the nVidia 3D surround turned on (press Ctrl T to disable/enable it), there is still a little issue with the light from some of the brighter bulbs appearing to be rendered at a slightly incorrect perspective, i.e. 'floating' above the table. I'll try to bring this bug to Farsight's attention, to see if they can get it fixed, but in the meantime just lowering the bulb brightness slightly to around 45% when playing in 3D surround mode with DX11 seems to be sufficient. Note: the room and bulb settings are under each table's options menu, they're not set from the game's launcher. At the moment, to get into fullscreen mode, you can either select it from the DX11 settings in the game's configuration launcher, or press the Alt-Enter key combination while running the game itself. At the moment, when running with DX11, the game only makes use of the center monitor in nVidia 3D surround mode (whereas when running in DX9 mode it uses all three monitors), so it feels slightly less immersive. It'd be nice to get full 5760x1080 resolution working in landscape mode like it does in DX9 mode.

The prices are also pretty reasonable, I'm saving up to buy the 30$ first set but I bought one table for 5$ flat so I'd have soemthing to focus on until then.",

            "review_text": "This review covers Black Hole, Ripley's Believe It or Not, Tales of the Arabian Nights and Theatre of Magic. I will edit the review if and when I buy and play more tables.  The pinball physics engine is really good for the most part. There are some noticeable ball speed issues where they seem to move at unrealistically fast speeds in comparison to real-life pinball machines. Depending on the table, there are some major differences between the quality of the textures and sounds, but it's usually acceptable. The worst textures are of the flooring and walls, but those can't really be considered as being parts of the tables. It would be nice if the developers actually made an effort to polish every facet of the game though, since the flooring and walls are also part of the gaming experience. At the time of this writing we are waiting on an apparently big DirectX 11 patch, but there's no telling if the overall look and presentation will actually be improved or if more negative aspects will be erroneously added because of the update. Let's hope it's a positive change.  Some tables seem to be plagued by various bugs. I'm not sure if these bugs are also present in the real-life machines, but in Ripley's Believe It or Not, there are some game breaking bugs. Balls will get stuck and the game engine doesn't recognize some key moments, and these bugs will make you stuck. The only way to fix it is to quit the game and go back. I've contacted support about these bugs and they said that they are aware of these bugs and are working on fixes at the time of this writing.  All four tables I played seem to be emulated well, despite the issues I've mentioned earlier. What's great about Pinball Arcade is that all tables available are based on actual real-life machines. You won't find any digital pinball related gimmicks or gameplay mechanics. This game is almost like an unlimited, interactive museum of these classic gaming machines where physics, reflexes, and skills are all that matter. On the other hand, in addition to the lack of overall polish and some bugs, my other complaint is about their pricing model. I understand some people may feel that $30 per pack is reasonable, but I feel that it's a mistake. If the prices were lower and if there were good sales, I'm sure they would sell much more on Steam. It also seems like the Steam/PC platform is not their priority, as they appear to be spending much more time with other platforms. Overall, if you have an interest in playing real-life pinball machines on your PC, this is probably one of the best options available, and new tables are supposed to be added on a monthly basis.  Pinball Arcade is good.",

I am lucky enough to have a Pinball museum within driving distance to my house, and I have played many of these tables in person. These tables are good approximations, but you can't really say 'Well, a real table would be $7K, so $7 for a pro version is a good deal.' This is software, and its price does not correspond to its quality, especially without crossplatform play.

I haven't played so much pinball in my days because of the natural reason there haven't been so many tables around, specially not since the '80s-'90s. This is a good way to get familiar with pinball or play all your favorite tables at home. Of course there will always be a difference between real pinball and a game/simulator, but you get very close with all the authentic music, sounds, graphics etc :)  One table is free and you can trial all the other tables.  This is a must-have! (unless you know you don't like pinball)  - The flippers response is a bit slow. - Graphics/textures should be better. - I think there are som bugs that must be fixed (like in most videogames). - The menus could look and be better.  I hope there will come more great tables like The Simpsons, AC/DC, Lord of The Rings etc. My favourite table so far and one of the best pinball-tables: Medieval Madness.",

I struggled with several things: where would I put it, which one would I get, how would I maintain it, how much would it set me back. None of those questions came with easy answers. Pinball arcade is at worst a fair compromise and likely a better choice. I can play all the games I enjoy without all the issues owning a real table would bring. For one, my wife will never get annoyed with how Pinball Arcade looks in the house.  Pinball Arcade feels pretty real. The controls on the keyboard do seem to play a little differently than a real Pinball table--slight hesitation from pressing and releasing the flippers, but this very slight. I notice this when I try to pass the ball from one flipper to the other. It's a reflex I developed on real tables and it doesn't quite work on Pinball Arcade. I've read that the game reacts better to game controllers, however I haven't been able to configure it to work with my game pad yet.   The things I really appreciate are the detail in the tables and the sounds of the games. Some of it is pure nostalgia. The tables offered are some of the best available. If they could get Fish Tales and Addams Family that would be awesome.  The physics of the game are great, however they do take a toll on my PC. I've noticed that if I put the anti-aliasing up to 16X and turn ball reflection on high at full resolution that the game will slow down in multi-ball. With those options disabled, the game keeps a steady frame rate.  I've seen a lot of negative feedback about how the game is free to download with one excellent pinball table, Tales of the Arabian Nights. That seems like a very fair model to me. I'd prefer that the tables be offered as regular DLC, but buying them in game isn't that bad.  I'm not sure why people are upset that they get to play a table for free and are asked to pay money if they want more. If they don't like it they're out the free that they paid.  In conclusion, buy if you are a pinball fan. I trust the developers will continue to improve the very minor issues in the game.",

So many of the boards bring back memories of being in the arcade and pumping token after token into The Addam's Family.

            "review_text": "I’ve never had such a split feeling on a game before. As a set of pinball tables, Pinball Arcade is phenomenal but as a piece of software, it’s a complete mess.  Pinball Arcade’s main competition on steam is Pinball FX2 (AKA Zen Pinball). Both games strive for something different- FX2 is impossible fantasy pinball whereas Pinball Arcade emulates real critically acclaimed tables. Both are equally valid but I definitely prefer the ‘realistic’ take; part of pinball’s appeal to me is the physicality of the mechanics involved. Arcade’s tables were all hand-crafted and manufactured, meaning they’re generally more carefully designed than FX2’s pure-fantasy offerings. Your own preference may differ but its why Arcade and FX2 are the dominant pinball games on steam without competing directly with one another.  The tables in Pinball Arcade are very diverse and you’ll likely find yourself cherry-picking a few favourites you keep coming back to. Acknowledging that I am still a novice player, my favourite tables so far include The Creature From the Black Lagoon, Black Knight 2000, Junkyard, Star Trek: The Next Generation, Funhouse and Taxi. I was very lucky that my favourite tables happened to fall into Seasons 1 and 3 (I have since also purchased Seasons 2 and 4). The tables are pricey although this is forgivable given the overwhelming amount of licencing agreements required (The Addams Family was particularly gruesome in this regard). I would not recommend buying the tables individually. The number of tables in a season is roughly the same as you’d find in an older disc-based pinball compilation for consoles. Even if a season contains a few duds you don’t enjoy, they typically should each offer a decent variety to make the price worthwhile. There does however seem to be a lack of balance between seasons even though they all cost the same. I also don’t recommend the pro versions unless you’re a pinball-superfan. (On a really bizarre note- at the time of writing seasons 1-4 are on sale with the pro versions costing *less* than their regular counterparts).  The most crippling aspect of The Pinball Arcade is the software holding these brilliant pinball tables together. The interface is horrendous. Previous versions of Pinball Arcade I’ve seen on YouTube presented all of the tables in a large list you’d just scroll through, one table at a time. This is fine for maybe the first season or two but when you have 30+ pinball tables the devs quite rightly decided this interface needed to change. Unfortunately, while the new interface is an improvement in principle- it barely functions at all. Its heavily reliant on the mouse and seems to randomly decide if it wants to recognise your controller d-pad inputs or not. I’ve had to create a steam controller profile just so I can comfortably navigate the menus without having to reach for my mouse. Even this solution doesn’t let me adjust the light sliders for some unknown reason. As well as the unpredictable interface I also frequently lose high scores (the entire driving force of playing pinball), goals I’ve completed and even the list of my favourite tables. The only thing that stopped me from just uninstalling the game after losing my original set of scores is that my top score on each table was still saved on my  pinballarcade.com  profile (also the scores weren’t exactly exceptional in the grand scheme of all players). I believe this is related to steam cloud saves so beware when playing this game on a new machine. Pinball FX2 has none of these issues and if I didn’t prefer the tables of Arcade, it would definitively be the superior pinball game on steam.  Its also not a good idea to have music with lyrics for your video game menu. I used to like Pinball Wizard but I now loathe it based on the sheer number of times I've had to listen to its opening lyrics in Pinball Arcade.  The one saving grace is that I’ve never had Pinball Arcade outright crash on me, otherwise this would have gotten the dreaded thumbs down. Perhaps I should give this a thumbs down to encourage the devs to get their act together but the ultimate truth is that Pinball Arcade is still extremely addictive and in a class of its own so I can only hope the devs fix the numerous issues and make this a more comfortable recommendation.",
