            "review_text": "Very good old school FPS, I found it entertaining and original.  The gameplay with the idea of the exoskull armor is cool and allows the player to play with different styles from the hardcore killer rushing everywhere and killing as much opponents as possible to earn money and repair the armor to the complete tactitian playing with support from an ingenior and progressing in the game while being repaired by him.  The good variety of weapons and the old school graphics make this FPS a must play if you want to get rid of your brain for a while and have fun! :D  Do not forget to save the game (first game I've played in which you have to pay game money to save, very funny) because the difficulty of the game can be challenging if you do not take a carreful eye on your armor at all time!  Have a good blood bath guys :0",

That was before modern shooters were a thing, so FPS where you don't run like mad to get bettter accuracy, positioning and else - was refreshing. Didn't beat it, because one of the main bosses (two brothers - champions) was hard as nail.  Decade later, today, I got copy of DRMfree (seriously, StarForce creators are living dastards) game, even if it's not most recent version (get 1.3 patch).  But whole impression went upside down. I don't think that was matter of my inside changes (new tastes and preferences, abilities) but chance to play better games.  Maybe action was too fast? Last time my PC was not powerful, game has lower framerate and it was way easier to shoot these dodging soldats?  I was also shocked when I found that enemies can walk on ladder.  Yes, they do.  When you go deep into game files you find so much wasted potential...",

            "review_text": "I must say I really like the game, but that's just me. In my opinion this is a very good old school shooter, with a decent story. Although not too hard even with the highest difficulty. The ''boss'' battles are fun, but are they hard? That depends on who ''boss'' you choose to fight. You can also buy a mercenary to help you out, but imo they kind of suck. I just usually leave them safe and go fight the enemies myself. I havent tried the multiplayer, but since the game's kind of old, I'm not sure there's anyone to play. Right now I'm doing a playthrough for the game in youtube.  If I have to rate this, I'd give it 8/10",
