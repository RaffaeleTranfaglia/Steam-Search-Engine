            "review_text": " 'Old age is just a record of one's whole life.' - Muhammad Ali   Boy, wasn't that accurate and... depressing... in the right way, I guess. Okay, give me a moment to arrange an actual review from the crippling strike of empathy that I just took to my guts.   Cahors Sunset  is a unique mini game that invites you to become an elderly French man named Valentin Puget. You live and recount your life's tale, alongside witnessing many political changes of France's own history. Your main goal is to keep the old man alive as long as possible by making everyday choices like either drinking a fine wine, or simply visiting your doctor. You have to keep an eye on his social, financial, psychological and physical abilities to present a well balanced life. As months pass and the old man ages even more, he suffers certain ailments and penalties to all his stats. Every single thing that you choose to do carry both positive and negative consequences on different assets. Also, you are the object of happenstances of life that you have no control over, just as real life.  Narration is elegant and realistic, shedding some light to the story of a life and an era while asking the player to emphasize himself/herself with someone that resides in the winter of a life. Challenges of being old, vulnerable and fragile; living side by side with the possibility that it might be your last day on earth is heavy to say the least. You keep living, and living, and living... and at some point, you ask yourself: is this living?  The game leaves you with a sudden urge to stop whatever you are doing, pick up the phone and call your grandparents; just so you can share something, anything with them while it still matters. It leaves you with a short, but strong experience that you can benefit from as a humane virtue.

            "review_text": "TL;DR: The game is a random number generator dependent upon RNG. So long as you keep attributes at a stable level (sometimes dependent upon a lot of luck) you'll survive. The payoff is unrewarding. The game has potential to be more than what it is.   Purchase reason: Game appeared in the new releases of Steam. The description piqued my interest. There aren't many games on the platform that appear to have this type of background. Further, my partner adores French culture and history so that helped the purchase decision.  Install note: Be forewarned that the game will attempt to install Adobe Air when you try and start the game for the first time.  Initial reaction: The concept plays out a little too simply - You make a single choice for the month (they can be very simple things that would be a common occurrence in everyday life such as attending a sports contest). There doesn't appear to be nearly as much substance in the game as what there could be.  In game music: It's pleasant enough to listen to at first. However, I must admit to turning the sound down/off before completing my first game as it became grating.  A possible subtle point of the game: Each month the game provides a description of what is happening in the world beyond your control. This effects your own life minimalistically. As such I can see that this is one of the points that Locomotivah may be attempting to make with the game. That we as individuals believe that what happens in the greater scheme of life may not impact us nearly as much as we may believe it does.  At the beginning of each birth year you make a fresh resolution. This resolution provides a positive and a negative effect each month. One option is to take up smoking which increases your anxiety while decreasing your physical health. Another thing that happens each birth year is that you lose a point in each attribute for each year that you've survived. For example, after your first year you lose one in each category and so on.  Post-first game reaction: My initial reaction stands. The game has potential for deeper gameplay than it currently provides. At this current point in time it's essentially a random number generator with different categories that you can't drop beneath. So long as the RNG is in your favor and you select the most appropriate choice each month you will continue to survive.  Unfortunately, I don't believe that the reward/payoff is rewarding enough for spending much time with the game. Unless, of course, your goal is to get into the top of the leaderboards. That's about all you can hope for as the game has no achievements nor does it have trading cards (yet).  My Recommendation: It's one of those games that deserves an inbetween recommendation. I wouldn't recommend purchasing it by itself - even though at $2 or $1.69 with its 15% launch promotion it's certainly priced correctly - but it is something that's worth a playthrough if the setting and the mini-storyline piques your interest. I'd recommend holding off for an inevitable indie bundle.",
