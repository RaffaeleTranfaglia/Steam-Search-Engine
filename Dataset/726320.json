    "description": "Girl Blonde - It's a nice 3D platformer with a side view. In it you have to play for a girl-blonde and gather fruits, vegetables and other sweets! That would pass the level you must collect a certain number of items, but it is not easy to do because you will interfere with obstacles.",
