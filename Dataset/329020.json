    "description": "Battlegrounds of Eldhelm is an indie, online, free-to-play CCG (collectible card game) / RPG (role playing game). It is heavily influenced by RPGs and borrows some mechanics and ideas. The result is a fascinating mixture between role playing game and a classic card collection game.",

Play the game.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  I always wanted a card game where you controll only 1 character and the cards are your actions and I was glad to find this on steam but I had never expected such a good game.   This is the most balanced card game I have ever played. It's is not as much luck based as it is strategy based.  When you level up you level up good and yet I found myself having a hard time fighting a level 2 in multiplayer while I was level 10.   A lot of depth in strategy , a ton of things to do like some good game modes to play and quests etc and a hell of a good game.  Note: I play all kinds of games. Also love card games like MTG etc ",

            "review_text": "This is a rather simple and casual CCG with pretty much no complexity. You don't really have to strain your brain on this one, game requires very minimal thinking due to the lack of card effects, but more so on that later.  Once you beat the tutorial you'll have to create a character (you have to pay real money if you want to have more then one character). You can pick between 3 different races (Orcs, Humans, Elves). Orcs have only one class which is Warrior, Humans have Knight and Rogue while Elves have Archer and Mage. Each class has different stats and different class-specific cards it can use.  The main problem in this game is the previously mentioned lack of complexity. Pretty much all cards will do one of the following: Deal damage to enemy, Increase your defense, Decrease enemy defense, Heal you, Increase your energy (mana), Decrease enemy damage. The only difference between those cards is the energy cost and the numeric value of their effect and the fact that some of them will do multiple of those effects. Due to that there's very minimal amount of strategy and thinking involved with this game.  In the match, you'll have Random Deck and Collector Deck. You can draw cards from either of them during the Draw Phase. Once the match is over the cards that you used from Random Deck are added to your Stash and you can then transfer cards from Stash to your Collector Deck. You can only have 10 cards in your collector deck when your character is level one, but you gain more slots in collector deck as you level your character up.  When your character levels up you can increase his HP, Energy, Regeneration (heal per turn), Might (extra damage) or Resistance (extra defense). This is an interesting feature, but if you get matched against enemy who's level is higher then yours you'll be at disadvantage (I haven't played enough to know how good is their match making system).  Now would I recommend this game? I don't know really. I wish the game had more complexity to it but maybe it will have in the future. I'd say if you're a fan of CCG's or are interested in them and what you've read in this review didn't make you not want to ever try this game, then do give it a try. After all it's free and only about 100 MB to download so if nothing else it's worth giving a try. Just do keep in mind you're likely to find it boring if you're not into casual games.",

I have been stuck in a daily quest (Break the Siege) where the same opponent (fought this encounter against all classes) plays 1 card for 3 dmg and throws a 60dmg hit out of nowhere or plays the +15hp card every turn until I am out of cards... I waited some days for it to reset. Didnt. I am now without an option to play daily quests. The game is decent but boring, obviously a bit bugged. Needs polishing and updates on cards.  Play but dont get addicted just yet. 5.5/10",

            "review_text": "It's a fun game for a single player, but a dead one in terms of multiplayer play.  Had the availability to connect to one of two servers, and each one combined together was still less than 100 people online playing.  If you enjoy card games and solo-campaign play, then you'll probably enjoy this game.  If you enjoy playing against others, then you may find yourself frustrated as you wait for someone else. I also never truly completed a PVP match, as my opponent I'd be facing seemingly timed out or disconnected. I've no idea if it was poor luck in connections, or a case where the multiplayer code is horrendous.  The only thing that keeps me from really recommending it is if it's this dead now, even after a recent release for Mac's, then how much longer before the single player aspect disappears as well (since you're still online when playing solo).",
