    "description": "Celestian Tales: Old North is a refreshing take on the classic turn-based Japanese style RPG. Scrapping away the cliché of a destined person or a boy/girl-saving-the-world, the story is tailored for a mature audience and questions the bare morals of a human being.",

            "review_text": "A for effort but his game failed to deliver in a lot of ways. There were a lot of good concepts here that were just poorly executed. I'll list a few of the bigger complaints just as a heads up.  The idea to choose from different perspectives is really neat and interesting, but the actuall difference is so shallow that it hardly warrants an actual replay. The most you get for playing different characters is a few cutscenes, nothing that drastically changes the game. Maybe if I beat it with all 6 characters I would see a greater impact, but as it stands now, it isn't worth the investment.   The story had a chance to be interesting, fighting giant barbarian like creatures in an epic war, however you never actually get to do that. Your ragtag band of 'squires' just run around doing meanial tasks that frankly, just feels like filler. I get that you're squires, and not exactly battle tested, but you don't do anything exciting. The boss fights are weak (and I'm just assuming the dire wolf and pig you fight are the boss fights) except for two of them, and one of them you don't even fight as the squires.  Then there is the end of the game. After about 7 hours of boring chores and vague cutscenes (which at the times I just assumed would be better explained later, but now I'm pretty sure that if you want a better understanding of them you have to replay the game as said character) there is a drastic plottwist, a boss fight (which was pretty challenging and fun) and then an abrupt end. No explanation at all, just a massive cliffhanger then the credits roll. Which is a shame because it ends right as the game gets interesting.   There are other minor cons and pros, but anything else I could say would just be parroting other reviews, and honestly a lot of them are just opinionated remarks that players could take as either or depending on what they like in a game. I just wanted to hit some major fall offs so anyone thinking about getting this game knows what they're in for. The game info is pretty accurate when it says 'you are not special'.",

Graphic: Impressively drawn animations, beautiful cutscenes, overall great job was done here.  Sound: LOTR look a like, It didnt pass 5 seconds of first song, and I knew I would love it, overall AWESOME.  Gameplay: Interesting storyline, funny conversations, couple of playable characters with unique story that will provide you just enough playtime. Great combat system and mechanic, same goes for abilities, inventory and leveling, so even beginners will find it easy to get. Controls are complicated by default if you dont own joystick, but you can easly change it on keyboard to what suits you best.    Personaly I didnt encounter any bugs or glitches, however I do have constant minor rendering issue. It is visible, but not affecting general gameplay. Note to devs : Please do add some minimap ^^  Price is decent and affordable so I can recommend this game to anyone who love JRPG or adventure games.  Overall rating :  Sound 10/10 Graphic 8/10 Gameplay 7/10  Total score : 8/10 Worth buying",

            "review_text": "Too short. Too simple. Should be called Celestian Tales Chapter 1. At $10 you are paying the right price for quality art and music, and some good, but under expressed ideas. The story itself is short - when the game ended I thought it was the end of a prolog. I think that when the developer is done with all of the games the Celestian Tales title will be a play worth RPG and a great value at a higher price.  You can replay the game as all 6 characters, but a majority of the content is the same, and not so interesting to be worth playing again. Grinding is necessary a few hours into the game as the difficulty of enemies spikes wildly and without warning between zones. The few moral choices that you make have a minimal impact on the game. Perhaps the consequences of these choices will show up in the next game.",

I went through it leisurely and I have like less than 7 hours of gameplay I think. Though others may find the story much more worth the short run time. It is a must-play for any fans of old school RPGs though. The art direction and sound design are leagues above what I expected or as compared to other games at similar pricepoints.  TL;DR Winter is coming, but only with a discount.",

The plot looks extremely incomplete: as soon as some stuff are revealed and so it  may  get interesting, endscreen is sent to you, game is completed.  The leveling system is weak: you level up and each level (up to 20) you get a new skill for a character. At level 20, reached easily, you maxed out all characters. Combat system is simple, almost weak, but it has a few challenging battles (with some trashes) near the end. I think it can be improved a lot, it gets repetitive after a while. Equipment are nice, but there are 3 weapons per character? I'm ok but extend my choice a little bit, especially because the 3rd weapon per character is obtained so early on, you'll wear the same gear for half of the game thinking you'll get improvements (and you don't).  What's nice? The graphics are well done, even animation, and I know how painful is to work on them with a small team. The combat system has solid basics although fairly incomplete. I like the idea of full regen after fight and the stamina mechanic.  Must be worked on, can't recommend it unles it's made clear in title that the game is a  chapter 1  of some sort",

            "review_text": "##This review might be long, I tend to get ahead of myself when I write, but I do go into details. You have been warned.##  ##Introduction##  Alright so I've finished the game after (according to my record) 7 hours of gameplay and I've had some thoughts for a while now about the game and what I've payed for. I'm an old school RPG player with extensive experience in games so I'm hoping I can give a fair judgement of this game with this review.  Let me start by saying, that the game is actually quite short. Some people have stated that it is up to 12 hours long, but I really dont see how they could have played for that long, since I played 7 hours and collected almost everything, i think i was 4-5 items short (achievement items), I'm one of those who basically wants to collect everything in game, as long as it doesnt take forever (there is a limit!).  You could in theory complete this game in less than 5 hours and basically see everything there is to see. With ONE character, let me be clear about that, because the game do encourage you to try the game with more than 1 character.   ##Trying to be make a list##  I'll just start by stating the obvious stuff:  ## Graphics ##  The game has a pretty art style, atleast if you look at the trailer, but if you look in the details you'll see that it's really sloppy. A lot of the background melts into the actual gamplay, and you often walk right into walls at the start of the game. Later on, you learn what's a wall and what's not, but you still get irritated at 'being slowdowned' whenever you touch a wall. I can see why, but it's really annoying. I would'nt hit that wall if it was made more clear.   Later on you realise that the 'walking-graphic' and background graphic is really limited and it feels like a cheap version of a JRPG where you cant really move anywhere without hitting a wall, you want freedom, but you get none. And in that sence this game is really linear. The walls prevent you from walking anywhere than where your supposed to. But this also leads to a really slow and boring experience, because your limited to where you can walk.   You also recognise a lot of the sprites of the characters, especially if you have played ragnarok online. The Dev's have stated that they have been inspired by ragnarok online but that they have drawn all the sprites themselfs, but I simply can't see their own 'touch' to these sprites, it really looks like they've just almost stolen it completely and put it in their own game.  ##fighting##  Anyway, lets move on. After you have grumbled a bit about the graphics and start playing the game, you will soon start fighting. There is no real tutorial in the game, nor is there any manual that will help you out if you're wondering about stuff.  For example, after I had played for a while i was wondering what 'power' does, or what 'dexterity' does in this game, since I found some accessories that gave me these stats. I actually inquired about this on the forums, and the devs were fast to respond about the actual meanings of the statistics. Which is really nice, it shows that they care. But the game need this info to be in the game, in the lore book for example, not in the steam forums. But even without that knowledge, the combat in this game is quite simple. They do try to make it hard by making some enemies hit you extremly hard. I'm not kidding here, the enemys hit you 1 time, and you are down to half health.  You can ofcourse prevent this with several abilitys, and characters, and this leads down to you selecting your preferble setup. And there is some number chrunching here, but not that much. I actually had to change my setup once.. at the end of the game. But that was it. I've even seen someone state that they didnt even use a single heal in the game, they just powered through the whole game.  ## the story ##   The story if great, that is all. Experience it by yourself. I'm not going to spoil, there is enough of that in the forums.  ## other stuff ##  So alright, I think I've covered most of the stuff, but here is a few things that annoys me.   ## Rant to devs ##  TIMESINKS, im not kidding. I sometimes get the feeling that the developers in this game put in timesinks in this game just to make it longer. Just so they could say that the game was 7 hours long, instead of 5. These timesinks are so blatantly obvious it makes me so angry. While i was playing i was talking out loud that 'why do you do this? It's stupid!' because it was.  As an example: You get a chapter in the game where you're mission is to go to a place and investigate a persons home. You have to walk first to the person who gives you the quest, then through the whole city (as stated earlier, you have no freedom, you can only walk on certain paths, so walking through the whole city takes atleast 1,5 min), walk through a forest of enemys, and once u get to that house you get some boring conversations about nothing, and then you have to walk all the way back.  You do not do this only once, you do this atleast 4 more times in the game if not more, but in other circumstances. It's really obvious, and its really annoying. Do not do that again in you're games, its stupid and obvious and really takes away all feeling. Atleast, atleast put an event when you finally reach the place, not just conversation where you have to walk up to the person and talk and they say something, and say the same thing when u click again. At least put an effort and make an event or boss fight, or bandits, or.. whatever! Don't be so lazy, that you dont even put anything there, but the 'idea' that this is a good time to visit other places (without hinting about it). You walked all the way there, to do what?   urrrgh. Anyway. This game is what you pay for. It would probably do better as a novel than a game in my honest opinion, cause the writing is alright. The game, no not so much.      ",

            "review_text": "Idk whether to reccomend this or not honestly. I had a good base but overall seemed to lack a lot of content. If I had to sum up this review in a few words I would say this feels more like a 5$ game than 15$.  Story: The story had a good base, but there are tons of holes and dead ends as you progress through it. For instance, you will meet someone who seems like they are going to have a large role in the story, but then you will never see them again. The variance between the 6 characters as far as storyline is rather minimal, not something that i feel is worth playing through again. All in all, this felt more like a prologe or DLC to a larger game and I sincerely hop they dont try to plug the holes in the story with dlc and they just fix things in the next game.  Combat: The combat system and items etc are kinda shallow. I suppose they are about equal with how much story there is but you basically get 3 different types of each weapon with 2 upgrades (C-the standard,C+ and B quality) The only time I felt it was necessary to use any skill other than heal was the final boss, everything else was spammming auto attacks. That being said, the final boss was actually a challange (everyone in my party died and got ressed at least twice throughout the fight). And there seems to be no upgrade for armor.  I'd like to do one more playthrought before I go any futher on this, but right now... I think this game is just lacking too much",

            "review_text": "I've never written a review before, but I feel it necessary to chime in here. To clarify some points in the negative reviews:   1. This is part one of three, I believe. So, yes, plot holes and a cliff hanger ending are appropriate. I am, in fact, looking forward to how some of those things play out in later games.  2. I did not find grinding necessary. Just use your team wisely. For the basic battles I went all dps; for boss battles I might swap in the tank. All team members level up regardless of who is used in the battle, so that's not a problem. Understand your teams abilities and use them and there is no need for grinding. I liked the battle system and the fact that some thought is required. I look forward to that being more fleshed out in the future games (such as bigger emphasis on skill combinations that build damage).  3. The way the description is worded did make me think there were going to be moral decisions for me to decide. This was not really the case, save one or two instances. There are many moral situations the characters face and interact with, and, with a quick re-read of the description, I can see how that might be what they meant. However, this does not mean it's a bad thing. The character's interactions with the moral problems did cause me to think about them, right and wrong, and see the problems from different perspectives. And I think that is a pretty cool accomplishment.   4. The setting may be a little cliche, but the plot and characters, at least to me, are not. It was fun to see the characters grow a bit as people as they face and deal with the issues that arise through the game. Again, that's something I look forward to developing in future games.  5. Game length: Steam says 11.5 but in game time says over 16 hrs, I believe. I don't know how people are beating this game so fast (glitch that was patched out?) I do take my time with these games and look around and talk to people, but still. Anyway, take that for what it's worth.  6. I personally did not have a problem with navigation, and that skill is not one of my strong points. Just pay attention to the conversations, and you'll know where to go.  Nit pick time: The main city took a bit too much time to navigate for my tastes. I wish there was a super dash button or something. There was one instance where the story required me to do a lot of walking that just seemed entirely pointless. Cut scene me over there or something. Also, no d-pad support for the controller. I just used joy-to-key, but it would be nice if that was something we could do in-game. Lastly, no side quests. The pace of the story was quick, and perhaps side quests would have distracted from that, but I do hope they throw some in in future installments.  With that out of the way, I liked it! I wish there was more (weapons, armor, skills, story), but this is only part one and wanting more is not a bad thing! I would recommend throwing your money at these guys for a great game and so we can see what more they can do.",

Why? The character level is, in fact, the party level. At a level up, EVERYONE benefits, and no one is left behind, allowing you to safely swing around your party line-up to suit yourself best against whatever the area throws against you.

I'd like to preface the below with this: buy it at $5 or less, $15 is a joke.  While thoughtful and clever at times, the story missed the mark for all of the glaring holes, in particular, one of the characters is a functional macguffin, whenever the story requires a relevation, it falls to her. Let's call her... Velma.   Thankfully, the party is formed of intelligent characters, which shows in their converstations and the paths they draw upon. Too bad the supporting cast of NPC's, which the story spends a good amount of time establishing as sane, falls apart in plot-driven Chaotic Stupid. Naturally, as with any morally astute story there's a moral compass, and as such she plays the child very well. Plus she finger paints and spent most of her years high (Upon a Tree) in the clouds with other hippies. Let's go with Shaggy here.  I liked the combat system, especially the concept of juggling aggro. To bad that this means your healer will probably suck it all up with skills and items, like the uptown girl who plays jack of all healing trades and can't tank... I dubbed her Dauphney.  Rather than buying new weapons, the game has you upgrading existing ones, while each person as enough to adapt to a particular playstyle. Sucks that there's no real way to compromise for a middle road though, like the pragmatic-yet-idealistic soldier-woman who's equipment can't agree on giving or taking ♥♥♥♥... Madame Fred, I call thee.  Of course, they've also implemented a skill system, which further allows you to customize the characters to whatever playstyle you enjoy. It's a shame when you realize certain characters are a far superior than others, like the po' boy poster child-turned murderhobo's E-skill. Such a lovely character, that Scooby-Doo. (Pro-tip: Just feed Isaac power and the highest dps you can, and he'll wipe an Andori... Rons... Or... ...Blue-thing a turn.)  The problem with these two systems, though, is some characters clearly blur without synergy, especially towards the end, their skills and equipment make them prime for backwards strategies and I can't decide if it's intentionally clever or a natural reaction to the emplaced system(s). Prime culprits include the loud-mouth who's character growth chart looks like a big O expression. Rather 'Scrappy' fellow.   If the above seems somewhat harsh, and you're still here, I'd like to soften a little: This game isn't bad, but it has two flaws, It's rushed, and it's not complete. Yes I know there's supposedly more, but this isn't EA, and while well done for a group of hindi trying their hand at Western motifs and imagery it's no GoT. (Though it's on par with Tactics...'till the end...)  Yep, that final boss soured the whole thing for me, and if you sit back and think, it probably will for you too.",
