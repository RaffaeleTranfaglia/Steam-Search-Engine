    "description": "Following a great increase in terrorism, internal strife and ultimately, the nuclear destruction of Washington, D.C., the United States shatters into a half-dozen nation-states that descend into war. Take the helm of one of these newfound sovereignties (or the 'peacekeeping' European Expeditionary Force) and struggle to reunify America...",

I'm using Windows 7 and get nothing but a black screen and then the game crashes. Read the small print of the system requirements which they have conveniently changed since I bought the game, it used to read XP, Vista and Windows 7.  I also think older XP systems that have more then 2GB of memory/RAM may have problems running the game as well. If so there is a workaround where you go into MSconfig and set your system to only use 2GB of memory. Search google for the exact method. Be sure to turn it back though after playing the game as your computer performance will suffer with only using the 2GB of memory.  Luckily I bought this game on sale for like $2 so not much lost but be forwarned everyone else. ",

Yes, i am aware the community found a fix, but this didn't work for me - and some others as well, and've damn tried to fix it - and i'm not particularly sloppy with these kinds of things. It simply doesn't work.  I used to play this game a few years back, which was an enjoyable - though unoriginal - TBS. Could've recommended it back then, but considering the circumstances, steer clear of this game.",

Well the price droped enough to make the risk worth it, and it has worked just fine on my Win10 OS. It is a great game that requires tactics to win, the graphics are better then the XBOX360 and it seems to have all the features I remember. Finding a manual is as easy as finding google maps...you just have to hit a few keys and you have it.",
