            "review_text": "Rosa Blackwell's life isn't going so well. She's become an antisocial shut-in, her work as an amateur book reviewer for a local paper is beginning to suffer, and her only relative has just passed away after succumbing to what might possibly be hereditary madness. And as if that wasn't enough, she's begun to see and hear a smart talking ghost who has revealed himself to be something of a family heirloom.  This is The Blackwell Legacy, the first of five chapters chronicling the events of Rosa and her new life partner, Joey, who have quickly become shackled together and must now make the most of their predicament. Perhaps not an entirely original premise, but that fact seems to be entirely lost on Blackwell, which disregards any accusations of being cliched in order to tell an expertly penned and even more impressively acted narrative that quite frankly transcends the game it's attached to. Characters are written and voiced with a deeply personal feel, easily engrossing you in their lives and making you care about their outcomes despite the game lasting little more than a few hours. The plot is slow to unfold, but as the first game in the Blackwell series it acts almost more like a prologue, spending most of the time introducing you to the characters that you'll be seeing for the next four games, and in that regards is entirely successful.  It's a tad disappointing then that the actual adventure game elements so often fall into the same issues that have plagued the genre since its inception. Most annoying is how often you are left without any direction or indication of where you are supposed to go, what you need to say, or who you should be interacting with. This left me consistently walking in circles as I tried every option I could, only to realize I'd missed something a ways back that seemed entirely unrelated. It's tedious and confusing, and really got in the way of the best part of Blackwell, which is its story.  Even so, it's worth pushing through the convoluted puzzle logic in order to experience the surprisingly excellent narrative, which not only delivers a highly intriguing story in its own right but sets up so much potential for what is to come of the series. I wasn't sure quite what I was getting into when I decided to checkout The Blackwell Legacy, but am certainly glad I did and am eager to see where it might go next!

The sequence with the teenager preventing you from getting into your own building strains credibility... in a story heavily involving ghosts. However, taken as a whole, even that sequence is used well. The story is solid. Once you finish, you might be surprised that the game isn't longer. But it's not fair to call it short. Assuming you've avoided using a walkthrough, you're likely to find the puzzles more challenging than you might expect. But they're well constructed -- even the hard ones. That's worth a bit of praise in and of itself. I'm looking forward to seeing how the rest of the series plays out!",

There's one puzzle thats kind of ♥♥♥♥ed up by the end because the game mechanic was never explained to you. The voice acting is pretty good. There's some characters that you really want to punch right in the face. That's how believable the voice acting is. There's some decent music for this game. The other games have better atmospheric music, but this one is decent enough to get your emotions flowing.  Overall, It's a decent start to the series. Keep in mind, while they are all episodic, they all interconnect so it is not entirely pointless to play this game. And it's best played in order because they references each other. The characters get their start here, and lead them to become likeable in the future",

I hated it, even if I skipped all of them * few second I missed to click anything and 1 voice comment gave me a hint.... Nice spoiler, thanks... * The puzzles were odd * The connections between characters started nice, but ... for a 1-3 hours game - I kinda feel like I miss few - tens more conversations and meetings. * only few places to visit and strictly limited * I find it strange that proto find it normal to see a &lt;spoiler&gt; in just a few moments * I find it super strange that auntie stop doing &lt;spoilers&gt; * I find it super irritating , that I MUST save that &lt;spoiler&gt; and find a way to clean him... &lt;last puzzle&gt; * The first scene where I couldn't get to my house becasue of that.... wow... it is supper lame...  Anyway, music, graphic, few lines of Roseangela and even Joey convinced me , even in this irritating scenario. They somehow save it, but for this lenght of a game - I can't give a positive rating.

The story is alright despite being a tad cliche which it even mentions by one of the characters, and my favorites out of those said characters were Joey and Nishanthi, the rest not so much.   However when Tim Curry from Legend shows up it's cute.   If I was to give one critisism it's that the voice acting ain't the best as some people do sound a bit bored.  As for the music it's passable but the best part of the game is the art. It's wonderful, especially the portraits so kudos to those who worked on that.   I'd recommened it but I'm wanting to play the other ones in the series to see if it would work much better as a collective. As its own containted story however it's fine and is worth your time.",

The concept of being a spiritual medium detective was ruined by the lackluster story, game-play, and character development. The game can be described as underwhelming. Even the games ending, which should have been the most tense moment in the game just felt lackadaisical. The game has a neat idea in terms of a story but fails to deliver on actual storytelling. I have only played the first game in the series, so I cannot be a fair judge for the whole series, however after playing the first game I don't feel that it is worth playing the rest.

            "review_text": "The Blackwell Legacy is a great example of an older game genre - in this case, Point-and-Click Adventure - brought forward into the modern era of gaming. There's a certain undeniable charm to the old Point-and-Click Adventure genre, but with that charm often comes a lot of baggage: esoteric puzzles, picky controls, and solutions requiring advanced knowledge of completely unexplained game mechanics. The story may be compelling, but you spend so much time tearing your hair out in frustration that the enjoyment is dulled a bit. With that in mind, what makes The Blackwell Legacy such a good game is that it (mostly) avoids these pitfalls while providing an interesting and deep story for players to enjoy.  Now that is not to say it is a perfect game in that regard. A few of the 'puzzles' (such as they are) do require you to do some thoroughly unexpected things that only make sense when you've exhausted all your other options. For the most part though, the game presents you with obstacles that can be solved using plain (if convoluted) logic, rather than the dodgy 'Adventure game logic' that so many of us seasoned Adventure game veterans are used to. When you solve a puzzle you feel as though you actually solved something, rather than just mashing through combinations until something stuck.  Story-wise, The Blackwell Legacy provides something interesting with a lot of fairly original ideas (or at least combinations of ideas). The protagonist, Rosangela Blackwell, is neither a blank slate nor an overdramaticized bundle of one-liners, with a personality that is rather unique for a player character. Her ghostly sidekick Joey has his own personality as well, providing a welcome contrast to Rosa without clashing unduly with her, and the interactions between the two are thoroughly enjoyable. Rather than just being two shallow personalities thrown at the story, both Joey and Rosa have well-developed backstories, though we only get glimpses at smaller parts of the whole. Still, it's enough to give both them and the world they inhabit a depth that would otherwise be lacking, making the story something you are more likely to care about.  The story itself is reasonably straightforward once you know it all, but is presented at just the right pace such that you are drawn in and eager to know both what happened before and what happens next. Unfortunately, the story is also a bit short, easily completed in a handful of hours or less. There's nothing wrong with this - it's meant to be an episodic title with a price point to match, after all - but with such developed characters and mechanics the brevity of the plot leaves you strongly wanting more.  Now with all this positive prose I do have to mention (or perhaps reiterate) that this game is not perfect. Some few game mechanics are a bit obscure or are implemented poorly, and at many times the plot is delivered via a massive bit of verbal exposition (read: some dude talking at you a lot). These elements aren't dealbreakers, but they do detract from the game's overall quality. That said, they are not the majority of the game, and if you listen to the game's commentary creator Dave Gilbert explicitly admits that many of these mechanics were a mistake.  At the end of the day, The Blackwell Legacy is a very well made, well scripted, and well designed Point-and-Click Adventure game. More importantly, it's also an enjoyable game, even if it may be the weakest game in the series. If you have any love for the genre you owe it to yourself to pick this up and set aside a few hours to play through it.",

Rosa is pretty awkward, but her cynicism makes her fun enough to listen to. The game has great 2D pixel art. It's also fully voice-acted, which adds quite a lot.

From King's Quest I, all the way through Sierra and LucasArts heydays, right through to today with Broken Age and Telltale's Walking Dead, I've enjoyed the adventure game genre more than any other.  Which is why I confidently say that the Blackwell games are some of my favourite adventure games. It features a great cast of well-defined characters - including a great female lead. The puzzles are clever, sometimes challenging, but rarely impossible. The series also showcases some of the best voice acting in an adventure game - or video games at all. One would assume the worst from an indie game, but developer Wadjet Eye games brings out their A game for the voice talent.  And it all starts here, with Legacy, all culminating to the fifth and final chapter, Blackwell Ephiphany. You're doing yourself a disservice by being a fan of adventure games and not playing these. Even better, each game includes some fun achievements, as well as commentary by the funny and humble Dave Gilbert. He shares some great antecdotes on developement and admits to his faults throughout the series.",

Firstly it's way too short and in essense an episodic game.This is the first episode. It's quite short, with very few locations. I do think there could have been more characters/locations despite it only being an episode. It felt like they didn't have the resources to spend time drawing more locations or paying for other voice actors. All 5 episodes it would make a game that's £15 for the bundle plus £7, which is way too much for 10 hours of gameplay. Only buy the bundle when it's reduced to £4 (which it will be). Unless ofcourse value for money doesn't bother you because it is way overpriced for such a graphically weak short game.   Anyway it's a good premise but disapointing in it's execution. While there was a mystery, there could have been more twists to the mystery. But there is scope for the rest of the series....which I haven't played yet.   The story telling is good and unlike some reviewers I quite liked the main protoganists. There's good chemistry between the 2 with good voice acting. The music creates a nice atmosphere.  The graphics are obviously indie and 'retro' but you get used to them. The design is good, it's just very Atari/Amiga days. Initially it put me off.   The puzzle system is different to most point and clicks, you get info through speach as with many on the genre but workout everything with your notepad. I did like the puzzles for the most, most were logical while a few weren't. But it's better than some.   I'd recomend this game only to hardcore adventure gamers who've played all the classics. And even then I'd only recomend it on offer. It says I played this for 4hours but it was less than 2 as I left the game running. By the end with all the story revealed I just wanted to be finished with it but there were interesting parts earlier in the game.   6/10 - only buy on offer and you need to buy the bundle as this is pretty incomplete as a single episode.",

For me, the Ouija board thing had me rolling my eyes in frustration, and the religious themes don't jive with me all that well. And it was very, very short. If it was not on a huge discount when I bought it, I would have felt quite dissapointed. ",

You play as the everyday socially-awkward Rosa Blackwell, who's turned spirit-medium detective when the 'Blackwell legacy' is passed down to her. A spirit, named Joey.  The story of the game, which involves a mixture of the super-natural, a classic detective story and some other things too, is very interesting, and it leaves loads of room for development, which I hope they'll use in the sequels. The gameplay is fun, but can be fiddly sometimes. The music's good, and all lines are voiced.  The game does have flaws though. It starts off rather poorly, and there's a few things in there that can be considered a bad move in adventure game design.   But overall, the interesting story, fun characters and the feel the game manages to build up is enough to make up for the flaws. I'll defiantly be giving the sequels a go, to see where the story leads.  Plus, the game has some behind the scenes bloopers, as well as commentary tracks, which gives an interesting look into the making of the game (plus also some admissions by the developer himself on some of the games flaws which makes them even easier to overlook) which gives some replay value to things.  A good package for just 3.99.",

If you enjoy investigations, adventure games, ghost stories and moving experiences, get the game, or rather, the whole series. If you're not quite sure, get just this first one and give it a try. The chapter's finale is very intense and finishing the game will have your thoughts provoked for quite some time.  The puzzles are challenging yet not irrational or overly complicated – you need to listen to the dialogues carefully and pay attention to the envioment, but there's no excessive pixel hunting or other annoying elements you may hate in other adventure games. You can always consult your sidekick for a clue and this whole thing works very well and yet it doesn't feel artificially implemented.  Finishing the game takes about one or two afternoons, the story is very fluent and the universe and its rules are very likable. The stories of each chapter are connected, but since this is the very first chapter, it will also work on its own without you having to play the other chapters. I'm pretty sure you'll get them anyway once you finish this one as, even though you may not realize when playing, you'll miss the characters once you finish the game and you'll want more and see how the story continues.  tl;dr: get the game, at least on a sale, enjoy it, get the rest of the series",

A shy, awkward and introverted young woman named Roseangela Blackwell (or Rosa for short) has recently lost her only surviving family member, but to her shock discovers she may have also inherited an unexpected family legacy and gift  It's probably the least strong game in the series, but is still enjoyable and a good intro to the series. The first puzzle can be irritating to some, (because the solution should be very simple but Rosa's low self confidence makes her refuse to take the direct approach forcing you to take a very roundabout one). However I felt it fit her character and high level of shyness given the situation, and as Rosa herself grumbles at one point 'we can't all be social butterflies'.   The characters, ghosts and humans alike, are believable, and likeable. The game has a good atmosphere, and good voice acting too.  Its medium (pun not intended) to short in length,the other games (except prequel Unbound) are longer, but I don't feel this took away from this game at all.   In fact I'd recommend the whole series. Anyone who likes point and click adventures with great story telling and characters, should enjoy this series. It's also great to see the development of Rosa and Joey (Joey, although helpful, does seem slightly resentful of Rosa for not being Lauren in this game). How Joey gradually grows to respect and care about Rosa, instead of just being obliged/duty bound to help her, and how Rosa gains confidence and becomes bolder and more proactive in solving cases as the series develops is one of the things I love about it, the main and recurring characters (the main two especially) do mature, grow, and change as the games progress. The over arcing plot also thickens and gets darker further into the series, and raises many questions which both Rosa and Joey must find an answer despite the risks.  This series has become one of my favourites :)",

This adventure is comparable with the good old ones I've played like Simon the Sorcerer 1 and 2 or Kings Quest 5 and many others.   The controls  are simple and solid. Just left or right-click things to interact or analyze them. You can't click that much objects so it doesn't get anoying like in other point and click adventures. Also you don't have that much items, so you don't have to try to combinate things for houers.    The graphics  are very lovely in 320x240 resolutions and 256 colors. The background and characters could have been made a bit more detailed but the portraits in conversations are just beautiful.    The voice acting  is okay, dialoges are interesting and sometimes funny. Also there are not much nonsense dialoges. The speach mechanism is nice because you have to choase 'options' not just the words that will be spoken. You also have a notepad in which you have to combinate clues. Also you can ask some people about these clues on the notepad.   The puzzles  are not that hard to solve but sometimes you have to listen carefully to know what you have to do know. (I just say: the dog). Also sometimes its not that clear where to go next but since there are just a small count of places to go, you will figure it out.   The story  is lovely as well. You play a cute journalist named Rosanna who has just lost her aunt and should write an aritcle about a recent suicide in a college campus or so. After a while she meets a ghost named Joey who is telling Rosa that she's a medium and has to free ghosts that are confused and trapped in this world.  The only thing I don't like is the ugly perspective problem. When someone walks into the background, they get blurry because there is no pixelate animation for walking away from the camera and getting smaller (you know, because of the perspective). This happens fortunately just in 2 or 3 scenes. This made a minus point in my rating.  There are sometimes little bugs like in one of the conversations with the security guard in the hospital or that the fusebox key doesn't have a transparent background in the inventory and just such little things (made a minus point in my rating)",

Some of the puzzles are a little obtuse, not so much because of the concept but the details of how to use the game tools to accomplish it. I got the RADICAL SATAN ENDING rather than the 'good ending' because the game doesn't really do anything to communicate when items are placed in your inventory or concepts placed in your notebook.

The game is very short, you can beat it in about 2 hours. But for a $5 price tag that can go down as much as 90% during a major sale it's well worth your money  A few tips:  1) Joey can interact with babies, animals and interfers with electronics.  2) People can lie, but usually 'fess up when you call them on it.  3) If Rosa can't get somewhere, Joey can.  4) Don't talk to Joey in public.  5) If you get a name, try looking it up!

Yes, 'episode', it's not too long, doesn't open potential much yet.  The game runs on quite old engine even if it was updated up, and while it was running fine for me, the others had problems with blurry image (for me it was becoming blurry only when sprites were being scaled). So if you don't get your nice pixel-good image, you will have to do your things in config files or something. It also has a lot of small glitches, mostly interface-related, though I didn't encounter any game-breaking ones. And yes, there is a 'bug' where if you shift+tab, all the dialogues will be sped up to instant. Pressing tab button again 'fixes' it. Not sure if it's bug, could be a debug command that is placed on same keys as Steam Overlay.  While the game bears a beatiful pixel-art (some dull background aside), the game has modern approach to point-n-click adventurering. Mostly, you can't die and you can't get into dead end, so you can relax and enjoy it. From more interesting feature is inclusion of notebook in which you can combine facts, not intuitive though. It also doesn't have ability to use inventory items on something, making it easier to figure out, but still. Can combine items though. Once. Puzzles and plot are more related to each other and puzzles are less insane than in older quests, even has at least one 'aha!' moment. Well, almost. You still have to do things that normal person wouldn't see reason to do. Another annoying factor is main heroine's awkwardness, who is more clumpsy in socialization than any other person (funny, but it felt natural for me, as I have problems too. Aspenger's Syndrome simulator right there).  Also, to note is a music. Mostly electronical, it had moods and emotion and wasn't just bland. Not very memoriable either, but still excellent!  The plot is quite simple and introduces you to your sidekick and setting. Though half of it seems to be mostly about you wandering around with no objective, with second half finally getting to solving your first case of ghost, which you will handle like an amateur. It's still quite interesting, but it's not polished too well, you may want to abandon the game at some point. The game is also quite short, almost feels like an episode. So don't expect much. Doesn't feel to use the potential much. Best example is that the ability to combine items in inventory is used only once in whole game. It has amateruish feel too.  Another important part are extra. 2 developers commentaries modes and voice acting bloobers that you can activate after beating game. Fun. There is just 'Commentary' mode and then there is 'Anniversary commentary' mode or so. In both case the game will be randomly stopped to make you listen to it. They all lack subtitles though, shame.  Normal commentaries were made when the game came out, it mostly talks about developer's newfound experience with artists and voice acting, with a bit of game design here and there. Though it talks about voice acting more than I would want. 'Anniversary' mode was made after 10 years or so and is much more interesting. It's mostly about game design this time, more like, about developer blaming his own amateurness for deciding on weird things, as well as fwe things about updating engine. Fun stuff.  So, game is short, not brutal, has a beggining of plot. It's nice, I had fun, yet has flaws. But if you want to enjoy whole Blackwell plot then you will have to play each game. Even this one.",
