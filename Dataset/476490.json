Being a HUGE fan of their variety of games, and of pirates and their older title 'Choice of Broadsides' I was super excited to see this in my inbox. No spoilers, I promise.  Like all of their games, it's centered around text and your choices, in a semi-magical pirates themed world with you, member of a crew of a pirate (and pirate-hunter/treasure hunter), deciding what kind of future you want -- joining The Crown in hunting down pirate and wrong-doing, being a pirate yourself and maybe someday the Pirate King, or just amassing the biggest fleet and pile of booty you can before something does you in.  If you're a fan of the Choice of Games series and enjoyed Broadsides you might want to pick up a copy of Choice of the Pirates and have a bit of fun in a new adventure!",

In my perspective, Choice of Robots has a more interesting plot overall and definitely more branches to explore. This game is less involved and shorter overall but it's still a decent story to buy for the price.",

            "review_text": "I am glad this game is so cheap as I would have been much more salty about how short it was. I'd advise anyone from purchasing unless they were looking for something different to play. Choice of the Pirate is a game centered around your choices you make in the storyline that ultimately effects the plot in the end... I had a lot of fun choosing and reminding myself to be wary of what I choose... but I gotta say that some of the choices I made didn't really seem to bite me in the ♥♥♥ in the end at all. I never heard that character at all ever again after that choice I had made, and I was really expecting them to come back later on and try to stab me in the back for it. It didn't happen though, which was disappointing. I liked being able to pick out my signature clothing as a pirate, however that 'choice' seemed to be purely asthetic... I created my own piece of clothing and I expected the game to sorta 'substitute' my choice within the conversation when it came to that point but it never happened. A lot of the characters in the game are meaningless and you won't really need to remember their names since you'll only interact with them two different times out of the whole playthrough. The 'love interest' really isn't interesting. After hooking up the relationship really isn't brought back up in the story at all until the epilogue in the ending. Another thing, the whole 'pirate king' title barer is a mystery.... but.... it's not... the story makes it painfully obvious from the very beginning who the pirate king really is..",
