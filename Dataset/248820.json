            "review_text": "Where do you begin with a game like Risk of Rain? It's so new and original, yet so classic and oddly memorable that we can all adapt to it rather quickly while not feeling like we're repeating something playing it. Most 'pixel games' as they call them I see now are simply normal games... with pixel-y art styles. This is one of those games that actually blends well with the art style, and I wouldn't have it any other way. Let's talk about gameplay for a sec.  Gameplay: Risk of Rain will kill on your first run. If this does not happen, you are probably a carrier of Jesus' will and strength on Earth, because it's pretty dang hard to pick up on your first go. But to help, I'll elaborate on just how NOT to die. You are given the Commando to start out with, and classes like the Bandit, Enforcer, and CHEF will be easy to get early on. Every character has 4 skills, kind of like LoL, except you don't have a basic attack outside of them - They're all you got. Most classes tend to have a movement-enhancing skill in their third slot, and a powerful skill in their fourth. The Commando is no exception. He has 4 basic skills which are very easy to learn and starts with above-average high health to help beginners.  Unlocking Stuff: Unlocking stuff isn't as easy as you would think. You're probably going to start on Drizzle, the easiest game mode. However, if you're a wimp, the game won't save any of your progress (This includes item logs), and no monster logs will drop either. If you want 100% completion, you're going to have to step it up. Most characters are unlocked by doing special things or filling requirements. No surprise there. The Huntress and Mercenary are pretty hard to get, asking for 15 monster logs and 5 game-wins, respectively. But don't worry - You'll get there if you like the game.  Items and YOU: Items are, without a doubt, THE most key tool you need to survive the night. When you start out, you will find items randomly from boss kills, chests, imp vases, shrines, and other places. Chests require money, imp vases require you to hunt down and kill a few frantic imps, shrines are like casinos, and bosses should be obvious - Kill em for good stuff. Most (Keyword - Most) items can stack. A few, like Thallium, can not. This is why the RoR Wiki is your field guide for items here. Items give you various buffs and bonuses, and have the power to make or break you depending on how you use them and your luck with finding items that suit you. Once you start picking up Artifacts, hidden items that you can activate to change gameplay once you die, quit, or win, can alter some things - But I'll let you figure that all out.  Difficulty: There's two ways this game changes difficulty - One, by choosing your difficulty on the character-select screen, and two, by slowly raising it during gameplay at a speed dependant on what difficulty you chose. This makes for very adjustable learning curves that will suit you everywhere. Artifacts can also help or hinder you if you're good at using them or not, for example; The Glass artifact cuts your health to 10%, but gives you a HUGE damage boost (Used to be x5 damage but they nerfed it, I have no idea what it is now - Don't worry, it's still fun as heck if you don't get hit!). Remember to start and progress at a rate that you're comfortable with, or else you might not have as much fun.  Conclusion: Oh yes, this is a game you need. Don't even ask why, just get it. It's 10 bucks. It's awesome. Once you know how to use and abuse the artifacts and characters, you'll pretty much be playing something like a God Simulator with every run, finding new ways to use your characters, match items, and have fun with MULTIPLAYER - That's right, MULTIPLAYER! Also, achievements in the form of READING AND KNOWLEDGE! Also, THE GAME LAUGHS AT YOU WHEN YOU DIE and gives SNARKY REMARKS! The art-style is AMAZING! The music is AMAZING! The gameplay is BONKERS RADICAMAZING TIMES TEN! Just! Get! This! Game!",

I mean, the retro graphics are amazing and give the game a nice feeling, the different classes are really fun to play, the soundtrack kicks ♥♥♥, it's 100% worth the 70+ hours I've spent on it.  But the only problem is that this doesn't have 'matchmaking' multiplayer or a in-game server list. You'll have to either use portforwarding or programs such as Hamachi or Evolve. I don't blame the devs for that, though. They are college students, not Bethesda or Ubisoft. They've got actual problems in their lifes to take care of, and this is just their little experiment that turned out right. They still release bugfixes from time to time, though.  Anyway, 9.99/10 would slice magma worms with kitchen knives while hiding between a 100-feet-wide electric shield and 2 stacks of alien heads on my face again.  EDIT: As of January 2016, the site that had a useful list of servers I posted here doesn't work anymore! You can still try searching for people to play with in places like Steam community forums, Evolve, Reddit or whatever, though.",

            "review_text": "The longer you stay on this hellhole of a planet, the tougher things will get.  But you're stranded. So. Please start moving.  The inherit challenge of Risk of Rain is to balance speed with thoroughness. Dwell any particular region longer and you're bound to discover (and be able to afford) an array of random weaponry which stacks together in clever ways, turning your hopeless vagrant into a prayed-for messiah. But there's that catch ... the longer you dwell in one zone, the more infernal the next will be. So as you fight simply to survive, you'll also be gauging time and charting hypothetical routes through the mysterious wasteland ... hoping to come across the right combination of moneys, chests and sacrificial totems in efficient order.  Aside from the planet's devious armory, your years on the frontier have supplied you with a certain set of skills. Regardless of your profession, these core skills usually take form in a weak-ish basic attack, a middling form of crowd control, some type of evasion, and a signature ability (think of this as the one that won you all that money on The Universe's Got Talent: Killing Edition). Each time you use a skill - beyond the basic attack - you'll have to wait a few seconds before you can use it again. As that one random monster crab is quickly joined by every casual acquiantance from his apparently quite-social life, those seconds can seem like an eternity. But you'll need to use those skills with abandon - conservation is for another time and place.  Again. Don't stop.  As your deaths accumulate, Risk of Rain becomes a game about learning the ins-and-outs of an alien frontier while constantly pushing yourself to discover new corners of its relentless universe.   Your only choice of profession at the start is a fine-tuned but vanilla-bean commando. But just as you begin to master your skills, you'll unlock a new, entirely unique character to possibly nudge your game progress further. Trust those who have come before: The new characters will often feel useless on the first playthrough. At some point, you'll wrap your brain around the death-delivering potential of each. And as you pour gallons of acid across shadowy plains or single-shot the entire health bar of one of the game's gargantuan bosses, you will learn to feel invincible ... for a minute or two at least.  Each of the planet's progressively elaborate environments includes a familiar basic layout from play to play, but its random generation makes each play just uncomfortable enough to force you to make decisions on the fly. Level talk is boring, but do note: the surprisingly elaborate final stage is reward in itself.  Risk of Rain is a game that requires skill and cunning ... but not so much skill and cunning to be abusive. It drops a torrent of challenges on you ... while giving you delightful ways to overcome them. To this survivor: It's earned a place in the Roguelike Temple of Elders.  Be sure to visit.  Just remember to keep moving.",

            "review_text": "As one of my favorite games, Risk of Rain is highly recommended.  Most modern gamers will be confused by the graphic, but honestly if this game is built 2.5D in Cry Engine your game will crash so bad, my point: the gameplay is the most important part you should be looking at. Risk of Rain can be very addicted, everytime you start from the beginning with default data and you work your way to become a badass and with the new (kind of new) artifacts system, this game generate so much varieties that I can not count. Basically you chose one of the unique characters blaze through every stage and stock items, level up and build up your character and the objective is to beat the final stage.   One of the main features is the game's difficulty, it grows as the time pass. A decent gameplay management is required as the game can be tough to beat for a new player. RoR will keep surprising you with new contents (characters, items) that you will unlock, varieties tend to increase as you explore more. Which keep a well loop and create a high 'replayability'. RoR also contains several small secrets waiting for you to discover.  I have seen people complaining about the multiplayer experience, which was tough to me as well. Since the developers of RoR are independent developers, a server can be luxury indeed. Simply learn how to port forwarding will be enough to host. No hamachi required, I can prove it myself but who ever is hosting need a decent internet efficiency.   Despite lack of official server (some people actually host servers look it up), RoR is a pick up and play, rogue like action game, with very intriguing item and character design, and it is constantly updating. I can't illustrate how frustrated I feel when the game beat me and some ironic words pop out mocking my failure, or how awesome and satisfied it can be, when I beat the game with tons of items I collected. In other word RoR provide really nice difficulty options where things can get nasty require you to pay some attentions in order to beat it, or you can just sit back, relax, enjoy the show.  If you are available to play co-op, co-op is not too different from single player, which just add some additional chaos on your screen. The soundtrack in RoR is another feature to enjoy, musics in the background certainly polish the game into a another level it is simply astonishing and perfect. You can find all the little details proving that there are people (devs) who care about their games, and it is tons of fun when you are relaxing and reading some introductions of the item you've been using in the game, as well as the monster logs. Sometimes the game can crash if data overloaded (because it's the nature of the game), or some minority bugs happen to get in your way but overall RoR is a must-have game, and trust me you need to go deeper to witness the sorrow of the rain.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Update: 2016/11/24  It has been years when this game released. I really hope for a series or a huge update, from the bottom of my heart I wish these devs don't cool down this game. At last I hope RoR can get a reward.",

            "review_text": "I went into this game knowing absolutely nothing about it other than the name, the cover art, and that it was an RPG rougelike. I've now invested over twenty hours into it and after I finish this review I'm probably going to go play more.   Risk of Rain is addictive. That's the word I've found myself describing it most as. It hits the perfect sweetspot of challenge, luck, and skill. There's a visceral sense of empowerment- every time you collect a new upgrade, you actively feel stronger. All the visual effects that pop up coupled with seeing your inventory stack along the bottom creates this really unique sense of progression, as eventually- with a bit of luck- you can reach a point where absolutely everything you touch is obliterated in a miasma of fire, metal, and spirituality. The upgrades are all nice and varied, every single one having a unique effect such as adding a new type of damage or a chance to fire an additional projectile or a new way to heal yourself. It's not like other rougelikes such as Binding of Isaac where there are a lot of items that drastically change how you play- all of them just add effects and bonuses, making you into a walking powerhouse that just gets bigger and badder as time goes on.   A typical run will be about an hour if you're going for straight completion to several if you're like me and go back to replay the earlier levels and stack as much gear as possible. The game gets crazier and crazier as you level up, and if you make it that far I recommend trying it at least once. I also recommend playing with a controller- the keyboard controls work for the early levels, but once things pick up it's too cumbersome to recommend. The levels do get a bit bland, as the layouts are reused and the environments are pretty but don't make much difference. The soundtrack is solid and atmospheric, and the art direction is absolutely top-notch. The writing is worth note, too- the descriptions of the items and monster logs have a personality I wasn't expecting. I got excited every time I found something new because I couldn't wait to read up on its history. And any game where I can feel a serious, grave attatchment to a protagonist who just weaponized a ukulele can be called a literary success.   If you like RPGs, buy Risk of Rain. It's dirt cheap, and has that special feeling of leveling up in spades. All the characters are wildly different and change up the core strategy in really unique ways, and there's tons to discover and unlock. It's some of the most fun I've had with any video game lately and I'm absolutely smitten.",

            "review_text": "Risk of Rain is a rogue-like that offers a few interesting twists on the genre, but utlimately this game doesn't give the player a compelling reason to keep going back into the rain-stained void. I'm going to keep this short and just discuss the two main design errors that kept me from enjoying this game.    The first strike against this game is that it has a very skewed difficulty skewing. As time progresses in Risk of Rain, the enemies grow in numbers and strength. The early portion of this timer makes for an exciting experience that forces the player to formulate a careful balance between farming and progressing through the initial levels. If the scaling maintained this logical, linear progression, Risk of Rain would be brilliant. The problem is that near the end of the timer enemy statistics are hyper-inflated to the point where the game becomes slow, dull, and almost impossible to survive. No matter how lucky or unlucky one is in their item drops, eventually they will reach a point where progress is slowed to a crawl due to insanely inflated HP pools and huge damage numbers. Here's the critical reason why this is so bad: Risk of Rain is a game about kiting. You must be able to whittle the horde as you kite across sections of each map, and when you can't effectively kill anything after multiple loops, things go badly. Difficulty can be punishing yet rewarding, or it can be merely punitive. Risk of Rain's difficulty starts as the former but quickly morphs into the latter. Either the enemies need to be slowed in their evolution, or the player needs better scaling ratios.   The other problem with the game is that a large portion of the character kits are badly designed for the engine in which they inhabit. Risk of Rain is a game mostly about kiting, but only a few of the characters' kits are actually able to do this with any efficacy. The varying roster brings a welcome diversity to the game, but any initial excitement about new characters quickly begins to fade once the player begins to realize that only about three characters are actually worth playing when attempting more difficult and longer runs. The developers seemed to have forgotten that the game requires constant kiting, and as a result you'll find throughout character diversity many kits that inhibit or restrict one's ability to kite, and the damage compensation for the restricted movement isn't nearly enough to make it worth the sacrifice. The Huntress is an example of a character that is designed with the game's core mechanics in mind. Her speed, fast cooldowns, and movement are unparalleled, and playing this character augments all of the postive aspects of the game. Kiting the flood of enemies is a rush and most mistakes can be assigned to player error. The Bandit is an example of a poorly designed character -- weak mobility, long cooldowns, and no true edge in damage. The Bandit either would need more movement or much higher damage ratios to be a character that is worthwhile. Perhaps many would argue that they enjoy this hieratic approach to character rosters -- and some might even enjoy the extra challenge of a poorly designed character -- but I would have liked to seen multiple playstyles designed around the mobility required in Risk of Rain.   There's a few other problems with the game, but those are the two main things that kept me from going back to it. The initial struggle of balancing farming v. progression was addicting and compelling, but this experience was quickly ruined by an atrociously designed end-game. The thrill of unlocking characters, too, was diminished once one understood that only three have well designed kits. It's an interesting game that will be exciting for a few hours, but if you've played other Rogue-likes, you'll soon see the design errors that hold it back from true greatness.",

Risk of Rain is an intense rogue like. The game play is fantastic classic 8/16 bit platformer action. You have four abilities to aid you in the journey of survival. Twelve different characters you can play. Three game modes that scale well, the easiest of which does not allow the saving of progress. Combine all this with TONS of items that offer passive and on use advantages. The item combos can get crazy, like in The Binding of Issac. AND if you get more than one of an item it will stack.   This game is great if you have only 15min to play or 5 hours to play. Easy to pick up and get the hang of, but difficult to master no doubt. If you are new to rogue like games this is a great intro to the genre. Overall I would rate this game 8/10. It is a must play for any rogue like fan.",

But once you get to a certain point you can literally stand go pop some popcorn grab a coke (or some Mtn Dew if U MLG) and watch as your enemies fall before you and you start raking in the dough. One thing that I do not like about this game though is the local co-op. While it is fun to play the screen doesn't split so when you try to go away from your partner you can't see yourself. So I would like to see a dynamic split screen where when go farther away from your partner the screen splits in half between you and when you get close enough you share the same screen (kinda like the new lego games).

            "review_text": "Risk of Rain. What a game. At first I was skepticle to try this game out being that I assumed it was just your average MOBA with some sort of twist to it like most games are nowadays. What you get is a lost soul stranded on a mysterious planet fighting for survival against a army of creatures that want nothing but your death. This game is intense, sweaty hands intense. You play as one out of eight character who's only like, 10 pixels tall against giant monsters that absolutely tower you while trying to fight off a horde of smaller monsters as well. You really do feel a sort of pressure on you while you play when you remember that the monsters only get stronger as time goes on, so you're left with the decision to scour the level for items or to just continue on before you become overpowered. This game is hard, it does not forgive and death will force you to start over, and I wouldn't have it any other way. This is a game for the skillful and the strong, anyone who can't face a good challenge will not survive long in this planet. I love the game. Since the game randomly generates the level to be different every time, you're contantly left guessing where the teleporter is. The wide assortment of items to attain is amazing as they all have different effects that help you in your survival, such as mushrooms that provide speedy healing or a rocket laucher that fires a barrage of missiles at your enemies. There are just so many possibilties that it you're constantly left playing the game over and over again because it's impossible to get the same playthrough twice. That leads me to another thing I love about the game, it's infinately replayable. Since there are so many items and characters you can unlock, it gets to be addicting as more of the game's content becomes avaliable. The Multiplayer mode is a complete blast. You would think that with teamwork, the game should be a breeze, but no. The more people are together at once, the more monsters come to rip you down. It's so much fun to combine you are your friend's unique abilities (assuming they all play different characters) and to coordinate together to survive as effectivly as possible. I always thought it was hilarious how sometimes your friends would get so desperate for items that they dive for every possible chest. Multiplayer adds a new layer of challenge as you now have decide to distrubute the random items evenly, or to have one man become the strongest and carry the rest of the team to survival.  Now it's time for the bad. While it's fun and absolutely crazy when you're trying to fight off the hordes of them, after the big masses are dead, you're left with a few stragglers hidden somewhere in some corner of the map which becomes a chore to hunt them all down. One complaint I have with the game is how luck based it is, which I suspect isn't unreasonable considering the nature of the game, it's frustrating to spend your limited resources on a chest only to get some item that wouldn't help at all. There is very little incentive to use the shrines as they have such a high chance for failure, I would only use them if I had excess money on my way to the teleporter. Multiplayer is a pain in the ♥♥♥ to set up. This game uses the system where you have to connect to a friend via IP address. This system is very outdated and has only been nothing but a pain to get working. I cannot open my ports if my life depended on it which leaves me utterly unable to host games, leaving me to depends on my friends to play multiplayer, it becomes quite an inconveience to type in IP addresses for every person. At the very least, there should be an option to copy paste.  Aside from those issues, this is an absolutely terrific game that deserves to be played at least once. It offers so much for the moddest price of $10. It's a real bargan to get so much play time from this game. Get it now!",

It's very deep and engaging, and once you've put some time into it it'll get its 'one more run' hooks into you deep. The problem is it doesn't put its best foot forward and it doesn't really teach you what to look for. The starting class, the Commando, is straight forward but his dodge ability takes a lot of time to really master. The second class, the Enforcer, is great for multiplayer but a little too slow and plodding for solo. I've found that the most interesting classes unlock through random event spawns in the later levels, but they're either out of the way or blend with the rest of the scenery so that you need to be right on top of them to get the button prompt and realize they're actually gameplay elements.   If you want to have fun solo with this game, my recommendation is that you set it to easy, unlock all of the classes, and then play it on normal.",

Hold on, let me try again.  *ahem*  Risk of Rain? Pfft, more like Certainty of Pain. Wait, no, that's crap. Hm, synonyms of certainty...inevitability...destiny? Destiny of Pain? That sure sounds dark, though. Although I guess it fits with the game...where was I going with this again?  Dammit, okay, so Risk of Rain is about an interplanetary cargo ship that gets attacked by aliens over a deserted planet. The ship crashes, and you, playing as one of about a dozen different classes, have to, with the help of the cargo you find scattered across the planet, defend yourself against the native creatures and find your way back to the ship. It's a 2D jumpey-shootey platformer that is kind of sort of roguelike-ish; the areas you go to are more or less random, with the locations of the teleporters and items - and the items themselves - being fully randomized, but each area has only a couple of variations. This is not a bad thing - once you play through an area enough times, it's easy to figure out the general layout, meaning that it's potentially easier to find the teleporter to the next area. This saves time, and in  Destiny of Pa  Risk of Rain, time is not on your side.  The longer you spend in the game, the harder the game gets. More enemies spawn more rapidly, the enemies become stronger and tougher, and at higher difficulties, boss enemies can spawn in the middle of a level, instead of only at the end. This not only keeps the game's difficulty up, but it also forces you as a player to keep moving forward. Do you farm enemies and search for items, or head straight for the teleporter to prevent the difficulty from rising any higher than it needs to?  The game also features both local and online co-op, which is great, but sadly both methods have their own problems. Getting online co-op to work requires more than passing knowledge of computers, and local has every player sharing one screen, which makes exploration difficult. When it works, though, it can be a blast - exploration and monster-killing become much easier with multiple people, and working in a team allows the more specialized classes, such as Sniper and Enforcer, to shine.  Risk of Rain has good controls (the game is perfectly playable with either a keyboard or a gamepad), plenty of things to unlock and discover, and a punishing difficulty level that keeps it from getting boring but is never discouraging. Even though you start with one basic (albeit well-rounded) class, the Commando, getting the other classes offers a nice challenge on top of the gameplay itself, and each class plays very differently from the rest. The game is a ton of fun and you should buy it.",

Risk of Rain starts out fairly easy, but as the timer increases, so does the difficulty. This means a 90 minute game will have bosses, elite units, and waves of other enemies swarming you as you try to reach the endgame. All of this and it has multiplayer. In my opinion the best parts about Risk of Rain are the numerous items you can find on each level and the high skill cap that may be intimidating to new players at first. But fear not, as this game is really fun once you figure out your playstyle and strategy to advance through the zones and reach the final boss.

I couldn't help myself and just went on playing with the purpose to reach 100% achievements, however stopped at 97% with few monster logs missing. It has an enormous replay value, which sadly ends once you unlock some artifacts (Kin, Glass, Command, Sacrifice) and items (infusion, chargefield generator).   Once you get them, starting on a lemurian map, grabbing early infusion and stacking on barbed wire soon makes you and unstoppable ball of death and after 30 minutes of farming you always beat monsoon regardless of the character choice.  That kinda killed the fun for me, as I couldn't just go back to the regular style of playing after trying that. All in all though, the point where you can possibly roll through the maps every time you play start after you've played for some 20 hours or so already (if you are fresh new to the game), probably less if you've played it before or read the wikis a lot.  Before that I still had lots of fun, trying to survive, which is not always that simple. If you play it the regular way, your every gameplay will be different, some items will make cleaning the levels a breeze, while other sets will push you to change your strategy in order to prevent your painful death. The graphics might be a little archaic, but I think it synergizes well with the game overall and it actually looks pretty neat. The background music is prefect as for a space survival game, it fits well with the atmosphere of being on another planet, alone. Another great thing about the game are the monster logs, which I found very well written and enjoyable to collect and read.  RoR doesn't escape few minor bugs like item containers (the always come in three and you can buy only one item) sometimes spawn all in the same place, so you can't even really see what you might get or some items not working properly sometimes (looking at you Imp Overlord's tentacle), but it's nothing gamebreaking. For me, the most annoying issue was the FPS rate in later stages of the game, I mean, I don't really have a gaming rig (yet), but for a game that doesn't involve any too complex graphics, I think it should run smoother rather than lowering my details to the minimum and the FPS rate dropping to 20-30 (which also affects the clock, so the in-game time is not the same a real life time).  Still, for such a low price, this game is well-worth buying. It costs like 3 euro, when there's a discount running, which is a funny price for the fun I've had, especially with the AAA games having 5-10 hours of gameplay with no replay value at the cost of 40 euros. I recommend it to everyone who likes games with roguelike elements and is a completionist freak like me.",

            "review_text": "Risk of Rain is definetely a hard one to review for me. I find it a rather frustrating game that I continually return to playing and I was left having a hard think on why that is, both in terms of the frustration and in terms of why I keep returning. Risk of Rain has been something of a mixed bag for me.  Someone looking at my other reviews - Teleglitch or SotS: The Pit - will see I'm no stranger to roguelike games and I quite enjoy them. I don't really find them usually too frustrating and they haven't really seen any ragequits. But Risk of Rain has. Why is that? I think it basically comes down to the fact that the feeling I get from the game is very much that the random nature of the game is such that if you do not get favourable drops pretty much fairly all the way through you're going to have a very difficult time even at the normal difficulty. This wouldn't be so bad if the easy difficulty didn't penalise you for using it - your progression is not saved when you use the easy mode. I'm of two minds when it comes to that difficulty. One one hand, the difficulty is one of the definete genre staples of roguelikes. On the other hand, other roguelikes I've enjoyed had an element of definete skill to them whereby even with a poor random seed you can still get by if you are really, really good. Risk of Rain definetely feels exceptionally unforgiving in that random aspect. It's something to bear in mind. If you're looking for a more 'rogue light' experience, Risk of Rain is definetely not what you are looking for, but if you enjoy a challenge, I think you will probably find that attractive in Risk of Rain. It definetely has that in spades.  Speaking of difficulty, one of the more unique mechanics in Risk of Rain is the idea that the difficulty level increases across incremental levels as time elapses, whether or not you are active. This creates a paltiple tension and as much as I have my difficulty with the random aspect, this particular aspect is something I really like about the game. There is no rest break in this game, you have to keep going or something will murder you horribly, and that much definetely is a very roguelike thought indeed. I quite enjoy that part of it.  The biggest strength of the game lies in it's audiovisual style however. It has a very strong and fairly unique aesthetic that is well executed. I'm actually kind of sad there isn't a soundtrack DLC as I'd buy it in a heartbeat: the soundtrack is utterly captivating and very well composed. The game itself uses a very 'retro' pixel art style, but pulls it off well, and the art in some of the monster logs available through the menu are very well-done examples of that particular style. I just adore the aesthetic of the game, and when I sit and consider why I keep coming back, its to delve a little more into that world and the lore that surrounds it. It's strange for a roguelike but I get a definete feeling of exploration in learning the environment and it's lore.  All in all, it's a very difficult game so if you're looking for a more casual experience, I couldn't reccomend it, but if you enjoy a challenge to your game, Risk of Rain does indeed offer a challenging and carefully-crafted experience that you would be very silly to at least not give a spin.

Combine this with a hundred different powerups to collect which appear at random and a small amount of variability in the level progression and stage layouts and you've got a hard as nails game that's never exactly the same twice. A single playthrough is a mere six stages, but even after you reach the point where you can win reliably, there's still challenge to be had, with an extra hard Monsoon difficulty mode and a new game plus option that lets you skip the final stage and replay the game over and over, retaining your character but facing off against larger and larger hordes of tougher and tougher foes. Few gaming experiences I've had are as satisfying as starting out weak and fragile, but overcoming overwhelming odds to achieve nearly godlike levels of power. With enough items, you may find yourself able to stand uncaring in the middle of hordes of monsters, leap abitrarily high into the sky, or unleash piercing, explosive attacks that knock groups of enemies clean off the screen. This game is addictive, challenging, and extremely replayable, and I highly recommend it.",

It turned out to be not only one of my best sale purchases this holiday season, but one of the better games I have played in a long time.  It is essentially a hardcore roguelike styled action platformer, shortform and with huge amounts of replayability due to colectables, quite a wealth of characters with 4 different abilities each and a plethora of items to unlock and pick up.  - Story: There is not much of an initial story except for the opening cinematic, but as you unlock more characters and monster logs through the game more of the story is filled in. At no point was there a moment where I had to stop and look at the story so far, as it is an action platformer ultimately rather than some long winded fantasy sci-fi epic, but the way the devs have filled in bits of story via logs and such is quite well done.  - Sound: Music wise, the developers have chosen quite apt styles of music for the different stages, while creating an atmosphere that suits the gameplay and themes quite well. The sound effects are something else though; each enemy has an attacking noise, as do the weapons and powerups you accrue, and eventually you get to know the sounds of each. This doesn't sound like much, but in a game such as this these sounds are both well fitting and incredibly useful to keep track of enemies in your vicinity.  - Gameplay: I think of this as a side scrolling version of Binding of Isaac meets Super House of Dead Ninjas, with an added layer (or 40) of difficulty.Each playthrough is different and items per each run can make or break it for you, as they can in BoI. However, the mechanics and verticality are far more similar to SHoDN, with things being frantic on the screen most of the time. All of this combined makes the game quite fun to play through, and I highly recommend it.  As always, it is perhaps best to watch videos of the game before buying, and it is rather difficult alone. If you have a couple of friends to play with it is an absolute blast, and after you unlock a few things playing solo is also quite doable. As of yet I have not gotten to/beat the final stage/boss, but even after I have I will keep playing to unlock more items that become available. Definitely a recommended purchase.  This was my first reviews as well, hope it helps someone out there!",

            "review_text": "I would recommend to anyone whos likes a challenge and good things. Insanely fun and addicting. The soundtrack of this game is submersive and ominous, but the game gets really intense listening to your own music. Sound effects are retro but not annoying, you can almost feel the explosions hitting your enemies and the sounds of bullets hitting their flesh. I have never enjoyed the idea of perma-death but this game has opened up that genre to me, it does a great job of making you feel like ever playable charcter is different, and the speed at which the difficulty, as well as your own strength, on each playthrough provides for excellent fast-action that is really addicting. And on top of everything its online an local multiplayer! The atmosphere and small shreds of story we get from this game are excellent builing blocks for a game that question the human vs. nature relationship, this is built from assumptions incredibly sparce dialogue, and the tormented thoughts of a lone survivor adrift a hostile planet. While these intriguing elements of story and atmosphere are present, they are not so 'in-your-face,' rather, appearing in monster and item descriptions, these small attention to detail is immersive, interesting and not at all distracting of the core game. A perfect balance of incredibly strong replay value, and a good incentive to keep playing to unlock this worlds story, which we end up caring a lot about. The graffics are very charming and pleasing to the eye. No matter what of the 10 characters you play, your are always a small pile of about 30 pixels. Not to say that they were lazy at all, no. Rather, the simplicty and smallness of your charcter is great to look at and really makes your feel small in a world of things trying to kill you. The monsters are the same way, though they are larger than you(some very much so), they feel like true inhabitants of the world youve landed in. Bosses feel and look powerful and their deaths are satisfying. Graphically the world around you looks amazing, like the remnants of an ancient alien civilization. They really put you in concern with your characters need to survive. Overall, I give this game a 9/10. The reason not a perfect score is the only could use some tweaking. The difficulty, graphics, upgrades, items, collectables and secrets keep me coming back for more everytime I sit down to my computer. Never, have I put so many hours so quickly into a game that was inly $10. It was worth every cent twofold",

            "review_text": "Harkening back to the day of the 8 and 16-bit platformer, Risk of Rain is deliberately inscrutable roguelike that relishes in its masochistic difficulty curve. Skipping any kind of pretence of a tutorial or any of the modern hand-holding gamers have come to expect, your little spaceman is dropped into a random, semi-procedurally generated map with little more than the vague instructions to 'Find the Teleporter' to go on. Vicious monsters begin to spawn almost immediately and it doesn't take long to realize how hopelessly outmatched your little guy is, and it only gets worse from there.  The central conceit of Risk of Rain, and what makes it stand out from the pack of other recently released roguelikes, is the timer. A large clock in the top right of the screen mercilessly ticks upwards with every second. The longer you take, the more frequently the monsters spawn, and the stronger they grow. Every five minutes, a bell marks the passing into a higher level of difficulty, starting at 'Very Easy' and eventually tipping into the realm of 'impossible' and 'HAHAHAHAHA.' If you haven't been efficient at collecting upgrades and items, you may soon find yourself surrounded on all sides by monsters you don't have a prayer of defeating. The mission quickly turns from 'how far can I get?' to 'how long can I survive!?'  There is an incredible sense of urgency packed into every second of RoR because of that timer. Every choice and action becomes crucial. What way to you explore after spawning? Should you stay in this area and try to clear out enough monsters to earn enough gold to open another chest, or just book it while you can? While you only take miniscule fall damage, you'll be cursing yourself each time a missed jump forces you to reclimb a ladder, burning precious seconds.  As you might be familiar from games like  The Binding of Isaac , RoR features a plethora of items to be found. Most of these apply some kind of passive bonus to the character like a better chance for critical hits, a bonus to regenerating health, or a small demon in a jar that might cause enemies to explode when you kill them, you know, standard stuff. Others occupy the fifth slot in your inventory to be activated at will, usually with a tremendous cool down period before you can use it again. These are your typical screen-clearing bombs and the like, as well as more esoteric (and deceptively powerful) options like a Repair Kit that will instantly fix up any drones on the screen.  And much like  Isaac , part of the fun of the game is watching the strange transformation these items will wreak upon your tiny spaceman. You start as a small blip of pixels, a little speck that seems hopelessly outmatched by the towering wildlife and monstrous aliens. But all of that can change with a few lucky item drops. Wreathed in barbed wire, encircled by a fleet of drones, randomly spewing missiles, summoning poltergeists, and leaving a trail of fire at your boots, you may not even recognize your little explorer by the time you reach the final stage.  There are additional character classes to unlock. While you start with only the standard Commando in his adorable bubble-dome, it doesn't take long to expand the selection.  Each character naturally promotes a unique style of play with their skills. The Mercenary and Miner feature agile fast moving attacks that double as dodging manoeuvres, encouraging you to keep it hopping. The mechanical HAN-D robot on the other hand has a suite of moves designed to keep him in the thick of battle. An Overclock boost increases his speed and power and can be extended by pounding multiple enemies. His brawling prowess is complemented by an array of seeker drones that can autonomously fly off and leech back health from the enemy while he fights, and so on. Learning how to best utilize each character's tools and abilities is essential if you hope to weather the storm.  Multiplayer gives the individual characters a little more room to breathe and express themselves. Some of the more idiosyncratic classes that I thought were a bit lacklustre in single player came into their own with a team. I was worried that adding more players to the recipe would spoil the difficulty of the game. This is definitely not the case. While the extra firepower and the ability to split up and search for the exit certainly makes the early stages easier, having to share the loot and gold among 2-4 people means none of you will become the fearsome blackhole of alien destruction you might be used when hogging every trinket for yourself. By the final stages you'll need to work together as best you can to manage the laughably unfair hordes of nearly invulnerable monsters.  While playing with random strangers results in the typical mad scramble of greed you might be used to in something like  Borderlands  – where every player jumps on every item they can in a micro-demonstration of the Tragedy of the Commons – playing with a coordinated group raises the game to the next level. When you can actually coordinate who gets what items based on what they need or what would be most useful for a particular cast member, you can cultivate a truly spectacular team. Multiplayer goes from being a fun diversion, to feeling like it's the way the game is MEANT to be played.  Which is why it's such a shame that it is absolutely broken.  Connecting to an online game in Risk of Rain gave me some wonderful flashbacks of the late-90's. Eschewing any kind of server browser or quick-game connection UI, Risk of Rain expects you to manually input the IP and port number of your host. I haven't texted somebody an IP address in nearly a decade, and while the nostalgia trip was nice, it is a decidedly horrible way to run a multiplayer game.  It is an unbelievable shame that RoR's multiplayer is hamstrung in such a fundamental way. When I was able to find a match and everything worked, it was some of the best co-op I've played this year. It taps directly into the same impulses that made games like L4D and Gears of Wars Horde mode abiding favourites with my friends for years. Sadly, I don't think I'll be able to convince many people that putting up with all the frustration of getting a match together is worth it for RoR. I know Hopoo Games is a small group, but this was a real missed opportunity that could have taken their game from a being a fun little title to something great.  Risk of Rain is a sad game. It deals in desperation, in hopelessness. Rendered in a gorgeous faux-retro pixel-art style, everything in RoR dwarfs the player. The music, brilliantly composed by Chris Christodoulou, is tense, haunting, and worth the price of admission on its own. While RoR is intentionally light on story, the background of the game is slowly filled in through the shipping details of the items you scavenge throughout the game and a journal detailing the monsters and wildlife you encounter. Many of these little descriptions were surprisingly wistful or tragic, and by the time you've collected the last monster log, you'll probably start to feel like maybe you were the jerk in this situation.  That feeling helps carry the game. Risk of Rain isn't as smooth as something like  Isaac  or  Spelunky . There's more technical jank, items spawning in unreachable areas, containers floating off the ground, and the gameplay isn't as balanced or fair. Where part of the skill of  Isaac  or  Spelunky  is being able to roll with the punches and succeed despite bad luck, there were definitely times in RoR where I felt failure was out of my control.   But flaws notwithstanding, I kept comming back. That sad wistful tone and the wonderfully balanced characters just dug into the right spot of my brain.Risk of Rain might not be the most polished roguelike to hit the market in the last few years, but it has a charm all to its own, and I think that is a fact to celebrate.",

            "review_text": "I very much enjoyed Risk of Rain.   When I first got the game, with only the Commando as a playable character, I found it harder to enjoy.  The difficulty curve from the start put me off, and I didn't know (and still don't) how to play the Commando well, so I put it aside. After a while, however, I came back to it, and started to unlock more and more characters, which is when I realised that the sense of satisfaction as you climb through levels and acquire a veritable armory of items is very rewarding.   I feel that, skill aside, some characters are simply more effective than others, and that some of the in-game unlockable achievements are unrealistic (Activating the third teleporter without being hurt once just seems unrealistic for a more casual player), but those are the only negatives I can think of. The art style is perhaps left to preference, but I very much enjoy the simplicity and elegance in well-done pixel art, and find it very appealing.  Each character feels unique and plays unique, the simplicity of four skills combined with varying attack and movement speed lending to a completely different playstyle for every character, something that I feel is often lost in current games. The items, some more useful than others, all feel like they have distinct bonuses and different, from the Guardian Hearts to the Jetpacks and the Wicked Rings, and finding a higher-tier item feels rewarding and can immediately change your playstyle.  The levels are, perhaps, not that high in variety, but due to the adaptation in playstyle from each character and the multitude of items, they always feel like they play different. However, once all the characters have been unlocked, and all (or most of) the items, repitition kicks in: but this could be said for any game, so I won't count this as a negative.  All in all, a very enjoyable time waster, allowing for both quick games and intense playthroughs, the mechanics are rewarding, and utilising only four skills per character, they all feel and play wildly different.

Unfortunately, the level generation features only a handful of different layouts per zone, which makes each playthrough feel very much like the last. Varied enemies and classes break up the monotony very well, but, like playing with different action figures in the same sandbox, one begins to tire of the surroundings. The zoomed-out field of view and slow player movement give combat a sense of grandiosity and scale, but after a few hours of play that can easily transform into frustration of pace. Most characters and achievements can be unlocked on 'Drizzle' (easy) difficulty, which de-incentivizes playing on the harder difficulties. The types of items you find can also make or break a run, meaning that later levels are often either tedious (as you slowly chip away at enemy health) or boring (as you steamroll over them).   Risk of Rain is definitely a fun game, but for long-term enjoyment it stagnates as many small problems coagulate into a somewhat unrewarding experience.

At first it can be come pretty gruesome (Espically with the permadeath included), but as you progress you can see a dramtic increase how long you survive and unlock more things that increase gameplay such as charcters, artificats, and items.    In my opinion after a while I feel bored (slow) when going through a playthrough and when on the hardest diffuculty it feels like childplay (Even without playing the 'kiting god'), espically without any artifacts on. (But there's certain things that can ramp up the diffuculty of the game even more, if you know what I mean☻).   There's notable difference in some of the characters kits that I notice while playing 'Risk of Rain', that are sometimes better than other classes making things 'unbalance' in certain situations, if you play long enough to see in classes. Despite that all the classes their own charm in their respective kit and the 'unbalance' in certain situations, such as single player can add a challenge when you come back to risk of rain.   Some problems I have endured during my time in risk of rains are when i'm starting a new playthrough in single player and would fall out a map and would have to restart (dosen't bother me as much), and The multiplayer that sometimes likes to work and not (In my experinces). There's other bugs that never occured to me but to other people... Last level glitch,Crashing,etc that might be fixed as game updated recently (With a beta release even more back). If not people should report them the bugs in the respective areas.  But despite all that, be sure to get risk of rain ☻",

Crispy clean pixel graphics and fantastic music accompany this fun rogue-like platformer.

I like being the space-mailman.  The game is pretty hard at first, but you will really notice that you are becoming more skilled after playing for some rounds. You will unlock cool new items to use in later games as well as neat and unique characters! The items you will find are, of course, all randomly generated. You will have to adapt your playstyle ever so slightly depending on what items you find. That being said, it is possible to play well even if you are not really happy with your item-combos.   There is a bit of skill and know-how involved. Randomness and your own input and choices are well balanced.  At the last level, you will have the option of traveling to the boss of the game or re-visit previous levels.

The loot locations will always be diffrent, and somtimes some areas will be open, or closed. There is a lot of unlockibles, and 10 diffrent maps you will see and enjoy. The enimes are pretty diverse, each with a little lore log. The bosses are similar to terraria type bosses, but they change up the game when they start spawning normaly.   The whole game is set on a timer and the time you take fills up a difficulty metter. The 'easy,medium, hard' mode you pick when starting just changes how fast this meter fills up. When the meter fills up, things dont nessicasrly just start doing more damamge making 'artificial difficulty' but rather they start spawning more stronger enimiers, and more bosses.   This game is very easy if you know how to dodge, and how to monover each of the enimies. Honestly, I love playing this game, and it is very addicting. The only part I can complain about is that it does get laggy near the end of the game.  If you are on the fence about it, deffiently pick it up on a sale and try it out.

Guys did amazing job getting all the best together and Risk of Rain is a beautiful product, but pretty hardcore-ey - easy mode does not count any progress you made and is simply boring while normal mode goes way up so be prepared to have a tough start. Game is flexible and it requires you to be flexible as well. Do or die.  8/10 will play more  Bugs make some experience horrible.",

Retro City Rampage nailed that perfectly in my eyes. Frame rate drops are an annoyance and pretty much the fault of making a game on the Game Maker engine (I'm pretty sure, but not certain on that, and won't bother to google it ;).) Having the multiplayer,singleplayer (starting a multiplayer game and playing by yourself) Monsoon (hardest) difficulty being easier had me scratching my head, but it's a minor nitpick that I have.

This is also a fantastic addition to the games multiplayer component, which is a 2-4 player co-op mode. In this mode the players cooperates with up to 3 friends to complete the games levels. The players share both XP and money.  The game has a fantastic loot system, that adds both random effects and buffs to your character. These upgrades keeps the game fresh and fast paced, since every game is different. No other games seems to do exactly what this game does, and if they do, they are probably not as good.  The other interesting component to the game is the timer. The game features a leveling system wich power you up as you play through and kill monsters. This backside of this leveling is the timer, which keep you moving. As time goes on, the game becomes significantly harder if you stay in a place and farm money, XP and drops. This tactic is therefore ill advised.",

            "review_text": "Risk of Rain is an addicting and fun to play sort of beat-em up RPG which takes on some rouge-like qualities. The basic gameplay is killing seemingly randomly spawned enemies to acquire new items to become stronger and beat bosses until you progress to the final stage. This game has a story that while not the most prominent of features is still interesting in terms of lore. The items and monsters you come accross get catalogued and have individual descriptions which builds a somewhat deep world for the game to take place in. As you play the game more items and characters to play become unlocked. Unlockables are extremely motivating although some of them can be a bit difficult on normal mode and playing on easy mode is such a tremendous gap of difficulty that it sometimes makes the player feel cheated when choosing it. One of the reasons is that the separate difficulties directly effect the difficulty curve in the game. As you play the game automatically gets harder after set intervals. This is a unique and a well-done risk against reward mechanic, but I feel easy mode may make dilute it too much.  Risk of Rain's main gameplay is quite rewarding. As the initial starting class you can roll out of enemy danger-zones and shoot from afar. Many of the unlocked characters have their own unique gameplay style which can become quite interesting during multiplayer. Though some of the characters feel marginally less fun to play than others. On occasion a player may find themselves with a slow first level because the enemy spawing is quite sparatic initially. This can often lead to poor chance at later progression automatically. At the end of each level there is a boss fight which can range from very difficult to downright child's play. Sometimes bosses will spawn on a platfrom that the player can shoot from but the boss can't attack from. The boss fights are almost always exciting though and the boss and enemy variety throughout the game is large enough to where traversing the levels is seldom boring.  Overall, Risk of Rain is a fun game with rewarding gameplay. If you have friends to play the game gets even better. Some of the unlockables can be a bit tough, but easy mode will allow for smooth travels while unlocking new items and classes.  Risk of Rain receives 5 large potatoes out of 7.",

All in all, the items (and tons of unlockables) keep the game fresh when first starting out.  The game also boasts being one of the more challenging platformers. While your power level increases exponentially during your playthrough, the enemies become faster and stronger. There are no checkpoints, so if you die--you die permanently. With luck and a little bit of finesse, the game may be beaten, though.  It takes a little time to get used to, but this game is really addictive to its core.",

The way it starts you off small, with weak enemies, quickly progressing to become a literal monsoon; with souped up versions of the once weak advesaries you farmed money off of.The collection of items with unique properties in order to survive make every run for the most part a unique experience. A continually increasing difficulty based on how long you've spent in-game gives a sense of urgency, choosing between exploring for more items or leaving for the next area. The game instills a comedical nature at some parts, but also a dark depressing story aspect at others. Above all however I absolutely love the music as composed by Chris Christodoulou, especially the ending song which essentially summarizes the entire game's experiences.   The Single-player is for the most part easy as long as you play smart, playing with friends actually makes it a tad harder but that makes it all the more fun.

It's a lot of fun, items are extremely important and the RNG gods will decide your fate  Games start with you as a Commando who can shoot rapidly, dodge roll to evade all attacks, and has an ability to fire one shot that pierces all enemies. Games ends where every shot has a 35% chance to launch a mortar, 10% chance to fire bursts of missiles, every hit drains health, every kill summons a ghost to fight for you, and every 4th shot pierces all enemies and explodes. Oh, and you have a laser drone following you around  In a similar vein to FTL, in which every game is different enough that you'll play differently. Whether you're a life-stealing tank or a fast-moving kiter.  Overall, I thoroughly enjoy the game. It's an excellent game to spend some small amount of time on when you need a break. The action rises and falls quickly when you activate that teleporter and have to survive against hordes for 90 seconds before arriving in a new place where the enemies haven't yet shown up.

The flexibility greatly improves replayability, with characters like the Acrid: an acid-spewing alien who does damage over time. Compared to the Huntress, a swift, fragile archer who has the unique ability to move and attack at the same time.  The game is subject to Random-Number Generation (RNG) in that items are extremely important. You will end the game with close to a hundred items, 20-30 of which are unique to each other. Finding the right items early can make the game a breeze for a while, but finding the wrong ones can lead to a swift death. It's all about flexibility, and adapting to the items you find ",

            "review_text": "If you're debating on whether or not to pick this game up, I can assuage those doubts of yours. Before buying this I spent at least 30 hours in the game going through levels over and over again, trying to unlock those last few items (and this was before artifacts were added).   Risk of Rain is a skill based side-scrolling action game where your main objective is to find the teleporter in each level. Once the teleporter is found, however, a countdown starts where you must stay alive until it finishes, a task made all the more difficult due to the boss monster that spawns as soon as you activate the teleporter. The game falls into a good rhythm: find the teleporter, kill the boss/enemies, go to the next level. Of course there are mechanics that add a bit of complexity to it, such as the items that can be found for sale around the level, the ever increasing difficulty level, and the variety of levels. The game features permadeath, as no characters can keep their levels once dead. However, new items, characters, and artifacts can be unlocked for subsequent playthroughs through completing the game's challenges, which range from somewhat simple to, at times, ridiculous, and finding hidden items throughout the levels. It is in this way that Risk of Rain gives the player a feeling of progression even after the loss of all the avatar's levels after death.  The items found in the game can be purchased by money dropped by defeated monsters. These items increase your survivability in a myriad of ways, but the downside is that there is no explanation of what the item does when you purchase it. Players who come across one of the game's 'Item Shops' (which are really just three items next to each other, two of which will disappear when one of them is bought) will only have the small picture of the item to give them some clue as to what it does. While some might find it frustrating at first, I liked the fact that there is no explanation, as it immerses the player into the situation of their avatar, stumbling across some strange object in a foreign planet where nothing is familiar and hoping it helps them survive the hordes of ever-looming alien creatures. All the pictures of the items are clearly discernable, however, and on subsequent playthroughs of the game the player will become intimately familiar with the items.  There are quite a few unlockable characters, and players will unlock some of them just by completing the levels in the game. A choice few, however, can be found in certain hidden spots throughout the levels. Each character has a different enough playstyle than the rest, and while some of the make the game a little too easy I believe that helps the new player learn the levels before going at another playthrough with a different character.  While the player can spend as much time as they need to on a level, there is a downside to spending too much time in one place. In the top right the player can see what looks like a thermometer, which represents the current difficulty level in the game. Every few minutes the difficulty level goes up, which means that more monsters will spawn, more elite (tougher) monsters will spawn, and every item will be more expensive with each new difficulty level. While I'm not a fan of timers, this does add a new time management dimension to the experience. By not penalizing the player with death for taking more time than needed and instead increasing the difficulty, the game opens up new strategies for players to interact with the game. For example, some players spend as little time as possible on the first level, as this means the later levels will be a bit easier and (more importantly) items will be cheaper. However, some spend up to five minutes on this level, as they want to get all of the items on the level so they can be better equipped for the next levels. More monsters also means more experience and money, so if the player's skill level is high enough they can intentionally spend more time than needed in order to force more monsters to spawn and level up even more.  The levels in the game are sprawling and visually attractive. Instead of forcing you to go to one level every playthrough, the game randomly picks from two levels. For example, for Level One there are two options (Worlds 1-1 and 1-2), for Level 2 there are also two options (2-1 and 2-2) and the same can be said for Level 3. Levels 4 and 5 are the same, however, but because of the variety in the first three levels it feels less grating on multiple playthroughs as the player does not know exactly what to expect.  There are also collectables to get in the levels that randomly drop. One such collectable is a monster log, which has a low chance of dropping when you kill a certain monster. This collectable unlocks some art and a description of the monster in the main title screen. The more interesting collectibles (gameplay-wise at least) are the artifacts, which will randomly appear throughout the levels. On getting these artifacts, you are able to activate them on subsequent playthoughs to make the game even harder.  Risk of Rain is an excellent game in all respects. The only flaws I can find in it are the soundtrack (which is good at times but not as great as others have told me it was) and the fact that getting online co-op to work is a chore (I mostly play single player though). The visual style is aesthetically pleasing (I especially liked the boss designs) and controls are tight and responsive. Definitely worth the money considering the time you can put into it.",

All of that packaged together makes for some FUUUUN TIMES. Risk of Rain manages to feel new and exciting through multiple playthroughs and with each of those playthroughs being fairly short, it doesn't necessitate a person to dedicate a huge chunk of time finishing the game.  There are things that warrant polish however. Some of the classes are much better than others, I think a few tweaks in the numbers department would balance the issue. The Multiplayer could use some additions, like being able to kick someone from your server, having a server save list, and being able to see a selected class's abilities during the selection screen are a few I can think of.  Overall, Risk of Rain is a nostalgic, quick blast of fun well worth it when... Steam has it on sale. 7.5/10",

This makes prgressing to the next level very intense knowing that your next move may kill you and make you loose all progress. The game gives gold for killing enemies found on this very strange planet. This gold can be used to open chests found in game. Inside these chests you'll find a massive variety of items which will buff your character for the duration of the world. This gives the player the chance to get a massive amount of items at once if many chests are opened allowing your character to become a monster killing machine. Although the game can be beat in maybe 40 minutes it will take lots of practice to master the skills of your character and make it to this point. at the end of every level there is a massive boss for you to take on which offers some crazy gameplay, because while the bossfight is going on there are still tons of enemies trying to kick your butt.

The co-op is awesome, and really rewards you for skillful play.  A few issues with the resolution, and a few minor bugs while playing co-op sneak their way in once in a while, but I usually forget about it once the amazing soundtrack kicks in. The music, and sound effects are superb.  My only gripe, is that maybe the graphics coulda been slightly upgraded from what they are. While they are servicable and work, something more along the lines of Super Meat Boy graphics would have suited it more. Overall though, I reccomend this game to anyone that loves action, randomness, and a high risk vs reward system. 9/10 for sure.",

There's a screen shot up there with 92 minutes on it, my personal best is probably less than 15 minutes due to very very lucky item drops making me nigh-unkillable. ('nigh-' being the operative word there. There's always a way...)  But that's okay. Death is expected, and it's very easy to just hit 'play again' and charge straight back in.

Do not get me wrong this game is huge fun, playing until you reach the difficulty 'HAHAHAHAHAHA' After 'I see you' and 'I am coming for you' is just awesome, so many numbers and so much action on the screan is just great, The rougelike elements are awesome too.  BUT if you reached stage X with 120 Minutes in game and the game says 'FATAL ERROR' well this is the moment when you think 'OK this is not that bad I will just restart the game' But you will realize verysoon that EVERY Item, every Log, every Char you have unlocked, JUST FREAKING EVERYTHING is gone. Even if you have unlocked the Achievement in Steam.... (The Bug only apears in Multiplayer for me)  I will explain why only 33 / 100:  Gameplay: 90 / 100  Soundtrack: 100 / 100 Unlocks: 100 / 100 Achievements: 95 / 100 Tasks: 100 / 100 Gameplay Elements: 99 / 100 No Tutorial: 100 / 100 Overall Game: 689 / 700 (98,42 %)  So I can say that this is probably the game I had the most fun in this year. But the Bug.....  Being forces to play something again and again just to unlock something that you have already unlocked sucks. Or at least being forced to solve this Bug that is in the game since 2013 is just not acceptable! That is the why I have given this game: 98% - 65% = 33%  Great game but a fun taking and game breaking bug",

I love this game; it is a true gem and a fantastic game worthy of playing. Every run is a thrill, and every moment is hectic and overall a blast. This is a superb roguelike game, with great progression and class variety; the only issue I can see ios that, with the right items, you can stomp so hard the ighest difficulty is still next to no trouble, especially if you collect the Artefact which lets you choose what item you get from chests.  Upon beating the final boss, Providence, and reading his Monster Log entry it leaves a lot of unanswered questions... It makes you question whether your arrival on the planet was an accident or not, as the game pointws out your ship has a teleporter to the planets surface. Almost all of the bosses aside from maybe 2 or 3 are described as 'protector' or 'guardian', which really makes you think. Even Providence themselves are called 'The Bulwark of the Weak', presenting them as more of a hero than villain.   It isn't the story of a valiant human survivor of a sabotaged ship; it's the story of an ignorant mass murderer. 9/10. I hope there's more updates or content from these developers.

The game does a very good job of keeping focus on your player character. The game has a large vareity of enemies, weapons, and items. The game's dynamic changes drasticly when you use one of the other unlockable characters, each with farily unique abilities and play styles. My only complaint is that there are some bugs that show up sometimes where the world doesn't have propper collision and you just fall through the whole level, requiring a restart. This can happen on a per player basis in multiplayer as well, where just one player can end up with no collision in the world. Lukly this doesn't happen that often but I hope it gets fixed. Annother complaint is that despite of the perceduarlly generated levels, there are still too large of sections of the level that look the same as it did in other play throughs, there isn't enough vareity.",

You can level up your character making him or her stronger and faster, you can aquire various items with hindering buffs to take alien monsters down quickly and just generally progress character wise. But as you play on towards the level boss, the difficulty increases. So you're juggling a 'do I take my low level items against an easier boss or become fully kitted out but fight a much harder to win battle?' mindset. This makes the whole experience incredibly dynamic and enjoyable. It's tense and rather exhilerating at points. I think the game shines during multiplayer sessions (while a pain in the ♥♥♥ to set up) having you and your friends tackle increasingly difficult levels. bossess and interesting monsters is just plain awesome. The game has character. A breath of fresh air from your standard triple A titles I suppose. It is by no means a casual game though. Risk of Rain is brutally hard and immensely punishing. It is also highly highly rewarding and undoubtedly fun. I'd highly recommend picking it up, especially for the price. Oh and the soundtrack is perhaps one of the coolest OST's I've heard yet.

The game is heavily centered around the gameplay aspect, putting story to the wayside (for the most part). You select a character almost immediately after starting up the game and begin jumping, dodging, shooting and picking up all kinds of upgrades. The pickups and unlockables make the game well worth coming back to even after you've beaten it, and the ability to play with friends adds an infinite degree of replayability. It's got everything I could ask for in a game: - Can be picked up and played for short periods of time and very quickly - Challenging and engrossing gameplay - Nice art style - Great soundtrack - Serious replayability - Controller support - Multiplayer And so on. Even though it's a game for ants, the small size of the characters on-screen never detracts from the experience. In fact, it adds to it! Since (nearly) all characters fire projectiles, being able to see a wide margin to both left and right helps to maintain some kind of idea regarding the behavior and location of the enemies on screen. It can get a bit frantic at times, and I almost never know how I died (which happens a lot) until I see the game over screen. Playing with friends is a blast. Playing alone is a blast. It doesn't matter. This game is definitely worth its low price point.",

Namely, every menu is 100% navigable with a controller now. Slight tweaks to the graphics and some background functions (they mentioned fixing a rounding error in the patch notes that would cause some weird placement of mobs and your character) smooth out the gameplay a little more.   I don't know what it is about games that have the main goal of killing you that attracts me so, but Risk of Rain is an amazing randomly-generated platformer that is balls-♥♥♥ hard and unforgiving in its presentation. The graphics harken back to a time when dynamically rendered shadows, tressFX, and millions of polygons per model weren't the only important thing in games, and they fit the gameplay quite nicely. There's something about the pixelated quality of the graphics that adds even more anxiety to playing RoR, and it could be something as simple as you never get a clear 'picture' of what your enemies are and as such, your imagination can run wild filling in the details. Like most permadeath random-generated (I'm refraining from using the term rogue-like or any of its counterparts, because the game is not a rogue-like) games, the longer you play RoR, the better you get at surviving and using the environment to your advantage.",

The game features an assortment of classes, which gradually unlock as you default challenges within the game. The classes change how you interact with the levels, and provide additional replayability on top of what is already a compelling game.  Basic gameplay involves simple combat, exploration, and tradeoff choices in how to spend your resources. There are boatloads of upgrades of various rarities, many of which are stackable which can be anything from a minor boost, to a hugely impacting laser sweep or exploding enemies.   There's a constant time pressure, as the random encounter difficulty scales up the longer you play. So while you may find yourself tempted to just park and farm on a particular low level, even that will eventually become uncomfortable, and the next level will be brutal because of it. You either rush forward, and content yourself with fewer items but a better your level : monster level ratio, or take it slow and fight better equipped against harder foes. It is well balanced and makes for a good tradeoff.  Each level type contains a distinct set of enemies, with randomized placement and individual feature tweaks. The game has lots of challenges which unlock new dropped items, gameplay modifiers (usually tradeoffs that you can decide to play with), and classes.  I admit I'm one of those people who generally feels a game is complete when I've unlocked every achievement for the game. Risk of Rain is one of those games that even after I have long since done this, I still find myself picking it up to play randomly regardless.",

It only registers your unlocks, achievements and new scores when the run ends, when you die, give up or win. It should at the very least save your progress after every stage, and let you continue from the start of the stage but to be safe should save after every important unlock.  I bought the game a while ago but only started getting into it recently. I had tons of fun with it until it started crashing. Having to again unlock all the characters and artifacts which require lucky item drops and level generation is more of a hassle than it is fun.

At first I wanted to quit for good because it was just too frustrating, but I found out that you just have to get through the first two stages and hope you get some of the better items before you get deeper into the game. That and it is crucial to find the floating bots and repair them to help you out. After I had the bots helping me, my weapon and skills started to become so ineffectual that the bots were easily accounting for at least 95% of my dmg output. It got to a point where there were so many enemies and they took so much dmg that without any bots helping me the game would actually be unbeatable. The game's main problem is that when you get to the third stage, the ice stage usually, the difficulty spikes to unacceptably hard. I triggered the boss and of course other things spawn in when he is there so since it was the colossus I was able to take them away from him and focus on them. Problem is in that level because of the difficulty spike they take too much dmg to kill, are too many of them, and were shooting undodge-able projectiles which killed me in a few hits. So if I have to clear not only the boss but also all of the enemies but they made it impossible on that part and screwed me over purposely, why even make a ♥♥♥♥ing game in the first place? That is as of 2015. I beat the game back in 2014 and honestly can't even believe I beat it as impossible as that level is.  I unlocked the enforcer, the bandit, the sniper, the engineer, and the huntress. Besides the engineer and huntress, they all sucked and seemed more like backup classes for online play. The thing that stands out most about the game is its killer soundtrack. A very unique indie game. I've never seen anything like it and it is a blast.  I would complain about it only being three hours long or less but since I got this free in a mass giveaway a long time ago, I can't. But I would say that because of how short it is and there not being really any real replay value, catch this only on a big discount. If they make a sequel, it could benefit from being less frustrating and longer and make the other classes besides commando, engineer, and huntress actually playable without dying instantly.",

            "review_text": "After playing many rougelikes, the main one being 'The Binding of isaac' I felt inclined to purchase 'Risk of Rain'  It advertised itself as a combat-based 2D Action game, this didn't dissapoint in any of those aspects.  Visuals 6.5/10 The visuals in this game are its weakest point, I can understand the pixel-based art style and have nothing against this. Destpite this I find the visuals to be rather bland, the reason for this being that there is a lack of colour in the game, or more importantly lack of using colours to make the game look appealing to the eye.  There is alot of missed oppertunities when it comes to the overall visual design of the game, I feel that lighting effects similiar to terraria could have been used to brighten up the game. Monster design also doesn't fit certian levels. Despite having mobs that are clearly designed for certian levels, it gets a bit wierd having mobs that don't fit the current level. Apart from that the visuals are functional and at some points in the game work very well, they just need to be more consistant for the most part.  Soundtrack 9/10 The soundtrack used in this game is simply put - fantastic -  The music in the game is great, for the most part it mainly consists of ambient tracks with a chiptune feel. In certian levels and in boss battles, the music ramps up. Mostly being heavy rock-inspired chip tunes giving a rather epic air to the game, giving an emotion similiar '♥♥♥♥ yeah' to the player.  Level Design 7/10  The levels in the game are rather solid for the most part, whether it is a deserted grassland, or a cave infested with monsters. The only issue I have with the levels are, unlike most rouguelikes, the levels are not random. The loot inside each level is randomly placed, but the actual layout of the levels does not change. This degrades some of the fun of replaying the game, but hopefully, this aspect will not bother you too much. The levels work, but there are some areas that are a little 'dodgy' when it comes to platform placement. I understand that you need certian characters to reach certian places, but even with the correct character, it can be difficult to reach said platform, with a bit of tweaking this can be easily fixed and hopefully it will.  Gameplay 8.5/10 The combat system is one of the outstanding points of the game, following a similiar model to most MOBA titles such as DotA or League of Legends. It works by having 4 abilities that can be activated on a button press, as well as useable items that can be found throughout the level, each ability is unique and each ability set is different for each character. Oddly enough, this combat system fits suprisingly well for this genre of game requiring skill and timing of abilities to keep yourself alive. The loot in the game is rather well done, having several items, all of which unique. Giving the player passive or active affects, The only issue being that there is not enough types of items (or so I've seen throughout my overall time spent in the game) most of the items being stat boosts unfotunatley. There is many fun items to use, such as the 'Missile Launcher', 'Ukulele' and 'Will 'o the Whisp' These items give rather interesting effects that are fun to work with, making it feel like everything around you is powerless against you. Unfortunatley there isn't enough interesting items like the ones mentioned most I've encountered are things like 'increased movespeed' or 'chance to make enemies bleed' although effective, it makes the game feel repetitive and boring. The only other complaint I have is the platforming feels slow and clunky, having characters that feel heavy and are poor at jumping.  Overall 7.75/10 A really strong game that I would reccomend highly to fans of the genre only downsides being level design and visuals that are annoying throughout.",

When you first start off, you may be like 'Pshh, there is only like 5 enemies, how could this possibly be bad?' but the moment 4 Collossi stomp on you at once and your character gets blasted upwards, do you realize how wrong you were. This game has 3 gamemodes, 12 characters (each wonderfully thought out), over 100 items, minimalistic but interesting story, and 10 artifacts to further change up the game. Needless to say, there is quite a large amount of replayability. This game also has a kind of gimmick, if you will. As time increases, so does your difficulty. This feature prevents farming as items are the most helpful thing in the game but only so many spawn on each level, forcing you to leave it sooner rather than later. You have to survive through about 4 or 5 (i forget) levels until you can go to the last one, which is your crashed ship from the opening 'cinematic'. Risk of Rain's art style is nothing to write home about, but it gets the job done and is actually kind of awesome at some points (only a very few select points.) There are also a large amount of items to be unlocked so even if you beat the game 100 times, you may not have unlocked everything, giving you bigger goals.  tl;dr there is a lot of stuff to do in this game and difficulty increases as time does.

I'd recommend this game to anyone who likes Spelunky and Binding of Isaac. It is just enough random to make every run different while not overdoing it and making it feel impossible. One thing I love about this game that is hard to say about a lot of roguelikes is that when I die, it's my fault. I messed up somewhere and that is powerful, that puts the hook in you baiting you telling you to do better.  Visuals are what they are, if you see screenshots you get what you see I personally think they could be a little sharper but they don't detract from the game and more importantly they NEVER overcomplicate things which can be a problem in other games.   What about the sound? Oh god the sound, just listen to the soundtrack and tell me you don't want to be blastin baddies on an alien homeworld. The gameplay, well it's hard to describe. It's a lot of Dip Duck Dodge Dive Duck whatever else their's is and a lot of strategic use of cooldowns. It's really well done and I only have 3 characters (All of which feel very different.)  TL:DR? All in all I'd say go buy this game right now. Seriously buy it. Stop reading. Buy. Go to steam. Purchase. Enjoy.",

Wasn't really enjoyable grinding all that ♥♥♥♥ on a character I didn't like to play, but I do see that it could be fun to work to unlock the fun ones... I guess.  Also, this game comes off as buggy. There are item and monster diary things, but it's not really clear how you unlock them so to speak. They just seem to pop up whenever they feel like it. Also the stat tracker thing. I've played like 10 characters all the way through, it it's still like, 'You've played this guy once for 10 hours' and no, not really, I haven't.",

I've never got so much of a sense of acomplishment from unlocking things or beating a game as I did this one.   A con I can think of is it is not *AS* fun solo as it is with some friends.  And also sometimes the UI will cover the player   Pros:  *Rougue like  *Super hard yet not frusterating  *Many charecters all with very well made abilities  *Many unique items like you have not seen in other games (War banner, get it early and set up a fort)  *Local coop, for a guy with sucky internet, either LAN or local coop is fantastic. If a company wants to make it so I have to buy four copies fine but at least let me have local play  *Tons of enemies  *Crazy intense  *Great replayability  Cons:  -Solo is not as fun (As with most games)  -A few items that suck (Gold plated bomb)  -UI can cover the player sometimes (Not a big deal)  -Shared gold with team (Only sucks if you have a jerk on your team)   Buy this game, its cheap and it WILL become one of your favorites.

The variety of characters to unlock and play, with different playstyles, make the experience feel fresh and amazing everytime you play through the game. The difficulty increases the longer you play in-game and keeps the game from being boring -- this is my personal favorite feature of RoR. As you collect and unlock all of the various items and gain experience, you slowly watch your character turn from a simple class character to an unstoppable killing machine that destroys all of your enemies. As you progress, you want to survive as long as you can so you don't lose what you've earned with the permanent death feature. The designs of the enemies and bosses, character powers and the absolute mass destruction, all of these features contribute to the enjoyable time that I've experienced in this game. All of this AND the multiplayer function to play with friends? I can't ask for a more incredibly amazing and enjoyable platformer. I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes action platformers and to become the most badass mf with godlike powers.",

The reason I gave this game a negative review is because it lacked in the one area that I really hoped would've worked, the multiplayer. No lie I was pretty excited to find a rougue-like with an online multi-player system in the game becuase I was disappointed by many other popular rougue-like titles not really exploring the concept of online multiplayer (binding of isaac/ enter the gundgeon). This game is one of those port forward type multiplayers where supposedly you can use hamachi (an outside program) to connect with friends. After spending most of the day tryng to set up the multi-player to only have it not work makes the multi-player a frustrating experience.  If you don't want the game because of the multi-player, are great with porting forward your ip address, or want to test your luck with hamachi then by all means get it, it is a really great game . But until they do something about multi-player and making it easier to connect with friends for those who don't fit in the above description I would just pass.",

Right from the start players are sown the class based system and are immediatly thrown into an immersive, yet harsh, world. At first glance it comes across at a difficult Roguelike game, but the longer you look at it, you begin to realise that there are more in-depth mechanics at play, The Primary of which being a time based difficulty scale, The longer you play, the More difficult the game gets, A nice touch, that prevents people from grinding for Items and Exp. While the item diversity mainly consists of items which increase damage and health in different ways, it really is neded for the grinding difficulty this game will put you through and as you progress through the game you will find or unlock more interesting items the make your bullets explode or one the attaches a tesla coil to you that electrocutes nearby foes, some items stack better with other classes though. On the topic of the class system, very few classes are pointless, each has their own unique and special weakness' and strengths. You start with The Commando, unlike many games with an unlock based class system, it is a very good class, It is very good at doing lots of damage quickly, while dodging to avoid taking hits in the process, I am about 12 hours into the game at this stage and have unlock almost all of the classes, exept the Huntress and the Mercenary, and the Commando remains to be one of my favourite classes of the lot. While some classes like HAN-D and The Sniper are difficult to play, and HAN-D in my opinion has little use, that is duue to my lack of experience with the character, which brings me to my final topic. Skill and experience, Risk of Rain is all about skill and until you get it down, this game will be painstakingly difficult, which is why it is probably best to practice with one class until moving on to the next, This game is also covered in an amazing layer of mystery and on you first few playthroughs the mystery of what all the items and enemies do is enthralling, All-in-All Risk of Rain is my favourite Roguelike of the year and will be playing a lot more of this. I can whole heartedly recommend this to anyone who likes roguelikes or has an interest in difficulty and balance!  9.5/10  ~Clawedcrab ★ ",

            "review_text": "UPDATED: After seeing the video, screenshots, and hearing the hype I wanted to give this game a try, In my first experience with the game I tried launching it and realized there was no audio. There was also a red error message crossing the top of my screen during the (muted) opening cinematic.  Thinking it was a user error I then did some searching and discovered the FAQ by the developer (as well as a few threads) in the discussion section of the game, each offering a way to 'fix' the error.   The next two hours were spent following those steps, as well as a dozen more I uncovered through a thorough search of the internet: on forums, help sites, and youtube. This extensive search online proved that this issue is actually rather common.  Eager to play the game I tried all of the fixes I could find. But nothing enabled my audio for this game.   I gave up that evening and played a few games that weren't plagued by audio problems.  The next day I tried again, driven by my friends who were playing the game without audio issues on their computers. In frustration I did every step a half-dozen times, and each time the audio wasn't fixed. AND THEN, after one of the many restarts of my computer, it worked! The audio played.  This was incredibly odd, because I know with utmost certainty that I'd done nothing different from the other half-dozen attempts. But still, it worked, so I didn't complain. I played multiplayer with friends and had an amazing time. We closed down the game after we had our fill and moved on to something else.  And then I tried to open to game again at a later time. No audio. Same error as before.  What followed was an exact repeat of the previous attempt. Try everything, try different variations on the steps, combine a few, log off and on, restart. Did that and again, after about half a dozen times it worked again. It wasn't even the same steps as before. By all reasonable accounts It was entirely at the roll of a die. I got lucky. And because of that the audio played.   Despite what so many people are shouting out on the discussion boards, I am personally among the ranks of MANY others (just do a quick search and you'll see this) who are at the whims of fate. The 'solutions' provided by the developer and general user alike are at best 'work arounds' that will likely have to be repeated over and over again until you get lucky.   There are those who don't experience this problem at all.  I envy them.   But this is affecting too many people. And all of these uncertain efforts taken by users to overcome an obvious error in the game should never be held up as a 'fix' or even as reasonable expectations. This is not a stable game. The developer needs to fix this bug. It's not something affecting a small area that people can't explore. It's the audio. All of the audio. And it's affecting a LOT of people who would otherwise love this game.  You might be one of the lucky ones. The game might work for you when you buy it. I don't know why you'd take that chance though. There are other games, just as good and in some cases less expensive, that don't demand that you roll the dice to see if a central component of the game will work every time you try to load it.   I recommend saving your money until the devs have provided a patch to actually reliably fix this.",

The controls are a little awkward and are the hardest part of playing the game. The bulk of the game is single-player-centric, meaning you can do it on your own with less trouble than you would have playing with a group. That said, again, the game is fun.  Okay, so the game is mostly just about playing snatch-and-grab with power-ups and trying to keep your distance from the mobs. When playing multiplayer, there are fewer power-ups for each player, so unless you have a very tight-knit group of players with perfect coordination, you will end up having some players perma-dying within a few minutes. Sure, they will come back for the beginning of each level, but they will be too weak to help the team in any way. Therefore, single-player is an easier and a more fun experience overall.  I vote 'Not Recommended' simply because the game does not meet my multiplayer desires and was a very frustrating multiplayer experience. It was still a good time in single-player but that was not why I got the game. I got the game for the multiplayer experience and was disappointed.

An absolute beacon of light, a true monumental achievement in broken multiplayer as well. Risk of Rain does away with such cumbersome and needless options like LAN to opt for a much smoother, completly well realized local multiplayer all on the same screen. Because it wasn't enough that Risk of Rain wants to give you suicidal tendancies with its control scheme, it wants to spread the sorrow to all those you cherish and hold dear. My friend and I sat dumbfounded, looking at the game screen, as it casually insists that the second player also use the keyboard...It hurts just recalling the memory.  And the cherry on top of it all - in their ever growing desire to appear cool, hip, retro, etc. the masterminds behind Chucklefish decided to give the actual online multiplayer a real blast from the past. For the first time in over a decade - since the ages of long gone gems like Age of Empires 1&amp;2, Quake 1/2, UT99, etc. Chucklefish listened to what gamers wanted and loe and behold, we all shouted in one unanimous roar: 'We want antiquiqated manual IP address inputs! We want the game to arbitrarily select closed ports for connections!'  I tip my fedora to the guys at Chucklefish. Way to make a statement.",

Very pleasing art style and a really kick-♥♥♥ soundtrack make the game aesthetically top notch. A good selection of playable characters, a huge amount of play modifying items, and unlockable 'artifacts' that change the way the game works. Random enemies and items, as well as semi-random levels give limitless replayability, and tons of unlockables to motivate further. Local and online co-op with up to four friends, (more if you edit a game file), really make the game shine.  Outside of the occasional minor glitch, which show up less and less as the devs continue to update, the only problem I've had with Risk of Rain is the wonky direct connect method the online co-op, which is easily remedied with Hamachi, or a similar tunnel service.

With no hope of rescue on a planet only meant to kill you, you have one chance. Make your way to what's left of your ship and kill everything in your way.  Thats the basic story setup, gameplay on the other hand is a whole other beast. There are 14 characters to choose from with unique styles of play, but the nimble Commando will be your first. Needless to say you'll need practice to get the hang of the controls and powers, for that I recommend a gamepad. As much as I'd like to say standard keyboard controls work, they don't, which is ironic considering the game only has partial support for controllers. Major oversight on their part.  That aside the bulk of the game revovles around constantly moving, as much as its tempting to try and pickup every single item on a map the difficulty increases as the game continues and doesn't reset each level. Finding the teleporter to get to the next one and picking up what items you can in your beeline to the finish is your best bet. As a result you don't exactly get many choices in what powers or abilities you get for an ideal build, you'll just take what you can. There's maybe at least 3 variants on each of the levels, meaning you'll have a chance to memorize some of them to make your pathing faster. Items on the other hand are randomly spread throughout, as well as the teleporter to activate the boss. So there's always a chance of hitting a dead end and wasting time.  Overall the game has a 50/50 chance of frustrating the crap out of you for things that aren't under your control or giving you the kind of satisfaction that only comes from beating near impossible odds. Which makes recommending the game a little tough. Which is why the bulk of this was a description of the mechanics and story. All of these choices were deliberate and very subjective to whether they pay off or not. For me they worked perfectly, but I do know many who would find such an experience soul draining.

I have no idea how it ended up so broken, but it is just utterly terrible right now. I can't say I endorse the game at the moment.  Nov 8: They've fixed some bugs, but not all of them. I have beaten the game once, and I enjoy it a good amount, but there are some glaring problems here that keep me from being a full supporter of it.  The game is actually really fun when you're playing with a friend, blasting through stages and collecting items and blowing enemies up. The difficulty is just right, and the enemies don't seem to get totally overwhelming. When solo, though, the game is entirely different, and becomes a strange suicide rush to try to get as far as you can. It's actually really infuriating, because there isn't much you can do when you roll a bunch of bad items in a row. I just finished a run where all twelve items I got were utterly useless to the point that I might as well have not picked them up at all. In contrast, I've had runs where I get three nice items to start with and suddenly I'm facerolling through everything for awhile.  The game is seemingly balanced around you either having a buddy to play with, or having access to an item called the Command Artifact that actually lets you choose what items you want when you open a chest. Unlocking Command involves getting a few stages in, hoping it rolls a certain one, and grabbing it, so it can be a pain to unlock.  I'm enjoying my time with this game, and I definitely expect to get some more hours out of it, but I can't say that I think it is a good purchase. The game has been totally bugged for a few weels, and the first batch of fixes they released feels more like a band-aid than a cure. The game kind of forces you to play co-op, or die repeatedly until you get lucky enough to get a good batch of items in order to unlock the Command Artifact in order to actually play the game as seemingly intended.  Dec 14:   I have pulled 23 hours out of the game now, and I honestly feel like I won't be returning much more, if at all. Over one month of owning it, and weird bugs still persist. Co-op, at the moment, is totally broken, despite working a few weeks ago. The jumping bug is fixed, where you would lose the ability to jump when you landed at the apex of your jump (the game thought you were still in the air due to the lack of downward momentum) but now there appears to be a lotto-like crash-to-desktop that only happens upon killing the last boss.... which means you can play for awhile, go to finish it off, and then suddenly learn that all the work you just did was fruitless.  Beyond those bugs, though, the game is just far too random for my tastes, and if I equip the artifact that lets me choose my items, the only thing I have to hope for is that I don't have a string of chests spawning in bad locations, and then I end up trivializing the entire game after a few minutes. I mean, it's a fun game. Out of my 23 hours, maybe five of them were purely unenjoyable... but that's five hours too much, and now when I play I'm either insanely frustrated with awful chest locations or I'm steamrolling through everything.  I got it for free, so I can't complain much, but this is also one of my longest reviews, and one of my only negative reviews, so, I guess I've complained a lot. Either way, expect anywhere between five to 25 hours of fun, and at least a couple of hours of pure frustration.",
