For example, it's near impossible to move only one square at a time unless you use the most ginger of key taps imaginable. This lack of fine control will often see you stepping on traps because you moved one space too many.  Otherwise PD is a pretty great game, however I feel the above gripe is enough to not reccommend it.",

But the port for this is very good, you can tell they worked very hard on it. Now I know your thinking 'Well why buy it here when i could just play it on my phone?' Because these p[eople deserve it. they are actual good devs. they care a tremendous amount about their game and the people playing it. now on to the fun stuff! -you will die a lot -you will rage a lot -you will cry maybe (probably(you baby)) -you will be on the brink of giving up -then you die and give up SIDENOTE: you probably shouldnt play if you any of the following types of people: 1. The Cry baby 2. The I got so mad I punched a hole through my monitor 3. The I hate rouge-likes(GTFO) or 4. The common console peasant (or filthy casual for that matter)",

The reason I got it for the PC was to be able to use my 360 controller on it, and I can't, not really. It reads the buttons, but not any of the sticks or pads, so you still end up using the mouse or keyboard to play.",
