            "review_text": "For what it is, I got a fair amount of play out of Multiwinia but it certainly isn't anything spectacular. Actually, it's about as simplified as an RTS game can possibly get. There is only one type of unit, and the only real control you have is to give a vague direction to them. Occassionally you'll use an item or pull off a clever pincer attack, but Multiwinia is very simplistic.  Despite being simplistic, or perhaps because of it, a large chunk of the gameplay is a grind. Send your 100 units to kill the enemy's 100 units and try to stop them from spawning more, so you can send in more and take a base that they can no longer defend. Of course, you'll be sending these units in waves, usually immediately after they spawn. As far as gameplay goes, there really isn't a lot there: you'll end up automating most of your units' movements.  There are a few different game modes but only a few of them really work well. King of the hill and generic base capturing are fine. There's a mode that involves capturing bases to fuel a rocket as well, but it's similar to the general base capturing mode. Another mode features capturing statues and returning them to your base (permanently) and while different enough, doesn't really get away from the base/king of the hill modes much. The last type I wouldn't recommend to anyone. It involves capturing a heavily fortified position. One army gets very frequent respawns while the other doesnt, but as there is little to no strategy in this game, it's very painful to play. The attacking team either sits and hordes units, or sends them in as he gets them. Either way, they almost all die for little to no progress against the defender.  There's online vs and it works well enough, but like I've said, the lack of any unique units or strategy really bogs this game down to a grind and you probably won't have a lot of fun with your friends. It's good for a game or two but after that you'll probably want to move on.  On the plus side, the AI is competent enough that playing against it isn't boring, especially if there are several enemy teams. Watching enemy teams duke it out is quite entertaining.  Oh, some really cool/scary things can happen if the aliens or darkwinians get out of control. ♥♥♥♥ those aliens man, they are god damned ridiculous.  Final note? The way items are distributed is pretty biased. I do like the idea that if you want the items then you have to send units to go collect them because you have to decide whether or not the reward is worth the risk of leaving an area unguarded or unharassed (pro tip: it usually is).  I liked it but I think I'm also in a very small minority of people that would. It's just so basic.",

The image of your multwinians carrying a huge statue will stay with you for a long time but I got bored with the whole scene after a few short hours and was glad that I had purchased the game heavily discounted.   A good purchase if you can get it cheap but don't expect the charm to last long.",

Whe you have friends to play with it makes the game 10x better, I use to play this game with firends all the time, we would have huge battles BOMBS, EXPLOSIONS, KILLING!!! We always made alliances with each other and fight to the near death. This game may look simply and not much fun but beleive me I put 15 hours in the demo just the demo! than 8 hours in the full game. I would recoomend you guys to pick this game up with your friends so you will have way more fun. this game for me is 10/10 well see ya later I'm going to go play this game XD   - Shawn Spencer.",

            "review_text": "Even though Multiwinia is mostly a multi player upgrade to Darwinia, it is an immensely better game than its predecessor. Nearly all aspects of the game have been improved to the point of near greatness in short bursts. In this iteration of the series, the focus is placed on multi player style game modes, which could also be played against the CPU. Multi player servers are available, but the amount of people playing in public games is scarce to none. This is not a problem, as the single player mode provides much entertainment, challenge, and excitement. Unit placement, movement, and orders have been polished beyond comparison to the nearly broken Darwinia. Everything is fluid, fixed, and sleek. There are also many power-ups and surprises that enhance the game play to the extent of limitless replay ability. In everything Darwinia went wrong, Multiwinia corrected and got right. There are so many maps to play in, and several game modes that will guarantee the almost permanent installation of Multiwinia on your system. You will go back to this game time and time again. The fun and excitement it provides is timeless. There is no reason to play the defective Darwinia if you have Multiwinia. The controls are outstanding, especially when you compare them to the controls and path finding disasters of Darwinia. Each game plays differently, as the variety in maps, game modes, random power-ups, and AI will change your experiences throughout. All difficulty levels are challenging and fun to play, even if you lose. Each match takes between five and twenty minutes, and time flies by quickly, as you are constantly paying attention to your enemies, your units, and ordering them around the map. The action is non-stop. Unfortunately, Multiwinia does not keep track of your personal statistics besides Steam achievements (which I do not care for). There is also a lack of leaderboards of any kind because of the non-inclusion of statistics keeping. It would have been extremely nice to have access to both, even if it were for single player only. Sometimes, you may be losing by a considerable amount, and you will still be able to pull off the win. Power-ups are important at times, depending on the luck of the draw. You will develop a liking to some of them, and apathy for others. While Multiwinia is a short-lived gaming experience, it is Introversion's best effort so far. This game is a perfect example of something you keep installed for years to come, always going back to it for quick matches action packed with fun and entertainment.  Multiwinia is okay.",

But I keep coming back to it because in a way, it's addicting.  It does not require a high-end computer to run it, even the lowest can run this at a decent framerate on low, and there is not a noticable difference between Low and High graphics settings.  Gameplay - 8.5/10 'It's easy to know what to do after one game' Effects - 7/10 'The random explosions and the simple yet appealing firing effects is beautiful' Overall - 9/10 'I highly recommend this game if you want time to pass by, if you are bored, or if you are waiting for that new game you bought to finish downloading.",
