            "review_text": "I've been a VERY LONG and dedicated fan to the Turok franchise since I was a child. Turok and Turok 2 were my first FPS games I have ever played, and I played them repeatedly as a child and into adulthood. I have every N64 game, PC port, Gameboy game, Turok Evolution, and even the incredibly average Turok 2008 on PS3 and PC. I even dabbled in the comics, toys, and collectables.   You're, most likely, coming here from the N64 version of Turok, and that's fine. To be honest, there were few differences, even visually, from the original PC port and the N64 port of Turok: The Dinosaur Hunter. On modern systems, there were a few glitches with the PC port, such as the music randomly cutting off entirely, and some visual hiccups.  This PC version actually has some dramatic differences from the original game. First off, visually, it's certainly improved in most areas, and unnecessary in others. The most important visual difference is the increased draw distance. HOLY CRAP was I surprised to see the game with increased view distance.  Don't misunderstand, there's still fog, but it's almost doubled in the amount you can see in front of you. There was so much environmental detail obscured by the N64 fog that has now been opened for everyone to see in this PC port.   As someone who has played Turok more times than I can even hope to remember, for possibly hundreds of hours total, I actually felt like I was playing a different game entirely for a moment. To new players, you won't be at all impressed. In fact, you will for a fact say that the game looks ugly and the level design is terrible. But for long-time fans of the game, this will rebreathe life into the game visually.  The next major change is the added on visual effects. This was mostly unnecessary, but I don't dislike any of it. There's now God Rays, Bloom, real-time reflections on water, and other visual effects. Sometimes they all clutter together in a bit of a mess, other times it looks rather appealing and colorful.  Luckily, love it or hate it, these options are toggleable. You can turn off what you want and leave on what you want. You can make the game look as close to the original PC/N64 port as you want, even as far as turning the screen resolution down to good old 1997 graphics.  The next major change is in gameplay. The original game, on N64 at least, made use of slightly clunky controls that resulted in making it impossible to do any precise aiming. To alleviate this, auto-aim was present, with no on-screen crosshair. In this PC port, there's still auto-aim, but I believe you can turn it off, and even put an on-screen crosshair. Since you'll likely be using a KB+M setup, this means you can finally aim (mostly) accurately with a typical modern FPS WASD setup.  Also, thanks to the VASTLY improved framerate (as this is on PC), moving, jumping, and shooting all feels responsive, and those first person platforming sections feel more possible than ever!  There is this horribly exaggerated headbob/sway. I know the original game certainly had headbob, but with the increased control and FOV it makes the sway dizzying to a degree. Strafing left of right has Turok fling his body and perspective by almost 45 degrees. Luckily, NightDive Studios provided and made the ability to turn this option off! Barely a couple days later they released a patch and now the headbob is completely toggleable, making the game much more playable to those who get sick from dramatic perspective shifts.  Finally however, there is the game environment itself. In the first level alone so far, there have been pretty sizable changes to enemy placements, environment positions, and even entire new sections of the level. Seeing these new areas made my head spin. It's  mostly  what you might remember, but certainly changed. I can't say if I entirely like this or not. On one hand, it's a nice change of pace, almost like I'm playing the game for the first time again. On the other, it does seem to mean that a lot I thought I knew about Turok is mostly useless. It hasn't been too drastic yet, however, but we will see how that changes as I progress in the game.  The music is still fantastic, easily my favourite percussion based soundtrack in any game EVER, fitting each level perfectly. Textures and character models are sharper and cleaner, but are exactly the same from 1997. Sound effects are also the same, though the sound design as a whole has been tweaked for the better to be more crisp.  I do have a few nitpicks: 1. No walk toggle. This was crucial in some of the platforming sections, and it seem Turok's movement speed has been slightly increased otherwise. 2. The earlier mentioned headbob/sway.  3. Gamepad controls feel floaty and imprecise. 4. The map overlay shows in areas that in the previous port didn't. For examples, in the original port there were certain areas where the map did not draw, forcing you to explore, mostly in maze like areas. To 98% of players, this might be a great change, but for the 2% that have brain damage like myself, we might prefer the areas where we couldn't rely on the map.  Overall, this is still Turok, one of the greatest old-school first person shooters I've ever played, and can only be topped by it's sequel, Turok 2: Seeds of Evil (Please be swift Nightdive Studios!!!)  I WANT to recommend this game to newcomers, but I'm afraid most of them will ♥♥♥♥ all over it for being old and outdated.  This is really meant to be a game for the fans and nostalgic players, of which there are many.  Edit about Price (12/17/2015): A friend of mine mentioned about the price. Currently, on release, it's sitting at $16 on sale, and $20 normally. Personally, I find that $15 should be the standard price, and they could have done $10 on sale. Other people would disagree and say $10 should be the base price. I feel $15 is fair, for a couple reasons. 1. The original PC port of Turok is sitting between $20-40 depending on where you look. There are a few areas where it's cheaper, but the only one I found was from Italy. 2. The original PC port isn't guaranteed to work. I know personally I had issues getting the soundtrack to keep playing during gameplay 3. This isn't using the original engine, meaning some work had to be put in, especially to slap on those graphical effects and the change things around. This isn't a simple updated port, there are things literally changed from the source material.",

I got it when I was 7 and couldn't get past the first cave! I WAS TOO SCARED! When I finally did make it I felt like such a badass.  Having my childhood returned to me in the form of my FAVORITE N64 game is SUCH an indescribable joy. I have played every Turok game from Dinosaur Hunter to, Seeds of Evil, Shadow of Oblivion and even Rage Wars, I still remember all the little hidden health packs and guns.  Game runs smoothly and I am not a fan of the price but since this game holds a special place to me I will wear my nastalgia goggles and get it anyway. HOWEVER, unless you also have a pair of super awesome nastalgia goggles I would recommend waiting for a sale. A great blast from the past that should at least be played once by everyone who loves shooters.",

            "review_text": "This is an update for the original PC port of Turok: The Dinosaur Hunter, which is in turn, a port of the original Nintendo 64 game. What you get is new visual effects like FXAA, water refraction and bloom though the actual base game itself hasn't been changed in the slightest.  At its core, Turok is a series of maze like levels with a short draw distance due to the hardware of the Nintendo 64, where you collect 2-3 keys per level to access 8 different stages before defeating the final boss. Along the way you collect a bunch of weapons, kill poachers, dinosaurs and aliens and search for the 8 hidden pieces of a weapon called The Chronoscepter.  Great game that is very much a product of its time, with limited lives, manual save points and a fixed health bar system. It's definitely not a timeless masterpiece but still an enjoyable game with a unique theme.

The games frame rate is locked at 60 FPS with no way to uncap, thats a bummer, however it is understandable when dealing with such old software.

            "review_text": "[TL;DR AT BOTTOM]  This game brings me back to the summers of 1998 to 2001. I would fly down with my family to Florida to spend a few weeks at our condo. I always remember looking forward to seeing my cousin every summer because of the endless nights of gaming on the N64 and PS1 with no bedtime with him. I forgot how many hours we ended up spending on classics like Shadows of the Empire, Goldeneye, Dino Crisis... You name it! The one game that sticks out most to me from this time period is none other than Turok.  18 years later this game is as much of a masterpiece now as it was then, but I would wager that it takes an older breed of gamer to truly appreciate the admittedly clunky mechanics of what made Turok so great in 1997.   This is a great re-release/remaster of the 1997 Acclaim title done by Night Dive Studios. They are more known for what they have done to the System Shock series, first porting them over to modern PC systems, and then announcing they will be working on a remake of the original. I would say that this is a proper re-release, but I have no doubt that others will clearly disagree with me.  Yes, this is a game that begs for nostalgia goggles to be worn-- but then again, this is the game as we imagined it in our young(er) heads after all, is it not? Coming back to play classic titles can sometimes be a depressing experience, as we notice flaws formerly looked over, or things that in general, just don't hold up. This is not the case here.  For starters, this game got a graphical overhaul. It runs on, reportedly, an entirely new engine. While most of the textures look primarily the same, it is a bit refreshed. Probably the biggest fix is the draw distance fog-- it hardly exists anymore and you can see heaps more of the game as it was intended to be seen. There are tons of graphical options to tinker with in-game, but this is hardly a taxing game by any standards. I am running the game at 1080P and it never dips below 60FPS. The 'enhanced' graphics might not appeal to some, and may not impress others, but this was one thing the game sorely needed.  As far as I can recall this is about the same game we got in '97, I don't believe anything was added or removed story-wise. Gameplay however is much smoother. No more fiddling around with an N64 controller anymore, praize da lawd. Platforming is a breeze now.  I would like to say that this game and its playstyle will likely polarize modern gamers. This is probably not something the COD/Rocket League crowd would enjoy. It's a slow burn you have to grind your way through, similar to Dark Souls, but not as difficult, and more rewarding.  The sound design is notably improved, with a higher fidelity soundtrack, and better quality sound effects.  Native controller support is very comfortable and all the controls are totally mappable to whichever configuration you prefer.  If you want a great, classic single player FPS game to play, look no further, but just bear in mind this is probably not for everybody!  I would like to express my thanks to Night Dive Studios for not merely pushing out a product that was not touched in 18 years, but instead, putting hard work into bringing back the glory of the 1990s with Turok's remaster. Thank you!  TL;DR Section  Pros: -Vastly improved graphics and gameplay mechanics -Native controller support -Well written, self-contained storyline -Nice 21st century touches such as updated HUD -Difficult, but rewarding and fun gameplay -Dinosaurs -Huge levels with emphasis on collecting everything -Did I mention dinosaurs?  Cons: -Textures do not hold up well at all. I would have enjoyed some refreshed textures -No mod support (yet) -No force feedback for controllers -AI is hit or miss  -No online play/co-op -High price point probably a turn off to most -Difficulty/playstyle not for everyone   9/10",

            "review_text": "This game was my childhood. I reccomend anybody to download this and play it. Why? This game was one of the best shooters for its time, and it changed FPS for the better. Same with Turok 2:Seeds of Evil. This is a game where you can sit down and run through it, and then run through it over and over, with the same enjoyment.   You will not be dissapointed, especially with the draw distance the way it is. Now, lets get into some things you might run into you don't like.  There is a difficulty setting, easy, normal, hard, harcore. Hard and Hardcore are a little buggy, considering what changes are the enemies basically sliding across the loor like its an ice rink, making them hard to hit. I don't reccomend you try hardcore until the next update.  Dying by enemies such as soldiers, or raptors, low level enemies, is extremly rare considering you will have weapons that WILL kill them fast. Bad platforming actions or decissions usually land you a reload or losing a life.  Bosses are exceptionally easy if you are used to strafing and shooting.   If you are looking for a good adventure, first-person shooter and puzzle game, all meshed up into one video game, this is the game for you. If Turok 2 comes out, thats even better, because for its time, these games, changed FPS. As said above.  Greatest tip: Check around THE ENTIRE ROOM when you enter it. If you are looking for something, it can be sadistically crammed into a spot. You never know.",

Graphics are still from 1997 but the game is not. It has several visual improvements, such as less foggy feeling and less laggy gameplay. It's also more brighter.   Downsides of this port are the steep price of it and there's several fun bugs missing, such as the grenade launcher shot against dead enemies. In the N64 version, even though they were dead, they were still screaming when you shot them while they flew in the air. As for the grenade launcher, thats a very deadly weapon, against yourself. Even if you think you are outside of the grenade explosion radius, you are still inside it. I do not remember grenade doing this much damage on yourself.  The later levels are just pipes you run in, the jungle levels are the best ones. You can even explode a tree off against enemy. The enemies have basic health count, there are no headshots. This game also uses very rare death animations that really no game besides goldeneye on N64 had.  Good game, get it if you can get it under 10€, do not get it with the current price, unless you are really old timer.",

The view distance is still very short and you can't see very far due to the fog which is annoying. There are minor glitches like when you look into water you see a poor attempt of replication a relection and it just looks like your seeing whats underwater. Some of the hitboxes are a little wierd still but overall it's pretty good. This is the best version of Turok by far, the only problem is that it's $20 at full price. The 15 dollars is the most I am willing to pay for a game made in 1997. It's not a remake, it's a remaster and I feel like the developer is trying to make extra cash over nostalgia. Unless you really like Turok or old school FPS games like me then I highly recommend you wait for a sale to bring it down to $10. Turok still has almost no story and doesn't hold up as well as other old school FPS game. Even with all its flaws It still is a enjoyable experience 18 years later. Turok gets a 7.9/10 -Infinite",

I have Turok, and Turok 2 on N64, and it's nice to play them with my desired control method.  What draws me to these games is their originality (native americans fighting dinosaurs, aliens, cosmic horrors.) and the colourful and epic weapons. The levels are pretty big and fairly linear, so you won't find yourself getting too lost, the enemies have decent AI (they roll to the side to dodge bullets etc etc) and if you shoot them in the right way they clasp at their neck gasping for air before dying.  The platform sections can be a bit irritating, but, they had those back in the halcyon days of FPS games, so I can't grumble too much about it.  All in all, a must buy if you loved the originals. and for those who haven't played a Turok game, give it a whirl if you're sick of the same cookie cutter 'realistic' modern military shooters.",

            "review_text": "Turok: Dinosaur Hunter is a relic of a different era of game design. One that was more at home with Super Mario Bros and The Legend of Zelda than Doom and Quake.  Turok bares a lot more qualities reminiscient of Mario than Doom really. The game features an overly cartoony art style with exaggerated proportions, it takes place in a vague indeterminate setting called the 'Lost Land' reminiscient of Mario's mushroom kingdom. It features player lives and pickups inorder to gain new ones. It has a hub level strictly for warping to new ones ala Super Mario 64. It has platforming sections. And the general objective of the game is to 'gather something from every level in the game and kill the final boss'. It's weird to me coming back to it since, swap the graphics and change the protagonist into a plumber and the enemies into goombas and you have 'Super Mario the FPS'. Just add dinosaurs.  Now this game originally released on the N64 and has been ported to a brand new engine with this release. You have things like a water reflection shader, higher framerate, FOV options and widescreen. The higher framerate causes the game to feel much faster and more akin to Serious Sam.  Now all this being said. Whether it's worth the 20$ asking price is entirely dependant on if you like older first person shooters and don't mind the rough edges. Since you can beat it in about 6 or so hours. Personally I do like the game as is, and with the promise of a level editor and Turok 2 down the road, I'm more excited for the future of the series than I ever was before.",

If you enjoyed it before, or if you like that sort of old-school N64 shooter, like Quake for example, then I'm pretty sure you'll like this.

I really enjoyed it as a kid, having owned it on the N64, but I don't think it has held up as well as some other games.  Level design is often just big rooms or hallways with enemies thrown around. Some levels in the mid to late game are cool, but early levels are kind of dull and the last couple levels throw a lot of mazes at you. Some of the keys you need are easy to miss and the game doesn't give any indication of whether you've passed a key or if it's still further up. (I was missing level 3 key 3 and spent a long time searching for it because I didn't realize the level end portal teleported you to a boss instead of the hub.)   There is a good variety of weapons, although many share ammo and some are only upgrades of lesser guns. Most of the enemies don't feel very distinct, many are reskinned or feel the same. As the game goes on, enemies get more health, so it's easier and quicker to just run past everything and kill only enemies that are triggers.  If you played it back in the day and loved it, it is probably worth picking up. If you have never played it, I recommend getting it if you like Doom games or if you really like old 3D action platformers. I finished it in less than 6 hours, so keep that in mind. This version adds a lot of convenient graphical and gameplay options that helps bring Turok up to modern fps standards, but if you still have an old copy you might be better off just playing that.",

Bought it and now iam returning it but why? - The fact that I saw 160 hours on an individual's review and a couple others on release who gave it a complete thumbs up before the game was even released with achievements just begs for a slam and seems fishy thus people are calling him out for it.  Updated : Just found out hes a dev/beta tester/ shill, No that is an AUTOMATIC THUMBS DOWN from me and just raises red flags big time so I returned it instead because i felt I bought into something really shady, hence why. Would had kept the thumbs up and keep the copy if they were more HONEST.  Do I hate it? Nope, Is it pretty good? it brings back memories. Would I recommend you buying it? If you must jump back into turok. Would I buy it again? No because the dev used shills and tatics to jumpstart review for sales.     Pros",

Get the original cartridge for 15$ at a flea market. Dated mechanics? Just because you can't use shift to sprint and you can't aim down sights whilst looking at your GPS to find items doesn't mean it has to be qualified as 'badly dated'.  If you are one to complain about the price tag, I highly doubt you spend your money in everyday's life in a more intelligent way. You probably paid double, yet triple the price for a game you utterly regret.  No complaints about this. It was great fun then, it's great fun now.",
