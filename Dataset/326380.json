            "review_text": "Mystery of Neuschwanstein is nice little casual hidden-object game . I got this game as a gift and I played the whole game (including the bonus chapter ) in around 4 hours .  Gameplay 7/10  Traditional hidden-object game style . Nothing new is added to the genre , but it also doesn't fail anywhere .You combine a few things e.g. glue with another object and of course you riddle the hidden-object scenes . A bit short ( I finished the game and bonus chapter in around 4 hours )  Music /Sound 7/10  The sound of the environment is well done , you've got the sizzling sound of fire , rain, and so on .There 's no real epic background music (like in Skyrim ) , but some nice relaxing and sometimes suspense adding tunes , that are actually quite nice . Well IMHO this music fits this type of game way better as epic music would draw the attention away from the puzzles .   Story 7/10  Well the story as almost always in hidden object games is kind of ...how to say .hmm...not very logical , a little far off.. but honestly I don't really care with these games ... they're still fun .So don't expect anything life changing or really touching , story wise .  It supports Steam Cloud and has various achievements .   Synopsis :  Good game for a rainy day...or a few hours of hidden-object fun .",
