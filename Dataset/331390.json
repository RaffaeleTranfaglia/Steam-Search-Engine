If you want to play it right, you have to pause the game every 2 or 3 seconds. And I had no problem with that. But the main reason I'm writing this review is because I don't understand why everyone says this is grindy. I've always played on normal, and a couple of times I've played the lower levels on hard to farm some items. But by no means is this abnormal grinding for me. I've finished the 'campaign' now, and I had to farm maybe 2 hours for the whole campaign? Opposed to 'hundreds of replays' I see in many reviews. You probably have to farm a ton if you're not paying 100% attention to the game. I paused almost every 2 seconds, that's a lot, but that's the game.  So, a hard strategy game which requires full attention, but certainly a good game.",

I was looking for a tower defense game and this is a little unsatisfying, but I don't regret this purchase because I can see potential in these guys. Hopefully they will make a better tower defense game in the future.",
