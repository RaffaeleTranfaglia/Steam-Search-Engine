Transforming your pet, fishing 24/7, quests, skill depth, and the anticipation of finding that one item that you can sell for huge amounts of gold is what keeps me going. Would love to see more and more games in this series!",

            "review_text": "This sequel of FATE is wraught with bad design choices. As a new character you're bound to get frustrated by dungeon levels giving enemies 10 levels extra, while you're lucky for 1-2. Even combining the 2 dungeons the game is rich, that means max 4 levels per 10 level increment. It is not unlikely to get a starter-quest at dungeon level 2, being level 2 where you have to defeat a lvl 8 alter (not that bad right) defended by 3 lvl 14's who can 3-shot you. Good thing there are 3. If through massive potion use and much much cheesing you defeat one, it will just be respawned by the altar... great fun! (NOT) And this just one example of many more.  It seems intended for characters who finished FATE, but what fun would be going lvl 10 again with your powered up FATE character. Not to mention between the game balance gets completely lost since a lvl-up in 1 means 4 skillpoints, in 2 it's only 2. Just to screw over new characters even more?  What is the result of all this abonimable game design you ask? A terrible unfun game. If you seek to quench your thirst for hack&amp;slash, play the original FATE or one of the Torchlights instead. Avoid this game like the plague...",

Cannot load the game in windows 10, gives an application error and crashes to desktop; none of the 'fixes' work for me. This is an old game, and should not have been allowed to be uploaded to Steam unless it was compatible with new tech/operating systems. Stay away unless the game is fixed!",

At the point that I discovered it, I had already played Torchlight and that is the best way to summarize my feelings of this game.  FATE was the precursor to Torchlight. Even down to the very concept of fishing for items and to change the characteristics of your journeying sidekick pet. The game is fun. Torchlight did well to follow (and expand upon) the guidlines the FATE series created.  If you want some good ol' nostalgia dungeon-crawly goodness, you'll enjoy the game. Despite playing and beating BOTH Torchlight games, I still find FATE very enjoyable.",

        {
            "review_text": "The FATE series in general is still fairly good even compared to today's dungeon crawlers.   One little thing they could improve upon is the hardcore gameplay. Besides providing a challenge throught the entire course of the game, every floor has enemies that jump up every 10 levels which just adds to the difficulty in a substantial way. The issue with this is you really have to grind out the @ss just to stay up to par with the enemies. Imagine fighting off a level 50 boss + minions all while still level 10-20ish. The disadvantage here is the hit rating against you for being severly underleveled. This applies to singled out mobs too as they are still a threat even with good gear.   But overall if you don't play for the hardcore but the various other features the game has to offer, by all means get FATE and all its sequels when they go one sale.",

There's new dungeons and monsters and few of those monsters is from FATE, not only that there's new fishes and the rare weapons from the first game is in the game too. But the best part about the game is that you can import your character from every FATE game which make you OP when you start a new game.  10/10 Big DLC/game",

I played it on another website Wildtangent to well you know give it a try and I liked it then it was addicting at least for me. Now after a while I noticed it was on steam so I bought it on sale. After playing this it brought back a lot of memories so that was good. The game is fun and it's one of those games where the game itself is great for passing time. So all in all I'd give it an 9/10 because after playing it for a certain amount of time it can get boring but after that its a great game. If I was one of you i'd catch it on sale and give it a try.",
