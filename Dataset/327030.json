            "review_text": "Worms W.M.D is the latest installment in Team 17‘s long running artillery strategy series about warring annelids. Due to popular demand, the game’s developer decided to go back to the series’ roots and make a true 2d game, though W.M.D still presents many changes over its predecessors.  The basic gameplay mechanics are the same as they’ve been for two decades. Players command a team of worms (which may be customized with different voice packs, gravestones and visual styles) and must defeat an opposing worm force using a wide variety of wacky weapons. The action still flows perfectly from turn to turn, and drowning enemy worms is as satisfying as it was a decade ago.  Worms W.M.D‘s presentation echoes Worms Armageddon, a game which most longtime fans of the franchise still consider as the best. From the detailed 2d art, to the removal of some controversial features such as classes or water physics, everything screams “your childhood favorite is back!” This doesn’t mean that W.M.D doesn’t try a few new things though. Team 17‘s new game introduces several new concepts to the strategy franchise, with varying degrees of success.  Chief among the game’s new toys is the ability to pilot vehicles and man static weapon emplacements. Worms can now get in the driving seat of tanks, mechs and helicopters, adding some interesting dynamics to the battlefield. Taking command of a helicopter and raining fire from above as the enemy team sits in an oil barrel filled zone never gets old. The static guns also offer new strategic options, as players have to choose between mobility and firepower, and the mounted weapons platforms can be destroyed, dealing damage to their operators when that happens. The second game-changing addition is the crafting system. Worms can now collect resources (or dismantle old weapons to obtain the bits that make them work) and craft new weaponry, making an already unpredictable game even more chaotic. Enterprising players will rapidly learn that they can actually use the enemy’s turn to craft new gear, a welcome distraction when the opposing commander is laying waste to your troops.  Players can now make use of buildings to shelter themselves from enemy bombardment or prying eyes. Sadly, the execution isn’t as polished as one would desire, and sometimes it’s hard to tell which part of the environment is a building, and which is just part of the map’s decoration (a problem that was already present in Worms: Clan Wars, although that game didn’t feature buildings in the same way as W.M.D)  Worm customization, a hallmark of the series, has been given an incredible amount of detail. There is a leveling system that gradually unlocks more hats, gravestones, voice packs and music, making players feel as if there’s always something new to try out.  The game’s content is as plentiful as the customization options, with a generous amount of singleplayer missions and challenges, and an extensive multiplayer suite. Worms W.M.D also features Steam Workshop support, letting players download new maps created by other gamers with the included level editor. Worms W.M.D is a successful reimagining of the long running artillery strategy series, mixing Armageddon‘s colorful visuals and tight gameplay with some welcome additions. Team 17 has created a new classic, easily recommended for both newcomers and longtime fans of the franchise.  8.5/10 – Great.

This review is coming form a person who loved Clan Wars and loved Revolution even more (i have a playtime of 350 hours between those two). I really liked the water physics and the roping system in those games. I enjoyed how i could play around turrets by flying fast or making them role down hills. I also liked worms customisations that made an inpact on how you played the game (i'm talking about the classes)  Me and my friends played this game with strategy - always thinking about where to put worms just so would not be knocked out, we found out a lot of ways to play around turrets and avoid being washed off of a cliff.  All of these things have sadly not been added to this game. This game is by no means bad - it's fun and enjoyable but i feel like the depth and some of the tactical skill needed to play has been removed.  Also it costs 30 euros... that's a bit steep for a Worms game.  In conclusion: I would recomend this game for anyone who enjoyed the old classic worms titles. It's a fun party game that most people would enjoy. I would not recomend this game for people who enjoyed the mechanics and depth that Revolution offered because most of those have been removed. (i know that this group is probably smaller but it's still nice to get my voice out there)  P.S. I am a non native English speaker so i appologise for any grammar or spelling errors that i have made",

Worms revolution had good graphics and such but it introduced a stupid class system that I felt that was really bad and it kinda unbalanced the games you played. Worms W.M.D is going back to the roots of worms and combining everything we know and love about the franchise. Can't wait to play some more! 10/10",

            "review_text": "Worms W.M.D has broke the cycle in what some people call '2d worms clone number 1111'. When I was growing up I used to play Worms Armageddon all the time with my childhood friends, and the game brought some of the most fun I've had when it comes to local couch vidya. As I was growing up and continuing to support the team by buying each worm game I felt a tiny drop of quality with each new 2d worms game, even though there's nothing wrong with the modern worms games I feel that none of them really captured the fun that armageddon or party did.   When I read that W.M.D was bringing a hand drawn artstyle I was really excited because the look of worms aesthetically has always been from a well drawn look rather than a generic 3d artstyle. I think it comes more from the heart when drawing it. It gave me nostaglia because worms has always been a unique look and seing the devs go back to their roots in my personal opionion is what this game needs. Also the new mechanics that the new worms has implimented are really exciting and bring flavour to the game rather than not adding new mechanics and just giving it a new 3d look, giving the game vehicles and buildings really add that extra ammount of content that gives this game even more variation than the previous worm games has ever had before.   The whole point of the worms games is to have your friends over and playing for hours while having as much variation in content as possible, when applying the cosmetics that you have for your worms with the new content such as buildings, vehicles and mounted turrets meshed in with old content only solidifies what I'm trying to convey. We also have a workshop added so that you can download maps in a modern way which is always a plus.   I feel that the devs are finally on the right track with this game, and if you've ever wanted to try one of the modern worms games that has been released, I'd give this a try. Because I think they've finally got it right.",

TEAM17 haven't changed much of the core gameplay; new for players who haven't played worms since the 'golden era' are the addition of buildings that can be entered, vehicles and crafting.  All the additions add depth to the gameplay: - The buildings make for great cover and can even 'hide' worms from the enemy. - Crafting makes all crate drops feel worthwhile (no more getting a bat when the last enemy worm is on the otherside of the map) and offers great tactical depth: Do you craft a homing missile to be sure to get that crucial target or go for a big air-strike on multiple worms? - Vehicle (and mountables) offer variety if nothing else.  Best of all? You can disable any or all of these new features as you see fit. TEAM17 isn't shoving them down your throat and saying 'this is what a worms game should be like!'. If you wan't 'pure' worms you can. In fact you can tinker with a great deal of settings to make the worms game YOU want.  Apart from good gameplay the game offers: - Great (in my opinion) hand-drawn aesthetics. Worms, levels and weapons all look amazing! - Great meaty sound-effects and lots of 'sound customizations'. - Easy and accessible menus for both keyboard/mouse and controller setups. - Support for controller and KMB at the same time, which is especially great for people using steam controllers.  Worth a buy at full price, especially if you have someone you can play against in LAN!",

Despite this, the artificial intelligence in Worms games does not seem to have advanced at all!   I don’t think I’ve ever seen an AI worm use a ninja rope or even navigate the map by more than a few inches. However, they can somehow throw a grenade across the whole level, making it bounce off a pube of terrain that is invisible to the human eye and roll down a blowtorch hole, exploding just as the timer reaches zero.  This is a good worms game. They haven’t tried to add a story to the single player campaign but it is well rounded and has additional challenge levels which are more like puzzles that get you to think outside the box.  Let’s face it, though, single player isn’t where it’s at with a Worms game. The joy of Worms is when your opponent tries to kill you with a sheep but it gets caught on something, turns around and blows him three miles off the side of the map.  Yes, multiplayer is truly a joy in Worms WMD but this is sadly where my only real criticism lies. Due to (in my opinion) a combination of poor marketing, a high price point and no cross platform multiplayer, the online scene in Worms is usually very quiet. That being said, all of these points are fixable, so fingers crossed for a larger player base in the future.  p.s. The game also features vehicles and crafting, which you will either like or dislike, but other reviewers have already covered these topics to death. ",

I look forward to seeing this game become the worms game we have all been waiting for, it's not there yet, but I am cautiously optimistic.  I requested a refund, since I don't think the game is worth the asking price in it's current state, but I will probably buy it again if Team17 continues to build on it and make it worth my money.",

Quite disappointed by the rope. the rest is more or less fine, even though I didn't like how nades bounce on things... Didn't spend much time in playing it though, I have watched some streamings also from other players.  go back to w:a. If they will fix something, I will buy it again.  GG for now.  Update: refund requested. Guess or you like it or not, I don't. For me w:a is the definitve game. But maybe I agree, it has 'something' of w:a, but don't aspect that masterpiece. It's a different game, I am sure someone will like it.",

So far so good!",

I saw two lobbies on a Saturday evening, and I feel there should be ten, at least -Quite lacking in raw content -Worms aren't as customizable as in previous games (ESPECIALLY Worms Ultimate Mayhem) -Mechs are either OP or borderline useless, there's no in between  Conclusion: I only reccomend it to:  A) Hardcore Worms fans B) People who love turn-based stratedgy games C) People with too much disposable income As it is right now, I feel that £20 is a very steep price for a game that is quite lacking in raw content. I hope you like offline a lot, because that's really you're only option for a serious game at this point. It may get better down the line, but as it is right now, think VERY carfully about making your purchase.",

Everyone plays this for the multiplayer, best part of the game. the ai can be a bit aim-bottish at times, but if you know what you're doing, it's a fair battle.  You can have up to 8 worms on a team, and you take turns using one worm to either deal out as much damage as you can to the enemy team, or plan defensively to minimize incoming damage, with the goal obviously being, wipe out the other team. There's also an armageddon mode, which rises the water after 20 minutes (this can be changed), so that rounds don't go on for too long. You can even set it to have the water start rising at the very start of the match, or not rise at all.  If you haven't played any worms game before, this is the most recent and arguably the best one.",
