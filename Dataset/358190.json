            "review_text": "One of the first games of the genre (if not the very first, in fact) that I had the chance to play, from a demo that came with a new PC back in those heroic times.  Flawless gameplay, fantastic environments, cool (if sometimes a bit annoying) enemies of varied strengths and attributes, lots of secret areas that yield all kinds of bonus items. Oh, and the teleporting warp. And the music.  Inevitable to feel nostalgic replaying it, for us old school gamers. Visually it may seem simplistic to the newer generations, but it can also teach one thing or two about movement coordination, lightning fast reflexes and needing to pay attention at twenty different things simultaneously.  The final boss is the perfect cross between hilarious and outrageous.",
