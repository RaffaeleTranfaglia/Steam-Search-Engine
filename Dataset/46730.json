            "review_text": "You know, if it was the last ARPG on Earth, I'd probably play it. The art style is not bad for the time it was made and the mechanics work... to some extent. Fun loot drops and you can feel yourself getting stronger and taking less damage as you get increasingly better armor. In spite of all the complaints here, Hazen surprisingly ran fine on my Win7 x64 system with only one crash when entering a dungeon. When reloaded, the game left me back where I was.  Now for the bad parts: 1. No saving allowed in a dungeon. If the game crashes you may lose up to a half hour of progress. 2. There is some kind of memory leak that slows down the game the longer you play. Your melee swings and casts get slower and slower while the enemies rush you at the same speed. 3. It takes a while to get used to the backwards controls. You move with rt. click and everything else is left click. No key rebinds.   Worst of all are the ungodly respawns that slow you down as you travel to your destination then back to your village. No teleports or shortcuts, just the long, slow trek back while fighting the same enemies you fought on the way there. The first two hours had me traveling the same path numerous times while fighting the same respawns. It can be maddening.  Compared to a far superior ARPG like Torchlight that came out a year earlier, Hazen: The Dark Whispers just can't compete.",
