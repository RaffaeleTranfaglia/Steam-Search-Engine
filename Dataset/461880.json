            "review_text": "Very cool game. I read the other reviews and wondered if they had been playing the same game.   I don't usually like 'puzzle' games but this one is beautifully balanced between learning - failure and then success. It's a fair game that won't let you away with mistakes but at the same time - rewards your patience and skill.  The graphics and music and pleasant but I did notice some frame dropping - but that happened only on certain levels. Most were fluid and responsive.   This game has been cleverly made to draw you in. And it drew me in. You also get about 28 lives to start with and you'll need them. But I found that as I got better - I found new life tokens which were great.  It's been a while since i've seen a game that is beautiful and absorbing without any annoying side issues. You get right to the heart of gameplay - immediately. No talking racoons or wizards to annoy and distract.   A very nice example of intelligence - design and thoughtful creativity. And it's fun !!!",
