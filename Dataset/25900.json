While only a handful of hours into the game, thus far it has already surpassed all expectations and the regard I had for HOMM 1-6 and Disciples 3. If you liked any of of the HOMM iterations or Disciples, you will appreciate King's Bounty: The Legend. My only regret is in buying the game standalone instead of a bundle which I'll now buy as still a better bargain than grabbing the expansions singularly.   Enjoy Friends :)  EDIT: To give a bit mroe detail the game, I come to King's Bounty with serious HOMM experiece and a bit of Discpiples. IMO, the HOMM and Disciples are grreat series' but they all fall down at the point of eventually aving spent hours upon hours to build huge armies only to find the AI has outdone you. King's Bounty so far has enough in the smaller side quests to be rewarding enough to give the above review while avoiding 'Enemy Heroes' while I build up my Mage in readiness to take over the world ;]  In summary, If you haven't played the series before but enjoy the 'HOMMi=-like' subgenre as I saw it, you will love this game.",

            "review_text": "10/10 - Little Towns, Big Worlds and an Epic Amount of Content!  I’m way late getting to play this game but it’s still amazing even for today's standards! This game really is really withstanding the test of time. The campaign is pretty epic, and just solely finishing the campaign took me about 33 hours!! If you explore everything and complete all the quests you are looking at about 60-70+ hours of gameplay! Not too bad for just a couple bucks. I’m pleased to announce that there are about 4 more games in this series waiting for me and more to come!  The world exploration, story and turn-based grid combat come together in a brilliant fashion and really keep you captivated longer than you could anticipate! A few points to consider to maximize your enjoyment of the game!   1) The font is super small! There is a mod you can drop in the folder to increase text size; this isn’t available for the other games so take advantage of this since the story is really good. Every character and quest has some serious depth if you care to explore!  2) Until you get the hang of things try to stick to the main storyline indicated with a crown. This will ensure you stick to battles that you can win. You won’t be completing a full island at once since different levels of enemies are all around, it can be easy to mistakenly run into an unbeatable enemy.   3) Prevent frustration and use the right mouse button to click on enemies from afar. This will indicate the power level of the enemy ranging from Very Weak to Invincible! If you are wondering you can defeat enemies up to very strong but proceed at your own risk!   Overall, A MASSIVE value no matter how you look at it. It’s only $7! If you complete the campaign only you are looking at about 21 cents an hour for some fantastic gaming! Feel free to drop me a message if you can’t find the mod. I will complete the other games for sure!     Accidently Reviewed",

            "review_text": "King's Bounty: The Legend was my first meeting with this kind of turn based RPG and I was left speechless. The game provides so much fun whether you like exploring thoughtfully designed fantasy world in real time or prefer to try out your tactical skills in turn based battles. Units are skillfully balanced and diverse, magic and special skills just add more to the already satisfying diversity of battles. The story may seem to be kind of cliche like, but which 'You are a hero who has to save the world' is not like that, right? For me it provided entertaining background which urged me on. I have also found quite surprising remarks on Prattchetts The Discworld, every fan of this great series has to appreciate those.",

If you buy this for $2 you are getting your monies worth. This game doesn't mess around. Your army will get destroyed countlessly just to get a small fraction of power. If you lose a lot of units in a battle you will just continue struggle inching to get through the game. It's a game where you hardly feel like you are making progress until many hours later.   There's a lot of cool ♥♥♥♥ in the game. Marriage/family system, loot, decent written dialogue, and decent music. The only con I can think of is that it will take you a century to finish the game. It's so god damn long. If there was one HOMM game to be all HOMM games. This one is it. I recommened it if you are into HOMM style games, and want something really worth your money.  I highly don't recommened it if you want an rpg/tactics game that you can play through casually. You will never finish it. Don't get me wrong, I really like this series, its just the games in the series are very long. The Legend is long for all the wrong reasons I feel. There's maybe just a bit too much side quests. They hardly feel optional because your progress will get halted very fast. Overall, it's a very well made game. It just feels insanely long.",

Additionally, quirky camera angles and very generic missions make for a game experience that never reaches the feeling of the HOMM series.

The game runs on Normal skill at roughly 50-60 hours long and much longer on any higher difficulty but I highly recommend Normal for a challenge. The locales are varied, there is almost no VO but the story is intriguing (what little there is). The gameplay is solid and the characters interesting enough. Battles are balanced as are the skill trees of the 3 classes (Warrior, Mage, Paladin) as well as their weaknesses being balanced in combat.
