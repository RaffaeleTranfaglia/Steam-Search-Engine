            "review_text": "Hylics is a hidden gem, and from the screenshots alone anyone can see it looks utterly unique- it's a crazy trip. A lot of the reviews talk about that aspect and the insane, randomly generated writing, so I'll focus on how it plays. Hylics was quite a bit deeper than I expected in terms of mechanics and what it offers up.  Combat at the start feels pretty meh when you're a one-man team, but even so smart use of the moves at your disposal makes combat interesting and as you start finding companions (they're all missable!) and learning more moves you get a pretty interesting combination of tactics! Battles are a rather standard affair otherwise, being turn-based. However there's no random battles, and enemies stay dead once defeated- they literally turn into a mushy pool of blood and bones on the map forever. And of course the animations of attacks are a pleasure to see and your foes have... interesting aesthetics, to say the least, so it offsets some of the monotony. At the end of each battle, you'll get Meat for the enemies you slayed.  Adding onto to that, death works differently here. Instead of the usual game over, you're put into a kind of hub only accessible by death. The Meat you found can be grinded to increase your HP- since there's no leveling up, at least not visibly as far as I know- so if you've saved some up the same enemy that killed you may not be so tough next time. I ended up here a lot at the beginning. I really enjoyed this, it's very different from pretty much any other RPG Maker game.  It's also fairly non-linear. There's the main path, of course, but hidden NPCs, companions, and items encourage exploration which is fun thanks to the fact that there aren't random battles. Usually, those discourage me from exploring freely.   So if you're a fan of RPG Maker games, or unique aesthetics and writing, this is for you. But it's also just a really solid game, and I'm surprised it has as much as it does. You can play through and disregard the bells and whistles and you'll still have fun, but for completionists or those who want an excuse to soak up more of Mason Lindroth's acid-fueled world, it's a good time.",
