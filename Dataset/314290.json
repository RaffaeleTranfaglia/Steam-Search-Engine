            "review_text": "Interesting mix of Binding of Isaac and Hero Siege. + Nice graphics-sounds. + Good variety of weapons, enemies and power-ups. + 5 different bosses. + It can be quite addictive for some time.  +/- Cleverly hidden secret room, but unfortunately there's only one... +/- The spells are a nice addition and can get you out of some pretty tough situations with minimum damage, however there's only three of them.  - It's very small since it took me 4 hours to gain every achievement (after that, there's nothing more to keep your interest in the game...). Normal mode took me about 35-40 minutes to beat and I finished it only on my second try, plus the hard mode isn't much more difficult and you'll finish it sooner or later. - There's an upgrade system with points and some stats e.g. power or health, but with the game being so small and the amount of available points to use being only 4, after beeting every boss, I don't think that where you spent them will make a significant difference. - The 5 different locations are few and get repetitive after some replays.  - Some times the movement of the character and enemies can get glitchy, thus leading to unnecessary deaths.  Recommended to anyone that has already spent a considerable amount of time playing BoI and Hero Siege who wants to try another game like these (but a lot shorter in duration), only if they find it in a good discount or as part of a bundle.",

            "review_text": "My first reaction was- 'Wait! Binding of the Isaac???'  I am not really a fan of Clones, I believe that they take out the hard work of another and turn it into easy bucks.  But, after playing this game, I honestly don't think that it is a clone. Hold on, I said it is not a clone, not a game completely original. It is not Binding Of The Isaac in its exact form.   The genre maybe the same, but this game has its own form of fun. Its an arcade-type game. You just go in and shoot the hell out of everyone/thing. It is a great pass-time. You need no concentration, no timing, no nothing. Just click and hold the left mouse button. The only thing you have to do is to make sure you are equipped with the right weapon.  Pros- * Pet Bats! Now who thought of that! * Pet dog, which can become rabid and kill everything at some point. * Good Background scores  Cons- * Saving is a pain. You can save only when you are at a shop (level). * As if spiders jumping around isn't annoying, the rats jump too!  7/10 for this indie game. Would obludia again!",
