            "review_text": "I haven't played this series since PCM 2009, while I hardly remember some of the features from PCM2009, I can say with confidence that PCM 2014 has a few items that can draw the player into the game - but there are other items that will draw you away. For one let's highlight the positive mechanics that I found in the game:  Beautiful graphics Relatively clean interface and menu Somewhat of a comprehensive tutorial Great in game commands R&amp;D feature was a step in the right direction  Some negatives:  Cluttered inbox, you'll get mail from a bunch of miscellaneous events that don't impact or pretain to your current game which I would just simply classify as spam (Something minor which can be easily fixed by zero'ing off the 'announcer/commentator under sound options) But the announcer sounds cheesy as hell, I don't even think ESPN announcers sound that bad.  If you haven't played PCM before, the tutorial might not be enough to properly introduce the game to you. There are many screens on the UI (not as bad as football manager!), it wil take some time to get used to it all. A few minor graphical glitches during the race that don't impact the quality of the game (cars driving through the race formation, racers 'ghosting' through each other)  It's hard to say what exactly needs patching as of right now, my first race was fine and I didn't encounter anything wild that needs to be addressed immediately. I would recommend this game to someone who is interested in cycling or management of cycling teams. would buy again 10/10.",

But this game doesn't make it easy to learn the game or the sport. The graphics look nice, I haven't had any crashes, there are loading screens but they aren't that slow, and the 3D races make it somewhat interesting. But... spending hours and hours racing in a sport and game I don't understand is not fun.",

            "review_text": "Update: After tuning down my graphic settings a bit, the game rarely crashes, and has actually become enjoyable. The season planning tools is a highlight in this years release, and is definatly something that makes this version a lot more enjoyable to play in comparison to older releases. Like most manager games, you'll need basic knowledge about the sport to really immerse yourself in the gaming experience, so I'd say that this game is still mostly for cycling enthusiasts. The AI is actually pretty realistic, like in real life, the Tour de France in my career had a pretty random outcome, since most of the favorites lost a lot of time on the cobblestone stage in Britain, was lucky to have my team captain in the front group, which ended up landing me a spot in the top 3.  The game as a whole looks better than last years installment. The UI is a lot more intuitive than in previous games of the series. The AI actually seems pretty well balanced, and it seems like computer controlled riders can also have a bad day, which can come in handy, especially in the stage races.",
