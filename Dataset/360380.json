            "review_text": "What do you get when you take elements of Transformice, World of Goo, and Poly Bridge (all of which being far better than this), throw them in a blender, and hit liquify? What you should have is a big mess, and that's exactly what you get with Tiny Bridge: Ratventure.  First off, this is quite obviously a mobile port. I was first suspicious from the startup resolution, which is locked at 1280x768. A 16:10 resolution, and a failry odd one at that. 'Any options to change it or go fullscreen?' You're kidding right? The options are almost non-existent, with your only real options being turning the sounds and music on or off. Not up or down,  on or off.  There's also a button on the main menu that gives a bare-bones tutorial, but we'll get to gameplay in a bit.  Your goal is to get your two mice to collect the glowing cheeses by making a bridge, and using as few pieces as possible to do it. One interesting thing I will give this game is that you're supposed to use your mice as counterweights to help balance the bridge in question. 'Wait, aren't bridges supposed to be stable?' Nevermind that for now! But yes. Sounds cool, right? You get to not only guide your mice to their goal, but make them be PART of the puzzle? Indeed, it doesâ€¦ it SOUNDS cool. Then you play it. And where do I even begin with the gameplay?  First, if you want a three-star, perfect level, there's literally only one way to do it: the way the hint button tell you to, and verbatum at that. If you deviate by any considerable margin or try to do it your own way, you won't get the perfect finish. Even if you collect all the optional cheeses and use less than half the parts given to you, you'll likely only get two stars, max. The hint button also makes the leaderboards moot, as everyone can just use the hints to achieve the perfect score (and many of the achievments if they have the patience).  Speaking of collection, there's a serious problem with hitboxes. Just look up screencaps of this game and you'll see that sometimes the mice will literally be touching the cheese but will refuse to collect it. 'Just reach out and grab it, you lazy cusses! D=&lt;' No, they have to be directly on top of it for it to count, and getting them to do that is a lot harder than it sounds.  While on the subject of lazy mice, sometimes the tall thin one will refuse to move along with the short fat one, making me wonder if there's something wrong with me or if it's the game. Has anyone else had this problem, and if so, how do I fix it?  Then there's the physics. Yeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh, they're not good, which is a real bad thing considering this is a bridge building game at heart. They're inconsistent, so much so that I've done the same thing several times in the same level and gotten different results. Tiny Bridge, you are not Bad Rats. Don't be like that.  To summarize, do you remember those three games I listed up at the top of the review? Play those instead. Yes, even Transformice.",

            "review_text": "So I just wasted my money on this disappointing game and stopped playing after 10 minutes. The sound and music is annoying and I needed to turn it off. The whole game feels like a cheap port of a flash game - there isn't even a fullscreen mode (at least I didn't see a settings button). And what about these in-game buy thing?? I paid the full price and you offer me 'moves' or tips to buy for 10% of the game price - this is ridiculous!  I bought this game as I was craving for a continuation of the genius 'World of Goo', as the mechanics seemed similar from the video. But now I'm just disappointed and ashamed I really 'spent' money on this game.

However, this is just my personal preference.    Pros:  - Game is rather simple.   - The physics are okay.  Cons:   - Redundant gameplay. Feels like you are playing the same levels over and over.  - 'Building' the bridge is VERY limited to what you can do.   - Game play overall feels a lot like Angry Birds; try and get 3 stars on every level to unlock more levels.  - The background music doesn't really help the 'fun' factor. It's cute, but hearing the same thing loop over and over gets old fast.   Again, everyone has their own opinion. This is just mine.",
