            "review_text": "I wasn't really expecting much of Blood of the Werewolf since I barely heard anything about it and it's release on Steam kinda went unnoticed for me. Well, I actually first installed it for the cards drop but while I was playing it I realized that this was not just another indie platformer to come out, this was something more. The more I played it the more I would compare it to Volgarr The Viking because from what I saw on the Steam store screenshots it looked nothing like that. Blood of the Werewolf puts you in control of a woman, which is also a werewolf, during her quest to save her child that was captured by monsters of the old world having killed her husband in the process and now she seeks revenge while a great soundtrack is played on the background to keep you just in the right 'spot'. The game is played both in form of werewolf which takes place when you are exposed to the moonlight and when you play as the woman which is usually indoors. When playing as the woman your weapon is a crossbow which you can fire a single arrow or two arrows at the same time depending on your 'spells' and upgrades that you've unlocked and most of the levels where you play as her is basicly using the crossbow to shoot key points to activate certain levers and platforms so that you can proceed to the next phase of the level. Now the parts where you play as a werewolf I find to be the strong part of the game, the werewolf has the ability to double jump and use a dash attack, which when airborne performs a dash downwards, along with other abilities which you can unlock such as using blood to heal yourself, blood works as the 'mana' of this game since you use it to activate your abilities and as the werewolf you have a melee attack which can have a 'charged' attack everytime you use it for the first time. Other things I really liked about Blood of the Werewolf was the voice over for the main character along with a certain wind mechanic which takes place during certain sections of the game which make you faster or slower depending on the direction of the wind and the direction where you're going. The graphicstyle along with the boring combat (atleast for me) are probably the weakest points of the game, while the game doesn't look bad it also doesn't look great, the graphics get the job done... and the combat while it's simple and efficient I'd like to see more variety to it like combos. The game is divided in various levels, some of which are exclusively boss fights which I thought that that they were really well made and designed focusing mainly on attack patterns which you need to avoid. The levels are made around various sections, some rely on tight jumping and precision platforming and timing while others rely on combat. At the end of each level you're awarded a rank (A, B, C ...) based on the time you took to beat the level (counting deaths) along with how many collectible shards you've picked up throughout that level. In the end, Blood of the Werewolf turned out to be a great surprise for me because it was alot better than what I was expecting and because it's actually a great game, very well put together and for that I recommend it to you if you're looking for a high precision platformer with some combat mixed into it. You can't go wrong with Blood of the Werewolf.",

            "review_text": "This game has poor level design. In an action platforming game this is damning. It's sad when the game gets some things right. The art style isn't too bad and the movie inspired title cards always made me smile. Even the map screen inbetween levels made me chuckle at how delightfully retro it was. I feel like retro was what this game was trying to go for. With a bit of Castlevania both the level's themes and the ideas behind the level design. However, everything in the levels just feels wrong. The levels are annoyingly long and up into a point very easy. But after the point is reached the level design nose dives into an unsaveable pile of garbage. Do yourself a favor buy another game. ARES does what this game wants to do far better.",

I'm so used to bad story in games that I was pleasantly surprised that Blod of the Werewolf didn't make me roll my eyes a single time. It's interesting and well done. The game has nice visuals too. And despite not being incredibly original, I like how you play some sections as a human and others as a wolf, and both have slightly different controls and you can upgrade them separately. Moving feels right, the directional to shoot feels great.   There is so much potential in this game, so many details they got right, that not recommending it feels wrong. But the level design is just not fun. Have you ever played Ninja Gaiden on the nes? remember those tiny platforms with almost impossible to beat enemies? Yeah, this whole game is that. If you need to jump expect something flying your way as soon as you're halfway through the jump. Trial and error games are difficult to make, the line separating unfun frustration and rewarding challenge is very fine. To me blood of the werewolf stands on the wrong side that line.  I'm also not a huge fan of the hit detection either. The wolf attacks look enormous on screen but have very little range in reality. But this could be easily overlooked if the level design went in a different direction.",

            "review_text": "This has possibly been one of the hardest games I have ever played. Blood of the Werewolf is a mix of Dark Souls and Mario, for the reason that it is a 2D platformer and will kill you more times than days in a year. It combines the aspects of classic platformers with their unforgiving demeanor, and the looks of a modern medieval-styled game. In Blood of the Werewolf the player takes on the role of Selena, a mother and wife seeking revenge on the various creatures of the night that killed her husband and kidnapped her son. All the events go on throughout one night, so when Selena comes in contact with moonlight she turns into her true form as a werewolf. Numerous cut scenes portray the story of her struggle to retrieve her son from famously known villains of old. Multiple stages allow the player to traverse unique levels and collect power-ups and sigils. In this game sigils, are similar to gold coins except that they reward with health increases and score boosts. There are a number of upgrades for both of  Selena’s forms that improve the crossbow or add more focus attacks for the werewolf. Overall the game poses a challenge and is nostalgic for those gamers that have been playing for twenty plus years and remember the original platformers. For anyone looking for a classic styled game that challenges the player to replay for completion, Blood of the Werewolf is definitely fits that description. At the price of $9.99, Blood of the Werewolf is available on the Steam Marketplace along with the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3.  ",

It was Quick Man's stage from Megaman 2 all over again without the benefit of being able to stop time.  Past that however its a good story, a good heroine for the main character, and... hell its a werewolf game, how can I not like that?  A platformer beat-em-up game split between slower paced sections where you're indoors as a human with a crossbow and outdoors as a werewolf, the story follows a mother out to rescue her son after her husband was murdered. Definitely worth a play if you like those older tough-as-nails platformers.",

I laughed when I died. xD Old school shooter/platformer reminiscent of the old NES days. Tight controls (don't listen to what other people are saying, they are probably just BAD at platformers. Sorry guys :/). An interesting Human/Wolf mechanic that forces quick adaptation. Beautiful aesthetics, ambiance, and music. Interesting, yet simple story. 'Learn as you go' mechanic with only subtle/necessary information being provided to help you adapt.  Cons: Can be HARD if you're new to platformers of the old school type (think Ninja Gaiden, Castlevania, etc.). Can be EASY if you're a seasoned platformer.  Having grown up in the Golden Days of NES gaming, I give this game an 8.5/10. I hope they continue making games like this.",

It's a fun game, but it's hard, hard for the wrong reasons though. Think Mega Man or Battletoads It requires you to die several times to learn the pattern of the level. Another problem I have is that one of the last levels has TWO NOTES! in the music and you die a ton of times learning how to navigate the level. After about 10 minutes I had to mute the music or I'd have gone crazy.",

Man I am sure glad i did because for 10 bucks its a deal but for a buck thats a steal.   if you're a fan of old school castlevania then this is the game for you. you can tell the developers were paying homage to one of their favorite franchises. castlevania fans will get the little nods here and there(what a horrible night to have a curse)  its 2d/3d side scrolling action at its best. whats unique is you play as selena who when your outside during a full moon transgforms into a werewolf. both characters play differently too. selena you are equipped with a crossbow that you can upgrade that has a special attack. using your mouse to aim while jumping adds a new element to th gameplay. the werewolf has a larger hitbox but can double jump and is a tank of a character. i love the story and the cut scenes are very well designed   Just like castlevania and ghost n goblins this game is diffucult. i would go so far as giving it the title of nes diffucult. you do have checkpoints which are often but even still some of the traps and stage designas are diffucult.   there are also other game modes to keep you busy a endless mode as well as a arcade type of mode to see who can rack up the highest score complete with leaderboards. plus with 1`25 achievements there is a lot of content here. i cant say enough good things about this game. as a fan of the old school side scrollers this pays tribute to them but updates it with a fresh look.",

            "review_text": "A difficult platformer that begins to skirt the level of I Wanna Be The Guy and Super Meat Boy (albiet the lower end of those for sure) at its more difficult parts. The game gives you a life bar, but later levels require perfect precision and constant movement otheriwse you fall into one of the many instant death traps, so at that point you may as well not have a life bar. The game has its fair share of 'dodge these three things perfectly, jumping out of them and simultaneously bringing an enemy on screen that throws a grenade perfectly into your jump arc', (as well a sCastlevania medua heads, though it's birds here) almost enough to make you want to bail on the game. The levels are fairly bitesize - about 20 minutes, and that was with me dying a strenuous amount of times and getting the lowest rank the game offers. If you're good at the game (I'm not) the levels are much swifter.  The game offers a story mode, a score rush mode, and a randomly generated Endless Mode, for plenty of high score getting and speedrunning fun. Not something that I'd want to grind on, at least not for this game specifically. Sprinkled through levels are also upgrades for the character in both human and werewolf form, as well as a vast number of Sigils to collect that raise your maximum health.  Several reviews complain about the controls being stiff, but I never experienced that at all. (I read there was a 2.0 patch - I never played the 'old version' of the game, so it's possible they were worse, but now they're very responsive.) The game is incredibly responsive in its movements, giving you perfect control over character momentum, on ground and in mid air, even when double jumping in werewolf form.  As I type this, the game is $1.99. I f you enjoy platformers and can handle the occasional amount of rage some of the more frustrating level design is going to give up (or just enjoy that sort of thing), the game is an absolute steal, especially if you intend to do the score attack stuff or try to get B/A/S ranks on all the stages.",

            "review_text": "This is one of the most underrated games that I have seen. I have no idea why it only has mixed reviews. It is a really solid platformer that I enjoyed just as much as highly acclaimed games like Trine, Guacamelee or Shovel Knight. Maybe it is slightly worse than those 3 but definitely not as much to justify such a huge difference in rating.  The game has 10 regular levels and 5 boss fights. The boss fights don't really have any replay value but the regular levels have a ton of it, which is one of the biggest strengths of the game. I replayed all the levels many times because I was motivated to get all the collectibles and complete each level in a fast time and without dying.  People who still want more after that can also play each level in a special 'Score Rush' mode, where you have to not only complete the level but also collect special tokens along the way to stop the time from running out. On top of that there is also an 'Endless Challenge' mode, where you have to complete as many rooms as you can in an endless procedurally generated level. You will notice the same rooms repeating somewhat quickly here but for me this mode is just a bonus on top of the regular levels, so personally I don't mind this.  The difficulty of the game was just right for me. It was challenging but never unfair. In most levels I died quite often during my first playthrough but after I became more familiar with the levels I could complete even the hardest ones quite fast and consistently.  In normal mode you have infinite lives and there are reasonably frequent checkpoints, so even bad players should be able to finish the levels eventually. Skilled players on the other hand should find quite a challenge in Score Rush mode when trying to get all the achievements.  The story is quite forgettable but I think this is the case in many platformers. The gameplay has a decent amount of variety, due to the two different characters that you play and a fair number of enemy types. I also liked the graphics of the game.  The later levels have a lot of instant death obstacles but with some practice you can definitely learn to avoid them and bring your death count to a low number. This is a not a hardcore platformer where you die all the time even when you know the levels.  I played the game with an Xbox 360 controller and the controls were mostly smooth and intuitive. The game specifically recommends a controller, so with keyboard it's probably not as great.  And finally there is the super low price. Even without sale the game costs only 2 euros! Don't let the price fool you. Maybe you think that such a cheap game can't possibly be good but this one really is. I have no idea why they are selling it this cheap. I would easily recommend it for 5 to 10 bucks as well.  I am nominating this game for the Steam Awards in the category 'I Thought This Game Was Cool Before It Won An Award'. (Yes, I know that it already has some awards listed on the store page but apparently those weren't enough to give it the recognition and rating that it deserves.)",

Yes you're going to die alot, and yes you're going to have to keep trying certain areas over and over and over before getting it right, but that's part of the fun of this genre, and given that you can just pick right back up from where you left off means that it's far from 'impossibly difficult'.... I haven't beaten the game yet, but I am thoroughly enjoying the challenge.  Another common complaint I am seeing in the negative reviews for this game is 'the story is weak' or 'beating the game isn't very rewarding', or 'I don't feel any connection to the characters'.... really guys.... just really?!?!?! This is a 2D platformer with a B horror movie theme, you were really expecting a strong story and characters you can relate with? I guess running through pipes, eating mushrooms and stomping on turtles is worthy of a friggen Oscar, because as Platformers go, you're not going to find a more well recieved series.... and as for characters you can connect with..... a short fat Italian plumber is really how you guys picture yourself? As for beating the game not being very rewarding..... one end game scene comes to mind from one of the greatest video game classics in history....... a futuristic armored warrior floating in space whose armor comes removed, revealing that this seemingly masculine cannon armed warrior was infact a blond female..... OH SNAP o.O, endings just don't get any better than that! Just sooooo cerebral.... it blew my mind!!!  At $1.99, I highly recommend this game to anyone who's into classic B horror and moderately difficult side scrolling platformers, don't even look back..... and I highly recommend that anyone else keep their $1.99 in their pocket, because you're probably going to judge the game unfairly.....

However, between the boring story, tedious gameplay, and sometimes laughable voice acting it's hard to believe this one will be worthwhile in the end.  The story is of a werewolf who is searching for her kidnapped son after their family is attacked and her husband killed. That's about as intereting as it ever gets. There's very little development past that with you just running from place to place looking for him without any clear reason why.  The voice of the main character is actually pretty well done, but the dialogue is often cheesy and uninspired. The other voices in the game however are laughable at best and cringe-inducing at worst. It's as a middle school drama club was attempting to replicate campy horror movies. (Maybe that's the intention as the setting and artstyle feel very campy at times)  The gameplay is overwhelmingly, the weakest part of the game. It's a side-scrolling combat-platformer of which there are a countless number of on Steam. The game alternates at predetermined points between playing as a werewolf or as Selene in human form with a crossbow. Neither is any more fun than the other and combat has very little variety. Just mash attack until the enemy is dead. There are also frustrating boss battles with bosses that have undodgeable attacks and plenty of cheap kills. The platforming sections don't fare much better and are perhaps even worse. They can be very difficult at times and checkpoints between platforming sections are too scarce. Unlike something like Super Meat Boy where the challenge is satisfying there's no skill involved in Blood of the Werewolf's platforming mechanics, just rote memorization. So you're forced to replay a platforming section over and over until you memorize every trap and even then one wrong move will send you back to the beginning as the design revolves around traps that kill you and require exact timing without a second of leeway.  I would not recommend Blood of the Werewolf. It lacks a compelling story, enjoyable gameplay, or really any reason to play it rather than any of the thousands of games like it.",

I wish I could post an actual review, but I couldn't make it 2 seconds without something going wrong with the video. As soon as the tutorial loaded up, my character would be surrounded by a white haze, which completely blocked me from seeing the environment (although I could still see my character). If I hit pause and resumed, the haze would be gone, but would immediately come back within a couple of seconds. This made actually playing the game absolutely impossible. It's very unfortunate, as I really wanted to play this game.",

            "review_text": "The biggest problem Blood of the Werewolf has is a remarkably inconsistent sense of difficulty. It swings wildly from insultingly basic and easy run and gun platforming to unforgiving hair pulling insta-death obstacle courses. Its clear Blood is intended to pay homage to popular old NES platformers, but it ultimately fails to capture that magic. It never seems to find a proper balance in what its trying to do. As I said, playing the game is a yawnfest until you run into a maddeningly difficult section exactly like the move-down-the-screen-as-fast-as-possible-to-avoid-the-insta-death-lasers part in Mega Man 2. Then it goes back to being easy and dull again. As a result, Blood manages to lack the enjoyment found in the games its trying to imitate.  Graphically, the game tends to be repetitive and uniteresting. Each stage is populated with mostly the same type of enemy; there's very little variation. Plus the stages themselves visually rely in one basic background design repeated ad nauseam producing a generic look and feel. This oddly contrasts with the short cut scenes which are the most polished and competent parts of Blood of the Werewolf.  The story itself is a fiarly generic vengeance plot sprinkled with common popular halloween fodder/famous literary monsters.  It also doesn't help your Werewolf form looks like a bald lion with a dog's tail.  The other distressing thing about Blood of the Werewolf is its an example of the indie industry's habit to inject retraded crap like gender politics into gaming. Nobody gives a flying F about the gender of what you play as. It has no factor in determining the quality of a game unless you've got a complete and obsessive fixation on gender or race politics that it psychologically prevents you from enjoying anything due to your warped perception of equality. Attempts to appease that demographic typically result in equally warped and out of touch characters because they've been converted from the original stereotype to suit that taste.  Blood of the Werewolf's protagonist is a perfect example; she's a man redrawn as a woman. I'm not saying that to insult or troll. She really is as agressive and angry as any cliched macho man manly male video game stereotype driven to kill a nearly never ending supply of people and critters on her mindless journey generally from the left to right side of the screen.  But then I realized something. Werewolf? Those involve full moons. Which happen.... Roughly once a month?  wow  and this... period... involves change, irritibility, irrational anger, and BLOOD...  WOW!  ok. I get it now. nevermind then! The main character's characterization actually is spot on and makes total 100000% sense now. Thanks  The $5 asking price isn't too bad. I can honestly say I've played games that cost the same but are much much worse. I can also say I've played better for the same price. I'd only recommend Blood of the Werewolf if its on sale.",

The game's controls are terrible on both the keyboard and controller. The levels are very poorly designed as far as platformers go. Definitely avoid this one.",
