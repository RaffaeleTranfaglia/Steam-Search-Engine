The movement, mech customizing and game experience is very much like the Armored Core series putting you in the action, allowing you to boost, skate, hover, use melee, fire weapons from your left and right hands and your left and right shoulders.  You can buy and equip upgrades to your mech, allowing you to change the arms, legs, torso, left and right hand weapons, left and right shoulder weapons and your backpack.You can even customize the appearance of your mech. You will also find a nice assortment of weapon upgrades to equip; light machine guns, medium machine guns, shotguns, shields, melee weapons, gatling guns, bazookas, grenade launchers, rocket launchers, missile launchers and more.  So really, if you are a fan of any mech style game then you will enjoy Front Mission Evolved.  This is definitely a game worth adding to your Steam library. :)",

You really had to work for your victories and fine-tuning your pilot's skills meshed well with the mix-and-match style of Wanzer design. I always looked forward to playing Front Mission games, even picking up the original 'remix' version for the Nintendo DS.   Having said this, I must testify that Front Mission Evolved betrays the classic formula that made the original Front Mission games so great. Instead of giving us Front Mission 4, which looked absolutely fantastic, they gave us this ridiculously lame version of From Software's Armored Core. None of the DLC makes a damned bit of difference, the controls are just terrible, the action is awkward, making you find little things around the map in order to get bonus achievements is idiotic and not fun, and the interface is a complete mess and very awkward. I'm under the impression that this is a terrible port of a console game because trying to navigate your way through the menus is just sheer torture.  Give us the turn-based variety of Front Mission, please. Spare of this derivative crap.",

If it had been done well, I would have been all for it. Unfortunately, the transition has been anything but smooth: the game tries to implement TPS gameplay with features carried over from the strategy days, such as weapon classifications and the maths system. The result is an unnecessarily clunky mess that attempts to appeal to both the veterans of Front Mission as well as new gamers, and succeeding at neither.  Combine the waywards mechanics with uninspiring and repetitive gameplay, writing straight out of the worst of animes, terrible voice acting, outdated graphics even for the time, and even spunkgargleweewee elements (the game begins with New York being under attack, no kidding), and you've got yourself a boring shambles that cannot be recommended to Front Mission fans, action gamers, shooter fans, mech fans or anyone else imaginable.

The problem here is, this purchase is apparently a crapshoot. if you have middling hardware, this is probably a good game to purchase and you'll have fun. Unfortunately, for those of us who have a machine with a powerful setup, such as SLI or Crossfire PCs, this game will suddenly run like you're trying to play it on a point-of-sale register computer. For reasons not known to man, this very common issue with the game is only resolvable by disabling your dual-card setup (i.e. turn off SLI) and chase it with *uninstalling any 3D drivers*. There are forums full of people who praise this as the solution.   Unfortunately I game in 3D and if I'm going to buy two video cards I'm not going to nerf my computer just to play a game I grabbed on sale for a couple of bucks. Disabling 3D isn't enough, you actually have to uninstall the drivers altogether and then reinstall them when you've decided you're done with this game. Otherwise, the more enemies you face, the slower it will get (we're talking 10-15fps against just three guys).  Too much of a PITA.",

I am however at this point gonna give it a thumbs up though because it is ten dollars and i believe it to be worth exactly that. First off the story isn;t too bad. I found it semi interesting with a slight twist at the end. The mechs are upgradable and in the last half of the game you will need to munipulate some upgrades around to suit your strengths and weaknesses. Is all in third person. There are points in the game where you will go without your mech. You will have a assualt rifle,rocket launcher, and grenades.Always. No upgrades for weapons or your person. Further more, Could have jsut been me but i was unable to find anyway to crouch or anything. Like there was objects to hide behind to avoid fire however being stuck in a standing position seemed to hardly help much.  The mechs fight is relativly fun. You can dodge, jump, jet around (on ground, not so much in air). You cna boost nito the air for a few seconds but it isn';t much and mobility is limited. You get a variety of weapons , bodies , and bases to use to upgrade and/or improve your mech. The graphics are ok, seem like from 10 years ago era if i was to put a guess on it. So yeah not sure what else i could type on this game without giving it away other than buy at your own disgression. Its worth 10 bucks at most. Maybe somthing cheap you and your friends could buy to dink around on playing localy, or if you just need to burn a few hours on some story.",

            "review_text": "I am a big fan of the Front Mission series, however this game takes the Front Mission setting and makes a game that is... basically worse than the Front Mission strategy gameplay in all aspects. It should really be called 'Front Mission Devolved'.  Youd think that they would put in some effort to justify switching Front Mission to a third person shooter, but it just feels like a cheaply made game.  The plot is laughable - the voice acting is very uneven (a lot of the characters are emotionless when they should show emotion, and ALL the emotional scenes fall completely flat) and it is just poorly written and generic. A major theme of the game is the incredible power of the 'EDGE System' which supposedly makes you into a superhuman mech piloting machine, but gameplay wise EDGE is pretty terrible. It only slows down enemies slightly for a few seconds and I hardly used it at all. The one badass female character turns into an emotional wreck halfway through the game just from seeing someone who scares her. The main character is as boring as you can get, with no real motivation besides 'revenge!' And the villains have massive plot armor, even after you fight them in a half hour boss battle their wanzers don't get a scratch.  The game's very hard to control with a controller so I would suggest using mouse and keyboard - ESPECIALLY in the (boring) on foot segments which will always crash if you use a controller. Even then however, the animations feel pretty stiff during combat. The on foot sections feel tacked on and even more like an attempt to make the game appeal to 'westerners'.  The graphics are also pretty poor. Even for the time they came out they were dated. The graphics look like a launch Xbox 360 game from 2006.  The music is of course generic without any of the incredible tracks such as the ones Yoko Shimomura made for the original Front Mission. While it's not horrible, it's also pretty forgettable.  All in all it would have been better if they just ported Front Mission 4 or 5 to Steam (and probably made more money too). The Front Mission series was merely the victim of executive meddling thinking a shooter would appeal more to Westerners. That may be the case but it certainly didn't result in a better game, even as far as third person shooters go.",

If a robot could eat all the things I loved about Front missions first, 3, 4 and 5 and then poop it out, this would be what you would find in the robot toilet. Double Helix=dooky.  On the other hand, try those other games I mentioned, they are all fun SRPG's. FM5 was translated by fans, and it came out awesome.",
