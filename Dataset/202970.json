            "review_text": "EDIT: I didn't excpect to make this review and make it the most popular review I made, but what ever, its the top of a super popular game over all the other reviews that actually review the game.  First thing is that you are here to see a review for the MULTIPLAYER and not the SINGLEPLAYER, (Campaign) there are way better games for that. The main reason I got this is because I always loved killing people and getting those radical killstreaks. Not for the campaign, but for the multiplayer. If you are here for the campaign, leave, campaign is about 6 hours long, and there is a lot better games for that, like Far Cry 4, got lots of hours in that for singleplayer only game time. If you are here for multiplayer, then get your wallet ready!  Some FAQ:  Q: Do people still play? A: Yes, at certain times and places. Where I am i can get a game quick from 10am to 10pm (West Coast, USA)  Q: Is it worth full price? ($60) A: No, I did not get it for full price, why should you. Buy on sale or through trading. (Key Trading bots/people)  Q: Should I use my controler? A: No, you will cry cause you get 0 kills.  Q: Can I read? A: Yes.  Q: Are you just making up questions to make this review longer? A: Yes.  Q: Why? A: Why not? Plus I can't think of them, so ask away!  Review for each part of the game:  Campaign- No, get other games, its fun but to short.  Multiplayer-  Better then most other CoDs. MW2 I own, to many hackers. MW2 being a good CoD. This game is one of the best and still has a strong community of people that make it hacker less.  I also own AW, its bad, and now 0 people are play, #2MuchDLC.  Worth the buy if it was just for this.  Zombies- Its another fun game, fun by youself and with others! Different from most zombie games.  Other Pros/Cons  Pros- -You get 3 games in your Library -You only have to download the part of the game you want to play, so less space used! -Not many hackers! Always a good thing   Cons- -So much paid DLC; a Gun thats super amazinly good, maps that I would like to play, skins. What is this CS:GO? Paying for skins is so CoD, oh wait. -Less 8 year olds, I like to talk to them, there fun to mess around with -Sadly no price drop, unlike MW2 and such old games.  So overall well worth the money for the Multiplayer/Zombies!  Original that made me famous: Still better then Call of Duty: Ghost Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare and  Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 combined!  omg is joke xd",

This game is ALOT better and has the same amount of players.  Pros: Generally an easy game. Easy to remember maps Played 1 year and a half after release. Zombies mode with new. never before seen characters. Changeable FoV Normally ALOT harder to hack compared to Infinity Ward CoD's (First Hand Experenice. Dont ask.)  Cons: Some really unbalanced guns on Multiplayer Horrible community Pretty Generic *modern warfare-esqe* campaign Pretty bad graphics, incredibly easy to max.  TL;DR : Get this if you have the suddern urge to own people and you like Zombies mode from WaW and Black Ops 1.  7.5/10 - Pretty fun game, but lacks in some areas.",

On this day I wish to grant you the privilege of witnessing the product of my musings in regards to this noteworthy piece of interactive entertainment.   Call of Duty: Black Ops II tells the tale of a wayward son who attempts to seek out the fate of his estranged progenitor. Several themes masterfully interlace and course through the story in regards to topics such as: kinship, consequence, and sacrifice; some subtle, and some apparent. This may appear to be rather antediluvian. Rest assured that it is not.   Of course, one must not neglect the defining characteristic of the selected media: Interactivity. Exultantly, I announce that Call of Duty: Black Ops II also excels in this regard. A diverse collection of firearms are available at your leisure and presented in an equipoise manner which the integrity of the plot remain unattenuated.   This impeccable mélange of elements is a true modern genesis. Truly antipodal to mediocrity; a chrysostomatic and puissant apparatus to the blooming intellectual.  ",

            "review_text": "Well, as a start I'd like to say that I didn't want to play this game for a fairly long time, I bought a deluxe edition in June 2013 (It had belt buckle, OST disc and Nukecity DLC). I installed it only around November of the following year and got to actually play it somewhat in beginning of May. And, yes, I underestimated it. The game itself looks better than its ancestors in fact, it is clearly seen at points, faces show expressions and the characters don't look like robots...The graphics did become better as well, comparing to MW3, it's made a decent leap. Everything, looks better, somewhat like Mirror's Edge especially to the end of the game when things start exploding (YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAH). The story is divided into three parts. Let me tell about every of them in short:  First story: As usual, flashbacks of Woods, who did survive in Laos (or it was Vietnam?..) Anyway, this looks pretty interesting, has some stupid moments, some ridiculous twists, but to be honest, I liked this part the most. It ends at somewhat middle of entire game  Second story: The main part, protagonist of which is son of Alex Mason, who follows old foe of his father and so on and so forth. This part takes place in 2025. it has some futuristic features, but all in all, the gameplay is pretty sample to first. I didn't like this one too much, even though it has a pretty charismatic character named Harper, and that it has the most conscious plot...The thing is that this part looks a lot like Crysis because of those future weapons and stuff. I know, that it hardly would look any different, if you want to make some close-future shooter, but still.   Third story: Is kinda the ♥♥♥♥♥iest for me. You command a squad that goes all around the world, defending different places from the main villain's troops. It's made as a tactical part of game, you have around 10 soldiers and machines under your control and you can control every of them on your own, but as tactics it's pretty useless...Choose all your troops and command to attack enemy, not a big deal. I finished it as well, so there.  The thing I did like about the game is the variety of endings. The thing is that the only two things you're going to care for are Woods and Harper, so that doesn't matter way much, but in game it is pretty exciting, to choose things, knowing it may affect the game  Sound is good, I really liked the ending, even though not fan of A7X, but yeah, pretty cool  I hardly played multiplayer, but it looks pretty fun too, a lot like MW2 which I did like  In the end, would I recommend this game? Yes, if you're afraid to waste your time on one more 'CoD ♥♥♥♥♥♥ shooter omg', then leave your fears, it's pretty decent even though pretty easy (played on hard difficulty, died only 7 times throughout the game, the squad was lost only once)  In the end, I'd say 8.4/10. Would have been better if not that stupid tactical feature Thanks for reading, play games!",

            "review_text": "I'm not a big fan of this  Call of Duty  like I used to be. Looking at it as a game on its own however, it has some great values within the  Call of Duty  series, the biggest one in my eyes being the choices you're able to do in the campaign to change the story. It is perhaps the truly innovative factor of this game, considering the franchise is known for not thinking outside the box and being repetitive.  One of my favorite aspects of the campaign's story is that I feel that the franchise finally got a villain with a real purpose, that you can even empathize with, and not a random terrorist seeking senseless war. The story is genuinely interesting and very well written, the timeline being split between the 80s and the future, in 2025. The section which the player rides a horse is probably one of the coolest gameplay moments in  Call of Duty's  campaign history. The cutscenes are extremely engaging too, you can't help but pay attention to them.  Speaking of which, the gameplay at the very core remains the same. This serves to both its benefit and disadvantage, it's good to feel the  Call of Duty  'essence' present while playing, but the vicissitude some were definitely looking for is lacking. The A.I. remains stupid, standing in your way and taking bullets. The new strike force missions leave a lot to be desired, and while they affect the story, they're thankfully not mandatory.  The multiplayer is the same one you know from previous games, however it implemented some very nice features. The league play mode, the much better designed emblem system, wildcards, and new game modes such as hardpoint and multi-team death match being some of them. Things that kinda bummed down my personal experience though were the removal of wager matches, CoD points, and some reticle customization, I digress though.  The theater mode returns better than ever, and I believe  Treyarch  tried their best in making this the most balanced  Call of Duty.  Nonetheless the map design this time around is unfortunately disappointing, and the DLC remains expensive and not worth the price. It is particularly bothersome that the Peacekeeper is the only new weapon available out of all the packs. I also thought it was strange not to see some of the 80s weapons in the multiplayer.  Zombies was flabbergasting to me. TranZit is simply  awful,  grief is lame, and the new characters are downright annoying and utterly unfunny crap, especially Marlton. I couldn't find the appeal to the map design nor the story in the mode up until Origin, which   turned out to be false.   There are some gameplay design decisions that'll simply make you ask  why,  such as the fact that they've only included the very desired AK-47 in the map Mob of the Dead.  It feels incredibly worthless to make a world map to include just a very small amount of locations as well, when I saw that I was sure they would make a Rezurrection-kind of DLC which would emcompass classics such as Kino Der Toten and Ascension, but instead they wasted it in more poorly made multiplayer maps. Thankfully, the soundtrack of this one remains solid, for the most part. Including artists such as  Johnny Cash,   Avenged Sevenfold,  and  Malukah.  Sadly,  Elena Siegman  only returns in one song on Origin.  Kevin Sherwood  still wrote excellent songs for the mode though.  This is far from being the best  Call of Duty  in the series, but  Treyarch  did a solid job, especially with the campaign. It manages to be significantly refreshing and fun, despite its issues.  7.3/10.0 ",

The only down side about this game is that it's pricey but it's an amazing game. The Single Player has an amazing story line as well as different choices for replay value. You also get to customize what your character uses in the single player mode. The Multiplayer has been one of the best since Cod 4 and has guns from all our favourite past CODs and have nerfed some guns to make them more balanced although i have not played that much multiplayer this is due to the fact of playing countless hours on the other CODs and i'm just bored of playing it's Multiplayer. With a high price tag many people may not get this but you can find the game cheaper else where and the dlc bundle on sale for $35. This is one of the most expensive games i've owned but i think it's worth the money. The game is more fun to get with friends. It's such a shame that Cod games have to be so expensive if they were slightly chepaer they could make more money. With the default prices being $90 for the base game, $70 for the dlc bundle the game is rather pricey and $110 for the digital deluxe edition which unlocks you the soundtrack, nuketown zombies map and a copy of call of duty world at war the game is still rather expensive. They should make the game $100 with all DLC or something even then it's still really pricey. But the game can be bought chepaer outside of steam but there's no way around to paying $70 for the season pass unless it's on sale. The zombies is by far the best zombies out of World at War and Black Ops. There is the classic Nuke town as well as proper zombie story line and different maps which require different things to complete as well as fighting different types of zombies. Travel on a bus set up teleporters you name it the zombies is amazing but i find it rather difficult to solo so it's best to play with friends.

The Balancing of the weapons and the gear is good, most of the guns are seen and some of them are so good that they are played the most (dont get me wrong, they aren't 'op'). The Campaign is awesome like in the game before and the Zombie Modus is EPIC! The Basic Maps are fun and with the DLC Apocalypse you can play Origins and 4 Muliplayer Maps (worth to buy!!!).   Negative Aspects? Sometimes there are hackers, but u can report them ingame easily and they mostly get kicked (their mfgdao) pretty fast.

Call of Duty games of late have not been very variable. The campaigns have been basically mission after mission of shooting into huge crowds of enemies while trying not to be killed, and the multiplayer's just been the same over and over again, but with minor changes. With Black Ops 2, however, this has changed slightly, and for the better. The campaign does have its fair share of shooting and running and craziness, but there's also some stealth elements mixed in there, as well as some interesting new mechanics, for example the Millimeter Scanner which can detect cloaked enemies, and the real-time strategy-esque'Strike Force' missions. This, on top of a surprisingly good storyline, helps to breathe a little new life into the ageing Call of Duty series.  The multiplayer's had some changes as well - Whilst retaining the gameplay of previous games, new weapons and attachments make the game just a bit more interesting. In addition, the Create-a-Class menu has been completely reworked, now allowing players to select more than one attachment by default, as well as the new Wildcards, taking some of the Perks from previous games and reworking them.  All of this makes Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 one of the better Call of Duty games, up there with Modern Warfare. If you're going to play any Call of Duty game, this game is not a bad choice.",

            "review_text": "Alright, now that Apocalypse is out, I'll try and do my best to create an elaborate review of Black Ops II.  Let's start off with the campaign, I found it was kind of good in some ways, I mean it is really good, with a pretty decent story and the addition of you making the choices of getting a different ending, but I found that the characters didn't felt that good like it did in Black Ops 1, and as for a sequel story, I didn't like many of the old 20th century missions, there's probably too many of them in my taste, and in a mission with Mason, there's the 'numbers' again, but that was just bad..   You can ride a horse, do a wannabe RTS things here and there, get to fly a jet, make your decisions on different events of the campaign, I think they're actually stepping up their game.  Multiplayer: Ooh boy this is the hard part, with success always comes the haters... As for the gameplay I found it was very fluid and smooth and the maps are amazing, with these 'new' graphics. One reason I pick Black Ops and Black Ops 2 over the Modern Warfare Series (Excluding MW1) is the colors, this may sound weird, but indeed these games have clear colors, and bright ones too. This game is like my pick and play if I'm in a good mood, since everytime I play I feel like I achieve something with the level system, or trying to get gold weapons, which is a pretty good system to get you busy for a long time.  Zombies: Alright so I'm a fan of Zombies in Call of Duty, in this one I could clearly see they were going for something different: TranZit, which was the worst map in my opinion. When on the bus, power station or going from one place to the other in the fog, the game has a slight chance of Crashing, and also the fact that not many people play in PC, I should've put this in the Multiplayer bit too, trying to find a match in Zombies takes around 10 minutes but don't get too excited if you find at least ONE person to play with, since the maps worth playing are HUGE, and there are quitters all over the place. I would recommend getting a friend to play with. The stock game comes with 4 maps, Tranzit, Bus depot, town, and farm, each one being a place in Tranzit as a stand alone map. These maps are boring once you've played them a lot, but No one plays Tranzit, because everyone plays Town, so the stock game in Zombies is really bad.  As for the buildables, I loved the portable engine to power up stuff, the Zombie Shield I never saw anyone use it and it is on all maps, which is the worst thing they could've kept for all maps... As for Grief, No one plays it, I never played it, I didn't like it either, I rather play zombies in a coop way.  Revolution: I liked it, got it when it was coming out, 4 original multiplayer maps, a new Multiplayer weapon, the Peacekeeper which I used a lot, a very good zombies map, Die Rise, really felt like CoD Zombies.  ... Oh and a new gamemode, wow I even forgot that existed because no one plays it, so I never got to play it, although the idea sounded pretty good, as for you turning into the zombie.  Uprising: Amazing Maps, a remake of Firing Range, a classic from Black Ops 1, and Mob of the Dead, probably the best zombies map in BO2 by far. Sadly, no new weapon or anything fancy.  Vengeance: Probably the only reason that I have to get it is the Cove map, everything else doesn't look convincing, and Buried looks too easy. I didn't get it, but my call is to wait until it goes on sale.  Apocalypse: Maybe the only reason to get this is Origins, a really fun map, although hard, but to learn everything hidden in origins is quite the job, and I really like it. Only thing I didn't like is the combination of steampunk robots in a 1918 era with also the templars, just wasn't too good. As for multiplayer goes, 2 reused maps, not apealing, but I didn't have stadium from Black Ops 1, so that only makes 1 reused map, which isn't a big surprise Treyarch got lazy at the last DLC...",

            "review_text": "Great game, a lot of bad commentary in the beginning i heard, definitely worth buying, but i 'd wait for a steam sale! Zombies are great, multiplayer is great (no FMG9's like in mw3 or something bad like it), only downside i could find is the campaign being quite short (i ll explain later). The game itself is worth buying !!.  About Multiplayer: It's balanced as it gets with these games, you ll always find a particular gun being better then another one. but not with major differences. The community online is nice (as far as it gets with fps games). The maps are somewhat small and short in numbers but buying the Revolution DLC remedies that with +4 maps ++1 zombie map + 1 NEW GUN (PEACEKEEPER) A GREAT GUN ! but requires playing a little bit tactically. ALTHOUGH THEY SHOULD HAVE ADDES A GAME MODE LIKE INFECTED IN MY OPINION.  About Zombies: Well.... just great no downsides , it would have been amazing if they 'd add kino der toten though (which is sadly not the case).  About Campaign: It's a nice story altough I don't really like it that every character is using cheap language so OFTEN. I mean every now and then like Capt Price in the MW series is GREAT and I had connection with that guy somehow, but I didnt had that connection with any character in this game. the bad language is a little bit overkill. I mean I actually had some raw feelings when sandman, grinch and truck died in mw3 at the 'down the rabbithole'mission. But I really didn't had that in this game.  Further: the story seems to be never reaching that special point where as you might think: hey let's do this campaign again. until you get to the mission where the bad guy is imprisoned and from that point it gets really good. but I think its sad this game advertised with drones taking over, which made customers think hey the game is about drones taking over, but very sadly this take-over-thing only lasted for about 2 missions. So the campaign gets nice really slow (this is bad, personally I 'd liek to be dropped in the middle of the action, like in MW3) and then it reaches it's peak at a very strange point in the story, and then that peak is gone in a flash and everything gets really boring again.  That's it really for my review. I think they could have made it better if the player could spend more time with like woods alone and have some good talk. but instead woods plays some bad-♥♥♥ vietnam-veteran and doesn't want to talk but only curse every single human on the planet, which is the downside on his character and which is also why I couldn't really find myself in this character ( to get this personal bond) same goes with harper, I chose to let him die and let farid live. I had more flow with farid rather than with harper which is weird because Harper is in about every mission, and Farid in just 3.    Improvements  I think possible improvements with a good testteam would be: - Less cursing and calling names in the campaign - larger maps in the multiplayer - removing 80% of the lava in zombies - removing 30% obstacles in zombies (it's just anoying) - less recoil for the peacekeeper smg or making it a 3 shot kill instead of 4, I think a gun which requires a DLC to be bought should at least be on par with the best gun in the default game or very close to it. - it would have been cool if they added the browning hi-power / m11911 to the multiplayer ( cool old school stuff) - the an-94 and the scar are slightly better than the other guns and very popular, i think the scar should be a 20 round mag weapon like in mw2 and the an94 should receive more recoil. - the scorestreaks take a long time to get i think they should be set at -50 points. example: Hellstorm missile is 700 points, in my opinion it shouild be 650. just al ittle easier to get. - groundwar should have a build-in function that score streaks are obtainable at 2x rate. because none really gets scorestreaks in groundwar like ever. only those 10-year old noobs who cheat/hack or play too much. - snipers should be nerfed : ADS time should take longer, and snipers should only be able to shoot accuratly when aimed in completely to get quickscoping out of the picture. - LMG's should have mroe damage output, equiping these things is making you slow anyway so there s gotta be something good on the otherside instead of only a larger clip of ammo.  What I think is good: - its not only AR or SMG game play at least these two are now used variously. - being able to extend your game via DLC's (although they overkilled the amount of DLC's here) - quite good ballanced multiplayer, - chat-option - being able to mute everyone instead of just one player - after prestiging the game holds your tokens to the guns you spent tokens on  Advise to Treyarch : don't make it taht obvious you want my money! 15 euro for 4 maps and an extra is a little too much.   SUMMERY _________  -GREAT GAME  -GOOD MULTIPLAYER -GOOD ZOMBIE SURVIVAL -GOOD DLC's (advised: Revolution DLC) -ABOUT 6-9k players @ multiplayer at the mid of the day -MEH CAMPAIGN -MEH CHARACTERS  I do recomment this game, but I 'd value it at about €35,- right now   Hope to see new players soon ;)  ",

More fun than any other call of duty campaign I've played (waw1,waw2, blops1). I suggest playing on veteren, because it makes it more challenging and 'realistic'  zombies: Great. Very fun with multiple people, extremely difficult alone. I haven't played very much, but it's a fun game mode that absolutely requires teamwork and quick thinking, as well as a bit of luck. Pretty fun overall.  Multiplayer: Amazing. Definately my favorite game in this genre. Huge amount of customization and playstyle. Lots of rude people (but not as much as the internet would have you believe). Many different maps and gamemodes keep it from getting boring, and you level up faster when you try different weapons, so the game encourages you to spice it up a bit.  I highly recommend this game to anyone that likes multiplayer shooters, but if you do decide to buy it, try to get it when it's on sale, because they've kept the price pretty damn high for it being 3 year old game.",

The game play is standard call of duty with some new flavors added but the actual story itself was enthralling. The best word that comes to mind is haunting. I usuaully am not startled or shocked by graphic content but some of the scenes depending on how you play are chilling.   It's a shame that the game crashed as often as it did, pretty much every other mission it would crash and black out the screen of my computer and the only thing I could do is restart the entire machine. This got pretty old quick, especially when you're going for a no death run on veteran and it crashes 75% of the way through or even worse, at the end cut scene.   Even with the fault in the programming, I still love this game. With that being said, I wish they would of expounded more on the campaign's 'decisions' to let you fail. The game has moments that depending on your preformance will effect the outcome of the story usually affects certain dialogue sequences but I would of really liked it if some of the choices actually changed the entire outcome of the story all together, even bypassing or presenting alternative missions. I understand that they had a lot to work on, especially with the ramped up zombies mode and the ever popular multiplayer being a key focus. However, stuff like the avenged sevenfold cameo, while entertaining, was something that I couldn't help but think that the time spent on making that scene could of been used to make the game itself better.   The following is spoilers so if you have not played the game, be aware that the following will ruin the story for you. I love the villian of this game, by far he has been my favorite. He is well thought out and his motivations not only make sense but you genuinely feel for the guy. While I am very happy to see woods back, I thought that he was a little out of place. The only thing that didn't really make sense was why woods hated menendez so much. I understand that he's a bad guy and they are against him, but what did menendez do to him? I'm pretty sure kravchenko was the one that was responsible for torturing him but was handed over to menendez. I guess he blamed them both equally.   The story does a solid job at showing the price of conflict. Most games come off really pretentious when they're talking about the horrors of war but this game simply nails it. Easily the most haunting scene I have witnessed in modern gaming, when they finally show his sisters face at the end, I got chills. I got even more chills when he joins her. I love that about Treyarch, while they may not be the best programmers, they are incredible story tellers. Also I really enjoyed the fact that the game uses a lot of current real world tech to show off the possible future that we are looking at but also able to blend it with traditional game play of the previous black ops that helped finish that story.  I do wish they would of gotten Ed Harris to return as the voice for Hudson instead of replacing him with Michael Keaton. His portrayal ends up coming off as more ice cream than ice cube. I don't understand why they didn't just make a new character for this game, Hudson was a CIA handler and they could of just as easily assigned them a new one. That was really the only complaint I had with the story mode, the rest of the voice acting is really solid ESPECIALLY woods. James Burns is a fantastic voice actor and I would really like to see him come back in future installments to lend his talents.   Overall, this has been my favorite call of duty game in the series. I cannot recommend it highly enough, but to be honest, it might be better to get it on console. I had a nightmare of a time getting through some of the levels without the game crashing. If you can stomach the bugs for the story then I gaurantee you will not be disappointed, I only wish that I could of played the game when it was new and gotten to experience the online features in their prime.

Going to do review of COD BO2.I have played every COD game,and completed all until Advanced Warfare.Been playing COD for years,back in 2007.So finally wanted to do review for this game. I have completed it on xbox 360,i can say story is really good,like in most COD games.Bought on PC only for Multiplayer.And i can say,that it wasnt worth... Multiplayer: It has tons of game mods,game is fun,until you run into lobbies with hackers.3 TIMES IN A ROW playing NukeJacked found hackers.Quite brilliant I can say.Community is a cancer,everyone flamming and shouting.I was hoping for better experience,but I will better play COD WAW or any other COD,but not this one. Rating: Story 9/10 Multiplayer 4/10 Overall 6.5/10 If you are looking for a strong story line based game,ye go get it,but if u want to play only Multiplayer,think twice before you buy.I can reccomend it if you get it for around 20€,but definetly not worth 60€.",

Also, the frame rate is not locked at 91!!!!!!!!!!! YAY! This is brilliant as Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 and post Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 games, the frame rate was always capped at 91 FPS, which is very good, however, the FPS (Frames Per Second) I like it to be unlocked, This is due to freedom and flexibility! (however this can become and issue) The reason this can become an issue is stability. V-Sync is there for people whos' 'rig' can go up to 145 FPS+ but drop down to 60 FPS. In a gun battle you know the FPS drop.  Still, 10/10 from me! Me like many others played Call Of Duty: Ghosts and did not like it, therefore, sold it/refunded it and continued playing this game! Although I have only 20 odd hours on the game , I still enjoy the game! It can frustrate you in a way no other game can! :)  The only issue I have with this game is not intertwined with the game itself, however, the people who play it, i.e. toxic players. You have players who are too competitive and try their hardest, which is not a bad thing, however, I play Call of Duty for fun and recreational purposes only.",

Even though it's set in 2025 we still get the possibility to re-feel the Cold War days of CoD with some really good missions (better than the ones set in 2025)   2) Gameplay - Well i'm not a fan of futuristic FPS games but the new tech implementations were not all bad , mehh for me though, fortunately the game gives you the possibilty to play with older guns even in 2025.  Final Verdict - 8/10 from the Black Ops series , Black Ops 1 is still my favorite but this one is still good and way better than BO3.  As a longtime player of the CoD franchise just like everyone i wish CoD would go back to the Cold War or WW2 days.",

Im not saying they couldn't be improvements because there can. The gun balance is good except maybe LMG's to be nerfed a bit. (people say shotguns are OP, the remmington 870 is op but put it this way, he can only kill you when hes close to being in your face, use distance to your advantage because as they say, from far away 'it won't hit the broad side of a barn'). The maps is playing on pc are very nice and graphics are great, maps are well designed and balanced. Killstreaks are my favourite out of all the CoD's, they are rewarding and good. They make the game worth playing. Striving towards them is always fun. The camo's I love and just using weapons you dont't normally for their xp rewards is great as well. To improve, definetly the free for all spawns, they ruin the fun and just getting killed repeatedly till the end isnt fun, you can be the best in the world but not get a single point. Other than that I would give the game a 9/10...",

            "review_text": "The campaign is salvageable, it offers a few fun missions to play and even replay to see a different outcome like the endings (or get more achievements if you care about those) which was a really good addition to CoD. But, the campaign isn't as epic as Modern Warfare 1. The Strike Force missions were a cool new addition but poorly executed and very frustrating, the unit AI wasn't on the top, I almost lost them on most occasions. With Zombie mode, the same can be expected as previous Treyarch CoD that offered that mode although, I'd still say Left 4 Dead offers a more satisfying experience.   PROS: +Campaign is interesting and offer decent playtime. +Story choices are often tough and encourage replay. +Amazing soundtrack and theme by Trent Reznor, Nine Inch Nails' frontman. +Strike Force missions are an innovative play (even if I didn't like them).  CONS: -Unstable and very buggy at release (a year later, game is finally playable). -Extremely linear experience. -Lots of invisble walls, forcing you to head towards the developers chosen direction or do a specific action to trigger a pre-rendered lame animation. -Vague objectives at times. -Enemy A.I's. always focus their fire on you instead of easier friendly A.I. targets nearby. -Strike Force missions were beyond annoying on Veteran difficulty setting. Limited replay from the points system. Poor friendly A.I. makes it close to impossible to beat it which made me skip those missions entirely. -NO DEDICATED SERVERS FOR THE MULTIPLAYER... meaning, don't play this game online as it is pointless. Get Battlefield 3 instead for online play. -Zombies mode is stagnant (doesn't offer anything new but you can expect the same thing from previous Treyarch Zombie modes).  OVERALL: I played this game for like, 3 hours at the game's release and lost interest at the campaign's Strike Force missions. The SF missions really annoyed the hell out of me especially if you failed a SF mission, you had limited replay points to change the outcome. So now, a year later and after having played CoD Ghosts, I can honestly say that I preferred Ghosts than Black Ops 2... in fact, I'd say Black Ops 1 was better than its sequel. Ghosts was more forgiving and the hit detection system seemed more refined too.   RECOMMENDATION: I would say that BLOPS 2 would be an acceptable addition to the series but please, buy it at a reduced price! Ain't worth spending the big bucks for the campaign alone!

Many recycled ones from earlier CoDs. - Lag comp is HORRIBLE. Enough said.

If you play custom game or solo map it works; however, the map will load exremely slow (as stated before.) In custom game, your friends would be able to join you after the loading is done and you are in the game. It's a wonderful game, but after trying it out on PC, I wouldn't recommend it. I spent most of my time on it trying to find the solutions to the problems I faced in the time that I played it, rather than enjoying the game itself. It wasn't worth the $20. I mean, I suppose I don't have it as bad as the people who wasted $60, but it's still money that was wasted.   P.S. There are videos on how to fix the slow loading maps issue, but I think the game is the problem.  P.S.S. I got someone else this game, and it works perfectly for them.

Only problem is, to get the good ending, you NEED to complete 4 strike missions    5 if you fail to rescue Chloe from DeFalco.    and the strike force missions are very annoying and tedious to complete.    Except for the one where you assassinate Tian Zhao     -Last good multiplayer. Nothing beats MW2 for MP, but this is also very entertaining. Black Ops II is the last time I even bothered playing MP in a COD game.   -Great zombies. It started off rough though. ♥♥♥♥♥♥ maps like Transhit and Die Rise made people very uneasy playing the zombies mode on BOII, but it all changed when Mob of the Dead was released. Black Ops 2 zombies has the 2 best maps ever made, even though I personally think Black Ops 3 Zombies as a whole was better.   -Great graphics  -Great voice acting  -Avenged Sevenfold segment at the very end brings tears to the eyes  BUT, there are a few cons. -Story is a bit too short. I was kind of disappointed at how fast I completed the campaign.  -Way overpriced. Don't get me wrong, it's a great game, but this game came out 4 years ago. And it's STILL 60 dollars, not even including all DLCs. Get it when it's on sale like I did.   -Tranzit  -Can glitch out. (Very noticeable in campaign. Had to restart missions a few times due to AI not moving, or story not progressing even though all enemies were killed)  -Many people experience a crash on startup. They will receive a message 'Unhandled Exception Caught' There is a solution (verif integrity of local cache) but they need to fix this error, as it reappears with each Steam AND Windows update (for me)   Final score: 9/10",

            "review_text": "Before reading this review, do not be fooled by my hours played, as they only represent my hours on the campaign. My real hours played is much higher, around 150+ on the multiplayer.  Call of Duty: Black Ops II is considerably better than a lot of the other CODs on Steam. If you want to play Zombies, prepare to pay £34.99 extra for the Season Pass, because the map that comes with the game (Green Run) is crap. The campaign is the only COD campaign so far with multiple endings. It is also one of the best campaigns. Multiplayer is very fun, with great customisable options for your class. If you want to play multiplayer and you own the Season Pass, you will need to disable the DLC in your library otherwise matchmaking will be narrowed down so you can only play with other Season Pass holders. And considering the fact that the peak multiplayer players for the last 30 days was about 5,500, you will struggle to find even a Team Deathmatch game with the DLC maps enabled.  The optimisation for the PC port of this game is quite good, and it runs a lot better than Advanced Warfare, Ghosts and Black Ops 3. The port has a variety of options, such as an FOV slider ranging from 65 (console default) to 90. However, the port is not flawless.  Ever since I have updated to Windows 10 (29th July 2015, its release date), I have experienced severe screen tear on Black Ops 2. I checked Black Ops 3 and the original Black Ops, and I get screen tear on both of those games too. I did not want to use V-sync, as that would cause mouse acceleration, severely affecting my aim, so I enabled 'Windowed (fullscreen)' as my display option for the game. This stopped the screen tear, however my frames per second were considerably lower. I turned on V-sync, which solved the FPS lag and locked my framerate to 60. For some reason, when I use V-sync with 'Windowed (fullscreen)', I do not get mouse acceleration, even when using V-sync. This fixed my problem, however this is an example of some of the problems this port has.  If you can't be bothered to read that review, here is a pros and cons list:  Pros: - Multiple campaign endings - Good multiplayer customisation - Good options menu - No aim assist for controllers - Good Zombies maps in the Season Pass (Origins, Mob of the Dead, Buried) - 90 FOV - Alright PC optimisation  Cons: - Screen tear (most people are not affected) - Green Run is awful - People calling you a hacker 24/7 - Lack of Season Pass holders in multiplayer - Lack of players altogether (around 5,000 in mutliplayer on PC compared to 60,000 on 360)  Only buy this game on sale or on sites like g/ 2/ a . com (sorry I had to space out the website address, as the website is a censored word). Only buy the Season Pass if it is on sale and you mainly want to play Zombies.",

        {
            "review_text": "For this reduced price (30€) I can certainly recommend the game. The multiplayer is solid, like pretty much every Call of Duty. There are a few innovations over Black Ops and Modern Warfare 3, like the revamped killstreaks, the class creation system, weapon unlocking mechaning, and some pretty unique weapons. The maps are alright, nothing to special there. I can recommend Nuketown 2025 and Hijacked the most since I always seemed to have the most fun on them. I don't really like the perks since some of them like 'Dexterity' or 'Toughness' are just pretty much no-brainers and you always end up taking them no matter what, really hurting variety in the respect. Same goes for the weapon pool in some respect, I'd have liked to see more than 4 weapons in the majority of categories. The only categories that DO have more than 4 weapons available are Assault Rifles and SMGs, everything else doesn't offer much variety. As for weapon balance, its pretty good fram what I experienced. There a some, if very few over/underpowerd guns like the 'Executioner' which is a terrible shotgun-revolver-thingy, and some that are mostly stronger than everything else in its class like the 'AN-94'. That's another problem right there: Since the classes mostly only have 4 weapons available, its pretty common that one gun kind of trumps that class. For example, there are 4 LMGs. Two of them are Beltfed and the other two are magazine based, which leaves te first two with larger magazines and longer reload times, while the other two are the exact opposite. One of those LMGs in each category is more long-range and the other more short-range capable. Now, one of the first attribute is going to end up being better than the other one. There is just no balancing right there, it's more or less a fact. Same goes for the second attribute, which leads to one gun of the four of them being the best allrounder, even if it lacks a few skills the other guns have. And that again leads to you, and most people online just using that one gun in every class. I would like to tell you can use these guns situtaionally, for example if you play a long-ranged map like Metldown you can use the long-range HAMR, or if you play a short-ranged one like Nuketown you just use the QBB LSW. But you can't really do that unless you're willing to actually go out of your way and pay anoter 1,99€ for a slotpack DLC, because you only get 5 custom classes by default! That doesn't leave you with much flexibility when it comes to choosing situatinal weapons, because if you're anything like me you'll want to have at least one custom class for every weapon category, and not four classes just for LMGs. Also, if you're going into this thinking of quickscoping, I have to tell you that you're probably better of with anoter CoD that suits itself better to that. Don't get me wrong, its perfectly possible but due to long zoom-in times with pretty much every sight and extremely slow firerates AND bolt-action prolonging time inbetween shots, it's pretty damn challenging since you can get mowed down so very fast. If you do want to try it out though anyways, I can safely tell you that the 'Ballista' with an ACOG-Scope is by far the best candidate for quickscoping.  I think that's all I wanted to say. For 30€ (Or your reginal equivalent) I can definetely recommend this game for all the fun I had, which do almost completely shadow the flaws I just mentioned for awareness purposes.

Multiplayer was a regret to try, I dont know why I expected it to be any different. It's full of whiny kids getting annoyed when they're killed, unrealistic shooting, knifing and gimmicks.

The engine is simple, which makes the game really responsive. A large variety of customization is available, even without the DLCs. Unfortunatlely, the PC CoD community isn't all that big, which makes for some game modes that aren't being played as much. I'd really recommend it to anyone who likes fast-paced gameplay or has enjoyed any other game from the Call of Duty franchise.",

Despite reporting them, action being taken against them is slow. This would tempt other players to hack as well.

The story was quite short it only took me roughly 13 hours (steam says I have less but I played alot while on a plane ride so it didn't track hours). The story is very interesting and I'm glad they atleast tried to intertwine with the Black Ops story. I mainly bought this game for zombies and campaign and the zombies is great. A lot of people hate on tranzit but I find it enjoyable. The multiplayer isn't very fun and isn't very active as most COD titles are on PC after a year or two.

The campaign is a tad on the easy and on the short side, but who plays Call of Duty for the campaign anyway? Where this game really shines is in its refined multiplayer mode. FIrst of all, Treyarch introduced the 'Pick Ten' system for a ridiculous amount of customization in your loadouts, which gives COD a huge breath of fresh air. Another aspect changed is the Killstreak system, which is now a Scorestreak system. This new system rewards players for playing the objective instead of just getting kills; No more camping for you! Along with these new features, the futuristic ambience, the weapon selection, and map design make the multiplayer feel top notch. Last, but definitely not least, there is Zombies mode. Levels that are designed with a story in mind, and new craftable items makes the Zombies mode better than ever. Call of Duty: Black Ops II is a very well rounded game, and if I were to recommend any Call of Duty, it would be this one. 8.5/10",

Cons- .Strike team missions.While they are pretty good....but when i am buying COD ,I am not really looking for strategy.It disrupted thepacing of the whole campaign. .Campaign not upto the COD standards.

            "review_text": "  Singleplayer:    Approximately 6 hours long, it's what you'd expect from a CoD Campaign. It's pretty much a non-stop interactive action movie with a good variety of guns (of which you can choose in your loadout before a mission) and, you guessed it, quick time events. The story is decent but I felt that the Strikeforce missions were subpar. I would describe them as RTS x FPS x Wave-based shooter missions that had objectives to complete, but I just felt like they were a fill-in for the (in my opinion) short single-player campaign. I enjoyed the futuristic setting, but I just felt like the overall presentation was slightly lacking. Having said all of this, I have to say that I did enjoy the singleplayer but, if that's what you're wanting to pay $90 for, then I'd suggest you give it a miss.    Multiplayer:    Unless you've been living under a rock for the past number of years, you're most likely interested in CoD because of the multiplayer (or Zombies...). I put a tad over 40 hours into it (because I joined the party late... 2 years late, that is) and, I have to say, it was enjoyable. Frustrating at times with connection issues but, for the most part, it was fun. 2 CoDs have been released since this one, though, so you may find that the playerbase is lacking. I live in Australia, and I had no troubles finding people to play with on 50ms ping, which is good considering the age of this game now (in terms of CoD's lifespan...). A good variety of weapons and maps and, again, the futuristic settings was a nice change to the semi-bland modern settings we've seen in the past. It isn't worth the $90 asking price it is now, so I'd say get it on sale (or somewhere cheaper...).    Zombies:    I have to say, I was a fan of the zombies mode that appeared in the original Black Ops, but unfortunately (mainly due to a lack in playerbase) the zombies mode in this game did nothing for me. I'm sure it would be a lot of fun with friends, but unfortunately because I got this 2 years after release, I had to go solo, which I found kinda lame... I did only play this for about an hour, so be sure to check out other reviews instead of relying on me!    Verdict:    - Fun game, especially with the variety of Singleplayer, Multiplayer and Zombies - The futuristic setting is a welcome change to the CoD formula - Unfortunately due to it's age (now), it's lacking in a Zombies playerbase, but it currently maintains a decent Multiplayer population  This over-the-top action first-person shooter is worth playing but I can't recommend it for it's price, so get it when it's on sale (if you're interested)!

While many of the complaitns are fair complaints, they aren't complaints with the game more so with the popularity of the game.   Pros: the game controls almost perfectly. One of the upsides of making the same game over and over is you learn how to do it well. Your character responds precisely and quickly. Also, the zombies mode is awesome. I hate calling it perfect, but really it's extremely good. I found myself buying the game AGAIN on the xBox 360 JUST so I could do split screen zombies with my friends. Standard mode is good, and grief is entertaining, but really tranzit is the real gem here. Basically you travel map to map in a bus and can get different guns and do different things at each map. However if the bus leaves and you aren't on it, you can get stuck at one map for 4-5 turns with nothing but the wall weapons (usually). It's tense when the bus leaves and you're stuck surviving round 15 with almost no amunition for your good gun, knowing that if you don't get full ammo you'll be stuck with a pea shooter.   Cons: well, here's what most of you wanted to read. Firstly the multiplayer shows little to no energy. I'm not talking about reused ideas, more that what's there is done slopply at best. The maps are bland and ofter have spots that can be exploited to wreck havok. While it's fun when you're the one doing it, nothing sucks more than to die to an unkillable sniper. The single player isn't so much a con as it just is not great. It is short and for the most part forgetable. It's really just a feature rather than the main point of the game. Something to show in the trailers. Sure it has cool moments, but the futuristic tech is almost always (unfortunatly) just used in quicktime events and what you're left with is your average Call of Duty.   In short, if you're a fan of the series, go ahead and buy it. It's a faithful entery in the series with enough new features to keep you entertained. If you're not a fan, don't get it, there's nothing really new to change your mind. To be honest, it doesn't matter what I say because 99% already have made up your minds. If you're a fanboy you'll get it and if you just want the series to burn you won't buy it. The quality of the game wouldn't change very many of your minds...",

After so long i hope steam/black ops 2 developers would've fixed this bug because it's a pain, maybe have an option to not compare you're story mode with friends? Apart from that it is a great game, great story, great multiplayer and great zombies! Buy it if you have under 60 friends or don't mind playing offline.",

There is a branching path singleplayer with the choises you make you change the outcome of the game. That also makes for good replayability. The caracters are very good fleshed out, Harper is a stereotypical sidekick/friend, oooh and Salazar, he is a very complex character where at the first playtrough at the Club on the floating city you may be confused when he refuses to shoot DeFalco saying he doesnt have a clear shot, but DeFalco and Karma are on the ♥♥♥♥ing dance floor....alone, bla bla bla SPOILERS. Raul Menendez is a very good villain, with a good backstory(which is present in the game and you play as him). The death of his sister is what makes him want revenge on Woods. Woods is in a wheelchair and hes old. There are the usual flashbacks that are typical for black ops. In those flashbacks you are presented with Menedezs backstory and his hate towards Woods and Mason. The multyplayer is the typical CoD arcade shooter with the choose 10 system. -Multiplayer: Hackers in multyplayer........ I dont know why activision abandones their games one year after....at least give the security job to valve ffs or at least a report option where if a player gets reported 20+ times gets banned, no more than one ban per player.....DO ♥♥♥♥ING SOMETHING. The progression system is great, i spent 10 hours in MP and im 31/55 lvl, ofc theres the PRESTIEGE for which i will update my review after i find out how it works, i think its hte same old same old.",

I guess I was so dissapointed in MW3 that I wasn't expecting much and I was truly blown away by what tryarch managed to pull of with such a heavily overused recipe and a recycled and outdated game engine. The singleplayer is very enjoyable and although being short it is packed with a tight plot that twists and turns leaving you thouroughly satisfied. Level disigne is well thought out and switches smoothly between narative walkthrough, infilteration and all out gun fights. The game is pretty replayable if you feel like seeing all the possible endings, somthing unique in the franchise I might add. The multiplayer is similar to that of BO1 in terms of game types but after that comes a hugh change for class personalisation. Your loadout can be modified to an extent never seen befor and lets you truly play the way you want. Challenges are better aimed (weapon addon challenges are no longer specific to the weapon they are on) and you can also customize your player card to an outstading extent. Also, anybody getting mad about this game and trolling forums clearly hasn't understood what one expects from a CoD game. As for BO2 it delivers all that makes a good blockbuster game... and more.",

Really got into this one.  As for Zombies, wasn't a fan before and I still ain't.  As for the MP portion, what a dissappointment. Spawns still aren't fixed and , unlike Black-Ops where you had 18 people who could play, now this has become MW2 and MW3. No server choices and only 12 people. I mean really?!? When I first played an on-line game in 1998 you could play with up to 24 and some games had up to 36. Maps are small and just OK and like I said earlier, spawns stink. Was really looking forward to MP since COD:BO had a nice Mp portion of the game.  They said they are gonna show CPU players some love with the next game, but I will have to wait and see. I that one fails, guess I won't be pre-ordering anymore COD.",

And they didnt failed us and I really think the mp's map is well designed. It's not battlefield but to be honest it's has a not bad multiplayer...( I guess what ruins the series is the mp in every year is just almost same really pisses so many people off )...  In Verdict: COD BO2 might be the best COD experience I have ever have after MW2, if you r new to the series, you can give this one a try, and if you r player who already hate this, you still can give it a check, cause COD ghosts out and you know how suck that game is..., but this one is the last COD we left, I guess......",

            "review_text": "Really good game. It is not very innovative compared to the previous COD games, but it is definitely a huge improvement over Modern Warfare 3 (the bonus campaign and map pack DLC for MW2). The campaign was actually fun to play!  Multiplayer is pretty much what you would expect, but the major differences are the pick-10 system, which allows you to pick almost anything for your loadout, as long as it doesn't count up more than 10 points, and the scorestreak system, which encourages you to focus more on teamwork and makes it harder to get the scorestreaks, therefore you won't have so many kiddies ruining your game by killing you with an über nuclear space bomber.   I am not really enjoying zombies, but there are people playing it and having fun out of it. Would be fun to play with friends though.  Do not listen to the COD-haters and Infinity Ward fanboys - if you like fast paced action combat, tons of customization, best balance out of all COD games, awesome maps and replayability - this game is for you. Save yourself and don't buy Ghosts.",

            "review_text": "Readers looking for an in-depth review of Black Ops II’s multiplayer, I’m sorry to disappoint. My knowledge in that area is minimal and as far as I’m concerned, nothing’s changed since the last iteration (save for some new weapons and maps). It’s still a fun and solid experience rivaled only by few others, but my true qualifications as a reviewer lie mainly in single player.  Despite Black Ops II’s static multiplayer component, the game still shows effort to break new ground through its ambitious campaign. As usual, the plot involves some conspiracy to incite global warfare, but this time, it’s one worth revisiting even after the credits have rolled. Since the first Black Ops, Treyarch (one of three Call of Duty developers alongside Infinity Ward and Sledgehammer Games) has shown a knack for storytelling. Their talents are still clearly visible here through their complex narrative cleverly woven together by events of the Cold War and Treyarch’s vision of the year 2025.  For the first time in Call of Duty history, the campaign offers branching storylines that are shaped by missions with multiple endings (determined by whether or not objectives were achieved) and choices made by the player. In the case of the later, decisions don’t boil down to choosing from a list, but are made with gameplay mechanics, be it interacting with the environment or choosing which limb to shoot. Often times, you’ll play through these moments without even realizing that alternate options existed and that’s what makes Black Ops II great - it encourages players to reconsider their actions. Ultimately, the secrets found and choices made will determine which of the five ways the game can end.  Also new is a tower defense-like mini game in which the player must direct troops against waves of enemies in bird’s-eye view. At any moment, the player may assume first person control of a friendly unit on the battlefield and play as normal. These missions, known as Strike Force missions, serve as supplements to the main story, unlocking themselves when certain conditions are met. They’re a welcomed addition and help immensely to vary the gameplay.  As proud as I am of Treyarch, especially for their contributions to the single player, there’s still plenty of room for improvement. In vehicle segments, handling feels extremely sluggish and the unrealistic physics breaks all immersion. The script is filled with clichés and the absurdity of some missions should have been toned down. Stages set in 2025 introduce several game-changing gadgets with promising potential that never reappear. But the biggest culprit of all is the fact that Black Ops II feels like a glorified game of Whack-a-Mole where enemies repeatedly pop out for you to shoot.  Multiplayer and single player aside, there’s still the topic of Zombie Mode. The new features here are a separate campaign and a new 8 player game type. While Treyarch’s efforts are appreciated, the final product is all but satisfying. The “campaign” merely consists of ordinary survival maps strung together by cutscenes and fighting zombies with an army makes an already dull experience even duller.  It’s refreshing to see a developer cater to the single player fans for a title with a track record for being predominantly multiplayer. In doing so, Treyarch has raised the bar for first person shooter narratives. Regardless of what comes from Infinity Ward next year, I can honestly say that I eagerly await Treyarch’s next release, knowing very well that they aren’t one to shy away from being different.  Grade: 4/5",

I want to be sitting here writing this review about how it is really satisfying, you can tweak FOV and it is the best in the series. Sadly, that can't happen.  Instead I am here to tell you that this game is unplayable for me. The mouse issues are unbearable. If I move my mouse from one point and back, it will almost always end up somewhere else from where I started. Sometimes it has positive acceleration and sometimes negative acceleration. Sometimes it likes to spin you 90 degrees in the middle of a firefight!  I have modified all the video settings over and over, tried all the fixes I can find but nothing helps. Even the 'Your mouse is too good, turn the settings/polling rate down' argument that worked for MW2 (Aggravating by itself.), does not apply here.  To top it off, they encrypted the settings file which used to be a text file, so I can't try and tweak that.  The issue is well known but likely no fix will ever come.",

The game still has dedicated servers and a very active player base (More active than Ghosts and AW). Though there are 2 major issues this game has and that is the lack of mod support. (Though if you want mods you can go buy CoD 4 or Black Ops 1). The second issue is that this game is also pretty expensive for being 2 and a half years old (Thanks Activision) but if you don't want to spend too much money you could buy the game on G.TWO.A or on K.i.n g.u.i.n.  10/10 Game though. And in my opinion CoD was better when you didn't have lasers all over the damn place and you didn't have kids jet packing all over the place.",

TL;DR, this game is greatly graphically optimized, can be fun for some time, but can be repetetive after some time. The community is gutter trash, but you can't expect much from competetive players trying to get under your skin to gain some edge.  After playing this game for so long and enjoying it, I really thought about what I was playing. And I don't reccomend it. This review goes for most COD games before MW3.  First of all, the community. Gutter trash. Need I say more? Let me go in detail. You play well, you are a tryhard/have no life You play badly, you are a noob You stay in cover tactically to avoid getting killed, and you are a camper and a 'fegit' You use a sniper rifle properly you are a 'hardscoping noob' Basically, you can't do anything without people complaining. If you are trying to find friends to play with, dont start from the game itself, get into a group or something. Hell, you have to be Indiana Jones to find a good person to play with in-game. Make one little slip-up and your whole team can be hurting your fillings.   The gameplay. Yeah, the graphics look nice. I'm impressed with the optimization for low-end computers. My bad lenovo laptop can run this game 60fps on medium textures, which is really good. It can be action packed at some points. But usually it's just repetetive. Shoot a guy. Run. Shoot the other guy. Run. And so on. Nobody even goes for the objectives in the objective gamemodes. If you're in combat training, (that's the only way you can really get into objective games since nobody really plays the standalone objective modes) don't think people are gonna be capturing any flags in CTF. Not much planting bombs in demolition, either. It can be fun at first, and incredibly satisfying when you can get in a lot of kills and few deaths. But in general, it can be boring. At points playing, you might just think to yourself ; Is this fun?  Graphics: The graphics are probably this game's strong suit. Greatly optimized.  Controls: Easy to get used to.   Singleplayer: Fun. Lots of choices for different endings. If you are getting an FPS for singleplayer, get BO2. For multiplayer, I would reccomend a title like battlefield.  With the regular modes, you can be put with people with totally different skill ranges than you. I believe league play puts you with people in your skill level, but I don't think anyone uses that anymore.  TL;DR, this game is greatly graphically optimized, can be fun for some time, but can be repetetive after some time. The community is gutter trash, but you can't expect much from competetive players trying to get under your skin to gain some edge.",

Orgins is probaly my 4th favorite map in all COD Zombies because the easter egg is ridiculously hard. My 3rd favorite map is Buried because it has the best camping spots if you have the right weopons like the Raygun Mark II and Paralyzer or a M126 Shotgun and a Galil. My 2nd favorite map is Der Riese because it is an original and its all together a very great map. My 1st favorite map is Mob of the Dead because of the easter egg and the Hell's Retriever and the Blundergat and the PaP Skin and Brutus and the Plane and training at the roof and running around the whole map training and me and my friend @colepark got to the round 34 which was hard but so fun.",

The only thing I have bad to say about this game is the price. I would never have bought it if I didn't get it on sale for $15. 60 bucks for 3 parts of the same game is a bit sad, and there are other great FPS's that are free, like Blacklgiht Retribution.

BUT - what really really ruins my good feeling is, that enemies are CONSTANTLY spawning right into your back and fight has absolutelly NO RULES (even in real war you know where is your safe zone/line/enemy territory) and i am killed constantly from behind! - mostly in 'NUKEJACKED' mode...footsteps sound of incoming enemy is in fact your only chance to know that danger is close, so you have to switch off other sounds and concentrate to this sound as much as possible - and all is it only about quick reflexes/flooding area in front of you with rain of bullets with no clue if it hits or not/and really helps to have top ALIENWARE gaming PC overclocked and having triple the FPS than other players have ;).   Another kinda stupid things are Lightning strikes and other mass-destruction ingame bonuses for best campers/biggest killers. With these things you are 10 times dying on spawn without any chance to save yourself...PLEASE - MAKE SOME SMALL SPAWN PROTECT - 2-3 second will be enough..your brain will have a chance to REACT(normal reaction time=2s)!.  All this is meant for multiplayer only - single player is really really OK and a possibility to choice, and make 6+1 secret (or so..) different endings is really sexy in this kind of game :).   Anyway - i still think it definatelly IS worth it - relaxing and fun factors are still great, graphics is really cool and smooth, prestige levels are rewarding more than ever in CoD series - you are loosing nothing but you are still motivated to play further.  Overall - very good job Treyarch - and see you on the battlefield pals :)   Sincerely yours   Samael ",

Lots of fun gamemodes, however, you will only find games in core tdm, s&amp;d, domination, demolition and hardpoint, hardcore tdm and s&amp;d and you will always find a game in the nukejacked playlist. The only bad things about this game on pc, in my opinion, is that you can't play offline like ps3 and xbox 360. Another thing is that the knife lunge is really far, which is annoying to play against but fun to use. I give this game 8.7/10.",

It was something different.  There was a map - it was actually a yacht. There were soldiers on the yacht. There were snipers shooting machinegunners on the yacht. There was chaos. The soldiers turned out to be cocaine addicts. Againts junkies. Or dealers. I was confused. It was quite fun to be hamster with a SMG.

The campaign is really good. It has intense moments, its emotional moments and its action crazy moments. It’s fun because the action changes and does not repeat over and over. The story sometimes talks about what happened in the past which was not explained in Black Ops 1, some games chapters revert to the past so you are playing in the past. This helps fill the gaps in Black Ops 1 and helps explain some new things in the current campaign. Multiplayer is also really fun. The guns seem to have a nice level of damage so the guns do seem fair. A lot of the maps are great and momentum changes based upon the map you are playing so again it does not repeat. NOTE: there are a few lobbies online that are modded. ZOMBIES!!! Even though I don’t particularly like one or two maps, they are all amazing. Each map has its own atmosphere that suits the map and its lighting. There are some great weapons and some new awesome perks to help you fend off the undead. Some of the buildables in the game are fun to use and helpful in surviving. Each map just as it did in Black Ops 1 features its own unique Easter Egg which continues the story from World at War. It’s fun figuring out the steps towards completion and finding out what happens next. But in doing so makes more questions and anticipation for the next map. In my opinion, Zombies is the best Call of Duty mode created so far and its intricate story like makes it that much better.",

Whatever though you can find 100s of reviews about how good the game is that are better than anything I could write and if you own this already you already know how good it is. what I'm going to talk about is a question I see a lot: should I still get this and do people still play?  First off should you buy this game: Hell yes BUT I'd either wait for a steam sale or find a cheap physical copy as it's full price is expensive for a 4 year old game. Also you will want to buy the seasons pass (all of the DLC maps in one package) or you will have trouble finding matches and will sometimes be put in DLC lobbies anyways only to be booted when people vote for a DLC map. If you haven't played a call of duty before I would still get this even though there are many amazing players it's a game that is fun even when you're bad and it's a fun experience to learn by fighting g players that can sometimes be 10x better than you. How else do you improve lol.  Now the other question: do people still play? Yes there can be from the minimum I've seen at low hours 1500 to 6000 on holidays and long weekends during peak hours. Don't be fooled by the low playercount that appears in the black ops 2 community hub, this game has 3 executables for multiplayer campaign and zombies and so 3 community hubs for each but the store page automatically takes you to the campaigns community Hub. Most of the time you can easily find games in: TDM, domination, demolition, search and destroy, hardpoint as well as a lobby called 'nukejacked' which is a rotation of all game modes on the maps NUKEtown and hiJACKED (hence the name) with more players than usual lobbies it's good for playing modes that aren't populated such as gun game, and for levelling up most weapons however if you get angry easily, are new to the game or want a more chill experience I'd avoid nukejacked. During off peak hours some gamemodes will be impossible to find however you can always find a match of TDM and nukejacked. Hardcore TDM and search and destroy have a good amount of players too if your into that.  I hope I've helped to answer some questions and to help people make an informed decision about whether they should buy this game or not. This game still holds up well today and is still 100x better than any COD game released after. There are many challenges to complete as well (like getting diamond camo) which give the game more to do than just running around shooting.  If you have other legitimate questions about this game drop a comment and I will be happy to answer to the best of my knowledge.  11/10 would never use jetpacks again...",

It has awesome story with Woods and Mason and than there is Mason's son and they all wanna kill Menendez. It has good graphic,good guns,i couldn t find anything wrong with singleplayer except it didn t last longer. I totally recommend this game to all gamers who like good story in game and love action and kinda stuff. And at the end i wanna to apologise if i did some mistakes at writeing this review i realy tried to wright it corectlly. :D",

It's ambitious - a big story with different endings according to how you play and what you do. But it's not really working. You know, this is one of those stories where the bad guy is *always* one giant step ahead, even able to turn around the tables when he's in chains under high security aboard an US fleet carrier. That's something you've come to expect in Batman movies, but here it is just too much. This at least partly explains why I liked the much more conventional story of 'CoD Ghosts' better - it also requires a fair amount of suspension of disbelief, but not THAT much.   Then I confess didn' quite like the 'strategy' missions (strike force missions). They tried something new here, I give them that, but it doesn't work too well in a shooter. At least not for me. Luckily, we only have to complete one of those, but then again we can't get the best ending if we don't successfully complete all of them.   Game hanged itself up a couple of times too, nothing too bad, but it shouldn't be.   It's a good game and I enjoyed it (and will come back), but sometimes less is more.",

Almost everyone in PC who plays Black ops 2 will receive an error, making you not play the game. I don't recommend this game no more. So please keep you're $60 bucks with you thank you.  UPDATE : 12/22/16 This review used to be a thumbs down, but I change my mind and rate this game a thumbs up! Seems like they fixed the windows 10 thing where it crashes when you start it.
