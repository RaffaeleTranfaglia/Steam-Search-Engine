            "review_text": "Mortal online can be a great game if you sarround yourself with the right ppl. This game is a true sandbox mmo which is very hard to comeby now a days with a skill system similar to the elderscrolls series. I personally have had a blast with my guild through the highs and lows that this game can bring.   To adress some of the negative comments i have been reading here are some tips to get the most out of mortal.  1. Get out of the starting cities Morin khur and tindrem as fast as possible. This is where you will find the most thieves and the most griefers who come there to take advantage of your inexperience. Avoid toxai as well since there is a well known guild that gets off at killing newbies there.  2. You are going to die and lose stuff at some point. This can be frustrating but it is a pvp full loot game so become smart about banking stuff you dont need to carry around.  3. This game is meant to be played with a guild. You will have a really hard time without guidance and help from vets in the guilds. This isnt like any other mmo where you can just look up a guide from newbie to vet and be fine. A good place to look for guilds is the mortal online forums guild recruitment section where guilds display their playstyle and tell you a little bit about themselves. Join a helpful guild as soon as possible but do your homework on what kind of an outfit you are getting yourselves into.  Most of all have fun with the group you play with. In any game its the quality people that i laugh in teamspeak with that keep me coming back. Good luck ingame",

            "review_text": "When I saw free to play that kind of deterred me but I'm really glad I tried it.  If you liked Ultima Online before the facet split - this might be for you. :)  -People can murder you at any time and take everything you have on you  -They can steal your things (from your inventory)  -They can make armor out of your skin   To a lot of people that might be frustrating and at times it can be but at other times it turns such occurances into epic tales of survival and triumph when you live through an attack despite overwhelming odds or recovering your belongings from your corpse before other people get their greedy mits on them.  Plus points:  -Very interesting crafting system with no (very few) fixed item recipes  -Taming, magic, archery, mount breeding, the works  -Incredible degree of freedom with according penalties (you can eat leather but dont complain if it gives you problems :P)  -Interesting weight system if you work out a lot like running or fighting or whatever and only eat ♥♥♥♥♥♥ food with low sustenance values you will waste away to a skinny twig (with penalties to your strength etc) - the opposite is also true if you only eat fatty food all the time and rarely move because you stay in town all the time crafting you will get fat ^^  -Be what you want to be, a thief, a feared murderer, trader, crafter, adventurer, tamer you name it  This game is not for you if you like:  -brainafk farming in the same spot without any awareness of your surroundings (you WILL die if you don't stay vigilant)  -keeping everything on your character or at least way more things than you are prepared to lose  -the idea that people can pickpocket you and steal stuff from your inventory  -questing sprees or any type of themepark-like game experience - you make your own adventure    If you give this a go never keep anything on you you're not prepared to lose - even in town.  A lot of the negative comments mention Blueblocking which is annoying but this mainly happens in the starting town and the graveyard but this once again comes down to situational awareness, always keep track of your surroundings if people lurk around you behaving suspiciously without actually doing something themselves they ARE probably out to get you in some way or another. Keep enough distance from others so that if you swing your weapon they wont have enough time to run in front of your swing and generally don't swing your weapon around like a madman especially in the graveyard where lots of players are in a small space trying to get the spawning mobs. Or leave town altogether and try to find your luck there where blueblocking is generally not an issue (but player killers are more prevalent so watch out)  Long story short I love this game so far it is strongly influenced by ultima online and the degree of freedom is fairly unparalleled. And while that of course opens the door to thieves and spawn killers and other things like that, it also enables you to have a very rewarding experience if you can weather the storm. I enjoy the rush of knowing that training a skill outside of town or gathering things or whatever can turn into a fierce battle at any time - the risk is what makes things that happen in this game memorable, death has an impact. Also beheading someone who killed you before and then making soup from their head or feeding it to your dog is incredibly satisfying :P  TLDR; Very rewarding experience if you don't let deaths and loss of items get to you. It is a hostile environment but that just increases the impact random acts of kindness have when a stranger passing by saves your life or hands you a suit of armor because you seem to have lost it all. (Dont beg for things it's unbecoming and everybody hates it ^^)  Strongly recommended but don't say I didn't warn you ;)  Cheers Wes",

            "review_text": "I found this game on twitch and was hooked before i knew it was on steam. i had a 6 month sub before i downloaded it. Then to find out its a small team of Delvs that has done all this its kind of mind blowing. 4-5 guys built this vs 100s of ppl on other games just to make landscape.  This game reminds me of world of warcraft 2003. before it was nerfed into the ground.   A. It has one of the largest crafting systems i have seen in a game.   B. The combat is unlike other mmo's and can take a few days or weeks to really learn how to fight (like CSGO vs other FPS you have to learn how to use the weapon).  C. You can write books. make ingame maps/armor/weapon's/poitons. breed horses or other mounts to use to sell and so much more.  D. Its a mix between Eve/Elderscrolls/WoW/ and medieval warfar.  It does have some bugs and node lines but hey i dont fall past the ground and get stuck for 2hrs like wow 2003. when the game lets out a patch it does not forget to add something i need for a month like BC. i have not seen all black mob without any color just a shape like Naxx at 60.  Hands down one of the best games i have found in a very long time. only thing i see holding it back it the player base both in greefing new players(something you have to get past then its not a big thing) and in the money a larger player base would bring so the Delv team could hire more ppl and roll out updates.  Explore/be a highway man and rob ppl/ build huge keeps and citys/ Find something that no other player has found share it or keep it secret its up to you, this game has so many sides of play it even has fishing you pick bait,line,hooks, how deep you cast it.  If you enjoy a harder style of game with a amazing crafting system and are stick of all the pathed games being made anymore then this is for you. its a world not a 16man Q or sitting in town waiting for a Q to pop for you.  Oh and the game has heart it just ban a full guild AiM for cheating thats why you see so many angry posts about the game. Game &gt; $$ thank you very much Delvs.",

            "review_text": "  This is going to be long so get comfy,  This game is the best game that ive ever played in my life, and im not joking. Before i discovered mortal online, I was searcheing for an open World, free to play midevil time based game, I had no luck for about 3months of searching. then my friend told me about mortal online. I instantly fell i n love with it. Its everything I was looking for. Open world Massivley Multiplayer open World Full loot PvP and etc. You can pratiucally do whatever you wan't in the game. When I tell people about mortal I normally tell them 'It's like Skyrim, but 10more content, no quests and WAY more fun, oh... and all multilplayer.' You can do so much in this game and its really astonishing. But the fact that it came out in 2010 doesnt phase me, it just makes me sad that until not, the community is just stating to grow, and getting more recognishion. I feel like this game has so much potential that it will become the 'best selling game of 2016'. And im not joking. I love this game so much that I used to play about 6hrs every day, and me being me, not wanting to pay a dime, created not one, not two, but three Free-2-Play accounts, and for those of you that dont understand what a big deal that is, well, you can only log into one F2P account a day. But since I have 3computers its fine. If I were a new player looking for some information on how to get started in game, i'd say making a footfighter/mage first or a hybrid. That is definately the most fun way to play as a F2P. Now back to the praising, If your descision on buying a game is based on reading reviews, then get this, If you look at the reviews that have been written, just notice, just notice the amount of time they have played the game, almost everyone that has written a review on this game has probably played over 300 hrs! And if you look at the ones that are positive to be exact, some (like me) Has played over 1000hrs!!! Now why would someone play a game that sucks for 1000hrs ?? Ask yourself that question.  THIS GAME IS A MUST DOWNLOAD!  My IGN's so far are: XYT Ultric Gatorade",

I have 290.2 hrs played on this game and none of them were spent AFK. When I was playign this game it had a very populated server and wasn't so corrupt as it is now I do hope one day to re download this game again to find everything in working order, but until that day I remain inactive.The crafting system is difficult and intricate and require a lot of time and/or good social interaction you do not want to try to do it all yourself unless you ahve massive amounts of time. The monsters in the game are fairly unique and I will probably not find anythign like them for awile. ~As a female I thuroughly enjolyed this game that is dominated by the male population.~ ~Constant death IS A THING in here so don't get pissy people~",

It might be unforgiving at times but I come back every time to play regardless of my in game loses. World is huge and you can immerse yourself in it.

            "review_text": "Mortal Online will have momments where you smile a smile of peer joy, just to have that smile wiped of your face by a random player who saw you heading towards town. They will attack you and probably kill you for no reason other than to see what loot you had or just to prove their better then someone new to the game i guess.  While the Game itself has one of the best concepts and a decent excution of a full loot sandbox many players will find it to frustrating to really enjoy. The community is aweful, the worst i have ever experienced in any game i have ever played. Just look at the forumns and youll get an idea of what im talking about. Thats not to say everyone playing mortal is aweful, but 60%of players will kill you just to kill you and 85% will kill you if they think it will get them good loot.   I have come to enjoy the game over all for the momments when that player that attacked you bit of more then they can chew or when you stumble on a robbery in progress just in time to turn the battle into a win for the innocent. This game isnt for everyone. Heck, its not going to be for most but few hardcore games are.  PROS *Combat system is both fun and 'skill' really can help. *Every interaction with a player is exciting. *Player driven economy/world *Really cool and refreshing skills gaining mechanic( you have to use it to get better) *Havent done much crafting myself but there is really awesome depth to it. CONS *Full loot means a death can set you back hours.. *The Community is aweful *There are still exploits *Blue blocking ( This is when a player jumps infront of your attack so you hit them, now they can kill you with out being a murder.)  Overall This game is fun but its def not for everyone but its free to try and if you like it Sub because your not gonna make it if you dont.",

After giving it a few days on a free account I have to recommend the game to anyone who likes the basic game mechanics of a zombie survival game; that you can kill or be killed almost anywhere and the 'story' is up to you to make up. If you like to be kept mainly on rails and given quests you will not like the game, but if you like to just wander off and do what ever you want you will have a blast.  It is not however perfect, there is some lag in places (if you can cache the game in the options window), there are PKers everywhere and there is NO hand holding. Other than a very basic tutorial on how to move, tame, kill, and craft a robe you are on your own. I would suggest to anyone starting out that you read some basic guides on game mechanics so you have a better starting grasp of the game. Other than that there is not much more to tell from how little I have played, I will edit if anything changes or comes up.",

Right now at the time of this review the community is overwhelmed with questions on how to get into the game and I gotta give props to those trying to help the fellow players out.   At first I thought the Tutorial was woefully inadequate but again through exploring the world I was taught more about the game little by little rather than having to digest everything in one big dump of knowledge which lead me to wanting to explore even more giving me the idea that starting out I'm nothing more than peasant material and need to get out there and do something if I want to puzzle out what makes a simple character into their goal.

I could die at any time to a player who comes along. But I won't lose much and if I get this load of valuable wood back I will have a stock of some of the best wood in the game for crafting.  Crafting is really intricate. A lot to figure out. So far it seems worth the challenge.  My pvp experiances so far have been limited as I'm in the gearing up phase. I've been killed a few times and assisted in a couple of kills. A lot of potential for fun in a combat system much like Mount and Blade - a truly awesome game.  If you start a new character you must choose Tindrem as your starting city not Morin Khur which is held by the main pk (playr killer) clan who have locked the gate. If you do find yourslef there suicide and ghost walk to Tindrem - their is an online map that can help you on this epic journey.  I still have a lot to learn but so far I'd give the game an 8/10.

The game is sandbox, and it tries to be as realistic as possible, including that there will be hunger, no starting maps, no global banks(town banks doesn't connect with other town's banks), stealing, securities, housing, etc etc etc.  Combat is pretty much skyrim, you have your stamina, you adjust your distance at your enemy, you strike with either swinging or thrusting, and of course they will have durabilities, you can parry and block, and there are also magics, and Full looting system. There is no level system in this game, so you have full skill points and attribute points ready to be allocated by doing stuffs(reading skill books, activities that corresponds said skill, etc). Skill points are limited, there are 2 types of skill, primary and secondary, primary spends skill points, secondary spends none. You can hit people in towns and even killing them, but hitting innocents will cause you to be a criminal and be chased by op guards capable of 360 noscoping you with magics and arrows  --EDIT-- After putting in few more dozens of hour into the game, i want to add something new here, the game suffers from crashing issues, and it doesn't tolerate disconnection, you got disconnected? your characters will have to wait either 10 or 40 seconds before logging out following you, will the same thing happen if you crashed? well... yeah.  Anyways, my experience with the game has been both good and bad, i found new way to make money, got excited, got to live in a man made guild base, seeing my tamed mounts sell, killing and finding new monsters, realizing that the monster's loot is a fortune to sell, etc. being a f2p dude, i decided to make my character a hybrid to spend those unused skill points, i decided to become a hybrid fighter and a tamer, and it worked well, i might not fight as good as my other guild mates, but i still had fun coordinating with my good teammates.  The starting town(mainly Tindrem) is but a one's place to suffer and grow before finally deciding to venture outside for an adventure, as i've said before, this game got no map, but they gave you compass, a working one, you should hone your pathfinding and exploration skill, or you could roleplay as a hireable bodyguard, there are people actually people looking for an escort from one town to the other.  --EDIT-- Pros and Cons  ---Pros---  -Multiple ways to gain currency, tamer(selling pets), crafter(Selling eqs), Extractors(Selling extracted / advanced resources), PK-ers (Spoils of w-, player killing). Thief(stealing stuffs) -Combat is not typical. -Great crafting system. -Broad selection of creatures to be tamed. -Broad skills and career selections. -Open world, vast areas to be explored. -Guilds. -etc. ---Cons--- -Not newbie friendly(Punishing deaths, blueblocking, returning alive is a bit troublesome, Sandbox Confusions, etc), most newbies decided to stop playing this game after experiencing that the game is too punishing and confusing for them. -Stucks, jumping to some location might result on you getting stuck forever. -Cooldown on /stuck, a command which helps stuck players. -f2p limitations, the max points to be allocated on one skill for f2p players are 60, subscriptions players have no limitations -f2p tamers can't tame dem' cool minotaurs ;_; -f2p players can't steal. -crashes.",

The veterans in this game seem to not have much to do so they've decided to kill their time by making life for new players as difficult as possible.  Other than that, the combat is clunky, it's like Chivalry with none of the polish, mobs can hit you whilst they are facing away from you, animations and movement look very awkward as well, blocking controls are rigid... Generally the combat revolves around 'parrying' (blocking just before the mob attacks absorbing most of the damage and allowing you to unleash a counter attack) after 10 minutes you are able to easily predict their strike patterns/timings and the combat just becomes a bore.   Graphics are bad, mostly because of really awful looking textures and the game is very buggy too, it feels like an Early Access and it is 5 years old already. There's a DX11 option for example but it's so unstable it's pretty much unplayable (Constant CTDs, lag etc). DX9 mode is a lot better in that regard but there's still many in-game related bugs that plague the game. Optimization is poor, even with a very good system I cannot run this game at full settings.  Community is annoying (other than griefers), no criticism towards the game is accepted (fanboys), any criticism will be met with 'Go back to WoW', 'Carebear' et cetera.   The game is often described as hardcore but honestly it doesn't take much thought or skill (in fact it takes almost none), the only thing 'hardcore' thing about the game is the constant hurdling you'll get from griefers/PKers and how much of your time will be wasted because of it, it's just a timesink/grind really. Either way, if you like those kind of games and can overlook many flaws and rough edges, you might like it, I play it and do get some enjoyment out of it but I'm not foolish about what this game is and isn't as well.  If you're looking at this game you probably already have some interest in these type of games so for that reason I'll recommend to try it given that it has an unlimited trial.",

In order for your character to do something, you as a player must perform an action with sufficient skill. No tab-targeting or anything of the sort. Just you, your knowledge of the game and your skills as a player.  2) It's a role-playing game. Even if you don't like RPGs, Mortal Online has a way of naturally leading you to assume a role. It could be the role of a fledgling player afraid of the seasoned murderers, or the role of the avenger who musters friends and acquaintances to deal with said murderers, or maybe even the role of the thief snooping around other people's pockets and coming up with plans to break into their homes and rob them of their hard-earned currency. From the moment that you start playing, you will also be role-playing, possibly without even realizing it.  3) It's a strategy game. While one well trained person can be a formidable opponent, the combined force of many men who have developed not only their personal fighting skills, but also a common way of conducting themselves during a battle, can be game-changing. Strength lies in numbers. Those who know this and use it to their advantage may very well become the next rulers of the land.  4) This game is about choice. You have an amazing level of freedom regarding your playstyle. You may want to become the best warrior Nave has seen. In that case, one option would be to work on your fighting skills, then work on building up a stock of quality armor and weapons, and finally join a guild renowned for its combat prowess in order to become even better at what you do. On the other hand, you may want to live in the wilderness by yourself, hunting game and exploring the vast expanses of this rich world. If that is the case, you could start by learning how to tame animals and to cook basic dishes, then riding your horse into the unknown until you find the right spot and decide to call it your home.  The game does have its drawbacks. You may feel that certain gear or attribute combinations are too powerful in certain conditions. You may feel that there are a few bugs too many. You may also feel that customer support isn't the fastest around. But you must also consider that this incredibly complex game has been hand-crafted by just a few individuals working in an indie company. You must realize that these devs are constantly browsing the game's forums, sifting through players' feedback and trying to tweak every little detail so that it can work completely as intended.  Having played this game for more than two and a half years, I'm confident that it can be a huge success, should enough people give it a chance. This will also allow the devs to continue with their planned new features and their ongoing mission to polish the player experience as much as possible.  If you value the freedom of making your own choices about every single thing in a game world, then Mortal Online is your ultimate playground. Give it a try and you won't regret it.",

Used mostly to gain popularity, most people don't really understand what true freedom is in a sandbox game. Mortal Online is one of the few examples of what a Sandbox is suppose to be.  -The Entire Economy is player based. Everything in the game, is run by the players, from the crafting of armor, to the price of cotton, the player determines everything. It is a rare concept in a video game, as, if players so chose, they could easily ruin the entire game economy, but Mortal Online throws caution to the wind and allows players to run the entire economy alone. This has been an amazing feature in the game, and has developed entire proffessions and guilds in the game, dedicated to selling and crafting items to keep the economy solid. There is even a player owned bank in the game that manages players money in return for them being able to use that money on 'Credit'.  -Towns are local. Be scared, if you go to Tindrem, the games largest town, and wish to trasnsport your items to another town...you are dead out of luck with the mailbox. The mailbox/postman only sends the mail to other players inside the SAME town. This is a unique feature as it forces players who wish to trade to actively grab the items they want to trade, and transport them to the town of their choice.  -Full Loot...Yes, that's right, the entire game is open world, hardcore, PvP with full loot. That transporter bring items from Tindrem to the next town is fair game to kill and take everything he owns...however, all of your gear and items/hardwork are also at stake.  Unique Game Features: -Housing -Fishing -Pet Taming -Mounted Combat -Full Loot -Free Placement Housing -Keeps -City Building -Largest Crafting System in any game to date -Friendly Community (After you dig past the handful of true scum) -Realism -Religion -Player Driven Economy -90% of in-game items are player crafted -First Person Warfare  Cons (Yeah, I'm not all gung ho for the game):  -Bugs...Not even game breaking bugs, just silly things every once in a while. Nothing that crashes my game/pc...but floating plants every once in a while... -Agressive PvP (Players will openly hunt down weaker players for fun) -Long Term Community Memory (The community will remember the bad actions you took for years to come) -Lacking City Protection (Guards will do a ♥♥♥♥ poor job of protecting you, hire/ask players to assist/protect you) -Sudden Skill Curves (PvP and high tier PvE require advanced teamwork and large amounts of game knowledge, compared to other game features that simply require you have common sense.) -Griefing...The game has serious griefing issues, and, although it is a small ammount of the community that does indeed grief (around .2%), it is very noticible as they stalk around the starter cities and are relentless in their tactics.  All and all, it is a wonderful game, however, the cons are very restrictive to the player base.",

            "review_text": "I once had a quest to find me an mmorpg that I would keep playing.  Now I don't have any quests at all and I love it!  I started playing Mortal years ago and it still hasn't lost any of it's feeling. You can even make a break and when you start again, you only realise you've been gone a while because the territory map doesn't show any familiar guild names anymore.  What I especially love about this game: * The broad possibilities of character configuration.  I have a fighter, a cook, a tamer/breeder, a fatmage (my favourite :3), my friend has a butcher, an armor crafter, a dexmage (that's a fast footed mage while the fat mage can't really move without a horse under his feet) and then there are a few experimental characters, too, where we try different skillsets, weapon specializations * The thin spezializations.  You have 1100 skillpoints with means you can max 11 primary skills to 100.  11 sounds like a lot at first. But a fighter for example needs like 3 primaries in movement, 2 in defensive skills, another 3 in offensive skills, every weapon type is a primary, riding is a primary, armor training so you can wear heavier armor, mounted combat is a primary and handling weapons on a horse as well. The skills include primaries and secondaries. You can have as many secondaries as you like but to get to most of them, you need a primary. Like you can know anything you want about weasels, horses, molvas, rabbits, wisents, camals, and all the endless different kinds of mammals there are, you need to invest points into mammalia first. * The diversity of the world. There is jungle, desert, snowy mountains. And the creatures are endless, from cute little rabbits to monstrous minotaurs! You can find very different materials, different woods, metals, minerals, flowers. There even is honey :D * The payment system. Free-to-play chars have a skill maximum of 60 instead of 100. Man, they can't do anything right, you might think. Yeah, somehow. Fighting in Mortal is heavily player-skill based. If you can't hit the enemy right, it doesn't matter what fat armor you have or how high your weapon skill is. You still lose! F2P-Fighter even have an advantage: They can max 1100/60=18,3 primaries!   Uhh, let's... move on...  What I don't like about Mortal: * Bugs, bugs everywhere!  Everywhere you go, everywhere you look, there are these little things that just aren't right. Flying plants, items vanishing from your inventory, getting stuck, pet movement (Letting your pet follow you along player made structures can lead to spontanous death to lil ol' pony T-T (okay, it wasn't the structures but the aggressive mobs behind the walls my pony felt running into) ) I got used to most of the bugs. I know which ways to avoid or how I can make my items appear again or on which spots I shouldn't kill mobs because the lootbag spawns underground. * The very, VERY big bugs! There was/is this bug, where the client crashes when I get hit on a horse. No fun with my fatmage! Hasn't occured when I left the new continent Sarducaa. Don't know if the bug still exists but I don't dare going there anymore.  * The very thin possibilities for f2p. F2P crafter are useless. Completely useless. If you don't pay, you have to fight. * A certain uncomfortable part of the community. The ones complaining about every little change and about how overpowered a certain weapon is, which is not true most of the time, or that this or that race is useless, which isn't true either or that there are cheater or star vault prefers a certain guild or bla bla blaaah. And the ones saying 'we don't want new players' camping in the starting cities ruining every new players start.  A lot of text. But, please, one final thing.  What others might not like: * You can lose everything. Full pvp, free loot. You leave the safety of the guards in town: you have to expect being killed and robbed. Say goodbye to your horsie. Bye to your new sparkling armor set. Bye to the 100 gold you wanted to transport to another town because banks are not linked and the only postal service you have is you. Or hiring another player. Which I maybe wouldn't do because... trust noone!  But i can ensure you: Making a save delivery under this circumstances is even more rewarding! Everthing you do successfully makes you happy as hell. * No questies. Nothing to do?! I, myself, back in the days when I first started MO, I found it hard to set myself goals to reach, to find things to do.  Today I don't think I'm really over this, but when I don't know what to do, I don't just quit the game anymore but say 'Eh, could kill some more megnatons' and with this jouney new unforseen adventures begin :)",

The game is beautiful, and I believe well thought out. It is player driven. This is PVP everywhere. No place is safe. You are accountable for your actions within the game too.  There is much to learn in MO. This game is hard! You have to explore and figure out for yourself how you want your character to be. Which is not easy as there are so many choices. Note: One character can NOT be all things. You have to decide what best suits you. Not an easy task.  There are problems, it does have glitches. But nothing that game stopping to me. The GM's are friendly and helpful and have had no problems with long ques waiting for help. I find it refreshing to play a game that does not bore me with in a short time. Most games do cause they are just too easy.  When you fight, you have to aim. No just clicking a button and the game taking over. You must be sure the foe is in your range and sight. Learn how to handle the weapon, fighting stance, parry, blocking, etc.. Again, this game is difficult.   If you are looking for an easy game. This is not for you.   If you are looking for a challenge. Want to explore. Want to feel like every little goal is a great accomplishment when you succeed, then this is the game for you.

This game is filled with nothing but griefers that will pray on new players making sure they wont leave their starting cities by killing them and taking their stuff. I had to keep on starting from scratch and back up to where I was just to be killed by a vet on horses who armor are almost indestructible and whose weapons can cut right through your armor and kill you with one blow. Even 2 AI guards has a hard time killing them and the guards are powerful. Thats how strong these players are. They even camp the graveyards in the cities where noobs go to make money.  Also other players will keep on killing your horse/donkey, the ones you bought with your gold that takes you a couple of days to make, just for the heck of it anywhere even infront of guards just to watch you rant. Most vets in this game are murderers which are worst than criminals. They prey on noobs and gets a kick out of killing them while they're trying to learn the game. They do this because they know they have years and years exp in this game before it came out on steam. You will barely get to explore the world alive because they are also patrolling the lands outside the city to track and kill you. The only way to explore the lands is as a ghost. Be warn, when you revive at a priest, there will be a vet with their name in bold red letters which signals they are murders and they will kill you. Do not download this game because this game is made to support griefers. Im ending my subscription and hanging this game up. I was so excited to see a game like this but once you exp it, you will be let down. Nothing but bad community and too many criminal RP. Today was my last day. What did it was, I bought a horse which cost 4 gold and 50 silver. Went to go buy equipment for it. Had a large bag equiped on my horse so I can carry items to trade. Bought a 1000 food for the horse which cost 1 gold for the journey. I put on my armor and equiped myself with my shield and weapon. got on the horse and was ready to explore. Soon as I stepped out the city gates i made it 100 yards away from the gate. All the sudden POW get hit by a powerful mace and my guy feel off the horse and died. Then I watched my horse fall from one blow.   A screen popped up with the murderer name saying report murderer. For what? He is already red and enjoys killing! So far I died more than 30 times in within 16.6 hrs from blue blockers, murderers, and criminals. I lost 4 donkeys and 2 horses from criminals. 10 of those deaths was me trying to leave the city and 2 of those 10 deaths was from me reviving at a priest in a town i traveled to as a ghost just to die from a murderer patrolling the town buildings. For those that dont know what blueblockers are, they are players jumping infront of you while you are swinging your weapon to kill a animal or the dead just for you to accidentally hit them so you can turn grey which grants everybody to kill you and take all your stuff because your now a criminal. Until this game is fixed and im done. Good luck to anybody who decides to download this game.",

My Steam showed 0 hrs but the game have non-Steam client that I have used for years. So, I trust that you can over-look my 0 game time hours and not see this malicious, libel, but an honest review.  This game compromise too many time. When server population are down, GM and owner of Star Vault make patchs to cater to the old members. when server population are up, they reverse and make patch for newer people. It is always a bottom line for them to bring revenues. They can't please everyone but can't upset their last remaining people.  Lately, the rule about blocking off major content, like the town of Morin Khur, in the game have been flush down the toliet. The rule is there but not enforce in much to disappoint the remaining players.  The game economy operates around butchering and macroing extraction or fishing. Over the year, they banned fishing macro, but the damage for macro is not contained. People who have made their money, kept it. The rule about botting and macro are hilarious because there aren't much different between botting and macroing but they add their opinion just to not upset their old players that will max train their character in 5 days in macroing. Most people who sold lowest price on metal are likely those who macro extraction. In a way, Mortal Online is Macro/Bot Online. You either macro or butcher, extract, and fight in the game.  People have argued for siege mechanic and tempt everyone to siege them. But, in a way, you are sieging their macro fueled asset. In some case, Morin Khur, a blue town like other major game content where the rule about blocking content of the game will get ignored.  So, you play Mortal Online, you can play however you like to play it but understand how much compromise the company will bend to let abusers bend their way of mastering Mortal Online. The future of Mortal Online have been altered by blocking content and doing massive siege which again paid for by macro economy.  Abusers are the richest people in the game. Don't ever forget that! This game need to be re-name as Macro Online where computer program of bot or Star Vault's viewpoint 'macro' are playing the game for the player. And, I can understand that macro is allowed and that using it isn't abuse. But, you still abuse the fair gameplay aspect of gaming. In a way, you let steroid change your body to outperform those who work hard.   A well known player who I don't name have 10 accounts. All assigned to macroing. In a way, Star Vault see this as 'revenue' and doesn't interfere with judging on the Ai's level of Macro to make sure it isn't a bot. Star Vault had rule about not having VM running in the game. What kind of computer that run 10 accounts would be able to run macro task efficiently and precisely?  Update:  They decided at the last minute to make boundaries around Morin Khur and Toxaii unbuildable. Although, the change was needed. It came late. It was common sense for any business with online MMORG company to not let player destroy the sandbox fundamental core of the game.",

I came into the game knowing if you die with things on you, you will likely never see those things again and I was fine with that. Then I found out after playing a couple hours that a single hit from a player will kill you and that was the end of that for me. This game is not skill based in the slightest simply because of that reason and it kills the fun. Hey just spent hours farming a certain area and are now overloaded so going to drop some things in your inventory and head back? Dead, without even knowing how. Going to look inside your bank to get some things out? Dead, oh but the guards killed your killer so don't mind that you lose everything on you still.  Archery gameplay is horrible, they tried to add in arrow drop to make it more 'realistic' my arrow can fly a foot before it will hit the ground not to mention it doesn't even come out where the aim marker is. Taming is a really cool idea, your pets die the moment you get them so now thats gone. The world looks like ♥♥♥♥, people can say all they want 'games don't need good graphics' but hell ya mmorpg really really really do. It's not enjoyable when half of your play time is spend wandering around twiddling your thumbs looking at ♥♥♥♥ untill you get to the destination.

Reading and following the instructions scratches at a surface that promises fascinating depths, but penetrating the UI to find the specific thing you're looking for is an exercise in frustration.   Learning new skills requires your character reading a book... the very first book I got had an 18 hour timer, and the act of standing there, watching that timer tick down improved my skill in 'reading' and after half an hour brought it down to fifteen hours. Whoop-dee-doo.   I'm never one to rail on a game's graphics, for their own sake. But as dated as this game looks, it should at least boast a more stable frame rate. Instead, I had to tone the options down, and get used to the idea that 'playable' would have to suffice.

No skill caps, house creation, etc,.  It doesn't seem like much, but for a first person sandbox mmo, to declare itself as free2play, it should have all features unlocked, with some features limited in what they do.  Example - House creation should be unlocked for EVERYONE. HOWEVER, you can't be allowed to put up banners or paintings, or make fireplaces. AND you should also have a limit on how big your house can be and the materials used in it.  As it stands right now, they want you to pay to try out a feature, which you really shouldn't have to do if its saying free2play, if something big(and for a sandbox mmo, housing is a BIG feature cause it adds immersion.)

Save yourself the time and effort to commit to this game. Let me give you a long story short... There isn't anything community related in game, EVER. The game itself is ran by egotistical veteran players with hankerings to ruin the game for new players and ruin the game as a whole (yet they think its just part of the game). The devs also do their own part in ruining the game by never promoting community events, get togethers, or boss events.. This is the epitome of a great game gone all the wrong ways. Let me blow your mind though, THE DEVELOPERS FIRED THE COMMUNITY MOD BECAUSE HE WAS HAVING FUN WITH ALL THE OTHERS HAVING FUN; 'He wasn't taking his job serious enough.' ... and that was the last thread of hope this game had. Don't forget PvP will never be fair, you will be zerged, the beginner zone is the only place where you'll see players. Everywhere else is a barren wasteland of nothing and they'll never focus on player experience. Final thoughts: This game has potential to be the greatest mmofps sandbox ever, but sadly it will never be because the community and devs have united to ruin it.",

            "review_text": "After finding this offer online for free and giving it a shot for a straight run of seven hours I can summarize that this MMORP is a compromise. The game elements are easily identifieble and like any other MMORPG this one is 'pay to win' with the free accounts serving as a permanant trial, being unable to progress into a situation where your character has any chance against: guilded players marauding the countryside, lone horsemen murdurers, pick pockets, 'low level' griefers, fatigue free hostile animals and many more, I find it difficult to find the positive in a 'full loot' environment where 4+ hours of grinding can be erased with a stroke of another player's hand (or a mouse click rather)  The combat system is clunky. The animations are delayed on both attacking and defending making the victor 'he who has a lower ping' combined with 'he who has managed to attain a powerful weapon'. Stamina is easily depleted and forces the player to stop and stand in place, or submit to a static animation (sleep or sit) and 'ranking' it up requires well thrice more investment in time spent training one specific skill. (or multiple skills) and similar goes for the majority of the other 'skills' that I've learned about. Certain portion of the 'skill tree' seem redundant- for example, the multiple different kinds of anatomy studies acquired when skinning different animals, or the variation of wood type lore which all feel like a weighted shackle on the road to adventure.  This MMO failed to deliver me with a unique immersion and like other similar (LIFYO for example) it funnels down to a grinding game, which completely beats the notion of Role Playing to me and leaves me questioning the purpose of an anarchy situation. Are they hoping that the players create the story? And if so, how could they if they are always busy killing each other? - With guilds involved I was speculating this might be the answer but to my disappointment the guild scene is a closed clique party with most guild towns being locked under passowrd or a sassy toll.  If you are expecting an immersive story where you might create your character and bring it into a story based adventure, this is not your stop. - If you are, however, just looking for a grinding &amp; power building game, this is it!  As far as the technicalities go; The game world is detailed compared to other MMOs i've seen recently. It is however not as large as I've hoped it would be. (in 7 hours i've explored most of the main continent) The tutorial which grants you some basic items and skill knowledge is very to the point and fluid making it easy for everyone to understand. The time divisiion is quite fair, with night time not being too dark and day time not being too bright and the over-all scenery is very nice with how the moon is possibly the planet and the game world being the moon in this setup (speculation only).   In short, I feel that this game focuses too much on statistics, attirbutes and other red tape rather than the immersion of adventure and discovery which is why I feel it's less RPG and more MMO and I would not recommend it at this point of writing.",

It's a scammy way to run your business, you don't really get to keep what you pay for. But if you don't mind supporting dev's who keep supporting these pay models, then by all means perpetuate the problem. There is one other thing that made me wary of this game is that the experienced players will literally tell you not to talk about bans, or the banning of your friend or really anything to do with banning, because if you do you will get banned yourself.

            "review_text": "I previously gave this game a positive review just to draw in new blood from Steam, but heres the truth.  1. There is nothing to do. PvE is a Joke, NPC's are completely boinked. To counter this they gave them the ability to knock you down and render you unable to defend yourself for a few seconds. Unless of course you drop 100 points into a skill that has no use to you besides defending against those knockdowns.  2. Obtaining gear is a huge grind. You need 3 characters to support 1 combat character of your own. Characters that a new player doesn't even know how to build without help from others or extensive research through the forums.  3. Gathering the resources needed to make those characters is mindblowingly tedious for a new player. You will be killed on site by the majority of other players who will also kill your mount(required for gathering) and delete your haul because they themselves probably can't carry it.  4. Min/Max builds, nearly everyone aside from roleplayers are the exact same race/skill build. This varies from month to month as they change aspects of how skills affect things like damage bonus and combat speed. So If you want to stay truely competitive prepare to reroll that character you spent hundreds of gold &amp; hours on every couple of months.  5. Two vastly empty continents, aside from the rediculousness that is Terrority Control. Ride across a wasteland of randomly placed AI that yield nothing of value to you, unless of course you dedicated an entire character to butchering their carcass. Wow look at that huge palisade a player has built, lets see if they are inside, nope! No incentive to login for these players at this point, they are gathering safely while offline thanks to Territory Control.  6. How is your ping? 100, no that will never do. Connect through your phone's wifi or start some torrent downloads as some packetloss and 400 ping will serve you better(Yes people really do this). Watch as your opponent seemingly stands in place attempting to hit you, while you run circles about him with your polesword dispatching him and his friends.  7. Broken weapons, better be packing a polesword(reinging champ) or flanged mace or you are about to get your ♥♥♥♥ pushed in.  8. In-Game staff &amp; forum moderation. These 'helpful' fellows are pulled directly from the sesspool that is the Mortal Online community itself. Be careful who you decide to interact with, because chances are they have a friend in high places.  9. Henrik, the CEO. For years we have pleaded with this guy. The entire community is up in arms about the above listed issues, yet he acts on none of them. He is either blind deaf or dumb. Maybe all three.  Thank god for steam, otherwise this would have been another deleted post in the MO forums.",

            "review_text": "First Impression: Fun game, great concept, no levels, allows players to be super powerful by how much time they put into it, but; there are some downsides.   First of all its F2P so players who pay obviously get the advantage. Also the combat system is a little wacky, and the tutorial is little to none. The world is vast and amazing, but only players who pay are allowed to explore it, since F2P players cant even get strong enough to kill the things outside the castle. Overall the game was a fun experience, i LOVE the concept of no levels and being able to get as strong as you want to be, but i just dont think the game is worth the subscription price. If you made the game pay once, and no subscription, and fixed the combat bugs and added more divercity and better terrain design, then it would be a game worth buying.  I do not recomment this game because it is a waste of time, unless you are willing to spend the money on it.",
