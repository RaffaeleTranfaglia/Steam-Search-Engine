            "review_text": "Reviews over this game seem to be split between those who hate it and those who love it. I am now part of the latter group, albeit it did take a bit of getting used to. Pretty much everything the negative crew mentioned is true, I just find it is not as bad as they make it out to be. On the other hand the game is a LOT of fun to play. If you are coming from playing HoI like I did you need to get used to that there is very limited historical accuracy in this game. If you want Austria to join Germany you have to attack them. Alliances take weird turns in this 'anything goes' game. And the game engine is a bit quick in starting rebellions. The first time I tried the game, by '38 not only had the UK lost most of her colonies (not that I minded playing Germany) the UK itself had fallen appart into: UK, England, Wales, Scotland and Fascist UK... I think the turn based gameplay makes it more playable than HoI, as does the fact that there are far fewer provinces to keep track of.  The way the game is set up you can also play historically minor countries and turn them into world powers. If you are looking for historic accuracy, stick with HoI. But if you want a fun game where anything goes, give this one a try. It is the end of 1938. After completing a mega-industrialization in Germany I attacked and annexed Austria, Czechoslovakia, Danzig and Poland Japan had requested to join my alliance after I took Austria. While fighting Poland first France and allies (Netherlands, and some others). And then the UK and allies (including US and Canada and a few more) declared war on me. While I punch through the Maginot line in a titanic battle against numerous but ill equipped French forces the UK alliance declares war on the French alliance as well as on the USSR - I liked it already! France sues for peace offering me to keep the two maginot line provinces as part of the deal. I accept. Next round I offer them and the Soviets to join me. They both agree. Meanwhile Italy (the third most powerful nation on earth) refuses as they do not wish to get involved in my war against the UK. Hungary also refuses for the same reason. I secure full military access through France and the Netherlands (and now help protect their airspace with my fighters while I bomb London; and I offer partial military access to the Soviets (opening my ports to them) 1939 promises to be interesting as I frantically try to build up my navy and an invasion force to take the war to the Brits... Literally anything goes in this game. And that alone makes it more than worth while.  ",

            "review_text": "I must say that this game is near and dear to my heart. It's certainly no Hearts of Iron or Civilization, but it's certainly not a bad game either. If you enjoy turn based strategy and would like a simple 'conquer the world' type game, this is definitely worthy of your consideration.  Having played the original game in the series and playing this one since pre-order beta in 2010, I can say that it definitely has a simplistic appeal to it. Build unit in a city, send it into battle, take the world. This is essentially the board game Axis and Allies with the computer doing all the work for you. It bridges the gap between Civilization and much more intense grand-strategy games like those by Paradox Interactive. It also runs on lower-end PCs which is a plus, althought be warned that at turn 1000+ (1950s) the time between turns will increase significantly.  A few positives: -Simplest grand strategy game that covers WWII -The game is easy to learn within an hour of playtime -Research is straightforward -Almost no game is historically correct, the AI decides when and if it wants to go to war. Some sort of WWII will always happen, however  A few cons: -Not the smartest AI -Trade system experiences weird fluctuations late-game -Long time in between turns starting in the late 1940s -Combat is entirely based off total combat power and the terrain modifier  Overall a great game for those looking for a simple grand strategy game set in WWII",

The first game, everything was simple and you could figure it out on your own... this game is death by a thousand cuts because of the extreme amoung of mircomanaging and unclear ways of how to do things. DO NOT BUY unless you have a LOT of time on your hands because that is what you will need to learn the insane Learning Curve.",
