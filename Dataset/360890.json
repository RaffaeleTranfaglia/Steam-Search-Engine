Well, I thought we all knew that going in.  There is so much already placed in here that the devs will open up to us, even crates which will surely be loot for us since there would be no other reason for them to be there. I just went exploring and found much to enjoy. Besides items, and things like turtles and frogs, blue dragonflies and flocks of birds, theres buildings and a water tower, a tree house with a broken latter which I'm looking forward to climbing up into. There is more stuff besides. I glitched my way past an invisible barrier and fell off the top of a mountain. I thought I was going to die, there was blood, but I didn't, and found some stuff! Well, I had a very good time. I'm going to love it farther along in the development, and the music is beautiful. When I fell off the mountain I never could find a way out so I had to exit the game. For five bucks why not buy it. Help the developer out to bring this game along. It will be worth it, to me anyway. Hopefully they will never...EVER....put a zombie or monster in here. I'd like to have at least ONE game to just enjoy :)",

Im not a developer or plan on making any games with Cryengine, so Im not sure what the point is.",

The music is a little distracting from the environment, and doesn't really help the game in any way. The animations for the wildlife were also very choppy. I rate it 4/10 because the game's graphics are fantastic.",

Yet people still buy it and complain about it being a walking simulator with little to no content.  This game is ~20 minutes long, it is a very beautiful game, as is with almost all games that use the Cry Engine. The music is quite good and relaxing. The things in the game are beautiful, nice to look at. A good game to play for 20-30 minutes with a cup of coffee, preferably when you're already in a relaxed mood.  A distasteful thing I noticed; The shadow of your character looks like some creepy alien dude, a little off putting. And the options menu is irritating.",
