            "review_text": "  W4MM - Looking to play! Want to chase me around an art gallery with dogs and alarms? (London)    You:    A bunch of chunky goons; 6ft+ only    Must be radiating a translucent cone from your eyes to indicate your field of vision   Men in uniform with random patrol paths    Me:   A lithe, classy redhead in a hat (you'll know me when I drop the hat and run when you spot me)   Into toys :) and I will bring them (glue, cat noise makers, teleporters; that's how I like it)   The stealthiest fun you will ever have!   ;) Catch me while you can, boys!  If you're into pure stealth experiences The Marvellous Miss Take certainly knows how to please. I myself am often found crouched in the shadows, stuffing things into my pockets, being the creep that I am. And, as such, I can tell you what makes a great stealth game. An adequate stealth game gives you steady feedback on how visible you are at any given time and makes it clear how alert your opponents are. A good stealth game is all about cunning movement, where actively removing threats is impossible or undesirable. A great stealth game takes all of the above, adds a heap of character, and then does something you've never quite seen before. Miss Take is a great stealth game.  Like spitting into the hair of a tall guy a couple rows in front of you in a dark and crowded movie theater, The Marvelous Miss Take is a pure stealth experience. You cannot incapacitate guards and your goal is to get the loot and get out without being caught. If you get caught, you lose.   However, where Miss Take really shines is in its focus on getting into and fleeing from danger. You could take your time on every level and get through the game easily. But if you want to get through well, you'll have to beat the par times for each level. This might sound awful to old stealth hats, but the game doesn't punish you for being seen as long you can get away. And as anyone who has run naked down a public street of a major city knows, that has some veracity (provided you have no obvious tattoos or weird scars). In fact, being seen is a great way to get the guards to stop patrolling near the loot and come stomping to where you decided to give them a show (as most fellows will). At least this is how it plays for two of the characters.  What!? Multiple characters and playstyles? Take a minute to collect your popped monocle, reader. Yes, Miss Take has three characters that play quite differently. With the eponymous Miss Take you have to collect all the paintings in each level and you are usually given some sort of tool to help: smoke bombs to hide, noise makers to distract guards, a teleporter to move quickly to where you throw it, etc. However, if somebody notices you and you run for it, she'll drop her hat, which you have to get back before you exit, making drastic evasion riskier. Her extra goals are to beat a par time and collect loot behind display cases you have to smash (alerting anyone nearby).   Your first ally is a more traditional thief, who can't run but has no par time to beat. Your optional goal is to take your time and not be seen. His inclusion was especially nice, since that's the sort of trimming-a-bonzai-tree, patient experience I play stealth games for and lets aficionados of the genre feel like they can ease out of their comfort zone.   And finally, the third is a teenage pick-pocket who has to get up close to a guard, stay there for long enough to snatch a key and then unlock a safe that will set off a blaring alarm. She has no tools, but she doesn't drop her hat when she springs into action like a kangaroo wearing moon shoes. Once again, the goal is to do it quick (certainly not what she said).  This plays out over 25 levels, which you will go through once for each character with minor changes for each one. Much like the interiors of our protagonists' purses, it's an impressive amount of content. And the difficulty most certainly rises to meet your mounting skills (oh my!), with later levels adding threats like security cameras, dogs that will pick up your scent, and lasers that will limit your movement. Add these to the basic threat of guards with random movement patterns, and you have yourself a challenge, sir.   Fortunately, the game also gives you tools to deal with the rising chaos. Miss Take's tools are obvious, but each character can make a sound to draw guards to the area; controlling their movement for a time (and without breaking the stealth bonus for our traditional thief). This is essential, since while random patrols provide a pleasant risk, it would be terrible if you had to wait for them to move into or out of the ideal position for half an hour while the RNG has declared the order of the day is back and forth like the ping pong savants' international tournament for obsessive compulsives.  And if this extensive love letter to Miss Take isn't enough, the aesthetic of the game is perfectly fitting a game about art and the acquisition thereof. The soundtrack is stellar, with a good selection of lovely hard bop jazz. The models are fairly simple, but the animation is good looking and lively and the use of bright colors make sure Miss Take looks timeless rather than basic. The characterization of our heroes is strong and - despite their seemingly misanthropic profession - they're made quite likable, like a bunch of posh Robin Hoods, in comparison to the completely deplorable villain. The game isn't terribly verbose (unlike me), but the dialogue that is there is often witty and enjoyable.  Miss Take does have her worts, they're just small and mostly out of sight (like behind the knee or something). Despite the quantity of levels and the small efforts to make differences between them for each of the characters, the setting for every level is the same style of art gallery. Only the layout and time of day changes. Graphics options are pretty solid, but it gets a little funny about the resolution when alt+tabbing out of the game. You can't fine tune the volume controls or rebind keys. I found using pure mouse control to be less than smooth, but using the keyboard to walk fixed that (the 360 controller also works). And the glue tool has some problems. For some reason glued enemies would stay alert and constantly aware of my position until the glue ended, causing some problems. But really, if Miss Take were a painting, the stain of these would only amount to a single drop of coffee from the spit-take at how otherwise amazing it is.   So, yeah, The Marvelous Miss Take is easily the best stealth game I have played in some time. Worth twenty dollars? Maybe, if you just need your skulking in shadows fix. I'd probably recommend waiting until it goes on sale for ten bucks. But absolutely get it then. If stealth is your thing, you won't be disappointed. If stealth isn't your thing? Well, Miss Take won't go out of her way to court you, but if you meet her halfway, she might provide you a chance to get into it (ba-zing).  One Last Note:  I read a couple comments to effect that some people were put off of this game by Feminist Frequency's endorsement of it. I won't jump to any conclusions about those that might feel wary about that. Frankly, if a group that is about a social/political agenda, even one I was involved with, was pushing a game, I'd probably be concerned that I'd just have to sit through a parade of their memes rather than a game I enjoy. Don't worry about that. The Marvelous Miss Take will appeal to feminists for obvious reasons (and good for Miss Take for hitting that demographic), but it isn't a feminist game. It's a stealth game. A really, really good stealth game. A great stealth game.",

            "review_text": "The Marvellous Miss Take has the allure of a great Caper Story set in London, where you play as the beautiful Sophia Take, a thief reclaiming her aunt's art collection. You stealthfully try to take back your aunt's masterpieces from a number of galleries utilizing quick strategy, an array of high-tech gadgets and the special skills of your fellow bandits, Harry and Daisy. Each level provides a range of challenging security from guard dogs, to lasers, and infrared cameras, requiring masterful forethought in planning your heist. Each character has a number of achievements to unlock based on specific art pieces collected or how fast you finish the level. When it comes to trying to beat the clock, it can be frustrating at times because the random path of the guards almost seem like they know where you are, leaving you no choice but to run and hide or start again.  Part of the fun with this game comes from figuring out the fastest way to loot an area without drawing too much attention. While you can scroll around a level to a limited diameter from your character, having a separate free ranging camera to look over each gallery before you loot the place, is remarkably absent. Sure you can see the entire layout of each building before you start the mission; however the angle is skewed and somewhat difficult to see all the key areas. Like a real heist, we should be able to scan each floor and note where each treasure piece and security is located in order to plan our course of action as efficiently as possible.    The story of 'Miss Take' is enhanced with jazzy music, stylish animation and a colorful palette. The narration is bookmarked with humorous newspaper headlines about your antics and simple text boxes spoken between your characters and patrons. Given the setting, it would have been great to hear these characters actually speak with an English accent. It would have literally breathed some personality into these characters and brought the game to life.  Gameplay itself is deceptively simple, using point-and-click mouse controls to run, walk, distract and throw objects. Crouching is done automatically when you sneak behind tables and pillars. There is an option to use Keyboard controls but there is no indication of what those keys are, and no way to rebind them. The latest update added an Action Camera function, the (C) key, to zoom-in on your character during gameplay. Unfortunately this is nothing more than a close-up still frame for screen capturing; you cannot play while in this view. While the official trailer shows clips of Sophia walking around at this lower camera angle, it's bewildering why this new feature locks the game as it would have added a whole new dimension and replay value.   Despite some of these minor qualms, The Marvellous Miss Take is a refreshingly fun and unique ‘take’ on the stealth action genre. You’ll spend hours sneaking your way through a minefield of puzzling obstacles, reclaim your aunt’s “stolen” masterpieces, and do it all over again just to beat your previous time.",

            "review_text": "I r8 it gr8/8 m80s. Love the art direction and sound design, and the gameplay is pretty solid so far from what I've seen. I haven't had a chance to play as the other two thieves yet, but I imagine they are great too. The guard AI is fairly reactive along with being both random and predictable. They'll go wherever they want with no pre-set path, but there are ways you can distract them to certain areas (whistling, walking into their line of sight for a second, etc).  The core gameplay is you are a thief who wants to steal things, and so you do. The levels let you know how long you take, so you can always go back to a level and try to beat it faster.  Overall, it's a very fun and holistic game that accomplishes what it sets out to do very well.   Also I'm writing this at 2:30 AM with a headache, so if it's a terribly written review that's most likely why.",

            "review_text": "I really enjoyed my time with this game. The top down stealth style works quite well as you can get a nice look at the layout of each level and the randomized movements of the guards make you react on the fly instead of just memorizing their movement patterns and exploiting those. This leads to some moments where you will lead to some moments where you get completely screwed over but adds more tense moments to the game as you pray that guard doesn't turn around and see you. With most levels having a 'par time' to beat, this makes some of your encounters intense as you need to race around and avoid detection instead of just sitting around too much.   The level variety is good and having 3 different characters to choose from with different talents keeps the game from getting too stale. I was not overly thrilled with the enemy/obstacle variety (there are really only 4 kinds all game: guards, dogs, lasers, and security cameras) but the devs do a good job of mixing and matching those combinations in levels to keep you guessing.   It's the stealth game you probably missed but should definitely try.",

It's a very challenging stealth game, since the guards and dogs' routes are random, so unpredictable things may happen, and you can't just sit by and wait like in most stealth games or you'll be caught. It also has cameras and lasers on top of that, making it even more challenging. You get to play with 2 additional characters after unlocking them and each one adds something new to the gameplay: with Harry you can't run, but you can distract the guards; and with Daisy you can pickpocket the guards to unlock safes for additional stealing, she's also the fastest of all 3 characters.",
