            "review_text": "Puzzle Agent 2 is a game marred by plot inconsistencies and an unsatisfying story. While the characters and atmosphere pull the player in, the gameplay and story problems are overwhelming.  After competing Puzzle Agent 1, I was excited to play the sequel. Unfortunately, this game doesn't hold up. The story has suffered, as the overloaded plot crashes and burns in a chaotic confusion, leaving plothole debris everywhere. A list of which includes:     Agent Tethers keeps his job at the FBI despite returning to a case without authorization; breaking and entering into the local police department; tampering with government evidence; assaulting another government agent; espousing conspiracy theories to his superior; and stealing and destroying government property.   Mrs. Garrett did not want someone to know that Tethers was staying at her inn, but we never find out who or why.   It is never revealed what happened to all the missing people in Scoggins, because...   It is never established whether the astronauts are murdering the missing people or if this was another wild goose chase. Since there have been a few false leads in both games, intentional to the plot, there is no way to know.    This leads to another problem for the story: If the astronauts aren't murdering people, what's causing the disappearances? If the astronauts  are  murdering people, why didn't they murder Tethers when they cornered him and injected him with something to make him fall asleep?   It is never revealed what happened to the astronauts aside from Isaac.   Why did the astronauts remain in the forest for 16 years?   What are the Hidden People? Where was their home? What was their home?   Why did Glori and Isaac agree to go the Brotherhood if he was disturbed, when he never appeared to be disturbed?   Did the government know the space lander was in Scoggins since the first game? If they did, then why did they wait until Tethers sent back tapes in the second game to go there? If they didn't, why didn't they let Tethers finish the case is Scoggins the first time around? Why did they let Tethers stay in Scoggins after they found out he was there investigating a case off-duty?   This is a minor point, but Agent Tethers never draws his gun once in this game, even when his life is in danger. In the last game, I believe he uses it only once, and he misses. For some reason, the game's title card on Steam shows him drawing a gun. Again, I know this is a minor point, but why give him a gun if he never uses it? Especially since it's so easy to write in a reason he doesn't use one; He's an office agent in the Puzzle Research Division who almost never goes on field missions. There's even less of a reason for him to have a gun this time since he's not even on offical busniess. It just shows a lack of thought in the writing.      The list goes on. This is totally unacceptable and unprofessional story-writing. You can beat the game in under 2 hours (I've played the game a couple times to get all the achievements) and the number of plot-holes is unbelieveable. Why else would a game so short have a plot explanation on Wikipedia that's as long as a PhD dissertation?  I've heard great things about Telltale's more recent work, but there's still no excuse because Puzzle Agent 1 was satisfying as far as story goes. Yes, there were loose ends and mysteries at the conclusion, but the main goals were achieved and the mysteries were largely related to things out of Tether's control the whole time: He couldn't understand this odd little town, and he never would. It was over his head, and he caught a glimpse of something greater than he could ever imagine. The player is left intrigued. In Puzzle Agent 2, parts of the mystery are revealed and simply make no sense, leaving the player very frustrated.  The biggest problem with the first game were that the puzzles were inconsistent in difficulty and clarity. Here, it seems the difficulty has been smoothed out a bit, but they have lost variety and at times still have difficult to interpret rules. The biggest problem I had was that the puzzles had little to do with the story and actually broke the pace.  Not to say I disliked everything. Sheriff Bahg was my favorite antagonist from the first game, and his condescending skepticism of the meek FBI man Tethers is always so well-played. The voice acting for Bahg is excellent. The atmosphere in the game also retains it's X-files allure, and Tethers searching for clues is still exciting. Korka was an interesting new character, and she gave the story some funny payoff and comedy relief. I always liked Tethers as a character; he's an excellent straightman in a world full of insane people. He also always has this idiotic confused look on his face that's actually pretty endearing.  ACHIEVEMENTS: Since this is a point-and-click adventure game, this is pretty hard to screw up, but Telltale pulled it off. One achievement requires a perfect run of all puzzles in the game. Even if you beat the game with one failed attempt at one puzzle and go back to that puzzle after the conclusion of the story, it doesn't matter. You have to open a new file and play the entire game over and do everything perfectly. Kind of a waste of time.  Overall, the game is atmospheric, exciting and well-acted, but the gameplay and story problems are too great for these high points to overcome. Not recommended unless heavily discounted, you have played the prequel, and are looking for achievements.",

            "review_text": "When the first  Puzzle Agent  released, it was an unexpected but welcome change from developer  Telltale Games 's typical point-and-click adventure game that they are know for. Given it's cliffhanger ending and complete lack of closure it was inevitable that a sequel would eventually emerge, and thus we are presented with  Puzzle Agent 2 , a direct continuation of Nelson Tether's previous escapades in the odd little town of Scoggins and a fitting end to the story that was begun in the last game.  Although it's marketed as a full sequel, PA2 is far more akin to a second episode, which is fairly typical of  Telltale . It ties directly into the ending of the original game, tying up loose ends and finally shedding a light on what happened to Issac Davidson, what have Nelson's visions been about, and who the heck are the hidden people. While many of the revelations are absolutely absurd taken in context with the rest the series they don't feel at all out of place, instead just one more bizarre happening in the day to day occurrences of a puzzle agent. I was very pleased to finally get some answers for the many questions that had previously been asked, and in the end everything tied up quite nicely (or as nicely as anything this unusual could).  Gameplay is identical to the original game, mixing Professor Layton-like puzzles with the Twin Peaks-esq setting and dialog to great effect. The puzzles are a bit fewer in number this time, but as a whole they are better designed and effectively tied into the story than before. Many characters return, with better writing and voice acting while still retaining the original off-kilter charm that made them what they are. I never did adjust to the stilted animation style, but like everything else has a unique appeal to it that works with the rest of the game.  If I had any problem with the game it's that it's short, shorter than it's predecessor, and yet costs twice the price. I couldn't say that the quality of either of the two games is far apart (I think both are excellent for what they are), but at double the cost of admission with less content, it's hard for me to recommend purchasing PA2 at least outright, and would definitely advise waiting for a sale.  Other than the length,  Puzzle Agent 2  is a treat for fans of the original. You're getting more of the same, and that's a good thing as so far there isn't anything else like the series available on Steam. Playing the first game should definitely be considered a prerequisite, and if you didn't like it then this won't change your mind. For those wanting for more this is a worthy sequel who's biggest flaw is actually being called one. Think of it instead as  Puzzle Agent: Part 2  and you're unlikely to come away disappointed.",

What comes next?' was used at least 4 separate times, even more if you include the times when it was reskinned with coins or something similar. Do you know how many    days of are in each month of the year, when added all together one by one    ? How about    reconizing binary when the counting units are coins    ?

There wasn't a single unique puzzle in this entire game, even unique to itself. All of the puzzles in this game have been done to death, were used at least once in the previous game, and repeated at least once in this game.  I was disappointed with the first Puzzle Agent game, due to the poorly written and downright difficult to understand puzzle decriptions at times, but at least it tried to be unique. It felt like a challenge. This on the other hand, well, I hope you can spin squares around to match them up.  And as a separate issue, on the last puzzle I had a glitch where the main items of focus didn't even render. They were black squares. Through the final puzzles, through the very end of the credits, I had no idea what the items of interest were. Even the after-credits scene didn't load properly. I hadn't had that problem with either of the games up until that point.  So I got to shlep through 5 puzzles with different skins for four hours without even a final feeling of completion.   Rad.",
