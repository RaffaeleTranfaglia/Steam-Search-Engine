            "review_text": "One of the better recent VR games Ive played. Visuals work surprisingly well in VR. Think Minecraft but without the blury ghosting effect and better aliasing. Controls and gameplay are responsive and easy, but game still requires skill. Where you aim is where you hit, which is what you should expect, but its something to be said because many Vive shooters cant seem to get this down. Its also very cheap for just $3, at the very least try it if you like VR shooters.  FYI. Im running 1.5 render target multiplier on GTX 980, and game runs fine with no lag or hitching.",
