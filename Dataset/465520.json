You should try this game despite liking riddles, or not. These are generally short here and even if a little chaotic worth figuring out on your own. Art is gorgeous aswell as animation. There was a lot of effort in such small experience. One exception is repetive music.  Story well... I wished it was longer! Since I was already getting something from character development. *BAM IT ENDS*. You know especially when there are things staying on the back of mind unexplained. Game is mysterious and doesnt let go of that feeling, even after end. Next time I hope for a bigger project in same idea of puzzle-horror-adventure. Since they know how to make atmosphere. I would be glad to pay for something more than just 2 levels.",

Awkward clue combinations that make no sense. Clicking on every possible item to get a reaction. Unobvious clickable areas (looking at you 3 drawer dresser). Missing cutscenes (codec issues? -- fixed by developer, as noted in comments). And the game ends, then you click Start to continue it. That's just confusing and needless.  I would have really enjoyed this game, if I didn't spend all my time switching back and forth between playing and the discussion thread.  But, by all means... It's free, go for it. But be ready to be annoyed.  Sidenotes: I didn't realize there were achievements, I didn't even notice the popup. Easy 100% Definitely buying the OST",

The courser changes when you hover over something you can click on. The little girl singing made me angry and the game wasn't really scary in my opinion.  I don't know if it is good for an point and click game since I usually don't play this type of game. The changing courser makes the game easy enough without giving you the answers and it has some acheivements but not cards. So if a point and click horror game that is not the scariest sounds like something for you then try it, it is free anyways so why not try it. Have fun, enjoy and clean the rooms :)",

Quite frankly it could've gotten away with crappy music and art considering the price (badum tsh) but the fact that those aspects are so polished is just the icing on top. Price is a point and click adventure game, with some of the same problems of the old point and click adventure games including lots of clicking on everything and trying to use every object you collected on everything else. But it's still a simple game with a pretty good horror story to go with it. No jump scares, just that sort of creeping dread you find in a nightmare. Personally I much prefer that type of more psychological horror to begin with. And it's free. Come on, I would've paid MONEY for this game and you can play it free so go do it.",

Infact, I know why.[/b]  The original translations of the game actually have more cutscenes than our english translation version on steam, which actually adds quite the story and explains a lot as well.  It's quite a problem for those who want to actually understand the story better, as that our current english version looks like a cheese with holes.   On and all, I just hope people who made this game actually notices this issue, and I hope that it'll be fixed soon. For the sake of the enjoyment of the english players.   ",

I was really impressed how well done the graphics and the cutscences were, especially because this game is for free.  With only an hour or two of gameplay, this game is really short but it knows how to tell a good and closed story with the right amount of mystery and a little bit of creppiness.  The puzzles were fine as well, not that easy and not too difficult, so you can enjoy the story without checking a guide every second ;).  Furthermore, I really like the flow of the story, how the mystery is building and how the character learns the truth bit for bit. This small adventure has also a sad (and a little bit creppy) but beautiful soundtrack, I loved how perfect it matched with the atmosphere and the storyline. So if you like a little puzzle-game with a creppy but moreover really great presented story (the visuals are more than fantastic), give it a shot, you definitely won't regret it.   Hope to see more games like this from the developers, and I wouldn't mind to pay for this quality :).",
