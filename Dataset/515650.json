Will write a more detailed one later on.  This game is great if you like roguelites. I bought it because I loved the art but it's also very fun. I'm pretty sure whoever made this game was high on several different drugs but it just adds to the charm. It's pretty basic in some senses, 90% of rooms are just enter and kill everything, but the combat is fun so that's ok. The items have been pretty damn varied so far. Unlocked a couple characters and they all have their own distinct playstyle. Definitely worth the price if you like roguelites and great pixel art!",

            "review_text": "This game is really good.   The controls are tight. The music is great. The graphics are simple, but done really well.  My only complaint is that the game is a bit too easy, but maybe there are modifiers that I haven't unlocked yet to increase the difficulty.  It's well worth the price.  EDIT: I unlocked another character and it made the game much harder. Complaint revoked.",

            "review_text": "This game is so wonderfully ♥♥♥♥ing weird and has some of the tastiest pixel art on Steam. The gameplay is pretty fun too, but that's almost secondary to the weirdness and art.   I would normally write a more extensive review, but what more do you really need? It's an amazingly weird and amusing roguelite Metroidvania that sort of plays a little like Section Z on the NES. Really, the less we tell you before you go in, the more wondrous the weirdness will be. Oh, and it's good and charming weird, not creepy weird. If you don't want the game after reading that, you have brought shame to your family for having poor taste.  If enough people discover this gem, it's going to be a roguelite classic together with Binding of Isaac and Risk of Rain. It really is that awesome. Go now. Do it. Do it.  Do it.",
