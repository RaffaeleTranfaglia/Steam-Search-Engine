You just play through the story line and that is it. Maybe I'm being too picky but def. try to get this game when it goes on sale, don't feel like I quite got $20 worth. It's fun to play games like this when you do it in real life!!",

However, I was expecting more than this game provided. I finished the game in 3 hours. A game priced at $15 should provide more play time, missions, freeplay for this, at least a little bit better graphics, better game overall, and longer to beat. With 3 hours of game time, and it being $15 without discount or bundle, it would have been $5 an hour, that is horrible. I do not recommend getting this game, unless it is at an extreme discount or in a bundle.",
