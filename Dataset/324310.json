Ah yes, Bus Simulator 16; never played the other 15 though.  ALERT: STORY SPOILER AHEAD!  The Game starts off with a nice little Tutorial; A guy named Ben (bad choice DEVs -&gt; made me think of Spider Man -&gt; instant cry), who sold you his Bus Company to retire and spend more Time with his old Lady (a Bus i guess), greets you and together you take a small tour through the City of...yeah, through the City.  The Immersion instantly kicks in, a nice Cockpit to call your own, Buttons to push, Engines to start, Doors to open (for a summerly Experience, let the Front Door open) and so on.   Minutes later you will have your first Passengers; They seem like a nice Bunch although female Students are dressed like hookers, dunno why. Havent encountered any Pimps yet.  Its impossible to rip-off your Passengers throughout the Ticket-buyin-Process; which saddens me a lot.  Approaching a Station is pretty easy, you just need to 'kneel' before your Passengers, open the Doors, engage the Breaks, and the same in Reverse if you leave the Station. The 'Action' Cam helps a lot here (awesome Feature btw, made me feel like Don Johnson in Miami Vice *deal with it*)  After 5 or 6 Stops and returning to your Garage the Tutorial ends, and the real Fun begins:  You have to plan Routes, drive them and fulfill different Objectives to progress through the Game.   A little later you´re able to hire Drivers (pretty random at their Personality; even had a PhD Dude who wanted to become a Bus Driver, lol)  There are quite a few Options there for Customizing your Bus: Decals, ADS, Colours;  Sadly no Options for the Interior (would love some tiger carpets or Dragon Skulls in my Bus).  Graphics-wise i must say: 30 FPS never felt so fast (caution: irony!) The Details are OK, like in every Simulator-Game i´ve played by now. Not bad, not very good, somethin in between; The  Busses look very nice though;   What i really missed is a Season Pass and the Opportunity to kidnap all your Passengers (or at least be a Getaway Driver -&gt; maybe some cross-over with the Payday Universe?!). Maybe i am fortunate and Still Alive Studios are going to release a DLC?!   All in all i enjoy riding my Bus (i look so manly in the rear-mirror doing so) throughout an unknown City, goin on a Rampage here and then, not stopping at Stations (we can't stop here this is bat country) and after starting a new Company (the third by now) i can say: Thankfully the Citizens do not recognize People very well!",

That is THE TRAFFIC. It's rubbish, slow, thick, annoying and generally bores tha pants off me. You spend more time crawling along the road behind them or you are stuck at never changing traffic light where nothing is moving. It doesn't make you late but sitting looking at a computer game that is doing NOTHING is annoying. If they don't change the traffic signals and traffic movement it will bore me off the game. Would I recomend it - YES if you like sitting around doing nothing and NO - if you want to drive.",

Expectedly, BS2k16 doesn't catch stars for you, surprising with subpar performance (come on, 15FPS even on GTX750Ti? With THESE visuals?) and sudden crashes out of nowhere... Okay. It crashed on me only twice but I had to resolve it with playing in windowed mode. Not the editor's choice, if you ask me. Handling will feel familiar for those who had to sit through SCS Soft's Bus Driver back then. Except there's no penalty for slamming the brakes (unless you engage handbrake of any kind) and MAN A23 has stopping distance on par with supercars. Seems like it's a simulator not in regards of vehicle behavior but rather of what a bus can do and what a bus ride can be, with pneumatic suspension 'kneeling' for these self-entitled meatbags on bus stops, with doors jamming on a freshly bought bus, lights, cashier, opening doors and livestock in the cabin throwing fits if they suspect you're too slow (shut your trap you offbeat womanchild before I gnaw on your ugly low-polygonal face without leaving the seat). In that particular thing - putting you in a bus driver's shoes - BS2k16 excels a lot, covering up for all possible bugs and drawbacks you may find. Don't buy it for full price though.",

Stability is OK, I didn't have any crashes. I don't monitor my FPS but I maxed out everything and performance is decent so not sure on what kind of calculators some people tried to run it. There is plenty of non-standard situations happening all the time and that keeps me interested. I just started to play it but I know I won't stop anytime soon. It's current, newest competitor about coach buses has much less interesting things to offer apart from better graphics and physics. Ultimately, I got them both but I think this one interests me more.",

I use one of my friends version or copy of this game, because he has more hours on it and he has a developed profile. After playing on his PC and comparing it to OMSI 2 with the Chicago DLC:  BS16 Pros: + It is simple + Has buttons that look like they can be clickable  + Somewhat realistic at a certain level + Cheaper than OMSI 2  + You don't need to learn a foreign language  Cons: - No TrackIR support - awful lot of buttons  - graphics feel a bit cartoonish at time to time - the MAN DLC isn't free even though the busses are supposed to have the logo as shown in the pictures  OMSI 2 Pros: + Realistic + Moddable + Challenging in a good way + AIs are programable  +TrackIR support  Cons:  - Pricey - some parts on the busses look like they are duds but actually work - Unless you have the Chicago DLC you have to learn a bit of Italian and German - people are always the same....the same annoying yet ugly people  - lags often   So which one would you choose, I honestly would go with OMSI 2 but BS16 is getting slow updates to make it better...",

        {
            "review_text": "It's no secret that I've got a soft spot for what some might cruelly call the 'mundane simulator' I've trucked and farmed my way through many a simulator title and I've loved them all. When I'm gaming I don't really discriminate between genres, being a gun toting super hero is fun but sometimes I just want to do something different, something normal that I'll probably never to get experience in my own 'real life' something alternative but 'mundane'.  I've come to terms with the fact that I'm firmly stuck in my rut in life, I'm never likely to be a truck driver or a farmer but these simulator games give you a chance to get a feeling of what it might be like, they give you a chance to experience a different life. It's the ultimate reality based escapism and it can definitely be a lot more fun than it sounds.  So I've hauled cargo across Europe, I've trucked around the USA and I've farmed until the cows came home but I've never been a bus driver. Today we're going to fix that!   Simple Life  Like a lot of jobs, on the surface it sounds pretty simple, I mean driving a bus, how hard could it be? You get to sit down all day and cruise around in a big circle, stopping every few minutes along the way. It doesn't sound too difficult does it? Your cargo even unloads itself! Ahhh to be a bus driver, that'd be a good life.  With this mind I fired up Bus Simulator 16 ready for some hard core bus based business but I soon learned that being a bus driver isn't just about driving a bus, there's a wealth of bells and whistles that go along with the job that complicate things, which is just as well because it adds a little depth to what would other whys be a pretty simple driving game with some pretty bland scenery, but we'll get onto that later.   The Wheels on the Bus...  First the driving mechanic, a pretty important part of any game which involves driving and has the word 'simulator' in the title. You'll have access to six different buses in the base game (who knows what DLC might bring) but for the most part this variety is purely cosmetic, the handling between each 'flavour' of bus feels identical and the driving experience is more arcade than simulator. Speed and handling feel a little off (not that I've ever driven a bus, but I've been a passenger on a few) and the ride itself always feels disconnected from the road, it's too smooth and floaty, there's no rumble of an uneven road surface, no potholes to avoid (or deliberately drive over to annoy the passengers).  The wheels on the bus might go round and round but there's no real sense that they're in contact with the road. This makes the driving part of Bus Simulator 16 a flat experience and that's a real shame.   The Buttons on the Bus  Whilst the actual driving physics are pretty basic there are still plenty of interactions with the vehicle to put some ticks in the simulation box. You get to turn the key to start your engine, flick the switches to put on the various lights both inside and outside the cab. There are buttons to raise and lower the bus and you even have a heater you can play with.  The simulation doesn't restrict you to sitting in the driver seat either, if you feel the need you can always pull over and get out to stretch your legs (or stare unnervingly at your passengers who pretend not to notice).   Tickets Please!  Bus Simulator 16 isn't just about driving a bus around, there are plenty of other things you'll need to take care of too. Some passengers will need to buy a ticket from you, sounds straight forward right? but there are different ticket types, single, student, weekly, etc. and do you think they'll have the correct change? Of course not! So you'll be working the ticket machine, selecting the ticket type and duration, printing out the tickets and calculating the correct change in your head all whilst you keep one eye on the clock. There's a time table to stick to and everyone hates it if the bus is late.   Pesky Passengers  It's not just the ticket sales which slow down the turnaround time either, some passengers might require extra help, a person in a wheelchair for example will need you to vacate the drivers' seat and put down the ramp for them to board the bus, of course you'll need to stow the ramp away again before you head off. There's also a high probability that the disabled passenger will actually want to get off your bus again at some point, that'll mean you've got another ramp based delay to look forward to as you drive the route.  The passengers don't even leave you alone when they've finally paid up and sat in their seats either. You'll be happily driving along, trying to make time back up on your route when you'll hear a moaning voice echo along the bus, 'I'm too hot' or 'It's too cold in here, can you do something about the temperature?'.... ughhh, so now you're having to mess around with the air con. whilst keeping an eye on the sat nav. and another on the road. You wouldn't want to crash or run down a pedestrian, that might hurt your profit margin (and be bad for whoever you hit of course).   Bus Mechanic 16  So you herd the cattle (Sorry, passengers) onto the bus and manage not to freeze them, cook them or crash them into anything but there are still other things which can delay you. Even if the traffic is clear, the passengers are behaving and the traffic lights are green things can still go wrong. The bus itself can work against you, there can be mechanical issues which require your attention. For example the doors could become jammed and your cargo (sorry, passengers) are a fickle bunch and don't seem to like the thrill of being chauffeured around with the doors wide open, they worry about silly little things like falling to their death. You can pull over and fix these mechanical annoyances but it all takes time... time you'll need to make up on the road if you don't want to be late.   Like the Back End of a Bus!  Visually the game is a little disappointing, it's not ugly but the textures are fairly plain. Don't go into this expecting photo realism, or even Truck Simulator quality graphics or you'll be disappointed by the view. Even at the highest settings the view distance on your rear view mirror is surprisingly low. You're constantly followed by what looks like really thick white fog pursuing you along the city streets, it's kinda scary really (Have you ever seen the Stephen King movie 'The Mist'?).  You're not just restricted to driving around one district either, as you progress in the game you'll be able to unlock 4 more to keep things interesting (the scary 'mirror fog' will follow you to these districts too!)   One Route to Rule Them All  In addition to all the thrills of driving a big old bus around there's also a management simulation aspect to Bus Sim 16. Keeping your passengers happy and the fares rolling in is good for company profits and that's good for you because you own the company. You can tweak the look and colour of your buses and cover them in adverts to bring in some extra revenue. You'll be setting up bus routes and hiring drivers to trundle along them all in the name of profit, profit which you can then re-invest in more buses and more drivers.   End of the Line  Bus Simulator 16 is an interesting title and whilst it can be fun there's no denying that it lacks a little polish. This is a niche game, it's not going to be for everyone, but if you're looking to try something a little different and think the life of a virtual bus driver might be for you then that's an itch this game will happily scratch.

I have a gtx 970 and i couldnt play the game on high because I only got like 50 fps. The camera angles are broken in this game. U cannot look in both side mirrors at the same time without moving ur over sensitiv mouse. U cannot regulated ur mouse sensitivity. Overall i dont find the game that entertaining",

            "review_text": "can I recommend this Bus simulator, well YES and NO. And let me start by saying that if you consider buying this or some other bus simulator then I would highly recommend you to buy bus and cable car simulator instead..  Well let me review Bus simulator 16 first, it is actual quite good and have allot of good things to offer for a low price. First of all the graphics are not 2016 std. and look a bit old, though it do not matter that much since where are here to drive a bus right ? ;-)  Well the city itself is create well and there is a mix of both ordinary recidential and more dence areas with sky scrapers and conventions centers, and that make it interesting to driver from a-z. The streets are filled with cars and pedestrians and sometimes even emergency vehicles that you need to let pass. It also happen that cars drive out in front of you or pedestrians almost walk on the street in front of you, so you need to keep your eyes open. Well I like these small events now and then it make the game interesting. One other things that make the game interesting is the ability to exit your seat and walk arround in the world and solve small problems. For example a drunk guy enters the bus so you have to get up and ask him to leave. And one in a while you also have to help handicapped people in/out of the bus by exit the bus and extending the ramp ;-)  The all new 'run a bus business' feature is nice, and you can even compare how well you are doing to other players though some have kind of unrealistic billion usd scores. Anyway you can also invite your friends to come and drive a trip in your bus and follow one of your routes that you create and it is kind of nice i think. It is also possible to paint your car and stick commercials on it to earn a little more, though It not really where that important to me.  Well the bus driving experience is kind of okay. The feeling of sitting in the seat and driving I would say is realistic and the bus feel big ect. And you can also press various keys and sell tickets ect.  The bus is also well made and in general give a good impression.  However the controls of the game are not that facinating. First of all the game do not yet support Trackir ( the dev. wrote on the forum that they consider implementing it ). So many people are now forced to use the mouse to look arround or setup X and Y key on their wheel to look left and right. No matter what it is not the same as trackir and free look with the mouse. ALso I really miss the ability to look 90 degrees left and right in the bus since it is hard to see the trafic when at a T crossing and only can look 75-80 degrees left and right.  Well all in all I think price level is good fair price for the product. The game is not bad, and have many nice features ( like you can hear small talk in the bus, such as boss i cant go to work today ). Also the get in and get out of the bus by passengers work pretty good, and you often fill your bus pretty good with passengers. I also like that sometimes there are events such as holliday where there are tons of passengers waiting for a ride.  The game it self work in such a way you unlock features by driving from a-b.. in about 3 hour of gameplay I am level 10-11 and have unlocked the biggest bus in the game and half of the map. To unlock more I need to play the game and get xp, but I can also solve some goals ( such as having 2 bus stops in each unlocked zone ect ).   All in all not a bad game but it do feel a bit like an arcade bus simulator, so I really prefer the older game named 'Bus and cablecar simulator' since the busses are a little more realistisc, and the game experience is just a bit more fun and realistic.",
