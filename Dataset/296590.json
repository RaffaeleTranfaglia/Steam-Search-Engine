Unfortunately plagued by a couple of bugs at the time of this review but this and the games relatively small scope can be forgiven for its low price point ($5 at the time of this review).

            "review_text": "I salute the people who have mastered this program and find it enjoyable. I found it gratuitously complicated and more akin to mastering the latest corporation productivity software than playing a game. I went into the program with high hopes. The artwork on the cards is good, the presenting lore was engaging and I've enjoyed other fantasy-based card games on Steam such as Magic the Gathering and Spectromancer. In fact the layout is very reminiscent of MTG which may have helped lull me into a false sense of familiarity. My first trepidation came during the tutorials. Guidance such as 'Moreover, your Life Drainer here has 'Extract 2' and the Albino Sorcerer has 'Extract 1'. The Extract X modifier allows you to increase the effect of your extractions.' is the norm as variables are abruptly piled on top of other variables in a triumph of complexity over depth. There's no drawing you in in small doses. It's quantum field theory from the first hello. I still might have given the program a qualified thumbs up but then after persevering through to a modicum of proficiency and investing a few nights, I realized the fun factor was just not there for me. So props to the folks who've mastered Draconian Wars and find it a deep strategic card game. Alas, I'm not one of them.",
