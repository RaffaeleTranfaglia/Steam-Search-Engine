If you are a fan of low-stress games with a relaxing atmosphere and graphical style, this will fit those aspects. A good game to have running while working on tasks or watching TV.  Dont expect to get your heart pumping with adrenaline or to be completely consumed with the story. A simple and basic game, but nice to watch growing if working on other activities. All that said, good game for a first time developer, considering how glitch free it is.  In any case, developer should keep developing games, but this game is not for everyone. Unless you like games that don't require your complete attention, then I can recommend this game.",
