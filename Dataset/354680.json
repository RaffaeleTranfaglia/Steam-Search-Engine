The gameplay is pretty good too, it is not too hard but also not too easy to figure out what exactly you are supposed to do.   The dialogue is awesome, the terrible puns are actually good :p Also, there's a character called Lord Arthwipe. If that doesn't want to make you play the game, then I don't know ;) Pretty excited for the next episode!",

There are lots of puns and some inside jokes as well (including a Dalek reference for them Doctor who fans). It was a fun hour and I'll be waiting for the next installments.",

            "review_text": "This game is a charming (if simple) point and click adventure game with excellent art, animation, and voice acting to round it out. There's a murder mystery afoot, but mostly you're playing a down-on-his-luck adventurer trying to make ends meet and avoid the fate of a 9-5 in 1884 England.   The puzzles and progression are simple and very direct, to the point that it didn't really take much thought, which may bore some. By far, the main draw of this game is the character design and smooth animation styles, with a lot of fun dialogue sprinkled throughout. I would wholehearted reccomend this to any point and click fan, but with the stipulation that it's enjoyment factor comes far more from the art direction than any satisfying puzzle solving.   I recieved this game on sale for $3 and felt wholly satisfied. Looking forward to part 2.",

Unfortunately this episode is rather short, only about a bit over an hour of playtime or so. So be aware of that when buying. Also the riddles could be a bit more complex, but the humorous way they are presented makes up for that.  Otherwise I think the money you pay is well invested to support an awesome indie project with a lot of potential for future episodes. A very lovable game indeed! Can't wait for the next part to come out! :)",

            "review_text": "I really, really wanted to like this game. The art style is rather enjoyable in its simplicity and I am very partial to the gothic, steampunk setting. The voice acting is even quite good. However pleassure hinges heavily upon the sense of humour of the player and mine was clearly incompatible. Endless puns and pop culture references, mixed with unfortunate innuendos and unneeded crassness. It played like a kid's game that got lost in a 16 rated world for some reason. Sadly, even there it doesn't cut it though, as the characters are universally, completely unlovable. Our hero is so dumb that he should be locked up and the only reason I could imagine he wasn't arrested for his various acts of grand larceny is that this world appears to have no police force.  'But what of the gameplay?' I hear you ask. 'Us lovers of a good murder mystery will put up with a lot in the name of a whodunnit and a brain teaser' Alas, no. Nothing here either. Collect everything you see on the screen - yes, even that icky thing over there. When encountering a puzzle or interactive object, try whatever you have by decreasing likelihood until Bertram rewards you with yet another ghastly pun. Thus the thin canvas of a painting provide a bridge when balanced right on rotting wood, silk becomes waterproof, a smelly loo brush turns into cotton candy, a rotting eyeball into a marble...you get the idea. The small action sequences are tedious rather than envigorating and will have you flailing suddendly for the keyboard after hours of point and click. The fact you have an oaf of a sidecick seems to be purely a gimick, as all that he does could easily be achieved by the protagonist {'Quick! Move the flimsy table!'} and his few lines make him sound like a fortune cookie.  Again, I really wanted to like the game and I feel terrible leaving such a bad review for a small, kickstarted indie game, but there it is: I thought the game was terrible and will definitely not be buying episode 2. If you can, give it a try and if the first ten minutes entertain you and make you laugh, you will enjoy the rest. If, like me, you were already cringing, then give it a miss.",
