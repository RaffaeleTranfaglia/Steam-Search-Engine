            "review_text": "When I started playing this game, the game looked similar to Pineview Drive. It turned out that Obscuritas was made by the same developers of Pineview Drive. Is it better or worse than Pineview Drive? Obscuritas is a lot better. Not a sequel but really good game.   I have always longed to play a game where I take an adventure through an abandoned carnival and amusement park, a haunted mansion, a madhouse, and an abandoned hospital all in one. Obscuritas is that adventure and is a love letter for all people who like abandoned amusement parks, hospitals, haunted mansions, mannequins, dolls and clowns. This game truly delivered the adventure well and I cannot be happier than that.   The graphics are very simple and gorgeous at the same time that nails the atmosphere well. The atmosphere and graphics reminded me of Pineview Drive obviously, F.E.A.R., Layers of Fear, and STALKER combined in one. It worked so well that it built a lot of suspense and terror that left me feeling scared without relying on cheap ♥♥♥ jumpscares that a lot of horror 'games' use. The scary tension and atmosphere must be inspired by the works of David Lynch and Hitchcock who are very well known for creating horror and mind-bending movies.   The gameplay is much better than Pineview Drive especially with less keys and more adventuring through different places. You just look around for clues and objects to help you solve puzzles and advance through the places to provide you a part to be in the story. But that method was executed really well for this game.   One of the better horror games I have played in a long time. A word of tip: do not let that doll mess with you. ;)  8.7 out of 10",
