Would recommend looking at that. - Auto-reload of weapons. I think it would make sense to do what other games do: reload weapons automatically.  - Doors opening automatically when player is in proximity. I sometimes have to bump into doors to open them. - I didn't like the bugs showing up behind me in rooms I had already cleared.   But overall, I like the artstyle and there are some slick elements to the game; especially for an indie. Would recommend checking out.",
