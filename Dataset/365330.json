    "description": "Jump/Boxer is a pseudo 8-bit action platformer with fighting game elements. As a young martial artist named Dag, players will make their way through each level using parkour-like abilities to overcome the various platforming challenges as well as engaging in combat with mechanics similar to those found in fighting games.",

Jumping puzzels are unforgiving and the game has a tendancy to jump straight up when you're trying to jump forward or fall while you're trying to double jump. Not sure if it's supposed to be high difficulty or if the code just needs to be tweaked a bit. Fighting was a bit of a letdown. Like so many of the titles of the era it's trying to emulate, spamming low kick will beat most fights easily.  BUT, hey it was fun for a little bit, the visuals were bright and had a 'Jet set radio' feel to them. Characters had a little personality to them. I think I would have been diappointed had I paid $5, but for a buck? Go for it. :)",

            "review_text": "I think I paid like a quarter for this game. Not worth a dollar. But a quarter? Sure. The game has a recurring bug involving hitting a ledge at a certain angle and you go flying up, waiting a long time to fall down. The dev obviously knows about this because I read about this on the review and it happened to me twice in fifteen minutes.   It's a reasonable game for less than a dollar. Pretty good tutorial. Takes a while to learn the mechanics so it makes you feel like you've learned something. But the fighting is completely useless. I don't even know why it was implemented.",
