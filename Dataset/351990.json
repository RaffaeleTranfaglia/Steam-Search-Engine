Loads up a track based on a song you put into it in about 10 seconds, and that track (if you choose the right songs) is almost always perfectly reflective of the song. Great to see what other people are racing to in the charts menu as well! You guys have done an awesome job with this game!",

            "review_text": "Edit: Disclosure: After some time making this review, I have worked on the game in a minor way. I don't think it affects this review but disclosing it to avoid confusion.  This game is the glorified personification of what happened in my brain when I was 18 years old and drove my -87 Ford Fiesta in a forest road with thight bends with Dragonforce - Through the fire and flames at full volume. The pedigree of the game shows clearly, the roots of Wipeout are there in a very good way both in graphics and gameplay (Cannot say for other games mentioned as inspiration as I have not played those). Even though the game is still in alpha/beta/early, it's got replayability for years already.   It does have few missing features, most obvious ones are the inadequate Options, incomplete gamepad support and some very minor graphical issue/feature that makes it difficult to see barriers when going very fast. To my knowledge, older gamepads don't work but apparently devs are working on it.",

            "review_text": "Must be the music I like, since even the slow music sometimes throws me off the track with ramp after ramp after ramp. That being said ...  This is a great game. It's quite enjoyable to run the tracks trying to get a decent score while listening to music you enjoy.  Most of my music is two stars, with a few three stars, and I've had a few pop up as four stars. I've yet to see a five star song from my music ... Maybe I should be careful what I ask for, as four star songs are pretty wild!  The way you get points is by doing stunts. You keep ahead of the first bar for maximum points. Just driving doesn't get you anything, although you can use periods where you need to just drive to collect coins (for buying different cars and skins) and boost pack thingies (that you can use to activate your own boost whenever you want ... provided you've collected enough of them).  You always take about the same amount of time to make it through the track, so to get points you do stunts. You run over ramps, getting as much air time as possible. To get more points, you hit the ramps so the car spins ... but this comes with a number of issues that really justifies the extra score. For instance, if you hit the ramp wrong, it's possible to land on your roof, or be flung from the map altogether! So be very very very careful jumping, especially if you plan on doing the high scoring spins!  You also get points by drifting. I suppose this can be abused, but whenever I've used drifting unnecessarily, I've always bounced off the walls. Great way to fall behind, thus losing points!  When you use the boost, it helps you get caught up, or you can use it just before a series of jumps to get ahead of the bar, increasing your point yield. I'm the sort who tries to get more bang for my buck, so I always try to optimize when I use it. But I rarely play the same track twice in a row, so it's always something of a gamble for me.  If you play the same track over a few times to get the highest score you can, you won't have to wait for it to rebuild the track. But if you go to another track, then come back to the first one, you'll have to wait for it to be rebuilt. There's a 'tip' that says that 'you only have to wait the first time you play the track,' but this is not entirely true. It is only true if you play the track repeatedly, a few times in a row.  Also, there are barriers on the road. If bouncing off the walls, landing upside down after a trick jump, or flying clean off the road, aren't enough reasons to set you back, they stuck barriers on the road that will slow you down quite a bit. Since you need to keep ahead of the first line to optimize your scoring, this can be quite a problem!  You also lose points for every barrier you hit, so it's a good idea to avoid them for more than one reason.  It can play m4a files, but not aac files. Not a terribly large issue, just something to be aware of. I do not know what other files it can play, as my library seems to be a mix of m4a and aac files.  On difficulty: 1 star - Very casual. I think I've seen only one or two of these songs. Maybe the Beehtoven one I played was one? I don't recall. 2 star - Casual. This is where most of my music lands. It actually has quite a diverse range of difficulty in this range. 3 star - Normal. You really have to start using all the tools it gives you to keep up here. It can sometimes be pretty wild. 4 star - Hard. It's beginning to get wild here. I've had about half a dozen of my tracks come up like this. It leaves me crying with laughter at every surprise twist and turn it gives me, and it's hard to make normal jumps ... let alone the high point yield twisters, here! 5 star - Insanity? I've yet to see a song this hard, but I'm pretty sure most people would be falling off the track quite a bit here. The maps may even be nearly unplayable!  I generally listen to Indie music. I look at the top tracks, and I don't see anything I actually have in my library on them, so I guess I can not race against the 'most popular' track leaders. In point of fact, it's pretty rare for me to play a track anyone else has played, so maybe I have it a bit easier than most people who play the game getting coins.",

If you come in expecting the racing game equivalent of Beat Hazard.... really, this is not much of a racing game. You never race against other cars, it's all... kind of like a 'time trial' but with points. By default, you don't even accelerate or brake!   If you accept it as 'just imagine if Audiosurf was a car drifting game', then it's fun.  You just steer, boost, and drift (and drift and drift), on these insanely long rollercoaster tracks. Using ramps to jump and roll, avoiding obstacles. Drifting and jumping score points. It's addictive, almost hypnotic.  Most of all, it's a new way to enjoy your MP3 collection, and to me, that's worth a lot. :)  I do wish this game could connect to the streaming sites, e.g. Spotify, Google Music, Amazon Prime Music, or whatever. There are so many tracks I own but aren't actually downloaded.  BTW - I got this at 75% off in a sale and have no regrets. At the full price, however, I may have written this review grumbling about the game needing more features, diversity in track layouts, etc.",

            "review_text": "I absoloutely adore this game. Its exactly what it says on the tin, Wipeout meets Audiosurf. But its a satisfying marriage that sometimes has moments that even best its lovely parents.  PROS - Tight controls and physics, even in midair. If you fall to your doom it feels like your fault (usually :p). - Simple score system that has lots of aspects to it. When to boost? When to jump and when to go off those flips? When to start drifting for the longest drift? Little things can go a long way when going for highscores. - Unlockables. Its a little thing, but I always love unlockables. Gives you more reason to play beyond mechanical reasons (which the game does wonderfully mind you) - Nice, (generally) cohesive graphics that can run on any ol toaster like mine :) - You can sort of snake with practice. Givin' me the GX goosebumps ooh. - Ghosts are very well done and racing them gives a good competetive feel.  CONS - Gui is servicable but text and buttons are too large. Text doesn't scroll when selecting new tracks so if a song has a long album/artist combination you can't read the track name :&lt; - Surprisingly even with unlockables, customization is minimal. Theres no graphics options, Audiosurf 1 alone had selectable 'intensity' colours and custom skyboxes. I would prefer if I could choose the track type for a song as proper genre data isn't always available so you get stuck on 'Dance' a lot. - There are some rare issues with track generation. For instance, 'The Hamster Alliance - Falling Through The Air' has a jump that you can rarely make without boosting. This is a reoccuring issues it seems from the bug report page. It makes tracks that would otherwise be low difficulty have a semi-frustrating aspect to them, cause you have to count jumps and remember which ones are death traps. - There isn't proper leaderboards or statistics. You have to load a song to see the leaderboard. I know for a fact my highest score is about 210k but the game doesn't list that anywhere that I've seen. Also, doesn't have the cool aspect of Audiosurf where you had to try and keep your thrones. I loved that, was a good way to bring you back into the game.  TL;DR, super fun singleplayer race/music game, with a degree more customization and a gui overhaul it will really shine.",

There is a zen-like quality to drifting and chaining back to back corners that would seem to pair itself incredibly well to music based or 'rhythm' gaming. It took only a few minutes to realize that I would not be enjoying this game much at all. Unfortunately the 'drifting' is horrendous.   I wasn't expecting too much, something akin to what is in a basic cart racing game. What ruins it is the complete lack of counter-steering. For those not familiar with counter-steering, it is the practice of turning your wheels opposite to the direction you turned to initiate the drift in order to maintain the cars balance to remain drifting instead of simply spinning out. It is the single most crucial aspect of drifting and Riff Racer misses it entirely.   So what does this mean in terms of gameplay? It means that being able to guide your car and maintain a drift while sideways is effectively removed. You initiate the drift with a button press and then rely on the angle of your entry point along with your speed to remain drifting while continuing to spam the drift button. If you try to counter steer and maintain your drift the car immediately gains traction and sends you out of the drift and into the wall. It's a mind-boggling design decision that ruined the experience for me almost before it began.",

Compared to similar games like Audiosurf (which is also very enjoyable), Riff Racer has only one mode, but the driving is more akin to a real racing game. The car can move across the entire racetrack, which is dotted with barricades, jump ramps, and boost cubes. The driving itself is simple in concept, but challenging to master. The main mechanic is drifting, which is my favorite part of the game. Trying to push your luck to get a long chain is nerve racking and exhilarating. High scores do not come easy, which adds to the fun.  Positives: -Race tracks correspond extremely well with songs  -Can play on edited songs -Drifting mechanic is very exciting once you get a hang of it  -A very competitive community  Negatives: (Although I call them negatives, these are more nick-picks than anything else) -Some tracks can be frustrating in the positioning of ramps and barricades. When I find these tracks, I just fight through and move on -The barricades can sometimes be unavoidable since you cannot see them after a jump or they blend into the color of the track  -The user interface is a little wonky with a controller  Overall, Riff Racer is very enjoyable and worth a try.",

Of course, the controls are the only real element of challenge the game has next to the procedural generation semiregularly producing horrible camera angles or impossible segments of track.

The Controls are annoying if you use the keyboard but are quite enjoyable if you use a xbox controller. For me, it runs quitely and doesn't have input lag, which a lot of racing games seem to fail at. The ability to turn the different sounds up or down (Music and Everything else are two different catagories.) is very nice to have too... again most racing games have 1 set sound level adjuster.   It has decent graphics and colors that don't kill people by being so unbeleivably neon that it's painful. (It has nice colors.) Racing against a ghost is really nice, and reminds me of Sonic and SEGA Allstars racing's ghost mode. It would be awesome if there was a flat out 2-16 Car race mode though. There could be more cars, custom paint jobs, and maybe even different vehicle types.  I think it is well worth the money, as I have played it way too much already, for only having it for like 1 and a half weeks. A few songs I played: Metalingus by Alter Bridge Almost all of the 2 My Chemical Romance Albums: Danger Days and The Black Parade A few Silversun Pickups songs My Demons By Starset A few Hank Karr songs I'm so sorry by Imagine Dragons Electric Love by BORNS And a load of others.  Do what Shia Labouef would want.... 'Just Do It' and get the game, because unless you hate music and racing, this game can be extraordinarily fun. P.S. Don't rage at songs like My Demons by Starset because they have unbeleivably tight turns that ARE possible... Nobody likes a party pooper.  I rate this game 9/10. But anyways, stay crispy.

However, if you dont have any electronica, it is still moderately fun and therefore I would reccomend getting it when it is on sale.  ---  As of this review I have played this game for about an hour trying 2-3 tracks of each genre that I own. They were rock, classic rock, classical, post metal hardcore, heavy metal, power metal, orchestral (think cinematic music), folk, glitch hop, drum n bass, and hard dance. The only genres that the race tracks have a feel to, where every jump, drift and loop really felt like it was part of the music were the last 3. All electronic.  It really bums me out as I am a huge fan of orchestral, folk, and classical and that is what my library largely consists of. When racing against any track that didnt have a bass drop, a synth, or a 'wub' the game would place whatever it could when it wanted. Racing against any other genre of music will feel either too slow or too fast. Don't get me wrong though, I  won't  be refunding this as I do have a collection of electronica that I would love to race.  To conclude, no matter what kind of music you own, this game is not worth $15 unless you are a HUGE fan of racing games. I would otherwise reccomend it at maybe -30% off or lower.",
