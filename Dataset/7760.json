Never forget to research new technologies, then construct the results. There is no tutorial, once you position and name your first base, you are entirely on your own. If you have never played it before I'd reccomend either Xenonauts, which is VERY similar but slightly mordenized or the new XCOM game, which is more simple and user-friendly.",

            "review_text": "There are games that are good. There are games that make you addicted. Then there is XCOM...  It's the end of the 20th century. In response to growing alien threat, few governments decide to fund and XCOM organisation, solely dedicated to neutralising forementioned threat. Player becomes Commander of the force.   Game consists of two levels. On the Geoscape, you manage bases, research (come on, all this sweet loot left by deceased gray cabbage. I know you want it.), manufacture and more. Starting with single base (preferably western europe, you have radar coverage over whole Europe, part of Russia and Northen Afrcia), few soldiers and fighters equipped with conventional terrestial weapons. It is sufficient for the first few weeks, but after recovering UFOs and aliens, both dead and in custody, you will get better equipment: Laser weapons with unlimited ammo, powerful plasma-based armament, durable armors, UFO-looking fighters or even possibility to make your soldiers use their Psionical abilities against aliens. But to get this, you need to get some UFOs down. Send an Interceptor, and use his persuasive rockets to make aliens crash. Then, Tactical level starts.   Before engaging remaining UFO personel, you have to equip them: only equipment on the Skyranger (XCOM troop transport) will be aviable. Then you investigate crash/landing site, eliminating survivors of the crash and savaging their technology (ones that havent been destroyed during firefights, that is). Honestly, these are emotions: when panicked rookie accidently kills enemy Muton (typical tank) that was hidden in the fog of war with a rocket launcher, ready to kill my whole squad. Taking your first Etheral alive (remembering these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s can mind control ♥♥♥♥ out of you). The moment you have to choose wheather to lose your best soldier and have few remaining ones get back to Skyranger to escape, or risk all of them to finish the mission. Taking out your first allien base. Oh, yes, different mission types.   Other than fighting with crashed/landed UFO crews there are few more battle types. In order to make XCOM look incompetent, aliens can launch a Terror mission on one of the cities. In these missions, your score is determined not only by your casualities compared to the aliens killed, but also civilians alive at the end of the mission. Not engaging in this type of mission makes it almost certain that nation will sign a secret pact with aliens and leave XCOM project. On the other hand, when you encounter 10 chyssalids on the terror mission (community hated, extremly dangerous terror unit), that country can go **** itself.  Having a base close to the battlefield makes everything a bit easier. Therefore, it sould be no suprise that aliens will try to build bases on the earth. For you it's a pretty nice target: tremendous amount of artifacts can be salvaged, as long as you manage to neutralise the crew. To make it all a bit more balanced, you might find that one of your bases (you should have few of them, to have world covered by radars) will have visitors from outer space. Just saying. Last mission type is obviously visit on the Red Globe, where you put end to alien invasion. IF you won't get destroyed by the time you are ready.  Research and Manufacturing are important parts of the game, though simple: Labs discover and invent things, and engineers make them. Amount of the research topics is also worth mentioning, since there are no fewer than 60 topics, most of them giving new items, few of them giving you UFOpaedia entries, and few ones required to go to Mars.  Overally, i find it quite sad, that this game is much more complex than many modern games. If you manage to get through ancient graphics and interface, a bit challenging controlls and few other tiny problems, you get very good and addictive strategy.",

            "review_text": "Okay, my original version of this review was terribad so I've decided to redo it to do this game justice. First and foremost, this is one of the best games ever made. It has been over 20 years since this game was originally released and it is still every bit as good now as it was back then. Not even Enemy Unknown (Expect a lot of comparisons by the way) can quite match up to how enthralling this game is.   So let's get some problems out of the way first; As much as I wish XCOM: Enemy Unknown would let you have more than a maximum of 6 soldiers in a mission at once, this game goes completely ♥♥♥♥ing overboard with it. At first it's not too bad, letting you initially field 14 soldiers a mission at once. It gives you a generous amount of troops without it being too unwieldy. However late game once you get the final transport you can field 26 soldiers a mission. This not only makes soldiers feel a little too expendable (Which can lead to some pretty hilarious things to happen when your higher ranking officers are in trouble) it also makes some battles incredibly laborious especially when you're unloading your troops from the transport. Then there is the user interface which will be completely baffling for new players. Seriously, it can take a while to actually get used to it. If you can get past it, though, then I guarantee you will fall in love with this game.   Okay now that that is out of the way; The actual strategic battles that take place are perfect. Fully destructable environments combined with every weapon being able to freely target any tile adds countless strategic value and can make or break any situation. Then there is the time units system. As great as the two move system in Enemy Unknown is, it doesn't exactly work as well as the time unit system in UFO Defense. Let me explain: Time units act as a kind of currency given to each unit on the field in order to perform any action be it moving, crouching, shooting, or looting. Oh yeah, that's another thing that's better about this game, you can loot dead enemies as well as fallen XCOM soldiers. This is a really good feature that allows you to have tiny victories by letting you take some alien artifacts or carcasses even when the aliens have almost completely annihilated your forces. Then there is also the game's night missions. Unlike in Enemy Unknown, depending on where the battlefield is taking place, night missions can be legitimately creepy and frustratingly difficult early game. It helps to build this really tense atmosphere that even in late game still retains a little bit of its magic, and it's only amplified if there's a chryssalid lurking around.   Okay now let's move on to the Geoscape... well there is a lot more micro management in this part than both the Battlescape and Enemy Uknown combined. I personally like it; it makes me feel more like I'm running a military base with all the little things that ultimately don't add much value to the overall game, but are pretty nice to have anyway. However I will always always ALWAYS prefer this Geoscape over Enemy Unknown's Geoscape. Why? Because this Geoscape actually let's you be proactive by letting you patrol your interceptors over areas that seem to have a lot of UFO activity instead of that god awful satelite mechanic in Enemy Unkown (which I will explain in more detail why it is bad in my review of Enemy Unknown once I finish the game.) The interceptor battles themselves don't have much more depth in this game, but they go by so fast it's not a glaring issue. Also, deploying your troops to deal with aliens doesn't run as much of a risk of losing a country's support as it does in Enemy Unknown, and as a result makes the aftermath of the council report much less annoying.   There are some things that I haven't addressed about this game in this review, but it's already long enough and I feel I've covered all the important stuff... Even if this turned into an old XCOM vs new XCOM, but after playing both games a lot it's really hard for me not to compare them. It's still amazing how well this game has aged over a couple decades as opposed to others, and I still stand by what I said in the first paragraph that XCOM: UFO Defense is one of the greatest games of all time. 10/10 (Because I can't refrain myself from giving games I review a score)",

While the graphics are incredibly dated, but for being 20 years old (and counting) aren't bad at all. I highly recommend finding the Open Xcom mod after downloading, it updates the UI and makes the game playable by modern standards and fixes many, many bugs (and is the only way I play the game). The formula made familiar by the new game is if anything stronger and more sandbox-y as you get complete control over your base layout, your teams are 14 instead of 7 and there are a lot more events and pressures than the new one. It is also much harder, but as a result more rewarding when you beat it.  The only real negative is the lack of a strong cover system (it's fine, but not the awesome system from Enemy Unknown).

As a squad tactics turn-based strategy game, it's by no means for the faint-hearted, as overly-aggressive tactics are almost always promptly punished with the loss of one (or more) of your own units. This is a game where being OCD can usually pay off.  Featuring a massive tech tree for both the aircraft to shoot down UFOs, and for your ground forces to have better weapons and armor to defeat whatever aliens may actually make it to the ground, not to mention the amount of detail put into the game's research entries, the game has a sound amount of content.  The actual combat is solid, featuring mostly destructable terrain, and a lot of gratification for successful operations, and plenty of chaos for a turn-based game. It's detailed enough for a strategy-game fan to get immersed in, if he/she so wished.  All in all, it's an often-overlooked gem that I believe everyone should play at least once.",

With plenty of Technology, lore, and strategy, you will be sinking endless hours into this game. HOWEVER, this game takes ages to complete, maybe longer than anyone has to spare. Also, I had to look online to fix a lagging emulator. But after less than five minutes of searching, I had the game running. OVERALL for $5, why wouldn't you buy the game!?

Hopefully the presented claim is only little exaggeration. *UFO Defense* gameplay includes multiple aspects such as financial and supply management, base construction planning, research and manufacture organisation, big view world-defense with hypersonic jet planes and later innovative solutions; soldier recruitment and training, as well as turn-based tactical ground combat that the reviewed product pioneered in great extent. Recovery of alien artifacts and technology with their adaptation to Earth-based equipment is crucial to ones development in pursuit of defeating an enemy, whose abilities and ravagery increase with time.  Memories of fine hours dedicated to exploring the world endangered by alien invasion - and its only shield, the international X-COM force - brought me back to this product. I am still under impression of its uniqueness. Nevertheless, for present day, this DosBox version - that STEAM claims to be Windows-compatible - is far from working acceptably. Five euro/dollars for a program older than twenty years is robbery considering the current standards. If you are going to buy *UFO Defense*, do it only for the sake of *OpenXcom* - a fan-made and well done upgrade that greatly enchances the playability of the game, next to optimizing it for modern systems. *OpenXcom* requires the original *UFO Defense* data. Know, yet, that this data are remote files that ought to be available for free already.  Is this game difficult? Whether it is difficult or easy for someone who already knows how to play it, is one thing - but to learn how to play it on minimum required level, is other thing - and that may be tough; be warned. It is a nostalgia purchase nowadays. User-friendliness is hardly a feature here.  I truly admire *UFO Defense*, as well as impressive input that the fandom had into making it so much better experience, therefore I need to be fair with what we get on STEAM at the moment [2016] for the price of five euro/dollars: thumbs down. DosBox version is out of play.",

Pros: - Customization is out of this world, literally. - Sense of accomplishment you get from completing missions is huge, the battles can really be hard and when you come home with all your guys after the mess you had to mop up it really feels like you accomplished a lot. - Some may hate the difficulty of this game, but I love it. The aliens really are very intellegent, and if you make too many mistakes it is over. - Love the ability to have to work your way through the game with balance, you have to research, manufactor and choose your battles wisely.  Cons: - This game is old, the graphics are really out of date. Not a big deal to me, but for some this could be a problem. - There are some bugs that are very frustrating, including corrupted saves.  - Ground combat is clunky, not very fluid.  - Game difficulty can be very frustrating.",

Invest in aircraft to shoot down UFOs, fly to the crash sites and mop up the remaining aliens before they get away! You can take alien artifacts and research them to figure out what they do, replicate and manufacture them for yourself, and gain vast knowledge of the unknown enemy. You can even take alien corpses and preform an autopsy to gain knowledge of the way each specific type of alien even goes about functioning. In this game, knowledge is power. The first thing I recommend EVERYONE research is laser tech, makes the beginning of an EXTREMELY difficult game a little bit easier. SO MUCH MORE TO THIS GAME but not enough space to put it all.",

Today a lot of people call the game hard, and the user interface cluttered, and difficult to understand. And although this is all true, it adds to the satisfaction of killing the bad guys, and finding out the origins of the threat that plagues the earth.  These days I don't have as much time to play as I did back then, but when I do get the chance, I will occasionally still hop in the Skyranger to hunt some invading aliens.",

Initially, when I first played it back in 2001, I didn't know any strategies, secrets, tactics, hints, guides, or helpful advice existed. I just played and got my squads wrecked, over and over again. But, I kept playing. It was that good! Ten years later, I played it again, because I learned about the strategy guides which exist now. The game was even more exciting, because I could control the battles. Again I played in 2014, refreshing my experience and reliving the plight of X-Com. Anyway, down to the details.  The graphics, by today's standards, are cheesy, super-pixelated and difficult to interpret (at times). Even cheesier is the quality of music/sound effects. However, the sound is probably the single most-definitive characteristic in the game. The ominous sound effects severely impact the immersion in the battle. Without realizing it, I get sucked into the tension, because of the ominous pulsating background noise. Finally, the turn-based battlescape strategy style which beckons for perfection. Master strategists would struggle to survive some of those battles. One word: Chryssalids.  TLDR: Sci-Fi themed, turn-based strategy (with a side of Real-time Spaceship chase scenarios), in-depth immersion.   P.S. - If you can't beat em, get a bigger Blaster Launcher.",

It's sole purpose is to combat a growing extraterrestrial threat on Earth and investigate the reasoning behind this.

When not in combat, players are thrown into a real-time management stage where they can allocate and coordinate their resources towards fighting the aliens.
