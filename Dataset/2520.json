Its has a really nice art style, some cool and unique power-ups, and some pleasant music. HOWEVER.  Its very slow, the controls are very special to say the least and the game itself gets a bit repetetive. 6/10.",

Even thought it is more detailed and beautiful than those two, it still feels like it came out of a game template maker or something.  The mouth sound effects the character makes was bad. The movement is too floaty. And it is just bad in general, i do not recommend it.  Nightsky is more challenging, and Gish has more grip and feels better than this. Go buy those instead.",
