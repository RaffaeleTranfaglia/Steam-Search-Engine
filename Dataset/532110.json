I have played all their games in the past year and I am very happy that they made the big step to steam and purchaseable games.  Rusty Lake: Roots is the second game available on steam and it is amazing. At first it seems a bit too easy, but don't worry, this is just to get you started. The puzzles get trickier and more complex.  Rusty Lake delivered again! A studio that aims serve their customers well (they fixed a bug within 4 hours after publishing), that offers their games for a very reasonable price, and a studio that obviously loves their creations. I am absolutey amazed by their creative and hard work and I am looking forward to the next adventure!  If you like Roots, there's another game on Steam called 'Rusty Lake Hotel'. I highly recommend you play this.",

There's no reason not to play every entry of Rusty Lake in this life, or the next (or your previous life, for that matter). The past is never dead. It is not even past.  There will be blood.",

I would highly reccomend this game to anyone who is a fan of the point and click ganre. If you are hesitent on picking up this game; play though the many cube escape series also by Rusty Lake. Those games are free online flash games.",

My only complaint is that some of the puzzles have no sort of hint as to what you're supposed to do or where you're supposed to go, which can result in a lot of time just trying to figure out the base mechanics. They include walkthroughs though, so that's not too bad.",

I think it lacked the awesome disturbing feel of murdering and cooking sentient animals and then feeding them to their animal friends. It tried to match the atmosphere of Rusty Lake Hotel but failed by not giving the characters any emotion at all, always dead pan(and though that might have been creepy I think you'll get what I'm talking about if you play it)  I was also dissapointed with the fact that Roots strayed from the traditional obssession with the cubes, the memories. It was, well upsetting to see they had changed from what was apperently travelling through and changing memories(an great concept) to what seemed to be boring, tired old time travel. And the cubes, so far Rusty Lake has done a great job in building up a feeling of foreboding and horror whenever you see one of the cubes, I mean extracting memories to make these cubes and why?  Also it didn't continue with the story of Dale Vandermeer(which for those of you who don't know means Dale of the lake(Illuminati confirmed)) though the Vanderboom's(of the tree) might be somehow related...  BUT Rusty Lake is a great game and I reccomend it",
