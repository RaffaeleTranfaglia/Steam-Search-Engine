            "review_text": "This Game is an outstanding game. The graphics are quite nice and the music is at a good volume. Its creative plot is well thought out and consistent. Candlelight is a really fun game with a cute candle as a main character. This indie platform title keeps you challenged but is not overly frustrating. The controls are picked up easily and aren't overly complicated. Some levels are very interesting and really stick out over the rest, such as the 'Indiana Jones' and 'Alice' inspired levels. 10/10 would play again.",
