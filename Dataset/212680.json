The game that finally made me try my hands at modding. The game that made me realize that I relish masochism in videogames. The game that made me talk in Lanius-speak. The game that made me fear and worship Giant Alien Spiders. The one game that even after losing hundreds of hours to, I keep coming back for more. ... This is that game. I already lost over 1000 hours of my life playing, researching, modding, watching videos or otherwise discussing this game. If I had those hours back, I would gladly GLADLY lose them again.",

It looks over simplistic at first, but there are several layers to discover, strategies and random events to make every attempt to beat the game challenging, unique and a lot of fun (expect most attemps will fail). It quickly became one of my favorites in my library of 1300+ games.  This game is not for everyone, but if you like difficult turn-based strategy (combat is actually 'real-time with pause'), sci-fi, single player and roguelikes/permanent-death, you cannot go wrong with this one. It's definately not a game for those who only enjoy action games and mindless shooting and running. It takes a only a few hours to complete a game if you make it to the end, but you will probably have to restart several dozen of times before you reach that point in the first (unless you play in easy mode, which I never tried so I don't know).  That being said, it you are not turned off by anything I wrote, buy FTL immediately. Gameplay is absolutely fantastic and addictive.",

            "review_text": "'Just a few hit points on the hull, and these are the final moments of FTL. My sweaty hands press sweaty buttons as the flagship bears down upon the S.S. A-Hole. If only my Mom could see me now.'  Let’s start off with the basics — FTL is a Rogue-LITE. There’s permadeath, but that’s about the only thing that really connects it to the classic concept of a rogue-like game. In fact, I think FTL is basically its own classification. I’ve never really played anything quite like it before, and it was refreshing to see a new concept on the market.  Let’s talk about the pros.   FTL’s gameplay is super solid. So far, I’ve come across no bugs at all, everything works as it should. The tutorial correctly explains each mechanic, and they’re each so simple that I thought at first the game would be a dud. Oh boy, how I was wrong. These simple mechanics scale into a huge atmosphere of strategy, where each move you make could decide your life or death in the final battle with the flagship.   Just like in XCOM, you get attached to your crew super quickly, and when one dies it’s almost enough to rage quit. Each race manages to bring a different component to your crew, which again adds to the overall strategy.  The combat relies on your micromanagement of different weapons, and your outfit in general. It’s satisfying to find a weapons strategy that destroys the enemy. Thankfully, there isn’t just ONE strategy to choose from, although they all revolve around your opponent’s shields.  'One by one, my crew members are dead. The shields are down, the weapons turn orange, this is the end. But I know I just need a one more shot. I can do this.'  Them cons tho.  FTL does fall short in a few instances, and none bigger than the lore. If FTL could create a real world around it’s fantastic gameplay, the game would be SO MUCH BETTER. Also, the text-heavy encounters try to be physiologically difficult to decide on, but honestly it’s super easy to figure them out.   Another large shortcoming is the lack of weapon variety and quest variety. Even with the expanded universe I find quests that I’ve already done and are super easy to do again with my foreknowledge. I just can’t see myself replaying this with so little variety.  'One second. The weapon is charged, but so is his. They both fire.'",

            "review_text": " This is a long review, so if you just want a quick summary of this game please skip to  Results  and read from there.   Subset Games makes an amazingly epic choose your own adventure space combat game.   Similar to a storybook FTL: Faster than Light allows you to choose destinations to approach with each location giving you a dialogue with options explaining events at the chosen location.    Campaign:  You play as a federation ship whose mission is to fly throughout eight space sectors in order to deliver vital information to federation fleet. The rebels are taking over the entire space system and you must fight tooth and nail to achieve victory. In each system you will run across a variety of different individuals from Pirates, Aliens, Bandits, Slavers, Smugglers, Merchants, and Humanitarians who all trove the galaxy. As the game progresses you build a ship, stock it with a crew, maintain base systems, and complete quests. The end of the game is a three part battle with an monstrous flagship which unless equip can be near impossible. FTL: Faster Than Light is a fun game that’s highly addictive and keeps you wanting to come back for more. The combat is gripping, the constant threat of an oncoming fleet of rebels keeps you moving, and the amazing scenarios make you want not. This fantastic game although great has its limitations and may not be for everyone. FTL is a hard game, even on the easiest difficulty it is no cakewalk. Advanced Edition Content adds new items to the game adding more complexity and difficulty to an already hard enough situation.    Gameplay:  The game plays rather smoothly. Each “jump” you do acts as a turn and allows for the rebel fleet to progress further through a sector of the galaxy. If you and the rebel fleet cross paths you enter a battle, which if you play your cards right you can escape or even win. There is a steep learners curve, but once you’ve figured out the general game mechanics FTL plays rather easily. You have the ability to pause the game during any battle in order to maneuver troops and properly decide how to place your shots. The game asks you scenarios and the result of them are entirely dumb luck, so be prepared to take chances. For example you may end up trying to communicate with an alien race and get great rewards or an equal possibility is that crew member may die. The battles can be very intense and there can be situations where you are perfectly equip and the luck of where an asteroid lands can completely change a guaranteed victory into a struggling brawl.    Difficulty:  This game has a lot of luck involved, so about half of the difficulty in this game is the luck and not the skill. Although this may seem to make the game look bad, it offers variability that many games do not. You will be on your toes not just because of the difficulty from the actual skill of the game, but also because anything can happen and in one foul swoop you’re ship and crew will be gone. If you want examples of why please comment as I have many examples where I have lost because of luck, but don’t worry I also have lots of why I have lost because of skill as well haha.    Hints:    1)  Make sure you visit every possible point you can for each sector, fight off as many enemies as possible because every piece of scrap matters and you will need it all if you want to win.  2) Make sure you take advantage of your crew, the longer they man a station the more efficient they become at it. 3) It’s a good idea to have a crew member in every station that placing one in can provide a benefit to your ship.  4) The mind control device is probably one of the best ways to distract an enemy ship’s crew and help easily destroy the ships interior.  5) The enemy ships will always have weapons of equal charge time charged before you. 6) The best way to give yourself first shot advantage is the cloaking field, it is worth saving up for. 7) The Flagship has four guns, the best way to defeat it is to defeat the crewmember manning each gun. 8) In my opinion the best way to defeat the flagship is with as many flak cannons as you can get (and possibly a missle that teleports itself), the cloaking field, and mind control. This will allow you to control a crew member of the enemy ship, go invisible while you recharge your weapons, and garantee you hit through the flagships shields.  9) If you kill every person in the flagship an AI takes over which is a lot harder than if you just leave someone alive (try and kill everyone except one person that way you can use them with your mind control).     Results: FTL is an amazing game, but it’s not for everyone. The graphics are not top of the line and the difficulty level is high enough to make you want to strangle someone. FTL offers so fantastic fights that really keep you on the edge of your seat coupled with fantastic variety making each play through feel like a new game. If you quit a game it will create a save, but you can only load that save one time meaning that if you die you must start over. I recommend FTL, and would even recommend paying full price, but if get this on a sale it is definitely a steam-steal.   Pros: +Amazing depth and variety throughout the campaign +Option to play with or without advanced edition content +Loads of different weapons to choose from +Quests and distress signals to keep you invested in each sector +Choose your own path so you can preemptively target your gameplay. +Epic space battles that focus on managing both the interior and exterior of a ship.  +Many different ship designs, but good luck getting them unless you plan to invest several hundred hours into this game.  +Different sector types that offer different combat and elements.   Cons: -The choice results are random, there are a lot of take your chance situations. -The battles can be decided by dumb luck rather than skill. -The final boss battle (the flagship) is rediculously difficult. [for advice check the hints section] -FTL has a lack of resolution settings and in windowed mode it looks like is barely 1024x768 and does not allow you to make it larger.",

Even on it's 'Easy' mode, it took me multiple runs through the game before I even made it to the last sector. It took me countless more runs to finally defeat the boss, and let me tell you, the first time you defeat the enemy flagship it is immensely gratifying.  Everything about this game is fun. The combat mechanics and how you manage your ship is very clever, and you have to be constantly vigilant in a fight, lest your enemy get in that fatal hit on you. In a lot of the text-based encounters, there's a risk-vs-reward factor, where going in and say, investigating an abandoned space station might net you some extra scrap metal, but you might also lose your best Pilot in the process. The variety in ships you use and of those you can encounter is aplenty, and any number of different playstyles can be used with varying degrees of success.  The little things about it are great too: there's just enough background information to hold the plot together, while also leaving lots to your imagination. The graphic style is quite charming, and every note of the soundtrack works perfectly in tandem with what's going on in the game.  All in all, a great little indie title, for a very reasonable price. 9/10",

            "review_text": "It's not often that a strategy game takes my interest, but when this turned up in a Humble Bundle (which I bought because of Bastion, Limbo and FEZ) it blew my mind away. I had heard of FTL of course and had seen it in the Steam Store, but it never received a second glance from me because the main image for FTL looks so boring! Just look at it for a second; about twenty orange ships moving lazily across a planet. There's no sign of speed or that they're going Faster Than Light, and it gives nothing away about what the game is all about.  Maybe that's a good thing, because the game is bloody brilliant! You are the controller of a nameable vessel and you have information about the rebel fleet that is rapidly persuing you. Your ship has to travel through each area, making special Faster Than Light jumps between special beacon nodes. When you arrive at a beacon an event will take place, such as a battle, a trade or negotiations, where you choose wheather you will attack the ship, try to hide or even bring an alien crewmember on board. During a battle there's lots to do, which means a lot of work around the ship for your crewmembers (also nameable, although you'll probably get sad when one you named after your friend snuffs it). There are shields, weapons, drones, medbays and a reactor to power them all.  The soundtrack is lovely, as with a lot of indie games. When you enter a battle, the music for the current galaxy gets more intense, and will have you whistling all day long.   The great thing about the gameplay is that it can be paused at any time, even in the middle of a battle, so you can plan your next move. This is a great little aspect of the game, because it makes you feel like everything's happening at once and you have to choose your compromise, because this game is HARD. There are times when you feel like a pro and times when you wish you hadn't provoked the enemy, or wish that you hadn't destroyed a ship while your crew were still on board. A standard game of FTL: Faster Than Light can take about an hour and a half, and no two plays are the same. Give it a go!",

Replayability of the game is high with various ships to unlock, lots of weapons to find, different strategies to try out and of course the random generation of a new galaxy each run.

The gameplay involves you mainly micromanaging your spaceship and crew as you travel through a number of random encounters trying to reach the other side of the map so you can deliver a warning to your rebel headquarters and defeat the final boss.  FTL is a game that relies heavily on it's difficulty, being much shorter than your average rouge-like. You manage a number of fairly limited resources as you slowly improve your ship and crew. You gather fuel, missiles and money and hope for new and better weapons and drones as your crew members gain experience in whatever field they are working.  It is a well made game and one I'm happily recommending but it's also a game that has some rather annoying limitations.  Your ship has very little customization options which makes repeat playthroughs somewhat dull, an unusual trait for a rouge-like. Choosing a different ship often yields much the same gameplay as even though your starting position changes a little, the only real change longterm is the configuration of the various rooms on your ship.  Another problem is the relatively short campaign you will begin to take note of once you've learned the basics and only the unforgiving higher difficulty gives it any sort of longevity.  All in all FTL: Faster Than Light is a nice little game, but it is also a game that needs something more before I'll agree with the underdog hype that seems to be going around everywhere these days. Perhaps strong developer support and a growing modding community will one day make this into the game it could be but as it sits now it is nothing special.",

When you get into a fight, your ship takes localized damage that interferes with your ship's functions in every way. Thus, combat is a game of maintaining your ship and taking out the enemy as quickly as possible to minimize the mayhem they cause. Sometimes your ship will be boarded and you'll have to determine how to kill the enemy crew who are breaking stuff and attacking your own crew while trying to destroy an enemy ship that is likely still shooting you. The game has a million tactical possibilities every playthrough and is wildly popular.  It's cheap, and if you've got enough patience to play a game where the journey is the enjoyment, not the ending, you'll probably like FTL.",

I've only played 7 hours so far, but there's no doubt I'll sink in some more hours so... yeah, it's a good game.  But it's really not as marvellous and great and perfect as some reviews suggest. For one thing, this game does not have 'awesome random events'. The game IS one gigantic random event. There's really nothing you can do that you are SURE will bring in positive or negative outcomes. This total lack of control feels refreshing at times, but it's more frustrating than anything else in my opinion. Some randomness is good, but to me, things get old pretty fast when everything works on a dice roll.  Other than that, the game is pretty hard and unforgiving. Good change of pace, considering the amount of titles that get thrown at our face where actions have no consequences. So don't get too attached to your crew... you'll see them die soon enough.  So... yeah. I like this game. But it's not the game of the century. It got so much praise that I guess I'm just a tad disappointed. Actually, I see it more as a time killer, kind of like Eufloria (yes, I did just compare FTL to Eufloria. Go figure).  But hey, that's just my opinion. Grab it for 2 or 3 bucks on sale and make your own opinion, you probably won't regret it.",

Not to mention that using built-in exploits and leadership skills (read: tag-teaming boarders and fires, or luring said boarders into the med bay and fighting them with heals) can be pretty gratifying. However, I find a large margin of error to be the fact that it's just as fortuitous as, well, real space travel and war... in our present with our technology. Seriously, what kind of faster-than-light spaceship crew doesn't have anything better than a fire extinguisher? Why can't we isolate the cabins to vent oxygen only from the ones that are on fire? What material did they build it from that is so mysteriously flammable? And once you think you've got the timing of the weapons right and everything, and you've fully upgraded your shields and you've got decent weapons and a dependable dodge rating, the flagship puts up a kind of underwhelming fight... at least until suddenly your entire med bay is on fire and your crew drops dead because the system is too damaged for heals while you're still getting battered by the flagship but since all hands are on deck (and dying) to put out the stupid fire then your shields reload as slow as molasses in a vaccum and then you just die. Like you never even spent any time working your butt off to get your ship the best it can be, all those thrilling escapes and chases by the rebel fleet and the times you went six jumps with three hull points left and got to a repair station by the skin of your teeth, like those never even happened. And why? So you can do it all again. Nothing compared to the rush I get when I start off a fresh adventure, but it's agonizing to have to start from the bottom every time, considering this is the only permadeath-upgrade-your-way-unscripted-rpg game that I own or have ever played. No idea why I keep coming back to it, but I do and I can say I'll keep playing until it manages to really ♥♥♥♥ me off, and considering the way I died against the flagship on easy and I've still got the stomach to hit restart, I can't see myself rage-deleting the local content anytime soon.",

In addtion to that replay value, you can get different ships that are unlocked through various methods, which do not necessarily make the game any easier or harder, but rather fit a certain playstyle better.

Well, I did. It was a cold winter sales, Steam made a huge sale on this game, the screenshots didn't promise much but since I'm generally hyped for Sci-Fi ships games I went away and got it. Well, it was cheap, it was indie (I like to support indie developers) so it wouldn't be a total loss. I downloaded the game (pretty small download) and the next few hours of my life were lost in this brilliant masterpiece.  This game is an RTS/RPG mixture in wich you have your own ship and crew with minimalistic graphics, you travel trough space and sometimes you encounter some enemy ships (or you decide to turn hostile on them). You have to controll your crew and the game ends when they die. Pretty easy until here right? Now add up the fact that you have several modules on your ship, upgrades, money, fuel and ammunition. Getting more complex isn't it? Now add up the fact that you are prompted with most of the choices you have to do like, for example, you detect a ship who's requesting help, you go near it and they approach you with a question like: 'We got out of fuel, could you give us some?' and then they prompt you with 2 choices: a) Give them the fuel (and wander if they'll give you something when you reach a safe spot or maybe you're just a good soul); b) Kill them and steal their money and ammunition. All of this and much more, make one of the most fun, innovative and immersive games I've played recently.  Overall: 9/10 Words can't describe this game at all. It's a immersive experience without using pretty graphics. Using it's own originality it conquered a space among most of the AAA games I've played and I don't regret a single penny from what I paid.

This game gives an excellent take on space exploration and is worth it for the entertaining gameplay.  Pros: +Gameplay is not just unique and fun; it successfully gives the feeling of being the captain of your own ship. +Rogue-like with randomly generated games. However, still has a cool and definitive ending that is always reachable if you can pass a certain number of star systems. +Lots of ships to unlock. I have only unlocked like two of them. +Very challenging, and different difficulty levels will fit more 'hardcore' or less 'hardcore' players. +Great soundtrack  Mixed: +/-Games take a long time.  Cons: -There is a luck element, and you can definitely lose a long, hard-earned game off of bad luck. These incidences are decreased with good strategy, but they still happen. -There are a lot of scenarios in the game, but I wish they would add even more.

Small and random scenarios that can help or harm your objective make the game play out differently every time. In a sense, this game harkens to the randomness and permanent deaths of a roguelike title while making no apologies for it's difficulties like the Demon/Dark Souls games do. The main focus revolves around getting from one end of the galaxy to the other to destroying the enemy capitol ship. The gameplay has you managing your ship, crew, and resources while transporting from beacon to beacon on a star map. It's at these beacons that the random scenarios make for some interesting events which often require you to make choices. Part of the allure of this game lay in the fact that few choices reap the same result. For example, answering a distress beacon doesn't always mean there's a friendly group waiting for help. Another part of intrigue lay in the plethora of options at your disposal concerning how you play. When opponents boarded my ship to wreak havoc I would simply send some of my shipmates to deal with them. In time, however, I came to realize that I had the option to strengthen my airlock doors so they couldn't break through them while opening the space airlock doors to suffocate them via a lack of oxygen! It's the little options like these that make for some truly open-ended gameplay. The dynamic soundtrack provides a great collection of science fiction-oriented themes which change according to the circumstances, and the simplistic art style conveys a lighthearted aesthetic which ultimately makes it easier to accept the reality of losing your ship over and over again. The Demon/Dark Souls games are gloriously difficult with a more realistic art style, but it has a save system that can be used after you die. (FTL's art style is appreciated in light of the fact that this game has a permenant death system.) Ultimately, you will get more and more invested in your ship the longer you survive and upgrade it, but I must advise that you should expect to lose your ship from time to time because of the nature of the gameplay. It's mindblowing how such a unique and successful game was born out of a 2-man developement team (technically 3 if you consider the music composer). Kickstarter has it's ups and downs, but this title simply would not have existed apart from it. If I had to rate it on a scale I'd give FTL a 9.5 out of 10.",

The permadeath feature is essential to the constant tension and managing your encounters with different ships and dangers, to the final sector which you have to fight the Rebel mothership which evolves after you beat it in the first place—and not to mention the huge amount of replayability due to diverse randomly generated worlds and scenarios (and the recent updates add tons of additional content, from ship, story, to alien race).  However, as good as a game might be, there's always a room for improvement. Though this game features Cloud Sync, the game save file is NOT compatible cross-OSes (I played on Mac and Windows) which is quite a drawback for people who constantly use different OS on everyday basis. The achievement is saved in your save file too, which means it's not saved on Steam and again—it's not compatible with cross-OS save files.

Otherwise, continue reading.    General Description   In this sci-fi, rogue-like game, you are a ragtag crew of beings aboard a reconditioned ship of your choosing, attempting to relay critical intel to the Federation while the Rebels chase you across a randomly generated galaxy. On the way to Federation HQ, you will encounter strange and somewhat disturbing phenomenon that could mean the prosperity or end of you and your fellow shipmates. It is up to you to decide what is the best course of action as you navigate through this skeptical society torn by war, but you will insure a bright future for all who inhabit the galaxy if you manage to succeed in your mission.    Pregame   Right off the bat, the first things I noticed about the game were the impressive art involved and the superb background music. It is apparent that the developers spent much effort into creating the setting and its characters while keeping simplicity in mind, and the music could not be better matched for the scenarios incorporated. Very space-esque, very attractive.  Let's jump right into it. With almost every game started fresh, there is usually some kind of starting equipment to get you ready for the rest of the game. Now I don't expect to be pampered with the best ship in the fleet, but I didn't expect to get a junker with pee shooters either. The game even tells you so in the description of the ship, and is enforced when the game explicitly recommends playing on easy before being adventurous and trying normal. You do NOT want to go guns blazing on normal until you've got more of a feel for the game, but I'm not here to stop you from that and that's fine. Once you get a hang of things, you'll realize that the first ship is not a junker at all, but that the game is unforgiving for making mistakes. Additionally, other ships can be unlocked by completing certain achievements or by successfully completing special events, with each ship having their own unique attributes.    Gameplay   When you're done picking a ship and customizing your crew, you find yourself in the middle of nowhere with a message box updating you on the situation. After some fiddling with the controls, you discover how to jump to the next nearby beacon in the sector, expending some of your fuel in the process. However, you've neglected to properly allocate the energy supply of your ship and the work of your crew in balance, and find yourself toe to toe with a pirate ship charging its guns up for a first strike. Not the best way to spearhead the mission, but you'll be up to speed in no time with the handy tutorial at the main menu screen... which you're not at right now. Well, somehow you manage to persuade the pirate into sparing both your lives and receive a hefty supply of scrap, missiles, and whatnot.  Which brings me to the save mechanic... not the best way to save a game, but it does prevent cheating your way back from an unfavorable situation, something the game is somewhat dependent on since you will find out later on most beacon encounters are random. You figure that out quickly and wonder why the game doesn't pick up at the last checkpoint (hint: there are no checkpoints). At least this will give you time to check out the tutorial.  The tutorial is pretty simple and gives the basics on how to keep your ship from falling to pieces... not much else to say about that. Afterwards, you jump right back into the frey prepared and confront another enemy at the next beacon.    Combat and Aftermath   Combat takes place in RTS style as you attempt to capture or destroy the enemy ship, all while defending your ship from hostile fire and boarding parties. Strategic advantage can be gained by disrupting specific functions of hostile ships, with the same vulnerabilites applying to your ship, so keeping everything in working condition is generally a good habit to adopt lest you like being a sitting duck. With this in mind, you quickly dispatch your newfound foe and profit from what can be salvaged of the remains.   Weapon variety and distribution is there but not executed well.  Weapon variety and distribution is rather random. Sometimes you'll get the best weapon of the game early on but never actually use it; other times you'll find yourself with an over abundance of pee shooters (which, in retrospect, is probably good to start with, but should be traded in later on). Some weapons have similar names but require different resources as well, which can be somewhat confusing. Luckily, whatever you don't need can be traded in at a shop for extra scrap, which can be used to upgrade the performance of your ship to be better suited in combat, used as currency to purchase resources and equipment, or commited to repairs of your ship after a rather dangerous encounter.  Don't get me wrong, though. Not everything in the game is completely combat. Oftentimes you'll encounter other travelers in need of assistance, come across stray wreckages holding caches of equipment, or accidently stray too close to the stars. It's up to you whether or not you want to participate in these events, but keep in mind that, under normal circumstances, the odds are always stacked against you. That's why Bill didn't make it back to the ship in time.    Summary   In short, FTL provides a plethora of addicting and exciting, new content for players to enjoy, with each playthrough uniquely different from the last. While there are a few disagreeable methods implemented, some are there to prevent the experience from being shattered so the player's attention and enjoyment can truely be fulfilled without interruption.    Pros   - Great Artwork and Sound / Simple story and background - Permadeath feature / Temporary Save - Strategic / Semi-linear gameplay - Randomly generated encounters / galaxies - Player choice heavily emphasized - High replay value    Cons   -  Flawed weapon distribution  - Somewhat misleading difficulty settings - The occasional no-chance-in-hell playthrough   Grade:  9/10  I highly recommend this game.",

The gameplay, the gameplay is fantastic the lasers feel hard hitting, the animations are amazing and the pause system allows you to sit down and think. Not to mention the different combat styles, boarding, hacking, drones, FTL allows you to do what you want to do in combat making it truly breathtaking.  3. The graphics while retro give the game its own feel and it makes the game feel nicer. So, are you convinced yer?",

Gameplay is fairly straightforward: You go from sectors to sectors, and in each you can do something that could further your cause (mostly by staying alive).

Along the way there are many different random encounters, most being some kind of ship-to-ship combat. You find new equipment and crew members to outfit your ship, and eventually you unlock new ships and outfits for ships as you play through the game. A few words of warning however: FTL is crazy-addictive, you'll find yourself playing until sunrise if not careful; also FTL does not have a save/load feature that allows you to turn back time - your decisions matter and a few bad choices will quickly spiral into your ship, crew, and the entire mission being lost.

That said though, this game has a moderate difficulty curve which, if approached badly, will guarantee failure in the long-term.  The game utilises a single-run system, every time you die, you reset back to a base version of a ship. Now I dont mind this system too much, but when you progress fairly far into the game, and are suddenly attacked by a massively overpowered enemy which eventually kills you, it makes you want to go back to change things, but alas, all is lost upon death. And with the upgrading system implemented into the game, this becomes an irritating factor.  Nontheless, this was a game that has been sitting in my steam library for quite some time now, neglected by my overwhelming masses of things i have yet to play (aka, the humble bundle effect), but I really enjoyed the few hours that i've spent on it so far, and I will definately advise other people to give this game a shot, fair warning to the difficulty though.",

It's not the open world space game you might hope for (look to upcoming titles like  Limit Theory,  [ltheory.com]   Wayfarer: The Outer Reaches,  [brightspritegames.com]   No Man's Sky,  [www.no-mans-sky.com]  Elite: Dangerous,  [elite.frontier.co.uk]  or  Star Citizen  [robertsspaceindustries.com]  for those). However, despite that, it manages to pull off an incredibly intense space experience within the constraints it puts itself in.   You're the director of the crew of a ship trying to get from point A to point B while fleeing a pursuing Rebel fleet that has all but destroyed your Federation, yet you carry vital cargo that may somehow turn the tide. It's never entirely clear what that cargo is, as the story plays pretty fast and loose, as you explore some distant reaches of space, fighting pirates, helping other intelligent species as well as being attacked by them, and coming across some fascinating anomalies as you go from beacon to beacon and sector to sector until you make it to the final, eighth sector.   Throughout all this, chances are you will die. A lot. This falls into the roguelike genre that has been popular recently, but with the great difference of being scifi amidst a bunch of more fantasy style games. Albeit, if you'd like more scifi roguelikes you may look into  Bionic Dues  [arcengames.com]  for another recent scifi entry into the genre (unfortunately minus the space, but fortunately  with  the mechs!).  That being said, that factor alone makes it well worth purchasing in my opinion (though preferably from GOG or Humble Store), but even more than that is that with the recent introduction of Advanced Edition content, the game has only gotten even better than before. Toss in mods and the fun stories you'll get from close scrapes with death from various playthroughs, and you have countless hours of fun, many of my own not counted here from playing the DRM-free version more on the side.   Ask yourself, do you want to be able to have the virtual experience of suffocating would-be pirates or saboteaurs teleporting aboard your ship? Do you want to be saved by your enemy trying to hack an already destroyed subsystem incidentally shutting the doors to it, restoring oxygen in the rooms and allowing you to do repairs after you fend it off? Then you want FTL. Other space games may let you command fleets, but few let you manage the frantic internal affairs of the crew trying to hold everything together.",

Flak weapons are stupidly good.   Never use the 3rd-tier weapon, they aren't as power-efficient as the second ones for the shots you get.   Never put a zoltan in piloting, sensors, or doors.

Along with the standard choice box (Oh hey, do the thing this way, or do it this way, and see what happens), the in game choices you make in battle are equally as important. That ship you just destroyed gave you lots of materials, but was it worth taking that missile to the face? Along with that, the scenarios are well written and give you a sense of urge to take risks! Or not. With a boat load of ships to command, a whole crowd of races with different advantages and disadvantages, a multitude of weapons and drones to arm yourself to the teeth with, it's up to you to make the right choices as a captain to get you and your crew to the end. And with increasing difficulty modes, that end goal just became MUCH harder to achieve. It does have it's flaws, though. The backgrounds and art, while beautiful, are stagnant. This dulls the game a bit in an aspect. While the great planet is behind you, it all feels dead. Having randomly generated maps feels nice, but apart from stars too close for comfort, colorful planets, and eerie nebulas, the whole game can feel very repetitive. This is a bit of an issiue when you play through it a lot. Things become a blur of clicking and you don't feel like you are immersed in the game anymore. Combat is interesting, but it's a bit slow to start. All in all, I would recommend this game to anyone specifically interested in what it is, a ship based combat RPG.",

In the game, the player controls the crew of a single spacecraft, holding critical information to be delivered to an allied fleet several sectors away, while being pursued by a large rebel fleet.   The player must guide the spacecraft over a number of sectors, each with planetary systems and events procedurally generated in a roguelike fashion, while facing against rebel and other hostile forces, recruiting new crew, and outfitting and upgrading their ship. Combat takes place in pausable real time, and if the ship is destroyed or the crew lost, the game ends in permadeath, requiring the player to restart.  +Great soundtrack. +Very challenging. +Endlessly replayable. +Immersive and fun.  -Events start to repeat themselves after many playthroughs.",

High replayability if you enjoy the 'roguelite' genre of procedural maps and randomised spawns, a wide variety of starting 'character' setups, and character advancement during an individual session.  Cons: The AI you face in every combat is acting randomly - there is no tactical play from the enemy, so you're sometimes up against foes which could cripple you in a single barrage, but fail to do so. If you want an evenly-matched tactical fight, rather than combat where you use tactics against RNG, look elsewhere. If Roguelites are not your thing, this will not be your game.",

In this game, by default, you control the space ship, the USS Kestrel, though other styles of ships are unlockable. You can rename your ship and the three crew members you get. Your ship has multiple systems that you must manage, such as Oxygen, Weapons, and Shields. You have to run away from the rebel fleet across eight sectors, all the while fighting other ships, trading with people visiting stores, and making decisions. The best part abouth the decisions is that there is always a possibility of a postive or negative outcome. Depending on the type of situation that you are in, you decide whether or not to try that decision. Theoretically, the game shouldn't take more than two three hours to beat, you'll die and restart so much, the game's lenght will probably triple. The game has a very nice pixelated art style that I love (hinting at the origins of my name) and the price is very cheap considering the quality of the game.

What do you do when your enemy disables your shield and then beams its crew onboard to wreak more havoc? Do you reroute power to your engines to increase your ship's evasion or power up the medbay to fend off the pesky intruders? What impresses me most about FTL is that it caters to a million different play styles. There are nine playable ships (eight of which must be unlocked), each with two different layouts. The game will do everything in its power to crush you, asphyxiate you, set your entire ship on fire until that fateful moment when your hull (HP) reaches zero and your journey ends. You'll laugh and you'll cry (mostly cry), but you'll always come back for more. FTL does a great job with the visuals (combining retro and modern themes while avoiding clichés) and the soundtrack is simply amazing. Definitely worth whatever they're charging for it nowadays.",

I've been destroyed and failed worse than a wins to losses ratio on League of Legends (generally double or even triple the losses to wins) because this game is simply stupid with the stress it puts on me to be perfect and still understand the odds are against me while I am screwed because of the little things. I will be honest. It needs fixing. Intense fixing. Maybe I'm still angry from playing it earlier but it causes so much anger, hate and disdain that this game is worth an update or two for some balancing. I cant understand why the first jump lands me on a Sun with an enemiy using weapons that I am doomed to fight against. Its so hard to say I like this game enough to keep playing it but its true. It wouldnt hurt to have some balanced out changes to the meaning of NORMAL in this. Normal shouldnt mean I lose within five minutes of playing. And no thats not just bad luck. It is that this game needs some balamce help. Normal shouldnt mean enemies are better equipped than me within the first   However. That angry and unhappy and unfair part aside. In love with this.

FTL is a mix of roguelike-alike and chaos management, in space, aboard a fragile ship that looks remarkably like the previous n million that were sent to their doom in some horrible, regrettable fashion. You'll love it regardless - you're saving the galaxy, fighting the rebel scum, as you plot a galactic (escape) course to ultimate (unlikely) victory... you'll love it right up until it's fiery gibs explode and float off to join the growing debris of your many failures.  Depth of mechanics and instant high replayability make FTL a winner. There's no doubt lots of successful strategies, but appropriately for the genre, uncovering them is both challenging and fun. Even when you're screaming.",

You are taking a spaceship through the galaxy to reach the end point. Throughout your travels you will encounter rebels and space fleets that you will have to co-operate or destroy. One by one, those spaceships will appear and will become more of a challange to handle. You will need to think. A lot. What weapons to use? Where to deploy the personel? Where to aim? What to upgrade? and so on Tactics is everything and with good investments in shields or weapons you will be able to make it far. Invest too soon and you might won't be able to beat that rebel cruiser that awaits you at the end of the sector. Invest too late and your ship won't stand the next encounter with nebula.  Absolutely love this game, but truth to be said: ITS HARD! I have yet to beat this game - but for some reason I don't mind. I get incredibly frustrated when I fail, but I imediately start over.

You can lose from lack of skill, but you cannot win from skill. I have repeatedly lost on the final boss because I never got good weapons all the way through the game. Due to the way the shield system works, it is really helpful to have lasers that fire lots of shots. On one playthrough, I got a bunch of these and just totally dominated everything. On many other playthroughs, I didn't and lost.   In general, the weapons are really imbalanced, in large part because all of the missle and bomb weapons require missles, which are in short supply, so you can't use very many missle weapons. This forces you to use laser weapons most of the time. However, once you start using laser weapons, you probably want to jettison missle weapons because laser and missle weapons don't have great synergy (although there are ways to make it work), Most of the weapons are worthless and it's annoying to find stores in the game thathave three terrible weapons for sale. I think I will look for cheats that will give me higher odds of getting useful weapons and completely remove the terrible weapons.  In spite of these issues, I think it's a fun game and would recommend trying it out. But wait for a sale.",

Pros: -Roguelike game where you are a space captain. -Zomg look up. Space captain. SPAAAAAAACE -Okay seriously, this game is all about exploration, luck, and micromanaging crew members, weapon systems, and remembering when to use drones. And when to open all the hatches and put out fires. Cause fires hurt. -No two games are alike, as per it being a roguelike and all. -Free DLC expansion that adds a mountain of content. -Did I mention SPAAAAAAACE  Cons: -Difficulty can go from super easy to insanely hard with no warning -Random events can sometimes be a bit harsh, but thats really more of previous con. -Only one save file (so if you share computer with someone else and they feel like playing kiss your latest attempt goodbye)  This game has been a wonderful evil overlord of my time off and on. Each run I try, I almost beat the game only to stumble on a stupid random encounter that murders vital crew or spawns a ship thats 'just' a bit rougher than my ship loadout can muster. More than once I've managed to defeat a very powerful foe only to have 1-3 hp left on my ship and found myself toe to toe with yet another scarey foe... LOADING PLEASE WAIT.  While the game itself isn't 'funny' you will find yourself chuckling while you slowly suffocate space pirates using nothing but 4 ion cannons and disabling their ship so they helplessly look out the airlock.  If you enjoy roguelikes and the idea of starring in your own VERY violent show of 'Star Trek', this game is for you. If you don't, then go move along to something else... but buy this for a friend first.  I know I did.",

I want to clear all the sectors. I want to get all the upgrades. I want to take care of my crew and get them fully trained. Tough, says FTL. You have to make some very hard decisions. You have very little time. Bad things are going to happen to you. They're largely arbitary. You're going to have to asphysixiate your crew at least once.  It's very hard. It's very fun. The random number generator is not kind to you. You will probably die quite a lot. You will experience the ecstacy of having a rig that just chews through enemies and the agony of when the thing you were praying didn't happen happens and your (nearly) perfect ship goes up in flames.",

On one hand, it's a brilliantly designed semi-strategy roguelike game where you take control of a spacecaft and it's crew. You'll visit star systems, fight enemy spacecraft, upgrade your ship, and make little 'do you help this person or that person' kind of decisions. The music is FANTASTIC and the learning curve is very mild. The storyline is very simple, but it gives reason to the way the game plays, why you have to be picky in what systems you visit, and such. And the game gives me the vibe that the designers didn't want to make a best-seller: They just wanted to make a fun game, regardless of profit margins.  On the other hand, it's a roguelike, which means that you'll suddenly be completely overwhelmed by enemies and lose. And it's not one of those losses where you think 'maybe if I did this differently..' No, you just get completely blown away with no chance of escape. And I swear this game 'cheats'...I'll be attacking some lowly enemy craft and my maximum experience gunner will miss with a missile. Then another. Then another. Meanwhile, the enemy shoots my ship twice with a junk weapon and blows two holes in the hull.  A friend used a cheat and gave himself a ship hull that could take unlimited damage and maximum money (called 'scrap'). He still lost because the game found some other way to overpower his ship and crew. I've come close to beating it, but only by a thread.  Yes, this game makes me want to break my keyboard in half. Then I'll have to buy another because I'll want to play again a few hours later.  ",

The game plays in a quasi-turn based fashion. You chose the weapon you want to fire and where to aim it but they have to charge up a few seconds before you can fire. If things get too hectic you can also pause the game to think through your next few moves. As your fight through each sector you can get more crew members, upgrade your arsenal and make lots of “moral” choices to try your luck at getting a nice bonus. Though it sounds like there is a ton of content (and there is) I still found things getting a little repetitive after countless playthroughs.

This game likes to play with that boundry. - Casual game  Casual is pretty subjective but I consider this game casual since I tend to play it for a couple hours whenever I'm just feeling the mood for it. It isn't one of the games I dump six hours into at a time just a couple here and there.  Cons: - Death  There will be death - Chance is a REAL thing  Ctrl + C =&gt; Ctrl + P from earlier. - Not enough writing for the events  I put this in here because after playing round after round you begin to stop reading the scripts and looking for keywords in the paragraphs and making a decision based on that.

You're a Federation ship with vital information on the Rebel Flagship and its fleet, which you're running from. The objective of the game is to reach the 8th sector (the last Federation fort), then dig your heels and attack the Flagship head-on to defend the Fed base and defeat the Rebels. You'll warp across several sectors belonging to different races and factions - you can run into energy beings, slavers, pirates, more Rebels, rock men, slugs, giant alien spiders (stay away from those. No, seriously) and so on. Most of which you'll have to fight off, some of which you'll help, and all the time you'll have to improve your crew and your ship so it doesn't explode.   Here's a pretty good summary from Zero Punctuation.     'But I don't like RTS games!'  Neither do I, mostly. But the pause function makes this much more enjoyable - you can stop, look at everything, give orders, and power/depower systems as necessary. Far less stressful than having to watch an entire goddarn battlefield at once, right? Speaking of which, you don't have to watch an entire battlefield - just your ship and the enemy's, each with its systems and crew and weaponry - and on occasion a space hazard. Seriously, just look at the trailer. Simpler than most RTS games.   'Just how hard is this game? Plenty of other reviews say you'll die a lot.'  This being heavily 'roguelike-like', your ship WILL explode more often than not - it's a tough game even on Easy. That said, you can still unlock every ship on that difficulty without the game mocking you. Which I almost have.   'What is this 'Advanced Edition'? Do I have to pay for it?'  I'll answer the second question first: No! It's totally free, both for people who already had it and people that haven't bought it 'till after it got released. As to what it  is , it's basically additional content - a new race called the Lanius, new ships (both for the Lanius and some extra variants of the other ships), new weapons and systems, and more random events. It can be toggled manually in-game - if you get this game, I suggest you do your first 5 or so playthroughs with it off, so there's less stuff to learn in one go.   'How do you unlock stuff in the game?'  The first ship, the Kestrel, is free. It's a pretty good ship, with a decent layout and good starting weapons. The Engi ship is unlocked by reaching Sector 5, which is relatively easy to do - and it's horribly easy to use. The Federation Artillery ship is unlocked by beating the game, if I recall. Other ships are unlocked via certain events, some of which are more convoluted and circumstantial than others. And then you have reskins. The B variants require you two beat two of the three ship-specific achievements for the same class of ship, and the C variants (which are Advanced Edition-exclusive) require you to reach Sector 8 with the B variant of said ship class.",

The dynamics of the game are quite complex, and it seems that in the later portions of the game, the difficulty gets ramped up so much that it's nigh-impossible to beat--even on easy mode. I tried following the advice of others, and while I did learn quite a bit, their suggestions never really suited my gameplay style. I was able to make it to the Big Bad Evil Guy in the end several times, but I usually got trounced during the first two forms of it, thus making the final form impossible. So, I played focusing more on understanding the game and unlocking ships. I find myself enjoying the Stealth ships innate ability to cloak--dodging is so satisfying. But there I was, adrenaline pumping through my system, my hull bar still in the green at the end with advanced content disabled. When I cloaked and dodge all 9 of the plasma laser shots during the power surge, I knew how it would end. When I finally delivered the coup de grace--in truth it was a drone, not my own shot--I nearly shouted with glee in my hotel. I had finally ♥♥♥♥ing done it, the game was beginning to make sense--20 hours in.  It's a true rogue-like. It's hard, but fair. You'll get slaughtered, you'll get pummeled, you'll be burned to a crisp. But try to learn from each death.

SO  FTL .. it's not the perfect game.  I tried it on a whim, and I really don't regret it. If you park the retro graphics to one side, it's an interesting and addictive game.

You're on the run from a massive enemy fleet, and there's every likelihood you will die.  (probably in an inglorious way)  Even so, it's a good, fun game. When you get everything right - a good crew, balanced systems, good strategy, you really feel like you're on a space adventure.

            "review_text": "I could give you an actual review of the game with reasoning behind why I like it so much, but instead I think I'll let you read through the story of one of my playthroughs and see for yourself.   Once upon a time, there was a ship, appropriately titled 'The Loser.' The Loser really sucked at doing just about anything, but was given an extremely important mission for the Federation nonetheless, as the bureaucrats at the top wanted to save money. They were to go to the far end of the galaxy and stop the evil rebel armada. Among The Loser's grand crew was the captain, Lousy, who made the worst decisions possible. There was also Stupid, an Engi, who did nothing except what Lousy told him too, and then managed to mess everything up anyway. He liked to play in fire. Then there was his brother, Fred, the engineer. Fred was the only person who didn't suck at his job.  Moments after leaving the station, The Loser encountered a rebel ship, armed to the teeth with heavy weaponry. Lousy, being the lousy captain he was, decided to attack the ship. After a quick three minutes of 'battling' (devoting all time to hull breach repairs and attempting to put out fires) Lousy ran away from the battle, jumping into warp, and, despite the ship still being on fire, decided to answer a distress call form a nearby space station. The station was being attacked by giant spiders, so Lousy happily sent in his battered crew to take care of them. However, it turned out that Giant Spiders were, well, giant. Running and screaming for their lives, the crew almost made it to their ship, though Fred did take the opportunity to distract the giant spiders by throwing Lousy to be feasted upon by them. Lousy died as he lived: screaming and running from a bad decision he made.  Now alone, Stupid took it upon himself to claim the position of captain, much to Fred's dismay. Despite having taken heavy damage, Stupid opted not to go into a store for repairs, and instead went inside a giant nebula, whereupon they were taken by surprise by slavers. The slavers demanded one of their crewman as a slave, and, though Stupid clearly wanted to fight their 10x bigger ship, Fred was more than happy to offer up Stupid as a slave. Stupid initially refused, but, upon being told there was candy on the slave ship, eagerly agreed. Fred never saw Stupid again.  Happy with the new peace and quiet, Fred took the opportunity to make some smart decisions. He flew the ship into a store and had it repaired. Realizing he had no money left, Fred took the nearby planets, asking if anybody needed some mercenary work done. One small group asked them to destroy a rebel scout that had been harassing a space station nearby. Though he was initially going to deny the job, remembering how well their last Rebel encounter had went, the pay was too good. He made it to the outpost and, though careful strategy and manipulation of ion blasters and drones, managed to take out the enemy ship. He then immediately spent all his money on a scrap recovery arm, thinking it would be a great long-term investment.  Feeling good about himself, he took up a couple of other jobs that were fairly easy, and accumulated many resources. Realizing he had to make it to the next system before it was too late, he decided that he's done enough mercenary work for now, and flew full-speed to the next system, just before the rebels took over the one he left. Choosing between a Mantis-controlled system and a Mantis-controlled system, he chose the Mantis-controlled system. Stopping at a store, he considered buying a cloning chamber, but then shuddered at the thought of more Lousys and Stupids running around and opted just to get fuel. All was quiet for a while, Halfway across the system he found an abandoned rebel ship and stripped it of resources. He fought off a rebel scout quite easily, and, on a whim, decided to check out a distress signal from another space station. Their message came through; they'd also been overrun by giant spiders. Immediately Fred turned tail and left. There was no way he was going down the same way as the not-dearly departed Lousy.  As he left, he suddenly read a signal on his console; there was an intruder on deck! Arming himself with a laser, he cautiously made his way out into the main hallway, where he found a mantis begging for sanctuary from a pirate ship that he had just escaped from. Moments later, the pirate ship itself appeared, offering up a bounty for the Mantis's return. Fred contemplated, and realized that, while it would be smarter to return the Mantis, he WAS getting rather lonely, and imaginary friends could only do for so long. Besides, he had been able to handle every ship thus far with a few simple strategies. He responded by firing upon the pirate ship.  But it was a trap! The Mantis tore out his shields, leaving him unshielded and crippled before teleporting back onto the ship. Several drones came out of the pirate ship, protecting it from anything Fred launched. Fred immediately threw his own drones at them in hope of doing some damage, but they were reduced to scrap heaps in seconds. With his back against the wall, Fred decided that he had no choice but to get out of there, desperately firing Ion charges at their weapons while he powered up his engines. But they had too many weapons. Lasers cut across the deck; numerous hull breaches broke out on the other side of the ship, and fires were lit near the oxygen system! He couldn't fix that now; he just kept powering the ship's engines, hoping to get away in time. The oxygen system broke, and slowly the air grew thinner. It became nearly impossible to breathe. Still, Fred worked. Eventually, he was able to launch warp speed, and get out of there! The Loser came to rest in the middle of empty space, and Fred ran through various systems to repair the oxygen. Eventually, he did, but by then it was too late to repair the hull breaches. Oxygen was seeping out at a faster rate than ever. Desperate, he went locked himself in the Medbay, where he spent his last few seconds wondering how things might have turned out differently if he had jettisoned an escape pod instead of running around screaming.  The rebels won.  10/10. I love this game.",

            "review_text": "I give it 8/10 Don't get fooled, it is a must-have. Recommended price cap: $5.   CONS:  -I only wish game had a stronger direction: better story with maybe small cinematics, a rpg aspect to the game for your characters and a multiplayer.   PROS: 1) It's a space game with team management and it is fast paced.   2) It' s a mix between a survival and a submarine game. Survival because either pirates ships disguised in traders, alien bordings, solar eruptions, ionic disrupted Nebulas, fire, lack of oxygen, shield, or power can get you killed.  Submarine because each room of the ship can be managed an each of them play their unique role.   3) It has a huuuuuge replayability, you never get bored. There are some many guenine different ways to end the game.  Do you want to specialize in automatic tools like drones? Or maybe you prefer mind controling opponents crew, or hacking their ship, or both? Or using a big ♥♥♥ batttery of (hull cutting lasers), or EMP, or laser cutting, incendiary missiles, send scrap to their shield? Or bord their ship with your alien crew members who get rid of the oxygen around them? The list goes on i don't have as much imgination as the game does....  4) The CHALLENGE, despite handling easiness.  5) The music is awesome, it sets you deep into your ship's soft sofa.  Just watch others steam reviewer's time spent on it; there's a reason why they spent 40 hours on average for a game that could be ended in 1.",

I played it for a few hours, then put it down for a couple years. When I finally decided to invest the time, I found a rewarding game of surprising depth.  Each play is different, even with the same ship. Sure, there are modules you always want to have for the final boss, leading to similar tactics for that specific fight, but the interesting part (for me) was balancing progression strategy (getting to the final boss) with preparation for the final boss, itself. These are often conflicting goals, since a ship built for progression might not be any good at all for the final battle. I think that dynamic, right there, is what makes this game so intriguing to me.  It's not for everyone, though. If you just want to play a casual spaceship simulator, this will leave you unsatisfied. If you want to play 'savior of the galaxy, against all odds', look no further.",

Let me tell you, that's not easy.  You start off with 1 ship. With it's own loudout, that's the same every time. To get more loadouts and more ships, you have to do certain challenges and quests, respectively. You can send your crew into different rooms to operate different things. You power up your FTL drive and warp to the next planet. Every planet has a different event. A store, a stray rebel, a pirate, a slaver, a ship in need, a quest. Any of these events are possible. Your choices don't really effect you story wise (as there's not that great of a story) but every decision you make can positively or negatively impact your ship. You might gain a crew member, some scrap (The game's currency), damage to your hull, etc etc. Take too long in any one sector and the rebel fleet will have caught up with you. There are hostile sectors, full of enemies with better ships but better loot, friendly sectors, full of random events that will most likely benefit you, and nebulas, full of, well, nebulas.   With all this I gotta say I LOVE this game. It's a lot of fun to play, probably on of my favorite indie games, Next to Terraria and Fez. I have only a few complaints.  1) THIS GAME IS SO FRUSTRATING. Sometimes you'll encounter a lot of bad things and you'll end up dying and be like WTF I had so much good stuff that run. 2) The Flagship. The flagship fight is like no other fight. Once you get to it's sector you have 6 turns to attack it or you lose. Which is fine. Here's the problem. It's extremely difficult. Every single fight up until now has been cake, for the most part. Nothing prepares you for this. You basically have to be able to go through 3 hostile sectors in a row and take no damage to be able to take on the Flagship, assuming you even make it there. THEN, if you can survive the Flagship's onslaught of doom and destruction and destroy it, you're not done yet. There's s SECOND part of the battle. Let's be clear. I've done about a hundred or so runs. I've made it to the flagship about 20-40 times. I've beaten part 1 about 15 times. I've beaten part 2 twice.  This game is sucks.  And I love it.

I can almost guarantee you'll love it just as much as I do. The combat gives a rush of adrenaline that I haven't felt since dark souls, yet it's not as easy to die if you keep your wits about you. And even when you die, it never seems or is unfair. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A HEAVY/ITRICATE PLOT, YOU WILL NOT BE SATISFIED IN THAT ASPECT, BUT EVERY OTHER ASPECT IS AMAZING. Characters have no depth except for names and certain skills, but you still feel the heavy loss every time you lose a crew member.

With everything randomized from shop locations to loot to encounters, reliably getting enough money for upgrades, crew and equipment is near impossible.  Easy mode is the equivalent of hard mode on comparable games, and normal is for masochistic people.  You have to perfectly know and manage every single aspect of exploration, timing, gear, upgrades, crew and battle from the get-go even on ''easy'' mode to stand any sort of chance against the enemy, not to mention the highly overpowered final boss.  The tutorial is shallow and insubstantial, teaching you only the bare basics and nothing else, leaving the bulk of mechanics and strategies for you to die over and google.  You can easily get to the final zone of this game in 30 minutes, wich will have the final boss catching you completely off-guard and unprepared.  The problems above are made even worse because said final boss is a good 2-3X bigger and stronger then the hardest enemy in the game and utilises pretty much every single game mechanic to hand you your ♥♥♥.  Basically, for you to win the game on ''Easy'' mode;  - The stars have to allign in your favour as to grant you enough favorable encounters for sufficient money to be able to buy the upgrades/crew/equipment needed to survive&amp;kill the enemies&amp;final boss.  - You need to know&amp;understand all game mechanics and flawlessly time&amp;coördinate everything you do.  Granted, if you do pull all of this off i imagine it's the best feeling ever, but the hassle involved just isn't worth it to me.  What was that you said? winning on normal mode? Pfffthahahaha no.  To conclude this all, i'm going to ask you a single question. Does this sound like fun or a hassle to you?  Don't bother buying this game if it's the latter.",

The whole goal of the game is to outrun, or stay ahead of, the rebel fleet. Nothing else. You're given almost no time to take side trips to develop your crew or ship because if you do the rebel fleet catches up to you and you are dead. But if you race to the end you are too weak to beat the rebel flagship, which is THE end of the game.  Great idea for a game. Too limited in scope.",

The game will constantly put you in impossible situations that can bring your playthrough to a bitter end.  Even easy mode feels impossible, but for what its worth its not a terrible game and I know i'm in the minority when I say I'm not too crazy about it though I love its soundtrack. The game definitely has a charm to it which keeps me coming back occasionally like some sort of masochist.  Expect to die in many unfair ways.

Essentially, how the plot goes, the rebels are threatening to overthrow the federation, and you, as a federation officer, stole some vital information depecting how to defeat the rebels. The rebels learned of this however, and have sent their entire fleet after you. So you, in a manner of speaking, have to jet your ♥♥♥ out of there and back to the federation as fast as possible.  That's where this game starts. You are tasked with getting all the way to sector 8, the federation home base. On your way, you will encounter events, similar to the old oregon trail style. Some of them will be helpful, some of them will hurt, some of them will force you fight enemy ships.... a lot of them will force you to fight enemy ships...  The combat in FTL is similar to a strategy puzzle than an actual dogfight. You have weapons, shields, and evasion. Along with a variety of other weapons and utility devices. The basics of combat are simple... wait for your weapon to charge up and then fire it at the enemy. Depending on the weapon, it will do a certain amount of damage to the enemy ship to reduce it's hull (hp). When the hull reaches zero, the ship blows up.  What makes this game so great, however, is that there are a wide variety of weapons and tools you can use to help destroy, or defeat enemy ships.   Among those strategies, you can: blow the ship up, force it to surrender, set fire to the entire ship, suffocate them all, send a robot to kill everyone on board, or many other infamous methods. (My personal favorite is creating a hull breach in their oxygen room)   Along with the randomness and wide variety of combinations, this game is different and the same in almost every playthrough. Expect to die a lot when you are first learning this game.  The goal is clear, how you adapt and go about it is up to you.",

Now for those of you who actually want to read WHY i think this is a bad game: carry on! This game does a lot of things right, such as: A phenominal soundtrack An orignal(ish) Idea Varying Gameplay And it's fun to play!  'These all sound great, so why did you downvote this game?'  Well, I think the game is fun, just very poorly executed, and i will explain:  1. This game is very luck reliant: It's very hard to win this game, and that by itself is fin, it's a permadeath rogue-like. However, whether you win or lose doesn't have much to do with skill. If you get lucky by finding good items in shop, then you basically get a free win. And there are only a few builds that can actually WIN the game, so the build you may enjoy using could be LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO WIN WITH. And that doesn't seem fun or fair. I think if you're using a really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ build it should be significantly HARDER to win, but not downright impossible. And that pisses me off.  2. Not really a sense of progression: The only real progression you get, aside from random encounters and making so far in the game, is to beat the flagship, and let me tell you, that ♥♥♥♥ is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ near impossible, as previously stated. So it seems like you're losing over and over without any progress, and life feels pointless and everyone has a bad time.  Honestly, it's a pretty solid game, but the fact that it's literally IMPOSSIBLE to win unless certain cirumstances happen, It's no longer a game, it's a gamble. It's no longer up to skill, but luck. And i don't want to gamble everytime i play, i want to learn and use my knowledge to win the game. And with FTL, I just can't do that.  Play at your own risk.  ",

As for gameplay, nice and simple, only plus it has in my opinion as its heavily let down by how reliant this pile of horse ♥♥♥♥♥ is on luck and chance, skill counts for NOTHING in this, it doesnt matter whether your any good at this, the only thing that does matter is that you play the game how it wants you to, and it locks away the ships with a GOOD chance of winning behind pretty stupid things, such as 'this ship is apparently hidden away in the rebel stronghold' guess the ♥♥♥♥ what?  ive spent 15 HOURS and probably more looking and getting good enough for that ONE battle so i could get that ONE ship so i could enjoy the god damn game, instead i never even find the sector until the last time i played, where i had the good fortune to get ♥♥♥♥ed over royally, some people may enjoy this masochistic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but i dont, and i dont see why any sane person would tolerate this crap.  Also as a side note, if you try to alter the game in any way and you dont know what your doing or alter even a single value, the game will immidiately refuse to run, and you will have to delete everything (including your save), and youll lose your progress.  Would i recommend? if you enjoy being kicked between the legs for 39+ hours yup, if you have any common sense? nope. i regret buying this and would love a refund so i could spend money on something developed by people who deserve my money.",

            "review_text": "This review is going to go against the grain... but it's my honest opinion here.  This game is a 2-d, Top-Down resource management game, that gives you variable resources, sporadic choices, and a forced up-tempo on-rails-like experience.  By itself, the game system is not all that hard to figure out. You get scrap, which is your main currency, to buy crew, supplies (like missles), and upgrades to your ship. You then fly from star to star fighting for or chancing upon more scrap and the occasional item or crewmate addition. You are forced to keep moving forward by a 'Fleet' chasing after you, so there's a constant pressure to not get caught by them. If you do, you're almost guaranteed serious damage to your ship or a game over.  So what's the problem then? Its the difficulty. Which has nothing to do with strats or skill. Its comes from the randomness.  Random encounters. Random events. Random upgrades. Random sector maps. Random... just about everything. You can have the best strats in the world, but if you don't get the breaks you need in bumping into the 'right' stuff, you WILL fail. Every time. In fact, failure is a lauded feature by the more zealous players of this game.  Also the final boss... it's the 'Rebel Flagship'... and must seriously be a troll move by the developer. You can have the perfect ship, with all the stuff that can wreck any other ship you encounter in the game... and just about beat it... when all the sudden it supercharges its remaining weapons and wrecks your ship. Super frustrating.  Lastly... the graphics look like something from a 90's PC game (think Ultima VI). I guess that adds charm for some. To me, it seems dated.  I guess one real positive from having low graphics is that the game has little to no loadtimes or overhead for interface speedbumps. Its all pretty much point and click, and is a fast play.  So if you like bashing your head on your desk every couple hours in abject frustration... play some FTL.",

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.",

Put it this way, in business and other things dealing with money the concept of risk vs reward is very prevalent. This game is no exception to the rule, much as it thinks it is. Now for the purposes of this review let's say that reward is in fun rather than monetary gain. For the average person risk should be relatively low for not having fun. In this game the risk is rather high, especially after a certain point where it's pretty much impossible to unlock new stuff (for me it's the point where I'm at). Compound onto this with the fact that it's nigh on impossible to hit an enemy in the late game for some reason, which would be fine if they didn't have THREE layers of shield, which means that they will eat your health with ease while you sit their wishing you could have a jettison option for the person you have manning weapons. At least in that case your jettisoned person might hit the shield and take a level or two off depending on their velocity. I enjoyed the game initially, but my goodwill and enjoyment towards the game has dried up like a sponge in the sahara. Until they update the game to nerf the dodge mechanic this game is pretty much unbeatable, and doesn't get my reccomendation.",

Unfortunately, it will always be a terrible game. Why are you in space? Who's the enemy? Who are you? That energy field chasing me on the map, what is it and why can't it touch me? For a game that prides itself on deep replayability, the universe is never adequately explained in game.  So it's obviously aesthetically wanting, the 'story' is wanting, and we're left with 'is it fun?'. This is a personal question, but for me it is a resounding 'no'. The initial 'strategy' is simple, but can't scale up to harder enemies: take out shields, then weapons, then powerplant. You better get some good weapons, but where?

Even the ancient 'Wing Commander' had voice acting in-game. -'No skill, all chance' is what runs things. There is no strategizing outside of your own weapons array because the random events can go in any direction. -Utterly Random events that kill your crew members with all the grace of Oregon Trail, with no involvement from you other than 'which choice did you pick.'

All I found was frustration in trying to figure out weapons combinations and the uses of secondary systems, and if you're lucky enough to get to the 'endgame' you're more likely to hit the lottery than win. When you find yourself with 1 crew member left halfway through the game because you got randomly ambushed with no time to respond, you don't even want to bother finishing that run, nor do you want to start over.

Despite only 1 final boss, the replay value is unmatched.

There are a huge variety of upgrades, events, weapons and enemies for you to encounter along your journey. The final boss battle is very dificult but like every final boss, once you learn his attacks and weapons you find a build and strategy that works with it. This game does require a lot of strategy and forward planning, for example if you run out of fuel in the first sector, you can end up fighting enemies much too hard for your level and the game can come to an abrupt end. The game can be cruel and unforgiving and if you mess up it will punish you for it... and one thing to remember while playing this is. Never. Underestimate. Your. Enemy. Its important you never forget that, I have been killed by an automated drone (one of the weakest enemies in the game) and when it used other drones to board me and take out my shield it just killed my entire crew with a fire bomb. Overall I would give this game about an 8.4/10 The reason this game didn't get say a 9 or a 10 is because. - Once you have played this game and completed it lets say twice, you basically master the game and it becomes repetetive because you're pretty much unkillable.

Tried of being on a spoonfed linear path where no matter what you do you have the same experience, then this may be your answer. It makes you feel as if you really trying to command a space ship, the randomness can be punishing but it makes it feel fresh and that there is not just a single winning strategy. It may be real time, but it is real time with a good proper pause feature that can make it dynamic turn based. You can pause whenever you like and it has the feel of long spaceship combat not massive micromanagement.",

Cons: Lacks any story until the end of the game May need updates in future so that they could add more things to buy from the shop and to upgrade your ship.  Conclusion: Very good game a must buy for any intermediate gamer system requirements are low so if you can't run it you probably won't be able to run any other games.  Rating: 9/10",

            "review_text": "OVERALL: 8/10  I usually don't like Indie games. Cheap games like this usually suck. However, this was a real gem of a game to find. I got it on sale for around $2, but after playing it would have gladly paid the full price.   The concept of the game is amazing. Pure fun. Starship combat, with different weapons, subsystems etc. Your crew levels up in particular skills (shields, piloting, etc), over time, making you want to keep them. You can attack your enemies head on. With drones. Teleport boarding parties to kick some butt. Or just run away. You can then target each of your enemy subsyetsms for greater effect. They are shooting at you too much? Target their weapons. They threaten to get away? Target their engines! The possibilities are dammed near limitless.  Each game play is completely different. New things happen and the maps and events change with each play. While this is overall a good thing and helps replayability it's also a big weakness. The randomnisation can really tax the fun. A crew member may die randomly after popping into a new section (a wild disease has gotten loose on your ship etc). You may come across the giant ship of mega death that can outgun you and blow you up very quick. etc etc. The difficulty level is up there too....after 12 hours on easy, I still can't beat this game. I've made it to the final boss a few times, but I've gotten creamed every time.  Is it fun? Yes. Can it suck due to RNG occasionally? Absolutely. Will you have find and lose track of time? Yep. Should you buy it? Without question.",

First off, it's roguelike - crazy hard, ramdomly generated, permadeath, odds heavily against you. Even easy setting will find you blown up numerous times, especially while you're learning the basics. The graphics are pretty basic but they get the job done. The music provides a good space ambience. The replay potential is great since there are a number of ships and layouts to unlock and achievement or challenges to accompllish. The fun of this game comes when you get through the hard learning curve. Once you get the basics down, you'll understand what to do in most situations, but make no mistake - even experts lose or can have a run of bad luck as any game that's as RNG dependent as FTL can have a great run turn into defeat (my latest run with the Rock A cruiser). Conversely, you will also have runs which start out awful or look bleak and you'll somehow make it through which is a fantastic feeling. If you can handle the basic graphics, minimal story, and hard difficulty, this game is worth it and then some. If you're put off by constant defeat or losing repeatedly while figuring out what to do, maybe hold off. But even then, it's still worth the 5 bucks I paid when it was on sale",

The main screen is your ship, where all the action happens. You travel between different points to get to the end beacon the go to the next sector. I will note right now: THIS GAME IS HARD. This game is extremely difficult. And it is also Permadeath. Die, and it's all the way back to the beginning. There are randomly generated events with choices, and ship battles. I will not explain these mechanics in this review, because is it hard to explain with sounding more boring than sitting in a waiting room reading a book about dust.

Not just some lone shmuck flying a fighter or a transport ship between systems; an actual captain, with a real ship with compartments, corridors and subsystems and a real crew to obey my orders. As soon as I realized that this game could let me do that, I grabbed it.   FTL is a challenging game, all the more so by the fact that you get only one life - when you die, you're dead - that's what a 'Rogue-like' game is. As in real life, failure means the destruction of your ship and crew. That's ok - the game is designed for multiple play-throughs, and a full game takes only a couple of hours to finish. As you must always stay one step ahead of the onrushing enemy, you can never unlock everything during a single play session, and a large number of unlockable ships provides incentive to keep playing again and again.   Combat is frenetic and nail-biting, as you must manage everything seemingly at once. You must keep an eye on your hull integrity, move your crewmen from room to room in order to repair damage and keep key systems online, even repel boarders who will otherwise wreak havoc on your ship. All the while you have to try to blow the other guy out of space! A wide variety of different enemy ships and armaments means that the same tactics will rarely work twice.   On top of everything, there is a multi-layered RPG system in place. Keep crewmen at one duty post and they will gain skill in that discipline, increasing your effectiveness. Scrap collected after each encounter must be used wisely - do you spend it all to upgrade your ship, or keep some in the hopes of finding a shop and buying new weapons? Keep in mind that you also need it to buy ammo, fuel, and repair your hull! There's never enough resources to upgrade everything to the max - you must choose carefully and decide what to focus on.",

            "review_text": "Now that I have played some more of FTL, I'd like to give my current thoughts on the game: it still blows. Despite the game having many good concepts, FTL is a game that suffers from artificial difficulty to the max. You start off by setting sail into the deep ends of space. Sounds interesting, right? Unfortunately, that's where you begin to see many of the flaws of FTL, the first being the poorly implemented RPG system. Your crew members supposedly get better the more they use certain skills, but unfortunately, it doesn't really help all that much, so it's kinda pointless. Even worse is the game's balance in battle, as sometimes, the enemy has an advantage over you, even in the beginning level of the game. Worst of all is the game's lack of strategy. Yes, strategy is in this game, but luck is an even bigger factor here. In fact, luck IS the main factor of this game. Now, I know that rogue-likes have a luck factor, but many of them also have a skill factor that balances out the luck factor. This game, however, takes the luck factor way too far, and even worse is not being able to properly strategize and prepare because of the rebel fleet chasing your puny ♥♥♥ ship in space. The moments where you do get to strategize, which is during battle, doesn't help all that much, and battle that are easy tend to be boring as hell. The game is also repetitive, and not in a good way. The presentation department is also a joke. There's a good way to do wannabe retro, and there's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ way. FTL falls into the latter, containing mediocre chiptune music and really crappy graphics. Speaking of wannabe retro, how come this game lags? Seriously, this is a 2D game with ♥♥♥♥ graphics, not an FPS that requires you to have a high-end graphics card. In the end, the game is a lame piece of ♥♥♥♥ that is overrated by its fanboys, who probably have never played any other rogue-likes aside from this game and The Binding of Isaac.",

How unfortunate...  The best part of the entire situation though I'm going to steal from the youtube review Pyrion Flax gave the game, but really it's not that this game has anything against you. For one thing it's a computer program. and even better it's procedurely generated. That means that whatever situation it throws you in when you least expect it is completely random. The only thing you can take from this is that this game doesn't hate you, fate itself hates you. Honestly I have restarted this game more than any other game I believe I own, even Xcom. It's one of those games I suggest doing it on easy mode unless you get really good at the game or just want to hate youself.  In the end though, it's a masterfully done game. The way it both frustrates you and draws you in at the same time is mind boggling. The graphics are pretty well done for a 2D game, and honestly I can hardly see how they could be done better in 3D. It has pretty much infinite replayability, and even new content now and then. If you're into strategy and space games this is a must have really.  It's not perfect, there are a couple things I would like to see, probably the most important being a more noticeable warning light when you're oxygen is running out. I have actually killed my crew several times because I didn't notice they were all suffocating to death until it was too late. I've even gone a few jumps before realizing my ship was devoid of air. It can be a problem, but honestly if this is the biggest complaint I can come up with about the game then I'll deal with it. It even has mods, which I can't say I've tried yet",

That said the game is extremely compelling and fun.  The power managment system of your ship had me flashing back to when I was a kid watching an episode of Star Trek and hearing the Captain shout 'All power to shields, brace for impact!'. The Power system can lead to some interesting scenarios, especially when you're in a power draining nebula or your ship has been damaged. Do you put all power to weapons and hope your crew doesn't suffocate from the 02 system being off for too long, or do you put what little power you have into engines in hopes of escaping?  The resource managment is also an interesting mechanic that leads to many important choices. Do you beef up your weapons but leave your ship as tough as the average tissue paper, sink all of your points into armor and have a tank with a pea shooter, or do you attempt a balanced build that leaves your ship mediocre in most areas? Thanks to the randomness of the game you are often helped by random chance scenarios that give you a ton of spare scrap metal or new weapons and mods. Unfortunatly on the other side of the coin you have just as much of a chance that five Mantis warriors will board your ship and tear through your crew and you'll be forced to restart the game.  There are several different ships and ship layouts to be unlocked as well. If you're having too much trouble with the first ship, don't worry. After a couple of runthroughs you'll begin to unlock other alien ships that lead to very different styles of play. If you're doing terribly with the Kestrel Layout 1 then perhaps you'll do better with the Drone heavy Engi ship. The sheer randomness of the game is what helps its longevity, so don't worry if you have a bad playthrough. You'll get a great one soon enough.  Don't let the games difficulty put you off. Even if you never manage to beat this game it is still a ton of fun, and it is always sold at a deep discount during the Steam sales. Do yourself a favor and buy it.",

It's good when you want to play a game but can't invest much time into the session. The game is very tactical, with the hard decisions you have to make stopping at planets and the combat. The latter in particular is ingenious, because there are so many different ways you can take down ships. You can simply try to blow up their hull, or board them for extra resources. Or, if you particularly evil, you can bomb their oxygen supply and just suffocate the enemy crew to death. Targeting substations like the weapons, shield, and previously mentioned oxygen supply will prevent the enemy from ultilizing them, but the foe can wipe out your substations as well. Also, it's all real time, so you have to be quick thinking to pull out. The best thing is that end game content is just as balanced as early game, so death's sythce is as present on the first world as it is on the last, and it is very present. One wrong move and your ship will go kaput.  However, unlocking new ships is a ♥♥♥♥♥, so don't expect to get new ships until multiple playthroughs in. How tediously long and random it is to get new ships is very artifical in difficulty and not dependent on skill. It's really my only major complaint for this game. The game can also generate some unfair situations. I've had boarding actions during solar flares (a random room catches on fire every so often until you leave the 'planet' you're on), which depending on where the flares strike and who's boarding (one species of aliens are immune to fire), can kill you quickly.  Also, the soundtrack kicks major ♥♥♥. Fits the mood of the game perfectly and is just good tunes in itself. Half the reason to play this game is for the music. If you're into buying game soundtracks, definitly do it for this game.",

It is difficult to advance and unlock new ships, and even harder to actually beat the final boss. As of the writing of this review I have almost 50 hours sunk into this game and have only come close to actually beating the flagship once. On easy mode I may add.   Quite addicting once you get the hang of the gameplay and wrap your head around the sheer randomness of the game world. This is a game that you could sit down and easily play multiple times, or sit down and comfortably play once if you only have half an hour to spare. This is effectively the only game where I can invest lots of time into a playthrough, die stupidly because some loser nobody pirates decided to hack my oxygen system, scream '♥♥♥♥ THIS GAME' and hit play again.   Also, a word of warning. Avoid the mantis at all costs. This game can very qucikly turn into 'Getting rekt by the mantis simulator 2014' if you do otherwise.

Be careful of the choices you make becuase they can either help you or hinder you, sometimes saving your ship and sometimes being the end of your little journey.

Luckily like mentioned above you can pause combat, if you are stumped in battle and need to re-think your strategy.

The game's challenges can be cruel, unfair, and hostile, but you're a spaceship captain! Deal with it!  Unlocking new equipment and vessels, discovering new tricks and devices, formulating new strategies, scrambling to fix it when things go wrong... It's everything a starship command sim should be. My only complaint is the rebel fleet's endless and insatiable pursuit... Many times I've had to abandon my explorations to escape them, leaving behind possibilities and treasures.

The objective is simple, get your ship to the end of the series of sectors without getting stomped and ransacked and destroy the Rebel mothership, which is a giant hunk of OP metal. The mechanics are all there and all have their place and strategies. The story is negligible but the scenarios are believable and tension is very much there as you progress and have to manage your resources and arsenal. Music is wonderful and really captures the atmosphere, or lack of, of space and has a beautiful serene feel to it but quickly shifts to tense battle music when confronted. Unfortunately, a lot of minor things are reliant on RNG, something I find a negative in almost all cases, such as hit%, fire, and whether you'll land on a star, pulsar, or have a crew die to some random event you run across. Hit% improves as the game progresses and there are ways to know where you're going but this still doesn't change that the RNG is very real.",

In addition, you can get more efficiency out of your systems by having the proper crew manage each system. You also get to target which enemy systems you can target with your weapons. Choosing wisely in any of these areas can mean the difference between victory and becoming a loose association of floating debris.  Each playthrough is relatively short, but the replay value is immense! You only start with access to one playable ship and you unlock the others by progressing in the game or by finding hidden quests. Each ship has several different designs available, if you can unlock them.   The game can be quite unforgiving at times with a random number generator.

I've played it time after time, sure that at some point it'd click, and I'd suddenly gain understanding that would let me unlock the game's potential. I feel confident in saying now that that's just not possible.  I play roguelikes. I've got platinum god in Binding of Isaac, I've beaten Rogue Legacy and Risk of Rain. I've beaten Nethack MULTIPLE times. There's a trick, to all these roguelikes. When you begin, how well you do seems to be a matter of luck, of getting the perfect run. As you come to understand the game's mechanics, however, you improve to the point where almost, if not every run has the potential to win. The makers of FTL didn't understand this concept, clearly. They got as far as 'randomly generated' and stopped paying attention. You can be placed immediately into situations you cannot win. You can go an entire run without finding any upgrades or shops, until the federation fleet with 2 drones, 3 weapons &amp; tier 3 shields is breathing down your neck. And of course, the entire combat is HEAVILY luck based. Yes, creators, it feels so good when 3 missiles miss in a row and the enemy tears my ship a new exhaust port in return.  There's also the matter of this game's idea of balance. Missile/bomb weapons are incredibly powerful compared to beam weapons. The tradeoff is meant to be a limited amount of ammo. So, you know, a limitation clearly not applied to the AI, who will happily send a couple dozen missiles your way, ignoring all that effort you put into your shields AND whatever subsystem it hits.   In short, FTL bills itself as a roguelike, and that's laughable. Play it only if you like gambling in a time-inefficient manner.",

Your ship is manned by 3 people, more can be gotten at space stations, from other ships, and for the occasional store that orbits about awaiting new customers. You can also by ship upgrades, weapons, and of rourse, fuel which is always a good idea to have plenty of. Enemy ships are of various types, fighters, bombers, and traders, as well as the ubitquitous scout. Quests are included, though they are more like directed flight plans, but still fun to follow up on. I am not great at these kinds of games but I scored 673, which is very low for everyone else in the world, but for me it awesome! Your ship's screens should be upgraded first, then the reactor energy level, then weapons when possible - I upgraded twice but it cost a fortune and I never had enough fuel (currency) or scrap (also currency) to buy more. A game that does what it does well, could have been far more complicated and could have cost a whole lot more if it were, so-no complaints here, for the buck it delivers an hour or so of solid entertainment that is strategic more than courageous and will leave you wanting a truly good version of Star Trek.

            "review_text": "If you haven't watched Firefly, I suggest you do so now. If you HAVE, however, then enjoy this game, as it is basically as close to Firefly: The Game as it gets. Addictive, fun, beautiful, deceptively hard, and less linear than a swimming pool, even the thought of fighting for the Federation and not the rebels couldn't keep me away!  The existence of so many different systems and so many ways to upgrade existing systems leads to a huge variety of ways to play, with no one right solution to any problem. Don't like to get your hands dirty? Use drones! Shields getting in your way? Use missiles! On a budget? Just board the enemy ship and kill their crew! Want to kill the crew but all you have is this fire-bomb? Use the fire-bomb and watch as your enemies rush around desperately trying to put out the fires that just won't stop popping up in their Oxygen room.  The sheer amount of systems the player needs to manage (with the help of their meager but ever-developing crew) also adds a huge amount of complexity to the game. If a system gets damaged it will no longer function until your crew repairs it. The AI's targeting system is completely random, so you never know if that incoming Artemis missile will hit your door control and do virtually nothing, hit your sensors and blind you, forcing you to turn up your sound to listen for hull breaches, fires, etc; or hit your oxygen room and slowly drain your oxygen until your entire crew suffocates.  The various alien races all have neat little bonuses (yes, even Humans, which were buffed ever so slightly in Advanced Edition so they recieve training in the major systems faster). These bonuses are game-changingly powerful, but each and every one is extremely situational. The Mantis and Rock are the optimal choices for close-quarters combat, for example, with the mantis having increased damage and the rock having increased health and immunity to fire damage. However, the rock are painfully slow when moving and mantis repair at half speed, making them useless on a damaged ship. Zoltan have pitiful health but give 1 permanent power bar to the system they are manning, Lanius have boosted health and are immune to suffocation but drain the oxygen out of the room they are in, Engi are weaker in combat but repair faster, Crystal are slightly slower and tougher and have the ability to lock a room down temporarily, and the slugs have amazing telepathic powers that help them see inside enemy ships.  The game is balanced so that you will always be surviving just by the seat of your pants, unless you get extremely lucky. This expert balance system means that players are kept on their toes the entire game. As you upgrade and develop your ship, the scrap rewards scale up but the enemy ships get stronger. This balance system scales up so well that, especially on Hard mode, almost every situation needs to be carefully weighed, as most combat scenarios (especially late-game) are high-risk, high-reward.  Developing a strategy in FTL is something that happens during a game rather than before it, which is relatively unique in the Strategy gaming world. Yes, each ship's starting layout gives you an idea of how to secure a bit of scrap early game, but throughout the game you will be buying and selling weapons, drones, systems, augments, and anything else you can get your hands on in order to develop your ship into an effective fighting machine for whatever little scrap you may have in your storage. Effective strategies and knowing how and when to use each item can lead to amazing synergies, such as the use of a Glaive beam with a Weapons Pre-Igniter to cut down on its drawn-out charge time, or using ion weaponry to take down shields and then dealing damage with combat drones.  The beacons and sectors are randomly arranged, so no two runs are alike. You can find yourself hopping between civilian sectors one run only to find yourself barely scraping through two Abandoned Sectors and one Rebel Stronghold the next. The pursuing rebel fleet is another brilliant mechanic, as it encourages you to keep moving while scavenging as much loot as possible. The pursuing rebels are tough stuff, too, some even coming equipped with Chain Vulcans and level 4 shields!  Being a roguelike game, FTL likes to mess with the player. As a result, you will die very, very frequently. The great thing about FTL, though, is that it never feels cheap. Your death is always the result of YOUR actions. Not in an in-your-face way, either. You never just die because you forgot to check the corner for snipers or something (like in, oh, say, CS:GO), you always die as the result of a pleathora of factors working together. For example, you took way too much damage in the last fight and had to jump away with a broken shields system and half Hull points, only to jump straight into an asteroid field. The asteroids pelt your ship, damaging systems and hurting your hull while the pursuing pirate teleports a fire-bomb to your Oxygen room and an Intruder Ion drone into your weapons. The drone smashes a hole in the hull and makes short work of your weapons, leaving you defenseless, while the fire spreads from your O2 to the rest of the ship. As you send in your crew to put out the fires, an explosion is heard coming from the Oxygen room. The fires must have caught on an oxygen tank and exploded, and now your oxygen system is completely offline. This becomes a problem, as you had been trying to fight the flames by opening your airlock to vent the fires. Hoping to salvage the situation, yousend your crew to the Medbay and close all airlocks and interior doors. However, a shor from the enemy burst lazer strikes your medbay JUST as the first crew-member enters, killing her instantly. In a panic, you rush two other crewmembers to the oxygen room to put out the fires and repair the system before you all suffocate, and you send your pilot to repair the shields. You cross your fingers and pray, but the autopilot just can't evade the enemy's shots without the assistance of your pilot. You manage to get the pilot out of the shields room just as another fire-bomb incinerates everything inside, but while you were distracted your other two crew-members burned alive in the oxygen room. At this point, the fires have spread to every room but the helm, where you send your pilot in a desperate attempt to save him. At last, the final few laser shots from the enemy sail straight toward an exposed section of your hull, and your last three hull points are depleted. One last explosion rocks your ship as it is torn apart, ending yet another fantastic journey in FTL.  Overall, this game is very well made in every aspect. One of the best games I have ever played.",

            "review_text": "Faster than light was genuinely a really fun game.  It's a rouge style game except in this case the dungeon is interstellar space filled with hostile pirates and rebels. Each playthrough is heavily based on luck, which is not a bad thing. With the amount of scrap that you recieve for upgrades, it keeps you almost certain that no matter how strong your weapons or shields are, there is always some chance that a massive ♥♥♥♥♥torm is lying in wait for you at the next jump beacon that you are not prepared for. Decisons made are memorable, as you can lose your crew with all of the xp they've gained in their prospective fields, fairly regularly. The thing that FTL totally takes away from you as the player, is any sense of control of the world around you. You're just the lone federation ship, that is supposed to have some hope of taking on the rebel capital ship in a single fight, and if you play on even normal difficulty, it's unlikely you'll even make it that far before some ♥♥♥♥ing pirate ship with three defence drones and max shield upgrades ♥♥♥♥s you up on the third stage. The difficulty the game provides you in that uncertainty, is really fun to expierence.  However, after a few playthroughs of the game, this will start to die down as you come into the same random events, knowing which options are the right and wrong ones to take. And seeing how you will likely be dying often and will see the same events very often, it's pretty upsetting that the sense of total spontaneity is gone. If you decide to continue to play it after this point, it won't be about expierencing the game as the unique thing it was for the first 5 or so hours of play, it'll be more of a speed race to see how fast you can beat the game or seeing how badass of a ship you can customize if you linger around zones for as long as possible to get the maximum amount of scrap from it.  Overall, I'd reccomend getting this game if you want to find something truly different from most other games, at least for a few hours. If it's on sale or if you have the 10 bucks lying around, go ahead and get it. You probably won't regret it.",

New weapons, more quests, better RNG for quest outcomes. A very plesant suprise.  This game isn't perfect. I like thinking I'm the best, and when over 95% of my runs end with a ship on fire and a dead crew. I tend to think it's too hard. I don't want the difficulty to change of course. This game just kicks my ♥♥♥ and upsets me.  The soundtrack is pretty good. I bought it, there are some good tracks in there. This is a game that should be in everyone's steam library. It's simple enough to do one run, spend an hour on it and move on for a bit. Yet it's system is deep enough to keep players engrossed for scores of hours. Even should they unlock ALL the ships and ALL the layouts for said ships. That said I'd like steam integration for unlocked ships as achievements. But that's a nit pick.

The creators of the game even admit that hard mode is intended to be won 1 out of 10 tries. If you ask me, this is a real killer. I don't want to put in an hour of really good gameplay to have RNG put me in a literally unwinnable situation. All that said, FTL is a hell of a fun game. Even in easy/normal modes at first it can be punishingly difficult, but not without a lesson learned from each failure. The most fun part of the game is unlocking all of the ships, and trying to defeat the Rebels with as many as possible. Once you really have everything unlocked, it can get boring and frustrating, but that really does take a while. For the price of this game, I don't think you can beat it.

You click jump and launch faster than light to the distress signal only to find that it was a trap set up by a group of pirates!

You watch with mouth slightly agape in dis-belief as a heavy laser mark II soars accross your screen, breaks through the enemy's weak shields and then smashes full-force into the flimsy hull of the pirate ship. In shock you imagine the vacuum of space robbing the young bandits of everything they had, even the right to one last scream as it instantly tears them into impossibly small shreds leaving only 14 meager pieces of scrap drifting in the black void of space as a remebrance of the hard and troubled lives those murauders led before they were smeared from the pages of history. Your ships crew retrieves the scrap with a robotic arm and then returns to their posts and awaits your orders.

The combat and systems management are really engaging and challenging and make for endless fun. The fear of total irreversible death at any moment looms over giving a serious edge to every decision you make. When all is said and done, the modding angle give the game unlimited potential long after you've played the vanilla game to exhaustion.",

I always wonder if i had done something different, or picked up that extra weapon, or focused more on building my sheilds, maybe just maybe i could have taken down that rebel ship. Every play through feels like a completely different experience and since i first picked this game up that have added a patch that increases the game content, for free i might add. If you ever had thought about what it would be like to be the captain of your own spaceship, then look no further, this is the game for you.",

He was a ship engineer before he settled at the colony. He joined up with us out of gratitude. He's taken over in the engine room from our Mantis, who is much happier running security detail, where she can maul boarding parties to death.  Jump #8 - Ambushed by cloaked Rebel Interceptor waiting at the jump beacon. Life support took heavy damage. Charrl got sucked into space trying to repair a hull breach. Life expectancy on this mission kinda blows.  Jump # 9 - Ran across critically damaged civilian ship being pursued by bounty hunters. Bounty Hunters didn't offer a very good bribe so we killed them. Sadly the civvies all suffocated because their life support failed while we were busy fighting.  Jump #10 - Crew morale was low and our hull was in serious need of repair. Arrived at federation-friendly station. No life-signs aboard. Crew wiped out, Rebel AI running the systems. This galaxy sucks.  Jump #27 - Navigating a nebula when our Rockman weapons officer was mind-controlled and allows himself to be teleported off-ship by Slug kidnappers. They held him for ransom, which we couldn't pay. They blew his brains out right there on the viewscreen. Mantis crewman was quite excited to use the weapons console, we killed them quickly as vengeance.  Jump #42 - Mantis crewman revealed she had an illicit liason during a stay aboard a space station in the last sector, and became pregnant. Being in deep space and not really knowing how else to deal with a hormonal alien killing machine, I congratulated her. At that point she revealed her offspring had already hatched and was pretty much fully-grown. In honour of the alliance between our two people she named her child 'Daughter'. Truly, a strange people.

The many flavors of ships make the progress seem intact; while you deal with the end battle with the boss. The art style is gorgeous, the encounters are unique, and the end battles make you want to prepare and can catch you off-guard if you're not.

It can take longer if you wish, as you can pause the game and micromanage your units anytime you would like.   The rogue-like element is well balanced. Expect to lose and learn from it. It never seems too unfair. You may find yourself panicking at moments such as when your shields fail and an un-attended fire begins leaking into your engine bay.   You can already tell that it is sapce and sci-fi-ish, and I'm sure you wouldnt make it this if you don't like space games.

However, it gets progressively more difficult the farther you move along in space and the final boss is no push over. Also, with the 'Infinite Space' mod, it adds a whole new way to play this game. Instead of being worried about being chased by the Rebel fleet (no not the peace loving ones from Star Wars), you can free roam around space until you eventually are murdered in a very crushing way. The only problem with the mod is that it has a weird difficulty spike not too long after you start. The music is also a fantastic part of this game and really adds a something extra incredible to it. It's both intense when you're in combat and very peaceful when just hovering around space. one thing that you should be warned of are the random events that happen through your journey. You may be that guy/girl who really likes to help everyone you come across, but sometimes, if you help that random stranger, you'll either get damaged or you could even lose a crew member, which is devestating. Your crew is your most important part about this, other than the ship itself of course. The best way to win a fight is to assign each person to a specific section on the ship and have them monitor/ repair it. If you don't, well then your weapons won't charge up fast enough, or you won't have enough evade skill to dodge a missile, so it really helps if you have someone at each section or at least the most important ones to stay alive. Overall, I would strongly reccomend this to anyone who really likes a good strategy game with a high difficulty and also someone who has always wanted to command their own ship and fell like somebody out of Star Trek.",

            "review_text": " Things You'll Like:   +Replayability  It's a space roguelike/strategy/simulation. While there is a simple story to follow, it's more about exploring the galaxy and seeing all the cool stuff you can find/unlock. While a typical game will take 2-4 hours, that only covers about 4% of the experience because of all the random encounters and secrets to find. Each ship has a semi-random assortment of weapons and systems which keeps each fight interesting. With each new playthrough, you can learn new tactics and evolve your strategy over time.   +Tactics  The game is deceptively simple as there are a limited number of actions you can take at any given time. However, FTL is one of the few games that really lets you employ unique and creative strategies with the tools you have at your disposal. For example, each room has an oxygen level. Venting your ship's oxygen supply can deter intruders and extinguish fires, but it makes it 'uncomfortable' for your crew. At any point, you can stop time with the space bar, letting you examine the scenario and do any commands you need to. This lets you try strategies that require split-second timing and respond to threats with lightning speed.   +Decision-making  Just as it says in the trailer, you can be the captain of your ship, and FTL executes this remarkably well. The level of decision-making you have lets you apply your own personal play style and strategies. Every decision you make matters for the fate of your crew. You must assess risk vs. reward with each encounter. Ambitious ventures into uncharted nebulas can reap huge rewards or end in death when an ion storm takes out your oxygen.   +Consistency of game universe.  You'll find yourself getting attached to your crew members and your ship. This creates an immersive experience and makes all the events happening in the universe seem important. There is a backstory behind each encounter that provides a little insight into the culture and the everyday happenings of the game's citizens. Each alien race has a definite personality that you have to take into account during interactions with them. Interacting with benevolent Engi usually turns out well, however wily Slug creatures are often less than truthful.   +Pacing  FTL is organized very well. Each node/'encounter' is about 1-5 minutes long, there's about 20 nodes per sector, and there are eight sectors. There are many meaningful choices you make along the way, as 'store' or 'distress' nodes are well marked and each sector has an overall theme/alien race associated with it. And, for the entire game, you're being chased by the overwhelming wave of Rebel ships. This gives you an experience that is fluid and fast-paced, but gives you the freedom to think and make your own choices. FTL is totally 100% gameplay, there's no cutscenes or cinematic elements that you have to sit through. (However, you really should read the encounter description or else you might miss something important or make a regrettable mistake).   +Audio/Graphics  The art style is really well done. The backgrounds and soundtrack really fit the mood of the game. The graphics are pixelated, yes, but there's a lot of detail and care put into it. It's not 'retro for the sake of retro', but a style that's consistent and perfect for this type of game, emphasizing readability and clarity over flashy or photorealistic visuals.  +Interface  If you look at screenshots of FTL, every one has a spaceship or two and some HUD icons around the outside. However, the amount of information they pack into every frame is amazing. The combination of audio cues and visual alerts keep you constantly informed without overwhelming you. Because every second counts, you can easily lose if you split your attention, but the interface is really good at showing you exactly what you need to know. Allowing you to stop time at will helps as well.   +Overall Experience  Seems like a bit of a lame topic, but it really needs to be said. It's such a small dev studio but it produced an experience that really feels 'complete'. You don't feel like anything's missing or done poorly. That's more than you can say for even big-budget games these days. Whether or not you enjoy the game, you must at least notice that the game is pretty much flawlessly made. It's detailed and nothing seems out of place.   Things You Might Not Like:    ~Difficulty  It's harder than most games even on Easy mode, a real challenge that doesn't always give you a clear path to success. The randomness doesn't help this at all. Going in, you have to be prepared to build up a ship you think is 'good' only to have it crash and burn in the next encounter. The defining moment for most people is if they give up before they start realizing the more nuanced strategies and tactics you have at your disposal. However, it is possible to win (even with some of the weaker ships you unlock).   ~Randomness  This turns some people away from the game (if not the entire genre). There are 'unwinnable' scenarios, especially if you pick a bad ship and it's early on in the game. However, if you get good, you can survive in any ship at least to the last sector. This is not a game that tells you a predefined story or sets you off on a path to a destination. It's a simulation with a bunch of random events, and really random stuff will happen to you in space.   ~Permadeath, with only one save state  You can only have one game saved at a time, and if you lose, the save is deleted. It's a system that fits with the rest of the game, but can be annoying. Allowing for multiple save states would ruin the randomness of the game, so if anything it's a necessary evil.   ~Exploration difficulties  Though much of the game is based on exploration, there are time constraints that force you to move forward rather than explore around the entire sector. Some nodes are just impractical to reach because you're being chased by rebel forces. You have to balance your curiousity for the game's universe with your need to stay alive. This is a bit of a struggle because the game shows you so much awesome stuff but doesn't let you visit all of it in one playthrough.   ~Filler Nodes  While there is a lot of content in the game, there are some nodes that are rather empty, or just have a token Auto-Assault Scout to fight. Almost every ship is unique due to the variety of weapons and configurations available, but many of the random encounters are pretty similar. Recognizing some of the same events occuring over multiple playthroughs can break immersion a little. These filler nodes can be helpful though after a tough encounter if they give you a break from the action. (e.g. ship is still on fire and you jumped away from an asteroid field and you have intruders)  Overall I highly recommend this game.",

WIth its permadeath feature, and randomized elements there is a lot of replayability. Its a pretty fun rogue-style space exploration game but for an space game, it takes place in a tiny, semi-linear universe, with limited RPG elements. The main campaign is also a bit too linear. Also, there is currently no endless mode. The game+ mode is fun since you get to fly different ship and build new crews, but while new ships are fun, and the different races are enjoyable to play with, I wish there was a bit more there.",

Good:  Great replay value with randomly generated sectors and unlockable ships and layouts; multiple winning strategies and gameplay isn't limited to one approach; constant danger forces the player to learn how to make the best of the current situation.  Bad:  Bad luck on many events can screw you over, even with skilled play; some weapons and augmentations are just awful and not worth using; enemy AI could use some improvement when targeting your ship.  Verdict:  High difficulty curve might put off some players at first, but it becomes very enjoyable and rewarding when you get better.   Rating:  8/10   Recommendation:  Try it. If you like it you'll get hours of gameplay for your money's worth; if you hate it then you'll be out 10 bucks at the most.",

You start off as a small federation ship somewhere in space in a time where there is war between Rebels and the Federation. As you play along you make your way through sectors, upgrading your ship's shields, engine, weapons and many more aswell as recruiting new crew members on your way.  You have a certain amount of Fuel, Missiles and Drone parts which you can use to help you on your journey. Sometimes at beacons on your journey you will get to fight other ships, using Weapons and Drones, and after you defeated them, you will earn resources (Fuel, Missiles, Drone parts), scrap which can be used to upgrade your ship and maybe even weapons or drone scematics!  If you aren't doing too well resource wise, you can still visit a shop and buy some using your scrap. Also in these shops you can purchase new systems for your ship, for example Cloaking, Drone control besides weapons, drone schmeatics and arguments for your ship.  Something which also is a lot of fun, are the randomly generated events which occur on your jounrey. Based on what decisions you make, you can lose a crew member, gain one, get a lot of resources, take damage to your ship and many more.

I hope you guys don't think less of me because I can't get my ship up. To sector 7.  Anywho. Your character is a space ship. The crew is more inventory than anything else. You can even buy them at shops. It's like playing captain in Star Trek assuming that your crew listens to you. And assuming that Star Trek ships died every episode and you'd get a new ship to watch, instead of the same crew every time.  This certainly is a strong contender in the strategy/roguelike genre. The music is solid, especially if you like retro or 8-bit styled music. The graphics are not super duper shiny, but if you're coming from Nethack, you expected worse. And don't get me wrong, these graphics really reinforce their purpose. Shinier would probably have felt out of place in the genre.  Now then, if you're considering buying this, I'm sure you've already found out that the battle in this game is an interesting kind of real time. It's kind of the same real time that Final Fantasy 12 was. The game can go on and on if you leave it, but you can only act once meters have filled and you can pause while telling your crew what to do. For the record, I really liked Final Fantasy 12. And by extension I enjoy this game too.  If you're looking for a strategy game that will kill you, but can be overcome, this is the place to find it. It's got DF style 'fun' (read: dieing often) in droves. And if you like that, then this game will suit you well.",

This game has a random generation aspect to it which is pretty good. The different sectors you go to are randomized, and all of the different lovations in these sectors will greet you with some interesting diologue, and more often than not some strategic space ship combat.  This is where the game really shines. The combat system they have used for this game works incredibly well combined with the random generation aspect of it. You will very rarely be using the exact same ship twice in a row, regardless of what it might seem like initially. The combat system allowes you to focus on whatever type of combat you want to defeat the rebel scum (among other naughty space baddies). Want to pass through the enemy's shields? No problem! Want to have a crew of combat ready Mantis people invade your enemy's ship? No problem! Want to make your enemies fight themselves!? No problem! All of the various part and pieces you can outfit your ship with allow you to use whatever meathod of combat you want.  This game is a strategy game, no if's, and's, or but's. It takes a certian level of skill to play on the harder difficulties, while the easy levels will still require some form of higher thinking to defeat any compatent foe. Throughout the game you will have to decide how to efficiently use your recources (fuel, missles, drones, and scrap). Scrap is your currency in this game and it will determine whether you upgrade your shields, or buy that really cool looking cloaking device from the shop, or maybe the hacking module, oh, or maybe... well... you get the idea. As you battle other ships, your ship will of course take damage, and how you deal with this damage is up to you! You will have to manage your crew members and make competent decisions on whether to keep your pilot at the helm in order to increas your evasion, or put out that fire that just burst out in your engine room.  If you are looking for a really different and unique ship combat style then look no further, because this is the game for you. I whole heartedly recommend this game, I have spend a good amount of time playing it both on my computer, and on my iPad. This game will have you coming back, with its awesome combat system, large variety of enemies, playable ships, and weapons, and all manner of quirky and hilarious diologue.

So here are my findings if you have not experienced FTL before.   The new Advanced addition update has added a huge amount of content every thing from new guns, the way ships are unlocked and even a new race of oxygen consuming, metal eating, ugly m************. Who have caused me much pain a suffering already. As for the new guns well things are not much better on that front either. From lasers the fire faster the more you use them to a multi barrelled ion cannon that charges up the can release two, three or four (I think, two and three confirmed) shots at a time. Well lets just say gone are the days of lusting after four L2 multi lasers. Though the only new type of gun I have come across is a shotgun type of mass accelerator cannon which is very affective against shields. Now for the fun part the new systems every thing from cloning to mind control. There is nothing more satisfying than making an enemy blow his or her own ship up because you fried their brain and made them pound on their engines. As for the clones that's a bit more complicated and is a sort of pro con affair. If you like to teleport over and go all Rambo on an enemy crew then its a major plus if not then you may not be so interested.   Now please be aware I have not covered everything there are a few more slices of cake left to discover. The above selection was just what I liked a lot or caused me great pain.  So to conclude. With the new additions and today's success rate of zero I would say that FTL is now even harder than before. So if you wimp out at even the mention of Dark Souls then you will find this a frustrating game even on easy. But if like me you are a glutton for punishment and cannot accept that a mere machine can out smart you then you will find a rewarding experience well worth the money ",

The only additions to this game should have been extra ships (one is present and welcome) and a variety of Co-op and Vs multiplayer modes. Advanced has neither.

Will you hire a full crew, or only enough to keep your ship running and buy some repair drones to fix your ship systems for you?

You might be prepared for it, or invested in completely useless systems. Trying to setup your ship for the worst rarely stays true till the end of journey. Resources are scarse, enemies are tougher and tougher and it's only a matter of time or bad luck when you will face a scenario that will finish you off.  Just when you thought big guns can solve any kind of disagreement, you find that enemies have teleported on your ship, and are on a killing spree, and you don't have reinforced doors to keep them away from your crew. And while all that is going on, enemy ship is disabling your shields, rapturing hull so oxigen is leaking and keeps firing at you - what will you do? Buy it, and see how that would turn out.   Seriously, go for it! It may look simple, but with so many mechanics, each playing it's role, it will give you hours upon hours tactics, frustration and fun!  10/10",

When you play through it the first time you will probably think ''Hm, well this looks interesting, but all the same in the end, right? Well lets at least give it another try'' FTL isnt build so you get everything in one try. You have to explore the whole galaxy endless times, sometimes make more risky decisions and dare your fate to see what comes out. Sometimes it is better to listen to others, sometimes not. Here an example. In one game i got boarded by pirates AND unlocked a new Ship-Design by listening to AI. So sometimes you just have to trust, even if it hurts. The whole game is just set about exploring, gathering and fighting. Over time you will find out special things, like a weakness in one races shield system, or what to do when you encounter friendly lifeforms on a planet. Also, unique equipment and personell can give you unique opportunities and ways to solve quests more efficient and increase your rewards. The Game is designed with a payload of love and brings you beatiful backgrounds and graphics (in retro-standards). Anyway, heres a little Sum-Up of how i think about the games pros and cons:  + You learn fast through trial and error, suited even for unexperienced gamers + Simple but intense fights with fair AI + An ever-changing Universe filled with mystery + Different ship designs to start a Game with can be unlocked through special actions and events + Balanced money-upgrading system + Pause the game whenever you want! So Savepoints or crap like that + Take a break whenever you want, pause fights to overthink your strategy + Well equipped merchants + Realtime dangers like asteroid fields, which dont stop after a fight is over + An ever pushing force on your back forcing you to consider your movement wisely + Insane earworm-soundtrack which you just can not get enough of + A retrofeeling comes up instantly, for all you Retro-Fans out there! (Including me) + I have never encountered glitches, bugs or anything else + Lovely Graphics + GIANT BONUS: IT'S CHEAP!!!  okay, even the best game has some flaws, I can only think of one though:  - The Boss is insanely hard to beat and is a giant boulder of obliteration on your road to victory  All in all, this Game is just awesome, and i would not consider it impossile to bring out a second part with even more features. Anyway, a definite must have for fans of retro and round based gameplay and definitely just a game which totally delivers the ''Just-One-More-Turn(Jump)-Mood''",

Graphics fit, complexities become simple once you play through a few times, sounds are great, and the music is fantastic. The only draw back is that it is only single player (though I don't see how multiplayer would work). Maybe that might be added in later.

Well over 40 hours in I still haven't unlocked half the cruisers or stopped playing on easy mode because the game continually presents a challenge and the random generations of sectors means you may face a perilous journey through seven unfriendly sectors or jump far more peacefully through Engi sectors only to discover your gentle trip left you underprepared for The Last Stand. Every time the world is regenerated you are presented with a new set of challenges as to how you will outfit your ship to take down the Big Boss.

Is it for everyone... no, but then what game is.  Some people have posted reviews that criticise the difficulty, permadeath and randomness of the game. In my opinion it is these elements that make this game the gem that it is. Too often in modern games I find myself redoing missions and short segments of missions when they don't go the way I want, it is a hard habit to break (though one I'm trying to), and ultimately takes all the enjoyment out of some games and leaves my victory feeling hollow and meaningless.  In FTL I can't do this (that I know of and don't want to find out if I can!) and therefore every decision counts. Is it unfair sometimes... YES, but then so is life and you've got to ride out the bad to really appreciate the good. One of my favourite games of all time was Alex the Kidd on the SEGA Master System, and I never completed it. I'm sure if I could have saved the game I would have, but don't think I would look back on the game with such fond memories.  Some people will not be able to handle investing large chunks of time in a game to have their journey irrevocably cut short by chance or stupidity. If that is you DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!! If however, you enjoy a challenge and find as much enjoyment in a good game whether you win or lose then give this one a chance. You will lose (often!!!), but when you win you know it will be worth it.  And as a parting comment, my favourite moment so far: when during a very successful run, with my ship nearly fully upgraded, fighting a particularly tough pirate ship, having repelled their boarding party through opening the airlocks and watching them suffocate against my bulkheads, we both simultaneously landed the killing blow with our beam weapons. Mutually assured destruction has never been so satisfying. And so one story ends, and another begins...",

FTL takes this familiar feeling but introduces so much randomness and unexpected events that narratives just seem to form out of each playthrough, making even the worst deaths memorable.

The RPG-like events and options render this game deeply interesting, shaping your ship, crew and gameplay more and more while you travel through the galaxy.  The objective is one and simple: reach your homeworld and defend your flagship from the rebels. How you will accomplish that, and indeed *if* you will manage to do it, depends merely on you. The enemies you will face will become harder and harder, requiring an increasing amount of thought and precision in order to cope with every situation and make the right decisions to gain the most at the least possible expense. There are numberous ways of surviving and obliterating your enemies depending on how will you shape your spacecraft: will you board the enemy ships killing their crews with good old melee fights? Deactivate the enemy oxygen systems to choke them to death? Perhaps you'll choose to kill them with an anti-bio beam emptying the ships before plundering them whole, or you'll just plainly destroy them with your lasers, missiles and teleporting bombs? That is entirely up to you, and the number of possible choices, vessels, playstyles and combination of crew species and specializations will ensure a long and repeatable, untiring experience that's worth every single penny of the price tag.",

Be the final allied warship retreating just ahead of the enemy fleet to bring vital news and a last shred of hope to the remnants of a battered army in your home system.  explore, barter, fight, assist, threaten and steal your way across a randomised sequence of procedurally generated 2D starmaps.   Fantastic realtime (pausable) 1 v 1 battles between ships where the target selection and timing of your attacks is vital to your survival. Do you buy the teleporter to allow you to board enemy ships mid-battle (and strip them down once the crew is dead) or do you get that one special weapon or vital ship upgrade that will make the mean enemy ships die faster or hurt you less?   It is a game that asks you to make choices while not being afraid to let you suffer the consequences. The random nature of some results can put you in the rare impossible situation, but for the most part this will only happen early on before you get enough upgrades/crew to have some flexibility.

FTL doesn't have gorgeous graphic or awesome battle effect,you can say everything looks pretty raw,but as long as it doesn't hurt my eyes,I'm OK with that.In fact,everything looks pretty comfortable,it would be better if the text is bigger.And the music certainly does a good job in creating a cool space atmosphere,love that cosmic feeling.Too bad it doesn't have steam achievements.

In Dwarf Fortress, you might say such and such dwarf caught a fever, went mad and killed his cat, no one cleaned it up so the miasma from the corpse made all the other dwarves vomit and the last one ran out and got trampled by an elephant.

Now, I'm not actually a fan of slow, plodding strategy games like this one, but with a price tag of $2.50, I thought I'd check out what all the fuss was about. So far, that $2.50 has been Steam Summer Sale MVP, because while FTL can be a slow, contemplative strategy game, it is also so, so much more.  The best way to describe Faster Than Light is that it is a 'Star Trek Simulator.' You are captain of a Federation starship on an mission to deliver vital information about the Rebel leaders, all the while outrunning the oncoming rebel fleet. Using your wits, weapons, and a little luck, you attempt to complete your mission of crossing the galaxy via waypoints, having many adventures along the way. During your trip you will encounter hostile alien races, dastardly space pirates, or high-tech weaponry.  An aspect of the game worth noting is that the game uses a random event generator similar to The Binding of Isaac, making sure that Faster Than Light delivers a unique game experience with every playthrough. Also worth noting is that the UI, while seeming a bit confusing at first, is actually very intuitive to understand after the basics are understood. The combat engine is done absolutely brilliantly, especially with the inclusion of the option to stop time at will and analyze the situation. FTL rewards both careful preparation as well as snap decision-making, and it makes for a very enjoyable gameplay experience. And finally, the writing and storytelling are compelling enough to make repeat playthroughs worthwhile.  I have never played a game like this before, but it latched onto my brain in a very short timespan. It is just the right balance of difficulty, storytelling, and fun, and will keep you coming back for more.",

As well the amount of ships and layouts to unlock make it so that you have so much to keep playing for. Personally I have put many hours into trying to get a single ship, and the payout is glorious when you finally do it. 8/10 Highly Recommended.  Frustration level: To say that this game is frustrating at times is a very large understatement, as at times it has made me want to throw my laptop across the room. This game is very rage inducing, but not because of something that IT did, most, if not all rage and frustration are from player mistakes. Yes it was a missle that killed you, but it was your fault for not repairing your ship in a shop. This game will force feed you humble pie, as you will begin to realize that it was not RNG or Bad luck that got you killed, but your own mistakes.  Gameplay (Mostly the combat and first impressions of mine): This game will look very bland and slow paced from a viewers perspective, having to wait for lasers to fire and watching as they only take a small block of health from the enemy each shot. However from a players POV the game is much faster paced, as not only do you have to keep track of so many systems and crew, but you also will have to send crew all around the ship to repair and activate weapons/shields/etc. The game takes a little while to get into, as for veteran players will feel bored with the beginning grind in the first sectors, while new players will feel like they are drowning in things they have to memorize and do. However once you reach about sector 4 or 5 the game picks up drastically, as the real race begins: Your ship is now running out of the fuel you had in the beginning and you are running into battles with much tougher ships, and you feel as though your next jump could be your last with every click of the mouse. This caught me by surprise my first playthrough, and I got horribly murdered by a massive enemy, and I sat back in my chair wondering what the heck happened. The other large part of the game is the Risk/Reward evaluation that you have to do at every choice. Some are obvious, turn over a crew member or attack the ship. But ones like the giant space spider station will always have random results, sometimes you get some scrap and useful items, other times your crew will die and you are left missing a person. This type of thing overshadows the entire game, making you feel cheated at times.    But with all those things put together with an amazing soundtrack this game is a wonderful thing to pick up for something to do, and you will not be dissapointed. Unless you hate roguelikes or risk/reward situations, in that case avoid this game like the plague, as most of the game is Risk/Reward. Well worth the money, and even more so when it goes on sale.",

Due to my current job and location, I can't just get on Skyrim or on an MMO for long periods of time. So a quick pick up game would be FTL. Its a great little story telling (pick your own destination) adventure in space! While many people are big into TF2's hat idea, this game I get to work and earn towards different ships that all vary in one means or another. I'm not a big fan of using robots, so I learned how to defend against people with robots. Sometimes I'm really geared to fighting with robots and automations, so we got a ship or two built for exactly that. There is plently of possible combinations of in game content within the story line that makes the whole trip of traveling across 8 expanses of space a fun and exhilirating when you got a massive enemy armada just a few steps behind you.   I really recommend this game to anyone who is into space games, adventuring, pseudo-role playing, or anything in between.",

A few of the ships seem clearly more powerful than others, but they still add challenge and variety.  No Steam Achievements is a let down, but hopefully this is fixed up in the absolutely amazing sounding FTL Advanced Edition coming in 2014.

WIth its permadeath feature, and randomized elements there is a lot of replayability. Its a pretty fun rogue-style space exploration game but for an space game, it takes place in a tiny, semi-linear universe, with limited RPG elements. The main campaign is also a bit too linear. Also, there is currently no endless mode. The game+ mode is fun since you get to fly different ship and build new crews, but while new ships are fun, and the different races are enjoyable to play with, I wish there was a bit more there.",

I like to judge games on how well they are made, how fun they are, and how much replay value they have. FTL is uncommonly well crafted, with interesting and varied writing, clever mechanics, and intuitive design. I was delighted to find that this game involves imagination as a key part of the experience, which made it pretty fun for me.

We flounder in metal wombs, our birth is a gasp for air, our reward is the choking nothingness. But I will return. I will bear witness. I will traipse across the untamed wilds of stardust, and you will know that I am beyond.",

But besides the silly rant I did, this game has a lot more depth than what it shows at first glance. and the battles are a lot more strategic then they look at first glance too. becuase depending on your loadout you'll want to strategicly take down enemy systems so you can cripple the enemy ship and take the down with minimal damage. there are plenty of different types of weapons and systems that you can get. but is getting them the best choice though. becuse if you simply just buy things you'll probably not make it. because you will need to upgrade your systems.  wow i went a lot longer then i thought. just like me playing FTL!

Expect a challenging journey, as it will be ♥♥♥♥♥-hard. It is a rogue-like and once your ship/crew are down, they are down. This is apart of its charm though. It's random every time, a new story to make for yourself each time. You'll get progressively better and eventually you will be victorious. And then you can continue doing it in either a new ship, with different crew, events, and so forth. It's just so awesome! Only £7 too! GOTY 2012.  PS.

I bought this game about a year ago, and played for about 24 hours. Recently started playing some more, and there has been an update adding more modules for ally and enemy ships. New weapons, more quests, better RNG for quest outcomes. A very plesant suprise.  This game isn't perfect. I like thinking I'm the best, and when over 95% of my runs end with a ship on fire and a dead crew. I tend to think it's too hard. I don't want the difficulty to change of course. This game just kicks my ♥♥♥ and upsets me.  The soundtrack is pretty good. I bought it, there are some good tracks in there. This is a game that should be in everyone's steam library. It's simple enough to do one run, spend an hour on it and move on for a bit. Yet it's system is deep enough to keep players engrossed for scores of hours. Even should they unlock ALL the ships and ALL the layouts for said ships. That said I'd like steam integration for unlocked ships as achievements. But that's a nit pick.  If you are slightly interested in the game. Buy it, it's a really good indie game. Arguably the best one I have played.",

This game is..... The best gamng experience i ever had by far. It is my favorite game I've spent so much time with this game (more than the 30 something hours it says (about 200 i've spent (I launched the game through mods which didnt count idk why))). It is a rouge-like realtime startegy game where manegment is everything. Such as managing your ships facilities or managing your money usage to buy more things, even managing what to do with your crewmembers. Now dont be mislead, this isn't a slowpaced have fun hold your hand kinda game. You can be killed with the second click of your mouse. The choices you make have to be split second and if you make one bad move almost always you will be immediatly killed. This game is ludacriously hard even with the amount i've spent on it i've only beaten it on hard ONCE. But, it's a good kind of hard the kind of hard that says 'yes, i killed you but you learned something new while dieing ;).' I swear this is more complex and in depth than civ (when you install mods to FTL such as Captian addition) and faster paced than cod.

Each game starts out almost exactly the same, and it takes a very long time to do simple things, like to unlock a new ship layout. I am also not a fan of games that require players to 'roll the dice.' Each time you reach a fork in the road, you choose what to do next. The problem is, both of them can hurt you, and both of them can be beneficial. I understand that for some, this creates depth and makes you act quickly (it makes the game seem more realistic, and you make decisions without knowing their consequences). I would rather use my best judgment and play a game 'correctly,' after trial-and-error and learning. You cannot truly become 'skilled' at FTL; you can only hope for the best.

There is also a medium and hard setting. Anyway, the only bad thing about it is that everything is totally random (encounters, outcome of encounters, store locations, the store's inventory). I recently bought this for my buddy also, and he's convinced that you can only win if you get lucky enough to find the better weapons. That's just not the case though. Two of the three times that I won, I thought I wouldn't stand a chance. So no, this game isn't about getting lucky at all. It's about making the best of what you have. There is always a way out of every situation. Sometimes you just have to sit back and think about it. For example, say your in the middle of a battle and several systems are offline, then you get boarded by intruders. All of your crew are fixing your ship, so your best choice might be to put a man on the door controls and introduce the boarders to the vacuum of space.  In a nutshell, it's endlessly playable, incredibly simple, and infinitely complex. You're really missing out if you don't get it. You might even be able to do what I did.

Oh sure, there are other reasons, such as comedy, education, or beauty, but that's the primary one. This game is not fun, it's frustrating. A random number generator with worse odds than any casino is not fun. No checkpoints or some other means to reduce lost time is not fun. No method of tracking how much of the story you've seen not at all or for the umpteenth time is not fun. For some people, these things are fun; give them an option. For me, they are in the way of enjoyment and make the feedback loop of desperately looking for story you haven't seen, an opportunity to get that achievement, or to get to the end without the RNG dropping 5 bomb ships in a row on you an exercise in frustration.   This game is for a people are fine with grinding over and over against random odds to a victory that is more luck than actual skill. I am not one of those people.

            "review_text": "I really, really, REALLY want to give this game a positive review because of the fact that it is very well polished and quite fun to play, but the fact is is that I simply cannot. There are some downsides to it that completely ruin this game for me and have overall forced me to write a negative review.  But let's talk about the good parts of this game first:  1. The gameplay is pretty fun. It's very unique (at least it seems that way to me) and it keeps you wanting to come back and play it over and over again just for the thrill  2. It is very polished. I have not seen nor run into what even appears to be a glitch, bug, etc.  3. Every event is randomized so you'll never have the same two adventures twice, ever. Which makes it very interesting.  Now let's talk about the bad:  1. This game is extremely difficult. Being a new player, I decided that I would play the game on easy so that I could get my bearings and learn to play the game. To this very day I still have not even come within half-way of the first boss. Let me repeat myself: I have played this game on EASY difficulty SEVEN times and haven't even completed HALFWAY to the FIRST boss. Now I've completed some difficult games in my lifetime (The Impossible Game, I Am Toast, QWOP, etc.) and I have never, ever run into a game that is more frustrating than this one.  2. Remember when I said that events in this game were randomized, well I wasn't lying. EVERYTHING in this game is randomized, and it doesn't matter what level you are or where you are in the game, you will either run into a very easy challenge that you can breeze by at the beginning of the game, or you can run into a very difficult challenge that will show absolutely no mercy no matter what level you are. For example, I had a crew of four people, I took them to a planet that apparently had a pirate near it, so the pirate attacked and we easily destroyed his ship and took his wares. We then travel to the next planet where a pirate mothership literally fires four rockets at us at the same time and sets half my ship on fire will simultaneously destroying my oxygen supply and ultimately suffocating everyone on board to their demise: this happend right after the fourth planet I visited...on easy. DISCLAIMER: I love challenging games, but when you run into something that isn't even fair and you lose hours upon houirs of work because of one stroke of bad luck, it kind of ruins a game for you.  3. Unlocking things in this game is a b*tch. I read that you can unlock new ships by visiting planets and helping other people, or by defeating the boss, but when you can't reach the boss and you can't find any of the planets that have the new ships on them, it kinda defeats the purpose of even having unlockable ships. Basically you're stuck with the default ship for a really long time, unless you get lucky which is basically what this whole game is about.  ALL-IN-ALL  I would recommend this game to someone that likes a challenge and likes managing their own ship. I would NOT recommend this game to someone that doesn't like to put lots of hours into a game and then lose all of it in one fell swoop, or someone that get's angry or frustrated very easily, or someone that simply likes to play video games but hates starting things over and over and over again. Trust me, this game isn't bad, but unfortunately Steam won't allow neutral reviews, and I'm leaning more towards negative anyways. ",

Even on easy difficulty the game is notorious for absurd surprise attacks and seemingly arbitrary changes to the established rules.  The constant pressure of being pursued leaves you with never a moment to explore, regroup, or restock. This would be fine were it not made possible by the use of one impossible sci-fi trope (warping about willy-nilly from star to star) while countless others are omitted. This makes a novel premise for a story, but it's exhausting in a game where dying means starting over from the beginning.  It's this last element which makes me smirk a bit at this game's marketing as a roguelike. There's no going back up the steps, hurriedly reading a scroll, stopping back in town, or spotting a hopeless situation down the hallway and finding an alternate route. A good roguelike can do without some of these things, but leaving out every one of them except permadeath and bad luck launches this game out of that category entirely, and lands it squarely in the realm of Oregon Trail and the most obnoxious Choose Your Own Adventure fare.  Buy it for the beautiful soundtrack, which is about as good as Dustforce and maybe better. Better yet, just buy the soundtrack.",

I jumped into a nebula with no sensors and tried to destroy a Slug war-bang-killa-420-no-scope vessel and I won but all that was left was Matthieu. Right before the endgame I got caught by a massive bomber and I had to watch this hero suffocate to death. He was locked inside the brig, enemies just banging away at the door.

I don't recall now exactly how I had heard of the game in the first place, however I do distinctly recall knowing that this was a game I could totally end up playing long term. And lo and behold that has generally been the case.  Now the premise of Subset Games FTL: Faster Than Light is more or less a typical space opera sort of thing, you are a lone ship, fleeing a great and terrible army in your spaceship towards some sort of base at the end of the map, at which time you give the secret to a military hub only to have them tell you that they don't want it and that it's your job to destroy the enemy’s secret weapon anyway. One would wonder why they didn't just tell you that at the beginning of the map, but regardless you can still take all that time traveling inexorably rightwards to build up your ship with numerous types of weapons and sundry to make the job slightly less impossible when it happens. The game is largely text based, with most of the game's story communicated via dialog boxes, and combat more of a point and click adventure game than a space battle, but the fighting still manages to keep you entertained, not dragging on too long to be annoying, but not so short as to seem to be tacked on at the end. The game is very roguelike, with each star system having the possibility of throwing you a bone with some nice loot, or a pitched battle with a pirate battlecruiser. You definitely can feel the hand of the random number gods all over this game, and in many circumstances you will most certainly find yourself backed into a corner regardless of having done everything right. But the game does take great pains to not make the game seem completely unfair, and even the longest streak of bad luck really just seems more like you didn't do enough to make it work than any sort of random chance. In the end, as far as roguelike games go, I can safely say this is probably my second favorite, blending strategy and gameplay in a simple game that you can jump right into, get blown apart a few times, then feel like you've learned something, only to get blown apart a few times anyway. Buy.  Game’s Fate: Kept. This game works brilliantly as a quick and easy time waster and a long and drawn out roguelike.

It's difficult to explain what the game is all about, but essentialy it's randomly generated space adventure, where your quest is to run away from the rebel fleet, exploring randomly generated maps and evens, fighting randomly generated enemies in a very enjoyable turn-based combat system, use scrap you recover to upgrade your ship, buy new weapons and equipment and at the end (hopefuly) destroy the big-♥♥♥ battleship. It's a game that will kill you a lot, make you feel like you've been screwed, and don't offer any leeway. But it still makes you come back, still wants you to play one more round, try one more time to destroy that overpowered piece of *** that you must fight at the end of the game.

One moment I'm flawlessly annihilating the sophisticated Rebel fleet with my advanced weapons and shields, and the next everything is all flames and destruction due to a nearby star and a lowly pirate. And yet these losses make me feel like I'm the captain of an awesome space vessel in a sci-fi movie like Star Trek, commanding my crew, managing my systems, and suffering the consequences of bad decisions. While your choices in events can be rather unpredictable, you also make many decisions in combat which determine the fate of your crew and your ship. This is one game I just keep coming back to.  Pros: -Runs on my junkheap of a laptop without any effects whatsoever. -LOADS of replay value and variety. -Advanced content for when the original version gets old. -Sightseeing the galaxy while being chased by an infinite, bloodthirsty Rebel fleet. -Doesn't require a lot of dedication to be fun. -Upgradeable ship and mini XP system for the crew.  Cons (But not really): -Enemies are sometimes ridiculously overpowered (but hey, that's part of space fighting). -Makes me press the space bar when I play other games in an attempt to pause. -Effective if you're trying to procrastinate. -Still can't get through the first few sectors on Normal. Honestly, the only real issue I have with the game is the random outcomes of some events. This may not be a problem for other people, but I'm personally frustrated sometimes when I make the same decision in an event twice with the result varying in extremes from getting some valuable scrap to losing a key crewmember. But, again, that's part of adventuring in the unknowns of space.  FTL is worth your money and your life!",

You are essentially trying to survive against all odds in a hostile area in space, trying to get back to the Federation. It's supposed to be very hard. But when I switched to Easy, it was pretty easy until you fight the Rebel Flagship, then the difficulty spikes so hard it has an overhang.

I saw TotalBiscuit's review and found myself rather interested in a game where you man a ship and travel across the galaxy fighting rebels and getting cool new weapons to fight rebels with. The game's not complex by any means but that isn't a bad thing. I'd say it's quite accessable to most people which definitely works in its favor. Battles take place in real time but if you want to plot out things with a bit more time then you'll enjoy the fact that the game's pause actually just pauses the action, still letting you aim guns and plan your next move. There's a wide variety of ships to pilot (most needing to be unlocked through various methods and playthroughs) that keeps the game from getting dull, and most of your campaigns will average about an hour or so depending on your difficulty setting and amount of luck.  I love FTL and can wholeheartedly recommend it for anyone who's on the fence about buying it. Worth $10, especially since the free update that added quite a bit of content into the game. If you're really stingy you can always get it cheaper on sale, but I'd say I got my money's worth on this one.",

Take your ship with its small crew and meager weaponry, and make critical decisions, attempting to survive pirates, pulsars, and the occasional giant spider, all with a deadly rebel armada right at your heels. Do you fight, or run? Is it worth the reward, or will you risk losing crew? Do you take down that rebel ship, even though it's bringing food to innocent refugees? Take the moral high ground, at the risk of failing your critical mission?  Surprisingly, FTL is quite extensive in the weapons and systems your spaceship can obtain. What flavour of laser gun do you like? Multi-shot, quick charging, slicing beam or even chaingun style? Or do you want disruptive Ion guns? Shield ignoring Missiles and Bombs? Maybe swarm the ship with attack drones, or even ignoring all that and teleporting over a boarding crew and mind controling the enemy.  Small hint: Learn how and when to use each of them!  I've played big production space-sim, rts, or turn-based games that have less gameplay options than this simple top-down 2D rogue game.  All that said, it is also unforgiving in it's gameplay, at a level where one might bandy the words 'Nintendo Hard' or 'Ninja Gaiden on Hard Mode'. There's a learning curve in this game, and it goes beyond knowing the stats of your weapons, crew or enemies. You can't plow through the game picking a single tactic or weapon combo and expect to win in the slightest. The game gives you a wide array of tools, and expects you to use them all in varied combinations to win. Learning to recognize the combos your playthrough is giving you, and responding to the events and enemies you find, or picking the path that best fits your combo or situation, really is how to play this game on a winning level.  Seriously, do not expect to breeze through this game like most other current games. Expect failure in your learning process, and learn to love the 'Aha!' moments, where you suddenly realize a new level to the game and can't wait to test it out on your next playthrough.",

I suppose you could say that if you like games like Dark Souls, where the goal is to become absolutely livid but not enough to punch your monitor, then this game is definitely for you.  The game is simple enough to learn, but just in case, there is a Tutorial.  The game is very random. Sometimes, everything would be great. Sometimes, you get screwed in a few sectors.  Graphics are adequate for the kind of game. Sound is 'meh' but okay enough.  It would be nice to have more than just open space, near the sun, and near asteroids. How about near blackholes, where you either jump or kill your opponents after a certain amount of time before you and your opponent gets sucked into the blackhole. How about getting supporting fire from nearby allies in ally space if you meet certain requirements? Say you have an Engi, you are fighting rebels, and you are in Engi space, you would get fire support to help you kill rebel ships.  Also, more customization options when you pick your ship from the Hangar would be nice too. They should give players scrap to buy their own weapons, drones, crew, systems, and augments.  It would also be nice to get scrap every time you move to a different beacon. Think of it as experience points as you explore the sector and reward you for not dying.  If I were to score it, I'd give it a 7/10. That's pretty generous, considering that I'm not really into all this dying ad-nauseum rogues and rogue-likes/rogue-lites. The only thing that really piqued my interest was the whole space ship sim, but this game delivered more than I was expecting, and I kinda liked it. I like Star Trek - no, not the one with the 'Force.'",

The games combat consists of real time battle in which you target differct subsystems and rooms on the opponents vessel to cripple their attack, defence, or utility such as taking out their oxygen room, medbay, or control room. While the combat is fairly in depth the crew combat is shallow with little to it other than some species have more health and others atack faster.

It is not an easy game, and I spent something like 30 hours on FTL before finishing it even on the easy difficulty setting (which is not even remotely easy). The developers have spoken about the difficulty in FTL before, describing it as a 'suicide mission' where you are the captain yelling at mechanics to get the engines back online. That is very much what FTL feels like: it is a frantic struggle for survival.  In practice, the game operates a lot like a board game, which makes sense since it was inspired by a board game called Battlestations. If you enjoy strategy games with a high degree of difficulty, it's hard to beat FTL. One really nice thing about this game in particular is that it will run on any kind of setup you might have: PC or Mac, and there's even an iPad version available.",

The game is challenging and frustrating, (might rage quit a few times) but satisfying, I've suck almost 50 hours into this game at the time of writing the review.   It is in a retro style, but it's crisp and clean, and the animations are good, there are no bugs (at least that I've come accross), the music is fantastic and fits perfectly. I don't think anyone would regret owning this game.  The game isn't for everyone, if you don't like space/scifi games at all, nor anyone that has big anger issues because it is chellenging and if you die you die, you start again from the beginning (hence the occassional rage quit), you can save but only save+quit, in other words it's a survival game, and if you don't like survival games in any shape or form then you might struggle to enjoy this. That said, it's worth giving it a go, because while it's a relatively simple game, easy to learn/get into, it has been done very well, and you might just enjoy it even if it's not your usual fare.",

            "review_text": "I've dumped a lot of time in this game, both on tablet, drm free versions of it, and every now and again the steam copy. It's about a ship captained by you taking information across a hostile and unfriendly galaxy to your superiors so you can help stop a coup by a large and well armed military faction of the fractured government you owe your allegiance to.  In practical terms, this is a rogue-like. You have a ship and crew which is outfitted with the minimum equipment at the start of the game. You take the ship across a randomly generated sector, exploring, accruing more upgrades and crew members until you reach the sector exit. You choose which of two sectors you will go to and then repeat the same thing again with harder enemies further stressing your resources. You are being pursued by a large fleet which will gradually occupy more and more of the sector so planning out your route to the exit and what side paths you can explore is important to staying in good shape. Once you reach the final sector you face a boss battle in the form of a large, nasty ship, with three forms revealed as you destroy it.  Combat is real time with you choosing where power will be allotted, what weapons to use, where weapons will target on the opposing ship, what stations your crew will man and what repairs they do on damaged systems. As you gain scrap, the currency in the game, you can upgrade your ship's abilities, buy new weapons and systems at shops, and repair your damaged ship. It's important to balance risk/reward so you don't waste too much scrap on repairs. It also keeps you thinking if the next jump is worth it, can you explore, or should you run to the exit before the fleet catches up to you.  Not every game presented is winnable, particularly in the harder difficulties. I don't see this as a problem, part of the appeal is to see how far you can make it if you can't complete the game and to see how well you can do with what resources you have at your disposal. There are lower difficulties for more casual players to enjoy the game and harder difficulties for people who think the game is too easy or just want to face a tough challenge.  The easy to understand and accessible mechanics of the game combined with the amount of depth, in the events, resource management, and builds you can make for your ship make this a wonderful game and probably one of the best games on Steam and on Tablets - if you have one.",

While your choices in events can be rather unpredictable, you also make many decisions in combat which determine the fate of your crew and your ship. This is one game I just keep coming back to.  Pros: -Runs on my junkheap of a laptop without any effects whatsoever. -LOADS of replay value and variety. -Advanced content for when the original version gets old. -Sightseeing the galaxy while being chased by an infinite, bloodthirsty Rebel fleet. -Doesn't require a lot of dedication to be fun. -Upgradeable ship and mini XP system for the crew.  Cons (But not really): -Enemies are sometimes ridiculously overpowered (but hey, that's part of space fighting). -Makes me press the space bar when I play other games in an attempt to pause. -Effective if you're trying to procrastinate. -Still can't get through the first few sectors on Normal. Honestly, the only real issue I have with the game is the random outcomes of some events. This may not be a problem for other people, but I'm personally frustrated sometimes when I make the same decision in an event twice with the result varying in extremes from getting some valuable scrap to losing a key crewmember. But, again, that's part of adventuring in the unknowns of space.  FTL is worth your money and your life!",

The game is challenging and frustrating, (might rage quit a few times) but satisfying, I've suck almost 50 hours into this game at the time of writing the review.   It is in a retro style, but it's crisp and clean, and the animations are good, there are no bugs (at least that I've come accross), the music is fantastic and fits perfectly. I don't think anyone would regret owning this game.  The game isn't for everyone, if you don't like space/scifi games at all, nor anyone that has big anger issues because it is chellenging and if you die you die, you start again from the beginning (hence the occassional rage quit), you can save but only save+quit, in other words it's a survival game, and if you don't like survival games in any shape or form then you might struggle to enjoy this. That said, it's worth giving it a go, because while it's a relatively simple game, easy to learn/get into, it has been done very well, and you might just enjoy it even if it's not your usual fare.",

The game can be started in one of 10 different ships, each of which has up to 3 different configurations with different starting weapons, crew and internal room layout. Starting ships/configurations have to be unlocked first.  In game, there is a lot of randomness – if you are unlucky, even if you make it to the final fight, you won't be able to defeat the boss. You collect weapons/items/ammo, fight in random encounters, do random quests, encounter space stations where you can trade the items or hire extra crew of different species. During the fight, you have to balance the energy usage between different systems, move the crew around to fix breaches, extinguish fires or fight enemy intruders on board. You can also open external doors in your ship to suck out the oxygen to deal with fire or intruders. At the same time you have to use your weapons such as cannons, laser beams, rockets, drones, boarding drones to destroy enemy ship or kill all their crew – you can even teleport your own crew on board of enemy ship. It's really helpful that you can pause the game at any time to plan your actions. I forgot to add that you crew gets experience with everything they do and you can upgrade most of the systems that you have installed in the rooms of your ship.  Nice music is an extra addition.  For the price of about £7.00 the game offers tens of hours of fun. It is definitely a good deal.  Finally, I don't remember seeing any bugs in the game, it's quite well polished.",

This is my first review and I felt I had to sing the praises some more because I've found myself playing little else on steam for the past two months. I was getting frustrated at first when after 10 playthroughs on normal and only ever getting to the final boss to get wreckt by it in the first or second stage. By then I had unlocked through some luck and false starts 3 other ships than the first one. After attempt 10 (That was around 15- 20 hours lost to space dust) I cranked it down to easy to at least beat the game once. After that I spiraled through the games list of ships and have now beaten both A and B ships of everything on the list (and holy crap theres quite a few of them). Then I went back and started on Normal again to get ready for the ♥♥♥♥ to come back. But it didn't come as hard as I was expecting. Sure my poor Mantis ship suffered defeat at the hands of freaking Rockman missles, but that didn't stop me from enjoying the fact that I had pretty much taken them with me with only a single Rockman left hiding in the cockpit with 4 of my Mantis party going to town on his weapons (so sad they didn't make it in time). But it was that unforgetable moment that I thought like a Mantis for a few moments and at the cost of my safety, I took those ****ers down. So it's more on the moment to moment events that makes this game good. Wish there was another one to sink my teeth into, but until then I'll continue my one ship tour to save a galaxy from the scourge of what I can only assume is something akin to the opposite of Star Wars Rebels Vs.

The music is pretty good as well but I doubt I'd throw down the $4 for the OST DLC.  Basically, you jump from star system to star system with the general goal of outrunning the Rebel fleet and making it to the Federation base on the other side of the galaxy where they're regrouping, as you have some important intel. At each star system you're presented with a random event that are either text-based choices or battle sequences; you're randomly awarded weapons, ship systems, fuel, missiles, drones, scrap (the game's currency of sorts) and even new crew members to help get your ship in tip-top shape for the final battle at the end of the game.",

Each point you jump to has a different event, be it fighting a scout, helping a station, battling slavers, theres lots that can happen, then when at the end of the sector, you jump to the next.  This game, has unlockable ships too, which can be done by doing various things through playthroughs, naturally, some are harder to get than others, and the randomness of events only makes this fact even harder.

For example, the Ion weapon does not cause damage but can disrupt an enemy system. Target their shields and let a Combat Droid damage their ship.  This game does play hard ball, even in Easy mode. Your choices feel like it can be 50/50. Should you help the ailing ship? Do so and you can be ambushed. While I do not mind this, what I do mind are the other choices that may cost me a member of my crew in this game. Replacing them is often difficult. The biggest draw for me with this game is you constantly want to see what the next star system has. Will it be a pirate vessel waiting to attack you? Will it be an ailing Federation ship that has a person inside who will join your crew? You constantly want to keep playing to see.  ",

            "review_text": "Overall, it's a solid game and worth the price.  To give a brief synopsis: FTL is a game where you have full control over a starship and its crew. Your goal is to get your ship from one side of the galaxy to the other by warp-jumping through countless star clusters which are sub-divided into individual star systems. Each time you jump into a new system, you are given a random encounter. Usually its a straight-forward combat encounter. An example of a more interesting encounter would be finding a damaged space-station and making the decision, as captain, whether to ignore them and continue with your important objective, or send your crew into a life-threatening situation. In those cases its up to chance whether you are rewarded for succeeding, or you may fail and lose some of your crew. You also must maintain your supplies while collecting scrap which is effectively currency to upgrade your ship.  I agree with some of the criticism that the random nature of encounters can lead to frustrating defeats after an otherwise near-perfect game. There is also a low skill ceiling because of this. On many occasions your level of success is gauged by the roll of the dice rather than your skill.  At the same time, I also appreciated this because, as in Star Trek, a starship captain must face a no-win scenario at times. It some ways, this element makes the game feel more gritty and realistic. More unpredictable. I like that element in games. I would have appreciated more of a balance between skill and randomness. Maybe remove the pause feature and force the player to develop twitch reactions and have certain actions on the ship have a more tangible effect.  Another issue is the repetitiveness. Around the time I write this review, about 8 hours, I feel I'm beginning to see encounters repeating. Combat is also becoming a chore.  The low skill ceiling and eventual repetitiveness hold this game back from achieving longevity.  Still, I feel there is a minimum solid 6-8 hours of very addictive and fun entertainment to be had here. I highly recommend it to star trek fans or anyone who likes captain-simulators. I give it a 7/10.",

The 'new game' is in quotes because you do maintain any unlocked ship types, achievements, etc. So watch how you can unlock new ships and do that and don't care that you get cruched before the Last Stand.  Second, it is frustrating to feel like you've finally gotten the crew and weapons you want and then, BAM, you get slaughtered and have to go back to the Hanger and start again. If you can deal that that, per the first point, you'll like the game.  Third, you can't run from a fight that you can tell up front you're not going to do well in. BUT if you can survive long enough for your FTL to charge, then you can jump out. Though perhaps out of the frying pan and into the fire. Still, better than an endless stalemate or outright losing.  Fourth, you will have to defeat the boss ship in the Last Stand at some point. To unlock the third kind of ship, that's the only option.

            "review_text": "So I'm a 'try before you buy' type of guy. You know what I mean.  This is one of those games that I tried, bought, then bought again. And again. And again. Because I looked at my 'time played' statistic in game and realized I was getting close to 100 hours without giving the developers a dime. So I gave the devs money for copies for myself and several friends who I knew would like it. Whenever a friend has some money and is looking for a game to play, it's one of the games I recommend.  Now, how's it play? Well, it's a roguelike (or as the devs have called it, a 'rogue-lite'). There's a set series of events you can run into (which is large) and a semi-randomly generated layout of sectors (which is itself part of a semi-randomly generated layout of systems). There are a  lot  of different events you can run into. As I said, I had around 85 hours of gameplay in this game before I bought it on steam. At the time of this review, I have 47 on steam. When they added Advanced Edition, I still hadn't run into all of the vanilla events. I still haven't run into a few (namely the crystal sector ones, which if you buy the game, you'll learn to hate the elusiveness of), never mind all of the ones AE added.  A fair splash of the events are neutral. A small selection of them are outright-beneficial (sometimes if you're  really  lucky, and the gods smile on you, you can even find a random weapon floating around in space, but don't count on it). A lot of them are hostile encounters. What's a wonderful touch are the 'blue options' that can show up if you meet certain requirements. Have some powerful weapons and a pirate is trying to extort you? Flash them at him and make him turn tail without a fight. Unsure if an empty station is free loot or a dangerous trap? Use your advanced scanners to scout the way instead of going in blind. Sometimes there will be multiple blue options, some with better results: The station with defective turrets would prefer you EMP'd them to repair them than blast them outright, afterall.  The combat itseslf is a beautiful blend of frustrating, rewarding and deep. On the surface, it's pause-based realtime combat. Your weapons charge up, fire at their targets, pop their shields, then continue on their merry way to their systems. Missiles require ammo and penetrate shields, beams can hit multiple systems but can't get through shields at all, lasers can usually fire multiple rounds, but have to hit each layer of shield before they can go through. But there are dozens of small ways that the system gets complicated: Boarding the ship (or using mind control systems) can have fights breaking out between crew even as the lasers and missiles are flying. If you're confident in your shield-operator's skills, you can drop the shields to let a single laser get through to give them time to recharge and stop the more-devestating beam weapon. Light a fire in their hold and keep them occupied, and you could starve them of oxygen and pick their intact ship clean, netting better loot than if you destroyed it completely. Combined with environmental hazards like asteroid belts and solar flares, you'll eventually come to the point where you're deciding if it's worth sticking around to fight, or if maybe you should jump out and leave the crew that boarded the enemy ship behind.  The combat also relies on a power-to-systems setup that will quickly make you feel like Captain Picard (presumably, I never watched much Star Trek). Systems have a maximum power capacity, but so does your reactor. An oft-overlooked mechanic in the game is that the difficulty is scaled based on your reactor's total power output, rather than your system strength. Which is to say: You're meant to be unable to play the game with full power to all systems (save for towards the very end). Do you push more power into your shields, forcing you to deactivate one of your lasers? Or do you maximize power to your engines, in the hopes of dodging their intimidating missiles? Maybe you're better off battering down their shields and taking out their systems before they can retaliate. In practice, you'll have to use a mixture of all of these if you want to make it to fight the rebel flagship at the end (and good luck once you get there, for the record).  There's a pretty wide variety of ships in the game, too. Advanced Edition changed the unlock system to be slightly more forgiving, by beating the game with one ship you unlock the next one (which isn't necessarily an easy task), you can also unlock them with specific event-based quests (which was previously the only method, and is also not an easy task). The game does a good job of making each ship feel unique. They each start with varied system capacities, weapon/drone layouts and crew, and though they can (and depending on RNG, will) fill the role of nearly any form of ship, they each tailor themselves to a specific style of play. The mantis ships are all clearly designed for a boarding approach over weapons, whereas the engi ships are meant to focus primarily on drones. The federation cruiser soaks up punishment until it can unleash its artillery beam and annihilate the enemy, and so on. The different races/crew each have specific benefits (even humans, the normally boring-template race, get a bonus in that they learn skills faster), and though you may start up with a sparse selection, you can theoretically attain any crew on any ship (though some are harder to get than others, such as the elusive Lanius).  Because of the random nature of the game, sometimes the game will throw up moments that can make you tear your hair out, an hourlong run ended because of an opponent whose shields you couldn't quite break through who wore you down before you realized you should've jumped away, or a fire breaking out in your engine (or life support) room from a missile battery that refused to let up for just a few seconds. There's a reason that until AE, the game only had 'Easy' and 'Normal' difficulties.  But similarly, the random nature of the game can make it  that much more rewarding  when you overcome ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t odds and emerge victorious despite everything that stood in your way. Two sectors without a chance to repair, a dozen fights with automated scouts that dropped next to nothing for loot, slugmen trying to swindle you out of your hard-won scrap and trying to burn your crew alive for saying no? It's all just a day in the life of a Federation pilot on the run from rebel scum.",

As you adventure you will get new items from shops or events or enemy's, but there are also other items that aren't weapons like augmentations and drones. The three main currency of items are, Scrap (money), Missiles (Ammunition for certain weapons) and Drone Parts (to deploy drones).  Pros: Has a lot of variation in events. Has very well made mechanics. Has a lot of little mechanics that work well together. Graphics are decent with an interesting style. The music is very good and I think fits the game very well.   Cons: It's hard to explain how the game works which can make it hard to get someone into until they play it. The story is not great and very small if your looking for a good story.   Other (difficulty): The difficulty of the game is something I can't say is a pro or con. It's pretty easy if you are good with the ship you are using until the final boos, I find the final boss to not just be a difficulty curve but a 90 degree line upward. This is a hard thing to pin point as a problem and I personally think that it should be spread through the game a little more instead of just the odd fight and the final boss.",

            "review_text": "So I'm a 'try before you buy' type of guy. You know what I mean.  This is one of those games that I tried, bought, then bought again. And again. And again. Because I looked at my 'time played' statistic in game and realized I was getting close to 100 hours without giving the developers a dime. So I gave the devs money for copies for myself and several friends who I knew would like it. Whenever a friend has some money and is looking for a game to play, it's one of the games I recommend.  Now, how's it play? Well, it's a roguelike (or as the devs have called it, a 'rogue-lite'). There's a set series of events you can run into (which is large) and a semi-randomly generated layout of sectors (which is itself part of a semi-randomly generated layout of systems). There are a  lot  of different events you can run into. As I said, I had around 85 hours of gameplay in this game before I bought it on steam. At the time of this review, I have 47 on steam. When they added Advanced Edition, I still hadn't run into all of the vanilla events. I still haven't run into a few (namely the crystal sector ones, which if you buy the game, you'll learn to hate the elusiveness of), never mind all of the ones AE added.  A fair splash of the events are neutral. A small selection of them are outright-beneficial (sometimes if you're  really  lucky, and the gods smile on you, you can even find a random weapon floating around in space, but don't count on it). A lot of them are hostile encounters. What's a wonderful touch are the 'blue options' that can show up if you meet certain requirements. Have some powerful weapons and a pirate is trying to extort you? Flash them at him and make him turn tail without a fight. Unsure if an empty station is free loot or a dangerous trap? Use your advanced scanners to scout the way instead of going in blind. Sometimes there will be multiple blue options, some with better results: The station with defective turrets would prefer you EMP'd them to repair them than blast them outright, afterall.  The combat itseslf is a beautiful blend of frustrating, rewarding and deep. On the surface, it's pause-based realtime combat. Your weapons charge up, fire at their targets, pop their shields, then continue on their merry way to their systems. Missiles require ammo and penetrate shields, beams can hit multiple systems but can't get through shields at all, lasers can usually fire multiple rounds, but have to hit each layer of shield before they can go through. But there are dozens of small ways that the system gets complicated: Boarding the ship (or using mind control systems) can have fights breaking out between crew even as the lasers and missiles are flying. If you're confident in your shield-operator's skills, you can drop the shields to let a single laser get through to give them time to recharge and stop the more-devestating beam weapon. Light a fire in their hold and keep them occupied, and you could starve them of oxygen and pick their intact ship clean, netting better loot than if you destroyed it completely. Combined with environmental hazards like asteroid belts and solar flares, you'll eventually come to the point where you're deciding if it's worth sticking around to fight, or if maybe you should jump out and leave the crew that boarded the enemy ship behind.  The combat also relies on a power-to-systems setup that will quickly make you feel like Captain Picard (presumably, I never watched much Star Trek). Systems have a maximum power capacity, but so does your reactor. An oft-overlooked mechanic in the game is that the difficulty is scaled based on your reactor's total power output, rather than your system strength. Which is to say: You're meant to be unable to play the game with full power to all systems (save for towards the very end). Do you push more power into your shields, forcing you to deactivate one of your lasers? Or do you maximize power to your engines, in the hopes of dodging their intimidating missiles? Maybe you're better off battering down their shields and taking out their systems before they can retaliate. In practice, you'll have to use a mixture of all of these if you want to make it to fight the rebel flagship at the end (and good luck once you get there, for the record).  There's a pretty wide variety of ships in the game, too. Advanced Edition changed the unlock system to be slightly more forgiving, by beating the game with one ship you unlock the next one (which isn't necessarily an easy task), you can also unlock them with specific event-based quests (which was previously the only method, and is also not an easy task). The game does a good job of making each ship feel unique. They each start with varied system capacities, weapon/drone layouts and crew, and though they can (and depending on RNG, will) fill the role of nearly any form of ship, they each tailor themselves to a specific style of play. The mantis ships are all clearly designed for a boarding approach over weapons, whereas the engi ships are meant to focus primarily on drones. The federation cruiser soaks up punishment until it can unleash its artillery beam and annihilate the enemy, and so on. The different races/crew each have specific benefits (even humans, the normally boring-template race, get a bonus in that they learn skills faster), and though you may start up with a sparse selection, you can theoretically attain any crew on any ship (though some are harder to get than others, such as the elusive Lanius).  Because of the random nature of the game, sometimes the game will throw up moments that can make you tear your hair out, an hourlong run ended because of an opponent whose shields you couldn't quite break through who wore you down before you realized you should've jumped away, or a fire breaking out in your engine (or life support) room from a missile battery that refused to let up for just a few seconds. There's a reason that until AE, the game only had 'Easy' and 'Normal' difficulties.  But similarly, the random nature of the game can make it  that much more rewarding  when you overcome ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t odds and emerge victorious despite everything that stood in your way. Two sectors without a chance to repair, a dozen fights with automated scouts that dropped next to nothing for loot, slugmen trying to swindle you out of your hard-won scrap and trying to burn your crew alive for saying no? It's all just a day in the life of a Federation pilot on the run from rebel scum.",

You then rush, through the dark, to the super healing medbay. First the Oxygen dies. Then The Shields, Then The engines. You hear an explosion. The enemy ship was destroyed. Then the cockpit is destroyed. The cameras are destroyed, then the drones, then the weapons, the doors next, and the artillery beams follow. The mantis creatures rush into the medbay. You kill one, then another, then another. They are all dead. You then fix, one by one, the Oxygen,the weapons, the shields, etc. You approach the cockpit and reach the final sector.

The story that is somewhere in the background is not that significant - as the captain of a space ship you are tasked with breaking through several sectors in a mostly hostile galaxy and carry vital intelligence to its destination. Along the journey you build up your vessel, expand its weaponry and systems, harden your crew and recruit new members - everything to be prepared for the more and more difficult challenges.  The most entertaining thing for me is the micro-managment in this game. During encounters with several types of hostile ships you have to decide real-time where to assign your crew members, to which systems allocate the energy to and which parts of the enemy's ship should be targeted and with what. This very often turns into hard live-or-die choices, like for example: should I send the crew to repell the boarding party that just teleported in or maybe have them fixing the hull damage that is sucking air out of the ship, or put out a fire that is ravaging the engine room? Usually you end up doing everything at the same time, constantly switching your resources from offense to defense. Even if at some point you'll strike a steady balance and think that you are prepared for anything, you will always find that one enemy ship that employs tactics you are not prepared to counter and will have to 'make do'.  The simple design of Faster Than Light packs a ton of features, so if you value content over looks you will be most pleased. Trekkies, Star Wars and other space-franchise fans will also feel at home. Since each playthrough has a different randomly generated galaxy, with different directions, enemies and encounters the replay value is extremely high. Be prepared to get addicted!",

The visuals are very clean 2D sprites, that remind me of some of the better flash games of the early 2000's very colorful and well fitted to the sci-fi theme of the game. You really couldn't ask for more.  The gameplay itself is divided into a few parts, first there is the star map. A nicely shown overmap to guide you through your adventure and give you a bit of a heads up onto what will kill you in the future. This is procedurally generated and keeps the game feeling fresh. Next is your ship menu, here you will be able to designate which room your various crew members will die in. Speaking of death, oh it happens in so many wonderous ways. Most common will be suffocation, followed by burning to death and being left in the vacuum of space after your ship is destroyed. If you are lucky your crew will die in glorius combat fighting the giant Mantis people or the Rock people or maybe just to another human. Ship to ship combat is managed through a very nice real time but pausable battle system, this keeps the already intense gameplay from becoming overwhelming.   The sound is also very well done the ambient music when not in combat is soothing and the various themes you hear while encountering the various adversaries and alien spieces are all very nice. If you enjoy listening to 'video game' music I suggest buying the soundtrack to listen to at your leisure.  Finally the flaws, the game can get stale after a couple dozen attempted playthroughs, there are many items in the game to obtain but few have a definitive impact as much as your starting equiment. The RNG can leave you high and dry with an unwinnable campaign from the start.   All in all though I will say this, FTL: Faster Than Light is an exceptional game in all regards and I only wish there were more games that achieved this quality. The development team obviously love this game and it shows in the final product.",
