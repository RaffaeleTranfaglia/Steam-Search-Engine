            "review_text": "For 10 USD this game is not worth it at all! This should be a free to play game. The developers has abandoned this as i have seen they released a new sim 'Airport Firefighters' It Even has the same price!  The start of the game was the most annoying part so far. It starts you off in deutsch and you have to follow this guy around as a tutorial. I think it lasted for like 30 minutes. There is so many bugs and so many missing settings! You have to complete your shift to be able to save the game. A shitf lasts 24 hours and i had the days on long with i didnt quite get in the start. I sat there for 1 hour waiting to be able to save...   Whatever you do dont buy this game as its 100% abandoned. They have started a new game completely like this one! For the same price!",
