            "review_text": "Loved this hidden gem on the 360. And I love it here. Definitely worth the price of admission if you're a sucker for Robotron-inspired games like I am.  The arcade mode is just that. You take on wave after wave of enemies until you die. Check the video, and you get the idea.  In the 'campaign' mode (there is 0 story), you get to upgrade your robot with credits you pick up from killing enemies. This is fun, but goes by very quickly. If you die, you get to keep the credits you earned for the run making it just a matter of time before you'll be fully maxed out. I would have preferred only keeping the credits that you earned upon completing the level, but I also realize that it probably would have been a huge pain to try and balance properly.  Also, the alternating firing in campaign mode makes for some interesting strategic positioning being required during gameplay.  The most important thing to point out here: This is through-and-through an actual twin-stick shooter. That is, you most definitely want to use a game controller for the 'twin sticks'. Using a mouse for this particular game just isn't quite right. It would be like playing Quake with a game pad, Street Fighter with keyboard, or driving with your feet.",

Pretty simple top-down wave shooter, nothing more than that though super bare-bones game, would not recommend paying for this game definetly not worth the money.",
