            "review_text": "The biggest issue the game has are the dialogue choices.  After the character creation, every dialogue option is: Joking, Friendly, or Forceful. (and sometimes 'romance' &gt;_&gt;) These descriptions are simply not enough to make the choice you want. It forces you to either pick dialogue options you don't like, or (if you're like me) just save before every single choice and then try all three answers to see which one you like most.   Update: I've learned that you can use the mousewheel to scroll back to the dialogue choices, and choose a different option. This makes figuring out the dialogue choice less tedious, although it still is annoying to have to select and then back out of each option.  To give you an idea of how bad these dialogue options are, lets do a scenario. Person A Is arguing with Person B. They turn to you for your thoughts. Your options are Joking, Friendly, or Forceful as always, without giving you any indication of who those options side with. It's only through saving and reloading 3 times that you learn Joking and Forceful side with Person A, and Friendly sides with Person B. Very tedious. Very annoying.   Now imagine the above scenario for Every. Single. Dialogue. Choice.  TL;DR The dialogue system is an utter failure. (and that's without mentioning my issues with the story or the problems with combat)",

It's turn-based and entirely minimalistic, but oh man, it's a very fun system. I've gone through two run-throughs of this game and I've realized that that was part of the reason that I loved this so much. It's amazingly done, especially considering the game was built in Ren'Py.  While I wouldn't recommend this game to everyone, pick it up if you want a solid game that has plenty of hidden content that will keep you coming back for more every time you find out something new.",

I liked it. Not every gamer is a twitch player, so this was a non-frustrating game to play.  I liked that the player had a ton of different romanceable companions, and endings, depending on the pc's gender and personality style. (Hence the many play throughs to see all the different endings.) Some of the relationships, however, felt creepy/abusive - the kind where you'd tell a girlfriend to WALK AWAY THIS GUY IS BAD NEWS sort of thing.  About a quarter of the writing fell into the 'purple prose' category. I could have done without all the internal musings by my character; it felt that the amazing dialogue between certain characters and reparte was written by one author and the internal musings was written by the author's angsty emo younger sibling.  That being said, I really enjoyed the game and the dlcs. Played 'Loren' for at least 39 hours, so I got my money's worth. Hoping the developer's next game - Season of the Wolf (?) when it comes out is equally good. And now that I've written a review of the game, I'll probably poke my nose into it some more.  ",

Instead, I was rewarded with perhaps the best western visual novel I've played. the writing is very strong and the characters are complex. There's no obviously right answer for most of the choices, which is fun because that means you can play your pc as a real personality, not a cardboard cutout of a 'good' or 'bad' avatar. You can play as a woman or man and there are romances of all styles. The combat doesn't feel that repetitive, which I was surprised by. Encounters feature variations of a handful of enemy types and spells, but they behave with just enough intelligence and variety to make even late game encounters challenging.   I highly recommend this game for fans of visual novels or anyone who loved spending time in camp in Dragon Age: Origins getting to know your companions.",

The characters are a mixed bag; some of them are actually pretty interesting, some of them are forgettable. The writing is also mixed. The dialogue tends to be snappy and organic, but the narration can get seriously cheesy.  The combat is . . . OK, I guess. Mixing characters and builds can be interesting, but things get a bit tedious after a while.  My biggest issue with this game is the price. It's not a bad game, but there just isn't enough content or variety to justify a $20+ price tag.  (Edit: I used my Steam version to unlock the demo version. Steam didn't log my playtime in that version, but I put plenty of hours into the game.)",

If you want to find all the endings, the Story Mode/Skip Seen Dialogue combo is amazing, and will keep your head from exploding from all the repetition.  Yes, exploding heads are bad... &lt;-- name that badly re-worded reference!  And while we're referencing it, yes - this can be compared to Dragon Age, although it's much smaller in scale.   There's a system where certain decisions you make will effect the ending. I think some of the added content from the Deluxe Version also has an effect?   And then there's the romance options. There are 6 in the regular version, 8 in the Deluxe Version, with different combinations of GxB, GxG, and BxB. 4 of the romance options prefer either Saren or Elenor, but the other 4 are open to either character you choose. And, if you romance someone, it's reflected in how the Epilogue changes.  The dailogue is really well-done too. Dependinging on whether you choose Friendly, Joking, or Forceful, you get different reactions from people, and most of it is pretty entertaining. :)  The biggest difference between the two games is the battle system. In Loren it's turn based, like what you would see in an older Final Fantasy set-up.   I definitely suggest getting the Deluxe Version of this game. Without it, there are 4 characters you won't get (2 of which are romance options). Check this one out if you like RPGs, games similar to Dragon Age, and/or games that have romance options. :)  ",

One of the core complaints regarding this game surround the developer's decision to remove risque content filtering from the offical release. While I understand the decision I feel as though the developers creative license was squashed over something that is essentially nonsense. The 'Risque' content is manageable through a simple options selection and is turned off by default. There is nothing 'Pornographic' about any of the original content.   This is a game that is very much story based. The primary themes are focused on basic human interactions suck as Family, Loyalty, Companionship, and Intimacy. The combat portion of the game requires stratagey and can at times be difficult. Art also plays a key role in the presentation of the game. all graphical content is static. While this may cause some gamers to turn up their noses, the artistic quality of all of the images is supurb.   This game is different but in a really good way. 8/10",

To fix this, go to the developer's website, download the free demo, enable mature content, play it until the first battle, save and quit. When you open the Steam version, you'll find the save ready to load and everything will be uncensored! You can choose your main character between a male human and a female elf. You can build their skills and personalities by choosing different answers that yes, will change the story. The choice of the protagonist also affects the romance options, as some characters are straight and gay (although the majority is bi). It's a story-heavy game, which means you'll read a lot. A lot - and you'll love every word of it. I'm not going to spoil anything of the plot, which is actually decent. The writing is also nice (there are some naive falls, like the use of the adjective 'electrocuted'. I doubt that electrocution is a known process in that world, but whatever). I would have enjoyed some more politics in there, but the told parts were in the right spots. The characters are great, all have a backstory and motivations, and you can decide to explore them or just have a glimpse. Just so you know, Draco is AWESOME. Loren is so sexist it's borderline hilarious. I like how the trope of the 21st century gal in Medieval fantasy is subverted :P  You have waaaaaay more characters than the 6 needed for your party, but it makes it more fun, you can rotate them. Just remember to keep them with some equip and a weapon because of plot reasons, even those you don't use. Once you complete the game once, a special mode called 'cheat mode' is introduced to replay just the story. You'll win every battle in 1 blow. The combat reminded me of tabletop RPGs. It's pretty simple at the beginning, but the more you progress, the more you need to plan each action, especially at hard mode. Normal mode is still pretty easy. Also... achievements! Soooooo many! And cards, whoop whoop.  I can see my whole family enjoying it for different reasons (and at different difficulty levels... and with censor on ahaha). I got it in a sale and now I almost regret it, it's worth the full price. The dev is also really involved in the community and it's great to see such dedication and love.  The DLC introduces an optional place, the castle of N'Mar, with lots of bosses (who introduce some interesting moral questions), achievements, a slightly different ending and three optional characters (two of them romanceable!). I did expect a bit more considering the price, but it's a nice addition and definitely great to play.  If you're still unsure, grab the free demo and try it out!",

Using the demo workaround you can also get the suggestive content back in the game, which is nice.   The combat is a bit ho-hum. Unless you seriously gimp yourself somehow it's pretty simple to just stack your part with a few 'good' characters and breeze through every battle, even bosses, who rarely felt like an actual boss as opposed to a mob with slightly more health. However, I played this game to have a story to engage in, so this didn't bother me.  Is Loren worth 20 bucks? Eh. I think WW deserves 20 for what is put into the game; it took me some 30 hours to beat my first playthrough so there's a significant amount of content which surprised me from the look of the game.

            "review_text": "REVIEW BASED ON WINDOWS TABLET PLAYTHROUGH  I purchased this game while looking for something to play on my Windows tablet. While I was able to play on my tablet, I would stop short of calling this game completely “touch-friendly.” It does use certain mechanics, such as “hover” to see info about items and spells, that are not native to a touch device. While the information is still accessible, without “hover” the process is cumbersome and often frustrating. Luckily, installing a virtual mouse/touchpad took care of this problem and I could access everything in the game with ease, as though I was using a real mouse.  Loren the Amazon Princess is, in large part, a virtual novel and the strongest selling point is easily the story. In fact, I feel it is on par with several AAA franchises, such as Dragon Age and the Elder Scrolls. The characters possess a lot of personality and I feel I really got to know them through the game's dialog and narrative. While the game takes place in a modest open world and there are a few side quests, it is never so overwhelming that you lose track of the main story and your ultimate goal. By the final chapter, I felt my decisions had weight and the lives of my party depended on me making the correct decisions.  This game isn't all story, however, and the combat is well done. It is turn based and conducted on a static grid, with opposing parties each having up to three characters in the front row and three in the back. While the setup is simple, there are enough skills, spells and items to keep the combat dynamic. I played on “Normal” difficulty and I found most battles challenging enough that I couldn't just tap-tap-tap through to be victorious. Strategic planning, resource management and a proper roster were key to coming out on top.  All in all, I was pleased to find the game had many pros and almost no cons. It is worth a play if this is a game type you either already enjoy or desire to try out.",

            "review_text": "In Short: if you enjoy fantasy RPGs, Dungeons and Dragons, party member interactions, and/or romance subplots then you will likely enjoy Loren the Amazon Princess.   The Pros There is a long list of party members to choose from to customize your combat style. There are a variety of locations and enemy types to keep the game from stagnating. You may choose between three conversation responses to give your character a bit of color. There are multiple romance options to choose from and each feel well fleshed out. There are points where your choices feel like they have weight on the plot and characters.  The Cons The game's art style leans a little too heavily on burly men and busty women, both in revealing, ineffectual armor. Not that I entirely disapprove, but it's a little too overt. Replaying immediately after beating the game is a bit tedious, at least at the beginning. I'm skipping a lot of dialogue so I can get back into the heart of the story. I would have liked to see more variety for the protagonist's class, and build options.  It has several cringe-worthy 'romance' moments - the kind where you hope no one is reading over your shoulder.

I really enjoyed this game. Part RPG, part visual novel and a whole lot of fun. Best to play with the DLC though.",

Though hard difficulty isn't really that challenging on anything that isn't a party member quest, it still shook things up a bit.  Would be 10/10 but the hot succubus wasn't bangable.",

            "review_text": "What a great game, 9/10! It is a nice mixture of VN and RPG tactical combat with a really great story which keeps you coming back for more. I needed 20h to finish the game without DLC, and I was positivly surprised that the combat mechanics is quite complex, the fight are just right (actually quite hard) on normal difficulty. However, the most important aspect is the beautiful characters and their romances. The music is another highlight for me... honestly, it is impossible to not fall in love with Myrth when the Elven music (I call it love theme) plays... and when she smiles at you you forget the world around you... :)  My only gripe with this game is that even romancing all with my chosen male character (there is a female to pick too for another playhtrough), and getting all the ending achievements, I only had 30% of achievements... too many come only from the DLC, which is much less discounted than if you would buy the whole game PLUS DLC, so no DLC for me, sorry. Nevertheless, I cried several times during the story, and fell in love with some of the drawn characters and the music!",
