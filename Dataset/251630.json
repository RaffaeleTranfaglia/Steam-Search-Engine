However, I've become super frustrated dozens of times due to the fact that the object I'm controlling just randomly bugs out, causing me to fail. When I go to jump, he jumps super high for no reason, and I crash into a block above me. Other times, he doesn't jump at all. The first few times it happened, I thought to myself, 'You know what, it was probably just me'. However, it continued to happen over and over again, and upon restarting, the block would be freaking out in mid-air as the level starts.  As said before, this game is still fun and enjoyable, but it has some issues. I'd definitely pick it up on sale, though.",

The game itself ist that hard as the name states, you have a set pattern of objects, since you cant stop, you are probably die the first couple of times you go trough them, but after you memorize them, its pretty straight forward.  It does have however, artificial difficulty, very noticeable when switching from auto jumps to manual jumps. The game adds some obstacles where you only have half of a square to land and some (a lot of) times it does a slide to your death instead of jumping. i can differenciate when i ♥♥♥♥ up and when the controls didnt responded.  It has some neat music that set you in the mood.  I guess its allright, i can recommend it since its fun and cheap but by no means its more fun or harder than super hexagon.",

The only downsides are that there seems to be a bit of a blurring issue and it can stutter a little sometimes, not quite sure why that happens. As for the price, $5 might honestly be a bit too much if you're not planning on using the Level Editor because you can pick it up the first 2 levels for $1 and the remaining 3 for another $1 on Android or iOS or for $3 on PSN. Right now the game is on sale for $4 and it's discounted even further down to $3 on the Humble Store, and it is certainly worth it at that price.",

            "review_text": "One of those fun, simple and challenging games of minimalistic controls and high speed. Here we have a constantly moving block, which can jump each time we press a button, or jump in chains if we hold it.   Most of the gameplay is about memorizing the layout of the stage, and associating it with clues in the background music and level's elements. After enough retries, we are rewarded with a complete stage, an achievement, and some challenge variant of it. It includes 4 levels and potentially- quite a few hours to sink into it. The easiest comparison for me would be the Super Hexagon (cause I don't have geometry dash), wchich also has minimalistic controls, low amount of levels, with spiking but fair difficulty.  And compared to that game, TIG has worse soundtrack (still ok though), worse visuals, and no endless mode. It features a level editor however, with BGM of your chocie (custom mp3).  For a low price it's a fun experience, buuuuuuuuut I happen to have a big issue when it comes to the visual feedback of the game, do not worry- it's very subjective. You see- I have very often played consecutive hours of Super Hexagon, whith my eyes simply growing a little bit tired; when playing TIG however- I suffer a major pain in the eyes, due to them constantly losing focus, and stinging despite regular blinking. This resulted in me not being able to complete anything beyond first level just because it hurt. I have no idea what causes it, but if something with visuals as flashy as SH managed to not give me any similar issues- I guess that there is a probability of the same happening to someone else.  I kinda feel bad for recommending it without being able to complete it, but I know what it offers, I just wasn't able to achieve it. So make sure to pick it at a low price, since it's not a huge effort game, but definitely entertaining.",

Also Ive noticed that the jumps are a bit higher which means two things: its now easier to jump over triple spikes and also like on level 4 it is VERY possible to jump too far which leads to death and restarting and more aggravation. This game is amazing on the IOS device but this steam version? Dont even bother. tl;dr: IOS version is better. Dont waste your money on this poorly ported game.",

For some unknown reason no music will play in the menu or in any level but the sound effects from menu selection or hitting triangles in levels do play like normal. I'll try to figure out why but so far I don't recommend getting this. If you want it for 99 cents buy it from the Humble Store. 5 dollars is ridiculous.",

I was so happy to finally jump over spikes and ontop of blocks with my orange cube, without having to play on a small screen. But what happend. This is a port, yes, but it's not as good as it could be. Some jumps are longer than on the mobile version even though it's the same level designs. for example some places you can hold jumps and it will jump down on the floor and up the next. On this port the next part is further away, making you land on the floor one more time than you should, right infront of a block, causing you to lose. I give this 6/10. I would have given it 9.5/10 if it would have been a better port. But if you want the real experience, don't buy the PC version, buy the Mobile version for iOS and Android.",

And sometimes the game just stops rendering anything at all and then crashes.  This was originally a positive review but I've had to change it to a negative one due to the extremely blatant and problematic jerkiness. For a game that's so about rhythm, it doesn't actually have one when it runs. It should be smooth but it's not.",
