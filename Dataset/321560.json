            "review_text": "Quick explanation about the game: The Sun and Moon is a platformer where momentum is conserved but gravity is reversed, letting you fling yourself high into the air or deep beneath the surface and in order to complete a level, you must collect 3 scattered beads around the stage before being able to enter at the exit point which is portal. Having the basic explained let me tell you something right now: This game is a newborn legend that rests atop with with the other beasts of platforming that are Super Meat Boy and Dustforce. I was amazed with how well polished is the level design, one of the bests I've seen in awhile, and it shows from the beginning to the end.  You start simple with the first world, some spikes a ground, platforms, you get feeling of diving into the ground and of momentum. But as levels come there is always something new and refreshing, you may face yourself with fireballs that race through the screen, appearing-disappearing platforms ruled by a set time, appearing-disappearing platforms ruled by if you are pressing the button that lets you through solid material, flying spikes that patrol a certain area, and even in every world there is a homing boss that will chase you until you collect all the beads, that in this case are 5 instead of the regular 3, and reach the portal but, the boss is different with every world. He may leave some spikes as he goes or instead of going at a regular peace, it will fling itself into your direction from time to time, so yeah lot of variety and of the good one.  Even though you may simply describe this game as a platformer, the best way to describe it would be a puzzle platformer, or that's at least how I perceived it, having in mind I was always aiming in obtaining a Sun Medal (The best grade out of the 3 that are included in the game). Why the puzzle part you ask? Because of multiple reasons actually but mostly because of the scattered 3 beads in the stage, it makes you really think and ponder: Which is really the optimal path? Which bead should be the first I collect? And after that? Not every time the beads are set in a simple path, maybe they are too far apart or maybe some momentum may be of help in shaving those milliseconds to achieve that so grossly incandescent Sun Medal. And things keep stacking up. Should I jump from platform to platform? Or dive into the ground continuously? When should I start moving before the clock sets on? I need that platform to be on, or that fireball at that distance at least, or that flying spike to be at least in the right instead of the left.  And that is why so brilliant the level design, it makes you stop and watch the stage and think, but I really mean it when I say think. I even at times just took a walk through the stage (If it was big enough) and watch carefully everything I should be aware of to just start planning, yeah you read correctly, planning. And after that, your regular Dustforce or Super Meat Boy: Try, try, try, try, try until you succeed.  Another huge plus is the music, it's so relaxing and soothing it will make it will hinder the possibility of becoming angry. It's somewhat similar to Dustforce´s music, ambient electronic. And it gets better, The Sun and the Moon´s OST is like an evolving album, as you progress through worlds you start unlocking new tracks and every track feels like an upgrade from the last one, like an evolving experience. Good stuff, I've never seen any game doing that with its own soundtrack.  I liked this one more than Super Meat Boy but less than Dustforce. What can I say, Dustforce has an astounding skill ceiling that probably no platformer ever will be able to beat. But, still it's tons of fun and with that price tag of $6.99 USD it's pretty damn hard to say no. I spent 30 hours, getting the most Sun Medals I could, on it with zero idle time so the price is extremely fair for the 150+levels the game has but if you play it just for completing stages I guess the game could be beaten in 16-ish hours. If you are a platform lover, please don´t lose the opportunity to play it.",

            "review_text": "A fun and simple skill based precision platformer. Art style and music are nothing to write home about but levels are interesting and challenging. Very much a game for completionist and speedrunners. Has a fun gimmick that has not become boring even after finishing 75 % levels. Rather short but cheap enough for me to justify the purchase. Platforming could be compared to Super Meat Boy.",

            "review_text": "This game was a pleasant surprise.   'The Sun and Moon' is an abstract platformer with some special aspects to it. The mechanics are creative and unique; you can turn the island/platforms into permeable objects through which you can move through (given enough momentum). Sort of reminiscent of Portal, but there aren't portals, just permeable membranes (?).   There's plenty of content. Runs fullscreen in 1080 at 60fps well. It gets addictively mesmerizing at times. It's dope.   I found it in a bundle, but at $6.99 its not bad.  ",

With a creative idea and retro design, this game really pleased me.  Although there aren't many extra actions (none that I have found anyway) you can do a lot with momentum conservation. There are so many levels to play, and they continually introduce different things you can do with your power.   Ok. I think that for the price, you get a lot of levels and entertainment. So go on, buy it!",

            "review_text": "  Amazing soundtrack that starts off repetitive but progresses and becomes an absolute dream as you progress through the levels. Tight and smooth (yet sometimes furiating) controls, but most-to-all failures are your fault. This game is brutal yet forgiving at the same time. New mechanics gradually get introduced, making you really start to think about the puzzles.   Music: 10/10 - Holy sh*t this soundtrack. I need to buy it. The progression is perfect.   Sound design: 8/10 - I love the sounds of even failure in this game, it's like gently smashing glass. Gently. Let that sink in.  Gameplay &amp; Controls: 9/10 - Strict, doesn't feel like there's any push from the game. Feels natural but tight.   Graphics: 7/10 - Simple graphics but with progression, the color pallet changes to two entirely different colors, contrasting the previous level from the current one. Very wise choice to keep the game varied through progression.  Puzzles: 4/10 to 10/10 - Varies on level/progression/skill.  Bugs: 0/0 - There are none. This game is polished head-to-toe. It's a flawless 0/0 bugs found from me.   If you've got a spare few bucks lying around, and you like a progressive challenge, buy this. It's even better getting it on sale, which it often is. Overall, I give this game a 'Charlie Sheen giving Trump a nut-crushing knee to the chin' out of ten.",
