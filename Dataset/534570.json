            "review_text": "Now I do enjoy hard games but this game is just down right torture.  You lose troops way faster than you can replace them, and in one game I got attacked 3 seasons in a row in the very start of the game. I lose before i could even hope to mount up a defense. However, I am sure others will love it. So I should perhaps try to be a bit objective.  You run a kingdom thats under attack by orcs, you need to produce soldiers and keep a good economy going so you can afford the troops and armor (which works as a chance to save a soldier that gets killed) to survive against the orc horde. Where you decide to fight has a huge impact on the troops, if you have a lot of archers choose a battle field they will be superior over the orcs cavalery. These battle choices can easily make your day. However the random spawning of attacks is really fierce, seeing as most of the time you permanently lose your soldiers if they are wounded unless you have enough armor, in that case you lose the armor not the soldier. The economy aspect of the game is really simple so it isnt really fun to manage it, it is pretty straight forward get the production of food up to maximize soldiers you can have, you need gold to train soldiers and armor so important to get goods you can sell for a nice amount but do not forget to upgrade the buildings so that you get more income ect. Simple management game with torturing combat.",
