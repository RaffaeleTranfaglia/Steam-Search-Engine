There's even a charging bullet time effect to help you out in a pinch.   As a bonus there's some extra game modes available, but the primary action is the best. There's a trippy electronica soundtrack and a lot of glitzy effects to go with the excellent color palette choices.  My only beef is that there's not an escalating sense of your own lethality which means the climb in intensity levels off and you just continue fending off the frenzy, which while fun can lead to weariness if you're able to pull off a long survival streak. Other than that it's a delight!",
