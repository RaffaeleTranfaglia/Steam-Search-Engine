            "review_text": "Short version: This game is great. Buy it, play it.  X-Com Apoc is a strange, but completely lovable creation. It's certainly an overly-ambitious game, and not all of its features were fully implemented. But it's not broken.  The cityscape is, like fans observe, a working ant-farm. Organizations raid each other, they raid you, you raid them. Aliens are a big part of the game by they are not your only enemy.  Political and military decisions directly impact on the game and on the environment. If you are at odds with certain groups, there will be consequences. Some are obvious, like not being able to buy equipments from them. Some are more subtle. If you make an enemy of the corporation that runs the public transport system, your new recruits won't be able to reach your base. How great is that?  Forget about the limitations of the (surely great) new X-Com: you can have multiple bases, and stack them with troops and vehicles. You'll need them. Each real estate to build a base have a different price tag and different spacing accommodations. As always, you'll have to choose wisely.  This games feature a very advanced version of the turn-based game mode of the classic X-Com. If you want a good turn-based experience, this game does that.  But the real gem, in my opinion, is the real time combat engine. It's simply fantastic. It's every bit as tactical as the classic turn based, but with refinements and even limited responses from the units. They will not dumbly stick around under fire, but will, while respecting their orders, move in and out of cover to fire. They will behave like actual soldiers would, panic including. You can pause at any time to issue commands, and you can also create groups.  It's a sophisticated tactical real time engine that - make no mistake - have little to do with traditional RTS games. It's a real joy to blast aliens and enemies like that. The missions are more fluid, as well. This game feature some huge maps that are a core to go through on TB but are almost a breeze on RT.  The cityscape interception combat is fully realized on this game, and you can have huge air battles between your craft and the aliens. Sometimes the local police may even help you.  Difficulty is Adjustable. It can be set to easy, and on the hardest difficulty it can give any game a run for its money.  This game is a lot of fun, and I really recommend it. ",

            "review_text": "  'If it bleeds, we can kill it.'    XCOM: Apocalypse represents a classic turn-based strategy experience, that provides the renowned XCOM style and related gameplay features. In comparison with the predecessors the management level moved from a geoscape to a cityscape, using factions of people and corporations instead of countries.   While it has an interesting story (though it requires reading between the lines), the squad-based combat system and tactical possibilities are definitely the strongest points of this game. In addition it is offering the chance for the traditional X-COM turn-based strategy, or the option for a real-time combat system.   Both options provide a different gameplay experience with its own strengths and weaknesses.    Achievements:    The game has no Steam achievements.

            "review_text": "If you're looking for a somewhat intense old school strategy game then you might like X-COM Apocalypse. In this game you control units and craft to destroy impending aliens, and as you go along you will get, better weapons/more ammo, access to disruptor and toxin technology, more agents and more money. However, the aliens get more advanced week after week, and you will commonly find disruptor guns at week 2, harder and harsher UFO's almost every week, new units and will sometimes attack buildings. In the 'Overworld' you fight alien craft and have access to the different menus (Other than the main in-game menu). In the Tactical (ground combat) world you first have a debriefing (Tends to be the same) and the choice between Real-Time and Turn-Based combat. You control X-Com Agents in the field and go hunting for the aliens, but be careful! If you put too many in one place to hunt you might find yourself in a LOT of trouble. Hence were waiting come in handy. You want to pick off as many aliens as possible (UFO Crash landings bring out the most of this) before sending your units into the darkness to find the aliens There are different ranks for each agent, from rookie to commander and to get said ranks you must fight in Tactical. The game has its fair share of bugs. Summary: a very strategic and fun game. 9.6/10",

It had average graphics at the time, but the level of customasation and features is amazing, I had no idea games could be this good back in the 1990's.  There are multiple maps and levels (go up to level 9) for every map, this game should not be underestimated, it has good voice acting and realistic damage system, exept for fire explosions.  There are quite a few bugs that they simply coulden't have fixed due to finances, such as many graphic bugs (nothing to major), enemies and soldiers glitching on the battlefield which isn't too major depending on the severity of the bug. There are also a few bugs that are commonly known, but I don't think its nessesary to list 'em.  I give the game a 8.5/10 for being a amazing game and having quite an early development time.  I can't wait for the new X-com. X-com: Enemy Unkown :D",

            "review_text": "Where do I even start? X-Com! this one was probably the very best!  The amount of detail they put into making the world, all the items, weapons, equipment, vehicles, aliens, enemies, entities, factions, right down to level design and overworld design - this game will have you totally immersed, whether or not you care for the graphics.  You can carry out raids on enemy factions/gangs for some vigilante justice, you could even choose when you want to go on a mission, either by pre-empting an alien alert in a building, or letting the alert call you in, and even then, you could totally ignore it and let the aliens infest the building and ultimately, let the aliens take over that faction!  There's a working economy, you'll start off as a buyer in the market, in order to equip your troops, but the gains you make from raiding enemy factions, and collecting alien technology means that you can eventually turn a profit on top of your organisation's (X-Com!) income from the Senate. Prices do change depending on supply (albeit only a little, but it was great they put it in); and of course, the world reacts to what you do on the market too, if you sell dangerous alien weaponry en-masse, don't be surprised to see it being used against you on the streets!.  Combat; you will want it to be slow-paced and turn-based, even if there is an active real-time mode, because you want to think every action through, and make sure your squads are prepared to react to whatever contingencies arise, and proceed effectively and efficiently to gain the best mission outcomes.   Do too much damage to the building, or injure or kill civillians, and expect it to show up on your bill, as well as a reflection in your relationship with that faction (a totally hostile faction can mean that they may outwardly attack your bases or personnel on the overworld, or if the faction is an infrastructure provider or an arms dealer; you'll find that their services will be denied to you - i.e. taxis will not deliver your new recruits, ship manufacturers will stop selling you ships, Android alliances will stop allowing you to recruit androids, hospitals can stop providing you medkits); of course, if you blast enough craters into the building, it could simply crumble down around your squad, wiping them all out. This of course, also means that there are destructible environments, every block on the map can be flattened to dust and ashes.  The research tree is another magnificent mechanic in the game, from quantum physics, to xenobiology, every bit of research leads to meaningful discoveries of powerful technology and understanding of your enemies, where you can harness the power of their weapons against them, to discovering weakesses they have, or possibly even develop bio-weapons that will be lethal to them only! D: Research enough tech, and you'll find yourself being able to manufacture enough weapons to outfit a small army, with your very own engineering division.  All the flavour text about any research you do, to the lore of the world, as well as any factions and entities have intriguing information about themselves that will keep your interest endlessly.  If you like turn-based, squad based strategy, mixed in with a management sim, look no further :D",
