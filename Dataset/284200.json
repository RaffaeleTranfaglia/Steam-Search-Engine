I was sitting there waiting for it to tell me what to do and how to move the robots, nothing. I experimentally used cursor keys and figured out what to do. Next level it said it gives me 45 seconds. No thanks.  I like reviews that say what the game's about, but I can't add anything to what the store page says, the game didn't tell me (see above).",
