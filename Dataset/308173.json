            "review_text": "This game could be described as Slitherine's Legion on steroids.  Having said that, the game system is much better by far than Legion ever was.  Not surprisingly, it uses essentially the same mechanics as Hegemony I and II.  Hegemony III is a semi-historical sandbox of Italy before the Roman conquest. It has a lot of historical flavor elements that come into play, but you can pick your favorite obscure Italic tribe and try to see if you can do better than the Romans.   The game is semi-historical because it telescopes several hundred years of development into a few game years. This is a good thing: if you've read Livy, you wouldn't want to fight the same war for one village year after year over and over again until you finally win. And if you've read Livy you also know that armies weren't mobilized and kept in the field according to Hegemony mechanics. You raised everything at the start of the year after you had finished planting your troops, and you didn't raise anything else unless there was a real emergency. Emergency troops would usually stand down after the crisis was over, and in any case everybody would go home before the fall harvest season. Nothing ever happened in late fall, winter, or before late spring.  Just to be clear, Hegemony III takes place long before the First Punic War, so you won't be invading Sicily or encountering Carthaginians. But if you've read Livy, the game is the perfect vehicle for refighting your own version of the Samnite Wars.   The only other game out there that makes a serious attempt (a very serious attempt) at presenting the Samnite Wars is Ageod's Birth of Rome expansion for Alea Jacta Est.   I like the ceramic art-inspired graphics, but people who aren't familiar with the conventions of ancient vase painting may find it takes a little getting used to at first.   I've been playing the game during the first week of release, so entirely without benefit of post-launch patches. While I'm sure that there's a thing or two that will get tinkered with down the road, I haven't encountered any game-stopping major bugs. I say that in the context of playing a couple of games (which will remain nameless) a year or two after release that are still riddled with bugs. The core system was hammered out in the first two games, so all that is probably going to be needed here is some fine tuning.",

            "review_text": "This is my first Hegemony experience, and I have to say this game is a pleasent surprize. To be fair there are still a few things that need to be worked out, but the developers take everything into account, from supply lines, and logistics, to upkeep and maintenance of buildings, and of course feeding your growing army.  + A well thought out economic structure forces you to pay attention to the details of maintaing your army and the supply lines that feed your empire. + Raiders and pirates frequently attack making it challenging to protect your resources, and the civilian population. - The Diplomacy is a bit enemic, but sufficient. + The AI is smart enough to flank you, and the raiders have powerful units, forcing you to use tactics to defeat them. + The 6 factions, Latin, Sebilic, Greek, Gaul, Etruscan and Illiryan have some similar units, and some unique units, offering diverse game play.   ( I have seen complaints about the units, but it's Italy, not Greece. Just about everyone had some kind of spear units, and Hopplites were used by everyone, until Rome changed the way wars were fought. There is a diversity of unit types and play styles. Gaul has more calvary options, and archers. Illiryans have srtong Infantry and Mounted Javelins, Greeks start being able to train Hopplites, while other factions need to have a Baracks upgrade first, Etruscan has axe men and so forth. So enough about there not being a good mix of units) - The city building of the AI needs work, and the AI in general could use a bit of a tweek. But lets be honest, it's AI....if you want a real Challenge play another Person...which reminds me - No multiplayer...yet - Just out of Beta, but there are still numerous minor bugs and crashes. I am sure there are patches to follow. Over all this is definitly worth the experience. It still has some teathing problems, but it doesn't take away from the fine work and thought that went into this game. Hegemony has to be one of the most under rated games I have ever seen. If they could do this on a scale that covers the entire European theater in the time of Rome, that would be epic! Great Game, passs it on!! ",

            "review_text": "Hegemony III, what a fun filled romp through Italian history, and by fun filled romp I mean civilization smashing and blood letting extravaganza that is unendingly cool. That aside, the game has its fair score of bugs and doesn't always explain mechanics. I have never been a fan of the Total War series; however, this was different enough for me to enjoy thoroughly as I learn the intimacies of the game. All in all I feel this game is exactly what I want it to be, giant pretty chess pieces rolling across a board that has no checkers and burning down towns with little men wearing purple pants. 10/10",

            "review_text": "8/10 at least. More when they patch it up.  Game isn't crashing for me, but I bought the game after the first patch and am running Windows 7 64bit.  A few smallish bugs do exist however, just nothing game breaking that I've run into so far 5 hours in. Devs are working on a patch at the time of this review.  Some Pros:  - Same Pros as all previous Hegemony games, just better and refined - Control Rome before they Conquered Italy - Different Factions add different flavours to playthroughs  Some Cons:  - Only 2 stock campaigns as of this review, one smallish and one large one. A medium one (or more smallish ones) and an Epic one covering a very large map would have been nice. - Supply line management can get a little tedious when your Empire gets larger - Since the game isn't turn based and is entirely real time fighting in more than 1 place at once is tedious, even with the pause functionality (can be argued as a good thing as well)  Overall I'm having fun with the game and have enjoyed other games by the same developer. Worth the buy in my opinion, even at full price. :)",

            "review_text": "So if you are a big history buff, some little things might irritate you, like how Piceno is used as the capital of the Piceni, when in fact the capital was Asculum and there was never a place called Piceno (its Pisaurum).   But lets face it most of you care about gameplay. To put it simple, its fun.   The downs: On anything higher than casual, the raiders are a little unbalanced - way stronger than the player and the AI nations. Its very easy to farm enemies for slaves instead of having to pay your own workers, its almost unfair. Almost.  The battle animations aren't total war good, and the size of the field of battle is way too small to do any serious strategic moves.  The ups: Everything else. This game is the first strategy game to tackle ancient Italian tribes in a pre-Roman/early-Roman era, and it is everything it should be. You get to upgrade your cities, much like Civ 5, manager resources much like Total War, take regions and worry about manpower and attrition much like Europa Universalis, and you get the close in battles also like Total War.  Incorporates all the elements of games I love and turns it into something new in a time period I love.   Get this game if you like strateg games.",

            "review_text": "I found it very hard to decide how I felt about this game but ultimately I have decided to recommend it. The game is challenging and very unique, I find, in its style as well as infinetely more open and intuitive compared to its predecessor Hegemony Rome: Rise of Caesar, which for me was nearly unplayable. It also brings logistics into the picture, forcing you to pay attention to your food and resource supplies in a way I have never encountered in anyother game and which I found very enjoyable. I also really liked the large map with the small scale focus on individual towns and cities as well as the unrestricted map movement compared with the previous Rise of Caesar game.   That being said there were many things I also didnt like about the game, chiefly the At-War-Unless-At-Peace mechanic of the game. Basically any factions you encounter you are automatically considered to be at war with you which means that right from the get go you are surrounded by hostile neighbors who will never cease to try and raid your territory. There are a few in game events that allow you to achieve a truce with one of your neighbors by completing a mission for them but this is ultimately left wanting since they can then break that truce with fairly little warning and with no real way to prevent it. The only other way to get a truce is to pay your neighbors hefty tributes which given the costly needs of your own defence and maintenance to face the rest of your neighbors are extorionately high but is never-the-less favorable to having to worry about them raiding one of your ill defended provinces, so long as you have the money to pay them of course. Additionally that is about the extent of the diplomacy aspect of the game and, at least for the duration of the game I have played so far, there is no option to form alliances, make trade agreements or perform any other acts of diplomacy to try and give yourself an edge. This constant state of war and very limited peace makes focusing on your own moves and plans exceedingly difficult because even if you are not fighting your neighbors you are likely fighting a rebel faction that cannot be negotiated with and which will make a beeline for you even when they are much closer to another faction's territory. Many of the in game screen shots posted on the store page show units of troops arrayed in military formation and gearing up for battle but. In my experience at least, this is virtually impossible because of the constant threat to your borders which necessitates having strong garrisons that are essentially able to fend off any enemy attack that comes their way becuase any reinforcements would likely be too late in arriving even if their redeployment did not interfere with your own attack plans. This dispersal of forces has made it virtually impossible to gather my forces in anything like expeditionary strength meaning that everywhere I am constantly fighting battles either on equal or disadvantageous terms. While good tactical maneuvering on my part helped to make up for this, it never-the-less gets frustrating, particularly when you are getting attacked in 2 or 3 places at the same time and in each of them you are at a disadvantage so that you are bound to lose eventually for lack of proper attention being paid one or the other of your critical battles. This is made all the worse by the limited manpower available which is used up quickly replacing your units and can make defeats very painful. Moreover, manpower is not pooled but instead is distributed based on the city a given unit was produced in which means that if I wanted to specialize one city to produce all of my best military units and focus my other cities on other areas I will find myself in a jam since if that city runs out of manpower then it doesnt matter how much manpower I have in other cities, I can't replace the losses to those units. This is made all the more complicated by the fact that manpower in captured cities formerly belonging to other factions is not compatible with your own faction's manpower so that if you ever want to disband a unit and regain its stored manpower, it can only be disbanded in a city of its faction of origin. This is where I feel that the game falls short compared to games like the total war series. Total war makes this aspect of the game very simple and logical using the standard At-Peace-Unless-At-War model for diplomacy which makes the diplomatic aspect of the game much more interesting as you forge alliances or try to negotiate peace with one of your enemies. It also makes it easier to engage in large set piece battles which you can then enjoy properly one at a time so that even if you are disadvantaged you at least have the ability to give it your full focus. As it is with this game it isnt really possible to have large set piece battles and the nature of the constant warfare of the game makes it difficult to enjoy the combat of the game which in any case is limitied by the necessarily small scale of the engagements that are likely to be encountered. If there were a way to have certain units auto-managed by a competent AI to defend parts of your borders so that you can put your focus where it's needed or, the easier way, if there just a broader and more rationalized system for diplomacy that would make the game infinetely better but unfortunately that is not a feature.   I realize that I have spent a great deal on the negatives but thats because I find the negatives more important than the positives in the ultimate decision of whether to buy a game. Although I found the balance of positive and negative to be in the positive side's favor that does not mean that there wasn't a great deal that has detracted from my experience of playing the game. If these detractions sound like deal breakers for you then so be it and steer clear of this game but If you are swayed by the positives then that is also your decision. In anycase, I'm sure other reviews can provide a more extensive list of the positives for this game.",

Not the typical style of RTS and makes it more feel like you're in ancient days. It also makes you think about food and moral of cities AND your units.  Con:  It's pretty repetitive after a short time and after you get the hang of things. On normal dificulty anyway if you pick one of the southern 'tribes' the correct path is 'Make Hoplites'. The AI won't make them and only make more of the cheaper less tough units. Hoplites will just crush them w/o taking many losses so you won't need to go re recruit.  Random AI aggression: Seems like the game will randomly decide a nation who's been quiet with you for a while will 'get a new and hostile leader. WAR!' which is kinda lazy honestly. It kinda feels the way the game is set up that there should be political mechanics as well. Maybe that just flows from the repitition thing though.   UI: Shocking. I had to restart at least a dozen games before I didn't accidentally cripple myself messing up the basics.   Graphics aren't great. Not an issue for me for this type of game but might be for you?  Maybe get it when it's on 75% off?  ",
