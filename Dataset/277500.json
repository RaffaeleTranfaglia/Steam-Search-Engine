The Tutorial is really slow, and is a bit irritating.  i have played about an hour of freeplay, and either i have not found it or it has no automation at all! wich is infuriating if you have 15 cow stables and everyone needs to be klicked twice every minute.  also the UI is suboptimal, it is too complicatet too sell stuff (again no auto), and every window needs too be closed by clicking a 3 pixel X, before its possible to do other things, like open the window you wanted to open in the first place, but you misclicked because the mouseovers are too slow, and the buttons for the menu are not intiutive.  One might say i have not played enough to Judge, but i say this game punishes you for playing, so i´m not trying again!  Sincerly Nordfalke   P.S. English not Native Laguage",

Sound is repetatble same sound every 3 secs, it gets really annoying after 10 mins. Music is horrified, repeats every 5 secs... simple tone like old home phone ring.  The gameplay is okay, but it's quite buggy and laggy, personally I am a big fan of sim/farming games, but this one is totally overpriced and at the look of it it's like those facebook games convert into pc games. Time consume is like very long waits in the game. This looks like farm frenzy #1 in the old days. many ideas are alike.  after 10 mins of gameplay I shutdowned all the tut. music/sound etc, I am very disappointed at dev. everything takes forever to build. Day/night cycle is useless. (brighter screen vs Darker screen.)  The idea of sim/farm game is really good, but it needs a little more work than this to do the job.",

On the other hand, cool season plants that appreciate being sown in the fall and going through winter, generally will wait for local weather to agree with them before sprouting - provided winter didn't get too cold for them. Also for some reason animals are much easier to raise and profit from than plants.",

            "review_text": "Mass production of alot of farms becomes insanly tedious, for example Animals break fences alot....maybee 10 times in their life cycle before payout. This would be fine if you have 1 set of animals...but if you want lots...you will find your self a full time fence repairing game.....just crap. The concept is great, and could be a sweet little game....but the forced micro management on little items like the fence, spraying, watering etc is just horrible.",

            "review_text": "One of the worst simulation games EVER! Best part of the game was uninstalling it...  There is (almost) no way of automation, just clicking the same buttons again and again and getting filthy rich. Some of the prices are so unrealistically high that you will become rich after selling your first loaf of bread and never feeld the need of feeding your animals again or just do anything... The AI doesn't do anything even on the highest difficult level. I think the developers just didn't program an AI at all.  The only good thing I can see is that they put a big effort in creating lots of production chains. There are plenty different products to be created and sold, but nevertheless it is not a really rewarding experience.  Oh, and I almost forgot: Within one hour of gameplay the game crashed three times..",
