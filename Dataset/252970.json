            "review_text": "So, speaking of outlandish premises, here's another that has that in spades. Is it a better game than Last Hope? I'd say so, and I would recommend it, but with some caveats.  The game stars the titular McDroid, who the game refers to as a dog-bot, and his friend a talking shuttle named...Shuttle. They return back to their friend Planet (who is a sentient) after a trip to find thing are a bit different. She's completely silent, mutated creatures are roaming about, and mysterious messages are around from an entity called the Somanto Corporation. You can probably see where this is going, and while I didn't find it too insufferable since you play as machines, the game does have an environmental message.  To heal Planet you'll need to heal special flowers to bring her back to the way she was, and to do that you'll need to protect Shuttle from the mutants Somanto's action have let loose. Like Orcs Must Die or Spacejacked you control McDroid and have an avatar in the fights. Unlike other games though, you don't just get money from killing enemies: instead you have to collect seeds strewn across the level or dropped at scripted moments and plant them. They'll sprout strawberries every so often, which you need to grab and bring back to Shuttle. Then you can spend them. Certainly a unique change but not entirely a welcome one, although you do unlock a unit that will do that for you later on in the game.  You can spend the berries on turrets, extra health or equipment for McDroid and Shuttle, and...Bonsai trees? The game has a terrain mechanic to it, where you can put trees in the same spots as your towers; they don't do any damage on their own, but spawn greenery in a certain radius. If a turret is in that distance, it deals much more damage. You can only put things in certain spaces, but McDroid has room for at least one turret or plant to carry around with him, so there's a lot of room to experiment.  Where it gets tricky is that the enemy has their own terrain, a lavaish field that deals constant damage to anything inside it - this is another game where your towers can get attacked, although thankfully McDroid can repair them by default, and quickly too. Plants can counteract the field, but they sort of cancel each-other out, so it's a good idea to have your turrets get rid of whatever is causing it, usually the corpse of some bigger monster. To do that though you click on it, which distracts them away from anything else, so you need to pick the right time.  It might sound like the levels have a lot to keep track of, and you're right. You're almost always on the move in McDroid, whether it's to collect some berries, shoot some debris, or boost your towers. That becomes a pain in certain things, like if you want to upgrade a tower; you need to have him holding the one in question before you can, which is cumbersome at times. To upgrade your kit you also need to personally collect gems that drop from destroying certain things or opening chests. You do get a grace period when the level's over to collect things you missed, and there are a few levels where you need to do other things in addition to surviving all the waves, which ensures you won't get booted out before you can get them all. You can use gems in levels to buy specialty things, such as some helper units that attack enemies for you or extra spaces for turrets and plants.  I finished all the main levels in McDroid except for the last one, which almost seems designed for co-op (which the game has), since you have to keep track of things in all four directions. That took me five hours. That's probably the biggest caveat: besides the story levels, there just seems to be more challenging versions of those levels and some endless arena levels. The game's twenty dollars full price, but even at five dollars, which I bought it at, you'd need to really like the game to get much out of it besides the bare minimum. I can't really say it's a bad game, since there does seem to be a lot of effort to put in, and it looks really nice. I might be less pleased with it if I have gotten it at full price, though. If you want a unique game that's a bit imperfect, McDroid could interest you.",

            "review_text": "Mcdroid is perhaps one of the most fun spin-off TD's i've played to date. Don't let the video or graphics fool you, this game can get really hard quite fast. The fact it also allows co-op on every level is another plus which makes the game that much more fun. I recommend this game to anyone that loves TD's and is looking for a challenge.",

            "review_text": "McDroid Is a very fun and addictive game that is in its own category. It is part Tower defense, part 3rd person shooter, part RTS. It has good graphics with good game mechanics as well. You can play for any period of time to either kill some time or just go BALLZ OUT and just destroy everything and everyone to see how far you can get within the levels. The best part of this game is that it is actually very challenging.   Each level has its own style and you have to find that sweet spot just to clear it. of course you will never be happy on how you did on the previous level, so you'll want to retry it yet again and do a different build. And the best part is, each level has a challenge level and a nightmare level where you get to play from where you left off at in your previous playthrough instead of starting from scratch. So if you end up getting your butt kicked (and you will) you can go back and redo the easier mode to set yourself up better in the harder difficulties.  And just when you thought you had a good strategy and build, you unlock and upgrade more and more towers and weapons, which is awesome, but is also like throwing a wrench in the gears, because you have to rethink everything you have just learned. But its all good, that is a great feeling and adds so much more to the game.   I would recommend this game to anyone who has just the slightest interest in Tower Defense, Challenging games, building games, cutesy games, ect. This game may not look like much, but it has more than you can imagine. Try it, buy it, get involved. Lets get this game on the map and hope for a sequel.",

            "review_text": "This game sucks in a way that it keeps away you from doing anything else ;-)   It is very lovely done, the graphics are really nice, kept in a comic-lice style.  The story is ... well ... odd. Long story short: You crash-land on a planet and need to refill your strawberry-juice-engine. While planting and harvesting strawberries, you have to keep the 'local population' away from them and prevent your own destruction, because they bite and shoot.  Handling is very easy,  Just run, collect and upgrade. Shooting at enemies is done automatically, but you can also choose a primary target by just clicking it. All weapons fire is then focused on that. There are many different weapons and items which will help you doing that.  You will find blueprints and diamonds throughout the game to research and upgrade these. Your McDROID has an arm with which it can repair damaged turrets and your shuttle.  After you finish a level, the challenge and nightmare mode for that level will become available for more fun. And if a level ist just too tough fou you alone, you can invite friend to help you out. Yes, this game is multi-player.  Is it worth the price? Yes. Definitely.",
