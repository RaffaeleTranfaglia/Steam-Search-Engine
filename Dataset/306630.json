            "review_text": "The bad reviews almost stopped me from getting this...This is why I am writting this review. I ended up getting the game and was very very happy with it. It has a tremendous amount of depth, features and choice options on how to manage your side of the conflict. I really enjoy the strategic and regional level choices, while coordinating supply and unit command formations.   I hate bugs and I hate crashes, when i read that in the reviews it was very dissapointing and I almost didn't purchase the game. If you are experience crashes, there are several suggestions in the forum as to fixes. For me personally I used the userpath.ini delete fix and thought that worked very well cutting down on crashes. Also something to note, you can get the game to auto save between 3-12 turns...so crashes or tech issues shouldn't stop anyone from playing as you can easily recover, and sometimes just reprocess the turn.  Immersion, This game via its strategic and regional level options combimed with supply, unit production and army configurations is defintely a deep, rich and immersive experience. The map is huge, has many fiters and the wego system is by far the best system to be used on this kind of game. I want to really reiterate that, some games I don't think its great for and this is the first game I've truly been able to say, is better off for having the wego system as it provides the best gaming experience for this war/era.   This is not for the light hearted gamer nor the total war style of gamer. This is actually more realistic because in a grand strategy sense you are not some godlike presence that can order every individual unit on the battlefield. You do choose who commands your bde, division, corps or armies, you do get to build up these types of units and combine them to make your composition of forces, and if you pay attention to the ground your fighting on, supply, unit cohesion and all the other factors the game takes into account, you will do well. However, if you take 20k men into a seige, tell them to assault the walls with no arty support, guess what, ur men are gonna get slaughtered.   I personally spend 1-2 hours per turn, the game does 2 week time frames, early in the month for the first two weeks and late in the month. This works great because the game using the wego system processes each turn into 15 days. So coordination of forces matter a lot and in reality u have every single day of the war being played.   I had never been a fan of the ageod battle system, I personally dont think its right for the american rev period, nor do i think its right the for world war one era, for the civil war and the napoleonic era though its really is the most realistic and superior system for those time periods. I encourage you if you are a grand strategy fan, to try it and give yourself a few days of playing to get used to it. I believe like myself you will see the benefit and the beauty of the system in this time period for this title.   You will absoutely get your monies worth if you put in the time to learn the features and options. The Grand strategy genre is my absolutely favorite and those are the games I really excell at because of all the different things you have to manage. I know this isn't billed as grand strategy because you can only play two sides, but the amount of choice, different options and features in the game make it a grand strategy title to me. Indeed, I wish they came out with a game like this that allowed u to be any country in the world like a lot of the paradox titles allow you to do.   All in all i highly recommend this game if you love history, the civil war, and grand strategy games.  ",

            "review_text": "I tried AGEOD's first Civil War title and did not like it. So it was with skepticism that I bought CW2. Im glad i did, CW2 hooked me and then some. If you are looking for a Total War type experience with tactical battles, then this game is not for you. If you like classic Grand Strategy wargames, then this should be right up your alley. To me, the test of a good strategy game is one that has you wanting to finish that one more turn before going to bed and one that keeps you thinking about the game after you left the computer. This game will do that.  Be forewarned...you must spend the time reading the manual, doing the tutorials and watching some 'lets play' vids on youtube to learn how to play this game...the interface is a bit clunky at first, but not bad once you get used to it. The game unit cards and map are well done. This game reeks of civil war flavor...  I have had only 2 CTD crashes in the many hours that I have played...both of these were at the start of new turn processing and were easily recoverable without any issues in proceeding with the next turn.  Lots of strategic choices that allow for special actions, unit building, etc..  CW2 rates a thumbs up in my book!",

            "review_text": "One of the most exciting and gratifying games I've ever played.   I kinda liked AGEOD's game before CW2, but never gave them the time to fully follow them through to mid game, but with CW2 it all changed. This game captured my attention right from the beginning, right from the main screen.   There was something about it, that made it look very 'authentic', so I gave it the oportunity, and went through all the tutorials. It probably takes you about 2 or 3 hours to go through all the tutorials when reading the whole thing, but it was worth it.  When I started my first solo campaign, I started experimenting, moving the pieces. I have to be honest, sometimes I felt lost. It takes some time to get used to the user interphase. When I started to get more familiar with the game, thats when the sense of achievement started invading me. Enacting the economic, military and diplomatic decisions, recruiting a great variety of units, choosing the right generals for the right army, corps or division... OMG, loved it!  Right now after 50 something hours in the game, I'm still enjoying playing the Union. I think I'm still going through the learning curve, since I believe there are still some tricks I'm missing in order to dare starting a full scenario siding with the CSA (that is a challenge).   Usually I don't like writing reviews, but this game is a true gem, and as such, I think it is my duty to spread out the good word.",

If you are impatient, have a low tension span, or like fast-paced games then this is not for you. The game takes a while to learn which I really like. It's fun in the learning stages but can get frustrating at some points.   There are two cons I have with this game- 1. The UI could use some tweaking. 2. The game has much needed work on the stability issues (It usually crashes between 7-11 turns).   Where this game really shines is how you can change history, but in a much detailed level. From industralizing the South to making decisions to convincing the border states to join the CSA, it has it all.   The games engine allows you to organize your army as you see fit. When you do, many minor or major factors apply which can be game changers for the next battle. So make sure you use the system of organization wisely (brigades, divisions, corps, and armies)",

You order almost every unit in the game one regiment at a time. The battles have limited input for you, just picking formation and then the result pops up.   While I love the gameplay, I have never finished a game, and this is why I can't recommend the game. I progress to a point in the game, usually early 1862, and the game has some type of graphics hiccup that causes it to crash to the desktop. Reload, crash. It might not be so bad if it save multiple versions of the game in different slots, but invariably I end up losing many months of gameplay and quit in disgust.  Great game and if it was stable, I'd recommend it for true grognards.",
