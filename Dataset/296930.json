            "review_text": "After about 12 hours in the game here are my thoughts.  Initially I really liked the game. However, as time past here are the things that have really bothered me and why I can't recommend it in its current state.  There are boss fights that are near impossible to beat unless you are set up just right to beat them. i.e. luck. e.g. Furthest I have gone after 12 hours of play time is late fall. On the last run I met the son of something and he had an invulnerability shield. That shield was up about 80% of the time. No way I could beat him with all the spam he puts out.  Very few people have beaten the game.  Simply put, if only 3% of players are beating your game on normal mode that is a design problem, NOT a player problem.  That 3% is probably attributed mostly to sheer luck, as I am sure it is well within the margin of error for luck in this game considering out random it is. There are some, what I call, cheap mechanics, in the game, such as that invulnerability shield, or bouncing fire/acid in very tight spaces that can't be destroyed. Things such as that, are why players die, and also why they give up on the game. They feel cheated. For the most part, I like how the levels themselves playout, but I find the boss fights tedious and quite boring, not to mention in some cases cheap.  I would have loved to just see the game as one big tower perhaps, continous in nature, with no boss fights, or perhaps more well thought out bosses. As it is now I am going to put this one down for a while, and put it under my in development category where it belongs. I just find the first two parts, Spring early and late, too boring to trudge through over and over again after I die. There are much better roguelikes out there, with much better balance (Binding of Isaac, Rogue Legacy, FTL, Risk of Rain, SotS The Pit, etc....).   I really hope there are future updates to the game that address the issues I mention. The game has great potential, but I just can't consider this game as finished as the balance is way off (reward/accomplishment system is also near nonexistant).  Additional Later Review (20141129)  Now 40 hours into this game, and I have beaten it on normal now with all but Midas and the last guy you unlock (forget his name). I still stand by much of this review.   While I actually like the game a bit more now, having gotten really good at parrying many attacks and learned all the boss patterns, and with the additional unlocks making the game difficulty more acceptable, I still have to say that the game difficulty could use some refinement.  I still find the invulnerability shields a horrible idea, and just a easy way to make boss fights harder instead of making the boss fights more interesting. The boss fights imo are the weakest point of this game. The last boss types (fighting another character, and that big guy after him), including the final boss are easier than some of the earlier bosses. They need MAJOR refinement. Open up the space, have a boss fight on a big area instead of an enclosed space, and use the environment more to make it interesting (spikes for example).  There is still not much of a risk/reward system in the game, and you are still forced to clear every room you enter (which is against the idea of the roguelike where you DON'T have to fight everything, and probably should not).  Some epic weapons are just too epic, like the twig. I mean, infinite mana, basically?! I could see half or a quarter, but zero mana use?! If you have any decent, not OP, but decent spell combo with twig it is basically game over, you win, unless you get really careless.  So yea, game still needs more refinement, and I do like the game, but I don't love it. Sad part is that I want to love this game, but as pointed out above, some things about it just irritate the crap out of me.  @Bluecard: Perhaps you could come up with something more constructive, or maybe you are just a troll.  @Karob: I appreciate the comment, but well designed roguelikes, the ones that are succesful and actually have people who continue to play them because they are fun, have some level of structure within the game that tempers the randomness such that the extremes don't occur or occur very rarely. I completely agree with the journey, not the destination statement. Problem is I enjoy the journey of this game with moments of severe annoyance, not frustration or displeasure due to losing, but just being annoyed, mostly with the boss fights. I win most all the boss fights, but I feel they take more away from the game then they give. They feel forced, and feel like a very different play style from the rest of the game, the part that I actually enjoy. I just want to enjoy the entire journey the game provides, not just some of it. I think that can definitely be achieved with some rewrites of the boss fights as mentioned above.",

What (or who) is the character?. The game feels hollow and empty, almost without a story. I found the graphics colorful, but dull. The scenarios are not attractive at all, a lot of colorful tree like structures with some lines, but they don't seem alive. Why in the world are you running in this forest killing grunts and those strange flying things?. The music kind of 'meh', but repetitive. As someone reviewed, it's forgettable.  After playing Guacamelee (in all this forms), I found this game be quite similar (beat em up, colorful, a lot of enemies), but lacks humour, variety and charm. Contrary to Guacamelee, the rooms are randomly generated, and harder, but it's not enough for wanting me to go back if there's no motivation behind.  Yeah, I know, I played for less than an hour (probably half an hour). With a enormous backlog, I couldn't find any reason to play more time to see if the game get better. It's strange when you see all the praise (126 positive reviews), but well, maybe makes sense playing more time.   TL; DR",

I very much liked the art style and general look of the charecters was appeling to me. there is a large veriety power ups and upgrades to find and unlock that alter your abilities and can finer tune your play style, though the random nature of what powers you get won`t always help asmuch as you may need, but thats just the chips fall. Any way I highly recomend Ascendant and don`t think it will disapoint.",

            "review_text": "This game is probably one of the harder games I own. The melee enemies aren't too tough because just using the light attack to weaken them then satisfyingly smashing them with the launch attack does the trick, but I find the projectile-launching enemies are all just stupidly unpredictable a-holes that make the game a frustrating mess of dodging and pinpoint counterattacking.   Let me get one thing straight: The counterattack works. It DOES work, and is very satisfying when pulled off, but doing so is, to quote JonTron, 'like trying to pull the addiction out of a heroin addict: HARD AND FRUSTRATING.' The window of time on this counter is TINY. Teeny-tiny. You ever play Smash Bros. and find that the counterattack windows are rather short? Well, this game takes the window of time that someone like Marth would have and crushes it with a STEAMroller (get it?). We're talking probably 4-5 frames of counterattack availability. It's annoying when you're playing a game like this that has a lot of unpredictability in the enemy attack patterns, but to throw in a 5-frame counter window is just unecessarily cruel. The counter window CAN be expanded if you happen to find a 4-leaf clover under a blue moon while a shooting star flies over your head and somehow manage to get the weapon enchantment that does so, but I only got that on one playthrough, and died because a projectile-using enemy knocked me into a pit of spikes and killed me, FANCY THAT.  Don't get me wrong: this game IS fun, it's just hard. We're talking giant T-rex turds hard. Adamantium hard. The kind of hard that even a Metapod couldn't achieve and...yeah this metaphor is over.  What I'm saying is, if you're the kind of person who's gotten good at avoiding things in Rogue Legacy, maintaining twitch reflexes in Hotline Miami, and love the roguelike item-collecting enhancement-gaining world of Binding of Isaac, this is your game. Oh yeah, and if you're one of those sadistic f***s that likes Dark Souls, get this game. You'll be (un)pleasantly surprised. Can I say, Prepare to Die? ;)  Thanks for reading!  TL:DR This game is hard, get it if you like roguelikes that are hard and have fast reflexes.  EDIT: I've been trying to beat this game for a total of 17 hours now and I still can't do it. That give you an idea of how high the difficulty bar is?",

Play through the four seasons, which a represented in eight worlds (early/late spring etc.) with a randomly selected boss at the end of each world. The combat itself is fun, you slice yourself in a responsive and fast way while launching enemies against walls, spikes or more enemies after doing enough damage to one, trying to get them into a staggering status. Dodge and reflecting projectiles are further elements that make the combat varied and challenging. With every run you will discover new items, spells and weapons that you can combine in hundreds of ways. If you are into brawlers that and rogue-light games this game is a must have.",
