This is one of those games where your progress depends on the item you get. Think Metroid with checkpoints and unlimited lives. Every time you get a new item, a new area becomes reachable, so you have to memorize all of the areas you can't reach to go back to them later. I also enjoyed all of the options to make the game window look even more like an old Commodore 64 computer. A true blast to the past.  Overall, a great free game and worth the disk space.

            "review_text": "Even with many indie releases made in the retro style, it's still quite interesting to me how far devs will go to mimic the exact style of retro games. For me, this is best shown in You Have to Win the Game.  Cons: -No music whatsoever. I understand that it's going for the style of a Commodore game, but many games for that computer had good music. This is my biggest problem with the game. -It seems to me as though the developer (who refers to himself as Kyle in the 'support the developer' section) tried too hard to exactly mimic the C64. I would love to see this game made more expansive. Pros -Metroid-style gameplay. Of course, there are fewer items, you're not a badass Power Suit-wearing bounty hunter like Samus (in fact, as far as I know, there is no weapon) but the combination of player-driven exploration and strong platforming bears a resemblance to Super Metroid or Metroid II. -Amazing conveyance. Here is how the developer designed the game: You start the game and immediately encounter branching paths. Since the player just started, they want to keep going. They choose a direction and go. As they go along, they find outlines of platforms. They realize that there must be something to create platforms. This gives them the patience to keep going. They eventually find a boss. Having no weapon, they instead figure out the most effective way to dodge the barrage of projectiles. They then will find either the Crimson or Cerulean Aura. Et cetera, et cetera. Short version: the game is good at keeping the player going and teaching them. -The player is always, always in control.",

            "review_text": "What really defines a 'retro game?'   Sure, there are quite a few two-dimensional one-afternoon's-scope games out there with chunky, obvious pixels and 'chiptune' soundtracks -- how I hate that appellation, much as I dig the genre itself -- and surely you've encountered buckets of 'em in your travels. They're clearly trying to appeal to a certain nostalgic market, but I find that many of these so-called 'retro' games don't really understand what it is to which they're alleging to pay homage.   You Have To Win The Game has no such difficulty. It understands its audience quite intimately.  If you've ever played an early home computer platformer, with brittle, stylized art tiles on a sea of black background, stages rather than a scrolling continuous playfield, and that curiously fast twitch-timing that makes 'simple' tricks hard to duplicate without a dead-steady hand, you'll recognize this one immediately. Fans of the Monty Mole games, Jet Set Willy, Montezuma's Revenge, Dark Castle, and other multiscreen platformers will be right at home. The CGA-style 'magenta and cyan' default graphics cement this port clearly as a PC game, though there's an option to step up to 16-color EGA graphics if you prefer. The PC speaker style sound effects, staggered hex-aligned pixels with faint scanlines, and bowing of the screen to a curved glass surface really drive home that this game is an artifact from a cultural time capsule, and the simulated monitor bezel around it completes the effect nicely.   Be sure to return the disk to its protective sleeve and file it away in its sunshielded flipcases when you're done with it.   The game itself is delightfully frustrating, prone to tease the player with glimpses of as-yet-inaccessible areas, to inspire mad curiosity about the only occasionally map-friendly physics. Many rooms map easily, yes, but some loop back on themselves, or take you to places from which you can't easily return by stepping back through the passage behind you. Some rooms are clearly designed to make you sweat and suffer, and suffer you shall if you want to earn that coveted 100% at the end. Be glad for the unlimited lives in the standard game mode -- you'll need 'em. (If you're truly crazy, try the Playable Cat mode for nine lives, or the YOLO mode for a single life.)  The game is an exploration platformer and a puzzle game. Without ruining its secrets, let it suffice to say that careful note-taking, mapping, and that sort of curious and self-reliant Eighties gamer mindset will serve you well. The sort of person who would prefer platformers to be purely feats of dexterity may be frustrated by this game's unavoidable puzzle elements, but I suspect anyone who remembers the games that inspired You Have To Win The Game will recognize that this was de riguer back then. There are certainly some moments of frustration to be had playing this game, some vexingly tricky rooms to navigate, but that's part of the fun of it, really. Anyone who's put together Monty Mole's Freedom Kit or played a Sierra game in which it was all too possible to end up in an unwinnable game for lack of an item acquired earlier is surely used to these frustrations, and the 'sunrise moment' of finally getting past a tough room to see what lies beyond it is ample reward.  Curious minds will be left with many questions about the game world visited. The minimal, simple graphics and room names offer clues, but few answers, as to who you are, where you are, how you ended up here, why you're here, and what you're after. This too was part of the charm of these games, but I find myself intrigued by the landscape the game so simply depicts, and given such a large blank space where narrative and purpose would sit in a story, I find myself trying to imagine how this unnamed protagonist got here, to this dangerous world with its varied alien and Gothic imagery, and who the few named figures in the game are, or were.   As a platformer, it's delightfully tricky but not impossible. This aging gamer managed to achieve 100% after six hours of play, and six hours of play is quite impressive for a game of the era to which this one's paying homage. The game is well-balanced, too -- there are many optional challenges for completion that aren't strictly necessary to win. (I've seen five-minute speedruns through it.) There are some lovely challenges awaiting completionists, though, and the game does indeed reward you for your additional effort. Like every great exploration game, there are places you'll miss if you don't explore thoroughly, and seeing them all will take some real effort.  This is not a retro platformer for folks who simply like the idea of 2D games with chunky pixels. This is a love letter to the mid-Eighties home computer platformer, from the eloquent and unmistakably informed pen of J. Kyle Pittman and Pirate Hearts. This is a return to a lost era, and it is meant to bring back not only the look, not only the feel, but the entire zeitgeist of a bygone age of computer games. Tread reverently. This is a relic from an alternate universe's past, a living fossil. You can't meaningfully compare it to the games of today, at least not in capacity to rate it. Compare it to games of the increasingly distant past, and if you haven't played those games, play this one. It's a stellar specimen of the early days of home computer platformers.  Auf wiedersehn? Willkommen zurück, Monty.",

            "review_text": "A very authentic throwback to the pre-NES PC days. As someone who actually knows what a 5.25' floppy drive is, I really appreciated this. The use of the 4-color CGA palette, sprite and tile design, physics, and PC speaker beeps, and especially the level design philosophy are all spot-on. The CRT screen emulation is also genius. (Can it be open-source so we can use it for emulators?)  Difficulty and play length is about the same as VVVVVV. If you found that game easy, you won't have a problem with this one either. But if you're not good at these exploration platformers, prepare to rage your way through a few rooms. But don't worry, the checkpoints are always about 2 rooms apart, so dying is no big deal.  Just be warned, you can 'lose' the game, too! And if you lose, you lose all your progress! There's only one way to lose, and it's clearly marked, so keep an eye out for it!  This is a very good opportunity to feel some nostalgia even older than most other throwback games offer, or if it was before your time, a chance to see how PC games looked and felt back in the 80s. It’s free, and you can beat it in less than two hours if you’re moderately good at platformers, so why not?",

It wasn't boring, far from it. it got you to think and remember where you was most of the time as this game isn't straight forward. It's not just jumping and running as well, You gain certain 'abilities' throguhout the game when you for instance, get past a boss, you get access to 'spider gloves' which allow you to jump from walls and slide from them and this opens more levels for you to access to, since you wouldn't be able to do so in some areas. More abilities will be obtained the further you go into the levels. You would also need to ace this game 100% if you want to properly 'win the game' but just finishing the game is good enough since you get a chance to go back and fine the money bags (It's what you collect throughout the game). If you found the game too easy, there is YOLO mode (It's self explanatory, one life and no checkpoints) and extra spicy mode (increased difficulty with an extra portion of rage). For me, this is great game to pass time. It has a nice retro feel and keeps you entertained, best of all: It's free.",

It's really hard, expect a thousand deaths on your path to the end of the game, where you invariably will lose the first time because you haven't figured the magic word out yet. So you're started from the same place again without your power pickups, where you get to play through the whole thing again in a try to figure the answer out. If that's not enough for you, you can run the game in a cat form, with only nine lives. Or in the YOLO mode. And after that there's a harder remix of the levels for you to try out, again with the earlier mentioned modifications if you find that too easy...  Aesthetically, the game hits it's spot. It's got that CGA monitor, scanlines, big pixel, CRT bending, effect to it that looks really authentic. Or if you want to upgrade to an EGA monitor, you can do that, too. If you want to turn off the CRT screen effects, you can do that. The controls are really responsive and smooth, with one little nitpick from me - if you're using a controller, for this kind of platformer I really would like to be able to use the D-pad for movement instead of just the left stick. The D-pad might have it's limitations in directionality, but it's better for twitch changes in directionality.  The game uses a metroidvanian backtracking reliant room and map design, except of course for being a jumping puzzle platformer and not shooting action platformer. It doesn't have much story, but that is on the other hand very much a symptom of it's time when it comes to the vibe it tried to hit.  Do I recommend it? Yes I do. If Nintendo hard gaming, CGA/EGA era DOS or NES platformer nostalgia is your thing, this is probably a game for you. And of course, you can't beat that price!",

It really captured the feeling of 'oh cool, that's how I get over there.'  There are some annoyingly hard rooms, but checkpoints are frequent and you respawn immediately. If the CRT and visuals aren't to your liking, you can modify them in the options to be more colorful and drop the monitor within a monitor effect.  There's also very little hand-holding involved. You basically start up the game and explore with no intrusion. A fun little game which has more depth than you'd expect for a free, retro-themed platformer.",

Playing this game has sky-rocketed its sequel,  'Super Win the Game'  to the  TOP  of my Wishlist. It is just that damn fun.

The game is not going too hard for that aspect though, it's not as hard as you'd expect but hey, there's a cat DLC! and it's also free!  The level progressing system will go like something from an atari or something you'd see on VVVVV, with every level having it's own different name and there's always something different. There are cash bags you can collect and i'm not really sure what you can do with them, but they are something you can go all like 'hey i want that!'  Since the game doesn't offer as much as an AAA game do, but it offers as much as a retro-atari game do, so in the old times this would be considered a full game, and i think that's great.

OK, I get it, this sentence has some negative aspects these days, but I can assure you that this is really a complete free-to-play single player game. Not surprisingly though, since it's quite short.  Story  Well, there is actually no story to tell here and it doesn't really matter. Just jump through the game and imagine your own story.  Gameplay  This game is really your most basic Platformer Game. You can jump and walk and if you touch an enemy you'll die. The world is divivded in seperate screens, which even have their own unique names. Something that helps if you talk to someone about the fastest possible route. YhtwtG has a Metroidvania styled gameplay, so you need to collect different upgrades and go back to previous regions to use your new upgrades. There are four upgrades you can find. a red and a blue power up to activate colored blocks (it's up to you which one you want to find first), the classic double jump and at last a pair of Spider gloves (used for Wall Jumps). It's not too difficult to learn how the game works and if you're good you can finish it in even under 10 minutes.  Graphics  Fitting for a 80s retro game YhtwtG uses an EGA graphics mode. The entirety of four colors at your personal disposal. Believe it or not, there are actually games out there which only have four colors. But don't worry, there is an option to change it to an eight color mode if you want. There is even a nice little option to set up a VGA monitor bondary with a twisted screen on the edges. The only way to reach more nostalgy in this game is to deliver it on a floppy disk.  Conclusion  If you have a sudden wish for nostalgy or if you just want to see how games looked in the stone age of the computer technology, You have to win the Game is cleary something you need to try out. And that all just for the price of a little space on your hard drive.

I also love platformer games and the controller for the 360. I HIGHLY recomend it. I have been into pixel games eversince Undertale and You Must WIn The Game. I think the title need more and could be better, but that doesnt matter. GET THIS GAME! Its amazing, and its FREE! DUDE! This game should be like at least 5$ It would be worth it. I would buy it. I am manly talking to the creator or creators but I think its also only one! So that is amazing. If any does a thumbs down (not recomended) the obviously didn't play the game lol because they are just haters lol. Anyways, this game inspires me to make a platformer and get more technical then just a RPG. I will start making platformers and 3D games on unity and gamemaker studios which I use. I use gamemaker for RPG and only one time unity 3D. I will hope one day I will end up like this guy, or guys and girls... Anyways, this is getting pretty long, I hope when I finish it there will be a sequal! PLEASE! That would be awesome, maybe you can make it free, but I will get it either way. But if you make this or make a sequal and make it cost money, please don't make it cost alot. Like, I don't have much money because I buy other games and softwares for my videos on limited gnu3 on youtube. So I am going to do a video on this game and I will hope it'll get popular and promote this game because it's epic. This is long so I will end it here, so to wrap it all up and give it to krampus, this is the best platformer I have played in 2014, 2015, and now, 2016! its awesome.

I could go on about how this game doesn't have any original gameplay elements, how you can find many games like it, etc... But that doesn't matter for a recomenndation based review.  Gameplay is satisfying and based on timed jumps with an emphasis on flow once you figured a pattern out. Lots of secret little mathingies to find. The classic element of 'find power up to progress' is ever so present. There is also a puzzle that I solved by alt-tabbing and googling the answer. It's polished, I couldn't find any bugs, it runs well, sounds are very nice, graphics work for the style of game it is with the good old twist of having a fake monitor in your monitor. Most importantly, you get all this good to great gameplay for free. If this was a 10 euro game I wouldn't recommend it because of lack of content. 5 Euros? Still dangerous. 2 Euros? Well, I'll spend around 2 hours with it. A euro for an hour of entertainment? I'd accept that. But it's free. No charge for your two hours of entertainment. If you like jump and runs of the cat mario (but much, much, much less punishing and frustrating) type you will enjoy this game and I recommend it to you.",

You have to win the game is a game where you don't really have to win the game. Follows the same formula as 'you die oh too bad atleast you know that's there!' like Dark Souls or Rogue Legacy. The game is not going too hard for that aspect though, it's not as hard as you'd expect but hey, there's a cat DLC! and it's also free!  The level progressing system will go like something from an atari or something you'd see on VVVVV, with every level having it's own different name and there's always something different. There are cash bags you can collect and i'm not really sure what you can do with them, but they are something you can go all like 'hey i want that!'  Since the game doesn't offer as much as an AAA game do, but it offers as much as a retro-atari game do, so in the old times this would be considered a full game, and i think that's great. This is a great game to relax from the flashy graphics we have nowadays and just sit back, hold tight and join the little nostalgia drive.",

Overall, You Have to Win the Game is a retro platformer while still keeping a realistic and nostalgic feel (both the television and the game).

At first glance i thought, thats a dull unneccessaryly hard game, with no soundtrack at all, just some effects. But what do you know - i gut hooked. The metroidvania-style and the fact, that you are unable to do anything but to walk and jump (with slight improvements later on) is that challenging, that you soon simply have to win the game. Without tunes and in the games darkness the feeling of isolation is creeping up on you, while trying to figure out jumping-patterns for solving the latest puzzle.   I died like a hundred times (or ... well ... make that eight hundred) in order to make a perfect game without succeeding. But, because there are save points everywhere, you can have one try after another - no boredom included. If you like it a bit (ha, ha - nice one) harder, then choose 'Yolo-Mode' for just one life and no saving points.  Anyway i would reccomend this title to anyone, who had fun with early NES (Famicom) titles like 'Castlevania' or 'Mega Man' or just want to have one or two hours of challenging fun.  ",

The game itself is hard, but it's 80s hard and not to such a degree that you feel like the game was a big waste of your time. When you finally win the game, you won't get a very flashy ending on your screen, but you'll feel a sense of pride regarding your accomplishment. Again like many 80s games, the satisfaction comes from the journey rather than the destination.  You will have your work cut out for you if you want to get all of the achievements, but it's do-able. All I can say is that I'm grateful for YouTube! Studying people's playthroughs on spots where you keep dying really helps!  The game is free, so you only spend your time on it and it's worth it. I recommend this game to gamers of the 80s and any other player who's up for a good challenge.",

This may seem small, but due to the unlock system (you collect orbs, which unlocks passages across the map) there is a  huge  amount of backtracking within the game. This is amplified by occasional teleports, which teleport you to an earlier section of the map from which you will  never  get back to where you were before.   This makes the game almost unplayable, and is the reason why I stopped playing. However, with the small change of adding a map, the game would instantly become so much better.  [Note: If you have a picture-perfect spatial memory or you are interested in drawing maps as you go through the game, this might not be a problem].  So no, I can't reccomend the game, even though it's free. Keep your $0 and buy something like VVVVVV (USD 4.99), which is a game so similar to this one that You Have To Win The Game would definitely be in homage to, heavily influenced by, or a ripoff, of it.

            "review_text": "You Have To Win The Game is a short retro platformer game designed to look as though it is being played on an old CRT monitor. The game is deliberately evocative of ages past, and contains various standard platforming puzzles.  Story   The game has no story.  Gameplay   At the start of the game, the character can do two things – move, and jump. Over the course of the game, the character also unlocks the ability to double jump and to wall jump, as well as activating red and blue walkway bricks; all four of these things open up new places for the player to go. The platforming starts out pretty easy, but gets progressively more difficult throughout the game. There are no bottomless pits in the game, but as per usual, there is lava and spikes.  Enemies in the game exist, but there are only a very small variety of them; however, this isn’t really a problem as the game is so short and the gameplay so basic. Touching any enemy is instant death, and there are fundamentally two kinds of “normal” enemies, creatures which crawl on the ground (snakes and crabs) and creatures which fly through the air (bats). In addition, there are a small number of unique monsters which spit out patterns of projectiles that the player must navigate through to win.  Most of the gameplay consists of exploring the environment, collecting all 64 money bags (though 5 of them are actually hearts instead, they serve the same purpose), unlocking all of the abilities, and navigating through to the end of the game, where there is a little mini-puzzle which allows you to “win” if you solve it. Winning or losing brings up a short message on screen, then sends you back to the beginning of the game without any upgrades, but all of the other collectibles remain collected.  The platforming is very basic, and overall the gameplay is very evocative of older platformer games, with very simple gameplay that isn’t anything special, but does what it needs to do. Unlike older platformers, are bells scattered throughout the game which serve as checkpoints, and their extremely high frequency means that the player is never sent back too far if they die; in this sense, the game is rather evocative of VVVVVV, in that the platforming deaths have little consequence because you can immediately try again, which is a good thing as it reduces frustration. The game gets to be fairly difficult by the end of it, but even still, the game is quite short; 100%ing the game took me under two hours, and to do that, you must beat it twice.  Graphics   The game is meant to look like it is being played on a computer out of the 1980s, and the game does a great job of achieving exactly that. This means, however, it isn't really very pretty to look at, though it is mostly reasonably clear what is going on; a few of the money bags are deliberately hidden by maching the surrounding colors closely, which is a somewhat questionable decision from the point of view of collectability, as all the others are simply hard to get to, whereas those two are easy to simply never see in the first place.  Final Summary   You Have To Win The Game is exactly what it promises to be – a retro platformer out of the 1980s. It isn’t the best platformer ever, but it is competent enough. However, there’s really nothing to recommend it either – if you miss out on this game, you aren’t missing anything from your life. If you get a free copy and are bored, you might get some enjoyment out of it, but there’s a reason games have moved on from such basic mechanics – they’re too limited to really grab you and leave you feeling as if you’ve done something new.
