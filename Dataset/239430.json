Using special high-tech gloves to manipulate cubes in the environment, the player solves an array of conundrums - from physics-based challenges; to 3D jigsaws; to platform-based trials.",

            "review_text": "I can only truly recommend this game if you've played the original.   There's controversy that this could have easily been released as DLC, but I'm not reviewing the politics of game admissions.  With the Director's Cut of this game comes a brand new narrative as well as a new soundtrack. They are both welcome additions to the game, alongside reworked puzzles, new secrets, and the previously released DLC. There's not a lot of extra things to see or do, but for a returning player who wants a bit more of the Q.U.B.E. universe, $5 isn't a big hole in the pocket.  However, the reason I prefer the original over this version is based on two things; the first being the actual lack of story in the original. There was almost a haunting mysteriousness to it, in the sense that you never truly understand the game as a whole. You pick up bits and pieces of things, formulating and speculating the who and what and where and when, but in the end, there were no concrete answers. These are the elements that made the game enjoyable for me beyond the gameplay. It was the time I spent wondering, 'what really is behind all of this?'  The second reason being the soundtrack. The original game has a much more upbeat, ambient electronic score. It's catchy, it's fun to listen to, and I found myself listening to it even outside of the game. While the new soundtrack isn't necessarily bad, as it has been tweaked to fit the new found atmosphere that coincides with the added narrative, it simply just isn't as memorable. There were a few tracks that I did enjoy, but in the end it cannot compare to what was.  If you haven't played Q.U.B.E. do yourself a favor and track down a copy of the original. It's a short, simple, but entertaining and involving. If you're a returning fan who doesn't mind throwing a fiver down to replay and re-experience the game in a different light, go for it. It's not the best five bucks you'll ever spend, but I personally don't have any regrets. It gave me an excuse to have some fun with it again, and most importantly enjoy myself. After all, isn't that the point?",

            "review_text": "Q.U.B.E is a game full of cubes in which you move cubes, jump on cubes, get tossed by cubes, choose the size of the cubes, into a room full of neutral cubes that are grey cubes unlike the other cubes that you move, jump on, choose size or get tossed by and those cubes are colored because cubes with colors are good cubes unlike Minecraft which is also a cube game but all of those cube things remind of portal because you're trapped in a huge cube and must go past those tests but portal doens't contain cubes that you jump on, move, get tossed by and choose size. The story reminds about the movie 'Cube' which there are some people trapped in a huge cube full of cubes that are rooms but cube shaped like walls and that's why it's called 'Cube' anyway in those little cubes you have different themes and ways to die and in the game 'Q.U.B.E' you don't die you just smash yourself with your keyboard (With cube shaped buttons) because you are trapped in a room and the cubes are bothering you but unlike in the 'Cube' movie which doesn't have anything to do with the game at all well the game doesn't have cube shaped rooms but it's built with cubes so you know.  I found a bug to get 'outside' and actually it's not a huge cube containing you, it's just a closed corridor built with cubes in space with no stars which aren't cube shaped like.  But I like this game because it's a great puzzle and you know cubes are good (Comes with a few bugs if you discover them).  11/10 would cube again.",

The new 'soundtrack' consists of sound effects and ambiance, not music. The original OST is far, far superior. The woman who dryly delivers exposition into your character's headset is monotone and annoying and it distracts from what little atmosphere there is. All of this combines to change a very fun, atmospheric game into sleep-inducing tedium. What could be more exciting than listening to a story read to you in a monotone voice with no music in a grey vertical shaft? Sigh. Just play the original. It's far, far better.",

I honestly don't like the Director's Cut better than the original. Maybe it was because I enjoyed the ambience of the game with its soundtrack playing and the light sounds of blocks shifting back and forth. Now they have added people speaking in the game. You never speak, some woman at the ISS speaks for you because your radio is broken and you can't send out, you can listen, though. All characters talk too much about faith and god when really I kind of just wanted to solve some puzzles. So the story is lackluster, gameplay feels a little better and would probably be extremely fun with the Oculus Rift, but the story still takes a bite into the gameplay. Also, there is a happy ending, you have no control over this. I would have felt better if the game sent me into a deep fryer than pushing me out in space like it did in the original.  All in all, it isn't bad, just feels a little more shallow even if it does have more stuff. There's a legitimate time trial and the voice actors feel human, but their portrayal feels off. It doesn't feel right for me, but hey, now we have new levels and we can try to beat the leaderboards.",

The basic gist of the game is that you have a pair of gloves that allow you push and pull blocks in and out of the walls of the strange location you are in. The game adds new mechanics throughout the experience to keep things fresh, and the puzzles are consistantly excellent. If you enjoy first-person physics puzzle games such as Portal and Quantum Conundrum, you'll undoubtedly like this. The Director's cut adds the previously released time trial DLC, and adds a storyline to the main campaign (the original Q.U.B.E. didn't have any kind of plot). The new story isn't anything earth-shattering, but it is interesting and the voice acting is very well done, so it's a pleasant addition to the game. In terms of gameplay differences, I believe they changed one or two of the harder puzzles (there was one I remember being extremely frustrated with in the original, but I didn't come across it in the director's cut), but it's mostly the same. Overall, this game comes highly reccomended for any fan of puzzle games.",

When I saw that there was a Director's Cut in my steam list I was a little excited because I imagined they might have balanced these puzzles a bit and maybe I could complete it myself this time? So I eagerly fired it up, but oh no. Ohhh noooo. It's like they had a competition to fit as many bad storytelling tropes as they could into a game that *doesn't have a story*. Now there's a poorly-acted disembodied voice in your ear telling you what to do. You have amnesiea. You've very important. Follow their instructions. Oh, and did I mention that they SPOIL THE ENDING WITHIN THE FIRST THREE MINUTES OF THE GAME.   I cannot for the life of me understand why anyone would have thought this was an okay thing to do. It's a horrible and unecesscary perversion to what was very nearly a perfect little game. Play the original, it's fantastic (right up to a point) but give this version of it a wide berth unless you're interested in a good example of how not to handle exposition.",

            "review_text": "I don't typically do reviews. But for all things I felt I should for this game. If you do not want spoilers do not expand this review.  8/10 Would get frustrated at the story again.  First off I do like this game, and unlike several of the top helpful negative votes, I have not played the previous version with no story.   However I do very much agree with their complaints vs. this rather plot-hole filled story line. One plot-hole of which bothered and irritated me so much I literally could not finish the game for a whole extra thirty minutes as I did everything in my futile power to try and stop the story from going the direction I was predicting. I will get to that and other cons later though, I will first explain why I still recommend it.  Pro's: Q.U.B.E. is a really brilliantly put together 3D Platform Puzzle game. It manages to make really visually interesting environments with the majority of it being made out of same sized cubes. It's lighting effects and background music &amp; sound effectively change how one feels about being in such a strange place throughout the game. Making the place feel oddly interesting to explore at first and then gradually becoming more and more unsettling and foreboding.   The puzzles are rather somewhat simple to figure out throughout the game (for me personally at least) however they did become more challenging at a good pace and were all still very fun to solve. Some were more difficult to a degree due to some quick switching you needed to do in order to get things where you wanted them. This was rather hard to do sometimes since your abilities are kind of slow to act. Its a good thing though because that slow activation sequence makes you rely on puzzle solving more than quick reflexes.  The controls are smooth and simple. It also doesn't explain any of them or how your powers work. I have this as a Pro because I find it rather annoying in games where they give you so much explanation on the controls it make you feel as if the game is mocking your intelligence. This also adds a small level of solving to the puzzles as well through trial and error.  Cons: The main story game is a little short, however this isn't much of a Con considering that there is a bunch of added stuff to do and the story wasn't all that well put together.   The story Is likely the biggest Con. I will go a bit in depth as to how it goes so don't read further if you don't want to know. It was an interesting Idea, but it came out rather painfully terrible.  So the story is you have no memory of who you are or why your here and two people who contact you throughout the game periodically try to influence you to either continue or stop. This is all rather moot though because the one who wants you to continue makes no sense and sounds like a liar from the get go, and the others demand is that you don't listen to her and do nothing to save your life. I say its moot because this really all wouldn't affect you in this situation anyway. You would solve the puzzles anyway because doing nothing wouldn't get you anywhere so the one argument you would never listen to and the other one doesn't need to try and get you to continue.  There is a point in their rather almost random poking around that they suddenly focus on faith and it suddenly becomes the whole thing the 'story' is about afterwards. This all rather becomes annoying at the end because they make it off as a 'Who do you trust?' only to make it so you can't choose. Not to mention the message this story conveys is that you should have complete blind faith in someone you don't really know. For reasons. It almost feels like you completely confirm that what you have is a gun in every way possible without actually firing it and then being told to shoot yourself in the face with it because that will save billions of lives including your own somehow. By the time you get to the end they create a logic conundrum. If you want to complete the mission, realistically in your mind, you would have to accept the person who has been trying to get you to complete it has been lying to you which, in turn, would make you not trust them enough to complete the mission. However as I stated you get no choice in the matter because there is only one route. Well there is only one route due to invisible walls and the developers lack of wanting you to fail the game. The last part is likely done because almost everyone who would play the game would fail it due to the fact you would likely not choose to complete the mission out of distrust. All in all the story is rather annoying, though interesting idea, that make the game frustrating at the end of the story.  Apologies, that last part ended up a bit of a rant. but that is how terrible the story is. The game is still good, it just has a painfully bad story. So if you like 3D Platform Puzzles like Portal then you would definitively like this game's mechanics.",

As the game progresses more interesting items appear such as coloured balls that need depositing in pits, rotating rooms, rooms with lightswitches (more interesting then it sounds) and the ability to change cubes to whatever colour you choose. Despite all these fun sounding mechanics, the game is visually a very sterile white consistently. While Portal was mostly sterile, there were moments where you had variations in the chamber and moments where you could go behind the chambers, in Q.U.B.E. it remains almost exclusively cold white rooms. Late in the game things break up a little , but not to a great extent.  The Director's Cut version adds both a narration via two characters talking to you via a radio, never fully being seen in game, and also changes some of the chambers layouts around. The naration helps to a degree as, with the first version, I found myself getting bored of the repetative rooms with no context. While it can be seen as a boon, it almost instantly breaks the late game twists by telling you right away what is going on, though it does provide a nice conflict for the player that is only answered at the end of the game.  A recommendation for a rainy day as (I'M MENTIONING PORTAL AGAIN) with the first Portal game it is very short. Grab it when on offer or when it hits an indie bundle. ",

There is also the option of doing time trial, if that's your kind of thing, but the game definitely has an end point and doesnt extend beyond that.

There's a real sense of mastery to the game design as you gradually learn to manipulate cubes to help you progress through the game. The learning curve feels just right.  Intriguing puzzles combined with a mysterious storyline (backed by excellent voice actors inc. Rupert Evans from The Man in the High Castle!) all keep you motivated to find out what happens next. The controls are simple and intuitive and if you get stuck, just spend a bit of time thinking - you're bound to figure it out eventually.  This was well worth the price for the experience - I haven't been this satisfied solving puzzles in a long time. I'll likely revisit this game when I get a VR headset.  My rating: 5/5",

Some of the puzzles are relatively easy to brute force, the magnetism based ones are pretty awful just in terms of design, and towards the end (both literally and figuratively) it starts to fall apart a bit but it ends pretty soon after so it's not too bad. Want a short-ish puzzle game with a story that's on the relatively inexpensive side? grab it this game's for you (also, the challenge puzzles are waaaay harder than anything in the main game if youre a puzzle afficianado). Looking for an extensive puzzle game or story to get wrapped up in for 15+ hours? this game is not for you, its relatively short and while the story is pretty good it's not meant to be a 'story' based game.",
