            "review_text": "It's a good game, and it's very unique compared to the rest of the LEGO games. Most levels last around 5-8 minutes, for starters, compared to the past were most levels averaged out like 15 minutes or so. Each 'world' consists of 15 levels, 5 story levels, 5 'post-story' levels, which are levels you play after finishing the story levels, and 5 bonus levels. I really enjoy the post story levels because you get to come back to the level after you beat it with everything changed after what happened in the story level. Take for example if you're playing a level, and something explodes near the end of it, when you come back, the level would be charred and burned from the explosion, which is super cool.  However, the fact that there's 6 'worlds' in this game makes the formula get a bit stale quickly. If you're an extreme LEGO lover, as well as a sandbox lover, I'd pick this game up. Otherwise, I'd pull out a chair and wait until this game goes on sale. I've only seen it on sale once...  8.5/10",
