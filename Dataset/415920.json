            "review_text": "As a short review I recommend this game. Instead of me listing pros and cons I’ll just leave some bullets and you can decide if you like that element or not.   Good KB/M support. Can rebind all keys. But, has a somewhat console-ish UI feel. Four member party generation Four races with basic racial ability/bonuses equivalent to Avrernum games Character development is through earning xp in a specific class and unlocking new classes. You can have two classes activated at any time, and the abilities granted by these classes.  There are three passive slots for slotting passive abilities you opened with classes. Can have three from one class or mix and match. Zelda like elements like picking through walls or shoveling to find secrets, etc. Gameplay, to me, seems like a jrpg developer tried to make a western like crpg in the vein of Dark Sun, Avernum, or Albion.  Crafting is extensive. Not extensive like in-depth and complicated, but extensive as in abundant.  For instance – you can put oil in an empty bottle, put an oily rag on the empty bottle and you have a Molotov cocktail.  To craft weapons you need the weapon manual/book thing and put it on an anvil then put the mat on it and Wala you have a crafted weapon.  Better mats make better weapons. Put a piston and rope together and you can climb down holes. Chop trees for wood, etc. I never really pay attention to story but the dialogue has been very brief so I have read what has been said. Story, so far, doesn’t seem to be the focus of the game. Lot of exploring. Very restricted equipment slots. You have two weapon/item slots and three other slots for armor and two trinketish items (like a necklace and goggles, or a cloak and hipflask for example. Combat is decent. I don’t think it is mind blowing os far, but I’m not all that far into the game. I would say it is a ring above Avernum, but not at the level of ToEE (in my opinion). On par with Knights of the Chalice. Combat does not have action points - you have a movement option and attack option like Antharion, ToEE, Knights of the Chalice, etc. No bugs so far; seems pretty rock solid  My opinion – this game is good and well worth the money, even at full price, for fans of crpgs willing to try a game that isn’t your standard fair. The game probably won’t blow your mind but it has enough content and meat to justify the price. Its not the best at anything, but it is also far from the worst. It has all the gameplay elements I look for in a crpg and I do not regret this purchase at all and feel safe recommending it to all crpg fans at full price.",

The game is also full of secrets that need finding, including burried treasures, hidden bosses, short cuts, and even a village at one point. I know for a fact that I didn't find everything my first play through, and , without giving away too much, they do make it worth playing through more than once. This is honestly one of my absolute favorite games.",

            "review_text": "Such a great game! I went in just wanting some Final Fantasy Tactics style classes/leveling, but got so much more! It has all of the fun class/character building of Final Fantasy Tactics, plus the exploration of a CRPG like Icewind Dale. I just completed it and unlocked a few minor things, so there may be some replayability aside from playing different class combinations.  The only cons are that the story is somewhat interesting but pretty lacking. I'm not sure if I missed something in the game, but I couldn't read half of the dialogue because it was in a different in-game language. There are also a few bugs that completely halted progress, but I was able to find guides from the developer on how to bypass them.",
