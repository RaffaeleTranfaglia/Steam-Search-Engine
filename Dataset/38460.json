The game follows the adventures of Kurt Hectic, a janitor who uses a chaingun with a limitless supply of bullets and a sniper rifle, Max, a six legged dog who smokes cigars and wields four guns, and Dr. Fluke Hawkins who utilises his intelligence to make materials to fix his problems. The game makes you go through 10 levels of killing aliens, giants aliens, and puzzle solving. Positive/s: The combat system is excellent Each of the three characters play differently, requiring different strategies to get through each level. Kickass music. Entertaining aliens and bosses A silly but entertaining story.  Overall a very fun and entertaining game.  9 out of 10",
