            "review_text": "Overall - Recommendation with Caution regarding Value for Money / Amount of Content. Strong atmospheric game with effective but somewhat limited characters, decent gameplay mechanics and heavy adventure / discovery focus. However, short for the price with low replay motivation.  Setting, Atmosphere, Sound and Graphics. The game is set aboard a retro-futuristic space vessel, think the first Alien film crossed with Bioshock 1 and you have a good idea. This is executed EXTREMELY well; the tech styles, music and overall visual aesthetic all build a convincing and engaging environment. The game is very pretty, and is a pleasure to play in.  Whilst the game might not have the ridiculous lighting effects of AAA titles, it is still very well done and not TOO expensive in terms of power. My gaming potato of a laptop can run it on max with only occassional frame loss, so if you can run titles such as Fallout 4 or Witcher 3 on low-medium you should be absolutely fine. Naturally older machines should be wary, as always.  Characters The active characters of the game is limited to Yourself and The Ship's aging AI, Kaizen; plus crew members existing in text-based system logs. Whilst Kai's responses are essentially keyword oriented, and somewhat limited in their breadth, this little computer readily comes accross as a person. A character with depth, complexity, history. And all through little 3-4 line text responses. It also changes it's behaviour with regards to how you treat it. For example: A locked door it refuses to open. You can repeat the command over and over, treating it like the dumb machine it is! It will eventually open, but won't be too happy about it. This will require several repeat commands, ignoring it's gentle nudges to be more personable towards it. Or you can simply say 'please'. Develop the relationship with the AI, and it will change the way it addresses you from 'Human' to 'Partner' or 'Friend'. And it worries about you. Later in the game, you need to do something putting yourself in danger - and if you are friendly with the AI, it will try to stop you and require convincing to let you go. It feels like a true character, and offers one of the best experiences I've had in recent times.  Gameplay The mouse controls are. Well. Questionable. But they work, once you get used to them. The keyboard option exists, but it makes the terminals toggle on/off as you interact with them, rather than be always on as you walk past. I found it better to just get used to the Mouse controls. In terms of actual gameplay, there is little more to do than walking searching simulator, delving into computer logs and debating with the AI. It's not a huge amount to do, but is fun whilst it lasts - if you value story highly, this game stands strong. If you want a face full of non-stop action, this might not be for you.  Value, Experience Summary Let's get this out of the way. It's short. REALLY short for £15. I beat the first playthrough, with a moderate amount of log diving and AI small talk, in 1HR 55MIN. If I were to search out every secret, I anticipate this would be more like 3 or 4HR, but still not loads for the price. The replayability is also limited. Whilst it can be fun doing one run where you are friendly to the AI, and one hostile, there is little to do beyond this. You can interact with the systems in different ways (Asking the AI to do it, executing the scripts yourself etc.) but the core game path remains unchanged, with only variations on how you approach accessing areas. So this is my biggest Buyer Beware on this title: The Amount of Content.  HOWEVER. What there is is first rate. I had an absolute blast playing this, I loved chatting with the AI and by the end of I would consider it one of my closer in-game friends - I certainly felt more attached to it than to many AAA titles' companions.  Closing Words This game is certainly not the best game I've ever played. But ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ if it's not an intriguing start, and if the developers were to build something like this on a larger scale I would be all over it like a bad rash. Whilst I finished the first playthrough within the 2HR steam refund time, and had the option to get my money back, I am glad I did not.  I look forward to seeing where these Devs go in the future. Nice work, folks.",

            "review_text": "The game is quite interesting and the old 80's style computers actually bring me back to the tandy PC and macintosh I used as a kid. (Yes, I know, im old. I have probably forgotten more about computers then most of you will ever know). In many ways I love the game, and interacting with Kaizen the computer is a concept I have always found interesting. In other ways the computer is just a program in which you see a programers holy grail as you notices small bits of humanity in it. Then again, is it.  (Caution, I am not trying to give away to much but some information past this point could be a spoiler)   The game itself is nothing more then a solution finder with a few brief moments of action to beat the oxygen clock. Half the game is looking around for clues and the other half talking to Kaizen trying to convince it for hints or information. The game itself is quickly played and the gameplay for all endings changes little until the end. You can play threw near the end then just create a save point to return to just to see all the different endings to have to avoid playing threw what you have already done again.  I recomend this game as a good quick puzzle when its on sale. It is a good concept and opens the question to how much control should an AI be given in real life and how will people actually use it to keep control of others. It brings back fond memories and even has hints of HAL from yes that old movie. The downside of this game is its quickly over to soon. The puzzles, though some could be difficult is not much of a match and the solutions to many things is litteraly written on the walls. The plot is put together by remembering what little you can find of the old crew members from articles left behind and logs which you must carefuly put together yourself. And the ending is simply what you say and do at the end. Though there is several endings, it seems repetitive to play through the game again to see each ending, but then again, the game is short.  For me, this was less of a game and more of a interactive movie. I wish it had more to its plot, was longer to play through and had more on the characters. Maybe with time more will be added. I recomend this game to those who like a good puzzle and pays attention to details, but just like a movie, once its over, you know it. Not much point to do it again for a while. I would recommend it but be picky on your expectations with this one.",

It was easy to feel like I was on a real spaceyacht, and everything was tied together very well. A lot of sci-fi/space games just plaster everything with flashy lights, but this felt like each room had a purpose and was designed that way. I could almost picture the backstory playing out in each room, and there were subtle things the devs did (intentionally or not) to aid in telling the story.  The AI was very convincing, too. It felt like I was actually having a conversation with it sometimes. I even caught myself saying things like 'Open this door, please.' or 'Thanks, Kaizen.' It being so believable really helped me get immersed in the game. Like a good book that you can't put down.  The only downside I can point out is it's a little short. Got to one of the endings in a little under 2 hours. But! There's multiple endings so it's something I can play a few times still.  All-in-all, I bought this during a sale, but if I knew how well-made this game was, I'd have gladly paid full price. Hat's off to the devs on this one.",

            "review_text": "You’re the only survivor of a space crash, and you’re picked up by a mysterious ship. The ship’s AI asks you for a suspicious favor, and you’re drawn into an Adventure Game with some very unusual twists. Solving problems means talking to the computer, and Event[0] lets you type anything you want, talking to the AI with total freedom. How you behave will change how it treats you, though.  The best parts of Event[0] are when the AI’s responses are wonky. Under the hood, it’s a robust chatbot that can misread what you say and give inappropriate answers – but it also has a personality, and soon you won’t be sure if the AI is giving the wrong answer because it’s incompletely programmed, or because it’s hiding something. And throughout, it expresses such concern for keeping you alive that, if it does have something else going on, it’s one of the best AI characters in gaming history.  I’m not big on Adventure Games, and a couple of times I was stuck because I didn’t know where the game wanted me to look. However most of it is a fascinating process of exploration, both of the abandoned ship, and of the information you can get the AI to cough up. These sections are comparable only to Her Story’s teasing out of additional context and data, but there aren’t so few major plot points that you can accidentally stumble across. It’s enlivening to figure things out with this computer.  The biggest drawback is that, a few days since launch, the game has loading bugs. It stutters when it has to make major changes to physical objects, and it’s crashed three times for me in loading. But if you’re reading this in a couple weeks, it’s probably been patched. It’s getting daily support updates at present.  For all my praise, this is a game for people with patience and who enjoy It’s not just a Walking Sim, but if you felt Dear Esther Gone Home were too short and stole your money, then you’ll probably be mad at Event[0]. There’s more to explore, and messing with the AI provides more engagement than the average Walking Sim, but it’s still a short experience that will take most people 2-3 hours, with additional time if you want to get the alternative endings. They’re brilliantly different.",

            "review_text": "Although the concept of a chatbot in a game is interesting and worth exploring, I think Event[0]'s Kaizen falls short of what's really needed for a more natural kind of interaction. Kaizen's motivations are enigmatic, it doesn't really have a personality to speak of beyond its authoritative-but-conversational tone, and these gaps in its character make it hard to understand what it wants and what it will react to.  There were several instances during gameplay when I would ask Kaizen about something that it had just mentioned, and then get an unrelated response back. Other times, it felt like Kaizen wasn't really parsing what I was saying, it had just been scripted to assume that I would ask about Recent Topic A. These problems are noticeable because the game wants you to converse with Kaizen in natural language, therefore you have the expectation that it can understand what you're saying. Shortcomings in language parsing can be hidden with the normal verb-object inputs of interactive fiction — 'tell (me about) black hole' is an ambiguous command, so ambiguous feedback is annoying but to be expected. But Kaizen's natural language input implies a level of specificity that is very hard for any bot to deliver.  The game wants to be an exploration game where you have an AI companion that tells you all about what you're seeing, but getting any kind of lore out of Kaizen is tough. There are only sparse details about the crew, the ship, the technology you're seeing, and the politics of the game's universe. You would expect reams of this stuff to be in Kaizen's memory, since that kind of information would be necessary context for a conversational AI. Because you can't get lore or personality out of Kaizen (aside from log files, which collectively tell about one paragraph worth of plot exposition), you just go about your tasks because there's not much else to read or look at. I never got invested in the plot of the game because the bulk of the experience was just following directions whose rationales were only barely explained.  So yeah, it's a cool experiment that falls short in chasing an ambitious goal. If you are disappointed because you really really wanted to chat with a game character, you owe it to yourself to play Emily Short's 'Galatea', which was made in 2000 and still has the most robust game NPC to this day.",

Finally, the AI, sure it has conversations with you, but it's nothing cleverbot couldn't have done five years ago. the conversations don't really flow at all and sometimes the responses from the computer don't relate at all to what you said. So, overall, good game and good game concept, but a few things that should've been adjusted before release.  66/100",

You don't move with WASD, instead you move with left/right click for forward/back. It's incredibly awkward.  It crashed after the intro for me the first time, so I switched to windowed so it could work after waiting 5 minutes (a rather long loading time for a game). But then looking around was very blurry and FPS laggy on lowest settings.",
