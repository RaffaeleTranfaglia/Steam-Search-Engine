            "review_text": "Whatever you think this game is gonna be, that's pretty much what it is...though perhaps a smidgen harder and a tad more aesthetically accomplished (it does look and sound awful pretty).   Given the game's premise and the fact that it's free, I really can't see much for anyone to complain about; but just how many hours of enjoyment you will get out of what is essentially highly repetitive and brain-frying 'entertainment' is up to the individual. One definite plus: if you do find this game endlessly enjoyable, there probably is a real job out there for you fixing electrical equipment, because it's pretty much just twiddling dials 'til the signal works and the cows come home.   In short, I do respect this game for how well-made it is, but I already have a 'challenge' comparable to it in my day-to-day existence, called 'Trying To Work Out How To Fix The Problems Caused By The Latest Windows 10 Update, In Order To Make My Computer Function As It Did Before'. Trust me, you don't wanna put me in an electronics shop, as I will SMASH ALL THE TVS and KILL ALL THE CUSTOMERS.    That's just me, though. You probably should just try it out for yourself.  Verdict: 7/10.",
