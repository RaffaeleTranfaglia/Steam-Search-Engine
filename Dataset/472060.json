The interface and tutorial could be better, as it took a while to learn what was going on, but a  solid game otherwise.  You can right click cards to read what they do. I don't believe the game tells you this though.  Neat game otherwise though.",

Build a custom deck, or go with a pre-made one (Land and Army heavy, Intrigue, etc.), and defeat your opponents to claim the Throne (er, table)! For free-fiddy-free, you can't really go wrong giving this a shot, especially if you dig medieval games, card games, or strategy. I'd recommend giving it a go. I'd safely say this game won't be for everyone (which one is?) but, hell, it's FREE to play/try :)",

The Politics is a fun feature, although it's frustrating that it's completely reliant on whether or not you have the right cards. It's practically dumb luck. Definitely worth a download, and it's great with a couple friends. But, the cards are lame-looking, and could use a re-design. Definitely one I'll keep playing onward.",
