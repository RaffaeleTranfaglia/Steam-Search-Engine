            "review_text": "Steamworld Dig is a bit like a cross between Motherlode, Spelunky and a metroidvania. Motherlode because the game owes a lot to the concept of digging down into the earth, mining minerals and then selling them on the surface for gold to buy upgrades, which then enable you to dig deeper, take on more enemies etc. Spelunky because the main levels are procedurally generated, and the general feel of your character is quite similar to Spelunky (so much so that playing one after the other causes quite a bit of confusing pressing the wrong buttons!). Metroidvania because there are various caves that are set puzzles scattered throughout the main mine shafts, and completing them gives you upgrades that allow access to previously inaccessible areas. It's a compelling formula polished to a fine sheen here. There's a lot more depth (ho ho) to this game than first appears. I definitely dug it. In fact I'd say it's oresome. Ok, ok, I'll stop.",

It's a completely unique and original exploration-based platformer that brings back memories of Dig Dug, Terraria, and the classic 'Metroidvaina' formula. Mixing a very plesant presentation, a well-implemented upgrade system, and most of all, an incredibly addictive risk/reward element that permeates through the entire gameplay experience, Steamworld Dig is a winner all around. I only wish it had been a bit longer, as I wanted the game to go on and on, but in the end, what better sign of a resonant game is there? Highly recommend this one!",

Before I bought this game, I'm worrying to the game is too simple and too hard achievements.  But not!     The story is not a big deal but, there are enough tales about the past and mystery for I enjoyed the game.    The game mechanism seems like simple but,  THIS WAS NOT  boring simple.    I don't know why but, I really like the Bots'  (characters')  voices. That sounds are really like as talking but, rather robotic or computer communications. I respect that developer who's made that sounds. Really good work, I think.    The designs are really awesome! All background of worlds match their stories and either of all worlds music! And one more thing about the musics that I didn't bore hearing all the time. So, another respect that developer who created those musics!     Good things:   -Really good voice and sound effects.  -Awesome designs and background stories.  -I enough enjoy the game-play and musics. The musics are awesome!   -To the achievement hunters: The achievements are not so hard, maybe except one, the   [Master Prospector] . But, I guess to not impossible hard, I could obtain that the by my second play-through, although I used the  [ALT+F4]  trick.     Bad thing:   -Just a few times frozen the game soon as I launched so, I didn't last much things.  -Spoiler Alert! But I'm not sure about that.   At the end I was a little bit sadly but, I dont know why, Rusty  (main character)  didn't come back of the underground and don't know why. I guess it is not exactly happy-end. So, I couldn't decided whether dramatic or other else end.      I recommend this game those who like nice sci-fi stories, mysteries and the simple  (but do not boring simple)  game-play.",

            "review_text": "SteamWorld Dig is a very charming game about a robot digging for treasures in a Wild West scenario. The gameplay is an interesting mix of digging, platforming, some light puzzling and uncovering secrets while fighting some enemies here and there. One thing this game does really well is offering new gameplay elements at exactly the right times, keeping itself from getting stale. Over time you can unlock new abilities, which you can also upgrade that make the digging, traversing through the tunnels and fighting easier and more fun. The level design for some areas differs considerably from the rest, which results in quite a few surprises along the way. My first playthrough took me about 10 hours, but the game can apparently be completed in less than 2 ½ hours according to one of the achievements, but that requires some serious rushing, which I'm personally not a fan of.  In conclusion: I had a great time with this game and highly recommend it!",

That in and of itself is worth a recommendation, as my gaming attention span is difficult to hold. But I digress.   The gameplay boils down to, well, digging and exploration. If you don't particularly value exploration and collection, I don't think this game is right for you. Digging to new depths, collecting Ore to sell, and gaining valueable upgrades is most of what you'll be doing.   The graphics are very pleasant; it has a distinct, vibrant aesthetic that I very much enjoyed.  However...  - Feels short (~4 hours). Left me longing for more game. - Combat was somewhat frustrating. Thankfully, it's not to frequent. - Gameplay is somewhat tedious, with digging and returning to town to replenish light / looking to replenish resources.  Still, overall I enjoyed the game, especially considering I got it in a $1 Humble Bundle. The recommendation is contingent if you enjoy these types of games, however. I think I'd rate it as a 7.5/10.",

            "review_text": "SteamWorld Dig is an Arnold Palmer of Dig Dug and good old Metroidvania. The gameplay is solid if not a bit too straightforward: you dig. You will dig for gold to buy upgrades that will allow you to dig more efficiently, and so the vicious cycle will continue. There is some light combat, exploration, and platforming involved and it all plays out rather nicely.   I really only tend to complain when games drag out, but SteamWorld seemed to just rush through itself. I almost feel like SteamWorld invited me over to play Legos, but then at the last second got insecure and just decided to rush through all the fun stuff rather than just enjoy a decent amount of time together. It’s really hardly a complaint, it is more of a backhanded encouragement: you were a nice little gem, I just wish there was more of you.    For the time that SteamWorld does stick around it is strangely enjoyable. I think I may actually have some fun with a digging simulator as this game managed to convince me that digging could be fun and wasn’t just for mining nerds. There is definitely some combat and exploration, and I do remember a bit of a challenge here or there.  This is not a life changing game, but it is well oiled and worth a bit of your time. I can recommend it on sale for those don’t expect Guacamelee. ",

            "review_text": "Skipped the 3DS eShop release, then I found out that this HD re-release hit Steam, so I got this version and went in to the experience blind.  Honestly, this is one of the bigger pleasent surprises of 2013. At first the game feels like it shares a lot in common with Terraria, but as you advance further in it also shares a flavor of Metroid, with encouraged exploration and a gradual progression of upgrades, both purchased through exchanged loot or at key juncutres in the game.  The goal of the game is to dig as far down as you possibly can, frequently re-emerging at the top to purchase supplies and gear before venturing even further. It sounds tedious, but surprisingly hooks you in and gives you that sense of real progress as you dig down mile upon mile, environment changing and hazards growing more deadly.  What sets this game apart from the likes of Terraria, and what I find the most appealing about the game, is that the whole time you are working toward directed goals, instead of being left to your own devices. You can explore the caverns and go slightly off the beaten bath in search for treasure and loot, but the whole time you're inching toward the end of the inevitable pathway you carve out.  It took me 6 hours to beat on my first playthrough, but the game itself features randomly-generated mines with each new save slot, giving you incentive to revisit the game and try it again with an unfamiliar layout. Highly recommended.",

The mobs get progressively harder and the terrain harder to navigate.There is a little story line and caves to explore which are fun and different depth to dig down to.

            "review_text": "This game is a platform mining adventure with Metroidvania elements. One might compare it to Terraria where you can dig the ground for mineral ores, but unlike Terraria, the ores cannot be used to build things, instead they are sold for upgrades used to facilitate the players' trek deep into the mines. As you dig deeper, you'll find dungeons that give you extra powers, or extra ores or both that helps you explore the mines even further. You'll also discover caves, and larger structures as you dig. This emphasis on mining for valuable ores and underground exploration, coupled with the ability to place torches, ladders and explosives, as well as the random generation of mines every time you start a new game puts it closer to Spelunky than anything else. However, unlike Spelunky, you don't have to worry about losing your pick axe or dying too much, since you can simply be reassembled for half your money, and you can easily pick your ores back up again.  This game has a lot of things going for it. Just the setting alone capured my interest. You play as Rusty, a steampunk robot in a Western style setting who had just inherited the mines from his now-deceased uncle. Your task then, is to take up his mantle and explore the mines yourself and find out what he was up to before he bought the farm. The game world features beautiful sprite work and a charmingly cute art style that is very reminiscent of modern 2-D sprite platform games. The gameplay is also pretty cathartic and relaxing with how easy it is to get into and how unstressful it is. The idea of carving your own underground world is also pretty attractive. The porting job done from the 3DS to Steamworks is also pretty nice as it works really nicely with an XBox 360 or simillar controller out of the box and there are no stretching or forced aspect ratio involved. It actually looks very crisp and clean with no artifacts of resizing to be found.  However, there may be some things that could put off potential buyers from picking this game up. For one, the game is really short, lasting 5 hours on average or 7 if you're thorough like me. The combat can be pretty awkward due to the randomly generated nature of the mines placing some enemies in awkward places to fight, and as far as boss fights go, there is just the one toward the end. Some people might also be disappointed by the lack of challenge often associated with a game with Metroidvania elements.  All the same, I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun single-player casual mining platformer adventure to pass the time. The randomly-generated nature of the mines means that there is quite a lot of replay value to be had with this game. For just 10 Dollars, you can definitely do much worse than pick this game up.",

The main gate is money, as it should be with miner types, and you will pretty smoothly gain more abilities to get more minerals to get more stuff to get more abilioties etc.   The only thing that I would improve is to have some post-game content as the main adventure will only take 3-4 hours to get through. Either a new game plus mode or some kind of randomized post game mine just for the fun of the mining would greatly add to the replay value.  As it stands tho it is a very good little game and well worth the money and time to play it though. Gamepad is reccomended but not required.",

There is one boss battle to end the game, which while a little bland, works well with the mechanics and offers a high note to end your adventure on.  This IS Motherload. But what's wrong with it?  Well, my biggest gripe, albeit cosmetic, is that none of the upgrades change your character. Visually you'll finish the game the same way you started (minus the three weapons). One of the biggest pulls to the old Motherload game was how each upgrade made a visually significant impact/improvement, which was sorely missed from the characterisation of this game. The townsfolk even mention how much your character has apparently changed.   Also, as other reviewers have mentioned, this game can be seen as short, and there isn't much replay value. You get ranked based on deaths, money earned, etc., so if you really feel like playing again to get gold (and acheivements), then you'll get at least one more run for your money. If you know Motherload, you know exactly what you're getting, and you'll be pleasently surprised with the innovations this game brings to the table, but you might want to wait until a sale to buy it.  In short:  I enjoyed this game very much. It is a golden example of its genre and I would highly recommend it tothose who know what that is. To those looking for Terraria, Dwarf Fortress, a 'Metroidvania' or whatever other games you think this is like, this is not like that. There is no crafting, no building, and you only attack to survive. This is a game about digging down, mining for money, and buying upgrades to survive digging further. Good luck, 'pardner.",

The characters are likable and the story, while not original, isn't bad. Like I said before the game isn't very difficult, the times I died were due to my own impatience or lack of paying attention, and the only penalty for death is half your money, which is no big deal as by the end game money comes in fairly easy.    The main mechanic of the game is to explore underground and mine for precious ore while trying to discover what happened to Rusty's, the main characters, uncle. You bring the ores back to the surface and sell them to buy upgrades, that in turn allows you to reach new areas. After you get deep enough that trecking back to the surface is a chore, you discover teleport pads that take you right back to the surface, and when your done with the shops return you to where the pad is underground. There are a few pads already placed but you can buy your own and place them where you wish as well.

            "review_text": "SteamWorld Dig is a fun little game that blends Metroidvania-esque ability progression with the platforming and money management of a mining game. You play a robot drawn to a dusty Western mining town, who discovers his miner uncle has died and left him a hole in the ground. Your goal: get to the bottom of it.  The game has a great visual style and I found the core mechanics engaging, if more than a little repetitive. It was fun for a playthrough. However, I don't think it's a home run game.  My first complaint is the story. The world of SteamWorld Dig is a neat one--a world where steam-powered robots are the dominant civilization, and some untold catastrophe has left humans trapped under the earth. But the driving plot of the game is thin to the point of being unsubstantial. Supposedly, you dig deeper in order to figure out just what your uncle was up to, but as a player, I didn't care a lick about that. I was digging just to dig.  A more compelling plot would have provided me with reason to care about my uncle and what he found. Since the mechanics of the game encourage an obsession with digging deeper, tying an insatiable urge to dig into the character of the uncle would have made him more sympathetic, and caused the story to resonate better with the gameplay. As it stands, I entirely ignored the 'plot' of the game, and I feel the lack of a story detracted from the experience.  Secondly, SteamWorld Dig seems to me to have very little replay value. Your mileage may vary if you're inspired by achievements and the idea of speedrunning, but for me, once I reached the bottom, attained all the various skills, and maxed out most of my stats, I had no reason to play the game again. That's because the game's progression is almost entirely linear, with very few challenges requiring backtracking or use of your new abilities (as one might expect from a Metroidvania game). What's more, unless you are very bad at money management, there are next to no branching options for character development in the game; you can upgrade your pickaxe  and  your other tools  and  other attributes, without ever having to choose a trade-off. And given the finite amount of resources in the game, there's very little point to returning to a finished game for more mining--eventually, you will have mined all there is to mine.  This could have been solved in a number of ways. Inserting more optional high-level challenges at the beginning of the game would reward backtracking and would make the acquisition of new skills feel like more of an accomplishment. Offering more upgrade options, or otherwise making stat boosting feel like more of a meaningful choice, would reward playing through multiple times to experience different 'builds'. And a New Game+ mode that added new or more difficult enemies and additional challenges would have brought a welcome amount of replay value.  This isn't to say SteamWorld Dig is a bad game. Like I said, I enjoyed it when I was playing it. But I think it's a  thin  game--good for a few hours of enjoyment, but not anything worth returning to once you've finished it.

It's definately a game worth checking out for the common platforming fan, just for how cheap it is when compared to the gameplay. (The gameplay is amazing for the price!)

The gameplay of this game sounds simple, but it actually has a lot of content. You start out in Tumbleton, a town with a population of 3. You need to get down in the randomly generated mine, dig deeper, find resources and then find your way back to sell them and repeat. In this game you use 2 resources, not counting life, which are water and light. While you are in the caves, you will need light, if not you will die. You need to get ouside or atleast to a source of light. Water is used for more complex functions like the drill, the steam jump or your weapon, the mechanical fist. As you go deeper you can find more valuable resources from ''Trashium'' to diamonds, Uranium and even Dark Matter. However as you go deeper the ground becomes harder to mine as well, so you will have to go to the upgrade store where you can purcashe a stronger pickaxe, armor, lantern, water tank and inventory upgrades, ladders, dynamite, lamps and even teleporters. When you sell ores, you gather experience and rewards for each level up. As the game progresses, two new robots will join the town which sell advanced equipment and upgrades. In the caves you will find doors that lead to ''dungeons'' which give special rewords if completed: double-jump, a drill, a mechanical fist, sprint and steam jump. At the bottom you will find a door leading to the second biome which is something like a swamp, and finally the third biome, each with new enemies and new traps like lasers, TNT, spikes, etc. Too bad, this game is short, you can finish it in 2-3 hours. The final boss is really challenging.  The graphics look amazing. It has a unique art style which is one of the best I have ever seen. Also the effects and the HUD are great. The soundtrack is nice as well, the sound is relaxing and it has a western feel.  I recommend this game, very interesting, fun and it has amazing graphics, 9/10.  ",

With this money you can then buy all sorts of upgrades that will help you explore even deeper into your uncle's mine and find more valuable ore. Even though it may seem that all you do is digging, there is actually a really cool story that unfolds as the game progresses.  The game also allows for different styles of gameplay. You can try to go through the game as fast as you can, or you can take your time and try to collect every single piece of loot you can find. While playing the game I have also found a few bugs. However, they are really minor so I'm not going to nitpick about them.  All in all, Steamworld Dig is a really fun game and I would recommend it to anyone.

The game revolves around using digging devices (throughout the game you find more) to keep mining the gems under the town and fend off enimies. While there are enimies, that isn't the highlight of the game. You keep getting upgrades of your digging devices as well throughout the game.  If you die, you drop all the gems you are carring and are returned to town. You loose 50% of your gold as well, so you want to avoid this. The first time through you might find yourself digging down faster than you should. It is wise to plan ahead so you can always get back up to sell those precious gems.  While at first there might not be much stratigy, as stated above you do need to be careful just digging down and fast. Plan ahead, so you have tunnels that you can use to your advantage. Thera are consumable's you can use to help out, but I found them not very useful. I found spending my money on upgrades more worth the money.  There are 3 diffrent 'types' of mning areas you go through. They get progresivly harder to mine, but the game overall isn't very challanging.  Overall I would recomend the game.

            "review_text": "It is apparently a Metroid-influenced game, but I haven't played Metroid. It is also quite like Terraria due to the mining down and collecting precious stones. In SteamWorld Dig there is considerably less emphasis on open-world exploring and extreme numbers of items to collect, and more of an obvious storyline.  I found the game good fun. Unlike the beginning of Terraria, it was obvious what to do, and I was clear on my next goal. Roll into town with population 3, talk with the NPCs, then down the mine and start hacking away. The NPCs have exaggerated personalities, which is to be expected I suppose, and are rather obvious and traditional in their roles. It would have been nice to mix things up a bit. As I dig further down, I found quickly that it pays to go horizontally more than vertically, and any vertical movement needs to be carefully planned. Even with the higher jump and other power-ups collected later on, it can still be very difficult to go back up without a little forethought. Rusty can only dig one space up, and cannot dig while jumping.  I was pleased that the pause screen displayed the current keys to use - this made it easy to quickly check how to change objects to place, rather than accidentally placing an object. The inventory is straightforward and provides all the information required while playing. It is possible to further inspect the inventory and reject items, but I haven't needed to do that. The movement and hit zones for Rusty are reasonable. I was frustrated occasionally by digging the wrong space, just because I was slightly off centre over the top of rocks. The map is very useful in seeing where I'd been, and what's coming up. Displaying the number of strikes required to mine the default rocks as separate levels was very helpful. I would have liked a way to see the current goal again - new goals pop up in a red banner once the previous goal is achieved, but I haven't found a way to see the goal again.  Overall a pleasant game, simpler and more straightforward than Terraria, but with reasonable progression and some small choices to be made between available upgrades. I would recommend this game as a casual game, as a small amount of time invested can give a good return. For more complex or open-ended exploration and building, Terraria is the way to go. SteamWorld Dig is a fun way to pass some time.",

Despite the lack of a procedural world, the game still has a fair bit of replayablity due to the flexibility of the mining system and the ability to buy upgrades in different orders.

It's a great game, but there is not enough to it to warrant your time/money. I managed to get the game during a steam sale so I only paid $5, but I'm still not sure I got my money's worth.

            "review_text": "Steamworld Dig reminds me of another game, a game that this game was probably inspired by, and a game that, unlike Steamworld Dig, is free. Motherload. Motherload had the concept of you being on... Mars, I believe? You're given a machine to mine for ores, you sell the ores for money, you buy upgrades. The difference was that Motherload was actually good.  Steamworld advertises itself as a 'platform mining adventure'. Well, it has mining, it has terrible platforming, and its a very boring adventure. It seems to be trying to have some steampunk western feel, but its just that. A feel. The western part feels poorly thrown in so that there wasn't more steampunk crap on the market, but as far as the game is concerned, it is very steampunk robot, and the only 'western' part is that the main hub is a very 'kid's cartoon version of a wild west town' town, and you got a cowboy hat. Yes, this is very western. The platforming, as said, is bad. Until you get a certain upgrade, you can suffer fall damage, which can hurt your 'adventures' until you get it. Why fall damage in a platformer? Motherload also had fall damage but 1) It was not a platformer, 2) It gave you rockets from the start to get yourself out of a hole and to soften your fall. Here, you're expected to waste valuable orbs on teleporters, buy cheap ladders, which you can only carry 5 of at a time, or make your own 'platforms', but if you got some TNT nearby, or a creature/robot that destroys tiles, then oh no, your platforms are gone.  Motherload had a world that made sense. Sure, its final boss might have been something people didn't want/expect from that game of mining resources, but as you gain more valuable minerals, you could reasonably say you can sell them and expect a paycheck, since you're working for a corporation that has enough money to pay for you and another miner. In Steamworld Dig, you get a mine in a failing town, yet the town always has enough money to buy your full-to-the-brim inventory of diamonds, worth about 500 gold each. Why is this town paying me for ♥♥♥♥ it ain't using, when it could use the infinite money it has to improve its town? Nitpicky? Maybe, but Motherload had a believable world, where as this world is just... ehhh.  This game involves something terrible. Backtracking. You'll have to go back to old zones, or back to the main hub at times during the game's 'story', so some random woman robot can tell you something you already figured out. There's a bunch of lasers blocking your way, and you already had to deal with lasers before by destroying their generator? Nope. You gotta go back to town so she can tell you what you already figured out. Speaking of story, its not a very good one from what I've seen. 'Oh hey, your uncle is dead, and there's this strange stuff below the mine that gives you upgrades, I wonder what it was all for' repeat ad nausem. I'm feeling like I'm near the end of the game, and there's nothing like a journal entry to give me a hint of what's happening soon. Why my uncle was keeping this tech a secret. It's just... tech. That no one knows about, that gives me upgrades, and no reason for its secreacy. I'm hoping that if I continue to play this game, I get an answer to that, but for now, the story just doesn't advance. You just get upgrades, and people talk about how odd the upgrades are, and nothing happens.  $10? No. Don't pay $10. Wait for a sale, or for it to appear on the Humble Bundle.",

Progression is slow; you have to methodically chip away at the walls and make sure that you've got some openings on the walls on the off chance you pass under some minerals that you cannot reach. You can expand your pack but you're still running back to the nearest teleporter every few minutes to drop off another load in the hopes that you can afford a decent upgrade.  The platforming is stiff and entirely reliant on finding certain upgrades rather than any actual skill: if you can't reach it, you're not meant to yet.

I found a teleporter, but that only works for so long until you dig down so far that it becomes a real chore and a burden getting back to it, especially since if you dug around a certain way you can't jump up but sometimes you can use a steam powered jump but if you are out of water you can't use it... what a mess. I couldn't afford another personal teleporter because I didn't have any more blue orbs and they are hard to come by, so it was back to wall-jumping my way back up to the teleporter to reach town. In fact, this could have been a much better game if there was a easier way to get back to town to sell your mined ore, but there isn't. I started falling asleep because about 90% of my time was spent wall jumping back up, way up, and the rest of my time was spent pressing the B button on the controller to hit rocks.  What a ♥♥♥♥ing borefest, 3/10",

Fortunately this didn't cost much - unlike Skyrim which cost a bundle and won't work either. All I can say is, no more steam games for me. I'm tired of poring money down a rathole.",

It almost feels like people didn't even test the game at all. Don't let yourself fooled like I did, it's really not worth your time at all.  If you want a fun Metroidvania, just play Unepic. If you want a fun rogue-like, play Spelunky. If you want a fun mining game, play Terraria (or even Minecraft)  I gave this game a chance and finished it with (almost) all achievements, but I'm not gonna recommend it to anyone, so many things are just plain bad about the game. It's boring repetitive, and the controls are not even nearly as tight as a Super Meat Boy, especially the wall-jumping, oh God the wall-jumping, did they even finish coding their game?  Thumbs up for the graphics though, I gotta admit the 2D steampunk atmosphere is very appealing visually.  + Visuals - Way too short (~4 hours for all upgrades) - Too repetitive, you'll notice that after your first 10 minutes (no joke) - Music is sincerely dull and bland - Controls are approximative at best, but the wall-jumping timing mechanics get the cake  Final note: 3/10",
