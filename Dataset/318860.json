            "review_text": "So I just finished playing through the game and thought I should write a review for it. You play as a man named Leopold confined to the Palace Malebolgia. You fight for your life battling demons who have took over the palace and now rule it.    PROS      Amazing looking game and environments.    Cool story with satisfying ending.    Spooky and is full of mystery.    Fun yet challenging boss fights.    Can have your health and attack upgraded.     CONS      There isn’t much telling you what to do or where to go. Can leave you wandering around for a while.    Combat is hard to get a hold of. But similar to the Dark Souls combat system.    Healing is based off lighting candles. Only found in doorways and sometimes there are none. You will also need to light a couple to get back to full health.    Map system is hard to use and read, yet sometimes necessary to use.    OTHER FEATURES     Other things in the game that really could be good or bad.      Confined to one weapon, your halberd.    Save system is based off finding a clock, only a few within the entire game.    Can find “shields”. Locations of them will change and sometimes are necessary for boss fights.   Overall this game was a lot of fun and made me wanting to go back and beat it. And I will probably be going back to play it again soon. But like I said, it is hard to know what you are supposed to be doing at first and it can be easy to get lost. By the end of the game you should know your way around fairly well and have a good idea of what’s going on. I’m not sure if it’s worth the base price but on sale is totally worth it. Dark Souls fans give it a try!",

You click to strike and sit back, eat a sandwich and wait for your stick to strike the monster that already killed you. If you are going to put combat in a game, make the controls work! This could have been a great game. But the controls need major work! PLEASE, PATCH IT!",

            "review_text": "Malebolgia is a simple slimmed-down game in the spirit of Dark Souls, with challenging combat, obscure story and deep references to Dante's inferno. The art style, while simple, is actually very striking and beautiful. This is complemented by the brilliant sound design, which, with the shadows and darkness of the castle, creates a genuinely spooky atmosphere. The atmosphere is the highlight of the game. You explore this castle, fighting demons and holding your torch to the shadowy halls. The combat feels clunky at first, but it's ok and actually quite fun when you get used to it. Definitely use a controller and disable invert-look when playing. The game has some minor quirks and bugs, but nothing game-breaking. For a one-man dev team, and the fact that this game only costs a couple bucks, I must say I highly recommend it for anyone who is a fan of the genre.",

            "review_text": "I didn't really have much in the way of expectations of this game. I picked it up cause it looked like it could be interesting.  I suppose I will get the positives out of the way first. I do quite like the atmosphere of the game. The odd dialogue and claustrophobic environment gives the game a almost nightmarish feeling. You end up expecting to wake up at any moment. Another plus is the artstyle itself, although it is very Lo-Fi it does manage to do something interesting with what it has. The red glowing eyes of the enemies is quite effective when you see them in the dark ahead of you.   The negatives of the game however are many and can be summarized by one phrase, a critical lack of polish.   I can see what they were trying to do with this game but the problems really do pile up. From the fact that you have to go through the tutorial every time you want to continue your game. To the insanely clunky combat and extremely basic combat. (block, hit, block, hit) along with the slightly odd control scheme.   I want to give this game more praise, it tried to do something interesting and I don’t think it is really a “bad” game. Considering most of the ♥♥♥♥ that gets pushed out onto Steam it is a shining beacon of quality. But the lack of polish and really limited combat and movement just make it hard to recommend.   If you are willing to give it some time and the benefit of the doubt then there is something to like here. Just know going in that it is a very unpolished game.",
