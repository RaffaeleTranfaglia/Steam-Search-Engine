I've played this game on an Android tablet previously.    It's a cute little arcade game where you gather muffins. Each time you gather a muffin your character changes to a different one. Each have different abilities which you can upgrade.    You unlock new levels by managing to reach a certain amount of muffins without failing on the previous level.  You unlock new characters by total amount of muffins gathered.    Depending on how many muffins you gather and enemies you kill in a level you get experience points at the end of the level. These go towards upgrading your characters or your amount of extra lives etc.    Decent game, fun for a few hours.    The art style is really lovely! SFX could be better.",

Now, I do agree that MK may need to show documentation about copyright, but this review is about the result of MK rather than everyone's little 'Controversy'.  Quite a number of maps, upgradable powers, cosmetic changes that have their own powers, and Multi-Player. The art for it is well-done and is very easy on the eyes. However, the music does get a tad annoying...  A $6 game that has achievements to track your progress. You get about 3-4 times the amount of maps than you would get in Super Crate Box as well.   SO, For the Muffin Knight vs. Super Crate Box 'war', I guess you could say that I've been spoiled by playing Muffin Knight first, but I will say I like Muffin Knight better. Muffin Knight is more 'Premium' as you get more maps, upgradable powers, and Multi-player.  If you want a better game, Muffin Knight. If you want a game for $0.00, Super Crate Box.",

Looks amazing and the music goes well with the action, really fun to play and addictive: as if gathering muffins weren't enough motivation, reaching milestones to add characters to our cast and unlocking new scenarios give you more reasons to keep jumping, firing, blasting, slashing and smashing.  Controls work great, stylish graphics and good sound effects, plus a funny idea, and great execution make this game a very good option if youâ€™re looking to just have fun. Well done Angry Mob Games!",

While I felt like there's not much to it when playing by yourself, the same game in versus or coop multiplayer is some of the most fun you can have in a simple platforming action game with two players.  TLDR: Good.",

            "review_text": "First of all: I'm not going to show mercy on this game. So if that's something you wish to avoid, then here's your warning. TL;DR: It can be a fun experience, but that's most of it. That aside, it still remains a clone and lacks any love put into it from the developers. If you can get it for really cheap, check it out. Otherwise, stick with Super Crate Box, which is free.  -----full review-----  How to describe Muffin Knight... Well, I think saying it's Super Crate Box mixed with the graphics of Ducktales Remastered might just be the most accurate thing. But for the people who have never played Super Crate Box, allow me to ellaborate. The gameplay consists of you being put into some kind of arena, in which you have to gather enough Muffins to unlock the next stage, while being cautious of enemies who are trying to ruin your progress. Muffins also unlock new weapons when you obtained a select amount of them. And that is really all there is to it. I would say it's an innovative combat system, if they didn't straight out rip it off Super Crate Box. Some of the weapons do the EXACT same effect, but just having a dual pistol being replaced with an archer. This game is more on the child-friendly tour, so it replaced all weapons and enemies with weapons or mythological creatures.  The story is very... vague. Protagonist finds a basket of Muffins and boom, he gets turned into a guy who can switch between weapons. Don't know what his goal is, but apparently he just needs to get his muffins back from some... dragonguy. NOTHING is explained in the game, except for the first part.  At first it creates the illusion of difficult. You can't touch an enemy, or you're dead. Fortunately there are upgrades for that. You really have to make decisions about what to upgrade though. At first it might look easy to level up, but it becomes more of a grindfest at later levels. That is, if we exclude the extra modes this game has.  Oh wait, did I say extra modes? Hahaha, aaah, how funny. Where do I begin...  You start of the game in Knight Mode. Once you have beaten all the stages and defeated the final boss, you unlock a mode. And after you have finished that one, you unlock another. And another. And another. Would this be a problem? Not really, if it wasn't the EXACT same, just with increased difficulty. Why, in the name of Last Order, do this? Let us choose our dificulty, don't force it on us.  And those reasons above form my biggest complaint with the game: It lacks love from the developpers. Like I said, I won't show mercy and I definitely won't here. They literally ripped off Super Crate Box, gave it a more child-friendly and HD design, and to avoid having a short game, let us repeat the game over and over again a total of 5 times. It's not even funny.  If you can get this game for really cheap, go ahead. I definitely won't stop you. When I started this game, I did have a fun time. But over time, it just decreased. If you want to try out a game like this, get Super Crate Box.  Note that I'm not trying to advertise Super Crate Box, but it's not only the same original game, but it's free too.",
