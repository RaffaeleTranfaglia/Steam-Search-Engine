I like the World Tour best so far. Lots of customization, achievements to keep things interesting. All in all a fun little diversion. A surprising thumbs up!  Edit - I have had the game crash a few times in the World Tour mode, not consistently though.  Edit 2 - I've had a few more odd bugs occur, a little annoying at times but usually clear up with a game restart. Also, some of the achievements will take a looooooonnnnng time to get; but I still find the game a good diverson, easy to play a short while and I feel like I will come back to this every so often for a round or two.",
