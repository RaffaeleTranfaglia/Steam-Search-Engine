There are elements, sure, like Detective Vision, but the game becomes a clunky sidescroller, and I do mean clunky. I played for ten horrible minutes, and I truly believe that I would have felt more in control if the game was entirely controlled by button prompts, like DDR. Maybe you're an Arkham fan, and like me, you see this game on sale for $5. Maybe you ignore the negative reviews and decide to buy it, like me. Save your money, PLEASE. If this game is on sale, odds are other games are too, and here on Steam, $5 can go a long way. I would never recommend this to anybody.",

But after playing 3.8 hours of this game, I can't bear to play it anymore. The in-game map is confusing as hell (and as far as I'm concerned completely useless) and the combat is extremely clunky. This game attempts to mimic the freeflow combat seen in the other Arkham games but it does a rather poor job of doing so thus making the combat not fun whatsoever! When playing this, it got to the point where everything felt like a chore, and when you start feeling that way about a game that's when you know it sucks.  Also, you can tell that the developers didn't put a lot of logical thought into this. For example, Batman arrives at Blackgate prison with JUST batarangs. WHY THE HELL WOULD HE NOT ARRIVE WITH ALL OF HIS GADGETS?! And to get the rest of the gadgets, you have to find them in various places in the prison. How does that make any sense story-wise? How did his gadgets get stolen and hidden in the prison? The game never explains this.   So yeah, this game sucks, and it sucks big time. Not even worth playing for hardcore Batman fans, imo. Remember the Batman Forever game for the SNES and Sega Genesis? This game is just as frustrating and lame as that one.  I bought this on sale for like $3 and I still feel ripped off. For God's sake, do not waste your money on this even if it's on sale. I'm warning you!",

            "review_text": "  I was gifted a copy of this game by Warner Brothers following the technical issues that plagued Arkham Knight's release. I probably wouldn't have played it otherwise despite loving the Arkham series and even being a fan of the often maligned Arkham Origins. This game was originally designed for handheld consoles like the 3DS and Vita and it shows - what works on those consoles doesn't necessarily work on the PC, where the combat (a mainstay of the series) feels shallow and lacks impact and the graphics - while nice - don't live up to prior games in the series.  The story is reasonable but sadly it lacks in the most important department - the thug banter. The personality and charm that this gave to other games in the series is completely lacking here, thugs barely talk and when they do they don't have much to say. To make matters worse, there is no postgame content - if you don't complete everything before the final Boss you have to start all over again. To make matters even worser, the game cuts off access to particular rewards. This means you need at least a total of three complete playthroughs if you're a completionist, and the game honestly isn't good enough to warrant another go around.  It's not bad, but it's got nothing really going for it beyond the license and the goodwill of the other games in the series. It was fine enough to play, but not anything I'd recommend going out of your way to get to. You'll probably end up more frustrated than anything else, thinking about what could have been.",

I read about the bad controls, the clunky camera. How slow this game is and feels.  But I had fallen in love with the Arkham series. And I heard it was Canon so when one day it was on sale for a few bucks I thought '♥♥♥♥ it'. I like the series so much I wanted to expeirence everything. What a Mistake I made. he Story told here is not worth ♥♥♥♥. And while it may still be canon it is just so ♥♥♥♥ing non-saying and insignificant.  I could repeat all the gameplay and control issues that many others have pointed out once again. But I really don't see the point.  And to convince you a little more. I am not a picky player by any means. I can pull myself through alot for the sake of a game or a story. I can overlook many flaws. And it happened during this game too. At the start I immediatly noticed what everyone meant here by the game's issues and it really did feel bad. But I pulled myself through and got used to it. And while it was never really fun. It was playable in the middle.  But then the endgame oh the ♥♥♥♥ing end game. Especially the Penguin Boss fight and if he is the last you defeat that's what coming after it. Frustrating, unecessary and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.  I can just repeat what many others said before me. Even if on Sale, heck even if free. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!

It gave me the nostalgia of an old school batman game I used to play way back when on the SNES.   I didn't play to far into the game at the point of writing this review but I will already say that im not disapointed with my purchase other than the fact that it was not what I thought I would be getting.   The controls are just like the batman games on console and I can see where the game can be enjoyable. All in all I would pick this game up again on sale but probably not for the full retail price.",

It makes sense that it should have a bit of a Metroid flavor since many of the people who worked on this game also worked on the Metroid Prime games. You explore Blackgate Prison trying to take down Penguin, Black Mask, and The Joker while collecting gadgets, armor upgrades, and much more. The combat is a simplified version of the system from the other Arkham games. In this game you just punch,counter, and do takedowns and it feels surprisingly good. The combination of good combat, great exploration, and excellent setting have made for a fantastic game which I've had trouble putting down. The bottom-line is if you like Batman, Metroid, or both then buy it.",

            "review_text": "It's like they took every single feature of Arkgam Origins (already the weakest game of the series) and made it even worse.  This game is a very clear demonstation of why Batman: Arkham series won't work in 2D.   First of all, the combat is very similar to the one in 3D Arkham games. But since it's in 2D, you never know what guy Batman will hit. And, of course, he always hits the one with the shoker stick or the one who can block. This makes fighting the generic enemies really frustrating.  In contrast, the bosses are too easy. I've defeated Solomon Grundy on the first try in less than a minute.  Secondly, looking for secrets and navigating levels in general is boring. Many people find the map in the game confusing, but it was pretty easy to understand for me. The real problem is the level design itself. The levels are too small. and it's like the same rooms/ventilation shafts/tunnels all over again.  Thirdly, the story is really lacking and even the Joker feels boring and dumb.  Finally, my gamepad (360 controller for windows) is switching off every 20-30 seconds when playing this game for no reason. Since it works fine in other games, I believe this has something to do with the way the game itself. And to make things even worse, the default keys when playing on mouse/keyboard are not remappable. For instance, I cannot bind 'crouch' to C because the key is bound to something else.  I really tried to love this game, but the problems with the controls were the final thing I'm giving up on this.",

It has absolutely no direction when dealing with objectives. The map is utter garbage, things that are innaccessble from certain sections of the map and you are instructed to access them that way.

            "review_text": "Let me get straight down to it: this game sucks. It is a waste of time, money, effort, and constantly frustrates you if you're an Arkham fan.   For some reason, they decided to make it so you control Batman FROM THE SIDE like some kind of Mario side-scroller game, making it IMPOSSIBLE to be stealthy as well as hiding enemies from your line of sight while you're traveling so that they can jump you.   Not only that, but the 'cutscenes' are just lame little comic book pictures with a moving hand here or a cigarette with smoke that moves there. It makes you feel completely disconnected from the story as every other moment is interrupted by one of these so-called 'cutscenes.' As if not feeling like Batman could be in danger wasn't already disconnected!   One of my biggest beefs was the first boss fight. It threw you in there with a comic book cutscene, then said, 'Have at it!' without giving you ANY advice whatsoever, expecting you to KNOW how to beat him - with your 5 basic moves... It took me a few tries on NORMAL to figure out what to do, each time having to wait 10 seconds to skip the annoying cutscene.    Another beef I have is that the game STARTS with a cutscene - so you KNOW it's probably going to be a bad game. After the intro cutscene, you jump right in to a fight with some security guards as Catwoman escapes from her most recent burglary.    Then, you have to follow her around - which is quite difficult given the 2D atmosphere yet making you make choices as if it were 3D (grappling onto something in the background, for instance). You finally capture her and send her to Blackgate, which then gets taken over by the Joker, Black Mask, and Penguin. So you go there and work out a deal to team up with her (though you never play as her or see her except in the comic cutscenes), and start beating stuff up.   In fact, that's all this game is. You follow the yellow-brick road since you're practically NAILED to it - no free movement whatsoever - and beat up stuff along the way in a weird attempt at the Super Mario Bros. meets Prison Break.   Now, I know I sound really harsh, but trust me - I'm practically UNDER-exaggerating the crud this game hands to you. I even gave it the benefit of the doubt - I truly hoped it would get better - and gave it about an hour's try. Now I wish I had that hour back, along with my $20 and 2 GB of Hard Drive Disc space. Yeah, it's only 2 GB (other Arkham games range in the late 20's). That can give you an idea about how much - or should I say, how little - the content is in this game.

While the level design is fairly well done and the game does a good job of providing Metroidvania-esque exploration, it fails in almost every other way. First off, while the level design is good, the navigation is a pain. The 'world' is split into three maps, which you have to enter/exit from the front door/back door, which are not easily accessible from most of the map, causing a large portion of backtracking to be for the sole purpose of leaving your current area. To complicate things further, the map is very poorly displayed, particularly in regards to areas with multiple height levels, which can make finding your way around extremely obnoxious.  The freeflow combat from the previous games is forced into the 2D perspective, which makes targeting enemies impossible, (you can only attack people directly in front or behind you) and often times they will strafe into the foreground or background which makes it difficult, sometimes literally impossible, to hit them. The predator aspect has almost been entirely removed for this game, and when it does show up, performs terribly, as without the three dimensional movement, there is no way to hide or sneak about other than running away.  In addition, blocks/counters don't seem to register half the time and there are no rebindable controls, with the default controls being incredibly odd, making controlling an issue on top of the gameplay issues. In regards to plot, it is extremely simple and is told in such a simple way that you'll get the same level of investment in the game from reading a paragraph long summary of the plot on Wikipedia. In short, I highly recommend that even avid Batman fans avoid this game, as you'll only be disappointed at best, absolutely infuriated at worst.",

Unfortunatly you will get lost alot if you don't take a good look at the map because this game is a freaking maze and the map isn't that well ordered. And you have to backtrack a lot. The story is cool but the graphics outdated. Oh and just a warning this is nothing like the other Arkham games this is the adventure genre.",

            "review_text": "Pretty good!  The good: - Solid sound and voice work makes it feel like an Arkham game. - Graphics are light compared to Arkham Origins but are plenty good enough in motion. - Joker's boss fight. Solidly paced and you have multiple options based on what gadgets you have at the time. - By extension, the game is kinda a Metroidvania  but  you can tackle the three sections of the game (and their bosses) in whatever order you choose. This makes less sense story-wise but is nice from a gameplay standpoint. - The hacking minigame is better than any of the ones from Arkham Asylum, City, or Origins. It actually makes you do something instead of just holding two buttons/rotating sticks.  - Any goon with a gun is dangerous (Unless you're wearing the unlockable  Darkest Knight  Batsuit).  The not so good and bad: - Detective case clues are just a few pixels large when playing at 1080p and are not highlighted or shown on the map until you manually scan them. This makes completing the finding all the clues tedious and frustrating. Don't feel bad about using a guide here. - Combat is ok unless there's a knife goon or stun-stick goon as you can't seem to counter-dodge their attacks unless you're facing them. Countering regular attacks sometimes misses or acts strange. - Penguin boss fight. Just... confusing the first time through and annoying later times. - Mouse control feels off. I recommend playing with a gamepad or just the keyboard controls.   So as long as you don't go into this expecting a mainline Arkham game, there's fun to be had in here.",

The mechanics are, for the most part, well translated into a 2D plane, and the exploration is quite similar. The combat IS a little stilted and not quite fluid as in its big brothers, but it definitely works and is fun (Though sliding is rather missed for some quick knockdowns). The only cons are the little 'animated' snippets...and lots..LOTS of bactracking, but the story seems cool (Nice to see the beginnings of Bats' and Catwoman's relationship) and the Arkham essence is all very much there! I don't know if i'd buy this full price, but i got it on sale, and it was WELL worth the 5 bucks! A nice weekend hobby and a cool way to keep experiencing the Arkham world (Now that i've finshed all 4 main games). BE THE (slightly smaller) BATMAN!",

            "review_text": "Honestly, this game is really frustrating to play. The controls are largely unresponsive (I use a Microsoft Wired Xbox 360 Pad) and so you can be pressing the counter button with it not doing anything, and the mechanics of the game are very frustrating at times. The Map is a 3D mess that is over-complicated for the game. There are times when you literally have no idea where you are or how you got there. The Boss fights are either ridiculously easy or overly hard and the fact that the game ues check points is very frustrating on the bosses. You can beat the same bosses first couple of phases over and over again, but if you die then you have to redo the entire fight from the start (including any cut scenes) which just gets overly frustrating (particularly on the Penguin boss fight because his gaurds can seem to see you even when they have their back to you).   The controls are a mess too, and so sometimes you need to hold 'A' to enter a vent, sometimes its Down + 'A', sometimes the Right Trigger button or sometimes its Down + Right Trigger. When you are trying to escape an enemy with a gun, you can be pressing the buttons you usually press to get away, but this particular room might have a completely differnt set of buttons. It really is just a mess.   The combat is repetitive and boring too. You can start a combo on an enemy and rather than seeing different attacks, Batman just throws the same punch over and over again until the final blow (which does differ). It just feels really lacking compared the real Arkham Games.   Another thing which is overdone and frustrating is the constant back tracking. You need to enter each wing to get a piece of Bat-Tech for the next wings Puzzle, but then have to re-enter them to get the access codes and then re-enter each one again to fight the bosses. Finally you have to re-enter them yet again because you have to disarm some Bombs which have been placed right in the dead centre of each zone. In all honesty, this game would probably last an hour if you didn't have to back track so much. It's pretty clear to me that they have just added the back-tracking in to ensure the game has a longer play time, but for me it wasn't fun, it was very boring and very frustrating getting lost constantly.   I have loved all of the Arkham games and DLC and even though this was a side scroller beat em up, I wanted to love it too but I just can't. I honestly have more fun playing an old 80's side scroller like Streets of Rage or Final Fight than I had during the several hours this took to complete.   I feel bad leaving this review if I am honest, but I just can't say anything nice about this game. Even the story itself is pretty bland and doesn't make much sense. I wanted to play it because I had heard it bridged the gap between Arkham origins and Arkham Asylum, but to be truthful I could have easily never played this and still felt like the games bridged by themselves. The story just doesn't link the games for me, and it made the overall frustration factor even worse because I might as well have not wasted my time.   I honestly wouldn't recommend buying this game. If you get it free from a Bundle of the other Arkham games, then sure give it a play. But honestly, I regret buying this game.",

I mean, it is clunkier than a GDI Juggernaut being attacked from all directions. And don't even get me started on the graphics. It looks like something out of a game made in 2008. Now now, I know graphics is not everything, but this is something I cannot overlook if the game bears a title such as this. I'll admit, I'm being biased because I'm used to the controls and combat mechanics of other Arkham games; but I just simply cannot recommend this game unless it is on sale or, hell, even free (lel I got it free). But, I personally feel that it really isn't worth it for the title. It doesn't even remotely feel like an Arkham game. ",
