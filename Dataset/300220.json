EVERYONE insults you for being a schmuck. And taunts you about it.  The combat is not just subpar, it is abominable.  You do not get access to magic. All you get is physical attacks (you do eventually get a non-magical healer) There is never a sense of just barely able to beat a fight - you either trounce them breezily, or you get crushed.  The only way to win is to not play.",

Pros: + Interesting story + Fairly fleshed out characters + No unobtainable achievements (for a single playthrough) + The ending - compared to the rest of the game  Cons: - Grinding kind of required (money is a really scarce luxury in the game) - Can be ruthless at the start (kind of alleviated if you manage to save up for the Knight Sword on one of your party members) - No quest journal (something like an item in the inventory per quest just to remind us of a quest in progress would be awesome)  Summary: Get it for the story, not the gameplay.",

        {
            "review_text": "I must say: This game didn't have a very strong first impression, but I did perservere and made it to the end.  One big lasting note throughout the length of this game (which taking it generally at a medium pace took me less than six hours, which, is downright laughable for an RPG) is that most of the assets seemed to be taken from RPG Maker. Almost no custom work, but I guess that could be excused if the game had a strong story and RPG assets. Does it?  Ehhhh no, not at all... and I'll just break it down.  - THE STORY - The story was probably the only thing that made me gather any remote interest in this game. Pretty much the story is about a (knight?) guy named William who basically gets to be in a game of body-juggling. On his mission to rid an imp in some elderly guy's basement he gets in the way of Xen, the witch in the kingdom of Opress. She gets annoyed of his friend and for some reason Xen zaps both of them (I honestly have no idea why, Will didn't taunt Xen in any way) changing Xen into a girl. The meat of the story is thrown in your face throughout the first half of the game: You are a girl and you want to be changed back. There's an underlying story of the war that should be stopped but honestly it's put in the background until the last hour of the game.  I don't recall playing RPGs where being a girl generates so much negative attention like in this game though. There are a good percent of people in the game that seem to just make sexist jokes towards you. Either way, most of the storyline is pretty cliche, and I honestly forgot most of it even after playing it. I honestly don't even remember most of your followers' names since they don't really garner any interest. There are people who seem to just get in your way for no reason and some of the plots actually never conclude (like the plot between William and his mother).  - THE COMBAT - The combat is pretty bad... just laying that out there. I feel like the combat was just taked on for more length because in a game as short as this one, getting to level 10 is an achievement. Most of your partners share the same attacks so there's no variety. Swords are really the only useful weapons (because the five strongest weapons are SWORDS), and if you get the best piece of armour (for only 500 gold), you win.  Oh, and should I mention getting those best swords is so easy it's laughable? You can easily wipe through all the combat with one (I assume) missight if you go to the port town at the BEGINNING of the game, go to the wood shop, do the job there countlessly, and earn infinite gold. To put it clearly, I spent an hour doing the job, and earned enough to give my party the best armour and weapons AN HOUR into the game. This made all the combat pretty much pointless. It's bland enough anyway that I just kept hitting enter throughout most of the game and only lost like two battles.  One thing though, is you should get good weapons before going off to Unitem (or whatever it's called) because when you get to Oasis, you either need a lot of gold or strong weapons to defeat a boss on the island. I made the mistake of only getting armour to that point on the first playthrough and I was essentially stuck because there was no way to get better weapons and no way to earn gold. Had to start the game over.  Now, I know the majority of this review was negative, but it's honestly hard for me to remember any good points of the game. One good point I guess is that there's a lot of side quests (but they're almost all fetch quests that give you gold) and the dialogue is somewhat passible. Either way, I can list more flaws but I'd just rather play a better game in this genre because it's obviously taking roots from other, much better JRPGs like Final Fantasy or the Zeboyd games.  OVERALL RATING: 3/10  (If there's anything that I missed, feel free to notify me in any way. Keep in note that I write these reviews immediately after finishing the game.)",
