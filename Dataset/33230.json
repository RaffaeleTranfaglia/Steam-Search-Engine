Free Roam Open World A story of a child who grows up to be an assassin How it has such amazing character designs The graphic was good when the game first came out. but now you compare to other creed games, it's not that great. but it's still an enjoyable game. The game has many weapons and armors to buy.  Maybe some parts of the game are repeative, eg looting, same combat, but you learn more combats as you pogress through the story, but it's still enjoyable until you finish the game.  It's one of the best assassin's creed game created, i don't care if you think i'm wrong or not this is my own review and opinion. The game is set in italy and you get to travel almost the major city of italy. You can pickpocket!!  But i know this doesn't says much about the game, it's just what i'v experienced playing over maybe 1000+ hours on the 360, it's one of the best assassin's creed game! and i recommend it to everyone who loves free roam, open world with amazing set in old days countryside, city and it has such amazing music aswell!",

            "review_text": "I know there were a great many complaints about the first Assassin's Creed game, and they're mostly well warranted. I, however, had a great experience with the game. The wonder of playing an open world game set in an historical era was such a mind-blowing experience that I found it easy to look past the repetition, the janky climbing mechanics, and the various other problems the game shipped with. Honestly, new IPs as ambitious as the first Assassin's Creed game deserve a little leeway anyhow, since they're attempting to accomplish so much while starting from scratch. Nevertheless, the game was severely flawed, and it rightfully got some flak for it.  Assassin's Creed II, when it released, was a perfect example of why the medium of video games is filled with successful sequels. It's difficult for a studio to nail everything in their first try when, many times, they're starting from the ground up by building things like graphics and physics engines from scratch. So much time focused on the building blocks of a game leaves little time to flesh out the more dynamic aspects on top of those, which is why the first game featured so much reptition. Assassin's Creed II, however, improves upon everything that the first game promised. The graphics were superb at the time they released. There were literally no other open world games that looked this good, and they even stand up pretty well today. The cities were beautiful, they were alive. Florence is not a city that's changed much, and they completely nailed the feel of what I imagine it would be like at the turn of the 15th century. Platforming is improved, it's quicker, and it's more intuitive, but it's unfortunately not fully polished in this effort. When it works, it's improved massively over the previous game. The campaign itself is a meaty, lengthy game that's packed with content. You're visiting multiple cities here, you're visiting the beautiful Tuscan countryside, and the game is spanning decades. As somebody who's visited most of the areas depicted in this game, I can confidently say they've nailed the feel of the entire region. Ezio as a character is interesting, he's charismatic. He's an easy guy to root for, and his story begins personally and eventually emerges into a grand scale. He's been dealt a raw deal, but he lets things slide in a way that feels simultaneously incredible and admirable. Combat and player management has been expanded upon from the first game as well, as armor management, weapon and gadget management, and new costumes are all greatly designed. Customizing your Ezio is one of the most satisfying parts of the game. Combat is built upon from the first game, and now feels far more in depth. Probably the single best mechanic in the game is the build-your-own-stronghold aspect with Ezio's family villa. It's very addictive, and the visual change you experience in the small city is one that's immensely satisfying. As you invest money in building up your walled city, the population increases, the streets are cleaner and brighter, and the city is louder and more bustling as a result. I didn't realize quite how much it changed until I began a new game and saw how murky and depressing the place was when you first arrive there.  One specific thing I'd like to highlight here and really stress is just how good the soundtrack of this game is. It's been mentioned before but I haven't seen anybody truly do it justice, yet. Jesper Kyd absolutely kills it, and sets the bar so highly here that he can't hit the same heights of quality in AC: Brotherhood or AC: Revelations. The music all fits the settings so superbly that I really can't imagine playing this game without it. Half of the reason the world is so immersive is the setting, the ambient nose, the lighting, and the architecture. The other half is all soundtrack. No exaggeration. The music is all ambient, and very low-key, but it flows like a satin ribbon, enveloping your brain and keeping you floating through the streets like you're walking on air. It's just so effective at immersing you into Ezio's world. It breathes life into an already beautiful world, and Kyd's dismissal as the series composer is a big part of the reason why Assassin's Creed III seems dead and less alive to me. The Florence theme in particular is utterly spectacular.  This game, though, is certainly not without its flaws. Free running control has aged poorly since 2009 and can be frustrating at times, especially when attempting to move quickly. This makes any races and chase sequences an annoyance at best, and downright infuriating at worst. Ezio simply doesn't always go where you want him to, and story mission chase sequences are often purely trial and error as a result. Most frustrating would have to be Ezio's tendency to inexplicably stop when scaling straight up a building, and look the left at nothing in particular. This happening during a chase is especially frustrating. At times the camera is a massive pain during combat sequences, getting stuck behind buildings and spires. I also had an issue with the lack of a quick checkpoint restart option and fewer and further between checkpoints. It makes the light stealth gameplay here a frustrating experience at times.  To put it with as much brevity as possible: This game is an experience. It's a thoroughly atmospheric, immersive delight that will transport you straight into this time period and make you want to do nothing but walk the streets of Florence and pole through the canals of Venice for hours on end, with no goal in mind more than collecting a few treasure boxes, seeing the sights, and listening to Jesper Kyd's wonderful score. I love this game.",

I've personally never failed to connect to Uplay either in this or any other Ubisoft game, but I know some people have problems.  One other thing: I definitely recommend playing with a controller because of the wacky keyboard controls; however, there are two files you have to download and paste into the game to get it to work correctly.  Other than those two potential issues, neither of which bothered me, it's an absolutely great game, right up there with Black Flag, maybe even better. There aren't nearly as many of Black Flag's infamous tail quests (which I wasn't particularly good at). Anyway, grab it on sale.",

The fact that you can live Ezio's life, by making money, speaking with family members, using different character types to assist you in missions, means you become more invested in the game. If I had one gripe about a certain character type it would be that the courtesans automatically leave you to 'distract' gaurds when they're near one, even if you didn't want them to and you were only passing by. I find thieves to be the most effective distraction personally, even if they do accidentally die falling off rooftops a lot.",

It also lead to such apparent popularity that Ubisoft decided to flog the series into oblivion thereafter with yearly sequels including 2 spin-offs to Ezio's particular story (which where still decent if formulaic).  The inclusion of multiplayer as well as an on-the-go manual and historical checkbook, and puzzle minigames made the game enjoyable not only by increasing the rich wealth of historical lore but adding much needed breaks from running over rooftops, causing tiles to crash to the streets below...   This and Brotherhood (it's first sequel and second part of Ezio's trilogy) are the best of the Assassin's Creed series, partly because the game was still fresh and partly because the setting of Renaissance Italy was one of the most fascinating areas of history to explore.

AC2 also still suffered from the control issues from the first game with Ezio randomly jumping off of or getting stuck on various things while climbing or doing parkour. While these created some frustration they didn't take away from the overall game.  If you are new to the AC franchise, I would recommend starting with AC2. Altair wasn't that great of a character and the gameplay of the first game was repetitive and boring. AC really begins to be its own unique game in AC2 and you start with a long, expansive story with Ezio spanning 3 games.

I began with Asssassin's Creed 2 because before buying I toke a look at the forum of the game, and saw several reviews about Assassin's Creed '1', and several people say the game is very good but with a lot of repeatitivy missions, and can be boring after some hours of gameplay. In the other side, I read good reviews about AC2, then I did a option to take Assassin's Creed 2, Brotherhood and Revelations, and with it get a game and two after with the same protagonist, Ezio. I bought the games during a steam sale, and thought good to take 3 games at same time with a good price. At this time when I write this review, I have finished AC2 and started Brotherhood yesterday.  Well, it's an amazing game with amazing story, I really like the game and sure recommend it. Pros: * Amazing story, based on Italy near 1490, 1500.  * Some historical persons like Leonardo da Vinci, Machiavel, and others. * Good mechanical of fights, with a variety of weapons, swords, and the hidden blade \\m/ * Good side missions, some timely chalenged, some stealth. I didn't get bored with them. * Several hours of gameplay. * The evolve of habilities in fight and parkour during the game.  Cons: * The 3rd person view sometimes sucks. Sometimes the camera changes, you didn't view the back of your person, view by the side, the controls change too. Sometimes it sucks a lot to do right directional jumps, and sometimes when a jump is wrong you need to return and restart the mission from the beginning, very anoying. Fortunatelly this type of problems begin when you are at +-80% of the game. * Because last explained, some missions is a pain in the ♥♥♥ to finish. Imagine like you play for 5 or 6 hours just to finish a mission with 5 minutes of duration. And when you go youtube for help, you see other players saying the same: some anoying missions are really very, very anoying. * The mechanism of stealth in this game seems some broke. I had played Far Cry 3 some time before, I really like stealth way of play, and in Far Cry 3 the AI and stealth works very better. * The way the game shows controls during the game: the game don't show the keys (like E, shift, button 2, space), and instead shows icons related to the actions. Not a big problem, but take some time playing to fixing in mind these associations. I noticed it is better on Brotherhood that shows the keys instead of icons. A tip: I swap right mouse button with shift key, I think is better to run by holding the shift key (like in Battlefield, Call of Duty and other games) instead of holding mouse button. * Uplay DRM. It's not really a cons for me, fortunatelly I didn't get problem with uplay, but several people don't like uplay.",

            "review_text": "Considering this game is quite a few years old now, I'm probably looking at this from a different perspective than most. But in Summary, it's a good, almost great port for PC.  First the Good: This game's graphics have aged pretty well. Not totally, but enough where it ever bothered me. I understand the time it came from, so just have an open mind if you've never played this game before. It's more colorful than the first game. Textures and models still look good. Character models are a little dated but not too bad.  There is plenty of content, most of which is compelling and/or fun enough to actually bother with. You can do anything from races to assassination contracts to collecting feathers to even flying with Da Vinci's invention just for fun. You can look for hidden loot, do the assassin's tomb side quests (which are great fun and grant you Altair's armor after you do all six), to courier missions, to taking down thieves and runners.   The main story is very interesting, and you start out, once you're in the Animus, as Ezio as a baby, so you practically see Ezio's entire life unfold. The story is more character driven than paying attention to the big picture, which really isn't at the forefront until almost near the end of the game. You'll go to many different historic locations in Italy as the story unfolds.   The game difficulty is relatively easy, so it's accessible to new Gamers. It never felt overly easy where I felt bored, though, and by the end of the game it brought on a decent challenge, as it brings about everything you've learned and gained to full circle. The AI is also decently balanced and well programmed with some exceptions, as when in need to be stealthy, they won't unfairly spot you... most of the time.   Now the Bad: The controller input was a huge pain to set up. It's weird really, it recognized that I was using an XBox One controller (literally, it didn't think it was a 360 controller) but inputs are read as 'Button 1, Button 2, etc.' So they were a pain to set and often I had to go back and change them because they still felt uncomfortable. The controls in the HUD are also not identified as 'A, B, X, Y, etc.' instead they are identified as symbols, which gets very confusing until you use them after a few hours and commit them to memory.   On top of that, the camera can screw up a jump incredibly easily, or if Ezio isn't positioned right at times he'll jump in the complete opposite direction you wanted him too and either die, get found, or lose a lot of health. This got annoying but not to the point where I wanted to stop playing.  Also... Uplay. This is a negative because of how weird it acts. A few times Uplay crashed on me, sometimes it wouldn't start up the game, other times it actually froze my computer. Also it's mandatory to have it run to play this game.   Now the (not so) bad: This is almost like a feature (The series as a whole is known for their glitches), but there are glitches galore, but never to the point of game breaking and usually they end up being really funny. The AI will push each other, sometimes dead bodies spaz out, at one point my target accidentally killed itself, etc. Sometimes it ended up costing me, like there is some collision detection issues when assassinating guards on the edge of a roof, but sometimes I would end up having them stuck in the wall with their legs hanging out, so I got a good laugh from that.   All in All I highly recommend this if you missed out, as you're in for a real treat. Returning players who lost/sold their console versions can have this as a good alternative if they have a moderately decent computer, even if they may have trouble setting up the controls on a gamepad.",

And Ubisoft really learned the lesson about the second one. Each city is huge, very huge, with hundreds of side-missions, places to explore, objects to search and collect, a village to improve and much more. The plot gives a turn, showing for the first time was is really going on, and mixing science fiction with a touch of fantasy. And the multiple plot details, based makes the story much more credible. The visual aspect, even when is quite remarkable, is not what really stands out, but the absurdly amazing art and design. Again, each corner of the renaissance Italy is detailed, rich, full of life. One thing is disliked is that the game feels stretched, and when you think is going to be over soon, still has at least 3 hours of plot related gameplay. With only that 'flaw' aside, the second title of the Assassin's saga is a game that I won't stop recommending.",

Graphics: The Graphics are very good for a 5 year old game a few glitchy textures here and there but thats about all especilly if you have a pc that use max settings it can look really nice.  Story: I loved the story being the second in the trillogy I didnt know how it would compair to the first game, which I wasnt a fan of, but in my opinion it's far better than the first game. The actual story I loved easly 30 hours of gamplay and I allways wanted to play on to see what would happen next.  Extras: Admitedly the side extrtas allthough fun to start off with get a bit tireing towords the end as it's pretty much just the samethings a bit of varity the more you play through the game but mostly the same things.  Map: One of my favorite things to do in this game was just climeing over roofs trying to stelthily take out the guards It was great fun. Plus you dont have to put up with the same map for long as the game quickly moves along to new areas where the land scape is diffrent to an extent.  Controlls: The controlls for this (on a keyboard) are relitivly easy the grasp the parkour elament of it is rather simple may take a bit of getting used to but not that hard. The combat is where I had some difficulties basic returns and blocks are easy to manage but some of the mroe advanced moves are acward to do apart from that it is a pretty smooth controlls  All said I do still love this game by far a great collection to the series and I recomend it to anyone who likes the stelthy approuch to things 9/10 (apologys for any incorrect spelling I'm dyslexic so bound to have some incorrect spelling in there I try not to have too many but some slip past me)",

This is also a great entry to the story of the series if you don't feel like playing through the first one. (this game is far superior to the original in pretty much every way.)  I've owned this game for some years now and it was basically one of those games that were part of my backlog of games, most of which will never get played despite my intention to play them all. I'm sooo glad that I decided to play this game over some others in that backlog of mine. The game still is visually pleasing, not yet too 'retro' feeling (This review written in 2015). I was still in awe of many of the visuals. More importantly though, this game has great gameplay, a great story, great characters, great acting and animation. This is the real deal, a gamer's game. Stuffed so full of content, I didn't even do all the extra missions (not even close) and I spent 30 hours in this game enjoying every second. I really can't recommend the game enough. It starts slow and you might be bored for the first bit but trust me when I say that it gets GOOD and fairly quickly. I am now starting to play the next game in the series, Brotherhood, which picks up right where this left off in a very epic way. Make sure you sit at the start screen in these games for a minute or two before pressing start/enter to watch the opening cinematic.

Cities look great. - When it works, the acrobatic action is really fun. - There is enough stuff to do.  The bad: - It is not open-ended when this kind of game clearly should be - You cannot replay an earlier part of the game. There is only one savegame!!! - Some of the acting is kind of lame, though most of it was ok. - Some faces look/animate pretty badly - It often forces the main storyline down your throat and won't let you get to the cool stuff if you don't go with it. Again, the game feels like it should be sandboxy and open-ended but it isn't really. - You are forced to install and use Uplay from Ubisoft to play the game. Uplay will glitch out and not let you play or mess up your savegame and is just generally annoying and forced and I will make a consious attempt not to use it anymore.  - Obviously this is not entirely the game's fault but, for such a famous game, I am surprised to see almost no mods for it. Again, the surprise is in the fact that sandbox-type games like this one usually have good modding support. - When the parkour acrobatics system fails, it looks quite clumsy and annoying. The player has little control over the process as it simply involves holding 3 buttons together, so you can't get much better at it except by trying to turn your character better. - The controls and interface clearly show that it's a console port.

Whereas Assassin's Creed 1 introduced us to the idea of Templars vs Assassins; here it is fleshed out further with conspiracies and intrigue. Assassin's Creed 2 is also an interesting dive into historical Italy during the Renaissance. Very few games have pulled off a fully involved historical drama with attention to detail that this one does.  I fully enjoyed Ezio's origin story and his journey of self-discovery. He is literally Renassiance Batman with a very similar revenge plot, but at the same time the plot twists and turns keep the ideas fresh and interesting.  While graphically dated by today's standards, AC2 still stands the test of time. Combat mechanics are still very fluid and easy to pick up and play.

            "review_text": "The AC series is pretty much a 'must' for gamers into RPG. The gameplay videos on Youtube look amazing and the game comes with a fair prize during Steam's campaign sales. AC2 and AC:B are available on OS X as well so there was no second thought about purchasing it.   But it doesn't all smell of roses.   When you buy the game, they don't tell you that you can't play it before a forceful subscription into Uplay which seems to be some kind of Ubisoft's own gaming platform/environment thing. And if this does not feel enough like Big Brother breathing down your neck, then check this out: you have to agree to some freakin' long legal document before they let you play. Now, what if I didn't want to agree to it? Would I get a reimburse? I won't answer that. Basically Ubisoft kicks in some extra demands AFTER you've paid them.   The game starts off pretty awesome and you get the feeling of a great story unfolding but once the intro videos end and you receive control you'll get exposed to a really complicated set of controls. I found myself spending more time in options page during the first hours of gameplay than in-game. Overall I felt very stuck and it was not fun at all. AC discards many 101's of gameplay controls for a reason unclear. It would not even be a problem if the game would give you time to get accommodated with it's specifications, but instead the game starts off with a competition where you have to put those newly learned combos into full use in a tight race over rooftops. It took me full 30+ times to complete it and there was nothing fun about it.  BEWARE! As if this was not enough, PC and Mac users have another major obstacle to deal with. After 30 minutes of gameplay it's quite likely that your keyboard or mouse stop working. There's especially high risk that the game starts to conflict if you're using Logitech hardware. If you don't believe me, google something like 'Assassin's Creed 2 keyboard not working' and you'll see that there are whole forums full of guys in trouble with this problem. Ubisoft's own homepage has a topic on this with no suggestions or help from their side. Don't expect any solution or help if you face this problem, you're on your own. I exchanged my Logitech mouse to a Microsoft one and now I can play for about 15 minutes, after that the mouse freezes and I have the option of either to continue playing with Mac's touchpad or restart the game. I have given up any hope to receive better performance out of the game.  The game is very mission-based and there's not as much freedom as you would expect if you saw the gameplay videos. I constantly have the feeling that if I only play a little more, it will all become more relaxed and free but I know it's an illusion. It's nothing like Elder Scrolls or Gothic.   Big brother Ubisoft really screwed me with this purchase. It's been a very bad experience for me and I know to keep away from Ubisoft products in the future for sure.",

            "review_text": "Personal Rating: 'Worth playing' Traditional Rating: 8/10 Genre: 3rd Person Action/Adventure  ***This review does contain potential spoilers so please don't continue reading this until you have played the actual game***  When the first Assassin's Creed ended our modern day test subject Desmond Miles, a man with a powerful ancestral assassin's heritage, was still being held hostage by a corporation known as Abstergo Industries. It was during these modern day sequences that we were introduced to Dr. Warren Vidic, who heads up the program where the memories of ones ancestors are accessed through a device known as the Animus. It is here that Desmond Miles was forced to experience his ancestors memories from the time of the Third Crusade - An assassin known as Altair who would break the three tenants of his Assassin's code of conduct in pursuit of the Templar, Robert de Sable, who was said to be after a powerful artifact known as the Piece of Eden. Killing de Sable would reveal that the very man at the head of the Assassin's Brotherhood was a Templar himself and one who was already in possession of this powerful artifact. Confronting and finally killing his leader, the artifact would later reveal a holographic map showing Altair/Desmond where the other artifacts were hidden throughout the world, artifacts so powerful they could change the very destiny of man. Artifacts that Abstergo would kill to get their hands on. It would also be revealed that a former test subject had been leaving cryptic messages only Desmond could decode that would foretell the end of the world.  Assassin's Creed II wastes no time in picking up where the first left off. Having discovered that Dr. Vidics assistant Lucy Stillman is a mole, she eventually breaks Desmond out of Abstergo and ferries him off to a safe house where a group of her colleagues have developed an improved Animus. Desmond must once again enter the Animus and access his ancestral memories in the hope that more pieces of the artifact will be revealed before Abstergo can learn of them. This time around we are witness to late fifteenth century Florence as we are introduced to a young nobleman by the name of Ezio Auditore da Firenz who after witnessing the death of his father and brother - brought about by a corrupt official working for the Templar's - is then forced to flee to his Uncles villa with his life and that of his mother and sister hanging in the balance. It is here that Ezio is taught the ways of the Assassin's Creed by his uncle who eventually sets him on a course of revenge that includes killing a number of Templar figureheads all involved in the death of his father and brother with the trail finally leading all the way up to the top of the Vatican itself with Rodrigo Borges - otherwise known as Pope Alexander VI - a powerful man who will stop at nothing to get his hands on the remaining pieces of the artifact. Before doing away with Rodrigo, Ezio is inducted into a secret brotherhood of assassin's having amply proven his worth to the cause.  Historically recreating locations such as Venice, Tuscany and Florence the player is introduced to this wonderfully created digital world through main missions and side missions (Rocksteady could take a leaf out of Ubisoft Montreals book on how to create a living and breathing digital world that is a pleasure to explore and not a bore). The world we get to inhabit as our playground is a wonderful recreation of late fifteenth century Italy even going as far as introducing us to a lovable Leonardo Da Vinci who Ezio befriends early in the game and who exists to help decipher the many numerous codex's Ezio comes into contact with. Spanning a period of twenty years the game is a particularly massive one and to be honest this sometimes acts to the detriment of the actual game itself. Assassin's Creed II requires a lot of dedication and patience from its players to progress through and to be honest it starts to suffer near the end because of it. Whilst most certainly a massive improvement over the original in terms of scope, design and story telling it does come at a cost where the game gets so wrapped up in its own awesomeness that it starts to make itself rather redundant, sluggish and dare I say - boring - towards the end with missions that simply exist to pad out an already lengthy game. Just as you think the story is starting to wind down to its conclusion the game will throw another mammoth task your way that will lead into another mammoth task and this may try a very few many gamers patience and tolerance levels as it did mine. Having to find out that I needed to kill nine Lieutenants of the Templar Order towards the end of the game made me want to curse to the heavens after already inhabiting this world for a good 60+ hours. For all the frustration the game induces near its end, it's carried forward by a serpentine plot that is less over the top than the original but far more thrilling and engaging. The ending is a little bit of a disappointment when you finally have Rodrigo Borgias in your assassin's sights. After all the build up this encounter is rather dull and lifeless but thankfully is concluded by a spectacular sequence I will not reveal for those that have yet to complete the adventure.  Spending so much time in the shoes of Ezio what ultimately emerges is a gaming protagonist for the ages. Voiced impeccably by a first rate cast, Ezio is immediately likable and enduring and emerges as a fully rounded and developed character that one becomes incredibly vested in early on in the game. I can see why Ubisoft was a little reluctant to pack him away after the adventure concluded going as far as creating two fully fledged sequels continuing his adventures alone. Where as Altair was a one dimensional figure from the past and not particularly likable it's the exact opposite when it comes to Ezio who can be ruthless and cunning but also generous and incredibly warmhearted. Assassin's Creed II when looked at holistically is an impressive game indeed with the graphics looking quite spectacular for the most part although you can see the games original console limitations with muddy textures abound everywhere. Audio, however, from the clash of swords to the sweeping and epic soundtrack through to the incredible voice cast is all top notch throughout the entire game. Ultimately, Assassin's Creed II emerges as a game I loved for the most part where it not for all its irritating inconsistencies towards the end (those final missions were a test of endurance and patience and frankly I could have done without them as it employs one of my pet hates in gaming where more and more enemies are thrown at the player to try and give the illusion of a suddenly ramped up difficulty). This ended up being a slight killjoy rather than the thrill ride I was expecting for a conclusion.  But with that being said I still thoroughly enjoyed the majority of my time spent in Ezio's company and I look forward to continuing my adventures with him in the future, just hoping and praying slightly that his remaining two adventures are a much tighter affair than his first one.",

            "review_text": "Assassin’s Creed II is what the original Assassin’s Creed should have been. With the inner workings of an engine already in place and two years to work with, the developers were able to produce a game that proves the potential of the series. AC2 successfully builds on the formula that was established in the first game and manages to improve upon what worked and fix most of what didn’t. The story picks up where the original left off, with Desmond Miles (and some new allies) on the run from the Templars. But this time he’s going back into the Animus willingly to re-live the memories of another ancestor, an Assassin named Ezio Auditore, in order to brush up on the Assassin skills that he’ll need for the battle ahead. Ezio’s story takes place in 15th century Renaissance Italy, primarily in the cities of Florence, Forli, and Venice.   The environments are, as usual, the most interesting element in the game. The sheer scope of the cities and all of the activity going on within is amazing. Just exploring the city, climbing buildings, etc is pretty fun in and of itself, but what you actually get to do in those cities is what elevates AC2 so far above its predecessor. The missions are no longer a series of boring identical tasks cranked out of some tedium factory. Instead, there is a huge variety of mission types and new game mechanics to go along with them. You now have the ability to blend into crowds at will, hire groups to assist you, and much more. Another welcome change is the addition of a “notoriety” system, where you gain notoriety by performing suspicious or illegal actions. Guards will typically only attack you on sight if your notoriety is high or if they see you doing something illegal. This is a huge and most welcome change from the first game, where you’d end up being attacked for the most ridiculous of things (you know... atrocities such as walking too fast). Combat is also improved from the first game. Although it’s still ultimately really easy, it remains fun due to the sheer variety of things you can do (there are lots of different weapons to try and a whole series of new techniques).   In addition to the main quest, there is also a ton of other stuff to do. Dozens of optional side missions are available, as well as a series of levels that take place in unique environments that utilize the free-running and platforming elements of the game to great effect (think Prince of Persia style tombs). There is also a “home base” Villa area that you can spend time upgrading and exploring if you wish. Doing so awards you with income that can be used to buy further improvements, more weapons, paintings, etc. This can potentially add hours of playtime and is completely optional. Such is the scope of this game. Perhaps my favorite “extra” bit this game offers is a sub-quest dubbed 'The Truth'. Hidden throughout the environments are glyphs that grant access to a series of puzzles, that when solved, unlock tiny portions of a mysterious video (which, when fully decoded, truly expands the mythology underlying the whole series).   What really makes all of these elements come together so well is the main character of Ezio. He is just a likeable guy and is fun to play as. It’s really as simple as that. All in all, it’s hard to ask much more from a sequel. While yes, there are still some flaws here and there, there was nothing that ruined the experience for me to any large degree. Maybe part of it is just how leaps-and-bounds better AC2 is than AC1 that it’s easy to be more forgiving of any blemishes. I suppose that could be it. But then again, it could just simply be that a good game is a good game... I’m inclined to think that’s probably the case here.  Grade: A-  Note: I don’t recommend playing any of the Assassin’s Creed games unless you have an Xbox360 controller (or equivalent-featured gamepad). The AC games have complicated control schemes and were clearly designed with controllers in mind, so proceed with mouse/keyboard at your own risk.",

The graphics were improved, missions were no longer repetitive and the combat was improved. New moves were added, new weapons, and the feature of shops. Blacksmiths, Tailors, Painters, Bankers and many more shops are located. The game is very non-linear with the chance of looking for artifacts to unlock a special armor. The voice-acting was amazing and as the story progressed, you felt for the character. Although during missions the timers are annoying, and some of the city of Florence is spaced out, I give the game a 9/10. This is an amazing game that you should buy.",

The climbing controls can make you wanna put your fist though a wall. But it's an older game now, so you can look past all those minor annoyances (also since they're approved upon in sequels). If you're looking to jump on the Assassin's Creed train, I'd suggest starting here. (The first game doesn't hold it's age well, I don't think.)

Though many of its features feel old at this point, but its still has good game play with many very interesting locals. The graphics are bar none the best on the PC; so even if you have the console versions I would still recomend this. The story is good, even if I think the animus feels tacked on.(Not as bad as the sequels)   Now the negitives I found with the PC version is a short list. The 360 controller isn't great here, and the other one is that its optimization. It staggers and drop frame rate from time to time. For the most part I get 60 fps maxed out, but for no reason it will drop to 45/50/48/60----/45. If you are a console gamer switching to the master race you may not notice, and only really noticable if you watch for it. For most PC gamers it is livable, but not optimal.   Still I recomend this game, and you should already know what you are getting into.",

A small minus is that when you are about halfway through the game, money is no longer a problem and that removes a bit of the joy of buying more and better equipment.

The first time(s) I got it on the mac side of my computer : UPLAY did not like my mac.

Thank Gwad I got this on sale! I do not see myself buying any other Ubisoft game that FORCES people to install YET ANOTHER software just to launch the damn game -- and even after doing all that the game WONT EVEN LAUNCH. STAY AWAY FROM UBISOFT and excuse me while I go get a Valium U[DONT]Play is getting on my nerves!

The only other AC I have played was Revelations, and found it not to be very good. I missed what I experienced in AC2. The only thing I did not particularly like in AC2 was the mad races, but I guess it is part of the game. After finishing the main story I still tried to find everything and that is rare for me.  I also bought Brotherhood because it seems to be a worthy follow-on. But if you are thinking about buying AC2, it is really worth it. A lot of people seems to have problems with UPlay, but honestly I have not really have had any. Only problem with the game is xbox 360 wireless controller support. Download ACII_Wireless_360_Fix_by_Khemitude.rar and extract to AC2 folder. Otherwise it is really an awesome game. ",

There are new mechanics such as picking things up, mission logs/sequencing, and looting, which are glitchy - there is certainly a delayed action feel in general to movement. There seems to be issues with the dubbing as well being massively out of time with the actions of characters, which can lead to amusing/tedious mime shows during set pieces. I suspect as a result of all the new added features the interface between map and other tools is a little unwieldly. But whilst some of these can be frustrating, there arn't enough to seriously dampen an interesting and enjoyable game.  UPDATE Having now completed the game, I would say the lack of a difficulty curve is balanced by the at times flailing control system. There were several points which felt like a natural end point, but which were then padded out to add a bit of time. Overall, I still have a positive opinion, and I like a lot of the new additions a lot (thanks gods for the fast travel system) - but I think I had more fun with the first game in the series.",

The storyline seems quite good and there are a lot of side missions (although more than a few of them are classic copy pasted fetch quests) which add a bit of depth. The game world is not the most immersive I have ever seen but it is nevertheless very much alive and the atmosphere is well conveyed. A lot of the game revolves around platforming, which is for the most part a fluid and enjoyable experience although occassionally Ubisoft's daft 'One button does 200 things!' design philosophy means I end up leaping backwards 15 metres when I actually wanted to silently climb up to the next windowledge.

But still, engage in the best story in the franchise where you can journey through cities in Italy, ride horses, hire some hookers, and climb some of the best architecture in Italy as Ezio, that you'll be playing in the next two games as well.

From a guy who was raised on Mario games and various 'Wii' games, I didn't have the luxury to play these kinds of games. I was 17 when I bought this game.  Seven-freaking-teen. My first rated 'M' game. At 17. Yes, you could very well say I was sheltered. And rightfully so.  When I was at the checkout to buy this game, I was sweating. Sad, but true. Thoughts raced through my head; Will I get in trouble? Would I really get away with this? After all, a rated 'M' game in my family was strictly taboo. I swallowed my cowardly fear and purchased the game.   About an hour or so later, the download was finished. I was so close to playing this game. Will it be any good? Will it be worth it?  About an hour in the game, all fears washed away. I was in love. This was the game that started my obsession with the franchise. This is the game that truly started my love for third-person stealth-action games. It showed me that video games can tell great stories, share loved memories, and can take my breath away. It showed me that even video games can have a beautiful soundtrack, just like the movies. I still listen to it whenever I am studying and trying to relax. Heck, I even gained an intrest in speaking Italian. Sure, the port isn't the best thing out there, the combat can be frustrating at some points, and the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ feathers, but it still left an impact on my mind.  A couple days later, my mom found out and was very disappointed. But it didn't matter. I played a game that changed the way I looked at video games.   Nothing is true, everything is permitted.   8.9/10 would relive those memories again.",

Most of the game consisted of me screaming at Ezio to 'GO UP!! GO UP!!'  Control scheme aside, the game suffered from stale combat mechanics, repetitive tasks, boring assassinations (don't bother sneaking about; just make a b-line for your target, do the deed, and run away frantically), and repetitive tasks. For a game about assassins, there were disappointingly few stealth tactics.  Finally, my biggest frustration with modern games was displayed prominently in Assassin's Creed 2: Gameplay takes a backseat to the story. If I wasn't stabbing those obnoxious lute players for my own twisted amusement, I was running to get from unskippable cutscene A to unskippable cutscene B... to unskippable cutscene C. Frankly, I didn't find the story or its characters to be terrifically compelling. For a noble's son, Ezio gains his aptitude for senseless killing suspiciously quickly. And two games later, I'm still not sure why the Templars and the Assassins are forever at war, but I am sure that I don't care.  I know I'm in the minority here, but AC2 is all about free-thinking and individuality. Or something. I wasn't really paying attention.

Combat is fun, and for anyone who has played Assassin's Creed 1, the combat is much improved and varied because of all the different skills and weapons you have.   If you have a very good graphics card, then the PC version is great. Otherwise, I would stick with the console version for a more enjoyable experience. I am going to give this game a 9/10 because it was fun even though I wasn't able to run the game very well.",

From there, you travel to a safe house where you meet two new characters who are going to help you dive into the past of another one of your ancestors. The premise is that you can learn how to be an assassin in present day by reliving the life of your ancestor. Unlike last time, you'll now be reliving the life of Ezio during Renaissance Italy.  Basically everything in this game was improved. All of the original mechanics still exist with a few added extras. You can now buy and upgrade the villa where your family relocates. Upgrades give you more income. Likewise, collecting paintings, new weapons, new armor, or other items increase the value of your villa as well. The only downside is that there is that once you begin collecting/building, your income skyrockets and there quickly becomes nothing left to buy. I ended the game with well over 400k florins (the currency) because there was nothing left to buy. Also improved was the side-quests. These quests don't seem as random or pointless as in the original and unlike the original, they continue to challenge. While two quests different quests might require you to assassin someone without being seen, the circumstances of those missions are so different, they hardly feel the same.  The only thing I didn't like about this game was Uplay. It's not so much that I don't like signing up for Uplay or that I feel annoyed my game is forever attached to my Uplay account (after all, that's basically the same as Steam). But what frustrated me was that Uplay would open every time I exited the game. If you are using Big Picture mode and a controller, this is problematic mainly because you can't close the window with a controller; you need to grab your mouse. I got around this by setting up a Pinnacle Game Profile to run when Uplay runs so that through a few button presses, I can control the mouse and close the window. Despite this annoyance, I would recommend this to anyone who likes stealth/open world games.",

Its got at least 24 hours of story gameplay and masses on top of that with various collectibles and side quests. I loved this game and bought it based on a 5 minute trial I had on it at a friends house. At the same time I bought the 3 sequels Brotherhood, Revelations and AC III.  What I'll remember most about this game is the free running ability and massive roaming pleasure jumping from ledge to ledge. You can choose your own play style too. Sneak up the streets darting from crowd to crowd, leap from the rooftops knife first onto your target, walk straight up to them and shoot them in the face in front of everybody, or charge them with your sword and make chase.  The story is good too, but what stands out is the action gameplay in this game. Various kill sequences can be used which look amazing.  A game I will love playing for many more hours to come, and have done for many hours passed.",

Locales are detailed sufficiently to put you the setting, a few building interiors are nice but nothing wowing. Game plays 90% fine on a keyboard.  Gameplay wise, it improves a bit over its original in options and combat, as well as platforming, but the fastwalk dual-mapped to pickpocket, grab / release on hand, and jump / sprint being overzealously applied is quite frustrating at times. Some enemies are immune to smoke bombs, being shot, backstabs, etc for no real reason other than plot armor, which feels stupid. The inclusion of the Hidden Gun feels like a nod to the frustration of catching running enemies, but bugs the camera. Enemy soldiers still pose 0 threat.  Story and characters are much better, even if slow to start.",

Sidequests: Check, most of them are really fun to complete and give you insigths on life in the Renaissance. You don't have to complete them though, but many are rewarding. Restoring your town to its former glory for example, and seeing it slowly grow more prosperous with people visiting and the run down walls and buildings repaired.  Characters: OH GOD YES. No offense to Altaïr but he is as charismatic as a block of wood. Ezio feels like a real person, whom we see grow over the years from a brash punk into a wise man. And the enemies are great! Which brings us to...  Story: The story of the first Assassins Creed was a little rushed and offered no explanations to what the ♥♥♥♥ was happening. They fixed that here. First, you have a codex that you can read for reference on the time period, people and buildings you visit giving much needed context. Second, the grand scheme of things is set, the events that happen in the past and present make sense and leave room for interesting mysteries and developments and COMPLETE THE SUBJECT 16 QUEST FOR EXTRA MIND♥♥♥♥.

            "review_text": "Assassin's Creed 2 is my favorite game in the series to date, and the absolute crown gem when it comes to the series' best gimmick - throwing you into beautiful, well-researched historical worlds and just letting you do whatever you want with them.  Premise: Desmond Miles is being held captive by the Templars! Early in the game, he escapes with the help of their mortal enemies, the Assassins. To join the Assassins, Desmond trains by reliving the memories of one of his ancestors, Ezio. Ezio is an Italian living in the 15th century Renaissance. He is drawn into the life of the Assassins in order to discover the perpetrators of a political plot that threatens his family. Along the way, he assassinates dozens of people, and leaps off a lot of towers.  The Good: Almost any bad thing you could say about the first game in this series, AC2 cleans up pretty nicely. The sometimes awkward exposition and cutscenes of 1 are replaced by a sleek, modern story with high-quality cutscenes. The story is paced much better. The controls are simpler. Meanwhile, the strong points of 1 are even stronger here. Ezio is probably my favorite Assassin of the series, transitioning from a fun-loving Aladdin expy to a brilliant, manipulative and powerful one man army out for revenge on the Templar order. Ezio's family and friends are also fun and likeable, including a pretty unusual take on Leonardo da Vinci. It is easy to switch between playing the excellent main storyline and just tooling around Venice doing random sidequests and challenges. The side missions are very fun, but they also don't feel like forced side missions - if you aren't feeling them right now, you can come back to them later or not at all without any consequences. My favorite part of the game is the beautiful recreation of the cities. If you're anything like me, you could enjoy yourself a lot just running around without even doing anything. Most games in a setting like this feel like games in a setting - but I came away from this feeling a bit like I had honestly been to Italy and absorbed a little culture. Finally, combat is improved from the original, and you have a few more options for both smashmouth and stealthy play.  The Bad: I have nothing I can really think of to complain about in this game. I'm sorry that you're going to have to use uPlay for it. It's really a terrible platform.  Conclusion: In my opinion the magnum opus of the Assassin's Creed series. Worth it for the magnificent Italian cities alone, but also very well-done in terms of story and gameplay. If AC1 was a flawed game brimming with innovation and potential, AC2 was the realization of all the series could be.",

            "review_text": "TL:DR If you're looking to buy an Assassins Creed game but unsure of which to get, then make it this one. Its a few years old by now but still one of the best, if not the best in the series.  Full Review: Assassins Creed 2 is, for me, still the most enjoyable game of the AC series. The game follows Ezio Auditore ,an Italian descendant of the first games protaganist Altair, as he goes from a young man who witnesses his family killed as part of a Templar plot to an experienced member of the Assassin order. The game has some beautiful locations with the cities of Florence and Venice as well as some smaller countryside areas. Theres a lot of side stuff to do like assasination contracts or doing up your villa but the main story is still really enjoyable with some great missions thrown in.  Good points: -Florence and Venice both look amazing and feel completely different to each other with the beautiful buildings and streets of Florence and Venice having its famous canals. - Ezio is a great character as he's both likeable and charismatic and its easy to sympathize with his journey. Compared to Altair or Connor from the other AC games he's still by far the best protaganist. - The story missions are both fun and enjoyable a lot of oppurtunities to put your assassin skills to work as well as the variety of gadgets and weapons Ezio acquires. -This version comes with both DLC expansions, The Battle of Forli and Bonfire of the Vanities.  Bad points: - Combat is a bit too easy. You can win most fights by countering enemies and hammering the attack button. Enemies also tend to stand off and attack one or two at a time so its easy to take on big groups of enemies. - The parkour free running is good but canbe frustrating as it tends to be a bit inaccurate at times. I'd often have Ezio jump the wrong way or crash into a wall which is especially frustrating when your chasing someone or trying to flee from guards.",

On one early quest the objective would not show up on the map, so I had to restart the game to bring it back. Around that very quest the game would also crashes or freezes.  Notable is how the frame rate drops beyond sluggishness every time I access the map. The menus tend to have an FPS drop as well. Must be some weird programming, as I'm running on a brand new fairly high end desktop.  Also worth adding is that the game at first wouldn't start at all. I had to uninstall the Ubi launcher that came with the game, then download and install a new version of it, as recommended by other players.

I still prefer Altair to Ezio that being that he's already an established assassin who everyone knows about as an assassin but not his name (other than the people in the brotherhood). The one thing that put me off is everyone knew Ezio's name and who he was with his getup, there really was no point to him wearing the assassin's outfit other than paying dues to his father and family. Ezio felt like a very rookie assassin to me, it really bothered me that I felt 80% of the game I was just avenging his family's losses out of revenge and you were put though the learning process of Eden, Templars and the Assassin brotherhood.  Bringing power back to the people and ridding each area of corruption had it's satisfaction on it's own and felt great knowing you made a difference to the areas you visited making Italy a better place again. It is a bit silly however you are given capes of recognition but simply climbing a rooftop is considered a crime? I understand if the guards attack you with the cape if you have killed a civilian or another guard but the cape itself is supposed to be an entitlement for your services to the city and it's people so why be targeted for climbing or accessing restricted areas?  I don't like collecting coupious amounts of items for such little gain and this game has a ton of them, little more less than the first game but still a lot.  I didn't particularly like having to read subtitles for half english and half Italian spoken dialogue, I do appreciate it added depth to cutscenes and learned some Italian here and there but I couldn't help but get lost a few times or spaced out. I thought in the first game all was translated to English when Desmond asked Lucy. Perhaps things have changed I guess.  8/10. Not bothered to collect the other assassin's stone tablet things at this point in time, maybe after I finish AC 3 to access Altair's armor.",

That moment you get the second hidden blade is just satisfying. Then ezio gains a hidden pistol, which was also fun. I've played through this game several times... IDK, maybe I am partial due to my nostalgia and overall love for the Ezio games.  The game is not perfect though. As with most AC games, thee main charecter, Ezio in this case, does not always do what you want him to. Trying to climb boxes in front of you sometimes leads to running up the adjacent wall, or just jumping over boxes atogether. Most of the time this problem is negligable, except during the most frustrating aspect of this game: timed puzzles. Specifically, a good number of Assassin's Tombs. Many of the tombs have timed areas and if Ezio jumps in the water or at the wall instead of jumping to that beam... welll, you have to start over. If you don't care about getting 100% or getting Altair's armor, then skip these puzzles. Honestly, you can beat the game easily without upgrading your health much. The only reason I fully upgrade Ezio's heath is so that if Ezio decides to jump off a tall building without my permission, he will live.  Wow, that was a ramble.
