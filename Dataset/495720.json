            "review_text": "Intrude is a fun little fps that recaptures the essence of the original wolfenstein games. The game is well polished, has a great visual style, and is decently challenging as well. One thing that personally frustrates me with this game is that if you die it's right back to the beginning of the level. There's no real way to save your progress whilst your in the middle of a level like in the old wolfenstein/Doom games, which isn't the end of the world or a deal breaker, more so just an annoyance. The levels are also a bit repettetive in terms of the same floor and wall textures, however this is slightly eleviated via each levels design. The weapons feel punchy and satisfying to use. But one major thing to not is that this game in no way reinvents the wheel, that is to say It's very similar to the original wolfenstein, though I personally prefer this to that. I'm having alot of fun thus far with the game, and would happily suggest it to anyone wondering if they should get it.",
