            "review_text": "Excellent pocket-sized shooter that requires a bit of trigger control: Shoot at everything you see and you wont be getting far as targets need to be picked so you can chain-destroy as many as you can to clear a path for your ship to advance.   You will be needing some actual shmup skills too as there is a end boss at the end of every level. Get killed by it and back to the beginning you go.   Very good game considering how simple it is. If i must find something bad then that would be the nasty achievement structure of the game as you wont be bagging any of them until you reach the very end of the game. It is like the whole game is just one big training session until you get to the real deal challenge at the end. (by which time you should also be good enough to pick yourself the ship and upgrades that will save the day) . At 3.99€ normal price this one is easy to recommend.",

            "review_text": "Phew...this was both great AND a disappointment. I bought this in a bundle was desperately waiting for it to be released on steam. Was really looking forward to it AND I really enjoyed most of the game.  The pixel art is perfect, ship hitbox a little big but the many ships are cool. Upgrades for your ships are limited, as well as the upgradability. One thing that bugs me about the ships, at certain points only one ship really makes, but overall it's okay.  'Puzzling' through levels feels good and the boss battles are moderately challenging, it's a small colorful and fun game worth it's money.  But still there are things I can't ignore. I really enjoyed the game until I faced Boss Rush Mode. Going through all the bosses with one hit meaning your demise is a bit too much. Uninstalled and ignored the fact of several updates, I was too ♥♥♥♥♥♥ over that. Thought I'd give it a try and failed miserably until RNG was on my side after lots of tries.   Another thing is the limited Controller support and a bugged keyboard setting. I understand that some problems can't be taken on easily, but not even responding in the discussions is pretty weak when there are only 4-5 ones open (at the time I posted mine)  I do recommend this game for it's style, looks and rather fresh gameplay...and if you want to 100% it...only under the premise you're resistant to frustration.",

            "review_text": "Fun enough for a $4 game. Kinda corny but its kind of self aware. Also, brings a cool puzzle mechanic to the SHMUP style Bosses are kind of annoying due to be a standard 'bullet hell' type boss. It's less annoying in boss rush because you don't have to do a whole level prior to getting annihalated and having to do it all again.   Would be cool to see speacial attacks added or bombs, maybe a '1 use per stage' weapon, to get out of a jam, or help kill the boss if you can keep yourself from wasting it during the stage.   Anyway, I got mine in a bundle but I'd say its a sure buy for so cheap on steam, no real replay value but a solid ~5-6 hours of gameplay. If you include getting all the achievements, might be a little longer but boss rush is nearly impossible so that's hard to calculate.",

            "review_text": "It was fun at start... nice concept, original interesting idea but it wears off pretty quickly and becomes boring. I have almost 12 hours played where hours I have been trying to finish last boss (that Crab flying thing) and I am just bored to death by repeating the same level (despite its random factor, it just feels the same) and I decided to not recommend this game. Maybe a hardcore shmup could appreciate it, but to me the difficulty level is just too hardcore with that Crab boss",
