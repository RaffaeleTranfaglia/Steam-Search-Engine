            "review_text": "Normally twin stick shooters aren't really my thing. I've gotten decently into a few of them (most notably Beat Hazard), but I'm not the sort of person who can top leaderboards, and twin sticks are usually all about efficiently racking up the best possible score. I suppose you could say I'm on friendly terms with the devs though, so when they (full disclosure here) gave me a key for the game to test something for them I decided I'd put the game through its paces and let them and you all know what I thought about it.  The first thing that stuck out to me was how well-designed the enemies are. A lot of twin stick shooters end up feeling the same to me because the enemies are usually few and the strategies to handle them are similar. With this game, however, they constantly throw new enemies at you, some building on old concepts and some introducing radically new approaches. I'm far from an expert on the genre, but I've played my fair share of these games and I've run into some particularly novel enemy behaviors I've never seen combined in quite the same way before. One of the early types that stood out to me was the Bull, a large ship that takes a few seconds to lock on before charging at you in a straight line, exploding if it hits a wall. Depending on the situation you might want to shoot it down, get in close and use the Explosion ability to make shooting it down faster, or just avoid it entirely and let it crash into the wall. Each enemy is usually handled differently, and the way they constantly evolve enemy variety and group up enemies in different combinations keeps your head constantly in the game without leaving a second to get bored.  One of the cooler curveballs the game throws at you is the stealth servers. There's an enemy type that will track your movements so long as you fire, and will go to your last known location when you cease firing. They start you with this one basic element, then start adding enemies that can reveal your position if you get close, or be able to come after you once enough time has passed, similarly to a Bull. Mixing in normal enemy types allows for even more possibilities. Running around while the whole world is coming down on your head, finding an escape and letting all the enemies gather around your last position, then gunning them down as they whirl back on you is incredibly satisfying.  With all that said though, the game's certainly not perfect. For example, in Level 4 you're thrown against a boss that more-or-less requires one specific loadout. I threw my face into its fist a few dozen times before I gave up, quit out, changed my equipment and went through the whole level again. The boss features one to three (they get added as you hurt it) spinning invulnerable rings with holes to shoot through. I went into the stage with the starting loadout, but the regular gun shoots too wide to be useful against the small holes (I switched to the more focused Machine Gun), the ship moves too slowly to get around the boss sometimes (switched both perks to ship speed), and the timing to get a shot through all three barriers by the end is extremely tight (I switched to the Freezing Bomb to hold it in place). With the loadout tailored to the boss I was able to deal with it with much less frustration.  I also found that I don't really like most of the equipment the game has to offer and usually stick with the most basic options. For the main gun especially the standard weapon felt the most effective. The others seem to offer a better risk:reward ratio and higher skill ceiling, but (in my hands at least) they don't feel as potent, nor have the same kind of variety the enemies do. The machine gun and missiles, for example, seem to be practically the same thing.  In a lot of ways I feel Tachyon Project is similar to Super Toy Cars, the dev's previous game. It had some rough edges,  but it did what it did extremely well . In the case of Super Toy Cars, they absolutely nailed handling, making the driving experience fun and engaging. Here we see much the same thing: there's a strong focus on the mechanics, in making sure that every single second of gameplay keeps the player hooked. There's a story, but honestly it's entirely skippable (both figuratively and literally). The art is passable, does its job and little beyond that. Music's okay too, though nothing really spectacular. But what really sells this game, and why you should play it, is because it's just  so much fun . I've never played a twin stick shooter that felt more active and alive than this one.",
