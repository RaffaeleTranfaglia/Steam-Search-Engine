            "review_text": "A procedrually generated space themed environmental puzzle game with a focus on exploration and navigation. Puzzles are procedurally generated and run the range of obvious and simple to clever and surprising. And sometimes even after the anamoly is solved there will still be things to do and discover on the planet, revealing easter eggs and other surprises. Once an anomaly is solved you get the right to name the star, as players explore the galaxy and solve anomalies the galaxy fills up with the unique signatures of various astronauts. This is a starkly beautiful game, evocative of the Italian underground indie freeware classic Noctis. The visual themes call back to Kubrick and Tarkovsky's work. This game is all about the journey.",

            "review_text": "I hardly write reviews, it's not my thing but I am really frustrated with this game... I thought it would be so fun but, oh, how mistaken I was... It's so annoying and frustrating. You will be walking on a surface of a celestial body in first person, where you can't look up nor down, just forward and to the sides, also you can't see very far too. It's pretty much like the Spore's worlds, but worse because it is empty and in a very smaller scale. There's no tutorial nor explanation of what you have to do. That means you will first be worried if your mouse is working correctly, since you can't look up and down, then you may think that it may be an issue with your gamepad, if it is plugged in. But then you will understand that this is just an annoying limitation for some reason. Without knowing where to go or what to do, you will, eventually, discover that the celestial body up there is actually a map and by 'upgrading' your, err, 'gravitational gun' you can drag it around, which will also be a pain since you can't look up you will have to align yourself with it.  There's a map and a kind of travel machine that is really, really weird and a pain to use it properly. You will find yourself flipping switches without knowing what you may be doing, as always...  In sum, you will be aimless walking on a empty surface doing stuff that you are not sure what nor why.   I would not recommend this game to anyone, not even for its art.",

If (like me) you are the kind of person who is willing to pay money for something of which you think 'good or bad, this should be interesting', then I can wholeheartedly recommend this game for the opening level alone. Messing around in the spacecraft is good too, so try that as well. It makes space feel simultaneously agoraphobic and claustrophobic.  For better or worse, this is a game that tries to give its player something that they could not have looked for. It therefore does not try to be 'fun' per se. This is pure exploration of the utter unkown. You are told nothing but the title, and what's out there is up to you not only to find but to interpret. If you want a game that explains itself to you and lets you get busy having fun, this is not it. If you are in the mood for a game that is itself a puzzle and a mystery, get this now.  I don't know whether I will ever launch this game again, but I found the experience powerful and haunting.",

I became a space traveler... I learned to navigate the stars through trial and error. Space became meaningful to me. I am now an experienced astronomical navigator. Even making simple pit stops to check out an unnamed star system, that I knew wasn't a destination I was looking for, was really satisfying.  Yes, it's a little slow paced, it requires a little patience, but it rewards you for your curiosity. This game is serious fun, and incredibly beautiful! I can't recommend it enough.",

The puzzle aspect of the game involves mostly navigation and manipulating the moon, which in my opinion, does not form a real puzzle game.   While I got this game for less than a dollar from a now expired Humble Bundle, I recommend that you do not spend $9.99 without knowing what the game is trying to sell, and whether you'd be comfortable with Santa Ragione's execution of those concepts.",

The puzzles are very difficult, but not having any hints or anything really made them feel rewarding when I finally figured out the solution.  The graphics are very simple, but I think they work quite well. The game is very colorful and lively, despite how baren the planet actually is. The 'ship' interface is also very fun to play around with because it has a lot of switches and buttons, most of which don't appear to do anything of significance.   Overall I highly recommend this game, especially if you're looking for something unlike anything you've ever played before.",

Do not expect any context or guidance, because you pretty much have to figure everything out for yourself as far as goals and progression concerned. That being said, exploration seems to be the heart of the experience. Taking in the variations of each planet and trying to see what you can do on each one is a highly atmospheric experience if you can keep yourself in-game for long enough. I'd relate it to Proteus in that way. There is a general sense of wonder across every environment, aided by the dichotomous light and dark color schemes and minimalist soundtrack. It's a somewhat eerie atmosphere at times. Definitely worth the $2 on sale. $10? Not so sure. It depends on whether you can appreciate the atmosphere.  tl;dr A E S T H E T I C",

But it left me with an itch I wanted to scratch. Mirrormoon EP however fails to scratch that itch. While I like the minimalist approach and clean visuals, exploring the planets is boring. Mostly because they aren't proper planets at all. You can see the horizon bend and circumnavigate any planet in five minutes. Even Pluto, now demoted to a dwarf planet, isn't that small and featureless. The planets all look alike except for the colour palette and some minimal debris here and there. Once you've seen one planet, you've really seen them all. There are puzzles on each planet (actually it seems to be the same puzzle over and over again), but I don't want a puzzle game, I want a game about exploration. I want to see beautiful vistas, meet strange animals, find crumbled old ruins, things like that. If you're looking for something similar to Noctis, skip this game. It's an abstract puzzle game that's only posing as a space exploration game.",

Side A gave me a sense of discovery and 'Oh...Oh!....OHHHH!', as  clanmurph  put it, that I haven't had since I played the original Portal. Side B, similarly, is all about organically discovering the rules, mechanics, and objectives of the game, but at a much slower pace, and with a much greater emphasis on exploration.  The game took me 10 hours to beat, although YMMV, as it largely depends on what you randomly find as you explore. This was also the first game in a long time that forced me to take down notes with a pen and paper, as well as compulsively screenshot everything.  This game gave me the break I needed from overdosing on Fallout 4, and I can highly recommend it to anyone who wants to be set loose in a world where they have to figure everything out for themselves from the ground up.",
