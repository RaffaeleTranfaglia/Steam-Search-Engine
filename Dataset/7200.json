The only Trackmania game I had played at the time was the original. I picked it up for 5 bucks at a convention, not knoning what I would discover. I loved the track editor, and the consistant car handling making the time trials pure skill and pathfinding. Trackmania United it the refined accumulated verision of all 3 the Trackmania PC games before Trackmania 2.   It's a great hot wheel style racing, It's tight. it's right. The content creation within the game is incredibly accessible enabling new content to be continuously created by players. I often play online without experiencing playing the same track twice. Anyone can easily create playable tracks resulting in a gigantic amount of tracks existing.   THe online community in this game is still huge and full of dedication. For example, there's a site for sharing tracks and racetimes online that's still lively.   united.tm-exchange.com   Love this game. Great if you like this stuff. The competitiveness can be intense, and it can be joyful to shave a few crucial miliseconds off your best time.",

It features all the environments (different playstyles basically) from the original Trackmania, Trackmania Sunrise and Trackmania Nations. I don't think it is worth buying as a standalone game nowadays, as the community is pretty much dead. It is a great addition to the 'Celebrat10n TrackMania Complete Pack', however, and I recommend to check it out alongside with TrackMania 2 titles if you like competitive racing games.",

            "review_text": "Has more in common with mario kart than with forza. If you're looking for a serious racing game, this isn't it... but if you've already beaten plants vs. zombies and peggle and are looking for something mindless to do while listening to audio books, this will fit the bill perfectly.  The only multiplayer mode is concurrent time trials, which works quite well. Since you're mainly racing the clock, you can restart the race at any time and won't be unduly affected by lag or cheats. However, the lack of variety means the game itself won't hold your interest for long unless you're playing with friends or also listening to podcasts at the same time.  All cars in a given race mode handle exactly the same. There is no car customization outside of your car's paint and model, but that's quite fun in itself. No plot. None of the annoying interruptions that are so common in other racing games such as cutscenes, slow menus, and crash cams. You can jump directly from one lap to the next. There is a 1 minute delay between races every time the server switches tracks, but otherwise the fun is uninterrupted.  There is a huge number of tracks but all are constructed from the same set of sections, so the variety is limited. Most tracks can be driven fairly close to top speed for most of the race - late braking isn't a part of the game. The game is mainly about finding the shortest path through the track that doesn't result in a crash.  The free version requires spectating every few races but otherwise gets access to most of the content. This isn't pay-to-win. Free players don't play at a disadvantage. I paid for the full version and I found it to be worth the price in order to play uninterrupted. Paid players also get access to several other modes including many tracks, different track types, and a new type of car for each track type. Unfortunately, the paid servers are normally empty so you'll still spend most of your time racing the same tracks as the free players.  If you think of this as a casual game, you'll get some fun out of it. If you're looking for a realistic driving sim, look elsewhere. ",

            "review_text": "Trackmania is the kind of game that always slips under the US radar. It's most popular in Europe, due to Nadeo being a French company.  But let me get this straight with you: You're missing out if you're not buying this, or at least trying the free Trackmania Nations.  Not only is it a racing game, it's a racing game  where you can make your own tracks.  And the track editor isn't a piece of junk, either - it has tons of options, leading to a world of possibilities. If making tracks isn't your thing, though, there are plenty of challenges to beat from Nadeo and the Trackmania community. Plus, there are 7 environments with 7 different vehicles, each of which handle very differently. Couple that with online play that's still going after all these years after release, and you've got a winner.  Seriously, at least try out Nations. It's free, and it's worth your while, even with one environment. But once you're ready to take it a step further, remember this review.",

Point being, I've had this game for years and I've  never been allowed to play it.   Good game though, if they let you play it when you buy it.",

Not only can you give yourself a challenge with interesting tracks against great AI, you can build whatever you want with the resources you're given.

At core the game combines the mechanics of a puzzler with a race driver, but the emphasis is squarely on the driving and the driving is FUN. Unfortunately there's little real racing going on since 90% of your time is spent in 'time attack' mode, but online play allows for real-time competitive time attack. There's a bazillion user created racetracks to download and master on top of the built in designs and your success earns money allowing you to buy new cars, track elements. There are seven different track environments and seven car types which are uniquely challenging, and the design of the tracks can become absolutely diabolical when gunning for a perfect score. As a break from beating the existing tracks you can try building your own tracks through the money you've earned and see how creative you can get, it's like a kids slot car toy on steroids.

You have ten minutes to lose ? Why not play a little track ? Two hours to lose ? Make that three. A game that you can play like you eat popcorn ot that you can appreciate like a fine wine.
