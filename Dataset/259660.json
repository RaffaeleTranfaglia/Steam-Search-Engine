Seriously, what else is on that list? Battlezone? Hostile Waters: Antaeus Rising?  We get a new game like this about every 5 years, so it's reassuring to see the care and attention and just plain love that was invested into the development of this one.  I can confidently recommend this game for RTS fans and also for space combat fans. You really can play it either way, and the freedom to hop back and forth means that it never, ever gets dull.",

Void Destroyers allows you to actually pilot one of those fighters, so that you can single handedly turn the tide of an unfavorable battle with your own skill and desperation.  This game is a passionate labour of love by its creator, and this passion shows is countless details. Anyone who loves the Homeworld games should pick this up, if only to tide them over until Gearbox finally releases the remastered Homeworld games. By the time they release though, you will be wishing that you could take direct control of a Vargyr Plasma Lance fighter or Hiigaran Interceptor to save a poor isolated mining outpost against overwhelming odds.",

I highly recommend it to anyone who loves the idea of being able to control and fly the ships in a RTS fleet they build (including capital ships). Just be forwarned you are going to have to learn a pretty advanced hotkey system to be able to use everything efficiently as possible.  8/10. At release, 9/10 if they ever add multiplayer post launch.",

            "review_text": "Void Destroyer  This is seriously a gem among games. First off this isn't your typical space sim such as the X series or Elite Dangerous. This is quite simply the perfect hybrid of RTS and FPS. Now as such every games has its pros and cons and here is my list of a few of each however please keep in mind 'User Experiance may Very'  Pros -Great playablity with awesome mechanics. The game was well thought out as far as strengths and weaknesses go and there was a overal balance to the game. -Actually makes you think. There is a high difficulty curve that can stop some players in there tracks however this is also what makes the game fun because you actually have to be engaged in order to beat it. -the ships look awesome. thats really all I have to say for that.  Cons -The story seems bland. there isn't much customer progression or even story lore.  -the controls can be a little perplexing and it takes a second to get used to the different playing styles of each ship. -The difficulty curve can be bothersome. I have allways been more of a story type player so the dificulty spike didn't really read to me. I also felt that the balance was of and more in favor of the AI. However I like to mod my games so I fixed that by adjusting the values of the ships. (even though I did that I still got my but kicked a few times by the AI -There isn't alot of replayability after the game is won.  Conclusion &amp; extra facts to consider  In conclusion this is truly a gem among coals. Sure it has some problems but it is probably one of the best games I have ever seen. I actually interviewed the Developer a few years ago about this game and asked him about the whole development process (I did this for a class I was taking at the time) If you consider the fact that this game was made in the basement (I am Assuming) of his house BY HIM SELF than i don't care what probles It has it is well worth the price and time spent. seriously pick up the game and make it work for you if you need to. It is worth it.",

Well it's a mixture of rts, fps, tps and has economical elements. you don't lead your troops from a nice comfy office you lead it from the front lines! you fight because YOU can die not just for your troops.

            "review_text": "I see alot of 'I wanted to like...' which really should tell you all you need to know. That sentence could also be: 'My own expectations ruined what could have been a unique, enjoyable experience.'  Go ahead and watch the first 30 seconds of the first video on this here store page. Do you see all the red diamonds? Those are enemies. See all the bullets flying set to the epic music? It's a hailstorm, literally. Void Destroyer is absolutely the best space game I have ever played. Void Destroyer was so incredibly epic, I explored the entire genre. I hadn't played a space sim since microsoft's flight sim 95. RPGs, RTS, FPS, TBS, 4X, etc are more my wheelhouse. Because of Void Destroyer I tried Rebel Galaxy, Starpoint Gemini 2, SPAZ 1+2, Space Rangers 2, Starsector, even X2:AP. All fine games, some excellent, nothing quite like VD.  So what is Void Destroyer? It's a realistic space combat sim with rts functions, realtime pause, and giant setpiece missions. Example: Second mission kicks you in the nuts, because a ship with a giant drill on the front is literally ripping though you, oh my! Hmm, try to turn and shoot the drill? ♥♥♥♥, that drill is armored. Pause, click fleet, click frigates tab (your giant ship killers), click enemy drill ship! Proceed to kite giant enemy drill while your hitters pound the drill ship in the back for 2 minutes. Feel accomplishment! You just exhibited problem solving! What follows is about 15 missions that range from attacking and capturing bases, building ships, attacking enemy lines, navigating through minefields, defending those bases, tactical retreats, saving the universe, etc etc.  Now to rebut some of the top rated complaints: I have finished the game, I believe I even got that sweet 0.4% ending. You can select groups of ships, in tactical (rts) view: click fleet, click their tab, done. Shaky Controls? Likely ghost input from another controller, etc. There's an option to disable. I had no experience with bugs or crashes in main game, no stutter. Game is very very smooth. Capital ship abilities? Awesome. Hilarious that the dude who listed 2 of my favorite: pull ship and capture ship didn't think to put them together. Almost every ship can be captured until the very endgame enemies. Remember that drill ship? You fight a similiar one later, I pulled and captured it and he helped me save the universe. Shield does block lasers, pudge style rot(radiation), use retreat skill, use heal skill and you just did massive aoe damage. Super weapon on first ship? Secondary weaponfire is 'X', check controls.   Just a ton of bad information and whining.  Teardrop drones? Kill their carriers before they swarm you (called frogs), or switch over you one of your smaller ships and shoot them off like a cleaner fish does for a whale! Don't forget you can pause at anytime to look around, take stock of your situation, evaluate, plan, execute.  The combat controls are tight and responsive, there are tutorials and text guides. There is nothing else like this where you have an excellent 6DOF shooter combined with rts scale battles. It really is amazing, if you have half a backbone give it a chance. It won't let you down. Hell if you still can't beat the drill, it's not the game, it's you. :)",

I've never reviewed any game, but the disengenious store page copy infuriates me to no end, and since I can't just get a refund, this is my only option.  While the game louds that it supports multiple play styles and pretends to allow gamepad input, it does not. If you want to use a game pad you will be able to roll your ship and fire the main weapon. End of list. You cannot accelerate, turn, pitch up, or anything else.  There is an interface to set the controls, and it simply refuses to set the controls. I was able to add 'fire secondary weapon' to a trigger after about 10 minutes of trying. Everything about the games interface claims it will allow a joystick or gamepad, but it doesn't.  If you're looking for a game that lets you dogfight using your joystick or gamepad, I suggest buying any chess simulator, it will be closer to the experience you're looking for than this game.  And yes, I've played plenty of dog fighting games using my gamepad (this exact gamepad) and it's never had an issue with any of those, as well as dozens of other games. It's just a run of the mill logitech.",

            "review_text": "A potentially good game unfortunately bedevilled by niggling problems that rob it of its fun. A poor UI makes it really tough to tell what's going on, particularly in combat. It's hard to tell who's close to you, who's shooting at you, who you need to be prioritizing going up against. The game's dark color palette and huge array of keyboard shortcuts exacerbate the confusion. Other poor decisions weigh down the entire game, particularly the decision to give you a Command Ship whose death instantly ends the game for you. The entire idea of manually taking control of ships is questionable when you're responsible for coordinating production, targeting, defense, and fleet coordination, and the dogfighting unfortunately most boils down to 'try to keep your reticule over the little circle that shows you where to shoot'.  There's potential under here, and it's a particularly frustrating game because you want to like it. But it's hard to. In the end, I think you're much better off buying the Homeworld Remastered for your space RTS, and getting your dogfighting fix elsewhere.",
