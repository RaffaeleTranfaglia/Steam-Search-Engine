With that said, a note to the devs, for future endeavors You should implement some sort of blocking volume or fix the collision with the walls. You can get close to the wall and look through it to see the other side.",

Feels like Van Gogh painting come to life and you can move around in it and see from all angles. The detail that they created with this experience is amazing. I did it on Vive and it allows roomscale walking around and you can teleport around to see not just one single painting, but the whole cafe with a few rooms. It's not just a still life, but the painting is alive with moving characters. Bravisimo or whatever means f'in awesome. Will keep this to show off to anyone that I show VR to.",
