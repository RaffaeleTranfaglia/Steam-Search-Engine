Some stability issues and a few things that should be added such as laders or different outfits. Combat has a large learning curve to it but base construction is quite simple.  You wont see overwelmingly vasts structures like you would in say minecraft. Though some players do some amazing things with whats there ive been in aww of quite a few. If your into midevil roleplay you would have alot of fun with it as there are a variaty of different player owned servers with a large degree of varience on play styles, ranging from all out army warfare to no KOS roleplay.",

The game doesnt run particularly smoothly on my pc so I lowered the resolution and that helped fairly.  The concept is amazing and is very enjoyable to play if you put the hours in and get far into the game. This is definitely a game to have a friend or two playing with you as it quite difficult to get the resources and fight off players on your own. However, you do meet people in the game that are friendly and can help you and even join your guild or join theirs. The combat was an attempt to make it realistic which didnt really work so it makes it hard to kill other players.  Pros: Good Fun With Friends  Ok Building  Lots To Craft  Hours of fun  Roleplay  Cons: Combat  Better Players Hunting You  Takes Time  Not A Solo Game  Hackers  Glitches  4/5",

You want things to be realistic but not the point were you are minning more then you are building. Example I had 3,000 stone and could only make 120 cobblestone. It would be good if they made the stone worth more or took less to build. Second I like that it is easy to add people to your guild but Also would think that it would be a good Idea if they added building persmisons. that way a friend can help you build with out giving up his or her land. That would be more realistic. I like the building how you can click and drag and it will build. I also like how you can hunt. amoung other things. I would recommend this game but also would say that it needs work in some areas.",

            "review_text": "TLDR: Its a great game with some ups and downs, 7/10.   I started playing this game in Alpha 14, I had loads of fun when I first joined, met some   new people, built some stuff, and died a few times, it was a good time. I got absolutely addicted to  this game, but eventually, stopped playing for a while, like any other game, then came back to it.  The PvP system is mediocre at best. When you should have hit someone, but then they take no   damage, then spawning 7 feet away, then taking 5 hits, then dying. It happens way too much.  I feel like the lag compensation is pretty bad for this, especially while fighting. The clunky swords   and shields makes it difficult to get a god swing on someone. The building system in this game is   fantastic, 10/10. Sometimes, my framerate goes down way too far, below anything that I know my   system can handle, but its ok. I really enjoyed the layout of the map, with everything being close enough to take a quick run over to it, but with StormWall, I feel like you need to prepare your self like you are going to take a 30 mile hike, just to get to a couple resources, not my style. The shield and iron star mace combo in this game is absolutely broken. Seriously, that combo + the terrible lag, its just a one sided battle if you go up against it. But other than that, this game is great, with a variety of different ways to play it. Its great. 7/10.",

            "review_text": "First of all, before you buy this game, you'll sieve through the reviews or that you may have noticed that the game has a high number of mixed reviews. The game is unfinished but the remaining developers are slowly adding and fixing things. But the one thing you'll need to accept is that it's personal preference when it comes to getting the game. I love the game, I've played it for hours on end just building and refining my poor PvP skills! I own a server now [The Atlas] (which myself and my lovely admin look after very nicely) and have a few plugins to make it a little more exciting and fun.  It's your bog standed survival PvP game - you'll find the a******s who go around destroying and raiding bases, you'll get hackers, but slowly they've been weened out; you'll be minding your own business when someone just starts hacking at your shins. But that's your standard PvP game and doesn't that make it fun? Of course it does! And I personally hate PvP games because I'm sickly competitive sometimes!  The game has a lot of promise if all goes well with the developers continuing to update it in their own time. It's great fun, it's simple, can be frustrating and a little boring at times, but honestly it's great fun. The graphics aren't amazing, but they're dynamic. Animations are questionable, but the dancing animations would put any popstar to shame - just make sure you do it in the nude with a big grin on thy face. The fighting mechanics are good: it's always satisfying when you can hack off your enemy's (or friend's!) limbs off, or perhaps drag them to your dungeon. The building mechanics is highly reminiscent of Minecraft, since you get blocks, ramps, corner blocks, stairs - some people have built some amazing bases - I myself went a bit mental with making towers using Minecraft blueprints.  To conclude, with hopes that the devleopers will continue to update the game, it'll eventually be a lot smoother and have more content. If you want something a little simpler than Rust et al., this is a good start. If you've got Rust et al. and you want a change of scenery, get this game. It's plain simple fun.  The bottomline is, get this game on personal preference - I saw this game had mixed reviews, but I saw some gameplay from some Youtubers and thought I'd give it a go. Turns out it's pure simple fun and I love it.",

E.G. The chinese bow or using diamond for somthing more than just lockpicks I think this game has great potential. Although you may not want to buy this if you are intending to play this with a group of 2 or less because you will get bored. I suggest 4+ players should do you just fine :D (But that is the same with all open world surivial games). The game is a fresh idea on a popular genre and the graphics are that of finely polished game. However thier WILL be bugs. Most of these negative reviews are from back before the game was offically releaced. Game company's do this because they can get effective bug reports from real players but also work with the players to create a game both of them would like. Please remember that this is my opinion and other people have every right to say whatever they want. All I can say is look up some gameplay of this game and decide if you want to buy this. In my opinion this was the best investment I have made in a while.  P.S I do stand strong on the developers adding new items as to decrease the chance of the game getting stale.

The concept is bad, but could be better if they actually tried. Not much thought process in terms of gameplay and execution.  Reign of Kings has been released for going on a year now and in its current state is still an Early Access title. My 1 hour playtime is more than enough to see how Codehatch works. Yes, let's not forget the amateur development team is Codehatch. Remember when they release Starforge unfinished and abandoned Starforge afterwards? I still remember. Codehatch made me realize that I don't need to be so trusting with Early Access titles, and I thank them for being nothing but scam artists. You might ask, 'Then why are you here buying another one of their games?' - Well, this game is dirt cheap, so dirt cheap it is worth $4 or less on certain websites, not $19. Still trying to think of reasons why Reign of Kings is $19 when this game is worth no more than $6~$9 in its current state. Not sure who would pay full price for Reign of Kings in the first place, not me!  My first impressions when first logging in is my character (camera) uncontrollably started spinning. I'm sitting here like, 'what?'. So I searched to see if anyone else had the same issue and they did. Apparently having a controller plugged in will cause this and you have to unplug it for it to stop. Ultimately that is no solution if you didn't want to unplug your controller.  After I had to be forced to unplug my controller, I joined the same server with my friend. We were farming and all of a sudden some laggy chinese guy on a US server started coming after us fully geared. He killed us both. After that incident he started camping, killed my friend again whilst I'm avoiding him. Don't forget we're new with no gear. Afterwards my friend gets stuck, and with no way in becoming unstuck he had to be forced offline and we haven't played since then.  During that time I found out that gathering, you start off with a crappy axe to gather wood (and other resources), but gathering other things is basically running around pressing the pick-up action button. Items like clay, wood and other certain resources have to be gathered with a tool (I never tried unarmed). Crafting is just a big scroll menu with categories and there's no search bar in the said crafting menu (if there is I missed it).  I honestly never got to try the 'fun stuff' since we could never get that far. We'd either be killed by a higher tier player and camped, become stuck with no way in getting unstuck (unless we were killed) or we cannot find certain resources because they are very scarce for some reason. Yes, we could go on servers with 0 players, but what's the point? It is a multiplayer game and a pretty dead one.   Overall",

We took a hour break and then logged in and everything was gone, every single Tier 5 block. Even if you remove a land claim, T5 blocks take a long time to remove one by one. This base was massive and it would have taken days, but this base was wiped out in minutes. There are no admins to address this issue, and if you are not Chinese don't expect them to play fair with you. IE: Your name is not writtin in chinese or binary then they will teleport to you merc you and then wipe your base with ZERO intervention. Their EAC anti-cheat is garbage.

The game itself isn;t too bad, its mostly the people who are the cause of the distress. hackers who take your ♥♥♥♥ away, or the Asians that have oddly come in a rush and can hardly speak a dime of english. People of steam, this isn;t a bad game, it just has some ♥♥♥♥ people using the bugs, hacks, and poor managment at the time to ♥♥♥♥ others over. Communtiy servers seem to have the best servers, do not go on official as you will be raided quickler or KOSed anytime soneone walks up to you.  Ive enjoyed servers that inculde mods, no KOS , and sometimes RP. the game itself is good if there is someone around making sure people follow the rules, and kicks any of those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who would rather be naked and attack you on sight till they win, then really play the game.   still there are lots of pros and cons in this game, so i give the community servers a 7/10 and the offical servers a 2/10 rating.   (( edit )) Well ive come back to change my mind, as of a few months ago the dev team has said that they were not be adding anything else to the game aside bug fixes and this game feels no way near done, so this game is a lost cause now. I had hours of fun in this game but i was on the mind set it would only get better and better. but hardly anything has changed, the npcs (( which are hardly any )) are to few, and there is no real end game content.

            "review_text": "I actually really enjoy this game, but it's gotten worse over recent patches. Stuff does feel really clunky, it's not well optimized for lower systems, and variety of content is admittedly kind of small; a larger crafting menu would do well. Honestly, the game's golden age was a few patches ago on community servers where hackers were taken care of by admins. Now, it's generally laggier with not really anything new of interest.  (original review recommended this game, but on second thought, I can't really recognize the game on it's own merits, as I don't think the same enjoyment I initally had is so easy to come by now)  I personally enjoyed a lot of this game. I met a good group of people that I played on servers with, and experienced what this game tries to do. I say I recommend in that if I were to speak to my past self before buying this game, I would still say it was a worthwhile purchase. Now, some games appeal to some people and not to everyone; our variety of interests is a beautiful element of humanity, but it does mean that maybe not everyone will enjoy this game or have the same experience as me. With that in mind, read on.  Survival games seem to be the trend nowadays, and there are a lot to choose from; from what I gather, this started with the popular Arma II modification, DayZ. The Zombies were the official threat, but the real meta of danger lay within the other players. Since then, we've seen a lot of spins on this open-world survival drama. Other notable entries include Rust, which appears to be a heavy influence on this game. From what I know of both, this game is actually extremely similar except with the setting being medieval and opting for swords and bows instead of guns.  A major element of this game, for better or for worse, is the player base. People in real life can be terrible, impossible to work with. Others are friendly and approachable. I've met both types here, and seen people fall everywhere on the spectrum. I enjoy the thrill of needing to be careful around other people, figuring out what alliances you can make but also those you should avoid, and existing with something less predictable yet more authentic than a computer-controlled antagonist. I've been a part of some of the emergent intrigue that can happen on community servers, and it proved a very enjoyable experience.  If there were a single mindset I would say you should take to this game, it is that you should imagine yourself as an NPC in a Bethesda game (such as Skyrim, Fallout 3/4, etc.). Making yourself a useful asset to people is less likely to get yourself killed, but there will always be the crazies who attack you anyways and the friendly people who wouldn't kill you no matter what. Everyone else is one of these people too; how do you interact with them?  That brings me to another significant factor on this recommendation; server types. Community servers are privately owned, and some have active admins while others don't. This is also in conjunction with the various degrees of rules you might see; some servers are devoted to PVP, others completely discourage it, with a vast majority lying somewhere in between. Official Servers, however, are very much left on their own. Expect a grittier experience on these.  There are also a lot of vocal people for and against the game. Specifically, many naysayers like to refer to the developer's last game, Starforge. From what I understand, Starforge is one of the most disappointing games to go through the steam release process, with no evidence suggesting it has anything redeeming to it. From my experience, though, the developers learned; or at least, did not repeat their mistake. I've had fun playing the game. Any multiplayer online game will need maitenance, and this game will hopefully recieve that.  TLDR: Think Chivalry combat in Rust. Hacking problems have been mostly fixed. It's a fun game, but extremely situational. The 'not recommended' is for the fact that I don't know if we'll see an update.",
