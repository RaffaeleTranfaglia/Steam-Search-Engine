            "review_text": "Well this is a very flawed game. First of it's not very hard due to way to many health kits and low damging enemies. It's very repetitive, you'll be shooting the same unispiring green robots on the same looking cyan corridors over and over again.  One thing I simply cannot understand is that all the weapons (also very similar to each other) use the same kind of ammo, but when you collect ammo boxes it only loads the current gun, not your ammo pool. Wouldn't it be better if each gun had it's own ammo? Finally the game whants you to collect a certain amount of energy to complete it, but it never gives you an estimate of how much is needed or how much do you have. Why am I recomending this game again?.... Oh yeah, the soundtrack is surprisingaly good, with a catchy retro tune, even if it starts to get repetitive soon. I quite like the style and the colour pallete of the game, felling like a retro cyber-punk. It's also very cheap when it's on sale, and if you don't like just play it for a little while and then refund it. Or get Intrude, another retro FPS made in 2016 that's way better than this one.",
