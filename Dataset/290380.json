            "review_text": "Excercise your critical thinking skills in this fun puzzle game. With its simplistic design and musical sound effects I found it quite enjoyable and would highly recommend it. The concept is simple. Balls are shot from an opening and you must place angles and or portals to get it to open doors and get them to the end. The difficulty is you must put them in the proper spot at the proper time to achieve your goal.   It is a great game for all ages however those under ten may need help to finish it unless they are unusually patient. A great game to play with your children though. Get their little problem solving wheels turning! The game has some difficult levels but not overly so in my opinion. I did however cheat on one of the bonus levels and look for the answer elsewhere.   There are a number of free levels for download in the steam workshop as well. Just subscribe to them and they will be downloaded the next time you start the game.   I did not find any bugs and was not able to complete any level using less than the full complement of pieces provided. Note: This is edited because I could not find the level editor. I did find the level editor it is in your steam files.  In my opinon it would be worth the full price of $4.99 or even better to purchase it on sale! However I prefer to let the gamer decide how much a game is worth as it is a subjective matter. Hope this review helped.   Enjoy your Gaming!",

            "review_text": "A simple projectile deflection puzzler with nicely integrated music. Micron is advertised as a 'fusion of puzzle and rhythm gameplay', but the rhythm portion of the claim doesn't really hold water. At no point does the player have to keep up to any kind of a rhythm to solve any of the puzzles - While a couple of levels do require reasonably nimble fingers, the 'rhythm' is just incidental music created by the sounds of the projectiles hitting various targets.  The game has a nice, laidback feel and very clear, simple graphics. The 60-ish levels don't really ever become frustrating, and can all be solved in a reasonable amount of time. In fact, clearing the game 100% only took me a couple of hours. If you're looking for a mellow diversion for a few hours, this might fit the bill. Micron didn't really impress me in any singular aspect, but sometimes just a solid execution can be enough.",

Initial levels are easy and intuitive, last ones make you spend some time to get how they works and are a little bit challenging.  it's a 3/4 hours game, perfect to waste time and/or get cards/achievements/badges  EDIT: i'm stupid, there are no cards and badges, at least achievements icons look cute",

Sometimes, I wanted to kick myself after solving a level and realizing that the solution should have been obvious. You have to take several different approaches to reach the answer sometimes, I guess. Anyway, this game is good to get the ol' brain working a bit. I'm having fun with it.",

Honestly, my only complaint is that I don't get to listen to the music long enough for the shorter/simpler levels.  Definitely worth the investment.",
