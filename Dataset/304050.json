            "review_text": "The dev team has got to be one of the most pants-embedded-in-skull backwards i've ever seen in terms of relating to their player base. If you're not one of the VIP-lister big names, you might as well not exist. If you are one of them, prepare to have the game rebalanced around your experience and given lavish rewards constantly just for being teacher's pet. I'm not exaggerating on this one - they recently as of the time of writing (05/01/2016) introduced Contests, where whoever has the most score in X category gets some pretty good prizes at the end of the week. Sounds fun? Well too bad this dev team are like fun mosquitos, because they managed to royally heck it up - mastery is a static statistic that can only possibly go up and catalogues how much stuff you've collected in the game. So those who already have everything get even more stuff, and those who are starting out get the finger. On that statement, i'm once again not exaggerating - one of the first weekly contests was akin to 'how many dungeons can you clear'. This resulted in hordes of high-end players descending upon the lowest level worlds like a plague of jackass locusts and cleared all the dungeons in a crazed gluttonous frenzy that'd make the zerg themselves soil their carapace. Why is this bad? Because the new players couldn't get any levelling up done because all the dungeons had been one-shot by the high end turd brigade.  Now I know, you could put this one more on the community than the devs themselves. However, I don't believe for one second nobody internally didn't forsee this happening. Are you seriously going to tell me that a dev team which as far as i've seen consists of at least seven people (most likely quite a few more) didn't confer among themselves and think 'Hey, we should probably put some kind of limit on this!'? What are they paying these nimrods in, pocket lint?  You may be noticing a trend here - that new players get the shaft a lot, and that I use the phrase 'i'm not exaggerating' a lot. I'm having to throw in these disclaimers because as I type this myself there's still some itching, tickling feeling somewhere buried deep in my brain that tells me 'Come on, no one can possibly develop something this stupid.'. Oh they can. They can. Did I recall the nerfs to a whole bunch of stuff which has made the game harder than ever for new players to get into, at the profit of the highest-end dev suckup players? Let's list a few!  - Classes, formerly available for an ingame currency you get a small daily stipend of, are now pay-only. You can get five or so for free by jumping through some various hoops, but once you've done that you have to open your wallet and bend over, or leave. This wouldn't be so bad if some classes weren't outright gimped, so it's entirely possible for a new player to make five crappy picks and then just be stuck.  - Dragons, a form of personal progression that grant account-wide power, have been made harder and harder to get. Dragon coins, the ingame currency you need to unlock them, have been made untradeable so you've got to accumulate 300 per dragon all by your lonesome. How do you get them? Hourly challenges, where you've got 20 minutes to clear X amount of dungeons in a specific area... which you get bonuses for if you're in a high level world, and if you're using one of two classes randomly picked from all the currently existing classes. See how that's a problem when you're low level and don't have many classes unlocked? Well unlock all classes, and you ca- oh. Oh dear.  - Content expansions. The new expansion Mantle of Power just came out as of the time of writing, and jesu cristo crocodrillo. I'll get to the myriad of inherent problems with that in a moment. How does it affect new players? It affects them negatively because a bunch of options have been 're-balanced' (read: nerfed into oblivion) around the new high-end content. The knock on effects of this on new players seem to have been totally ignored - the players who already have few options other than 'grind more' and 'git gud'. Double damage emblems which grant you a buff that actually makes you able to kill stuff in a reasonable timeframe got nerfed twice - first the ingame currency cost was raised, and then it got reduced to lasting something like 3 seconds, down from around 7 or 8. Why? Well, because **** YOU, THAT'S WHY. BUY MORE OF OUR STUFF.  That's just three pointers. I could go on all day, which you're probably feeling like I have already at this point, though in all honesty spending an equal amount of time reading this or playing Trove seems like you'd feel more accomplished after reading this.  Now as I said, the new expansion really shows off how creative the dev teams are. A lot of end game players were complaining that all they really had to do once they got there was grind grind grind. Don't worry, Avarem and his team have you covered! With the new themed elemental worlds to explore, you can do the following: - Grind the same dungeons as before BUT ON THE SEA! - Grind the same dungeons as before BUT IN LAVA! - Grind the same dungeons as before BUT IN THE SKY! - Fight a zerg rush of boss monsters for a randomized prize that you can only get out of a chest if you brought a key that you can only get randomly from a box that randomly drops, the prize being a gem that you need to level up BUT there's a random chance of failing to level up and smashing the gem into a million bits but don't worry there's an item in our cash shop that can repair the gem and then you can break it again because you had the audacity to try and make progress but don't worry, BEND OVER PEASANT, IT'S WALLET TIME.  Then, there's gems. Ohhhhh boy. Okay. This one's going to take a bit of explaining for the layman's benefit, but at this point you've already read the 500 meters, why not go for the reading marathon? Reading is good for you! So pre-release in Trove the gear system was.. not great. Gear could only be improved so far, so it was possible to get a 'bad drop' which would have terrible stats you don't want and you'd be stuck with it unless you want to go find some other thing. If it was a high level drop with bad stats? Too bad for you, grind more. This was rather unpopular and was eventually replaced with the current system where any piece of gear can be forged all the way up from the lowest to the highest quality and you could re-roll the random stats. Get a cool-looking sword with bad stats on it? No problem, just get some crafting materials to muck with it a bit until you've got the stats you want on it and you're good.  Now gems, the new 'power yourself up' thing comes out... and they run off the old gear system they scrapped that nobody liked. What. Not only that, but you can't see all the stats on them from the get-go. You have to upgrade them at a not-at-all cheap cost (which can fail and smash the gem as previously stated), at which point you can despair at your wizard being equipped with a physical damage gem ALL ALONG, that you need to pay to remove from the slot. Doublewhat. I despair to think anyone in the dev team thought they were being clever with this. Folks didn't like it once, they ain't gonna like it a second time with a bit of window dressing on it, genius!  Wow, i've actually hit the character limit on reviews. Weird. Closing word: I looked up the lead dev's development history. He has worked exclusively on flops, and it shows here. This game had potential, but not with this jerkoff leading the show. Burn the fields, salt the earth, start over - there's not going to be any good gaming to be found here until Trion does that.  Also note the dev response doesn't really address anything set forth here. Good job!",

A few of the people who manage Trove are very rude, greedy and not above lying to their playerbase to satisfy their own agenda.  I personally have seen management lie to thousands of people to make themselves look like the innocent people on a number of occasions, impossible to trust a company without morals.  I had to speak to 6 people to try and resolve a simple problem and in the end I spoke to the CEO who was rude, lied to me and even swore in his emails to me.  This game used to be good but now it's a solid 0/10, don't waste your time.  Btw, if you're going to comment something incredibly stupid before reading my entire review and realising that I've played this game for hundreds of days through the Glyph launcher which doesn't add hours to Steam then I'll just delete your comment as it's irrelevant.",

Briefly summing up my previous negative review:  This game is:  1) WONDERFUL when you try it the first time, the colors will instantly mesmerize you. So will the game and it's 'nice' rewards you get when you achieve the first few levels.  But then, you think Pokemon go's one big grind? You think levelling up to level 30 on lol is one big grind? You think that levelling up to rank 2 to play matchmaking on csgo is one big grind?  Boy you're in for a treat.  Mastering to level 300 - in this game. That's a ♥♥♥♥ing grind.  and check the market. Look at the game. Does it look like a hardcore action game to you?  No. It's a kids game.  Trionworlds. Thieves, scoundrels and dirty moneymakers.  Sure, every company's aim to make money. But these guys?  'Here's a package that's 50$ to get you one pixelated dragon that gains you 1 'mastery' - level. and some chests where the rng's so ♥♥♥♥ you're going to get the 5$ package's items.'  Oh, did I mention it's a kids game?  This game's cancer, but it used to be amazing. Trionworlds created a beautiful child only to raise it into a disgusting person.  No other way to say it!

            "review_text": "Now as you can see I have played this game for 58 hours, so thats nearly 2 and a half days of my life that I invested in this game, It was the perfect storm of fetures that would attract most peoples attention such as an endless dungeon crawl that can be done with strangers and friends alike, a Diablo style dungeon crawl aswel, a basic yet good building system that allows you to build in greifer proof plots dotted around the landscape, a rather useful yet dull crafting system which seemed to be 'mix X with Y and try to get the highest stats' and a wide array of classes to play as ranger from classic rpg classes such as Knighs, Rangers and Wizards going all the way to Cyborg Ninjas, Candy Barbarians and even badass Dragon Pyromancers and plenty of cosmetic items that can be use as skins for better yet uglier items. So me and my friends decided to give it a go and befor we knew it we where playing in high Uber difficuties and clearing shadow dungeons by our selves, then we stopped playing for a while and came back only to realize that all the items which we could have easily bought with the mass amounts of cubits wher made that you could only buy them with the premium currency, and then the devs make weak responses to critisism like 'you can still find the items ingame, the currency isfor people who dont have the time' which is a horrible excuse made by plenty of these 'free 2 play' devs who dont know how to implement their premium currency right, DE does it right by making the items obtainable by both means in Warframe and easily too. So play this if you feel like it I just know that anyone who understands f2p games would understand the intising updates, but the ultimate backstab once the devs have a high enough fan base and feel like they can get away with anything",

It was nice that there wasnt too much grinding, it was great and intuitive that your items were what mostly depended on your power and level, not just exp. Let me now tell you what RUINED this once new and explosive game. (BTW if you are a new player I DO NOT RECOMMEND this game. Maybe play it for the experience because when you get to at least u4 and gem RNG you'll want to end your life.)   PVP  Holy guacamole dont even get me started on Class Gem Pirate Captain and darn tooting Ice Sage with instant ability cooldown. At first, I much enjoyed ruining peoples lives as an ice sage. I thought it was hilarious. Then I came across teams with 2-3 ice sages and wanted to end my futile existance. I've quit PVP because of one class. I dont find it fun to enrage people with freezing anymore because I now know what it's like to be on the butt end. Sorry to all whom I froze because I lost all chill (pun intended) when it happened to me.  GEMS and POWER RANK  Want to know how to increase power rank or get to u9? The answer is gems. It used to be farming a bit and upgrading gear, but now your shadow 5 and radiant gear is barely HALF of your Power Rank. This makes me sad. What's even worse is that the RNG on gems is totally freaking ridiculous. A shadow gem (better than relic/resplendant) can have MUCH WORSE stats than a Relic/Resplendant can. Sure, it MIGHT (that is a very very unassured might) have better Power Rank, but still, you'll have to GRIND and GRIND for Gem Dust to upgrade gems just so you can upgrade more to get a tiny bit more Power Rank. This game didnt used to be grinding. It was only softcore farming. RIP all players trying to get over 1200 PR in a short time.  NEW PLAYERS  There arent any. If you're a new player then congrats. You looked at this game and probably said 'This looks like a cute little softcore RPG! I'll try it out!'. I'm so sorry pal. Trove is now a HARDCORE GRINDING RPG THAT ONLY LOOKS CUTE. ON THE INSIDE TRION IS SECRETLY THE GOSH DARN ILLUMINATI (whose servers are on Pluto btw. Trion is a Plutonian name is you didnt know) AND THEY WANT YOU TO PLAY AND PAY AND SPEND ALL YOUR CASH ON GEMS SO YOU CAN HOPE YOU GET GOOD ONES BUT THEN DONT AND HAVE TO PAY TO WIN ALL OVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!   Dear Trion, Dude. What the hoot.  P.S. You've taken a good juicy pinapple of a game, eaten it and then ♥♥♥♥ it out and left it to rot. Tbh, you're almost as bad a Kabam (My lord that was harsh...)

            "review_text": "Trove isn't bad per se, it just gets boring and repetitive really fast.  Yes, it's quirky, humorous, colorful &amp; generally oozing a positive vibe. Yes, there is strong community aspect &amp; some user created content can be awe inspiring. Yes, there are certain really nice game mechanics, like for example your cornerstone - a house of your own that you build &amp; that you can place &amp; relocate everywhere you want with a single button press. Also the music can be dreamy (Neon City &lt;3).  Basically it's good to goof around for a bit, log in daily for a short while and log off. But as far as progression goes it requires a lot of time and repetition. Whether it's crafting, building, unlocking new classes or raising your mastery level - it all takes insane amounts of mats/currency &amp; grind.   Sure the maps and dungeons are randomly generated. Sure, the dungeon design is quite fresh and can be very imaginative (or confusing ;). Sure, there are plenty of funny classes to choose from. But most dungeons are short (find boss, kill boss, take loot, get out) and sooner rather than later you learn all the design patterns and the novelty that came with it wears off (especially when you need to farm bajilion of them). Classes are very basic: main attacks - left click &amp; right click, and 2 additional skills only. And they also take long to unlock, so if you happen to pick one that doesn't suit you, you'll struggle on your way to unlocking the next. And even if you pick a fun one, after a while you'll get bored with it, because there is only one way to play a certain class, and you'll be repeating the same combat pattern over and over.  Crafting is done via stations. Each station contains a list of items/things/portals/mounts/stuff you can make. To be able to craft other things, you need to craft other stations. You end up with several of them placed in your cornerstone and have to remember which allows you to make what (or go through them &amp; all the lists top to bottom, every single time you're trying to make a specific item). Not the most elegant of solutions. Anyway, for some things you'll need hundreds (if not thousands) of materials, that you can obtain by harvesting in the world (right click in build mode, that you can switch to anytime) or by killing stuff, completing dungeons and disassembling loot in via the loot collector. Also some crafting branches you have to level up by making hundreds of items, before you're allowed to make anything decent.   Building requires a lot of blocks as well (especially larger guild projects), but actually the building part is the least obnoxious aspect of Trove and doesn't take any extra effort than say Minecraft.  Because of all the things mentioned above you'll find yourself either running around &amp; right clicking (=collecting) materials from the game world for prolonged periods of time or doing those fast dungeons ad infinitum. Once in a while you'll place your cornerstone in order to maybe craft or build something, just to be reminded of how much stuff you still need to obtain.  Like I said, Trove is good to log in once in a while, play around &amp; log out (especially if you don't care about achieving anything specific). It's a pretty neat time waster if you have no games to play or just don't feel like doing anything else. Unfortunately I have a whole backlog of games I'd rather be playing over this and I'm not blessed with overabundance of time to kill, so I won't be playing Trove anymore.",

Pros: Fun engaging combat Many weapons,armor,and various other things to collect. Multiple biomes with unique bosses.  Cons: Dispite it saying free,this is a pay2win game through and through. With this most recent update (2/9/2016) they've made it so that in order to access areas of the game,you need to grind weeks if not months into obtaining items that all usually have the same stats so this means obtaining useless trash in large quantitites just to advance in the game. This makes progressing incredibly tedious and incredibly time consuming with the only reward being a couple ticks of points. A recent update has made changing classes cost real money. You like that barbarian class? I hope you have a fat wallet. They've made obtaining classes only obtainable through real money and a in game marketplace. Just yesterday I was able to unlock any class with little effort but due to them locking off our ability to unlock classes this way you're either forced to spend real money or buy incredibly overprice and inflated items that you might as well just spend real money on because they're ridiculously expensive.  Game cliant crashes all the time,bugs plague the game,clipping through walls and floors is normal,huge amounts of lag on monster computers is pretty normal too.

I said the game was ok because everything that needed premium currency(credits) to buy could have been bought on the community market of the game for a somewhat fair price. Class coins were available for 20,000 flux (non-premium currency?) which might seem like a lot, but it isn't. It's not too hard to farm 20k flux if you know what you're doing. I used to craft a mount by growing and harvesting the required plants. It sold for about 4000-8000 flux and I could make two of those a day. Also doing the hourly events (forgot what they are called haven't played in a while) and beating the shadow tower gave a lot items which can be turned into flux.  I saw the price of class coins in the market double during my 190 hours in the game. They were going for 40k however, I was still able to farm the required amount, it just took twice as long. It wasn't a deal breaker. Then I got tired of the game and quit playing for a few months because it got kind of boring. Too much grinding later on in the game.  I logged in after a few months and now the class coin is worth 200,000 flux! That is ridiculous! I'd be better off buying the classes from the store for over 1000 credits which is at least $10. It's $10 only if you buy the credits seprately. No one playing the game will recommend that though, because the packs, which costs more, is a much better deal.  That is just one problem with the game. As other reviews have mentioned, the grinding is terrible. Especially late game when you need the absolute best gear to survive. Getting the best gear with the best stats for your class is a gamble! I haven't played in a while so I can't explain that part very well but the other reviewers have.  This is a great game if you don't mind spending a lot of money on it. Crafting is fun. Building your own house is fun. Fighting bosses with your friends is fun. Stupid amounts of grinding is not.",

            "review_text": "Being a breath of fresh air in the voxel style of games, Trove varies from it's similar titles in ways that are appeasing to the eye and the community. The first of it's kind aside from Cube World, Trove is a massive RPG that allows you the freedom to customize the way you play, the way your character looks, and your all-around experience of the game. Trove has improved greatly since its early days in Closed Beta. The course of the game is far more easy to understand, as you now have objectives pointing you in the direction of your journey.  One of the best parts of Trove is that it is not Cash Shop heavy, and most things can be bought with the in-game currency that is given to you by killing enemys completing quests. Mounts can be found as loot throughout the game, but can also be bought at a reasonable price. Companions, which are pets that will follow you around and attack enemies with you, can be found in the game as loot as well, but you can also buy them in the cash shop.  Trion Worlds did a great job on Trove's 'guild' mechanic. Instead of joining a guild full of players, you can join something called a 'Club', which has it's own world and chat for you and your friends to have fun with.  Trove's character customization is also one that deserves to be a lesson to other MMORPG's. You don't have to pay premium OR in-game currency to change the way your character looks. So if you don't like your character's appearance, or you simply want to try something new, it is at no cost to you whatsoever.  The community is a huge part of the Trove world. Hats and masks for you to wear are mostly made by the community themselves, which can be picked up. Credit is of course given to the person who made the face, and they come up with some pretty creative names for the items.  If you don't like the way your class plays out, or you simply just want to try your hand at a different class, don't worry. You can pay premium or in-game currency to change your class. Don't like the way the Neon Ninja looks, and want to try your hand at another one, the choice is yours for a small price.  Do I recommend this game? Of course, it's a great game with an ever-evolving community with very active developers who have been very calm during this hectic launch.  I give it a 9/10",

            "review_text": "I try to keep it short.  This review comes from a maxed out player, who began shortly after the beta was finished. I had nearly anything archieved (Mounts, Dragon, Allies, Styles, Costumes) and had the best Equipment aswell as the money to buy everything i wanted. (I have WAY more hours on the Glyph launcher.)  I loved this game, I really did.  There was no marketplace so it was nice to trade. You were able to archieve things in a reasonable time. The classes were able to be bought with currecncy you gained for logging in daily, which I think was a fair deal. The only thing you needed to pay for with real money was (like in many other games) cosmetics ,things which made things easier for you and some premium mounts which were avaible also from time to time for free-players.  I played this game without spending any penny and in the end i don´t regret. The greedy dudes from Trion rolled out like 3 patches which totally destroyed the game, its currency and they lost many of their members.  Let me briefly give you an insight of what they did:  -There are 12 Classes   earlier: all avaible after some period of time  now: 5 Classes for free rest needs to be bought with real money (or traded via Ingame-Market, but still needs to be bought from someone). -Added a Power-Level which made it ridiculous hard for newbies to get a foot on the endgame content. -Dragons which were able to be 'collected' durring a specific time and which have a serious impact on you Power-Level were now hidden behind a freaking hard grind time earlier: 1 Dragon like 1-2 Weeks of time needed the additional earning could be sold to other players which were to lazy to do the missions now: 1 Dragon like 8 Weeks of time needed and less additional stuff gained to sell (which is bad for economy) Quote: 'New, limited time, $100 Credit Pack is now on the store. This pack contains $100 worth of Credits and a bonus tradable Golden Lunar New Year Egg, which immediately hatches Selene, the Celestial Storm, with no additional materials required!' -Thats the way grind it or buy it  This act of total contempt of the community made me giveaway all of my stuff, say goodbye to everyone i had known in this game, uninstall the game and write trion what i thought about the changes. Unfortunately they didnt care and kept going with this monkey business.   My conclusion:  If you are able to get a time travel machine i totally recommend you to play the game until there will be a patch name 'Monkey Business'. If you are a ULTRA tryhard and you like masochistical grinding this game is woth a try. But if you like a nice ballenced, fair F2P game with kind devs this game is the wrong attempt. ~ Love you Trion :*, never see you again ",

You can ask pretty much anything in the global chat, or certain 'groups' you can join, and you'll get a response really quickly. I'd recommend watching some streamers and see what their requirements are of joining their group. Usually very big groups with helpful people. -Easy to play with friends, you can use your friends list to teleport to your friends easily. Cooldown time can be annoying, but is necessary. -The interactiveness in general is AMAZING! Like you can be typing while loading a new map/area, and when the map loads, your chat is still there. Some games just close your chat which can be very annoying. Also, you can have your inventory open with chat, so you can transfer names of objects easily. Overall, very interactive interface. -Unique 3 tier leveling system, base level, armour level, and mastery level. Very cool system. -A lot of different classes with different play styles and skills. Allows for anyone to find the class that best fits them. -Forums where they post updates and reasons behind downtime and what not. Also posts when the servers are back up. -A bunch of streamers, where you can win giveaways and what not. Good for starting players, and more experienced players. Can never say no to giveaways! -Trove is very appreciative of any content creators. Anyone who designs an object gets like 200 copies of that object, and can give them away or make a ton of oney off of it. Regardless, really nice of Trion Worlds for doing that.  There are a lot more things, I just don't want to keep on writing. Overall, great game. Now, for some cons.  CONS: -Downtime downtime downtime... so much of it. You really need to be patient with this game. They've had downtimes spaning 5 minutes, and downtimes spanning a full day. You never know, they might say its a 2 hour maintenance, but it takes 5 hours. It's very annoying, but worth it for the quality of the game. -Can be long wait times to join a new world/map. Teleporting times can also take awhile. -Game has froze/crashed for me a few times.  Again, there are obviously more cons to list, but again don't want to list all of them. These are just the most noticiable one.  With everything I mentioned above, it is still obvious that this is a great game, and therefore has earned my recommendation for this game.

There are multiple classes, all in which, you can level up and put gear on. Only problem is those classes cost money now. You can only get free classes when you've gotten a certain point into the game. These points are referred to as mastery. You earn mastery by getting things such as weapons, dragons, mounts, and classes. Problem is. All of those things cost cold hard cash. Mounts can be bought or crafted. Crafting takes mastery, mastery takes money. Want a dragon? Spend money. Want a costume for the class you just bought for 10 dollars? Spend 20 dollars. Wish to get to a point in the game where you are having fun all the time? Not a chance. This game has some of the least satisfying gameplay you might ever see. Kill monsters, get loot. Fun the first 1000 times. If you had gotten this game in December of 2015. I'm pretty much an end game player at this point. Got the second best gear, because I didn't have to pay to get it. Got the coolest mounts and dragons, a class I love and friends I can play with. All these things simply do not make up for the pay to win garbage I sat through for 2 months playing.   I do fully respect Trion for making a game pay to win, though. In the end, a company has to make money, it all boils down to that. It's just a shame to see a promising game go down the drain.

You can choose to be a sword wielding tank, a damage heavy character or a spell-toting dragon.

After some alpha/beta time it went officially full release and it's popularity got through the roof. It has many factors which will keep many players stay late at night (to get those wings).  You would think that after getting those your world will be completely different, wrong mate, it will be completely same so stop f*cking begging for wings it's short process of getting them.Now the next natural part, by the games tutorial-ish quests it is still learning and there is some stuff to understand about the specific part of the quest ''Collect radiant shards'' do people know why it precisely says ''Better get some wings first'' ? Well many don't, to put it simply it means GET THOSE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ WINGS BEFORE GOING THERE. Why the hell they would said it otherwise ? I agree that getting the portal is really long process, but to get it you need to collect lots of stuff, 1 of them you get by exploring lands a lot, another is through gardening which gets you closer to mastery lvl where you get wings (see how it all fits together ?) and at last you will also have you mighty hero who is at least a bit ready for everything in there (not much atm but hey they're adding stuff no hate here). Next in line is something which doesn't makes sense because it's one of first things you probably do so screw that. After that trivia quest you are tasked to get yet higher mastery rank to be eligible for challenges. Ooooh yes THE challenges which were crashing servers for some time, fixed now #thankyoutrion, now it's pretty much lagfest because of pretty heavy load on servers and if you hope you'll do challenge in easiest world, nah don't even try, you'll wait for chunks to load and experience constant rollbacks (hopefully this will be fixed or something dunno man can have dreams).  Did you get enough points in challenge to get your dragon caches ? Did you hoped that you open dragon soul, coin or even penta forged ? Did you ? And did you also get a bit of flux and bunch of eyes after horny chest opening ? Then you are fully capable to call yourself a true Trove player. Now off with ya and go fish dem old boots ye filthy hub huggers.   If someone really cared to read through this which im writing cuz im really bored, then kudos to you mate, just wasted a lot of time you could spend playing or something. Nothing is meant as hate towards developers just pointing few problems if even. Final verdict about the game 8/10 old boots, when servers start to rollback and stuff then it's more like 3/10 but nevermind. This game is really good as rpg, trade simulator, guild-like maker (talking about clubs ofc) and i recommend it to anyone to at least try it. Thanks for reading (or skipping you sissy)",

            "review_text": "There are positives for this game, and there are negatives. However, there are mostly negatives.   For one thing, the client Glyph. For those who haven't downloaded the game yet, the game downloads a client called Glyph, which has you sign up for an account. Don't know why it just doesn't use Steam, but whatever. However, the client has a lot of problems. Sometimes the client will refuse to load, other times the client freezes, and most commonly, the client will be SO SLOW. Another thing about the client is that it downloads updates for Trove. From my experiences, Steam is not the one that downloads it. This causes a serious issue sometimes.  Secondly, the camera, or really the fact that the level design goes against the camera. There are dungeons that you must explore, and in some of them, there are 'trampolines', which will launch you into the air. Some of these are essential to get to the boss. However, some of these are parkour, which is where the issue occurs. The camera will get extremely close to the block above you and will make your character take up the entire screen.  Another problem is the dungeon structure. Some dungeons will have several rooms that are filled with minions and one big room either above ground surrounded by a sphere or below the minion rooms. However, by taking advantage of the abilities that allow you to place and remove blocks (Which along with the world filled with cubes, was definetly not copied from anything mainstream  Cough Couch Minecraft Cough Cough , you can easily reach the boss without fighting any minion, which begs the question: 'Why bother?'  Two of the worst parts of this game are the help it provides you and the  GRINDING  . The game provides you with missions, which go along the lines of 'Use WASD, Go Through A Portal, Craft Something, Craft Something Else, Find Some Minerals, Craft Something Else, Defeat Some Dungeons,  GRIND , Craft Something Else,  GRIND ', and then it suddenly tells you to basically get 3000 currency. The biggest problem with this structure is the grinding. While I understand grinding is present in almost every RPG game, this game makes it so that it takes FOREVER. The other problem is the lack of details for literally everything. 'Oh, do you want to know what the hell gems are used for, or how to join a club, or how to ride your mount? Well, we don't have the budget to tell you how to do that with a linear tutorial, so we are going to wait until you look online or read each and every page from our How To Play section.' I spent so long wondering what gems were used for and how to use them, and I was consistantly taking a long time to beat monsters, and that was because the game never told me how to use gems. Once I equiped one and leveled it up with all 400 GEM DUST I HAD FROM NOT KNOWING HOW TO USE IT, my power rank skyrocketed by 60 levels, and I became unkillable. This leads into the final problem with this game, the overall difficulty. It's extremely easy. Once you know what the hell everything is thanks to online guides, the game becomes more of a chore. All you have to do is hold down the left mouse button and ocassionaly press the right mouse button, 1, 2, and q whenever your screen gets a red border. 'OH THE VARIETY'.   Now, I do realize that I am complaining a lot about a free game, but I will give it some credit, even though it might have been unintentional. This game doesn't require you to buy anything, or at least to my knowledge. Because the game is so easy, the game is not a 'Pay To Win' game, which is something that it does better than a mainstream full price game.  Cough Cough Call Of Duty Black Ops 3 Cough Cough . Overall, the game does have something going for it. If you're into grinding, bad camera angles, or you just want to play an easy game, this is a decent choice. Final Fantasy Fans, you might want to look elsewhere.",

You can mine any block(with the exeptions of dungeons) and then replace that (Yeah it's Minecraft all over again)   While you have to unlock your classes with money (either ingame currency or realy money) you can switch freely between them at any guven point.

            "review_text": "I can see this game being a fun free to play MMO at the start but I couldn't bring myself to actually like this game as I went through it.  Keywords = 'at the start'  Let me explain. This game is just a literal grindfest. You will do nothing but grinding the same dungeons over and over again in a portal to get different levels and get higher tiers of gear. Once you have done all of that, you will proceed to the next portal and do the exact same thing and then after that,you go to the next portal to do the same thing which makes the game really repetitive as well.  To counter the amount of grinding in the game (mostly by a few hours), you will need to pay the developers/publishers real life money which can come in amounts of £7,£15 and to even go as far as £80. Yes, £80 (Which is the highest amount I have seen so far but it probably goes higher than that). So if you want to save a few hours of grinding to get another class or healing item, be prepared to pay quite an amount of money.  There is no endgame. Once you have gotten to the uber 5/6 tier (Whatever the highest is) with the best tier of gear, there is literally nothing else to do after that. Well, there is Shadow Tower which is kinda like raid bosses but you will need to get keys to be able to get into the place which will takes hours/days to get or you can pay them money to get the keys faster. If you do manage to a get key for it, you will probably get killed in like 1 minute if unprepared and then since your key gets consumed, you will have to pay even more money or grind for another day just to get another one.  Customisation. Although this game has tons of weapon skins, hats and masks which make up for the actual lack of character customisation - There is literally nothing but hair, eye colour and skin type. That's it. No gender, no race, nothing.  The community. The community is what you would expect in an MMO like this; rubbish. In some cases of this, I have seen people calling other people anti-homosexual slurs, racial slurs or just general insults just because they don't like a certain part of the game or they don't like another game such as League of Legends and say that Dota 2 is better than it when it's just their opinion. I have also seen people trying to fish but then you have people come in the areas with massive boats to block the other player's sight so they can't tell whether a fish is hooked or not and then the players in boats keep shooting the cannons so the player's fishing can't hear the sound cue for the fish bite either. There are also tons of scammers in this game too which include fishy trades and then being kick straight after, people overpricing items which are probably worth nothing and even getting people to type in referal codes saying it will help them but it will only help the scammer get a mount.  Finally, there are no quests or NPCs... well, there are mobs in this game which don't really count as NPCs. There are no NPCs such as wandering travellers/merchants, no quest givers, nothing but mobs. There is no quest system either so no saving a village or shadowing or anything. Instead they put challenges in the game which can takes hours to complete (depending on what it is) which will earn you a currency called 'Cubits' which allow you to buy things in the ingame store such as classes or healing flasks because literally everything else in the store such as mounts, wings, chests and all that other stuff costs real money.  Although this game has a lot of negatives, there are a few positives too. Biomes. Biomes in this game are different areas you can explore which are different environments like snow, dragon peaks, isles with pirates, forest and even medieval highlands. All of these biomes have certain items in them that you can't get anywhere else such as gear, pets and crafting materials, and certain ores.  Another positive to this game (And probably the only other one) is the building/crafting mechanic. You have the complete freedom to build whatever you want in this game (providing it's in your cornerstone which is your buildable home, of course) so you can build a house, massive towers, massive male genitalia and whatnot. You can also get different colours such as green, black, blue... Screw it, the whole colour spectrum is at your disposal. You can also craft decorations such as 'gumball machines' (or whatever they're called over here in England), pool tables or you can even hang the heads of your enemies on the wall too. You will also be able to craft helpful items such as portals to get into different tier grindfests, different tools such as a forge to help improve your gear and other basic things in an MMO.  That's about it. If you're looking for an MMO which is nothing but a timewaster with the amount of building and grinding or if you are literally made out of money, this is the MMO for you. But if you are looking for and MMO with quests or an interesting story and whatnot, then there are plently of better MMOs out there and you should skip this one.

To even get to start of end game it will take you weeks of grinding , thats the content pre patch . After you reach Last updates endgame then you will hit the wall so hight that you wont see the end of it for months and months . The ridiculous enchanting system will make you waste HUNDREDS of hours to even get half way up that wall , the other half you wont see unless you spend money . The amount to spend wont be 10 or 20 $ it will take hundreds of $ for atempt to get top items since there is RNG on top of RNG on top of RNG .   So the grind in this game competes with the grindiest games you can find .   The question is 'Is it worth the grind ? ' .   ANSWER : HELL NO . There is litteraly 0 end game content .  1 . Map , end game zone or how ever you could call it in this game is copy / paste on every single zone in game . What that means is : You started game in zone 1 , you enter zone 2,3,4,5,.... and its litteraly same map , mini dungeons , enemyes Except on some of them textures are slightly darker .  2 . The Suposed RAID dungeon is for MAX 8 players . There are 4 bosses that have like 2-4 skills , basicly bigger world mobs . Those 4 bosses got 3 difficulty levels , just COPY / PASTE just with higher stats . Thats it 4 bosses FOR MMO .  3 . PVP . I doubt you can find more broken / unbalanced pvp in any MMO. On top of that , remember the thousands of hours you spend on getting gear ? Yeah you cant use it in pvp . PVP has basic stats , basicly no customization .   PROS: You can build amazing things , RLY you can do everything you can in minecraft . ♥♥♥♥ IT just play minecraft instead .  TL:DR - Game competes for place of the most grindest MMO . No PVP , No RAID dungeons , NO END game content . Almost as good as minecraft.",

Having all this in mind, I played the game to it's full potential alongside my sister and a friend: leveled up, slayed hundreds of shadows, built a house, raided dungeons, and even created a Club (basically what a guild is called in Trove) straight from scratch, and made friends along the way as well. On occasion, the game would close down due to the scheduled updates and patches being implemented into the game. Most of them would fix up the game, while others changed the game a bit here and there and gave things more flavor.   However, after spending so much time playing the game consistently and noticing it's only aspect was raiding dungeons, the game grew boring with each passing day from that point onward. Don't get me wrong, the game is great and they are constantly adding new things into the game so it's still growing in my opinion, but this is one of those games where if you spend WAY too much time on, things become bland and the spark just isn't there anymore. As a final verdict, I'll have to say that you should play the game and see how things go for you. Just, you know, play it at a pace that won't cause you to become extremely bored and tired of it; that way, it'll be much more fun when you get on the next time.",

If just to load a chunck takes around 30 seconds and by the time its loaded you would of probably died from an enemy hitting you and you cant do anyhthing back because your stuck loading. This gets me so frustrated when the hour quests are on... Getting from dungeon to dungeon takes way to long and I am usually a few points off the reward when the time runs out or get disconnected.

            "review_text": "Trove - A Voxel MMO RPG by Trion Worlds  Short version:  A building, exploring &amp; collecting game best described as silly fun.  Long version:  I've been playing Trove for about 2 and a half months now. Its very fun a fun game but not without faults.  Building - This has improved recently but even before this was very capable and this shows. While permanent building is restricted to cornerstones (your own private house) and club worlds, the amount of creativity is astonishing. People have made some truly amazing club worlds. There is a club world full of music, others with boat &amp; wing race courses and some truly awe inspiring creations.  Adventuring - There are no quests besides the tutorials designed to teach you the game. You just go out and find things to kill. Small lairs, huge dungeons and later on shadow arenas. Until you get towards the end game content (more on that later) its a very casual and relaxed game. While you dont form patries, working in groups is rewarding and allows you to push forward a little faster.  Collecting - As you progress through the game you earn mastery points. Mastery levels unlock various rewards (like wings at 20 and access to challenges at 30) with the untimate goal to reach max mastery (currently 200). Raising your mastery can be sped up a little with items from the shop but almost everything can be obtained in-game through work, trading or bought from the shop with in-game credits.  End game - End game currently is completing hourly challenges, shadow arenas and Uber 6 dungeons to get better gear and upgrade items. Challenges are admittedly a bit is a mess with huge zergs of adventurers rushing around a biome stripping it bare like a swarm of locusts. Its a mad rush to earn dragon caches but the best way to earn materials and resources required to upgrade gear.  Pay2Win &amp; RNG - Is it Pay2Win? In a word, no. There is no 'win' in trove. Even when PvP is added this shouldnt change. You can buy a patron pass that gives more XP, extra jump but none of these give you any kind of real advantage. Trove contains a lot of RNG. Dragon caches, adventure boxes, chaos chests, miner's troves, shadow caches, nightmare boxes and radiant caches (all earned in different ways) are all RNG boxes and rarely drop good items. None require money to open and are mostly just a bit of fun with a chance to get a cool mount, pair of wings or something equally as fun.   {LINK REMOVED}  Referral link so I can earn a dragon :) ",

(Batman bow, Teemo hat from League of Legends, Fins sword from Aventure Time and many more) +The game is super kid friendly and even the global chat seems to be quite polite most of the time +You can teleport to friends at any time +The game can run on pretty much any machine +Tradeing is easy and fast +Crafting is simple, same as gardening +You can get cool mounts and wings for in game currency!

My favorite so far is Neon City, it gives off that cyberpunk-esque tron vibe I've loved for years.  I almost wish this existed when I was younger, this could've been the game I spent years playing after school in grade school.",

The forums are incredibly strict and voicing your true opinion could get you banned on them.   With each update, they change more things that they shouldn't and don't care that their ridiculous ideas will possibly upset almost the entire experienced playerbase. Everything is now heavily RNG-based, which is beyond frustrating at times. If you want to progress you have to farm hours upon hours, with a high risk that in the end, it was for nothing, as upgrading gems fails very easily.   For being in Open Beta since 2014, the game is still beyond unstable, and each patch has a high chance of breaking the game entirely or making it very hard to play.   The devs claim to listen to the community, but for me personally it seems that all they do is come up with purchaseable solutions, making this game really difficult to play or enjoy without spending real money on it. If you want to decently progress in this game, you either have to have A LOT of free time, or buy Patron.   I really don't agree with how the weekly contests happen, as everything they have implemented in them only benefit the people who have gotten very far in the game and funnelled loads of money into it.   The latest updates have forced me to give up this game and move on, because the feelings of frustration and disappointment were stronger than my attempt at having a good time on it.   But if you're into hours of mindless grinding, frustrating devs who only think of how else they can milk cash from their playerbase, getting banned on the forums for voicing your opinions and having your posts deleted, spending money just to notice some kind of progress or dealing with massive lag ALL THE TIME, then i guess this game could be for you.   10/10 super disappointing.

            "review_text": "Trove is a bit-block game that is similar to Minecraft, but just like any other MMORPG out there. It still lacks that energy that will leave players hanging on and keep playing. Trove has expanded a lot since the pre-alpha stages, in terms of its UI, game mechanics, classes, and open-world generation. The character classes has adopted the same style as Firefall, where all the classes can be earned by collecting the Cubits (daily-earned currency) and redeeming them. If you're those who loves to collect the collectibles, maybe this game is good for you to continue in search of the items.  What's interesting behind the leveling system in Trove is that, the max Level that can be leveled is Level 20. But to move beyond Level 20, you need to obtain Shadow items, refining it, to further increase this capped level. Where maybe things starts to quite grinding as it goes further. Nevertheless it's not just about the leveling, but there is also Mastery system, where each items you collected or actions you have done in Trove accumulates into this system. So it is beneficial to focus on Mastery first.  Trove has a marvellous open-world generation, that you continue to explore the Uber-worlds. I'm sure none of the worlds are similiar in any sense, since it's a mega world with various biomes merged together. Besides fighting dungeon, you can also actively participate in the Club or Cornerstone, architectural building of blocks. Some of the creative worlds can be seen in forums, like Mario World or Pokemon's Pallet Town. Trove also been always very active in their server maintenance, every Tuesday. They have come out with numerous events and limited period items that allows players to hunt and collect these items.  For network wise, it is still playable for Asian players. Although you will experience a little bit of slow response in preloading of objects. Especially Trove sends objects in chunk that loads the next few segments of land, that is in your camera view. This is very adaptive, as Trove adopts the world generation feature. Similarly for dungeon when it comes to boss-battle, it is preloads it for just that instance, so don't worry about dying out.",

            "review_text": "My disclaimer: My hours played on Steam are not reflective of my actual in-game time. I installed from Trion's site last year, which will not show up here. If you average daily time X months, I would have in the ballpark of 800+ hours played. I loaded up the Steam version so I could post my review here.  Pre-level 20, the game is quite fun. Housing, crafting, exploring, and building will keep you occupied for hours and hours. It's the perfect game to play on those days when you are sick, and jacked up on cold meds. Casual, colorful, and something you can pick up and put down without much fuss.  After level 20 the game changes drastically. The Mantle of Power (MoP) update introduced a new gear system (Gems) that is entirely dependent on the Cash Shop, and a punishing degree of grind that affects experience gained, as well as items looted. Additionally, character progression is now measured in Power Rank, which is directly tied to Gems.  Before MoP, gear could be improved by using materials gained from breaking down looted drops and then using player made forges to upgrade quality and stats. It was a straightforward system, and as long as you had the materials you would upgrade your item on every combine.  Gems require materials as well, dust, which is gained from breaking down trash gems you don't need. However, rather than a guaranteed level increase when you click, you get a CHANCE for improvement. There is also a progress bar, which does not exist on regular gear. So, every time you click, you still burn materials but you are not guaranteed an incremental increase on the progress bar. On top of this, gems are designed to crack often. If that happens, you cannot improve your gem unless you repair it. This is where you discover the insidious design of MoP that requires you to use the Cash Shop.  Gems are designed to crack often. A Cash Shop item is the only thing that will fix that.  Gem upgrades are designed to fail, and take multiple attempts to fill a progress bar which represents one level. Gems have multiple levels, and I have seen some with 20-30. There are Cash Shop boosters that will give the CHANCE at an increase in progression, as well as other boosters that give a CHANCE at an entire level increase.  Addtionally, there is time gating on top of the high failure rate and high cracking rate. If you did not use boosters, your progress would stop on the first crack. If you only stopped your gem from cracking, or repaired it, you then have to face the horrendous requirement for materials (that you grind for) and the insane number of failures (with time gating) on the progression bar per level, every level.   For one gem, assuming you just used a booster to stop the cracking, it would take you MONTHS to level it. Currently, there are 9 gem slots. You do the math.  So, you need multiples of boosters that are only found in the Cash Shop, and your purchase does not guarantee that the item will work.  This ties in directly to how your character progresses, and what content you can enter. Power Rank (PR) increases as your gems are improved. Content is gated by a PR level requirement.   MoP was designed to grind progress to a molasses in January crawl. That is, unless you go to the Cash Shop..again, and again, and again. Paying real life money (for a chance) to improve your gear, and thus to allow you to access content that is otherwise gated, is the hallmark of Pay to Win. It is also gambling.  Consequently, the community has sharply deteriorated. People with common sense, who didn't want to be subjected to Trion's montetization schemes, left to greener pastures. The diehard fanboys now populate the forums, and make it their business to ridicule and shut down people that are critical of what Trove has become.   I simply cannot recommend Trove to new players. 6 months ago? Sure. Now? Don't even bother. They've taken a page from Runes of Magic horrible monetization tactics and integrated it into this game, ruining what was once a really amazing experience and community.  Game Development: 3/10  - There hasn't been any resources put into building and crafting since launch. No new recipes. No new materials. No new blocks. This game was marketed as a creative, sandboxy, building game and they've utterly abandoned their core principles in favor of cash grab Cash Shop re-skins and RNG loot boxes.  Customer Service: 3/10   - Copy paste answers, or outright incompetance.  Community: 5/10  - unhelpful in-game chat. Official forums are run by fanboys. Some good guilds remain, but most of the decent people have left for other games. Spammers and trolls fill the chat.   Game Devs: 2/10  - Game took a sharp turn for the worse at the beginning of 2016. Completely unresponsive to community feedback. Lack of real game development outside of loot boxes and Cash Shop items.  Cash Shop: 2/10  - Some cosmetics, and inventory expanders. Rest of it gives in-game advantage by giving Mastery points (which in turn give bonuses that affect gameplay). Gem Boosters are Cash Shop only, and are explained above.  Game Stability: 4/10  - Better than 5 months ago, but still unstable. Unexpected crashes and horrendous lag at times. Rubberbanding. Very common complaint that the Devs have acknowledged is a problem on their end, but they seem unable to fix even at this point.  Overall: 4/10  - Score would have been 8/10 half a year ago. Recent and ongoing updates create more and more dependence on using the Cash Shop. Cash Shop items give in-game advantages, and are required to advance character progression.",

The combination of the graphic style and gameplay melds together perfectly, and the exploration and combat both fitting together well. If you don't have any idea what games like this are like, but are feeling like you're missing adventure, try this game. Same can be said for vice versa. Hate adventure, but love voxel games, try it out.   I've loved every step of it, though the downtimes are extensive, I know that it's for the greater good and soon I'll be able to be online again.

The first part of the game was extremely fun. Finding all the new items was very thrilling, and going into big dungeons was always challenging and fun, especially with friends.  It was also fun to build up my house and make my items stronger.  But after about 10 hours of gameplay, the game went from one of the best games I've ever played to one of the most boring.  Why is the game boring? Because you do the same thing over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again. You only ever get 3 special abilities and you never get better combos as you level up. With my class, the gunslinger, all you ever have to do is: Jump. Attack. Jump. Attack. Jump. Attack. The other classes I've used aren't much better.  The bosses are quite stupid, and are quite low-quality for today's standards of RPG games. I've played multiple Final Fantasy games, and I know what a smart boss is like. All the enemies in this game are so stupid... all they ever do is just rush at you.  This game also suffers from a large lack of content, though that is an easy fix. However, they cannot fix the lack of veriety in the game. It suffers the same problem that vanilla Minecraft does: you do the same thing over and over again, and it gets quite boring.  The first part of the game and the overall concept of the game gets a 9/10.  After about 10 hours of gameplay, I give it a 5/10 for being really boring after a while.",

I really liked it at the start actually. What really makes this game completely suck is the gem system that was implemented in the Mantle of Power update. See you can play and have fun progressing until you get to the last stage of the game which is Uber 9. Then the gems you have actually matter then. Which is the problem. -.- The RNG in this game is worse than any game I have ever played. Not only do you get random stats when farming gems, but even if you happen to get the right stats it will most likely still not be a good gem. Gems range from 0 to 3 stars at level 1. 3 stars being the best obviously. This might sound confusing but you see the amount of stars you have at level 1 dictate wether the gem is good or not. If that sounds stupid that's because it is. Also when it comes to farming stellar gems in Uber 9 you will most likely not get the stellar gem until you open enough boxes. You can open 70 boxes to get a gaurunteed stellar or 35 if you have patron. Which is also ridiculous. The point I'm making is that you can basically farm forever and get nowhere at all. Especially without patron. I don't recommend this game and I won't recommend this game until the gem system is changed.",

If you haven't already guessed by the amount of hours I've put into this thing, I've been with this game since the early days, when everyone started as the knight by default, and you didn't need to use credits (currency bought with real money) just to buy other classes. Sure you'd get the occasional class coin to unlock another one for free, but at this point in time it's not very friendly to new players that have the misfortune of wanting to start playing the game in this current meta of what's basically pay to win. Now I know I'm probably not the only one who's complaining about 'the good old days', but seriously, why are the other classes barred off with real money currency? I can understand skins, and even those 'patron bonuses', but I just think it's dumb to bar off new characters with this monetary wall.   I still occasionally visit because of the time (and sadly, money) that I've thrown into this game, but I can't play it as fervently as I used to, cause mmo's are mostly meant to play with friends, and the pay to win model puts a lot of them off. I realize this was less about gameplay and more of a complaint about the company's business choices, but honestly I don't think I could say anything about the game itself that'll convince anyone to look past the pay-to-win model. Maybe if they decide to go back on the money-centric game ideals, I'll boot the thing back up and dive in again. But as of time of writing, I can't recommend the thing.",

The game itself is a somewhat frustrating grind for either ores or flux which would seem to be the two things needed most to progress later on, the building feature is very interesting as well, being able to create wide lengths of blocks at once but at the same time rather twitchy and frustrating to get used to as i find myself placing blocks through walls or even behind me. The biggest and most annoying problem with the game is the logging in Queue time, i have heard this was fixed but i see very little improvement and i find myself waiting in a 10 minutes remaining window for more then an hour even counting how long it took. I understand the creators are still working out some of its issues and trying to fix as much as they can so i won't hold it against them due to them creating one of the most popular games to just recently hit Steam and perhaps were not expecting it to grow with such speed. All flaws aside, Trove is a fantastic game and i would strongly recommend it to many players, i give this game a ''7 / 10'' for its ability to keep me playing even past its flaws.",

Ingredients: 1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 2. 1/2 cup white sugar 3. 1/2 cup brown sugar 4. 1/4 cup water 5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon 6. 1 pinch salt 7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced 8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie   Directions: 1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.  Eat.",

Pros:  Definitly is a great MMO-RPG What I mean is, the 'role playing game' is important and without a team after level 12 you WILL die. A LOT. The 'mmo' part, it has an AMAZING community, one of the best i've seen in any game. Great class veriety. Hey, thats always important. You can edit your looks anytime, for free! I'ts growing SUPER quick! I've noticed so many new people through the week. (and their usually advanced players) There are a lot more, but that will take a bit long and its all about the crafting system. Also, best of all its not pay to progress or be OP. IT'S ALL FREE TO PLAY! Well 99% of it.  Cons: The building is dreadful. The way to build your cornerstone (little plot you own) is hard and frustrating for everyone that I have met who owns this game. They released it today, that means 'new people!' but sadly, not only are there new people but, come trollers, hackers, and giant noobies to the MMORPG genre. I havn't encountered hackers yet but, i'm sure I will.  Other then that it's a great game and suggest you to check it out if you havn't, just give it some time.  ps. don't listen to my hours I have a lot more then that.",

Edit - Managed to fix the launcher, and I'm sucked back into the game for the most part.

Having network/server issues in that situation is understandable, because it wasn't expected to explode in popularity the way it did. After dozens of 'improvements &amp; upgrades' to their servers, netcode, databases, etc., the game is still painful to try and play today.  For reference, today, a Friday, had a peak of 17.8k players on Steam. Far cry from almost 70k, no? And somehow, despite all these improvements, the servers are going down almost daily. If they aren't down, the latency is so bad that you 'rubberband' so badly at times that it gets you killed, or disconnected from the server during VERY bad times. (Like the new end-game content they released instead of addressing server issues!)  Aside from the stability issues, the economy in this game is absolutely boned. The latest content update that brought the newest class, the Lunar Lancer, destroyed the economy in a massive way. Not only did it make end-game crafting materials harder to get (which was fine, honestly), which caused them to rise in price as expected... they also destroyed your ability to gain the currency to buy said items!   Long story short, this game is currently  NOT  worth your time. Until Trion fixes at least the network stability, just pass this up unless you want to pull all your hair out.",

Pros: - The combat is very fast-paced and fun - The amount of character customization is insane! - The cornerstone system (basically a moving house you design) is both brilliant and fun to build - Tons of unique biomes, dungeons, enemies, and bosses - Way too many props and block types to possibly get bored building - Good social system with friends lists and clubs - Not PAY-TO-WIN  Cons: - Difficult to solo some of the higher level areas (but way fun with a group) - Sometimes gets a little repetitive  - Difficult to find some of the needed crafting materials - Currently no PvP (will be added in future according to devs) - Some shop items take A TON of in-game currency to purchase  Also a note: Currently they have bad queue times to log into the server, which is full of new players from Steam. The devs have already released server patches to help with the issue, and are constatly adding new hardware, but until the flow of new players settles down a bit, expect to be waiting a while to log in (sometimes half an hour). Once you are on though, the servers are smooth and stable.   Overall I highly recommend this game. It is fun, especially with a group, and it has loads of content to use with more coming all the time. Feel free to add me on Trove (player name: jackobuddy) and happy building!!!",

Though do take note of the Queue to get in game and often downtime, developers try to keep in touch with players and keep them informed as much as possible and I expect they will work out the major issues sometime soon. Rather nice community, nicer than most of the online comunities. I have seen a few updates adding new fetures so that is something to look forward to to see new additions, also notably, is you can create items and gear and submit it for a chance of it getting added in.  Though the building is slightly bland, not as many options as I'd like for colours of blocks but I expect that to change aswell with time. There really is no PTW (Pay To Win) involved but if you wish you can use money to acuire cosmetic items and a few gameplay items  All in all very fun, and if you feel as if something else should be in game you can reccomend it to the developers",

The unique characters with varying playstyles and difficulty levels, the addictive, charming gameplay and stunning, gorgeous yet simple, low end graphics make Trove one of my all time favourites. It's hard to believe that this masterpiece is indev. And heck, it's absolutely FREE! Sure, there are DLC's, and yes, they are overpriced, but do you really need to buy them? I think every user on steam should at least give this game a try. However, the servers are chock full most of the time, so don't be suprised if you have to wait to get in. But, if they are that full, then Trove is obviously good. Other than that, it's great!  My final verdict:  Pros: Addictive, simple and charming gameplay. Fun classes such as the Knight, Fae trickster and my personal favourite: the Neon Ninja Low end computer requirements Helpful community Constant updates  Cons: Lag spikes Servers can be crowded Sometimes a Disconnect Simulator  All in all: 9/10  I highly reccomend it.",

The excitment when unlocking the new class just because I spent lots of time on grinding... It's gone now.

Trove let's you build your own home/base with a ton of options in a nice sudo-8bit voxel style. You can explore dungeons, go on mini raids, sail on the ocean and fight pirates, fly, and much more. It is a free game with an in game store, but nothing in there utterly breaks the game experience. The store has some cosmetics with the same stats as anything in the game. There is a nice selection of classes in Trove with more being added fairly often that shake up the playing experince from something like Minecraft. Each class has it's own skills and more are unlocked as you level that class up. The classes can be swapped on the fly all on the same character, so if you don't like the feel of a certain class you can always swap with no harm! The combat system is simple but smooth and fun. There is something for the more casual players in this game of making a nice home, and having some fun exploring with friends, and then some nice end game dungeons for a little more devoted player, along with rare mounts to craft/collect. The game also encourages playing with others as you share loot and 'glim' or gold income. A very funny game to play with some friends. With a development team that is very social with it's community I can only highly recommend this little gem. 9/10.",

I woke up at 5 AM local time, tried to log on. 30 min queue, disconnect, retry. Finally was able to log in and do a tutorial which made the game seem colorful and fun, but after I killed the very first mob the game asked me to press H to warp to the hub and crashed.   Since then I haven't been able to log in because you get disconnected from the queue before you can ever try and play. This game LOOKs interesting and I want to play, but I simply CAN'T, because the devs do not have proper infrastructure.  I'll consider re-reviewing this game if I am ever _actually able to play it_.

Pros: -Fun take on the 'minecraft' style sandbox.  -Quirky and goofy gear skins, make the game entertaining for family and friends.

There are no multiple characters per account and you have no option of deleting characters.   The controls also feel weird: they aren't clunky, but they aren't smooth either. The combat feels transparent and there is no real substance to your attacks. The way the UI has been designed is off-putting, you have no option, that I found, of zooming into your menu as any click you attempt to make on it just exits it, you also have no way of clicking on certain chat options meaning that you will have to figure out the commands to get into specific chats.  The graphics have clearly been inspired from Cube World and I swear that the long grass looks like it has been directly ripped from that game and it feels like they have taken too much inspiration from Cube World for it not to be a blatant rip off.

I currently have 4 saved from different times.  Once this game went out of Beta and released on Steam, there have been major improvements server-side. There were queues to get into the game for 60+ minutes at times, and now they're rebuilding the infrastructure to include better gameplay/graphic abilities.  Overall, if you're a collector this game is for you. Unfortunately(much to my despise) they instituted a PvP Arena(which is fairly balanced by all measures) that awards items that a collector such as myself are forced to endure a part of play that I do not enjoy in order to attain these items.  The game is very fast-paced once you go into the adventure realms. You go from dungeon to dungeon killing bosses for chests that contain loot, and more and more rare items to be found. The amount of collecting in this game took me 8 months just to finish all the different weapon styles available(and made by players).  The movable house (Cornerstone) is a good idea, and now you can have multiples. In the harder Adventure worlds the cornerstones are less and less available, making healing/loot collecting a might bit harder.  However: I am noting that this is more Trionworld's fault than it is the Developers, but the game has become increasingly P2P. The bonuses players receive by purchasing a subscription are sickening to me. What took me 6 months to do, they can do in 2 now.  The marketplace is already inflated, and is going to get even more so. There is only 1 in-game-currency sink in the game, and it only inflates prices even further than before.  People are allowed to play on multiple instances in the game to exploit collecting different types of items so long as they're not automated... but come on- we all know it happens. The community can be a bit trying at times. There are many rude people, a lot of younger people, and some salty people. Overall most just like to have fun and spammers are quickly dealt with. Trading is pretty much flawless. You can't get ripped off unless you allow yourself to be. Fishing is arduous, but the collection is pretty nifty. You can get different trophies for different size fish, as well as trophies for every mob in the game (some are unavailable now and fetch a steep price).  8.5 / 10 I still play, I will continue to play until I am forced to pay out of pocket to enjoy my experience.",

            "review_text": "Nearly 3 hours in. I still haven't played a single second of the game.  Update: tl;dr: Enjoying the game, but when I first started playing I had major technical issues.  It seems as of the day after I posted this the servers have improved massively, I just didn't get around to updating the review.  Although I can't speak for everyone, my personal experience for the first 4 hours or so of dealing with trove was very poor. The signup for 'glyph' would repeatedly refuse my passwords, and would take quite a long time to send the emails. After near-on an hour messing around with the signing up I managed to get in game, only to be greeted with huge wait times to even connect.  This only proceeded to annoy me further as you can't change settings (fullscreen, sound options, resolution, ect) until you have SUCCESSFULLY JOINED the game.  I personally was annoyed by this to no ends because despite the horrendous state of the servers (when I originally posted), yet they had a working micro-transaction store.  After getting in-game I was repeated encountering my computer completely crashing (which happened on no other games), but this seems to have stopped now. (This was likely a problem on my side, but as I said, it happened only on Trove).  BUT.  After all this, I managed to finally be able to play the game, and I am actually really enjoying it. I still don't like the fact it has the availability of micro-transactions but I have yet to feel like they actually influence the game, since the game contains no PvP (that I can see), and I am really not feeling any pay-walls or 'pay2win' at all.  I usually don't defend the mindless comments like 'itz nut pay2wen itz pay 3 shurtcut' but I can safely say that it does feel like one of those rare occasions when the only people paying will be those who have too much money to play the game properly.  There are a lot of bugs still in-game, and the servers still like to die a lot randomly though, but they seem to be being resolved over time.  Also loot in dungeons drops per person, so there will be no loot stealing or similar, and that I really like.  Overall the gameplay itsself is really solid, but only if you can see through the major flaws it has covering it.",

Second of all, I haven't played that much, but still like it (a lot)! Minecraft's about building and exploring, but this actually is more, combat-y.  Pros: + You wanna get stuff, it might be biome-based. Means it's more exploration-based + Unique building (unlike Minecraft, in this you can also get rarer drops from mining) + LOTS of cosmetics + LOTS of hats (TF2 anyone?) + LOTS of weapons + LOTS of customization in general. + Wide, open-world + Difficulty of worlds are balanced, so you don't need to farm that much to survive the next world. + Free + Only paid things are cosmetic, although you have to pay for boosters (premium rank) + Devs notify you when servers will go down (if they are) + Bugs are addressed and action taken quickly + Mounts + Wings (Awesome Face Ball anyone?) + Variety of enemies and bosses, from giant furnace things to pirate parrots. + A lot of other things + No compulsory PVP  Cons: - Premium Rank costs a lot, which heavily unbalances the game - The default keys are annoying (Q is right above 1, which I use a lot, which can be /very/ annoying) - Long wait times (not always though, and it's an MMO so it's not entirely a con, just an annoyance) - Limited skills  Total: 9.8/10 'Not enough classes' - IGN (JK, there's quite a few)",

What I mean by that is there are specific places you can put your house called 'cornerstones'. They are pads with a sign in front of them. Activate the sign and your house pops up there. YOur house is completely customizable as long as it remains within the confines of the cornerstone. (conrnerstones are all one size)  The weapon and gear system is unique here. Once you collect a style, you can apply it to anything you equip.

Hold down left mouse and press the 1 or 2 button a few times, use some basic exploits to trap the boss in a hole while you poke at him unharmed for 10 minutes until he finally dies. Experience running around and killing stuff over and over again while farming for stuff that requires like 5000 items to make something that looks kind of cool but doesn't actually improve your abilities or gameplay, just to realize that there's this one set and a few hundred others like it that you can BUY for like 10 bucks.  Emerse yourself in getting slightly better stuff every 50 dungeons that feels absolutely no different nor does much different. Meet shallow classes with different versions of decent looking attacks that all do the same thing then hop into an exploitable dungeon where you just hop around for a while and hit stuff while demanding absolutley no skill whatsoever because there are no dodge mechanics and the game just assumes you have enough DPS to kill him before he kills you. Oh, and did I mention that there are only so many dungeons, they're all really short and boring, can be simply skipped and jumped over depending on how many jumps you can use or how many bombs you have, only to make it to a boss with no redeeming qualities?  Why does anyone continue to play this game? There is absolutely no challange other than mindlessly hacking and slashing away at useless crapand the possiblility that you don't have enough DPS for the boss.  Uninspired, lame old blocky graphics, boring/redundant gameplay, pointless farming, undifferentiated weapons, NO PvP, characters that supremely outDPS others, oh yeah, and a FISHING ACTIVITY WHERE YOU F***ING STARE AT THE SCREEN FOR AN HOUR WAITING FOR YOUR BAIT TO BOB SO THAT YOU CAN GET A BORING FISH THAT YOU CEN SELL FOR MINISCULE AMOUNTS OF MONEY. AND THEN DO IT AGAIN. AND AGAIN. AND AGAIN. WHAT?

Cons:  1) The servers are consistantly crashing.  2) The dungeons in the game are to ridiculous for one man to accomplish. To many NPC's in one rooms and it's nearly impossible to avoid dying. How I see this can be fixed is by dungeon que's or something to force players to team up to defeat dungeons.  3) NO PVP, big let down for me.  4) Pay to win majorly, if you actually purchased one of the packages, you are pretty much OP if you get legendary items, or buy wings. You pay for stats in the game which I don't really agree with.  5) It's similar to Minecraft, just this is free. They have a few neat improvements that Minecraft should've done from the start, but this game is nearly the same feel to it at this point in time.  Now time for the Pros of the game.  Pros:  1) The game has absolute potential to be the most played game of 2016, just they really need to take this money they are recieving and put it into a better DNS or VPN. Consistant crashes and reconnects is a fast way to loose your players.  2) So many players online! This is great for if you want to meet friends and etc, though the crashes are from how many players they have gotten since the release.  3) Colorful and imaginative.  4) Mounts, wings, and more! I like how this game is not directed towards a set time frame, such as Medieval. The way the game runs is pretty outstanding with wierd designs that are supported in by the community.  5) The game relies on one to run with a group of players in order to succeed. Though the way you do this is not quite user friendly. I am a level 7 and still have not yet been able to figure out how to make a Clan/Group/Guild. Many players call it different things in game.  My reccomendations to the player(s).  Make sure you have a good internet connection, and plenty of storage for the game. The game at this time takes a lot of data to run, so make sure you have some RAM on deck. From what I have heard and seen, the developers are trying to make it to where ANY PC user can play it, regardless of how low or high priced it is. Make sure you do talk to people and try to form groups to complete challenging dungeons together, otherwise you will loose your magic power when you die, which is what allows you to hit high rates on the NPC. Be sure to also tell your friends to join for perks and what not through the offical webpage. RAF is a great bonus for the game with neat prizes for your efforts.  I still think the game needs immediate action taken on the servers. This game will only go downhill with a high name on Steam at Rank 10. Developers, you need to get to work now before this amazing game just dissapears.",

First off I'd like to say that if you aren't interested in getting really REALLY serious about playing then I can't reccomend it. You will probably have to spend a ♥♥♥♥ ton of money too. If you are still interested then thats great and lets get into the major points.   This game has so much to it and is still being updated so I can't reccomend it enough. Seriously it will take everything in your power to quit once you start playing. There is a seemingly infinite amount of things to do. There's also something for everyone from everything from catching fish to killing everything. Some may tell you that this game is pay to win but not exactly. Every item in the game is obtainable (aside from bonuses from supporting the game but its like 3 items) and most of the items you can pay for are completeley cosmetic (aside from a few). The only issue with this is that some items may be unobtailable after some time and can only be gotten from other players. At certain points these old items will be made available again which in turn will drastically drop the price and ♥♥♥♥ over anyone who recently bought something off another player with in game currency. So basically you get ♥♥♥♥ed by how high the price is or by how the market price drops and makes flux (the in game currency) near worthless. I remember when Penta-Forged shadow souls were worth 30k flux and that was alot. After I logged in and got offered 260k+ for a single one. If you want an economy like 1930's Germany, then you've got one. But hey that's what grinding for months only to be ♥♥♥♥ed over is all about!   I joke but in all seriousness this game is great and you should at least try it out.  TL;DR - 1930's Russia sucks at economics  ",

Which shouldn't be a proper excuse, some people are getting 1000m+ wait time... That's not normal. And I mean that's not normal, the usual wait time is literally 5-30 minutes if the servers are crowded. The developers are doing all they can, and people are also complaining of lag spikes. It's because so many people are trying to access the servers... How about you come back when the servers are upgraded and write a proper review after 10+ hours of gametime? That'd be great!  Edit: Also It's f*cking free to play. Why does it matter?  Personally, I rate this game a solid 8.5/10.  The grinding for mastery levels can get difficult but you know. There are other ways to level up mastery, a good way for me is to find lots of Relics (U-2 World) and use the Loot Collector. Eye of Q'buthulu(?)'s everywhere! The reason why I couldn't give it a 9 is because there's no party system like in WoW yet, me and my friend would love a party system so we could see each others HP and Energy bar.   Another issue I kind of have is that the HUD Is a bit sketchy when it comes to being hurt. There's no signal your health is lowering either fast or slow, your screen doesn't change colour until you're in the last 5%. This hasn't got me killed yet, but I feel it will soon. I just wish there was a better damage indicator. This will sound weird, but one like the Super Street Fighter IV Would be amazing; always knowing when you're around half-health. It's useful, you know?  Now, this game has microtransactions. But funny enough, you don't need to buy anything to advance in the worlds! Sure it'd speed it up by a bit, but in the end it will feel better if you grind for Pearl's of Wisdom instead of getting 3 with the Power Pack. For $20/£15. And they aren't huge leaps anyway, you'll be able to buy a good mount with the in-game currency that I can't remember the name of. You know, the hollowed out rectangle that's multicoloured. that one.  I just recommend everyone to give this game a shot once the servers are either a bit more dead or they're upgraded. It will give a much better experience, as I've seen no valid reasons why not to like this game... bye",

            "review_text": "I have 50 hours in this game. I feel that it will soon transform to 100 and hundreds more after that.  The thing about this game that makes it annoying is there is so much encouragement to keep playing, keep grinding, keep fighting, keep upgrading, keep crafting, keep collecting, keep exploring, etc.  With the new expansion coming out, 'Mantle of Power' that will essentially double the amount of time it takes to max out a class makes the game more compelling and exciting, with more biomes, abilities, item rarity, mounts, levels, and classes, right now is a great time to pick up Trove.  First of all, there is so much this game hands to you for free. You start the game with one class you may choose. This is not a game that restricts any classes in the beginning. You can play any class you want. However, getting new classes costs Credits, the game's premium currency, but this is not a problem.  With the game's feature of a player market, many items that may seem 'Pay To Win' or 'Premium' can be bought and traded for via community, such as Class Coins and Cosmetics. It simply is not right to call this game pay to win. A better way to say it is pay to advance. The game has a very fun sense of progression, and limitless amounts of items to farm and grind for. If that's not your type of thing, simply buy advancement.  There are many biomes and types of dungeons to grind with your friends it seems like my life is starting to slip into the abyss. All I know is Trove.   Combat is not too intuitive, but still fun nevertheless. Professions really make the game grindworthy, such as ringcrafting, runecrafting, gardening, and crafting. Another fun feature of the game is Mastery Rank, which measures how much experience you have in the game. Your mastery rank stays the same as you switch between classes.  Overall I think it would take you over 70+ hours to max out a class in the game. There are 14, and with the new expansion coming out that expands class level limit, It's going to be one hell of a grind.   So, in conclusion - Trove is a well polished voxel sandbox MMORPG definitely worth downloading and playing. Very grindy and time consuming, and contains the ability to switch in between classes without having to make a new account, reducing repetetive gameplay and enhancing the game experience.  I feel this game is within the 9/10 &amp; 9.5/10 range of a game, but because of how much time this game is sucking out of me I'm giving it a..   10/10 - Download and see for yourself if you like it. This review cannot contain all the positives of the game, and while there are cons, they really don't effect the game in ways that would dull down your enjoyment.",

            "review_text": "I decided to rewrite this and turn it into an actual review.  Trove is interesting to say the least, with intricate yet simple crafting, bright colors, diversity of classes, and a huge amount of customization - I mean, where do you start with a game like this?  Well we'll start with the pretty colors since that'll take the least time to go over. One of the main reasons I was drawn to Trove in the first place was because of its beautiful color palette and cubic/pixelized art style - in short, it looked like a ton of fun. What's great about this is that while colorful, it's very rare that my eyes get tired of seeing the wide array of shapes and color.  Next is customization, there's plenty to do here with mounts, wings, boats, sails, mag(netic) riders, allies, equipment, and so on - quite frankly, there's so much customization here it's kind of scary (in a good way). It's highly unlikely you'll find many people running around with the same exact stuff as you, which shows how much thought Trion put into customization of characters (as well as loot drops).  After that, crafting - now I'm not going to stay here long because after reading about all of the customization, you can see where crafting is heading - in fact, I think I'll just leave crafting for you to imagine for yourself.  Lastly, a topic that seems to have sparked heated remarks in the comments sections of reviews all across Trove's page - diversity of classes. Now when beginning Trove, players can choose any class they wish for free - after that, they can get a few more for free as they progress through the game (now comes the contraversy), you can also choose to spend money on classes *Gasp*. Now, the reason many have been uptight about this is because while (as far as I know) it is entirely possible to gain every character class for free, it requires a LOT of grinding. *Double Gasp* Grinding?! In a game about loot and customization?! Who does that? Game devs, WHY U DO THIS??!  Because if they didn't you'd get bored with the game way too easy and they would have to pump out WAY more content every day than they did the day before, just to keep players satisfied, which is selfish of the player, completely unreasonable, and unattainable. It simply isn't possible for game devs to keep going at that pace forever - especially if they aren't making any money off of it. They have bills to pay just like you and me folks, which brings us to (Dramatic Music Here) paying for stuff in-game.  You can grind for a while and earn almost everything in-game, or you can just accelerate the process by paying real money to get the classes you want (This is MUCH quicker).  Quite frankly, if you can't stomach the fact that game devs running a Free-to-Play have given players the option to buy certain things to make their gameplay experience go a bit more streamlined, then you have no business playing video games period.  Again, they've got bills to pay too, and to ask them to provide these services without the option to pay for some of their services - is to ask them to be slaves, and that's not cool guys.  Don't be slave drivers, just have fun.",

Too simple. Lots of players still have problems with the simplest things though, like finding dungeons (which is the gaming equivalent of tying your own shoelaces), so I suppose the target audience of this game is basically... kids and special people. -The equipment system is ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Super, SUPER BAD. There isn't enough randomness and stat variety in it. This means that you'll rarely EVER find upgrades to your gear. Seriously. There aren't many equipment slots either. Finding loot isn't fun that way. It is rather boring, actually. As a fresh character you'll find Uncommon items. Play a few minutes and you'll only find rare items. A few more minutes with your char and you'll only find epics. A few more minutes and you'll only find legendaries. A bit later on relics and higher quality items become completely commonplace as well. once I dinged lvl10 (takes only a few hours), I didn't find an item upgrade for about 20 hours of gameplay when I was already lvl22. This is bad design. -The gameplay is rather antisocial -The playerbase is rather antisocial -The online gaming's usual 'European servers = Russian speaking servers' -LONG queues.

            "review_text": "Soo after taking a break from the game I came back and there are a lot of changes.  The gem system You now can have gems equiped on your classes, these boost your stats and give you more PR. We have 3 types of gems, Water, Air and Fire. You can equip 3 gems on each type (2 tiny gems and 1 empowered gem).  You are no longer able to buy classes with cubits Now I disagree with this feature, but the good part is that you can still buy classes with flux soo in the end you can still get the class you want by playing the game.  Battle Arena When I played we didn´t have a pvp mode, now we do. You have two battle modes Catch the Flag and Team Death Match.  Is The Game P2W? The definition of P2W changes from person to person. Pay to Win for me is when you can directly buy better gear or allow you to make better items then everyone else making the game unbalanced.  Now I think Trove is Pay to Progress Faster kind of game, Player X can buy wings from the store with real money while Player Z will take 3 days to get the flux to buy those wings in-game.  Soo after all these changes do I still recomend the game? Yes. It is definetly harder for new players to get into the game and progress, but if you enjoy the game you won´t have problems. In the end is up to the person playing to define if the game is for you or not.  -------------------------------------------------------//------------------------------------------//--------------------------------------  I normally don't review for games but I had to give my opinion on this one. I started playing in November, one of my friends from another game recomended it to me, my first thought of the game while watching youtube videos about it was: ' Another minecraft clone? Hmm oh well im gonna try it anyways'....Now I look back and think how wrong I was. Currently I am a veteran player I have spent hours in this game and I totally love it.  Classes -You can choose between 11 classes and switch to another class whenever you want, wanna play a Ninja that can hide in the shadows and trow shurikens? Wanna play has an undead mage that call skeletons from the dead? Or maybe has a pirate that travels the sea? You can choose anything you want. -All of them are unique with different weapons and play style you will have fun leveling each one of them up.  Environment -Trove not only gives us a variety of classes to choose from but it gives us a lot of biomes to discover. -From a sky realm, undead biome, treasure isles, and much more you will have your hands full with exitment.  Mounts, Boats, Wings and....Dragons!? -Ever thought about mounting a spider, a frozen cat or even an war horse? Well fear not trove has all that and much more. -You can travel the sea with many diferent boats and sails, and guess what?! They even come with canons that can tear your enemies to dust. -Who doesnt want to discover the wonders of a realm in the sky? well with trove wings you can do just that and..well look cool while doing it. -The newest addicion on trove regasrding mounts were Dragon...now who doesnt want a dragon has a mount? But trion didnt let it just end like that, they made it soo dragons cold fly and even shoot fireballs!!  Professions -Trove gives us players a variety of professions to level up each of them beying unique and diferent. -Runecrafting, Ringcrafting, Gardening and Fishing.  The Developer Team -I think this is something i need to talk about, the developer team here on trove is totally different from soo many others. -They are always watching us, they interact with us in game, they LISTEN (in this case read) our concerns about the game and even take our suggestions.  PVP -Many people were disapointed pvp was not in the game but fear not its coming, the developers are working on it.  Cornerstones -This is an unique feature trove has, you have your own little pocket house were you can destroy, construct and do anything you like with it.  Clubs -Trove doesnt have Guilds it has Clubs, you can join up to 5 clubs at a time. -Constuct and interact with your friens in clubs.  Cons -Trove is not only positive things it has is problems too here are some of them:  -End game content laking.  -It can get repetitive and a little bit grindy somethimes.  Conclusion Stop Reading And Go Play It! 9/10",

But i can tell that developers are always in listening to improve and solve problems. Instead they have just done more improvements. Also a lot of people speack about 'paytowin' but is not a game where you win something. if you pay you can obtain faster item and equip, but you win nothing. Last thing, the item, mount, equip, dragoon that you can buy with money are also in sale in the marketplace in game for gamemoney (flux). For me trove is a good game that could be improve in this years and suitable for all people.",

Now you can get everything (i think) that the pay to play players get it just takes ALOT longer. Dragon mounts to fly though the sky for example endless hours of grinding. But hey you do get a dragon in the end well at least half of it. But either way this game all around is very fun. Play with friends, Build a costom house, Costomize the mask, hair, skin, and hat on your character. Its a fun game if you have the time for it.",

            "review_text": "One of the best MMO-type Minecraft-esque game I've played in a very long time. This is by far one of the best PLAY-to-win games on the FREE market. Nearly everything you can buy with real cash you can get by playing the game regularly (with the exception of skins for classes). The grind isn't as HORRIBLE as Warframe. I'll list some pro's and con's from the few hours I've played:  Pros: - Classes have very few skills (4 in total) but those skills complement each other EXTREMELY well. When you play one, you know that the skills that they have were to be used in a certain way. - As stated above, everything is buyable by simply PLAYING THE GAME.  - For the first 10 levels, it's not too hard. You can get by with each character playing it safe. Past that, difficulty skyrockets and the game forces you to do extremely difficult end-game dungeons with multiple players so it doesn't turn into Solo-Fighter-Online - The 'base' system was extremely well thought out. You build your home and everytime you need something from home, you bring the home to YOU rather than being teleported to another place.   Cons: - EXTREMELY laggy at some points in the game. Usually after 2 PM EST, the servers will fill up to maximum capacity at which point you will be put on a queue. This queue on average lasts 20 minutes and will fluctuate up and down depending on how many people are on the queue with you. - Frequent downtimes on the servers for maintenance or hotfixes that last a long, long time. It only feels that way because the game is so good.   Keep in mind this only got released recently and the team has been working their ASSES off trying to get servers back online in working order to service this buttload of players. All in all, this is an extremely satisfying game to play if you have any interest in MMO's or Crafting/Minecraft-esque games.",

Pros:   - Amazing community, lots of people playing and the people are helpful to new players  - The graphics are very simple yet very nice to look at.  - The gameplay is fun you can use any of the wide variety of classes to play as.   - Leveling up and/or proceeding through the game does not require mini transactions. Mini transactions only change the visual aspect of your characters.  - The trading system is great.   Cons:  - You will need patience and some time to level up and proceed to higher mastery ranks to unlock new things. But that is not a big problem since you would probably play this game a lot, if you like mmorpgs.",

With Trove, It's fun for a while, I loved it for quite a bit, then it boils down to one of two things. 1: Farm the same bosses and areas you've been playing since the beginning of the game for days on end to hit the point in the game where you can get anything you've ever wanted! As long as your willing to farm even MORE for it. 2: Blow a huge amount of money on just buying the Overpowered Items once you hit max level.

            "review_text": "---Update 8/15/15:--- I don't really know what happened. I guess the novelty just wore off over time, and I find myself thoroughly disinclined to play this game anymore. I'm mostly disappointed that I kept my faith in the developers for as long as I did.   This game falls short when it comes to it's mid-endgame 'challenges,' which are hourly events that reward players with an rng chest that mostly just spits out a bunch of flux, which is considered the main currency and is the primary material you use to upgrade your weapons. Challenges are not fun. Every hour on the hour you have twenty minutes to clear dungeons in a specified biome, with bonuses for playing as one of two specified classes, and a bonus for playing on one of the two highest 'difficulty' worlds.  People complain that this leads to zerging, which I only did once before deciding that I just wouldn't do it. Because it's not fun. I thought that I would instead spend my time mining for other materials and save up to be able to trade when a global market comes out. A few weeks later and I'm still waiting for that promised update.  And this is where my disappointment really kicks in. Devs put out a lot of new content every week. This would be great, but each round of new content comes with new and more bugs and issues. If you're like me and don't encounter these issues yourself, you get to experience the disappointment of seeing them brought up in the forums and realize that there's even more work to be done before they can even get to focusing on content updates that you actually care about, the ones that actually mean anything.  There's promises of upcoming changes to challenges, and promises of a global market being introduced, but I fear that by the time these things come out, there will be so many bugs and issues with every update between now and then that it'll take even more weeks before these updates will have their own bugs ironed out. And by that time there will be even more content with even more bugs to further perpetuate the issues.  It's a fun game, and it seemed like it was going in the right direction, but I fear that unless the devs pull back on adding new content and spend a few update cycles dedicated to bug fixes, this game will progressively get more and more difficult to enjoy, as it already has been.  My optimism for this game and it's developers has turned into disappointment, but as a free game, it may still be worth trying. Personally, I do plan to continue to keep an eye on the game's forum and log in once in a while, however, I can no longer say that I particularly recommend this game.   ---Update 7/30/15:---  Due to the issues of a patch release causing downtime that lasted most of the day, players who log in this weekend should obtain free items. I'm not sure if completely brand new players will be able to get in on the free class token and cubits, but it might be a good time to join just in case.  Queues and wait times have been reduced considerably, but there's still some waiting once in a while. Last week there was a lot of lag issues to contend with as well, though I believe most of that should be fixed with the current state of the game. There was mention of a bug involving enemies walking out of the loaded area of a world causing the database to start to cave in on itself. These two days since the aformentioned patch downtime have been pretty smooth for playing, but I did have a five minute queue to wait one of the times I logged in yesterday.   The game is still definitely fun. Since my first review, I've leveled up one of my characters to 20 and have reached 30 mastery, getting me in on challenges. Essentially challenges are timed dungoen rush missions that grant bonus rewards for completing enough quests in the specified time.   There are also plans to add another class soon along with inventory expansions (though the inventory expansions may be restricted to being purchased with currency that can only be obtained through spending real money). This may be a bit of an issue, but one way around this is to utilize club worlds (you can be a member (or owner) of up to 5) and the storage space granted by creating and using specail 'club chests' there.   If you were turned away by the queues before, I'd say give it a try now. They're still around, but not nearly to the extent of half-hour wait times as they were before. Devs are continuing to strive for a game that's fun for everyone, including free players, thankfully not caving in to unreasonable demands made by 'the ones that paid.'   There's still plenty of kinks, but the game continues to be thoroughly enjoyable.   ---Original 7/19/15 Review---  This is an amazing game and the Devs are working like mad to sort out the limited server space issues that cause long queues. Please be patient or at least come back in a few weeks as things get improved and fixed. In the meantime, they have been giving some free items to players who have had to deal with downtimes, to thank them for continuing to play the game in spite of downtimes.  The game is incredibly fun and well worth the wait, especially once you're able to turn off the in-game music so that waiting in the queue doesn't affect doing something else like watching stuff on youtube or listening to your own music. The music in the game is okay, but partially as a result of the queue, not worth listening to compared to having your own music playing. Personally I've found the OST from the Mother series to be quite fitting anyway.   I ramble, but the point is this is a great game that's just off to a rocky start. I really hope for it to succeed and encourage anyone interested to either put up with the queues and server downtime or just be sure to check back once things do smooth over.",

After this, I was bored, and stopped playing it. Alright, let's step back... Everything but the classes is pretty good in this game. Now, even the good parts of the classes makes it/them bad. The problem is, most of the classes are downright awesome. Why's this a problem? Because I end up not knowing which one to pick, and then pick two with a class coin, and get bored by trying to level the two equally. I've played about ninety hours of this at the point of making this. Oh, by the way, this game is practically p2w, except, you can play without that. This game isn't like others, 100% pvp, this is mostly pve, making pay to win not really all there. It's not winning, it's just taking your time, and progressing. Game's pretty good, after me taking a second look at it... But, again, classes. I've had to make how many accounts? I have made, drumroll... Five accounts. To make an account, you have to go through the process of making another email. So, thanks. That's made it a lot more annoying, and I end up switching between accounts because I don't even really know what class I want to play. Which is just me, making this game even better. Yes, you have to waste A LOT of time on this, but, once you get all your work and such done for the day, it's your time. You can waste as much time as you want on this. Anyway, probably... 8/10, in my current mood. Recommended... Hard.",

Sure you could get power leveled to 30, but then getting suitable gear is another grind in itself, and you miss out on gaining easy power score increase by skipping to the end.  Gameplay has remained steady for years - the only things that changed were new items added, making more to grind for. At first it was to level 20, now its 30, and special end game items.  You will need to play frequently to 'keep up' or fall into the loop of being behind, or worse, the 'Pay to catch up' aspect.  Trion is all about paid options, and Trove is no exception. Services that were free/limited are now strictly pay. It's not 'P2W' however as someone can pay $0 and still be 'End Game, Top Tier' - they just have to focus harder to do it.  I Recommend this game ONLY to those willing to put serious time into pointless grind. The 'bosses' are a joke, there is still no quest/story line after over 2 years, and all drops are completely random. Getting 'better gear' simply means grinding more, be it to craft them, or to find them and enhance them.  You will quickly fall behind on the 'current dragon unlock' unless you play everyday, even then you may not fully unlock the dragon before the next event starts - but at least you won't be paying nearly double resources after the event to fully unlock. (always focus on events going on - be they holiday specials or weekly, the items remain available afterwards except for event specific items)",

If you are looking for some chill time smashing blocks Trove is for you.

The servers (or server?) doesn't seem to work properly, even though they announced a server upgrade, it's usually laggy and it takes forever to join the game or even create your character, also you can't go to the same instance your friends are unless you invite them or they invite you. You can't just run the .exe to play the game, you must first install Glyph and open it from there, so what's the point to use Steam to download and advertise it? Level cap is under 50 and every class has only 3 skills, even Mages only have 3 spells, making it pointless to choose a class except for attack range. The whole RPG idea is destroyed when your money is used for absolutely nothing, you have to craft a lot, making this game a Modded Minecraft Server.

I was gathering materials, day after day just to build something to allow me entry into a new area. I never did manage to get enough.  Daily limited currency. Although the new tutorial quests made it a little easier to start off with cubits, you're still limited to 500 a day (1000 on weekends), where most items in the store cost anywhere from 5000 to 20,000 cubits (such as classes and potions).  Frame rate drops. I don't know how many others are affected, but it happens to me very often still. At times the game will slow down to a crawl or experience micro freezes, what makes it really annoying is how the camera will spin wildly into random directions.  As alredy mentioned by others, it's very repetitive. You enter a zone, find the nearest dungeon, kill one of the 3 or so possible bosses (they all look different, but there's only so many different AI types in the game), grab your 2 items reward and move on to the next dungeon. There's visual variety, but all those different dungeons are user submitted, some of which are really horrible to navigate.  If you're easily annoyed by such things, then skip it until it gets some improvements.",

            "review_text": "This game, well. Unfortunately I've been unable to play for a while because of work and other commitments. But I felt that this game deserves a review.  The game at a first look seems like it is designed for little kids to run around and whilst that is very true it also makes plenty of room for the more hardcore gamers.  You start the game with a class that you choose which is randomly generated. You can then choose your look at your pre built safe house which you can openly customise whenever the hell you want! By that I mean no one players house looks at all the same! (unless you've got two players that have just started) Like, you can edit and change every individual block and there's no limits either, resources are super easy to obtain and special blocks are a little harder but to build your basic safehouse you have a whole world of mineable blocks around you! and it doesn't end there. You can build where ever you are. It doesn't have to be in your designated safe house area. (of course it won't stay there, but you can build outside of the home area if you want. this is just another example of the kind of freedom you get in the game)   The combat is indeed repetative, but strangely satisfying! Like, you just don't get tired of it. Choose your class wisely as this is going to be your class for a while but shortly after playing into the game a bit you will be able to unlock anothe class until you eventually unlock all the classes. (don't get me wrong, at the start you can choose any class to start with) when you unlock all the classes you can seemlessly switch between any of the classes on a single account. I'm talking, you can be halfway through a dungeon and be like 'I'm bored of this class now' press the shortcut key and switch to another unlocked class on the fly!    The crafting on the game seems bottomless with tonnes of new amazing things you want to craft in the game giving you tonnes of new things to do, dungeons are easy to find and range from easy to difficult to clear and then you have shadow arena's which are even harder and require a team. Each have better or worse drops depending on difficulty, magic find and how lucky you are and everything contributes in one way or another to crafting.   and then there's the customisation! just to start, this game is very moddable. You can find all sorts of visual mods on the web, from HUD mods and armor mods and even the colour and effects of the visuals. But if you don't fancy messing around with the modding side of things you have unlimited options inside the game. You find some really amazing weapon with the best stats ever after completing a really hard shadow dungeon with your Neon Ninja. The only problem is that this badass weapon is a giant lollipop... Whilst some might like that idea, some might want a badass ninja with a flaming radient sword! By simply pressing C you can literally change the skin of your sword to any of the other weapons you've broken down previously in the game. I'm talking every sword you ever picked up from anywhere. If it has rubbish stats you still want to pick it up if it looks good. Chances are, you might not have the skin for it yet. So you can break it down to get the skin and of course some valuable flux (which helps you craft and serves as currency in the game)     Of course, it's not all rainbows and butterflies. On some days you can get unbareable lag (which gets better and better every day with constant communication from the devs I might add)   The trade system is something you will get into eventually in the game. This game is still in early days yet. But trade is literally tapping into trade chat and selling things the old mmorpg way (WTB 2 pentaforge) bla bla. And then to trade you have to teleport to the player you want to trade with (it's easy to do when you get the hang of it) and use a nearby trading post which is a tad buggy at times. I get the feeling and kind of hope that this is just a quickfix solution for trading until they decide to implement something more concrete into the game.    I can't really think of too many negative things about the game but what I can say is that the Positives most definitely outweigh the negatives!    Definitely worth a try, it's free so what you got to lose?",

Better turtorial, Its alright. but when it says go from getting a sky realm to forging something to getting level 30 mastery its kindof redic. OR when it says get a club, What if i dont want a club? Stuff like that shouldn't be there, its forcing people to ask in chat 100 times.    So, overall I recommend this game. but if your into less-grind games then don't. I understand alot of rpgs are grind, but its kindof dumb when its like this. And lasty they need to add things to do besides fishing, raiding and grinding.",

The problem is in how it is laid out, with there being nothing to do except do endless dungeons (read:grind for 20 hours) to get top- tier equipment. Or you can build up your home, which means you are not progressing whatsoever, so where is the point?   Pros:  Fairly fun if repetitive combat Good if not very inventive character/class design Nice building mechanics. Multi-jump system means you don't have to spend 20 years climbing something.  Cons:  Dungeons are variants of the same thing (there is always a boss, and always one of 2 variants on the boss depending on what zone you are in. Randomised world means there is no visible progression of players. Its takes far to long to get wings, which I think improve the game somewhat (just cos you can, y'know, fly around and make you home into a sort of gliding course) (it take about twice as long as i have played to get anywhere near the rank required for wings) Swapping classes puts you back on square 1 NO inventiveness on either boss or mob design. Classes are either spam 'n' pray or do massive damage.   TL:DR: This is a game that quickly gets old due to its totall lack of inventivesness.",

Customizing the characters based on what you pick up from enemies is a great touch too.

They need to add more content, it takes them a while to add content. Particularly the battle portal content for pvp will be fun but they need to imrprove on it and make it less simple. They should make it so you can attack other regions held by players (club worlds) and take some type of loot from other players. A war of Emperium style pvp sytem would also be great. They also should expand on the equipment such as adding sockets to items and mobs drop gems, souls, cards etc that are rare and can be socketed in the equipment.  With some updates this game could be really awesome.",

Already on the market there are Minecraft modpacks that are frankly easy to install and have met and well exeeded these standards. This is a game for people to poke around and find what type of playstyle they like. I do not concider it a full fleshed out game, much like the free version of Runescape.

Anyways, how would I rate the game then? 10/10 no questions asked! Now? 3/10  Trion seems to enjoy taking good games and ruining it with pay to win models and making it harder for the free players. Guess what they are doing to Trove? Making the classes unbuyable with cubits (in-game money). Well ain't that just what the doctor ordered! CLASSES YOU GOTTA PAY FOR WITH REAL DOLLARS. $$$ Whip out your wallets boys and girls! If you want new classes, ya gotta buy em. ALSO... a LOT of cubits items in the item mall have been increased in price! Why? To make you buy it with real life dollars OF COURSE! It's MUCH easier to spend $10 than to farm up 50,000 cubits! That's the Trion way. *thumbs up*  Yeah, Trove is fun with friends, but don't expect much as a free player. It'll only get worse from here.",

            "review_text": "Before you judge my review credibility from my hours played, I have played over 1000 hours of this game easy on Glyth before it was on steam. This game is a very very in-depth game but a causual player can also play this game. If you like grinding, you will like this game. But you don't need to grind to get good items. When you first start you probably will feel very behind and googling things like BEST CHAR IN TROVE???? and FASTEST WAY TO EARN FLUX? and no matter what I say you probably still will. Those guides can help but I think that the best character is just your preference which is why I think this game is so unique from other similar games because there is no dominate character that if you don't have unlocked you will be getting rekt from other more experienced players. This game is perfect for all players for that reason because you can play the game for 1000 hours like me and have all radiant gear or just play the game for a couple of hours and still have fun and get some nice shadow gear for yourself.  I used to play on a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ laptop and still get great frames so if your stuck playing on your moms mac, I think you will be fine. The mechanical requirements are very low which introduces the game to more causaul players that don't have access to monster computers.  A lot of the time I find myself grinding but not getting bored because there are a variety of different things that you might grind for. Like every hour there is a opportunity to partcipate in Hourly Dragon Quests which by the way is a great way to not get super bored while grinding on SA's all day.  There are in-game microtransactions but they consist of player skins that do not alter the stats of your character, blocks, and premium currency. The premium currency can be converted into Flux so people could pay to get Flux, but I do not reccomend doing so. Luckly there are no pay-to-win EXP potions or anything so you know that someone with a max character worked for it. Also another way of showing that you didn't pay for your items is Mastery Rank. I am mastery 200 which is max because I have spent a lot of time working for that. But when you come accross a level 20 mastery ranked player with 10 stacks of 9999 Flux you know he ain't legit.  I hope my review helped you realize that you should get into this game and it is not your average free-to-play game where you can just pay and become just as good as a player that has 1000 hours.

This makes trading with other players tedious as you must first travel to a trading post. You can now only store or destroy items. 2) There are too many benches. Crafting is a massive part of this game, but it's very annoying that you must craft a bench to craft a bench to craft a certain item. How about just one bench with a level-tier system for what you can craft? 3) The monetization is stupid. Yes, I know, Trion has to make money somehow, but making some items available only for those willing to pay real money is ridiculous. This is the same nonsense that's plagued F2P games for years. Surely Trion can be more creative than this.  That being said, Trove is still a really fun game. The crafting system is solid and the items are pretty cool.

I felt like I entered the game expecting it to BE minecraft with magic, but it's honestly very different. It's better in many respects, but only because it is centered around a battle/adventure format, and not around a survival/construction format. You don't have to survive or build shelter in this game, you go around destroying and pilaging. That isn't to say you CAN'T build, you can make a club world and expand and create within it, and your cornerstone is whatever structure you would like and it can come with you anywhere!  The one downside I would say is that the gameplay itself can get a little stale, and it becomes a grindy grind collectathon when you're trying to push the limits into the higher end items, and waiting for days at a time to get new classes can be SOOOOOOO BORING, but when you've gotten some headway, and you can transfer better items between classes, it becomes easier to stomach.

It takes about 10 hours if you're playing at a normal pace. Then you have to find gear --&gt; grind more dungeons (either for the actual gear or for in-game currency to buy the gear). This takes forever and is frustrating because you just want to play the end-game content. Then, and only then, can you do shadow tower dungeons, which are an underwhelming hack n' slash. Reflecting on the game, it has almost nothing to offer. It won't change your life. There's no storylore, no npcs with backstory, and the pvp is simply horrendous. There are MANY better mmorpgs out there.  That being said, I have logged over 50 hours thusfar and it was a F2P game, so I highly recommend it to waste time :D Thumbs up for sure!",

For example while writing this review i forgot what most of the tracks sound like. They may be not good but I was never bothered by the soundtrack.\\  Gameplay 8.5/10 The gameplay in this game is really fun it showcases show cases everything an mmo like it needs. It is quite simple with several different classes you can pick. There is a regular attack, powered attack, special attacks, and ect. There is certain gear you can craft for each of your classes and some gear can apply for multiple classes. Though crafting is not required to get powerful gear. Some boss monsters drop rare gear and there are dungeons that have a chest with two gear pieces if you beat them.  Overall 7/10 with the rating of play it ",

There is some building in the game but nothing to the extent of minecraft. the dungeons are pretty fun and the systems, while simple, feel good.  The one thing you NEED to know about this game is it is all about collection. There are classes that are all wonderfully unique, for you to collect (through play or with $), Class Skins, Mounts (three different kinds, 4 if you count dragons as unique), blocks, craftables, weapons skins, armor skins, fish, allies, etc...  This game is all about collecting everything. Sure it does it with a skin of combat and exploration but if you don't have interest in collecting shiney things Trove will be a fairly short lived diverssion.  That being said I have found collecting to be quite fun and am enjoying Trove immensly. The launch has been a bit rocky with server issues but the beta was super solid and I imagine once they get the kinks worked out the game servers will no longer have issues.

Pros: - not pay to win - combines RPG, MMO, Sandbox genres all together magically - DO NOT JUDGE THE GRAPHICS BASED ON SCREENSHOTS! this game is gorgeous. Although the art style is Minecraft-esk it still has some of the best lighting effects ive seen. There were times in game when my friend and i would be casually walking to a cave to mine recources when we would suddenly be so gobsmacked by the sunset, we would stand there and stare for a few minutes. Best part is, it is in no way graphically demanding of your PC. - Great class system - Randomly generated dungeons/worlds. What i mean is that the game is split into different areas based on difficulties. if there is no one in a area for 30 minutes it will be randomly re-generated. - club system. Each club gets there own island to do whatever they desire. - Easy to pick up, difficult to master. - Regularly updated - simple yet deep  Cons: - A few bugs, but thats expected in a game that just came out of release. - At times it may feel a bit grindy to get coins, but you really dont need coins. The only thing coins get you are different classes and fishing gear XD. - Severs may need to be optimized - there currently is not Auzzie server, but i expect on to come soon.  All in all, this game is great for free to play. I personally wouldnt mind paying $5 - $10 for it. I recomened this game to people who love MMO's, RPG's and sandbox games. In fact, this game has something for everyone. This game is from the creators of succesfull titles such as rift and Archage, so in my opinions, this game has lived up to that reputation.  8.5/10, 9/10 when bugs are fixed.",

It is like that game Cube World but with an MMO twist and not as many blocks to every thing. The game feels like a mix of Cube World and Minecraft. You can ethier build some pixal art or a sweet castle, or grind away in the many many many dungeons of the game. And gameplay is fantastic as well.

You can make friends, join clubs (or make one), raid dungeons, fish, ride a boat while shooting your cannon at your enemies, turn in to a dragon, ride a dragon, shoot from your guns and jump really high, fight Shadow Arenas, use swords, summon minions, use flasks to heal from the start of the game you start with 8 flasks, and much more! So start playing now and you'll get addicted and become a master of this game!",

            "review_text": "This is going to be hopefully a short review.  So I was a little sceptical about the game due to it's Minecraft-like graphics. Read some of the reviews and decided that I will give it a shot, since there were a lot of positive ones. I had nothing to lose, but I was still sceptical after all the positive reviews. So with my first log-in there was like... I can't even describe it. There were a lot of colors, it looked awesome. It looked so simple, you have about 4 spells ( excluding your basic attacks ) which are so simple made. There is no class advance and stuff ( even though you can change your class whenever you like, as long as you charge some real life money) Once I entered combat, the gameplay seemed so smooth, I couldn't believe my eyes. I feel that the live action combat system is very well made, and I might compare it to TERA's combat system, and even say that it feels a little smoother. The community is very, very friendly, so far. Whenever I asked any questions in the Global chat, they always answered me. After some time spent in the game, I found out that the game is not as simple as it seems. There are a lot of instances, and the end-game content seems to be quite good as well. There are a lot of different item grades, for different levels, there are item upgrades. Though there is a different side of the game. The even more minecraft-like. You can farm almost every color material that you see in the world. The world is completely destroyable. There are a lot of dungeons with different type of colored blocks. You can make your dream house, castle, hell you can even create a whole forrest! So far, so good. The only issues I've encountered are the from-time-to-time long server log-ins. Though it says exactly how much time you are supposed to wait, so it's not really a problem for me. The most time I've waited was about 30 min. Usually it is around 10 min, if there is any waiting. Overall the game seems to be very fun.    I hope I helped :)   PS. The Cash Shop is not an issue with the game, people who are using it don't have some kind of strong advantage in the game, so chill your tatas!   ",

My only complaint is that when I logon sometimes it will say 'Queue position 1000+ Expected Wait time 63 minutes' so my only option is to switch to another server that is half way across the world and gives me horrendous lag. Its annoying and I enjoy the game besides that.   In conclusion, the game is a good well rounded F2P but Trion, please upgrade your servers.

Trove is game that I would highly recommend trying at the very least considering that:  1) It's Free  2) It takes up very little space on your computer (short download time) 3)Seriously, it's free   But aside from that the real selling point of this game from my perspective is that 95% of the content in the game you can obtain through in game currency or earn by playing. The other 5% of the content that you can only purchase using real money is purely cosmetic and doesn't affect gameplay.   Classes? Play about 30 minutes a day (the time it takes to fill your quest bar) for a week and abracadabra you can unlock a new class of your choice.   Mounts? You start with one that is only 20 speed lower than every mount that exhists in the game, every week loot boxes obtained through play have a chance to drop 1 of 2 unique weekly mounts, 2 mounts have a random chance to drop as loot whenever. (There are also several mounts that can be crafted but the aforementioned ways are the easiest/fastest)  Allies/pets? Vendors sell them in boxes (in exchange for an in game earned resource) that randomly give you one of the allies in each set.   Wings? Reach Mastery Rank 20 (Collect styles, learn mounts, fish, level your character etc.)   Gameplay wise you may find it a bit grindy after a while, but hey its a dungeon crawling mmo what were you expecting? A Storyline akin to the elderscrolls games?   Easily one of the best practitioners of the free-to-play model to date",

There's a rather long tutorial line now that shows you the game, the different worlds, so you aren't lost when first starting the game. The combat/adventuring system is really nice with a lot of different classes to choose from. There are a lot of biomes with different monsters and player-created dungeons that change regularly! There's a lot to do in Trove. There isn't a mission or quest line, but you create your own adventure. There are boats, dragons, you can go fishing or fight monsters with various classes. You can customize each class with different styles you can save (there are A LOT of styles), but also different flasks and flask effects (emblems) make your class unique in the way YOU want to play it. Adventuring isn't the only part of the game though. You can build in club worlds with friends or create your own little home in your Cornerstone you can take anywhere with you. There are basically no limiations to your imagination.   Trove is a great game with (so far) weekly updates. Developers working closely with the community on their official forums.

Now, at 9:24a central time, I get a 1000+ queue position, but an estimated wait time of 6 minutes. Not too bad, I suppose, providing the wait time is accurate. I'm letting it continue while I'm typing this. And at almost exactly 6 minutes, I'm in.  Now that I've put some time into playing, and not just queues, this is an entertaining variation on the voxel based genre that Minecraft popularized. A little bit of RPG with the suvive and dig and build. Persistent building on your cornerstone, which is a 16x16 area that stretches from the bottom of the world to the build limit, I believe, and can be 'teleported' to any vacant cornerstone plot in any world. Different levels of sub-worlds scale the difficulty, and hub worlds which provide some community services and a safe area. Club worlds which are also persistent builds, but are not publically accessible unless someone with the necessary level of control opens it up to public access (not sure exactly how this works, haven't played with it much, at this point). Mulitple classes with varying abilities. A wide variety of equipment with a wide variety of stats and modifiers. I still feel like I'm just scratching the surface, but I think it's worth a look if you like the voxel world genre.  Update July 16, 2015: First time with something other than '1000+' queue order. 800 something, and relatively quickly went down. Estimated wait time said less than a minute, but I think it was a bit more than a minute. Still, it's better than 20 minuites, and definitely better than 580 minutes. I don't know whether it was the server update, or people just getting fed up with the queue times. I did actually get some gameplay in, and it is an engaging game. I'm going to see how the queue times stack up for the next few days.  Update July 15, 2015: 580 minute queue time.  July 14, 2015: At this point in time, all I've seen are queue times ranging from 20 minutes to 200 minutes the few times I've tried to play. I can't recommend something like this. I frequently have limited time to play games, I'm not going to spend it sitting in a queue. I'll keep trying to get some actual gameplay time, but until I do, it looks awesome, but I can't recommend it unless you've got the time and patience to wait for it.",

They made the same mistake they did with ArchAge, and didn't prepare for so many people to play it.

            "review_text": "I have played the game since early beta, and honestly it is what most people wanted from another product called: Cube World. The real benefit is it has grinding elements, with a levelling system up to level 20. The grinding isn't that bad, so for the more casual player it won't be like say, Diablo 3. But there is still a grind to get gear. The skills are very simple, one passive, and three skills. One skill is your M2, the 1 key, and your ultimate the 2 key. It is reasonably basic, and let's you get involved with the game sooner.   The economy is... Strange, it tends to be wonky and change rapidly with updates(Like most games). Most things in the shop can be bought with a currency called 'Cubits'(These are completely seperate from the unofficial currency of Flux and can NOT be traded.). You earn these every day from a daily system, you do enough dungeons and it gives you 500 on weekdays and 1000 on weekends. You also get them from a tutorial system, a few thousand at least to help you out. Potions are probably the only p2wish part of the game, considering that you need to earn the cubits in order to get the emblems for the potions to add addition effects, but the health regained is the game.  Classes are earned through this same Cubits system, and each cost about 5,000, with the newer classes being 8,000. Each class is unique, with some being tankier than others, and others being complete glass cannons that rely on not being hit to deal enormous damage. That being said, there are some cons to the game. Being a smaller game before Steam, the servers aren't the best. Right now they are working on getting more of them into the game, and working on optimizing the game, so it's a bit crashy and laggy at this time. It is also run off of another client called Glyph, some of you may remember a game called Archeage(Ironically having a bit of the same launch). However it DOES retain the things that steam offers, such as saying you are playing trove, and also giving you that delicious, delicious overlay that steam offers.  All in all, it kicks the pants out of most F2P games at this point, totally free to play. You don't need to buy ANYTHING in the game to progress at any point, it's a pay to progress faster game.",

Has a few microtransactions that speed up the grinding which is the biggest flaw (i understand that most MMORPGs are like this). This grinding really makes you want to buy credits to speed things up wich isnt the way to go. However overall it has a good impression on me. It made me happy for a good 90-100 hours so far.   I would definately reccomend this game. Its great and Easy to understand.  After playing for a while it slacks off a bit tho, even if you dont have everything, its the pure nature of MMORPGs which is grinding. It starts fun but gets dull soon after.  It would jump from IMO to 10/10 if it had fun grinding all the way through.",

If you're looking for Voxel MMORPG that isn't dead, search no more!  Pros:  - tons of equipments! - break equipments for its skin (you can use sword A with skin from sword B) - With that feature above, costumization possibilities is limitless. - collecting items never been this fun! - Majority of items and equipments you will find is community made. Yes, that means you can make one, submit it on trove subreddit, if the dev thinks your creation is cool, they will put it in game. - Dungeons and lairs are also community made. - Double jump? pfft. How about 15x jump? - lots of classes. - Build your own house, find furniture recipes, create your dream house. Your house isn't stuck in one place. All over the world, there are many 'cornerstones'. When you saw an empty one, you press E on the sign, and your house is moving to your new cornerstone. Very convenient feature, really. You can play 24 hours without needing to go back to the hub. - Many biomes. Each biomes has loots that matching the theme of the biome (example, in desert biome, you'll more likely seeing wild wild west themed loot, in icy region, you'll find ice themed loot, etc)  Cons - As for now, queue times. - Sometimes, the grindfest is unbearable. - Some enemy are just reskin of another biome. - End game content needs to be more interesting.",

There's also a crafting system, which I haven't gotten too deep into yet, but it looks fairly straight forward, which gives it the Minecraft feel. Instead of having hundreds of specific blocks, they made the landscape out of Primal Blocks of each color, so there's no searching for sandstone or oak wood or whatever you do in Minecraft these days. There're special ores and other crystal/shard/soul blocks that are needed for certain patterns, but they're easily found throughout the world.

I honestly hated it when it was in Alpha, it was boring, had little content (which I expected from alpha) and there only 3 classes I am fairly sure.  DISCLAIMER: I will not be ranting about queue times, as it's not a very big deal. Reviews are reviews for the games GAMEPLAY, not server complications that will be fixed a few weeks after launch. It is wrong to review a game based on how stable it is the first week of it's launch. The devs do not know what can happen.  Most of that has changed, and for the better.  Trove really encourages and reward both creativity and exploration, and gives you many ways to build and explore in all the different worlds that are in fact, randomly generated by players as they create new worlds.  Creativity: Trove provides many ways for players to show how creative they are, including, -Cornerstones where you can build in a small area and freely move them around while exploring. -Club (Guild) worlds where you can build anything you want as big as you want it. -Can turn primal blocks into almost any color. (Once you find the recipes) -Not sure if this was limited to Alpha founders packs, but most equipment in the game was made by players. -Many cosmetic options to make your character look the way you want them to.  Exploration: Trove allows players with a mind for progression dig in on a feast, -Large amounts of loot to collect. -Dungeons are found almost everywhere; there is no shortage of things to fight. -There are many difficulty tiers that you will not reach the end of for a long time. -LOTS of classes that will fit different roles and playstyles. -Many biomes in the world to explore.  Cons: -A fair bit unoptimized, but it was even worse in alpha. -Starts to feel a bit grindy after playing for 5 hours straight. -No party system in a modern MMO? Okay then. -A community filled with 10 year olds and illiterate trolls  All in all Trove is a very fun game. I highly suggest you play it if you like the freedom that Trove provides.",

            "review_text": "Ok this isn't my style to do reviews so sorry if I miss a few key points or leave some stuff out. Trove is a minecraft like game with a huge focus taken away from survival and more towards battleing monsters, clearing dungeons, and working together. At the time of writing this, there are 11 very different classes of warriors to choose from. To make it easier to pick out the good and the bad here, these are the pros and cons I have found so far:  Pros: Huge worlds to explore- When I say huge I really mean huge, as if each world is the size of a continent. Lots of loot- I have never come across two items with the same stats besides items you craft, which leads to the next pro. Craft a wide variety of items and blocks- These help you progress even further into the many world of Trove OR help you work together with friends to build eachother up. Shared Loot- The loot you see is yours to take, and any blocks or dropped items in a pretty ample area of your warrior are duplicated and given to each person close enough to recieve them. Someone mines 5 blocks and there are 4 people close by, 25 blocks are distributed evenly to the players so each recieve the full amount, and this is another big reason to play in large groups. Class changes- Most games with different classes require you to have a seperate character for each class. Trove gives you full access to EACH CLASS as you unlock them. Want to switch to your knight? Go to the world spawn point or if you crafted a class change block at your home and change, it is that easy. Mobile Home (so to speak)- Your home, called a Cornerstone, can be relocated seamlessly to any available plot in any world your in. Want to store items in your chests at your Cornerstone but its far away, its much closer than you think. Find an empty plot, claim it, and there you go your Cornerstone is right in front of you in a matter of seconds. No cost to relocate, no penalty, no cooldown, your home goes with you so long as you find a plot to summon it.  Cons Queue time- This is the one true con that I dont like to see. Queue times of over half an hour just to get in game. HOLD IT, before you stop reading and say 'I can't wait half an hour to play.' hear me out. This 30 minute wait is only temporary and isn't consistant. It is entirely possible to do something else while you are waiting. Watch something on Youtube or grab a quick bite to eat, or better yet anticipate when you want to play and start the queue early. It is worth the wait, trust me. Now to less crucial con I found. What am I doing?- There are some concepts that aren't explained in the tutorial/missions that can confuse newcomers. My example of this was buying a new class at the store (which is accessible anywhere as well with the press of a button). I bought a new class and it changed me to the class but I was lost. Do i have to start over now, I can't use any of the loot in my inventory because its too high level now. While this can be frustrating just use your head or reach out in the chat. Because I felt the confusion that new players are in I always respond to questions whenever I see them. Trove is about teamwork so don't be afraid to ask for help.  This sums up my experience of Trove. It is a DEVELOPING GAME, so don't be so hard on the dev team just because they didn't anticipate Trove becoming so popular. They are human, not fortunetellers. Also, Trove is Free to Play so what do you have to lose? What are you waiting for, get into Trove and GO EXPLORE.",

            "review_text": "The thing that keeps me playing Trove is how easy it is to gather a group and go co-op mode.  I made a club, and any time someone asked to be invited to a club over the general chat channel I immediately invited them. Since the game offers a quest which rewards joining a club early in the experience, players are always asking. Within a few days the club has grown big enough that there are always clubmates online, so I never have to run solo if I don't want to. Alternately, you can enter a certain chat channel by typing '/join adventure' which exists for people to coordinate and party up. Just decribe what you want to do in that channel and generally a player or two will ask to join you.  The game makes it easy to cooperate with other players by permitting instant teleportation to any friend or clubmate, and players can also invite others to join them for specific encounters, notably the shadow arenas.  The only complaint I have at this point (since we can certainly expect the queue times will continue to decrease untill they are gone entirely) is that the fast paced dungeon runs of a typical Trove party can leave a player behind if they enter chat to try to communicate. I hope we will see a VOIP feature or a Teamspeak server or something to allow more rapid communication.  Actually, I will add another thought to this wishlist. It can be hard to move in large groups, say four or more, because there can only be eight players on a world at a given time. That means that even if I and my friends want to join a clubmate to farm a specific resource, if the world is full we won't be able to join it. I'd like to see a way for groups of four to eight people to be able to move from world to world as a party.  Anyway, Trove is only getting started. I'm looking forward to seeing what awesome stuff the devs- and the community content creators- will come up with next.",

Since it looks like this game has been around more then a year, it feels to me like an early acess game with its lack of content. They have Professions and the only ones available are Gardening, Ringcrafting, and Fishing, which each are as they sound by there name and are ok but still feel lacking in someways.  Hard to say if i actually do recomend or not depends what a person is looking for, this game is a quick causal burn of a game that is best played with a good group of buddies, but after a few hours the game gets stale as there is not much to do after awhile,   When i first saw this game i dispised the art style, i really didnt like how little detail there was in the blocks around the world but if you look at your own characters hair there has more voxel resulotion, this put me off but i gave this game a fair chance and im glad i did since once you can get past the small imperfections of how it looks its not a bad game.",

I would say there is upward of at least 1500+ loot items in game. It's one of those games you start playing and just can't stop. The feeling after killing a boss and wondering what he will drop is uncomparable. And the blocky Minecraft-esc style means that even people with low end computers can run this game at 30 FPS or more.

However, due to large amounts of players, there is a long queue time before actually playing (~30 minutes). When you grind, it feels very singleplayer, and if you do raid the dungeons with other people, you get less exp, so it is unpreferable.  Fun game, recommend for MMO lovers. 30 minute queue.  P.S.

At times you may be waiting for a good 20-30 minutes to get a slot. And as the server get's packed with more people, the game starts to slow down. You may even get disconnect due to the server being overloaded.   You may also encounter certain bugs in the game which needs polishing up real bad. Dev's are probably working on them as we speak. Give them a chance.  If any of this is not a big concern and you are patient enough, then by all means, Play This Game!",

Most bad reviews i see are those who dislike waiting, they have nothing bad other then wait times and such to say about the game so let me make a nice little pros and cons.  Pro ------------------------ Easy to learn Simple yet fun crafting system. Combat is quite polished. Ingame items are cool some times flat out wacky showing a fun sense of humor. Classes can be unlocked via log in bonuse (gold coins). Free updates almost monthly. -------------------------- Con --------------------------- Costume colors are locked behind money currency. Community is a bit toxic but thats every mmo now days. Server log in times (hopefully fixed soon) Game randomly crashes form time to time due to glyph launcher being crud. --------------------------- This is what i gathered as i watched the game grow, if you want a simple game to play while you relax then look in to trove. If you want a game that will become your full time mmo then i recomend finding something else but keep this for those days you do not feel like raiding and such.",

You run around increasing your level while attacking bosses in dungeons. But there are other things to do other than fighting, such as fishing, crafting, sailing, and other things. Trove has a bunch of classes to choose from, such as gunners, ninjas, ice mages, fire mages, and fairies. There is a downside to this, if you are going to stay a free player, you have to keep playing for a couple of days to unlock just 1 class. It can take more than a week just to get 1 class.   There are a couple of downsides to this game that makes this review into a negative one. You may have seen it around, but the queue. GOD ♥♥♥♥ING CHRIST.

            "review_text": "Where as Minecraft is about exploration, survival, crafting, decorating and creating your own bulidings or art projects (and for some people programming and music projects), Trove is more about fighting, mini-dungeon crawling, player progression through weapons, clothing items, RPG leveling and LOOT. Crafting as more of an after thought. You do need to find materials to make items in the world as in Minecraft but it isn't really the feature that sticks out in my mind when you play this. Crafting is more or less the thing you do so you can get even more loot to upgrade your character instead of for survival and to make your time trying to exist in the game easier. In that way Trove is essentially Destiny with a Minecraft skin on top. You'll repeatedly do the same tasks and dive into the same but only slightly different dungeons over and over again so you can get your loot and upgrade your character. The loot you get is in itself random so every time you get an item or defeat a dungeon boss it's like gambling. I somehow struck 777 on the 'slots' during my time playing and got a super rare and expensive Tron Bike. Another way to put it is that this is a game that relies on Skinner Box to keep players hooked, where it apparently succeeds based on the number of people I've seen playing.  It's a nice game to waste a little time with, but for me it holds no redeeming value beyond that. I never got the feeling like I was being challenged or that I was progressing in anything beyond character progression with no story or really a point to what I was doing being made clear. That sounds like the same kind of criticism you could put for Minecraft but playing Minecraft has always been more like a 'Zen Garden' thing I like to do when I feel like it. It's something I do to keep me calm with moments of excitement thrown in. Trove throws all that Zen stuff out the window to focus only on pretty mediocre action mechanics and in doing that it loses all appeal to me.  If this game is going to be more action and loot oriented it could at LEAST have a story to it to keep me interested so I know what I'm fighting for like in every other dime a dozen online massively multiplayer online game they throw at you for free on the internet. It feels like I was just being set loose in a randomly generated block world simply to beat up monsters to get loot and do other things just to get more loot to upgrade my character. The game doesn't bother to tell you everything you need to know about your character's fighting abilites (it does most, but not all) or how to find the items you need around you and just EXPECTS the player to go to a Wiki. Minecraft pretty much expected players to go to a wiki, but Minecraft started from a single group of people's website as an in beta indie project that didn't reach a major release till much later. It was already widely known from many sources that you needed to use a Wiki for information. Trove was released as a full game on Steam with dedicated servers and as a complete project, not as a work in progress like Minecraft. It just pretentiously expects you to go to the Wiki right off the bat with no hint that you should even look at one.  If you're the kind of person who likes 'stuff' and getting 'stuff' is the main thing that keeps you interested in video games, then you'll like this game because 'stuff' and being important because you have more and better 'stuff' than the other person is the main point of this game. Otherwise, if you're looking for something really exciting with some amount of depth, with a small story or something calm to do, you may be better off looking elsewhere. Also, good luck if your friends are a higher level than you and more interested in this game than you because due to monster difficulty levels you can't join them without getting slaughtered. Joining you would probably be boring unless they make a new character that is around your level. Pretty much once they've sunk more time into this game than you, you'll probably never see them very often even though you're both playing at the same time.  Trove feels like a very very striped down flashier version of Minecraft to me that takes out all the things I enjoy to focus on the things I'm kind of ok with but don't really enjoy that much.  There's a reason this game is called Trove. As in Treasure Trove. It's all about the Loot which ironically will all be gone when they eventually stop supporting this game.  On the plus side when you get loot in the environment it can't be taken by the other people in your party. Every person gets their own loot.",

The good thing with trove is the fact that this isn't just a grinding grade destroyer, but has many other options to choose from. You can build, similar to minecraft but slightly different, in your cornerstone (mobile house) or a club world (basiclly a guild). The club is, personally, my favorite part because you get to meet many different people, such as kids asking for a spare penta if I have one or those who are of your age or older that could help you out. (Btw no one will ever give you a free penta). When you get bored of the club activities or gain a high level you can mess around in the market which is, for me at least, interesting due to the changes of prices with the new releases. Overall this game is a load of fun and I would recommend this game to every age group possible.",

Glyph updating system is the enemy of Norton [blunt]. The Glyph's files are considered a serious threat by norton, the solution in the past was to whitelist the downloaded content of Glyph. This would work normally if you download the game trove off the internet, which requires you to go download a seperate file from Glyph to let you play it. Thus the file of Glyph Exists. BUT in regards to Steam the program isn't needed...is what i like to say but the program is downloaded through Steam .... Meaning the File needed to be Whitelisted doesn't exist on your computer but in Steam. So when trying to update Glyph a seperate program that's been saved in Steam will try to update.... then Norton kicks in and stops it causing a loop when click on Trove's Icon the Glyph update starts up and then is quickly brought down by norton... the process repeats [Explanation]. An old solution that i'm not sure if its gonna be implement is that Trion would send the Glyph update to Norton to be whitelisted and then Norton would send an update to Norton users.... I dunno why no one is doing it, its not my field of expertise unfortunately....  Thus, I highly advise the readers of this review to take this with a few grains of salt, since I know I don't have all the answers in regards to this...   What saddens me the most though is that i won't get to play the game... I won't get to try these adventures into the game further... I want to play... but i will wait until my subscription is over or ... go download Glyph from the site and hope it crosses over... The game is awesome, the incompatibility sucks!!!!!

            "review_text": "First seeing this game, I saw it as minecraft and roblox had a baby. Now with some decent hours on it... its more like it's own thing. It's quite an intriguing spin on the olden style F2P(Free 2/to play) MMO with classes, in game currency, and a CRAP TON of things to do. To really describe this game... kind of requires a glazed over walk though. It's a 3d building MMO, what did you expect?   It starts out with dungeon-ering about with your first pick of a class, whatever it may be of the doesens of classes to choose from. It really breaks down into ranged or melee, and it's obvious who is who in that respect. There mildly hidden Info icon that looks like a small green button usually in the bottom left corner, which is something you will need consistently. It tells you general info on the general play style and skill names of the class. With your class picked out... the rest for about 13 levels is lots and lots of dungeons. Once you get enough cubits from daily playtime, you should be able to buy something in the in game store. You could buy health potions, new classes, mounts, emblems, (Which are passive equipable buffs) and allies. (Which are equipable pets, also with buffs) Generally what you want to do is increase your overall level, or mastery levels. This is done by doing things such as leveling up the different characters, or classes, learning new recipes or finding new items. Much past that... its up to you to do what you want. There are specific areas you get certain things for crafting and so forth, but that is more of a side note, even though it's a large part of the game! There's gardening, ring crafting, rune forging, reforging, ya-da ya-da bla bla bla, you get the idea.  To cut the crap, the following are the bare essentials to know.  PROS: *Expansive, with the constant updates this is no visible end to the content within this game. AKA: LOTS of playtime, for FREE! *Easy to learn combat with some genuine difficulty sprinkled on top *Easy time killer... no... MURDERER game. Still for free! *Great sound track and unique graphics *Your general dungeon crawling home can be moved with the press of a button *The building mechanics in game are exceedingly expansive. *You can craft yourself an entire WORLD to build in and to share with your friends... with enough resource grinding ---If you really enjoy it, there is always the premium mounts, costumes, and inventory expansions, those being VERY USEFUL. You run out of inventory awful quick with all the different things in this game. CONS: *Very repetitive if played for more than an hour or so in one sitting *None of the alternate things to do are heavily encouraged, they are really side quests when compared to dungeon crawling. *Building is neigh non-existent in the normal world, seeing as whatever you build outside of your set house, seeing as anything you build outside of it can and will be destroyed. *Your created worlds don't have ores in them, or any wide range of biomes. Those you have to craft. Yes... CRAFT your world's biomes. *Server side issues like you wouldn't believe, they are bound to be fixed in a reasonable amount of time *It's in early access, so there is going to be no shortage of bugs, glitches, and crashes. Shocking. I would say this game needs a fair dosage of work.   BUT HEY! ITS FREE!! That means a thumbs up from me! ",

            "review_text": "Okay, 20 hours in, i think nows a good time to write up a review! So let's get into it.  Pros:  Sandbox, some may call this minecraft, others, cubeworld, but overall, this is not that much a clone in all honesty, it has it's own sandbox elements that make it differ from the famous mojang creation, other then digging a hole and less then simple crafting.  Combat, This i usually don't find much in games like this, warframe and blackdesert sure! but a sandbox? nah... well i would be lieing if i continued the debate against it, this is'nt the best combat obviousely, but it's still pretty good! in a Cube world-sec sort of combat, but still keeping to it's own style (If that makes any sense, and if not, It's action combat, but surprisingly non clunky in my opinion).  Crafting, I'll admit, not the BEST, but you don't have to be the best to be good, and this catagorizes as such atleast. looking for blueprints CAN get tedious at times, but this is an exploration game, which brings me to-  Free roaming, this is a game with not one, but nearly infinite worlds, dungeons, ares, and this game is still getting updates, so we Might be able to expect more biomes some time in the next year (It's currently december of when i'm writing this).  Classes, this game has 14 claasses currently (Maybe 15, i may have miscounted after the cloromancer's release) and each one you can play, For free... yep, FREE, no pay to win here in classes, you want to play as a knight? go ahead! the mage? just which element? a rogue? sci fi or old days? i'm certain you get the idea here, the only thing you have to do after you decide to switch is buy (with earned in game currency or bought premium currency) the class you desire.  Customization, one of the best perks in any game for me, not required, but it's always great to see a good system! in this case, it's a little 'lackluster' in some cases, but in other's, a mask and hat system, wings, a pet (or buddy), and even the skin of you'r weapon, Again, no buy to customize either!  Homes and Clubs, a.k.a, you get a plot of land, that of which may be brought up with a picket sign, that of which are scattered all over the many maps of Trovia(?), and within that space, you build WHATEVER you want, both Up and down, dig and build up whatever! and as for the clubs? this is where you and some friends get a whole iseland to yourselves, for the same purpose! (just becareful who you invite into the club...)  Events, many games have these, in this ones case, it's for new items, seasonal, christmas, halloween, valintines day, the usual.  Player made content, yes, that's right, this game DOES infact have this, not like TF2 or warframe where most you have to pay for, you just go out, and Find them! like any form of in game loot!  Resources, you know how in vanilla minecraft, you only get ONE iron ingot from one iron ore? and only ONE person get's it? does this annoy you? Me too (For those who answered yes), this game, resources are NOT light weight as such, just one persons digs up the ore, and anyone near it get's 1-2 of the said ore! and i mean you could have like 10 poeple close by and they get a share! (Not sure if it's actually 10 people, but to the point, multiple people gain from the ore block's breaking, as long as they are close by.)  Stats, and this one i add just because, certain stats effect things like double jumps (Jump 16 times in the air!?), Run speed, health and energy regen, a few things you would expect and other's you would have never thought of! (Unless you've played older games like oblivion and morrowind, in terms of jump height and speed...)  now the Cons:  Cash store, it IS unfortunate that this rose does have some thorns, and there ARE some things that can only be bought with REAL money, not that much to make it anywhere NEAR a deal breaker, but still...  Now the Nuetrals:  The Graphics, my opinion? Could be better, but atleast it's no minecraft clone... unfortunately, some may it it as otherwise just a mmo version of Minecraft, But i'm not gonna ask for them to change it, especially considering that those who KNOW this game, KNOW that it's NOT just another minecraft/cubeworld clone.  Repeats, by this i mean, you can easily learn the lay out of dungeons, the patterns and movesets of enemies, ect, yes this game does have plenty of variety, but this can get a little too easy after a while.  Story, short description, there is no story, you get in, do the tutorial (1-4 minutes) and then do whatever you want, some may see this as good, others may say 'What's the point with no story?', overall, i don't mind, it's just up to the player as to what they want to do...  So this game i have to say, is pretty Good considering what it brings, as a blunt way of saying it, it's a game where you go killing things for some resources, dig up others, and build you'r way up, metaphorically and literally, to be whatever class, whatever house, castle, tower, guild, clan or whatever! trove is a Sandbox, and you and every other player is the one building whatever you want!",

Cons: - Servers aren't good, lets be honest. - PvP needs a lot of tweaking; also because of servers being bad, you can't fully enjoy PvP. - It gets kinda repeatitive after hitting max level(charatcer level). - There are some unfixed bugs that might annoy you a little bit. - Not the best game for people who want to be recgonized/have some e-prestige/compete(competing in PvP matters, or having the best Club because how good they are in PvP) - There are no Club wars yet.",

This is more of the RPG MMO type of game. Its very family friendly and casual. Right now, as of 12/2/15 there are a lot of changes going on, like the battle arena. If you like a game that will host events, or once in a while give free items, you'll like trove. Also, you can spend real money on this game, however, a good thing about this game is: You don't have to spend money to be good at it, or get rare items. Last but not least, the plot system is amazing. When you're in a world and need your house, you can just go up to a plot area (They're everywhere) and claim it, and your house pops up.  However...  Past the 10th level you tend to have to grind for items and chests, etc.  There have been many complaints recently about the game being down for developement or maintenence, and it being hard to download. If you want to play this prepare to have to sign up for glyph, and to sign in when you want to play the game.   Also the lag may be a downer for some people. You can change this a bit by going into the video settings.  ~~ Overall I think this game is worth it for everyone, as long as their computer can handle it and they're willing to wait a bit before playing (For downloads, sign ups and e-mail verification) Once you get past those things this game is the best.",

To keep it as short as possible, here's a few reasons off the top of my head about why I can't recommend Trove anymore:  - Classes are pretty much impossible to get without paying real money, while before they could be purchased after a couple weeks of spending an hour a day in the game. - Dragons, which are essentially exclusive items with 'stages' like allies and mounts that switch out every month or so, have gone through serious downgrades: while before you could unlock every stage easily by spending a couple hours playing every day, you can now only get *one* stage of dragons for far more work, or through buying dragons for premium currency. - The Trion staff are an absolute joke, especially their support teams. You can see more than enough evidence for this in the popular reviews. - Content has been progressively getting more and more sparse, and the first real update we've gotten in months is a paid, or at least completely pay to win, expansion. Seriously, just read through the Mantle of Power DLC and tell me that doesn't give people a HUGE advantage.  I'd keep going, but it's 10:30 PM for me and I'm way too tired to care about Trion's latest screwups. Stay away from this game. It'll only get worse before it dies for good. ",

The game lags sometimes and its way too bad. 3. I dont think theres any good resources in this game. 4. WHATS THE POINT!!!  Even with this flaws its a great coop system and battles take stradegy wich is fun to plan. Boss battles may be too extreme but once you know the patern its starts to get more amazing. Also I've never seen a game like this before wich made me have fun with friends before (I dont like playing with them too much).   BUT!!!! theres one more thing!!! Playing alone on this game is depreasing and annoying, its not as fun as playing with friends.",

I see it as more a time waster and well I do not guarantee that you'll be playing it for a long run or a lot either however it was great playing it overall and I don't know have much of any complaints other than having devs listen more carefully to it's growing community. 6-7/10",

The developpers made a good job in adding more late game content, with now max lvl at 30, introduction of power gems, stellar equipment, u9 worlds, Ultra mode Shadow tower. I feel like i can always play this game.  If you liked Minecraft, and you like mmorpg with farming, such as runescape, this is for you!  Many people dislike the pvp system, but I find myself to enjoy it! They balanced it but making everyone OP, so everyone one shot everyone. But you still gotta be the one dodging everything to win.  I also think this game is not Pay to win, but paying gives you a great advantage in grinding WAYYYY faster. If you are patient, wait for weekly bonus, make your money by minning and completing hourly quests, you will in the end be just the same as any paying member.  The different style of the item, the huge variety of mounts, the possibility of having 30 jumps, is what makes this game beautiful and unique.   Hope to see you guys in the global chat soon!",

There's something in Trove that just pulls you in and makes you want to keep playing, even though it's a complete grindfest. I believe it is the playful and casual yet hardcore and time-consuming approach of the game.   I started playing with a couple of friends who immediately got stuck in it. At LAN-parties, the only games we played were Trove and some Csgo in between just to have a little break. I mean, we were seriously enjoying the game. Little did we know Trion were about to f*ck sh*t up.   Everything was great until Trion slowly patched some new things into the in-game store. For example classes now costing credits instead of giving you a choice to either buy it with cubits or credits. I was lucky enough to have played for so long i managed to get all the classes without having to pay a cent because Trion sh*t out class coins back then.    Mantle of power",

So I will transcribe my experience with Trion and Trove with this review. I DO NOT recommend anyone pick up and/or play this game unless you enjoy grinding for hours on end without really getting anywhere or you have some serious cash to drop on it. The entirety of the game has basically become P2W.  The Developers seem to care, but I'm under the impression it's an act because any time I make a post criticising them, they ban me on the forums, nor do they actually listen to the player suggestions/concerns. They keep you in the dark about most any and everything until everyone has gone completely scare-mongering everywhere. They are, as many have said before, incompetent. I don't dislike them as people, but they're playing accountant instead of developing a game.  Every patch we get more and more content locked behind paywalls or removed for free players entirely, and while I can put up with the grinding I CANNOT put up with more and more content being locked behind payment methods, not to mention their plethora of packs, one of which includes early access to a patch that doesn't do much for the fun of the game as much as it makes players want to buy more inventory space (gems and gem dust will take up most of your inventory, not even getting started on the boosters).  You'd think Trion would want to make more money properly, by listening to the players that actually care about the future of this game, but I'm not one of them anymore. There is no forseeable good future for this game anymore, it's the next Archeage. Which, speaking on ArcheAge, the gem system is just the good ole' regrade system minus the chance of the item being lost completely.  The lag is also ungodly. Rubberbanding and world generation taking forever galore. They stated they made improvements for MoP, they might've made some slight ones, but nothing noticeable was done to fix those issues, not completely their fault but they definitely have enough people still buying their ♥♥♥♥ to afford to take care of it.  I can't justify their gem packs that come with MoP early access, it's not much of an expansion to be worth purchasing a pack that includes early access to it unless you really want those boosters and items in it. Or any of their decisions with item mall items and other actions they have taken. Oh yeah, almost forget to mention the game is heavily reliant on RNG, as much as any other Trion game now.  Finally, the devs have a serious lack of communication and/or miscommunication causing uproars/ doomsdayers/ etc to cause a ruckus before they finally give us some small response that barely answers anything we've asked them.  Watch them ban me for making this review, it's what Trion is good at. I didn't want to have to write this review but I'm sick of being banned for speaking my mind and trying to push the game into a positive direction. I'm not wasting anymore time with it. I had fun at first, Trion, but you ruined it for me with your ♥♥♥♥ decisions, heavy-handed monetization, and squashing anyone who criticizes your decisions on the forums with a ban.",

Don't buy anything like that until you're far in the game (~uber-3) and have a viewpoint on if you actually like the game. don't waste your money and then realize that you don't really like the game.

            "review_text": "Ok, so Trove is a good game. Quite good for its kind, in fact. Is it P2W? No. You don't need real money for more classes. People sell class coins (the things you use to get classes) in the auction house. You unlock that by getting mastery lvl 10. Paying really doesn't give that much of a bonus. The best thing (and in my oppinion the only thing you should buy if you buy something is patron. The other stuff is really just Random Number Generated luck based stuff. (Also known as RNG or chance)     Now, here is where RNG comes into play. RNG can play a big part in this game. If you want the coolest items in the game, you rely on boxes and your luck. Now these items im talking about are by no means the best items in the game. However, if you are one of those lucky people, those items can give you nice bonuses.    Now, the grind. The most dreaded part for most players. Once you get to Uber-1, thats when you really notice the grind to start appearing. However, your luck can easily be raised by something called 'Magic Find'. This has a chance to raise the stat of a random item in one of the dungeon chests you just opened. Magic Find is a stat that can appear on gear, gems etc. Also, special items and pets can increase it. Patron will also give you a nice boost to magic find if you are willing to put a bit of money into the game.   Now, the 3 main currencies. (For new players that dont know, glim that you get for various stuff is maining only for water travel and fishing) Okay, now flux. You get flux for doing a lot of stuff. Deconstructing, selling, doing dungeons, etc. It is a grind for a lot of flux. However, early/mid game can usually get most of the flux by deconstructing and opening boxes. Now, flux is used for just about everything that is not in the credits &amp; cubits store, which i will get to right now. Every day you will get 500 cubits if you just play a little. Cubits are used for various things in the store, some more usefull than others. Now, Credits. You will get very few of these from the regular game. You get most from paying money. Most the stuff that you buy with them though, as I said earlier, really just isnt worth your money.    Finally, my rating of the game. I give it a solid 8/10. There are some tweaks that need to be made, yet there are still constant patches, updates, and sales. Of course, there is that every Friday stream that can give you rewards. Now, excuse me, i have to go play some more Trove.",

I love this game. It is open world like minecraft, with different randomly generated bioms with alot of dungeons to explore. Inside them you can find hats, masks, weapons and scripts. Cornerstones also give you the possibility to make a own home or base in that area. If you collect scripts, you can get new crafting recipes or blocks to use.   Pros: Really addicting Fun with friends NOT P2W Getting club worlds is really fun if you have some players to build in it. Active Community You can change the skins/models of items but still keep the stats Since there are alot of crafting recepes, you gonna play a long time to get the items. Frequent updates!   Cons: Like said above, this game is based on grinding for Items/materials. You gotta decide if thats a bad or good thing. There isn't a skilltree. The only way to change your stats is by collecting different loot and level up. Longer Sessions can get boring. Shadowtowers and shadowarenas are probably the only ways to actually use strategy and not simply holding the mouse button and spamming special attacks.   Overall: I love this game. New content gets in frequently and the developers listen to their community. If you wanna have a nice F2P MMORPG thats nots P2W, check it out! You have nothing to lose.",

There is always that one part of you inside that makes you want to get that higher mastery level. As a result, you decide to just spend a bit of time on it to farm for some flux for when you next come online. Next thing you know, it's 5am and you're still playing.  The fact that this game is free also makes things much better. Yes, recently the Devs decided to make some things only purchasable from real cash, but these people need at least someway of making money from this game!  The fact that the game is open to practically all ages really makes this more fun. Especially if it means playing with friends. This fantastic game is noticed by casual players who like building huge structures to show off their creativity, to more competitive players who like to complete quests, dungeons and fight in PVP mode.  Sure sure, the game is not perfect. But (very almost ;P) no game is either. Sometimes maintenance can last a while, but it's always worth the wait. I've been playing Trove for a while now, and it's amazing to see all the dedication that goes into this masterpiece with each and every update. I admit, I recently haven't been playing it as much as I used to, but I still love to play this game occasionally whenever I have free time on my hands. Besides, this game has enticed me for so long!  Hmmm, how should I say. Perhaps this game is a mix between Minecraft and an MMO? I'm not too sure to be honest, how ever what I am sure about is that once you click that 'Download' button, you're in for a heck of a treat.",

The dungeons are really creative, too, and they always match the biome they're in. It's not pay to win AT ALL. The building is pretty fun and great, and you can make some pretty cool things. The fighting system is really active, too. I played as a neon ninja, and honestly, its a fragile class that requires strategy. It's pretty hard to use(and I sucked at it).  Like all games, it has it's flaws. For example, it got pretty repetitive after like a month or so of playing it. It lacks PvP support, but that could be coming soon. There's very few biomes, so it lacks a bit of variety.  All in all, it's a really nice game to get into. You can venture around and explore, restocking at your portable home(called a cornerstone). Club worlds are private worlds that you can make for your group(you can make them public if you want) and allow you to unleash your creativity. There's a lot of neat stuff to do in the game, but the dungeoneering will get repetetive and will eventually feel like it lacks in variety. It's a nice game, but you will most likely end up uninstalling it after a while because it'll get a bit boring.  Tl;dr A pretty good game. I do recommend a download, but it will get repetitive after a while of playing.  EDIT: I came back to this game after a while, and it went from free to play into pay for things that used to be basic features. The challenge in this game was completely removed, too, since you can get your wings at mastery rank 5 or near there. You used to have to go until 30.",

I wouldn't be suprised if just playing the game itself costed about $4.99 an hour. The dev team just needs to not be super greedy. By the way, if you played this game last year, not everything was you have to pay for it. Also, classes used to be a free currecny, called Cubits, but now they're only CREDITS witch you need to buy with real cash. Also, Cubits are even HARDER to earn now that the star bar gives less.

I’m going to get the big thing I hated about Trove first, I think trove got boring because of something mostly all games have it’s the story of the game and how and what happened before time, but for me I was just put in there to start killing things (I was very confused when I started because there wasn’t a big tutorial) And to have a story in this game it would be A LOT cooler. Quests, A load of achievements, story’s or missions that just make you want to play the game and get you back into it. Another thing I HATED about Trove was the updates I felt every time I played Trove there was a hour update I had to go through. Which made this worse was I had to update it Through Steam AND through there launcher. I like Trove it has a great community and is a great game. There is just a lot of potential that I see in this game.  Thanks for Reading my Review I hope this helps! (Also sorry if there are any mistakes)",

I hhave hundreds more hours on the glyph luancher and have been playing trove for a while now. the devs definatly ♥♥♥♥ed the game up as of late and made it optimal for for rich/lucky players Playable for older players, and just down right garbage for newer players. hell you cant even get classes for free any more, making logging in everyday and getting cubits almost worthless, i have all the classes but still, new player will be dumb enough to open their wallets to the greedy devs we onced loved. Troves Mantle of Power update furthered this agony by implementing a new gem/dust feature, you can get gems and dust by bulk if your lucky enough, or just pay 30 bucks and be cruisin along. also with the leader board they reward P2P and P2W player even more.     i will always love and play trive but its goin down the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ &lt;3",

Many times have I found myself grinding dungeon after dungeon, biome after biome just grinding my way to the top, just to come across a new player who just opened his/her first box and got the rarest drop. Understanding the massive gap in this game's RNG system is quite lucrative... if you're in the end-game. This is because you need to stack massive amounts of caches in order to even have a chance at those 'rarer' drops. This can be good, since it means that you have to work for the gear, but it divides the players from those who can afford the time and effort, and those who only have 2-5 hours a day, not counting the individual player's efficiency(how good a player can do the work in the fastest way possible). In the end, the game has good class/skill synergy and enough material to keep a player busy for a substantial amount of time, with even more content being added continuously. In my personal opinion, this game has a bright future with much more room for improvement.",

            "review_text": "I'd like to update my review because of a important thing that happened to my husbands account...  Someone was able to imitate our IP address, hack into his account, and they destroyed all the items in our club world chests while he was sleeping. Since the GMs couldn't prove this happened, they couldn't restore the lost items. This has made both of us very upset, naturally, and it was the last straw for him. This stuff didn't happen until the PVP update happened months ago, and the people he kept beating were retaliating back at him.   So, we both uninstalled the game, and will not be playing it again.   _____________________________________________________  I've been playing since November of 2014, as soon as this game came out of closed beta. I really enjoy this game, aside from the hourly challenges. The hourly challenge is like a mad zerg rush to finish as many dungeons as you can in a 20 minute timespan, to fill your 'Challenge Bar'. Upon completion of each level of the bar, you get a 'Dragon Cache' that has (as of this moment) 4 different prizes: Eyeballs, Flux, Dragon Coins or Penta-Forged Souls. All of those items are used for upgrading your gear. You need lots and lots of Flux and Eyes. The classes are good, except the Boomeranger. His boomerang does not always work like it's supposed too. I'm pretty sure it's a glitch/bug that has not been fixed yet. The Shadow Hunter does not do too much damage either, and the Current new class, the Tomb Raiser, is a little OP in my opinion. If you have the Death Defying Vial potion, then you can tank like nobody's business.  Aside from those little issues, there is a building aspect to this game, kind of like minecraft. You get your own personal plot of land called a Cornerstone that you can build on. These plots of land look like a big black square with a little yellow sign on the edge of the square. No matter where you build your home, you can summon it at one of the black platforms, in any land you go to (aside from the club worlds). You can also make your own clubs, or join a club that someone else made. You can have up to 5 clubs in your roster, and you can be the leader of more than one club. I currently have 3 clubs that I own, I joined my Husband's club, and I am in a random club that a single person is in. There are a bunch of different blocks you can build with, and some organic blocks that can add liquids (water, lava, chocolate) to your home/club. There are also musical blocks to play with. I suggest you check out the Trovian Maestroes club, or Voxel Busters. They have some awesome songs setup there. There is gardening you can do. Some plants are decorative, others grow materials that you use for crafting.  With the Club worlds, you can expand beyond the initial land you have by crafting Terraformers. They are not cheap to make, but they do add extra biomes you can bulid on. I think the maximum number of members a club can have is 750? I'm pretty sure. There is no adventuring in the club worlds, sadly enough. Just open spaces to see people pixel-art.  So, do I recommend this game? Yes. You can send me a friend request too. I play almost every afternoon. I do not mind the grinding for items, but some people might. I'm looking forward to the new class coming out, the Lunar Lancer, since I tried it out on the Player Test Realm. I'm also looking forward to the new Shadow Tower update.",

(acutale i still play but for new players its not recomended)  PS: they are making every item untradable so you can beter play a non toxic 11 year old chat single player dungeon grind game.  new review: they made a game beter now in my opinion they made classes free again (you need to craft them ingame). this is a big deal because you can play more content but you also need it to get furter into the game. they are makeing the game less p2w in my opinion becaus some stuff that you can buy in the store you can't sell on the market anymore (you can still buy it for yourself witch is a bit p2w but its less). what they are doing wrong is makeing to mutch of the same content so there is no new content.  my opinion: play the game if you want to try it its free look for some OP friends to boost you a bit and it will be a lot of fun. its way more new player friendly because of the craftebel classes.  PS: you need to play a lot to get into the top so if you are a leaderboarder you will have to spend a lot of time.  sorry for bad english I have dyslexia.",

That was before gems were added to the game, and now that they are added, I feel like this game is more based off of RNG now. It can be hard to get gems that benefit your character, if you happen to be a class that deals physical damage, you'll probably get a million magic damage gems. Not only that, but you can't even buy other classes with the normal ingame currency anymore, instead you have to now use the premium currency. I'm not saying that players interested in this game shouldn't try it out, or saying that they should. If you want to play Trove, go for it! I still have fun with it, and I'm sure many others do aswell, it would just be nice if the devs made it so that there isn't as much pack and deal buying. Also fixing the PvP system would be nice.",

Im not saying that it is a bad game, its the opposite of that. Its just that when you get invested they make you pay, but in the beginning it is a great game that i have very fond memorys of. I have to give this game a good rating because of the memorys i have had with it, but be warned, if you get invested get ready to open up yuor wallet.",

It would take hours of farming dungeons.  Like a said if you just want to download it and play it for fun then you can but if you came here to become good, don't even think about it. drops have also lowered and now the game is slowly changing into a paid game not a free to play..",

The game also doesn't have the best servers at the moment which can lead to laggy unpleasant experiences. So, if you have bad patients, go ahead and hold off on playing this game until they upgrade the servers. Overall, 6/10- It's worth a try.",

            "review_text": "'TLDR: A true Free-to-Play game...' Ooooh... this review pains me to look at now. if you want to hear why this game is bad nowdays, you can look at many others. I'm just going to stress that this is a prime example of why premium content exists.  Are the devs being asses? I dunno, but I do have a big suspision that they are lieing to us. With the sudden relese on other platforms and more and more 'pay for/to get/to unlock/to progress...' is being shoved in are faces is because  I believe Trion feels that Trove, for it's huge playerbase back in the before times, was not pulling in nearly enough profit to warent it existing. Now lower your pitchforks, I know nobody likes the P word when it comes to 'free2play'. Give me a chance to explain, if you would be so kind.  Lets talk about the afore mentioned before times. I, and I'm sure many other players, loved all the free stuff they got. Free dragon coins, free classes, free this, free that, work a little bit for this and that... So on, so forth. I, for one, never felt the need to buy things because they always seemed to be handed to me. Due to that, one the off chance I had money to spare while I'm slowly building up my life being freshly on my own, I never really considered Trove as the spot to spend what little spare change I had. Does this sound familier to any of you? Not even in a 'money's so tight' situation like mine. 'But I'm not like that!' Sure. I'm sure you and many others weren't. I'm sure at least five times as many were though. We like our dollars a lot.  Now of course I'm not talking about everyone, nor are the devs entierly blameless, but I do feel like, when my fellow vets look at how much of the cash shop content was also throwm right into their hands as an appology for an update, or an event, or as a log-in reward, or for so many other reasons, what would compel you to spend? I'm just your average gamer. I'm not hardcore, I'm not particularluy serious, and trove, while an amazing game, was behind a lot of other games I enjoy in my list of priorities. Now if I was, I could have been like my friend, who saved up 200 dragon coins over the course of a month long event without paying a cent by buying from others as well, who also got them for free from the same event, and got every new dragon to come out for a long frikken time.  Now again, the Devs deserve some blame. They could of handled this is so many other ways. They could of been less open-handed, they could of looked at warframe and took some tips from them and balanced fairness and convinence (and if retail and the music industry has taught me anything, people will pay out they ♥♥♥ for convinence) rather then having the free players throw their lives away to have a quarter of the fun, They could of had some advertisments or hosted some companys or bands for a month or two (big money, that), and I've seen stuff like that done in amazing ways. and guess what. I pulled all those answeres from off the top of my head.   I miss this game, I really do, and if this all works out in the end, I would love to come backm esspecially now that I'm more well off, but even then, I only offer my money to games I respect, and Trove? Even with all the wonderful memories, has lost mine.  I hope it makes a rebound before it gets a stigma as a bad game.",
