            "review_text": "Regrettably, I have to NOT recommend this game with one exception - those who have laptops with a touchscreen or a Microsoft Surface will likely have a significantly more enjoyable time with this Fruit Ninja clone than those who have to use a mouse.  Being a Fruit Ninja variant, quick, precise swipes are necessary to maximize your score. As a result, in the more difficult levels a mouse simply will not do. This leads to very frustrating misses and lower-than-expected scores. I can play this to a much better degree on my laptop's touchscreen, but touchscreen laptops are relatively new and not many people have them yet. I've given up playing this on my main PC and will only play it on my touchscreen laptop due to the significant frustration level when (trying to) play this with a mouse.  The game itself is very cute with a cutout-style art design and some of the levels are very challenging even with a touchscreen. The game really is a lot of fun. I don't care if this is an iOS/Android port, and I really wish that people would stop complaining about that like it's a bad thing. (The game as I write this is only $5, for crying out loud!) But unfortunately this is one game where it is better experienced on a touchscreen device.",

Despite not there being much to root for, I will leaf a score of tree out of five (3/5).  Birch please!  Acorny time.  RelAXE, everything will be just pine.  I planted this review just for you.

It actually takes quite a while to complete the game and I got it for very cheap. It will test your reflexes and the story is quite fun.  The CONS: Sometimes the hitbox of logs might get you a failed cut when you actually did it right and 2 stages in particular are way too hard to get ''Perfect'' in the hardest difficulty compared to the rest of the game.  You might want to get this if it goes on sale!",

The gameplay is fast-paced but gives you breathing room and can be as forgiving or unforgiving as you make it due to the item system. New elements are introduced at just the right pace to keep things from getting stale without overwhelming the player. The game doesn't overstay it's welcome so it doesn't feel drawn out. It won't let you complete it just for 'finishing' levels either, so it's not painfully easy, though never too difficult either. I was legitimately surprised at how much I enjoyed this game. I wouldn't say it's worth its full retail price but if you can catch it on sale or in a bundle, I say go for it.",

He then gets revenge by cutting all of the trees in the world down.   So at the start of each level, Jack grabs his ax and sends an electric shock through the forest. Sending every tree up into the air. As they fall down, you have to draw a line through the logs to slice them in half. It starts off with normal logs, but then L, U, and T shaped logs come into play as well as logs that need to be cut 2 or 3 times.   At the end of each level, an animal appears inthe middle of a formation of logs. If you slice the animal, you fail, but if you dont, after each level, all of the animals you collect appear in your cabin. You can click them and they will bounce around. When my 8 year old sister watches me play this game, watching the animals jump around is her favorite part.   Depending on how well you do, you get a one, teo, or three star rating,which is represented by a gold, silver, or bronze sash on the critter at the end of each level. Later in the game, you unlock different zones by having certain amounts of stars. This reminds me of Angry Birds or something.  I got this game in one of the Humble Bundles. I like it, but I wouldn't pay the full steam price for it.  ",

There are a few glitches here and there, including unending rounds when a critical error in logic happens. Had to F4 out.  Its got enough subtle humor to keep it going. Enough interesting logs to deal with to add just enough puzzle content.  Overall I recommend this game to casual gamers.",

Once you've play the first level you have pretty much played the entire game.",

I wouldn't really buy it, but it's worth playing if you get it in a bundle. You'll build really good hand-eye coordination, I'll tell you that much, because it really was designed for touchscreen devices. Kind of like Fruit Ninja.",
