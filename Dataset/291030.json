            "review_text": " Footfalls echo in the memory Down the passage which we did not take Towards the door we never opened ~T.S. Eliot   This is the first visual novel that I've played from Winter Wolves, and I must say that I'm not impressed.  Always Remember Me  is an otome game with a somewhat ordinary concept, annoyingly stereotypical characters, suicidally repetitive choice actions and a scarcity of events about the main story to keep you interested. At this point, I must confess that I've completed my first playthrough quite easily and gave in a reaction of 'seriously?' at the first ending that I've discovered. During my second playthrough... I got bored and wandered off to do something else, forgetting the game running. When I remembered that I was playing the game, I came back and gave in 2 more hours of the gameplay to collect the missing achievements - a.k.a. fast-forwarded through some repetitive actions and only read event dialogues. Thus, my gaming time.  Let me introduce you to Amarantha - called as Amy by friends - literature student, part time worker in an ice-cream parlor and a boringly plain young woman that you could define in 3 adjectives completely: fickle, stereotypical and automated. At the start of our gameplay, Amy has a motorcycle accident alongside her boyfriend Aaron - which fills in the young, rich and handsome stereotype. Amy survives with some moderate wounds but alongside a slight concussion, Aaron now has amnesia. He doesn't remember a thing about Amy. At this point, it is up to us to either patiently wait by our amnesiac boyfriend to help him regain his memories or run after a limited selection of other handsome young man who might become equally interested with us - namely Lawrence, Eddie and Hugh; appropriately filling in the shy cutie, the workaholic overachiever and the charming artist stereotypes in that order.  So... As you may observe, our heroine hypothetically overcomes the trauma of losing 'the love of her life' quite easily. She - and any other cute boy that she may end up with - are written really badly. They all consist of stereotypes with shallow reactions, superficial dialogue options and boringly unimaginative personalities. One could claim that I shouldn't expect much literary narrative or originality from an otome game to begin with, but without the visual novel quality of an interesting story or interesting enough characters - or at least decent narrative - I most certainly see no reason to spare my time specifically to experience a couple cute pictures of pretty anime characters kissing and some really lame dialogue note at the side. Sorry, but this is what the game eventually ends up being so.  For the gameplay: you have 4 romance options, 4 stats that you can raise through completing more or less the same actions for a period of 3 months. Each stat concerns one of the romance option as a target. You wake up, work in the parlor, visit the romance option, raise stats with a limited selection of actions, sleep and repeat. Oh, and once in a while you stumble upon an event where you'll get a relationship raise if you are to choose the right one in the dialogue options. Eventually, you hit an ending for the boy that you picked, witness a cheesy 'happily ever after' scene and carry on. Nothing else. No surprise factor, no real challenge, no in-depth story. Nothing. You repeat the same action for the millionth time while getting harassed by the endless repetition of the same 8 note soundtrack to be rewarded by a cute picture and 3-4 sentences telling how happy you ended up. Brilliant.  Many would blame me to already know what I would get myself involved with when I picked an otome game to play, but with games from Cheritz or Hanako Games of the same genre in the market, you really should skip this if you are not getting it in a bundle, like super cheap. Else, consistently avoid this one to enjoy another VN or otome with more imaginative gameplay or at least better character concepts and/or story.

He has no memory of you. So far it sounds okay.  But the problem with the game is, it quickly turns into endless stat grinding. You have to do the same things and visit the same places trying to increase your stats and relationship points.  Pros: + Nice artstyle + Nothing else I can think of :D  Cons: + It lacks decent storyline and conversations. + Game is mostly about grinding stats and it becomes boring real fast.",

            "review_text": "Okay, lets get this straight. For £12-£14, this game is seriously not worth it.  All you do all game is grind. You grind to get money for your laptop, dress, plushie and books. You grind to increase your relatonships points by 1 each time. You get no story apart from the intro.  I did this game first in easy mode to get a feel, I need 100 points to get an ending. Any ending at all. With any of the love interests. It's so rediculously hard to get that high.  Because you're supposed to be living this girl's life. She has a job, she has interests. You're not supposed to be turning her into a psycho stalker that spends every.waking.moment talking to this guy (whoever you chose) Cause what about the Morale and energy you have to keep tabs on? If you don't, money dwindles.   I love visual novels. Any one I see, I try to get. Despite not having much money most of the time.  Don't waste your time or money on this one. The developer should be ashamed.  I agree with steam greenlight and everything since it gives smaller developers a chance to make it. But when you get pathetic pieces like this turn up and try to take your money. It turns the whole concept into a joke.",

            "review_text": "There would not be a chance in hell that I would recommend this to anyone - trying to sit though this thing and record a let's play for YouTube is just sucking me dry because of how uninteresting the whole thing is. It doesn't help that the main character failed to engage me at all so I find it impossible to actually care weather she gets back into a relationship or not. The other characters are pretty paper thin too and only have a few quirks about them, so ultimately they're pretty dull too.  The sim elements that are in the game that can be trained are really uninspired and they're really just another relationship meter for specific love interests (For example: Aaron relates to the 'Romance' stat and Lawrence relates to the 'Culture' stat). There is really no need for them and it just seems to me that the developers just included them to give you the illusion of progression, when actually you're not and if you're not maxing a specific stat like Romance for Aaron you're wasting your ♥♥♥♥ing time.   There are arguments about 'are video games art', or somthing along those lines. I got a better one for you - 'Is Always Remember Me a game?' Even if you're a big fan of VNs, this would not interest you. There are far better ways to waste £14 than actually playing this crap. With that much money I could either go to the local video game store and buy some real games, or maybe buy a extra large pizza with everything on top of it and share it with my pals, or maybe I might just buy a not very well writen, not at all engaging pile of nothing where the protaginist is just some boring girl trying to get her boring boyfriend to love her again and going through her boring daily routine every boring turn of her ultimately boring life.  TL;DR - It's pointless, stupid and a woeful waste of good cash. Thank God that someone else bought it for me, so I can call him a dumbass for actually buying it.",

Overall, though, it is a very enjoyable story and I felt like the characters were well thought out and given proper personalities.   9/10, would get amnesia and play again.",

All the guys in this game are either hard to pursue or jerks. This seems to be more of a life management game than a dating simulator. The best part of this game is that you can go to the library to read books and post on your blog about the books you read.",

Each has their own personality and quirks, aswell as enjoying (or not!) different things, and each ending is amazing in its own way. Personally, for me, Hugh's ending(s) are the easiest to achieve, with Aaron's being the hardest, and Lawrence ended up being my favourite character! I love different aspects of each character and their respective ending. I guess games like this are 'each to their own', but I'd definitely recommend it, just don't be foolish and under the influence that this is a 'dating sim', as in, a dating sim where it results in sex scenes with the love interests, because it has absolutely no sex or erotica in it at all. Despite that, it's a fun game to play, light-hearted (for the most part) and it's worth getting! (Er, being brutally honest, not at full price. I got it for £6.99 during the Summer sale and I think that's about the most I'd pay for it anyway! So wait until it's on sale and grab it then!)",

It may just be me but dispite all the little things not done well, I do like the fact that this is one of the first dating sims to be brought to steam and I would like to see more from the makers who do have similar games on their website.  The character art is nice, the background's look great and the music was okay (I muted it because I do that with these sort of games).  All in all, 'Always Remember Me' isn't the greatest dating sim but it most certainly is NOT the worst I've played.  For those who bothered to look at this and have yet to purchase 'Always Remember Me', I say get this game when it goes on sale. Just a recommendation.  Thank you and goodnight.",

I didn't even like Aaron, in fact, only at the end does he stop being a jerk to you and getting back with his old girlfriend. Lawrence is probably the nicest guy so I went back through the game and tried the Lawrence route. I ended up wanting to skip pretty much everything I had seen previously as this game has little to no replayability.  Overall, the writing was mediocre, the music wasn't very good, the skill building didn't seem to achieve anything at all, there is minimal story and lots of grinding doing the cafe, sleeping, going to the park etc. It would have been MUCH better if they focused less on making it like a game with a skill tree and such, and just focused on writing a good story. People play visual novels for the story and this really felt flat and boring.  On a positive note, the art was quite lovely.  3/10",

There's too much focus on stat building and you have to use a walkthrough next to the game if you even want to get somewhere route wise which completely takes away from the immersion and makes it more of a chore. The game wasn't completely terrible, I still managed to unlock some endings after all, but I can't recommend it, at least not at the full price, it's way too expensive.
