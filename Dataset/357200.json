            "review_text": "Felt like 500 years though it only took 3 hours.  The graphics are bad. The BGM would have driven me over the edge if the game had been any longer. The sound effects are bad. The story is bad, and old, and so is the game concept, which looks inspired by  EGA Trek  [archive.org] , which, all things considered, is still the better game. The controls are extra bad: you need to move and rotate, and you do that with either mouse button, which makes good kiting all but impossible; and it only looks right when the ship is center screen, which it often isn't, but the game will still act as if it were. I also tried Xbox controller twin stick controls, couldn't get the hang of them: the ship still seemed to behave erratically. (I wonder what the mobile version controls are: tilt and point?) On every space journey there's what seems a 90% chance of having exactly *one* random encounter, except these get old fast, and you don't profit in any way from the fights: no loot, no XP in any of the game.  The best part is that there's a load-out phase where you can change your ship configuration and trade points for speed, handling, shields, and weapon damage and range, so that when you misjudge, you can try another load-out which may work better on the present enemy encounter - except that from mid-game on, fast engines and long-range missiles pretty much dominate anything again and again and again and again and again, because it's the same few fights over and over, mostly. Mysteriously, the HUD lacks range indicators and cool-down indicators, and you can only fire on the one selected target and only when it is within your firing arc, even when you're using homing missiles -- on the long-range missiles and medium-range beams, this means weaving from side to side, wondering if you missed the heading or if the weapon hasn't cooled down yet. On top of that, damage is random, i.e. a big proportion of hits don't actually do any damage. Miss a missile hit two or three times in a row, and their shield is back up. Oh, and if you're unlucky, your ship spawns outside the screen, and if you're very unlucky you can't fly it back in and have to close the game externally because you can't leave fights.  I've played free flash games that did this better. This game is a slog, not fun.",

            "review_text": "Horrible, Horrible game. I developed better games as part of university projects. Seriously. What made them put this game up for sale? Got it on a super sale with a badge crafting coupon at 90% a lot of time ago. Was not really worth it. Farmed the trading cards and deleted. I tend buy more indie games than AAA games on steam because as an aspiring game developer my self I want to support indie devs. But only support them when they actually make something worthwhile. With this game it is not the case. Not worth it 90% discount, and definately not worth it at full price.",

            "review_text": "Wow. Just Wow. I really dont know what else to say. I completely understand that this is an independent game and a low budget title. I can certainly forgive the poor graphics. However, the writing is absolutely horrendous and the gameplay is ... well absolutely horrendous. The controls make no sense and are extremely awkward. Getting your ship to face the direction you want is nearly impossible. There is no depth to the combat, which is merely an exercise in trying to keep your ship pointed at the bad guys (which is more difficult than you would think).  Interesting concept but very poorly executed.",
