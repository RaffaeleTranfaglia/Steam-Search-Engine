            "review_text": "I've loved played the previous two Frederic Games so I thought why not, let's get the third one to support the developers. Now I'm a little bit iffy on this recommendation.  To start off, this Directors Cut didn't really add anything much from the previous game except for two additional levels that were squeezed before the boss. These levels weren't as great as the other levels (you could tell from the animation quality) I know Director's cut doesn't really mean a whole new game, it should be the original with some things, but I was expecting them to fix some of the issues from the previous games.  Now There are more problems. Touchscreen doesn't work after the first song. Some cutscenes are extremely laggy compared to others. The rest of the game is fine, but the touchscreen part really let me down. Also the mouse stops working after the first level, which are  major issues considering the game depends on either keypad, mouse, or touchscreen input.    I didn't mind playing the entire game again, but I felt like this Directors Cut did't add as much as I expected it too. The multipler part is cool, but I think this Directors Cut needed to be polished more, like fixing the important interface issues (major con)",

            "review_text": "I've already written a positive  review  for the game, and everything that I had to say about the Frederic:RoM remains true for the Director's Cut.  Technically it's the original game + a DLC. The 'owners' -90% disconut was a fair price for an 'upgrade'. The thing is - it was a temporary discount, and now all players, both new and old, are expected to pay the full price for two extra songs and the MP.   While the multiplayer idea may sound good, it does not really work well. It used to be completely and entirely broken at first, but even now, with all its fixes it's barely playable. Even if they eliminate all the bugs, the gameplay had never been designed with a MP in mind, and 'random lobby' waiting time is only going to increase.  The new songs do not add much to the overall game quality. They are actually weaker compared to the original tracks (with music&amp;sotry&amp;visuals).   TLDR - If you already own the old game and got the -90% upgrade - you're fine.  - If you already own the old game, but had missed the discount - keep it this way and\\or wait for another -90% - If you had not played the original game you may go for this one, but have in mind that the old F:RoM is cheaper, and you won't lose much after all.",

Still nice game and thats it. I'd recommend it for people that have fast reaction speed and to the people wanting to play the game , I say good luck.",
