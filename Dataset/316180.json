            "review_text": "One of the my favorite things about Harmonix as a studio is how they’ve managed to hang on to their soul and passion for game development even after creating two of the most successful franchises in video game history (and subsequently, the many, many sequels which followed). Guitar Hero and Rock Band were a legitimate phenomenon, so much so that their popularity eventually became their downfall (taking music games as a collective whole with them). Harmonix themselves have yet to close up shop though, and in the post-music game crash they’ve started to experiment and begin to redefine themselves as a studio capable of more than popularizing plastic instruments.  A City Sleeps is the result of their recent efforts, an energetic bullet hell shooter fueled by thumping EDM and blazing neon lights. Entering the dreams of a troubled cyberpunk city, the nightmares of its inhabitants become personified as alien specters, tormenting their hosts and waging a war on anyone who should try to exorcise them.  However intriguing a setup, it was almost immediately forgotten once I actually entered a dream and became entranced by the sensory explosion I was somehow enacting. While it occupies space in the realms of both rhythm games and bullet-hell shooters, A City Sleeps’ biggest strength is as an active visualizer which requires your complete attention if you hope to see it through to the end.  Each shot fired provides a beat, a synth, a note in a constantly remixing track which ebbs and flows as you fight off enemies, each of which in turn provides their own melody. The compositions which emerge from these systems are at once beautifully uniform and unstable; digital consistency grinding against human unpredictability and imperfection to mold a track that is immediately familiar yet never quite identical.  The act of remixing these tracks alone isn’t what captives me though. It’s in the combination of intense arcade shooting, total absorption in the gorgeous and overwhelming visuals, and the constant harmony of so many sounds coming together that something incredible is born. A City Sleeps isn’t a game which compels me to explore it fully, not due to a lack of curiosity at what might be hidden at the end of its most challenging stages, but because I find a comfort and excitement in its most basic missions. The earliest levels showcase A City Sleeps at its most dynamic and controllable, allowing the player to appreciate the genius of the various instruments working to allow such a game to function, without the all-encompassing stress and overstimulation present when the difficulty is raised.  It’s a slight disappointment then that these moments are almost immediately replaced with missions that lean heavily toward static memorization and mechanical competency. I was enthralled by my first trilogy of dreams, but found myself losing patience and interest when the difficulty rose and I needed to utilize a more utilitarian approach to combat. A City Sleep is at its best when it allows the player enough freedom to experiment without given so much as let their attention wander, something sadly only understood in the earliest moments of the game.  A City Sleeps may tend to favor its least interesting and impressive elements, but while it runs short, in its most accessible state it is also its most ingenious. This is not the game I would have expected to see from Harmonix, and their inexperience definitely shows in attempting to repurpose the same progression system that worked so much better in their previous games, but for how limited its scope may be I find myself continually fascinated by what A City Sleep has attempted, and in its finest moments succeeds with beyond question.

            "review_text": "This is a hard choice to make. On one hand the game is interesting, but on the other it left me very frustrated and disappointed.  Starting with the good:   The soundtrack. It's fantastic   The art. It looks nice (in still frames)   The small story paragraphs you get between levels and difficulties are nice   The ghost mechanic, you can bring 3 assist characters to a stage with you, is kind of cool.   Now for the bad:   The art. Everything becomes a messy unfocused blob on the harder stages. Very difficult to even tell what you're doing. Along with that a lot of the enemies (and the main character) have very little actual animation. Her sword doesn't even go a full 360 degrees around her which could make for some confusing visual feedback when you're shooting above you.   The soundtrack tied to the music. In theory it could work well, see Beathazard, but here the soundtrack is all multilayered Synthey-Acid/Trance/Trap music and incredibly hard to predict. What it really feels like is you and the enemies are just adding random beats to the main music causing nothing to be easy to predict.   The character's movement. She's slow. Her dash is too far. You will get hit. A lot.   Now, if you really enjoy bullethells and the whole 'music and gameplay affecting each other' thing appeals to you maybe you can look past these shortcomings, but for me I couldn't and I can't recommend this game.",

            "review_text": "As much as I like bullet hells, this one kinda falls flat. The high-contrast art style actually makes it substantially harder to differentiate anything at a glance, requiring you to look more closely at any given part of the screen to tell what's going on. Obviously, in a game where you have to at least roughly know where all the bullets and enemies are to make any informed decision about where to dodge, this is kind of hindrance. Plus, while the player character's hit box is fortunately visible, her large sprite makes it unintuitive and the health/energy UI sitting right underneath make it hard to tell at a glance where her hit box is, making dodging even more of a hassle than it needs to be.  I also don't honestly think the rhythm mechanics work very well. The fact that your basic shots fire in time with the music seems like it ought to be cool, but it ends up making your primary weapon hugely unreliable. There are times where your damage output can drop significantly within the course of a second, or suddenly change from a straight shot to a spread, and there's not a whole lot you can do about it.  Also the ghosts are kind of a joke. I didn't get far enough to get more than one extra ghost and relic each, but unless the first two offense-oriented ghosts are just incredibly underpowered, the healing ghost is by far the best. Its only real downside is penalizing your score a bit, which doesn't affect progression at all. If you're just trying to win, healing is always the best choice, so why even have the other ghosts?",

            "review_text": "If you're a fan of bullet hell shoot'em ups then A City Sleeps will satisfy that craving for several hours. In total it took me about 7 hours to finish the game, which wasn't difficult but takes some getting used to. I would recommend playing on a controller it may end up being easier to control, I played through the game using only keyboard and it didn't feel terrible but for anyone not used to playing a SHMUP using a keyboard, they should get a controller.  The only drawback to the game is there are only 3 stages, each one will unlock an increased difficulty once the stage is beaten. Due to this it does feel a bit repetitive. The thing that changes this up is that the ghosts (powerups) that unlock after beating certain stages does change the way you would play a level and that keeps things fresh for a little while.  This is made by Harmonix so the soundtrack is very good and since the music flows with the bullets and powerups when everything works it really feels like you can predict where you should be to avoid bullets. For anyone that really enjoys the SHMUPS from Treasure or Ikaruga, this may be too easy of a game but is still worth a playthrough.",

The game also has one of the best soundtracks I've heard in a while and the art is fantastic; I love Matt Perlot's art, it's just great. The game might feel short to some people because it only has 15 levels but each level increases with difficulty the further you progress which adds more challenge to this game because, duh, it's a Bullet Hell shooter game, that's the whole point.  In short, I would give this game an 8.5/10. It's a great Bullet Hell shooter with fantastic art, music and gameplay.",
