            "review_text": "The initial concept of CAPSULE is very simple but the execution is where it shines.  The game does an excellent job with the atmosphere and immersion. They aren't joking when they say that if you have anxiety trigggers then this game might not be for you. What should be a simple matter of managing your resources has some very surprising refinements and is complicated by the way the world reacts to you, the subtle signs, sounds and behaviours. There is that very strong tension that comes from the warning that your fuel is low, or the gasping breaths as your oxygen supply runs out.  That said, there are some frustating points. The world is randomly generated every time you leave a docking station along with a sensor ping. This can lead to some cheap shots that cost you your resources. Sometimes it feels like the difficulty randomly spikes because of the generation and the immersion is lost as you just accept your death to restart and try again, this can make the death sequence annoying after the first few times.  Still, I enjoyed it and even after being able to manage my resources to maximum efficiently and accurately guess what things were based by their natural behavours and sound alone there were some heart pounding moments of near panic.  The game does very little to explain itself and instead leaves you, the player, to figure things out for yourself. You only get the basic controls once at the start of the game.  In technical terms, the game is set to fixed video options. It locks the aspect ratio of the game and gives you either Stretched Fullscreen (with blackness in the wasted space at the sides), Fullscreen (with blacknes around the game area) and Windowed mode. It can be forgiven as it is a point behind the immersion. You also cannot rebind controls.  If you enjoy games centered on immersion and place that above mechanics then I cannot reccomend CAPSULE any harder than I already am. If you enjoy exploration and figuring things out for yourself then CAPSULE is a fun little title. For mechanically focused players like myself, there are surprising refinements to be found and enjoyed. If any of those sound don't sound appealing to you then CAPSULE may be more frustration than anything else.",

            "review_text": "Trapped in a pod which is running out of air and fuel, racing to your next checkpoint, with only a sonar ping to see whats around you in order to avoid the many dangers outside the pod.  This is a very fun and addictive game, if not a little frustrating at times. Game provides a great atmosphere both in visual style and sound, and had me on the edge of my seat many a time.  I really had a great experience during my first play, and look forward to additional time with this game.",

            "review_text": "Immersive short game in which you pilot a capsule with only the radar screen acting as the interface. The sound effects (e.g. coughing, gasping for air right before you suffocate) add to the claustrophobic feeling of being inside a small vessel.  The goal for each level is to reach the next outpost before you run out of oxygen and fuel.  Managing your oxygen and fuel resources while attempting to dodge enemies and hazards make for some tense and exciting gameplay.  Story is told through communication logs between each level and is quite minimalistic and cryptic towards the end.  Game length is short (~2 hrs to complete on first run) and there is no incentive to replay the game after it's finished. The game is initially difficult, but gets easier once you understand the enemy patterns. The key to this game is to move consistently and methodically and never rush through the levels.  Overall, if you enjoy games with an immersive atomsphere, and don't mind its short length, this title is worth a try.",
