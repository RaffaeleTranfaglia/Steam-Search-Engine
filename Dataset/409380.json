            "review_text": "Join Cid and Markus as they're opening taverns in an fantasy world!  If you're familiar with Diner Dash, this game will be easy to understand. Your goal is to seat customers, satisfy them by taking their commands, bringing them and take their money. But it will be not easy as customers are differents. Parachutists for example don't have patience when pilots are a command twice. Also, like in Diner Dash, the colors of their clothes are important: seat them in a seat with the same color and you'll raise the points. And you can also improve your skills by making Cid faster for example.  And you're not alone: you will find some help from your friends, even if some can throw a fit: they're calming the customers for example, if you take your childhood friend. Or they can raise the multiplier for your score, like the Old Jefferson.  What's different from Diner Dash? Well for your tip, for example, you need to click on the table when the arrow is in the green section. You have also VIP tables (though they're the counterpart of the booked table) where you sit only people with a red scarf. Also, if you want to win potions that will make you go faster for a moment or stop the time, you have bonus levels in the form of a match-3 minigames. Take-away orders are also making it differ from Diner Dash.  However, I've a little problem with Among the Heavens. Clicking isn't always easy, mainly with Jefferson. I click on his table but it's not enough. I have to click on him. Also, you can't choose a seat for your friends, you'll end up destroying the bonus of the colored seat for example.  The soundtrack is good and the graphics are in a sort of 3D. They're correct for a game for 3 bucks.  In other words, Among the Heavens is a nice Diner Dash-like game, with interesting mechanics. For the price, well, it's delivering a good content and fun. You can go ahead.",

            "review_text": "This game is Diner Dash with a bunch of stuff thrown on top of it with little thought. If you've never played Diner Dash, it's a bad waitress simulation game where the optimal way to play is actually to make customers wait as long as possible so you can rack up the longest chains you can. You can only chain the same move, so you must wait for all customers to finish picking their items on the menu and risk making some of them angry in order to pull a full menu combo, which you then link into a food delivery combo and then a check collecting combo. It makes it kind of a dumb waitress game, since again, this means that you're a terrible waitress, but it works as a videogame and is pretty fun.  Among the Heavens is a pretty much exact Diner Dash clone. It plays exactly the same with you clicking on pieces in a diner (in this case a potion shop in a fantasy setting), and queueing up actions for your waiter to perform as you keep track of the guests and their desires. The problem here, like I said in the beginning, is that they've thrown a bunch of stuff on the Diner Dash formula without really considering what that does to the gameplay. First off, why would I want to play a very uninspired and barebones version of Bejeweled between levels? Doing so unlocks a speed boost potion... Why? Is the game not balanced for people who cannot be bothered to play Bejeweled in their waiter game? If it is, why do the potions even exist? This is supposed to be 'bonus content', but is just a pointless chore.  The worst offense, though, is that the game throws in stuff that throws your combos off for no good reason. There are customers that will order twice, ruining your chain. Customers can drop their drinks, which for some reason means you're obligated to serve them a new one instead of charging them for the busted potion bottle, and again screws up your combo. There are earthquakes that makes a random number of customers drop their drinks. There's some old man sitting in a corner who the game doesn't even explain, why he's there or what he does, he just has an impatience timer and you have to click on him and, again, ruin your combo for no reason. Maybe that guy is explained later, but in the area he shows up in, the game just tells you 'yeah just click this guy to ruin the combo for no reason, shut up about it' and you're left wondering what the devs are thinking. Yet another thing that complicates combos is the introduction of 'VIP' customers as well as parties larger than your seating arrangement, which makes the game move tables around to accomodate them, which in effect makes it impossible to properly plan your seating. You simply can't know in advance if a party of six is coming and if you can use the tables for four for the party of four or if you have to make them wait since they're more patient than the upcoming party of six is. That got complicated but if you've played Diner Dash, you know what I mean. The VIPs can be worked around by trying to keep the VIP tables empty, but the large parties really mess you up and make it nearly impossible to predict the perfect seating and almost requires trial and error for high scores. On top of that, the visual identifier for VIP customers is a red scarf. There are red and blue customers. You guessed it, the red scarf they're wearing is the exact same shade of red as the rest of their outfit. It's pretty bad.  It's not a bad Diner Dash clone, it works and you can click on things and serve customers and pretty easily beat the 3-star requirement for each level. It has a cute little fantasy aesthetic where you serve magical potions to people living in some kind of sky city instead of serving food to people in a diner. I did two 'diners' (out of six) in the 0.6 hours I played, so it does seem on the short and easy side and the game runs in 4:3 with no option to change it, so those are two pretty big negatives. The big complaint, of course, is the broken chaining and how dull that can make the game and, ultimately, this game is a thumbs down. Play Diner Dash instead.",

            "review_text": "When the kid said 'the old man might make us a visit' after Markus said that the 'tavern' was in honor of the 'old man', I realized what truly is happening here. The poor kid, going by the name of Cid was constantly abused by his parents at the age of 6 in ways unimaginable. Whenever his parents weren't looking, he would run off to visit his grandfather, the 'old man'. He found safety in his warm embrace, and for 2 years he would visit him almost every day, even though he had to run half a mile to reach his house. But then, when he reached the age of 8, his grandfather fell prey to prostate cancer. He never got news of this. When he ran off to see his grandfather but couldn't find him, his parents found out and drove him into the city, next to a dump, to live his sad life there until he met his demise. He was soon found by Markus, the leader of a hardcore drug ring, who offered to take him into his care and teach him the ways of the world. Markus was a co-worker of Cid's mom before he got fired for doing drugs during his night shift. He heard about the kid's grandfather from her, and Markus felt touched by her story, even though the heartless monster of a mother did not care one bit. Markus decided to not tell Cid about such events until he reaches the age of 18, him being 13 now.  10/10 story mediocre graphics",

However I couldn't play it on my 64-bit Windows 7 PC. Luckily I have a laptop which has 32-bit Windows 7 so I managed to run the game on it. What a relief. Otherwise I was going to request for a refund and was going to give 'Among the Heavens' a negative review. There is a way to run it on 64-bit Windows 7 but I couldn't. Keep that in mind before buying the game. Otherwise I am really glad I bought it. Managed to get all the achievements in about 5 hours. Not bad. The gameplay is good, the music isn't bad too. Worth the 50 cents.",
