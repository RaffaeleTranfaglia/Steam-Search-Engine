Actually have classes not just have every gun in the game xD  When some one kills you and get to see where they are put a red out line around them instead of the red arrow and show their health  debuff the sniper some how to op :P  And have like a trainning course to teach people how to play but you can still get the hang of it eaisley but if you guys add more stuff may want to show new people how to play  Dont let rocket launchers kill you through walls its just a lot of spawn killing  Just the knife in general does no damage any where else except the head and one hit kill have it do damage no matter where you hit the person and no one hit kill to the head  This isn't that big but the weapons look really weird likle the sniper or the rocket launcher the only normal ones are the knife and the pistol, if you have time please change how they look &lt;3  ",
