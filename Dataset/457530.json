Steam: $0.99  The art is very simplistic. But it has its own appeal and style. There are only a few different backgrounds. There is a small selection of CG’s as well.   The gameplay is very simple. Read and then make a choice. There are only a few choices in the entire game. But that’s mostly because the game is sooooo very short. I unlocked all the endings in under an hour.   But the question is: Was it worth it?  I liked it. I thought it was clever that a couple choices really could decide you fate. While it is very short it is also very cheap. The artwork was charming and the story got it’s point across quickly. If you are looking for something to kill an hour with this could fit the need.   Recommended.",

It's a nice enough story with good music and full voice acting. The art style is a little strange with the blacked-out features but I would much rather have no features than bad features so it didn't bother me.",
