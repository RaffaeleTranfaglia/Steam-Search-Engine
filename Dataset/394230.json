You have been warned  EDIT: Battleborn is also a ghost town -which could be another factor why we can barely get any active players in servers- due to it being overwhelmed by games like Overwatch. I've heard that there were Australian servers but when there are no active ones (with players in them) it routes you to servers in other regions, providing a bad internet connection. Australian servers were provided but its possible these were shut down due to the cost of running them (Thank you A Flying Lemur). Apart from this massive problem -which is why i'm not recommending it- Battleborn is a pretty damn good game.",

            "review_text": "Battleborn started as a fairly decent game that went downhill in it's months, with actual reasons behind it. I first played the open beta because it seemed cool, it was made by the same people who made Borderlands, so that got me hooked onto it. A lot of it's humor seems to be coming from Borderlands 2 other than the slightly worse Pre-Sequel, and much of the gameplay style seems fun and original, co-op slightly resembling Borderlands however, but all of Borderlands mechanics seemed to have been adapted and changed into Competitive Play.  Then Battleborn got ultimately thrashed by Overwatch, people made unecassary comparisons due to it's art style and class based mechanics. From playing both, they're both entirely different games, however, quality-wise, Overwatch seems to be a more well-developed 2016 game than Battleborn.  Competitive Play is a nightmare, with queues that take up half an hour, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ match-ups (Teamed with people who just started playing against people who know the game like theb ack of their hand), and the most common complaint, the player base that stooped beneath 1k, which i'll talk about later. There seems to be balance issues between characters as well.  Co-Op seems, sadly, the highlight of this game. Co-Op actually manages to be fun, but with a few game-breaking bugs in the way, more infamously, players and enemies getting stuck outside the map, and on another note, there are only a few co-op maps.  In it's recent months however, Gearbox seems to be doing such a ♥♥♥♥ job at promoting it and upkeeping it, the game fell apart. Gearbox is desperately trying to keep this game alive, despite it already being practically dead at below 1k people. A surprising two million people played the open beta, then bugs, microtransactions, and it's competitor, Overwatch killed it.   The game's dead and mangled guys, don't put $60 into this, or summer sale wise, $30.",

            "review_text": "Being that Battleborn has been created by the team behind Borderlands and has similar stylised visuals, the two were always going to be compared to each other. And right from the outset, it is plain to see that there is a heavy Borderlands influence in much of Battleborn. But they are indeed separate entities, with Battleborn taking a MOBA style approach with the multiplayer element of the game, and featuring new characters and a different setting. The premise behind Battleborn is that five races are vying to control the last star, but decide to put their disagreements aside to battle the evil Varelsi, who want nothing more than to destroy the star and plunge the galaxy into darkness.  The initial cutscene does a great job giving us this brief backstory. It also emphasises the fast paced nature of the game with some up-tempo tunes. Indeed, I played one early mission as the sniper character known as Marquis and took my time thoroughly scouring the locales for all the bonuses and credit shards. Apparently, there’s a time limit, and I used up the allotted time. OK, so I did spend a couple of minutes making myself a cup of coffee…but a time limit for the single player portion of the game? Really?  I didn't make that mistake again. Besides that gripe, the private singleplayer (with AI) or public co-op missions (with online compatriots) are rather enjoyable. The co-op allows five friends (or indeed strangers) to team up to play one of the eight story chapters that follow on from the tutorial style introduction. Although there are only eight chapters and there really isn’t that much of a story - apart from the battle for the last remaining star - the levels are well designed and journeying through them with a couple of mates is a heap of fun.  Apart from the playing co-op, there are currently three multiplayer modes, each with 3 maps. Capture mode is basically a Capture-the-Flag derivative where teams must capture and protect various points within the map. The other two modes are somewhat more original. The Meltdown mode has teams guiding groups of minions towards a minion grinder at the centre of the map, somewhat like a bunch of lemmings falling off a cliff to their deaths. The goal of your team is to get as many minions as possible to their destination whilst preventing the opponents from doing so. The Incursion mode has teams attempting to find and destroy two Sentry Bots, with the first team to destroy both declared the winners. All modes feel extremely well balanced, giving teams a chance to catch up if they fall behind at the start.   The variation comes in the form of the character roster, or as they are known, the Battleborn. With 26 characters to choose from, you would think that some of them would be largely familiar. But this isn’t the case. Although the characters would fit into stereotypical classes, their special abilities give them an individuality that sets them apart from another character of a similar class. As you would expect though, not all characters are available from the get-go and need to be unlocked by completing missions or accomplishing specific goals.  Combat feels somewhat more basic than in other shooters, primarily because most characters are limited to one weapon (with increasing capabilities) and their two (or three) special abilities. Unlike Borderlands, where new guns were as rare as grains of sand on a beach, in Battleborn, gamers are pretty much stuck with the same preset weapon throughout the entire mission. But they also have the use of the character's special abilities. These abilities have increased effectiveness as the missions progress through leveling up. And leveling up happens quite quickly throughout the course of a mission, and at each upgrade point, players get to select one of two upgrades to their abilities through the Helix system.   These special abilities can take a little bit to get used to and a strategy is often required for when best to use these powerful attacks. Boss Battles (which are presented in much the same way they are in Borderlands) are particularly important for ability use. These battles can often be drawn out and do provide a challenge in both single player and co-op. Along the way, players will be able to collect bonuses that give short term gains, such as increased speed or shorter cool-downs for abilities. Credit shards can also be collected. These shards are used as the in-game currency and allow gamers to purchase turrets, traps or drones that aid in destroying the enemy.  Like Borderlands, Battleborn is full of colour, and the stylish visuals are painted with the same brush. The cartoon style visuals, combined with the often humorous quips, add to the comic nature of the game, giving the impression that it doesn’t take itself all too seriously. It all feels like a classic Saturday morning cartoon. Indeed, the opening cinematic had me reminiscing about He-Man and Astro Boy. Despite many things happening on screen, the interface is simple and easy to decipher. Shield levels and health are clear, enabling gamers to take added cover if their shields are low. Voice acting too, is clear and understandable, with each of the characters being discernible from others.  Battleborn has clearly been influenced by Borderlands in a host of ways. The visuals, the humour and even many of the gameplay aspects such as the loot crates and shield regeneration, seem to come right from the Borderlands school of gaming design. If I was to sum up Battleborn, it would be Borderlands with new characters and a new setting and an added MOBA style multiplayer component. Of course, as a gamer who played countless hours roaming over Pandora and Elpis, there isn’t too much wrong with that, as all the Borderlands games have been enjoyable. Battleborn, despite the simplistic nature of the combat and time limit issues, is still a fun jaunt, and one that has a ton of replayability due to the characters alone.",

            "review_text": "EDIT: With the extremely low player base, the fact that updates are really only coming once a month on a game that still needs so much work, as well as the ludicrous new in game currency for a $60 dollar title... I can't really recommend it. I wish I could, I really do, but GBX/2K or whoever is to blame shot this game in the face, and it does not seem like they'll fix it ever.   The game REQUIRES about a 10 hour time investment until it 'clicks' and you start to see the bigger picture. It really is an extremely addicting game and a crazy amount of fun, and it's a shame that it is getting overlooked.   Yet, the game is far from perfect. Having some strange/bad design choices (mostly in terms of UI) and is still missing some much needed things (post game lobbies, better character selector menu, abuse reporting, tutorials for game modes/characters) that a MOBA should have. The lack of polish on certain things such as El Dragon's body slam, or the UI make the game look and feel like it is in beta.  The screen clutter problem and balance issues are extremely overstated, visual effects can be a little overwhelming at first but it grows on you. Contrary to what people say, the game has plenty of content, and the character design ranges from good to utterly fantastic.   I never thought the humor in the Borderlands series was very good, and as BB is a Gearbox game the humor ranges from pretty funny to cringe city. I do find the humor to overall be much better than the Borderlands games.  If you liked Monday Night Combat, you'll love it. If you like MOBAS and FPSs, you'll probably like it.   Obligatory Overwatch comparison: They are not really comparable and both are fantastic. But I will mention that Overwatch IS a more polished game in terms of design and shooting mechanics. Battleborn offers a deeper gameplay experience with progression and single player. Battleborns games are much longer and more methodical, everything (including minions) takes much longer to kill. If you like instant gratification shooters with the kill/die/respawn formula, Battleborn is probably not your cup of tea.",

            "review_text": "Battleborn is a diamond hidden in a forest. With the storm of 'hero shooters' flooding the game market (which this was the first one to be announced, just sayin') Battleborn has gotten the short end of the stick.   Just what is Battleborn though? As mentioned before, Battleborn is of the new genre of games coming out recently, a hero shooter. Battleborn has 25 playable heroes (5 more DLC characters to come post launch, completely free) that you can play in three different competitive multiplayer gamemodes (two maps per mode) or in a full length co-op story campaign (up to 5 players).    Story-  In Battleborn, you're in a war against Rendain with his Jennerit Empire and Varelsi allies to save the last star in the universe: Solus. There are eight story missions that can be played on Normal or Advanced difficulty with the added option of enabling hardcode mode (only one life per player). Each mission will take you about 30-60 minutes to complete depending on what difficulty you are on and how many people are playing. Additional lore about the game can be unlocked by completing character lore challenges- specific tasks you have to perform with various different characters.   Multiplayer-  If the story mode doesn't tickle your fancy, there's also the competitive multiplayer. In Incursion, the mode that makes everyone think Battleborn is a MOBA (it's not), you are fighting to destroy the two enemy spider sentry bots. You'll have to escort your own minions to their sentry to disable the shields- but that's far easier said than done. Or you could play in Meltdown, where you need to feed your own minions into a robotic grinder that thinks it commands the universe. Lastly, if you just want to get some quick action you can play in Capture, which is pretty much just domination from COD.   Progression-  Don't think that's all, though. In each multiplayer match and story mission, you will level up your character and select different augments that power up your abilities. By playing matches you will also level up your   character rank   which will unlock skins and more augments for your character. In addition by simply playing the game you will level up your   command rank   which unlocks loot packs, loadouts, gear, and more.   Gear- What's that? Gear? There's still more?! That's right- you can also take gear into battle that powers up your character. However, your gear will be unactivated at the beginning of each match. To activate it you must collect 'shards', the currency of the universe. But there's a catch-- those shards are also used to build tactical battle structures on the map, so choose what you buy wisely. Gear comes in various rarities and can be gained by buying loot packs (with in-game credits only, no microtransactions), by getting loot drops in the story mode, by completing challenges, or by leveling up any of your various ranks.   Conclusion-  If you couldn't tell already, this game has incredible depth. This is the factor that distinguishes Battleborn from every other game on the block. Battleborn is a COMPLETE package, worth the $60 in full. Battleborn has NO microtransactions or DLC that will affect the competitive scene (the only DLC will be story missions and cosmetics). If you wish to see how different the game is gameplay-wise from every other MOBA or hero-shooter out there, you should perhaps look at TotalBiscuit's overview of the game. That's about all for my review though. Battleborn? 10/10.",

Sure, players were scarce, and it usually took around 10 minutes to find a game, but the actual gameplay was fun!  I deleted the game a while back because it was dead. And I mean dead. It became harder to find games, and the only people playing it were level 100s! Every game I eventually got into was unbalanced, generally with an opposing team of all 100s due to the party system.   I guess singleplayer is still playable, though for me singleplayer is kinda repeptitive. All the charm of the Borderlands games is there, though.  If there were still people playing this game, I would happily recommend this. Sadly, it is hard to find a game, and is not worth the price tag.",

Buy it, Play it, it is a quality game.  I know there is an obligatory statement that this is not overwatch, which is true. But a better way to put it is, this is not a traditional first person game at all. All of the gameplay tropes of FPS's are thrown to the wind; this is, in my opinion, all for the better. People go into the game with a standard FPS attitude, assuming its all micro personnal skill, and no team-strategy.  Battleborn asks you to make good decisions, and punishes you for making bad ones. This is the true factor that it brings from MOBA's. People complain about balance? I don't want to be that guy that say's 'git gud!' but instead i'll say, don't be bad. Dying matters, and keeping yourself from dying is actually possible. This is not a game where you seige until you die, or defend until the seige gives up. It asks you to be smart.  I've played characters where i just felt like i was horrible at playing it, or maybe even had the though that the character was just bad in general. But then prescious moments happen and i realize how well the game is designed. I will think hard and figure out a strategy for a character, and it clicks. I start wrecking. Another weird piece of satisfaction is where i've given up on a character because i think they are bad... but then i see on the enemy team playing it. I get destroyed. The game keeps you on your toes, You can't just get good with one character, you have to get good VS other characters. How do i beat them? When is a bad time not to go in? When is it a good time to charge into difficult odds?  Just try it, The coop is fun, especially with friends, the PvP is amazing and has a great feel to it.

These are 2 complete different games and the way the newest Gearbox masterpiece handles in gameplay and replayability is outstanding! Yes there are still a few bugs but these are surely going to be fixed.   The gamemodes are great. You got your Borderlands-esque story, where you have to save the last star in the known universe from being destroyed, and your PVP modes. The story is both aviable for single and multiplayer(up to 5). In the PvP section there are 3 modes, the traditional Capture and 2 new ones. The first is Incursion. A mixture of tower defense with minions where it's your goal to destroy the two guardians od the enemy team. The last mode is meltdown. This is completely new to me. Here you have to escort your minions to a shredder like machine where they are going to be destroyed and at the half of your aim the position of the machine changes.  Thus there is a huge variety in PvP. Sadly there are only 2 maps per gamemode at the moment but there are going to be more implemented into the game within the next months. For free.   For free, that's a good point, because there are going to be 5 more Battleborn characters going to be released. Each for the price of having the basic game and more maps will be here soon as well.  I've played this game a couple hours already and I'm surprised how much I like it. It's by far one of my favourite games at the moment and I'm sure I'm going to play this till the end of Solus ;)",

I've never played LoL, DOTA or SMITE and apart from a basic understanding of 'lanes' my knowledge of the genre is pretty limited. So when I heard that Battleborn, a MOBA/FPS game with some raid/dungeon elements, was open for testing I had to see what it was all about. My usual genres of choice are FPS / MMORPGS and Battleborn seems to take the most fun elements of both and combines them together with the fundamental nature of the MOBA.  And here we are, and what a glorious place we find ourselves in. The artistic direction of this game is brilliantly conceived. It's almost as though an Anime cartoonist and a LSD enthusiast had a brainstorming session resulting in this gloriously fun and vibrant parallel dimension. The environments, characters, planets, gameplay, AI and overall universe Gearbox have created is both genius and painstakingly consistent. The whole game feels like an epic labour of love with absolutely no room for compromise.  The story campaign, which can be played either solo or co-operatively, is most reminiscent of your typical WoW dungeon and - in some scenarios - raid! The encounters take all the best game mechanics of a top notch instanced experience and combine it with some of the most fast, furious and colourful FPS action you've ever experienced. The result is... Magical...  Then we have the true heart of Battleborn, the versus mode, where players have the choice of three different game modes: Incursion (defend base, attack enemy case) Capture (hold objectives) and Meltdown (escort friendly minions to enemy base). Each gametype is offers a different player experience, but the true magic here is in the variety of characters to choose from, and the way in which you develop them as they level up and eventually rank up.  I could go on and on about the rewarding item system, the in-game level up choices, the individuality of each character and how the game constantly screams quality, reminding me of the best aspects of all the games I love... But I won't.  All I will say is this: Don't expect an Overwatch clone - this is completely different and in the best way possible. Don't expect a typical dungeon/raid experience - Battleborn takes the best mechanical aspects of both and runs with them. Don't expect a MOBA replacement - treat this more as a compliment to the MOBA genre. Above all: Expect a beautifully crafted game, with a stunning landscape, solid characters, compelling gameplay, genius AI enounters and some of the best art direction you've ever experienced.",

The lore unlocks you get and dialogue snippets you hear mid-game re: the cast are all delightful.  I don't think it's fair to compare Battleborn to other games; it's honestly its own thing and it's very much worth playing as such. I've found it pleasantly addictive, and when you get in with the right people both the PvP maps and the story missions are great fun to dig into.

            "review_text": "Hi there folks!   Battleborn, Released on may the 2nd. (PC(STEAM)/XBONE/PS4) Created by Gearbox Software, the ones who brought you Half-Life expansions ( e.g. Opposing Force, Blue Shift,... ), Borderlands series and Duke Nukem series.  Battleborn is a game, a mix between 'moba' gameplay and a bit of Borderlands. This game is an exciting FPS, whereas like a moba game, has 25 playable 'heroes' to choose from. Characters ranging from melee to long-range weaponary. (with different skills/traits) Ofcourse most of these 'heroes' are locked and you can unlock them by doing challenges or by rank/level. You can level up your player rank, but also your 'heroes' can be leveled.  My first impressions are that this game is not a MOBA at all. It's just 'based' on. Meaning, if you are not so into moba's (like me), you can still enjoy this game to the fullest. With a humour in style of Borderlands, this game is pretty fun. There are enough characters to explore and after checking them all, i'm sure you'll find the character you want to play with.  This game has a story-mode game. Although in my opinion, the story isn't really interesting. It does give some sort of clue, in what kind of universe you are playing in. The cinematics are a mix of animated american manga/cartoons.  The game has a very fast matchmaking, so if you do not want to play alone, you can easily join up with up to 4 other players. Storymode can be played in co-op with friends or other random players. There are 3 other PVP modes: Meltdown (arena mode), Incursion (destroy enemy base) and Devastion (capture the flag).  Also a part of the game are lootboxes. You can find them after defeating bosses in storymode, leveling up and ofcourse by buying them. These lootboxes includes Items that enrich your character's skills. You can only choose 3 active 'powers' that you can activate while playing. These are not character-bound.  This game offers a decent gameplay, loads to explore and a lot of choice in playable characters. Music &amp; voices are great. Although I missed a good story here, the gameplay is as great as playing Borderlands (loads of shooting). And the good/fast matchmaking is really something.  I give this game a 8/10",

If that doesn't bother you and you like unlocking characters as you go, by all means! - The community is somewhat small so some nights it is hard to find a PvP match. If you are always playing with friends, it completely alleviates this however. - The game is often compared to Overwatch; I believe this is unfair. If you play them both you'll see they are very different games. Gearbox shouldn't have marketed it as an Overwatch competitor imo, but here we stand. I play both and enjoy them for very different reasons. - There is a premium currency store, it is exclusively cosmetics, and they are GORGEOUS. If you are against paid cosmetics, learn about ROI on development time vs art time. Also they are COMPLETELY OPTIONAL.  I love this game, give it a shot if you're on the fence about it.",

Just to point out something: CoD has done this same crap for its last I don't know how many games now.

            "review_text": "First, a disclosure: The Overwatch comparisons are pretty stupid. I don't get how a modernized version of TF2 needs to be set on a pedestal looking down on a FPS MOBA. I get they were released within a month but, seriously.  Another disclosure: HUGE Gearbox fanboy. Borderlands is one of my favorite game series of all time, hundreds of hours put in on XBox 360 and on Steam. So naturally I'm excited about Battleborn to start.  I love this game. I put 250+ hours into it for a reason. But it's not for everyone, especially not in the early months of release.  First, positives. This game has 26 available characters as of this writing and is planning on an additional 4 characters up to a total of 30. Pretty damn big for an FPS. In addition these characters are, for the most part, wildly different, with varying degrees of supports and assassins with vastly different personalities. Like, one of my mains is a walking block of ice. How cool is that! All of these characters, like most things in this game (which I'll cover), take time to learn. It's a very deep and enlightening experience learning a character and utilizing the best gear and helix (since you upgrade your abilities in skill trees in-game). In addition, the game offers story mode, which is more than can be said about other MOBAs. Then you have colorful environments, rich humor (although the bleeped-out profanity probably isn't necessary), and engaging and competitive multiplayer. It's everything I wanted and got. Unfortunately, no game is without it's flaws, and as much as I wanna say it's perfect, it's not.  Let's just get one thing out of the way: If you're looking for another game that provides a pure MOBA experience, look somewhere else. The game modes available right now are not really anywhere close to modes offered by League or DOTA. Also, Battleborn games typically play out in ways that traditional MOBA players aren't used to. For example, the concept of needing to kill creeps before they reach the objective is still present, but with multiple fortifications that can be built or destroyed. Many players will need to put at least a few games to fully learn what is involvedin winning games and what can make the difference.  The other thing I want to stress is that Battleborn is constantly being updated and tweaked as it progresses, with some very notable flaws that will hopefully be addressed in further patches. For example, right now the game isn't available on Mac or Linux (I think); players in the far east will have a horrible time trying to find matches unless they change their region settings in Steam to NA or EU; Battleborn suffers from improper balancing in terms of gear and characters from a competitive standpoint (looking at you, Alani); and it's not very well optimized on PC, leading to frequent frame-rate drops without some .ini file tweaking.   Gearbox is looking into ALL of this, though. This is a game they've been working on before Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel came out. It's a pet project and people know it.   Now, this review could change in a few months based on what happens, since it's currently seeing decreasing playerbase, and we don't specifically know what Gearbox is going to do. However, if you're willing to deal with the game's flaws in kind, if you want to play a game that is unlike any you've ever played and will challenge you in almost every category, I strongly recommend giving Battleborn a whirl, at the very least when it goes on sale.",

If people would just look past the whole 'Overwatch clone' thing and give it a try, they might actually enjoy it.  The PvE mode is fun, and you can play it with a group or solo if you wish, though I would recoomend playing it with a group.  The queue time for PvP can take a while. Some people have complained that they've waited for upto 30 minutes for a game. Me? I've really only waited about 3-5 minutes on avereage, so it's best to play during peak times or on the weekends.   Also, the notion that the game is 'dead' is pretty misleading, given that I have little trouble finding games. I'm not sure if these people are playing at really odd times or are just REALLY impaitent.  Yes, there is a microtransaction store in this, but it's only for cosmetic items, such as skins and taunts, and the store itself is burried away in the gear tab, so it isn't front and centre when you start the game up. Say what you will about microtransactions in paid games, but no one is forcing you to buy that stuff, so you can't complain.  My only complaints are some optimisation issues, not to mention a pretty bad game crash when I first started the game up, but that was fixed after a system restart and hasn't happened again since (I think it was a Windows 10 problem more than anything).  If you enjoy MOBAs or enjoyed the Borderlands series, you should deffinately give this game a look.",

It is not as Moba as smite nor as shooter as MNC but some nice balance in the middle. The characters are diverse and the game modes are fun. Though I havent had a chance to play the capture point mode at this time. The story mode has some legs with its variable banter between characters and the NPCs of the missions changing depending on who is involved. Their are also challenges and different difficulty settings that make them replayable. I see at least 15-20 hours in the campaign before new stories get added with DLC. On the subject of DLC and what WILL be DLC from what I gathered it is the followoing. We will be getting 5 more characters added to the game for free some time after launch. The season pass adds instant access to those characters while those without will have to unlock them their normal way (either from reaching certain rank checkpoints, playing against certain characters in PvP/PvE, or just winning so many games, usually their is 2 ways to unlock each character). The upcoming paid DLC seems to be more story missions.  Some negatives since their are a couple. I think optimizations needs to be worked on a bit. Their is some delay that I think I fixed by messing around with the settings. The game is quite challenging in multiplayer and it is easy to feel like you arent doing much untill you come to understand exactly what is going on.",

I am NOT comparing Battleborn to Overwatch, simply because they are nothing alike. Besides the graphics, and the fact that they're both FPS's, they are two TOTALLY different games. So, keep that in mind as you are reading this review, that I will NOT be comparing the two games. I'm also not saying that Overwatch is bad, either, so dont start thinking that.  In Battleborn, you are, well, the Battleborn, and your job is to stop Rendain and the Jennerits from rebuilding the Heliophage, and destroying the last star, Solus. In some ways, this game is very similar to the Borderlands games, which I absolutly LOVED. The campaign can be difficult at times, and may require you to go and do the campaign online. Now, the campaign isn't that long: only 8 missions. However, each mission can take up to about 30 mins, so your time and money isn't being wasted. Each mission has the chance to unlock a new character. Characters can be obtained 1 of 3 ways: by completing a challenge, by reaching a certain rank, or beating a mission that unlocks said character.  Now, let's move on to the PvP aspect of the game. There are 3 different modes of PvP: Capture, witch is your standard capture area and hold it for a certain amount of time, Incursion, which is just destroy the enemies base, and Meltdown, but it's basically, you have to sacrifice your minions to a god, which is actually unique.

Battleborn is Dota meets FPS in terms of game play not just by having heroes instead of classes. It is rough around the edges, and certainly has its problems, but it is a refreshingly different game play from your classic team based FPS by focusing very much on coordinated objective centered game play in a variety of Moba inspired game modes.  Gearbox have already announced that they're currently internally playtesting a variety of new maps and are planning on adding at least one more multiplayer game mode, ranked matchmaking, better spectating and a whole bunch of other stuff.  Yes, it is not as polished as the other big upcoming 'hero shooter', yes it's not as amazing as it could be (and should be) but at the moment Battleborn offers FPS game play you won't find anywhere else and it does so in a solid and enjoyable fashion (at least for me as an FPS fan and someone who always liked the tactical depth of Mobas but never could get into them) and is promising to get better in the future.",

            "review_text": "Looking for a real review and not one of those cry baby troll ones? Well that's what I'm gonna give to you. In fact, I'm gonna lay out the key points at the beginning so when you scroll and see this you won't have to read for an eternity. I'll expand more later on in the review.  Key Points: - Not Overwatch. Much slower and strategy based. - Its a MOBA, not an FPS. - Its more team based in my opinion. - Its a MOBA, so yes it is repetitive. But so is Overwatch so, yea. - Not all the problems are universal. Nearly all the major ones (game runs poorly on AMD, long queue times) I have never had. - Seriously, its not Overwatch. Stop comparing them. - Its only unbalanced if you don't talk to your team. A team of three snipers isn't going to work as well as a team with a diverse cast of classes. -Yes, some of the classes are OP. But they have gotten way better. Believe me. The biggest thing wrong with this game to begin with is the mentality going into it. You might be expecting Borderlands. Don't. The only things they share is the art style and the humor. That's it. Don't expect it to be just a FPS with RPG elements, this game is a MOBA. The fact that MOBA is not the first tag is misleading cause at its core that's what it is.   Next, I have seen many people compare it to Overwatch and all of them have the intelligence of a wet paper towel. They are two completely games and even play styles. As someone who owns both and loves both games, I don't see how they can compare them through any other relationship besides they are video games set in the first person.   Okay, so getting into it I'll try to address some problems some others have had. 1) Optimization. Some people who are running this game on an AMD card have been having problems so much so that it seems everyone who has it has the problem. Not true. I have an AMD graphics card and CPU and my game runs just fine at max settings. So just because you have an AMD card doesn't mean it will run bad, the game does have optimization issues but I never had any. 2) Matchmaking is too long. Never had to wait longer than like two minutes and that was when the player base was like 800. Its a regional thing. 3) Getting matched against level 100s. Skill has no part in the levels. That just means they have played the game long enough that the experience from each match just piled up. An better indicator of skill would be their title. If there title is one that can only be obtained by getting a team kill three times in one match, then yea, that's skill. I have went up against low levels, 2-9, and got stomped. People get high levels because they are the ones who just kept playing it when no one did. So there will be a hard learning curve but I have seen many people help newcomers in game with learning what everything is. And Battleborn is not the only game like this, play just about any other game that has an online mode and you'll see the same thing. Best example, Call of Duty. 4) Microtransactions. Boohoo, cry about it. Seriously, every game does it because people will buy them. They don't even give you an edge in combat, they are just for looks. Calm down. 5) Where's my special stuff for buying the game full price/buying the season pass/preordering?? You chose to buy the game. You could have waited. All games have the chance to flop at the start. Its a risk you take when you buy a game, any game really. I bought this game day one and the season pass but you don't see me crying for special treatment.   I could go on but I won't. I love this game for its humor and style. I enjoy the communication it requires and the coordination. The characters are great and the concept is wonderful. Its a MOBA so its gonna take at least 15 minutes minimum. You can't just run it and murder the other team. Killing is harder than Overwatch and takes more skill. I recommend it. If you are still shakey about the game, just know that some of the best games that I have ever played have had a vast array review types from negative to overwhelmingly positive. Just do your research and see if you like what you see.",

A bunch of groups are defending it and keeping the last light on, while the Jennerit, a race from the planet Tempest, are set to see it destroyed (they're basically Vampires honestly :v) You, a Battleborn, are sent on a quest to stop their plan, and let nothing in your path hold you down before taking them down.   Or of course, do Versus and have some 5v5 Battleborn orgy action by ripping into other players and emerging on top!

            "review_text": "  so I wanted to rewrite my review because my old review left out a lot of stuff.  In Battleporn you play as one of 25 playable heroes (as of this review) and fight against other people.  There are currently only three modes in the online multiplayer to choose from  Incursion Teams of heroes must defend their base from waves of AI-controlled minions while working together alongside their own minions to destroy their opponent's base.  Capture Teams of heroes face off in a fast-paced death match and must capture and hold objectives on the map to win.  Meltdown Teams of heroes must guide their minions as they march to their death at the center of the map. Points are scored for every minion who throws themselves into the incinerator, and the team with the most points wins.  I've only gotten to experience Incursion and Capture (Meltdown couldn't find any games, so I'm assuming it's the least popular of the three) and the most fun in my opinion is Capture.  Being a player coming from Overwatch and TF2 I have to say this game feels...good  The controls are smooth and comfortable and the gameplay is relatively easy to pick up.  Characters -- I'm the type of guy who doesn't bother remembering the names of characters when I start games. I like to come up with names for characters that describe that character perfectly. um Halloween Girl (Orendi) is pretty cool, probably my main and she's good for area coverage.  Bubblegum Lumberjack (Montana) isn't a character I can play as.  Shroom guy (See what I did there!? Shroom guy!? Doom guy!? except he isn't like doom guy in any way!) (Miko) is the main healer and a good one too.  Fancy Robot Buttercup (Marquis) is a brilliant sniper and can help take out groups of players in mere seconds  Edgy Vampire Lord (Rath) is the edgiest character and that's all that needs to be said.  Girl who saves our asses every game (Reyna) saves our asses every game!  Emo teen girl (Shayne and Aurox) is really Emo and throws the blades that she cuts herself with at anyone who denies her emoness   Oscar Mike (Oscar Mike) needs no name, he just needs his voice lines.  that's it ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯   the game is really fun and more people should play it!  definitely better with friends!  EDIT: After playing a lot more of the game, I have a new perspective on the game modes.  Incursion is still the most popular of the three, having the most players in queue.  I actually have been playing a lot more Meltdown and I have to say, it is really fun! It turns battleborn into a MOBA like game as you escort your minions to certain goals and attempt to stop enemy minions from doing the same. Overall it's probably my second favorite as of this review.  Haven't really played a lot of Capture since I wrote this review, but it's still a pretty fun gamemode if you ask me.  And finally, the online Campaign. The online Campaign is extremely enjoyable with friends! I definitely recommend you and a friend get on and raise hell for Rendain!!",

The game takes alot of farming to get good gear and to level up characters, while you need to play with peopel to get better items and more xp. As you can see the lack of players affects this. Also It would be better if the developers put new maps and missions vs AI, Maybe a moon or somethign as a new world to fight on as there are only 3 Ekkinar, Tempast, and Bliss atm. Right now this game is a 6.5/10 for me when the developers fix the problems with Micro-transactions being in a $60 game and add more than just skins and taunts that can only be bought then I could give this game and 8-8.5/10.

The mechanics are great, and each of the 8 stages plays out like a mini-dungeon run featuring either point defense/horde, escort, or just great boss fights. The MOBA-style in-mission leveling and variety of characters keeps each run feeling fresh, and the advanced difficulty runs are just challenging enough to keep things interesting.   Add that to the pretty fun PvP modes, and it's a great package for the price.  My only complaint would be that the humor is, in my opinion, a little forced. But it has its moments.

Before I played it I heard some mixed feedback, so I figured why the hell not. Might as well make my own opinion about actual game.  But booooy good thing I did.  My initial focus was on multiplayer pvp, since that will be the deciding factor in long run. At first I was bit overwhelmed by all those explosions, robots, explosions, death. However since I am used to Borderlands I quickly got hang of it.   ...  10 hours later.  ...  Yeah this game is quite charming. The leveling is fluid, but does not reward you for doing nothing (Hots comes to mind), the shooting is bit arcady but fun. The cast of heroes is wide enough for anybody to pick class fiting their gamestyle, be that hardcore FPS player or casual rpg person. Humor is ... well ... bit more elegant than borderlands was. What makes this game so good is leveling of helix (notably changes how your character works - works similar as HOTS leveling), combined with 3 pieces of gear you can select in gear menu (somehow LOLish). Gear is droped from loot packs (you can buy em for ingame currency from 'market' -&gt; no microtransactions) or drop in PVE mode.  All and all this game is excellent FPS/MOBA/HERO SHOOTER. There is going bit of badmouthing coming from Overwatch players, who need to justify they buy by tossing sh..eets on Battleborn. However those 2 games are TOTALY DIFFERENT FPS GENRES. (Can not stress this enough)  Pros: - Fun PVP modes (2 moba-esque and 1 domination - 2 maps each mode) - Lots of characters to choose from (25 and 5 are coming) - New content is coming - Leveling of account, leveling of each character (unlocks skins, taunts and more helix options) - Easy to learn, hard to master (Helix leveling, gear choice and party composition make every match different) - PVP maps/modes will be free for every owner of basic game  Cons: - It is not Overwatch (con for some) - Servers seem bit unstable - PvE Co-op could be bit better (it isnt exactly bad, but you would expect more from borderlands creators) - PvE content will be gated by season pass",

It’s basically a borderlands take on a multiplayer FPS MOBA with some really cool gear and hero progression. There is also really cool co-op “instances” which tell a neat story when played with others in a series. It’s a lot of bang for your buck. The intrinsic replayablity of a MOBA game is greatly enhanced by the unlock system, rewards, and story.  While it is a Great game, unfortunately, this game suffers from head to head competition with the Marketing Gorilla which is the Warcraft funded uber conglomerate known as Blizzard. Due to this battleborn may not be able to maintain the player base it needs to survive in the future.  Battleborn Pro’s:  It's a REAL MOBA, it has ai minions, a form of junggling, and mercenary’s, it also has MOBA “like“ mode without ai minions just like Overwatch (if that's your thing).  It has a full single story co-operative campaign (think pug instances in Warcraft).  It has gear, usable in all modes, which you earn from playing!  It has a ton’s of unlockable hero’s which are unlockable by play and sometimes just given away. (alot of hero's awarded for first mission)  It has stories with great voice work in a Borderlands flavor.  Battleborn’s Con’s:  Overwatch 'may' lead to an eventual death spiral of bleeding players...  Solution! BUY IT NOW, ENJOY IT BEFORE ITS TOO LATE...  ;)   ",

            "review_text": "*So Far, Soooooo Good!*  TLDR: Battleborn is a great competitve FPS, full of various flavors of combat, skill building, and strategy. If you like Borderlands, the humor is there, if you enjoy a fast paced kill-fest, this is for you, if you get off on the MOBA equipment meta-game, you might want to stick with LOL, HON, or Smite. Overall, a fantastic effort by Gearbox. 8/10.  I had had my eye on Battleborn for a number of months before the open beta. As a veteran of numerous FPS's and MOBA's, the combination of the two had me salivating to say the least. In all fairness, I pre-ordered before the open beta; what can I say? I like to roll the dice every once in a while. I'm happy to report that they came up 7s this time! While I'm not too terribly big on co-op multiplayer, the missions offer something to play with my friends that are, and further, it entices them to come into the online arena to use the loot the gather in the co-op missions.  The PvP is fast paced and fun. Though there may be some balance issues to be worked out, and perhaps the overall player 'score' should maybe be relabled 'threat' (apparently your score has really no value outside of increasing your spawn time when killed, as read on reddit, not confirmed) overall the matches are frentic with an air of strategery that you scarcely can find in any other modern FPS. Match this with the inherent Gearbox style and you have yourself a winner that is bound to eat up at least a hundred hours of my time. If you're on the fence, jump off. This game will grab you and keep you coming back for more.",

It is a great game for people who enjoy the Borderlands franchise or just wants to something to do until Borderlands 3 is released. This game has singleplayer mode where you complete a campaign similar to Borderlands where you fight bosses and other things. The Multiplayer game modes are capture: where you capture points and guard them, Incursion: where you take down the 2 enemy sentries, and Meltdown: which is similar to a moba but you will not be attacking the enemy's base. There are 25 playable character in the game currently everything from a talking penguin in a mec suit to a Fan wielding master assassin and more! Most of them require you to complete a certain challenge or reach a commander rank to unlock.   Some things that bother me is that the matchmaking system takes way to long and is pretty unbalanced. Even with those 2 things I am really happy with the game. I've been waiting for Battleborn to come out ever since it got first announced and when I first played the open beta is this game just exceeded my standards and the actual release of the game exceeds even more. This game deserves a chance instead of getting put down by people who want Borderlands 3 or the Overwatch Fans. Over all Battleborn is a fantastic game and people who enjoy Borderlands or MOBAs, or FPS should definitely check this game out and try it because it might become your new favorite game who knows.",

People are arguing that they need to learn the game; If all it takes is for someone to run up and hack and slash and kill you more than half the time, I would say there are some issues.  - Matchmaking is not very good; almost always will not have a good spread of command rank. I do understand that players cannot be evenly spread all the time but to atleast have some consistency would be nice. - Lack of staying with a party. Very rarely I will find myself playing with a nice group of people who openly communicate and play as a team, but cannot play another game with them because you have to re enter matchmaking everytime you win/lose a game.  - Lack of multiplayer maps and content. Hopefully dlc will fix but this is definately not $60 worth of content. - Scoring in multiplayer needs to emphasis objectives. Too many people thinking kills &gt; objectives. - Campaign is a little lackluster and seems rushed. Not a real vareity in gameplay. You're either defending something with waves or just escorting. Where is the creativity that was in borderlands 2?  Overall I would recommend this game despite the huge list of cons because I do see the potential that this game has.

It's like a comedy version of Borderlands, with loony AIs, gentleman robots and space elves. +The co-op campaign is rather fun (if short). +The intro video and cut scenes are cartoonish and great fun to watch.  Cons: -It's a game about 1) PVP - using your three abilities to punish the opposing players in three game modes 2) PvE - Using your three abilities to beat a rather easy coop campaign with.. six stages? Five? You can complete them all in 3 hours and from then on it's just repetition. -Matchmaking is random. Utterly random. You can end up with five lvl 2 teammates trying to kill all lvl30+ opponents. It's oh so random. Oh, and if someone decides to flee your lowbie team before the match starts, then, well, that's YOUR problem. -This might be just me, but I sort of resent the fact that the single player campaign has NOTHING to do with the PvP. The single player campaign is campy but fun story about freeing heroes and saving the last remnants of the universe. And then you... start killing those heroes you just saved in a really weird arena setting where you have to hold flags or sacrifice robots?

If a comparison is made to overwatch you can stop reading because the review will not be worth your time. Any comparison made to the game is ignorant and more often than not made by someone who hasn't tried battleborn.  The game has MOBA like pvp, 3 modes, 2 maps each, with gear and buildables.  A story mode with 8 levels each allowing gear and credit collection while getting xp for yourself and characters.  Each of the 26 characters can level up to 15 and every level will give you something either for the character or as a loot pack. They also have 5 lore challenges each to work towards unlocking to get more info on the characters. They each have a helix as well that allows 1 of 2-3 skill augments each level that last for the match up to level 10.  I reccomend this game as all the issues are being addressed. Gearbox has put out an update each week since its launch to tweak balances and modes.   This games marketing was very little, and the ignoramuses comparing it to overwatch have also hindered it, but battleborn is worth a try, especially now that it's discounted.

There's no real story or arc just reasons to have waves of enemies and boss fights, but the short animation was a fun touch. The balanced matches in PvP are too few and playing in an unbalanced match is just frustrating. Characters are locked behind a progression wall, like in a F2P game. No ultrawide monitor support - the game plays OK but menus are baked at 1920x1080. There are moments of fun, especially with the right group. Sadly, in pick-up games you can't progress with the same people to next levels.  It's just awkward and uncohesive; I'd get a refund if I could and wait until it was $15.

And it is similar to Borderlands (humor.. ^^). The only point i don't really like is that you always need a internet connection, but this is not so important.  So, my result is that I give Battleborn a 10/10, not a 11/10 but 10/10 :) Buy it, play it and have fun! #BorderlandsLove #ThanksGearbox",

Those who jumped on Overwatch without playing this (they are different styles of games). And those who wanted Borderlands 3 and didn't really understand the goal of this game.  There are flaws, but I don't find them to be with the game itself. The community is small which does make bad queue times. That's a self fulfilling prophecy. People don't get it simply for a queue time so they never get better. The gear system does require some grinding, but unless you're playing at super high ELO gear doesn't matter.

I was very pleasantly surprised to find a high skill cap shooter (or melee-er) with multiple fun modes that could be built out. Very highly recommend for PC gamers and veteran shooter players.

PVE battles are relatively decent with 8 missions total (9 if you count the prologue) but hardly makes the game stand out on it's own.

The PvP has 3 modes which all feel and play differently: a tight space close quarter skirmish to destroy two enemy objectives while preserving yours, large map minion delivery to the enemy portals for the points, and a point capture without any minions at all - just pure hero on hero action.

Gearbox themselves stated that it cost more to develop this game than it did for both Borderlands 1 and 2 combined. To me, Battleborn proves that this statement was either a lie, or just evidence on how terrible Gearbox is at developing games, leaving Borderlands 2 as just a fluke.   ---  The grind in the game is terrible. Most of the base characters are fairly easy to get, but the problem comes with the DLC characters. It takes longer to unlock a new Battleborn with credits than it does to grind for a character in League of Legends or Heroes of the Storm, two other MOBA's which are both free to play. If you're going to base your AAA game on other MOBA's, why not be more like Dota2 and at least unlock all the non-DLC characters from the start? Why throw in so many microtransactions into a game that was originally sold for $60-80?   Matchmaking is atrocious, both because there are so few people playing, and because of the asinine way it forms groups. Creating a group of 5 random players and then pitting them against another group of 5 often leads to imbalanced teams and makes it a nightmare if someone happens to leave queue in the middle of it. It'd be much wiser for the game to instead look for 10 people and then just split them evenly between teams.  I hate the lack of vision and visual cues in the game. The FoV and the game being in first person works against it being a MOBA. SMITE does being a shooter-MOBA better largely because it is third person. You can see more of what is going on in SMITE.  The sound design is abysmal, many sound effects either being too quiet, unfitting, or nonexistant. The fact that a character like Montana can stomp on the ground so hard that nearby enemies are launched into the air, yet not make a sound is truly bizarre to me. Then you have instances like the spider-like sentry bots whose machine guns sound more like airsoft rifles. Of all the problems I've listed, this has oddly been the one that bothers me the most.  There are more modes than many other games in the same genre, even a single player campaign. But they all feel lackluster and unpolished, showing that neither multiplayer nor singleplayer got enough attention. Gearbox was more focused on including so many things, yet not making them all that great to begin with.   But the biggest problem I had, which is very serious.  This game has actually damaged the graphics card on my computer, and now I am going to have to get a new one.  This card has lasted me through hundreds of games, many of them being much much more graphically intensive than this. But this game has done it in. Even if you disagree with my opinions, you should still be mindful the damage this has done to my computer, and to those of others who have had similar problems.  ------  Battleborn could've been a good game, I was even hyped for it when it was first announced however long ago. But the poor decisions of the developers, and the execution of many of its elements just make it unappealing and bland. There's a reason why the game has a huge problem with player retention, and it's not just because of games like Overwatch or Paladins. Gearbox and 2k are both just as much to blame, if not more since it is their creation, especially when it came to marketing.  After they fulfill their legal obligation with the season pass, I believe they are going to cut support for this game entirely. The game will just continue to die while Randy Pitchford sits in his office singing more about nasty tweets he got on Twitter.  If you must get this game, get it on XBox. That platform at least seems to have a decent sized fanbase still, from what I understand, while PC is like someone who has been stabbed and left lying in the middle of some alleyway somewhere.",

It will match level 72 players with level 2 noobs. Great fun garanteed! You either roflstomp the enemy team or get steamrolled yourself. I can count the really close games I had with one, perhaps two fingers (admittedly, I only played around 10-15 matches or so) - Ridiculous lack of content: 2 (two) meltdown maps. This must be a joke. Plus, nobody wants to play that second map anyway, so you end up with that same map you've been playing since beta. - Characters are locked behind progress walls. I don't like this idea. I want to try out the support characters. Now I need to grind boring other characters I don't want to play in the first place to unlock these. - Story mode: so-so. Lot's of shooting, yeah. But why, what is the story? Jokes are 'meh' at best (not on the same level as Borderlands). You can clearly tell this has been added in a rush. - Gear loadout: why is it so damn difficult to build an intuitive way of managing your gear? I'm clicking, double-clicking left and right, but it's always a chore to move gear in and out of your loadouts. Also, when I select a character and his loadout, am I really supposed to learn by heart what every item does? You can only see it's icon in the character select screen.  - Please order the battleborn by their role. At this point, the game is new and a lot of people (including me) don't fully know all battleborn's role. It might help if you'd put all tanks together, all DPS characters together, and so on... - the need to grind for better loot. Ugh.    Conclusion: This game could have been a real hit, but I fear Gearbox just wanted to cram too much into one game and they ended up with a game that's only average at best. The story mode is mediocre. The multiplayer lacks content (basically just one mode and map that everybody plays). They just shot themselves in the foot with this game I fear. But hey, sales figures will probably be good, so we can expect a Battleborn 2 in a couple of years. I do hope they focus on the one thing this game really needs: good content. ",

This game is incredibly fun to play, players ♥♥♥♥♥ about server time or matchmaking, that's because there is very little players to play the game.  But to raise a good point why I don't get why people hate this game for microtransactions only now: -Blizzard has Overwatch and they are the 'competitor' of Battleborn, costs less but in my opinion has less content, this game has microtransations and no one hates on that. Still costs a nice sum of money and what you get is a ton of sprays a victory pose, emote or a skin -Valve has CS:GO and that game is even cheaper, they release new cases every now and then where you need keys to open the cases, paying money to spend more money, keys even cost as much as a TF2 key and that game is F2P -Rockstar has GTA5 and the online section has what can be considered a pay2win system, using real money to buy more online money to spend on weapons, cars, apartments, ETC  No one thinks that this game has a chance to go F2P and this premium currency is to see if it works with the current prices. So far all you can do about the currency is buy skins, taunts, loadout or bank slots.  My point with this is that unless the publisher/developer is Blizzard or Valve, the fans are willing to look away from the bad stuff and defend them until they call you names  Think about the current situation of Battleborn and use some braincells to see ways this game can keep going, like F2P. Gearbox has made purely cosmetic DLC before, no one cared then either, it's sad when calling it DLC sounds better than microtransaction, because it's mainly the same thing",

While there are legitimate issues with the game at present (queue times being the biggest drawback for me) I can't help but love this game despite it's flaws.  Pros: 1-5 player story mode with entertaining levels and writing (This game comes from the developers of the Borderlands series) A well designed 5v5 Competitive PVP with 4 game modes Very likeable and diverse roster of 29 (will be 30) characters to play, with unlockable lore challenges that help you learn to play each one and tells you more about the character and the universe they live in A supportive community willing to help new players learn A responsive dev team (most concerns raised by the community have been addressed in a timely fashion) Plans for new content (some of which has already been delivered)  Cons: Small playerbase compared to similar games Long queue times for matchmaking (mainly due to the first con) Some performance issues on a few levels (devs have made it much better than it used to be, but the issue persists) Steep learning curve (ask someone to show you the ropes or look up tips on the forums) MOBA players and FPS players alike will find things they are unfamiliar with. Knowing the unique mechanics of the game will go a long way to help you improve.  I've had a blast playing this game with friends and I'd recommend it as long as you are aware of the cons. Chances are if you've played and like any of the Borderlands games you will enjoy Battleborn. The PVE alone would be worth buying the game on a sale.",

No, not really, it was me playing the game with characters that I probably would've played firsthand even if givin the option of all the others. Now I get it if people don't want to unlock the characters and you just want to play without the hassle, and I can understand that, but you honestly just can't say a game is bad with that as a reason.  I know the balancing isn't too well done but c'mon, games like tf2 are still patching things in game because it's not perfect. No multiplayer is perfect. And the matchmaking with the levels is just something that the devs have to fix in time, but they can't do anything about the time for finding a game! I mean when only so many people are playing a game, only so many matches are going to be availible, and if you let those people who gave this game a couple of trys repel you from buying it, then your making it worse than it already was.   Look all in all, it isn't a bad game. A game is like an investment, the more people spend in it, the more the devs will spend time in it (hopefully). It's your choice but I recommend it.

Yes some heroes are a downright pita to be matched up against (early days yet to be able to give an opinion on balance updates - unlike some players I can understand we can't have a patch every other day). And yes, there urgently needs to be a way to report toxic players.  But it is fun. It's got a great single player and co-operative campaign, which may seem short at 8 missions but I've found the replayability is there and I really don't mind doing this for gear upgrades. The recent addition of Advanced matchmaking has been a godsend and I've been lucky with the PUGS I've played with. Except on The Saboteur. That mission is cancer.  Like Borderlands before it, the games oozes character. The campaign is full of the Borderlands standard of humour we've come to know and love but I think what really stands out is the characterisation of the games heroes. I've found myself doing the Lore challenges not just for the hero specific legendary gear attached but... gasp... the lore. Oscar Mike being a personal favourite.   Multiplayer wise, I've come to prefer Incursion. The games most moba-like game mode. And while I've experienced the same issues as others being matched against higher level premades I have not had any issues waiting for matches. The longest waits being on the 2-3 minute side. Hero balance is an ongoing thing and it's quite early to comment specifically on how well Gearbox is doing with this, other than there has been some balance tweaks in hotfixes already and they have shown an interest in hearing what the players have to say. I've not as much been infuriated by certain characters being overpowered but moreso with certain premade compositions (read as: I need friends and to not play alone). Obviously being moba-like, communication and co-ordination is key and a helpful pug can turn the tide against higher level premades. Sometimes. Kinda.  Performance wise I've had some hiccups on certain missions and maps. I am however playing on a low to mid range rig and with most settings at medium and AA and Physx off I've had a steady experience with fps and no other performance issues preventing me from playing and enjoying the game.  I do hope the game offers a demo or free weekend at some point as there are (and rightfully so) a lot of mixed views on this game the best way to decide if it is for you is to test the waters for yourself.  Personally, I'm having fun and while I can see why some aren't I'm deciding to keep the faith in GBX. At least for now.",

IM DONE COMPARING MY OPINION WITH SOMEONE THAT GETS PAID TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT WHILE MOST OF US HAVE REAL JOBS AND DON'T SUCK AT EM.  The fanbases for both of these games is like comparing PC to Apple.   Battleborn is more on the technical side of an fps, Overwatch kept it safe, simple and very polished  I've played both games Overwatch(OW) through beta and bought Battleborn(BB). I do not regret buying BB for a single minute. I was a huge fan of the Borderlands series and this game has a familiar feel to their style. I was impressed that Blizzard actually made a fun fps thats pretty fluid. I also felt as gameplay goes that I've played overwatch a thousand times somewhere else, wether it be capture points or protect something that slowly moves across the map. Gearbox went another direction and ventured out once again, making a first person shooter where your decisions on how to choose certains skills and traits rpg style over others to help you progress through a game. Teamwork is more vital in BB than in OW imo. I honeslty thought there was going to be more strategy in Overwatch, judging by Blizzards record. OW reminds me of 'Apple'. It's made for people who like to think, but not too much and don't like getting too technical. BB you can enhance your character if you want to put the numbers in it by weighing your pros and cons through gear and skills. It's for someone who like's to custominze their pc for their own wants and needs to get the best experience they feel they can get. BB has way more content. I think it will pick up more when it goes on sale.  I don't feel like getting into characters too much, but I like BB's better. More unique with great voice acting. I only remember playing as Bastion in OW. Latta beeps and ♥♥♥♥. I'm a lame person and feel cheesy when I still laugh at some of the dialogue in BB. I mean that in a good way.  But I won't tell you what to get. That choice is yours. My choice is for BB. I don't think OW has a lasting appeal to it. If it does, great. Guess the lesson would be never to venture far from something that's already been done before.",

It feels like you paid 40 something for the game and then you will need 40,000 to buy a PC which can run Battleborn perfectly. I have got i7 quad core, 2Gb GTX 860M, 8Gb RAM and I could not even get 45 fps with low setting.  2. This game would be better if it was F2P, because even if you bother buying the Deluxe version like me, you will realise that the Deluxe edition gives you literally nothing in game. You cant purchase heros by money, you have to play the games for like 50 hours and unlock certain achievements in order to play as the heros you want. Most of the players gave up just because they dont feel like spending so much time on this game and they are never able to play as the heros they like.   3, Crazy queue waiting time. Well, if you wanna play PvE. it is cool. But YOU WILL NEED TO WAIT FOR THE QUEUE FOR AT LEAST 10 MINS TO START A PVP GAME, eventhough PVP was so much fun.  In conclusion, I would say, it is a good game, the developers do have some good ideas, but the wrong way running it has already fked the whole game up.

That's terrible for a game just released, with the devs insisting on always on play and the fact that versus bots does not count toward any of the unlocks that are supposed to keep players interested and invested.  The game launched with 25 characters, eight story missions that can be played out of order, but still tell a cohesive narrative, three separate pvp maps and hundreds of lines of dialog and unlockables if you're into the characters. Plus they intend to give away the next five characters and dlc a handful of new misssions, taunts and costume variations.   Despite all that I still don't think it justifies the $60.00 flat base cost. The matchmaking it truly atrocious, the always online is frustrating and causes a ton of lag and I really do feel like the game needs to offer that fine balance between running a story mission and then queuing for a match or two and with the matchmaking situation as it currently stands I find myself getting more frustrated and simply turning off the game.   That's unacceptable in a title that released roughly two weeks ago.  I've definitely gotten my money's worth based solely on playtime, of which I'd say about 100 hours or so were actually playing and 30 hours of waiting in queues. But for me personally those 30 wasted hours have cropped up in the last few days and that's a disturbing trend that needs to be reversed.  Seriously just let the versus bot matches count for lore/challenge unlocks. The vast majority of things gotten are titles, costume color variants and taunts. The only thing that's really 'game changing' would be once you've mastered a character you get a personalized piece of equipment with two generic abilities and one specifically tailored toward that character. Really even getting to unlock the characters via bot matches isn't an advantage or disadvantage. I'm a mediocre pvp'er at best and outside of taking twice as many actual hours versus people with co-ordination and a sense of direction, I unlocked everyone through leveling up my command level.   As of the time of writing this review I've only now finished my first run of all the base game missions. I've still got several characters that need to be unlocked under challenges by actually completing various objectives, even though I've had everyone unlocked for days now purely from simply enjoying the hell out of the game.  Seriously though, they need to fix the matchmaking and/or offer alternatives. The game isn't nearly as much fun when you can't get into the multiplayer maps and you don't want to run one of the very few, fairly challenging on the lowest difficulty (I'm a filthy casual though) that can take between 30 and 90 minutes to complete solo versus a pvp map that has a 30 minute timer.   If they can get some quality of life fixes in then I do recommend the game if you like that Borderlands style humor. The universe they've created is IMHO entertaining, colorful and just a ton of fun and considering how many generic brown shooters have been flooding the market for years, that alone is such a wonderful change. If they can't get those quality of life changes in before the playerbase gives up on them then I'd wait for a giant sale and group buy the game and turn it into a party challenge or something.   Regardless I don't think they offered enough stability and content for a base $60 price tag. With the matchmaking challenges the game feels like it's already showing sagging seams. Everything needs to work for the full smorgasboard effect, if one side is broken, it's hard to stay invested or interested because grinding what you can manage to solo starts to feel like a chore. If they'd priced it at $40.00 and the $20.00 season pass I think that would have been more than passable provided everything was working correctly.  Since there is no middle road I'm giving the game a tentative thumbs up simply because I truly love the universe and characters, but I really hope the devs can pull it together. I'd like to see more content and characters.   ",

            "review_text": "Many years ago, a company called Uber Entertainment released a game called Monday Night Combat. MNC was a third person MOBA, where the player played the role of a gladiatorial athlete/clone in a stylized future sport. I loved this game and it's sequel, Super Monday Night Combat, but neither game really had much staying power. The games still exist, but the lobbies are mostly empty, and I've been left with a terrible itch.  Thank you, Gearbox. You have scratched and satisfied that itch with Battleborn.  I love this game. I love smashing bots. I love pushing up the lanes. I love experimenting with loadouts and the helix skills to find that perfect Orendi or Alani or Oscar Mike build. I love the back and forth of a good 30 minute verses match. In comparison to another hero-based shooter that came out a month after Battleborn, the matches are much more satisfying, like a holiday meal in comparison to a couple candy bars.  It's also nice to see a company get microtransactions right in this sort of game. No power boosts or access to microtransaction exclusive gear. Nothing that changes the dynamic of gameplay, resulting in cries of 'pay to win.' Just taunts and skins.  If there are only two problems with the game right now, it's that it came out just before another, equally fun, better advertised hero shooter that's soaked up a lot of attention and playtime, and that the match waiting times are a touch long. Never more than five minutes, but still a touch long. I'm hoping my review may convince you to give Battleborn a chance and help swell the ranks of players to help with that last bit.",

            "review_text": "To those curious if Battleborn's issues from launch are still here:  Matchmaking - I was one of the people who never had any issues with the matchmaking, at least until the player base shrunk over these weeks. From what I've heard, the matchmaking has been getting progressively better, and Gearbox, as untrustworthy as they can be, seem to be really devoted to fixing the game's issues, and are still working and releasing more fixes and adjustments for matchmaking. Some people still have issues but it's definitely playable since launch.  Performance - A lot of performance issues have already been fixed, and most maps run fine now. Some AMD and weak card users might still have an issue with framerates, but lowering a couple settings works well, as I play with 60 fps constantly with very rare drops.  Balance - Gearbox seems to be really slow on balancing characters and gear (Not a bad thing), considering it took nearly a month before the first DLC character Alani was nerfed enough to a pretty good state. They seem to be nerfing gear really harshly, which may or may not effect people depending on your liking of the co-op/PvE side of the game. The horrible map exploits have also been completely fixed, and if more show, Gearbox has shown to address it as soon as possible. I don't think they'll go full retard like LoL and Riot has become, so while there are still some balance issues I feel like Gearbox is working on it alright enough.  As for the core gameplay itself, it's still as fun and enjoyable as it has always been, I myself love the Co-op/PvE and farming gear. PvP is equally enjoyable, and Gearbox is already adding three new maps for it very soon, along with still working on the DLC co-op missions and characters. It's unfortunate that because of 2K's lack of care to actually market the game, alongside Gearbox's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ PR that started the mostly incorrect comparisions to Overwatch, the game never drew a lot of players, and the launch problems and questionable decision-making (Adding a cash shop when less than a thousand people play, seriously?) meant a very small amount of us still enjoy the game for what it is.  I think Battleborn is still definitely worth your time, at least during the constant 50% off sales. It's a diamond in the rough for sure, and there's still enough people playing to enjoy everything, granted you play during peak hours. We could really enjoy having new players make the game more alive.",

The humor is decent, co-op is fun and for christ's sake some characters have 20 minutes of voicelines. However despite having a decent(?) pc, I suffer framerate issues and according to the internet this is actually a common problem. With that being said PVP is strange, the characters at least for me blend pretty badly into the background, and often you don't know what killed you (note this could be just to my framerate issues at times). Something I personally wish is that instead of more of a pvp focus, they would instead focus on more pve and maybe have some sort of mixture of co-op and pvp. Also probably the thousandth person to say this, you can't compare this to overwatch to be honest. Overall fun game, hope they release more pve content.",

There are some issues that the devs are working on, and the devs have stated that they plan to support this game for a long time.  The story is pretty good, but to be honest I really only played the story missions in order to get some of the characters unlocked sooner, and to get some gear initially. I find the PvP to be way better.   Currently they only have 3 modes of PvP, Control, Incursion, Meltdown.    Incursion is by far my favorite mode, it has two 'base' cores to destroy per team for winning, mercenary camps, and tons of team fighting. It is kind of weird how there is really only one lane, but it also keeps the action moving. A Lot of people have been stating that the first team to destroy the first 'base' wins through a snowball effect. I can say that I dont feel this is entirely true. I have had matches where we lost our first base, and then came back and destroyed both of the opposing teams bases. The major complaint has been that the shielding minions that spawn after the first base being destroys give the winning team to much advantage, and they have addressed it in a patch making them spawn less frequently.   Meltdown is a 2 lane mode where both sides try to feed their minions to grinders in the enemy teams territory. This is an interesting take that splits up the team fights to be more spaced out, but there are no mercenary camps. I play meltdown a lot less than incursion, since it requires more team communication due to the 2 lanes, but I still find it enjoyable MOBA fare.  Control is by far my least favorite mode, so much that I have played only one time on it. In this mode there is no minions, no mercenary camps, just 3 points on a map, and two teams fighting to control them. This mode feels nothing like a MOBA to me, and the one time I did play it, my team wouldn't work together and kept splitting up, while the other team just picked everyone off one by one until they had a HUGE level advantage.  I also have played overwatch, and I have to say both games play differently. If you want a MOBA first and shooter second play Battleborn, if you want a shooter with some moba elements tacked on as an afterthought, play Overwatch.",

Not to be confused with 'Overwatch', my least favourite game this year, Battleborn brings hilarity, diversity and difficulty to the table. OW may have some interesting characters and mechanics, however it makes me recall TF2 just a little too much.  Anyway, most of the game reminds me of Borderlands 2, as if it were written by Tiny Tina herself! Ashly Burch even voices a character in the game (Orendi... lol... she's awesome)!  The humour, the characters, the story and the epic voice lines and interactions with the characters and NPCs just makes me love it more!   To top it off, playing your characters to their maximum ranks gives you many ways to play all of the characters available. You unlock taunts, titles, skins, new augment mutations and even items unique to those characters! Everything you do directly affects who you're controlling. It's fantastic.  The Multiplayer portion of the game requires a little bit of polish, but it's still fun! Of course, it doesn't really stick to the 'Moba' aspect in Multiplayer maps, as heroes randomly leave lanes and steamroll everyone they come across. But whatever, it's more an FPS/FPM (first person melee) than it is a Moba. And it's still quite entertaining.  Now, the thing I find most intriguing is the fact that Gearbox will be releasing 5 NEW HEROES and story missions for the season pass, but they won't be necessary for the game. It's just additional content that you can choose or choose not to purchase. Your call. But the Season Pass sounds very worthwhile and I'm excited to see what the new heroes will be! My friends have two theories that have been discussed a couple of times. Will the new heroes be a 'One per Faction' addition? Or will they be an all-new Faction? I'm anxious to find out!  Anyway, let's go over the pros and cons:  ~PROS~ Tons of replayability. Multiple ways to play every hero. No Pay To Win (AT ALL! It's glorious...) Loadouts allow for diverse utility for multiple characters. Campaign can be played co-op up to 5 total players. Dialogue is friggin hilarious... Taunts are also hilarious... Every character has awesome abilities! Campaign is not easy, and Advanced mode is scary. Means I get to play harder! PVP can be quite entertaining. Graphics are flashy and fantastic. Augment system is soooooooo sweet! Ashly Burch voices a character akin to Tiny Tina, but bat @#$% insane. Hahaha!  ~CONS~ Multiplayer lacks modes and maps. Some characters are capable of trumping many in PVP. Campaign felt a little short. Sometimes melee characters can make you a little motionsick. Factions don't have their own campaign missions (would have helped to flesh out some additional story). Skins are just re-coloured. No actual 'epic' skins. Not a huge con, but kinda makes me sad...  Overall, Battleborn is more than worth it. Especially if you're planning on playing with a bunch of friends! Good for a laugh, plenty of replayability and enough to keep a completionist busy for a while, Battleborn is definitely a must buy!  Graphics: 9/10 (Flashy. Awesome. But may give someone a seizure... not recommended for people with epilepsy) Audio: 10/10 (I chalk this up to the dialogue, sound effects and in-game soundtrack. Great!) Story: 7/10 (The story is good, but I still think it needed some more length, and faction stories. But meh. Still good!) Controls: 9/10 (The controls are great. They're responsive and easy to use.) Replayability: 9/10 (TONS to do... and every mission has the potential to get a Gold rating. Completionism HOOOOO!) Overall: 9/10  Oscar Mike: SCRIPTS ARE FOR LOSERS!!!!!!

The single player mode is like dungeon raids from an MMO.   Positives  1. The roster is big, very big, in terms of how different the characters are, potential builds, team strategies and what gear to bring into battle.  2, Teamwork is required in every game, if not you will die.  3. The amount of unlockable content is amazing if you're into what it has to offer.   4, Extra DLC characters can be bought with in game currency.  5. The campaign missions are quite long, and there is 8 (13 with the season pass), that makes it worth it.  6. Devs have promised short term commitment to the game (Summer - Winter 2016) in terms of patches, more characters and community events.   Negatives,  1. The Capture the Flag modes are awful, and it just feels they were added to boost the amount of maps. I don't like dominaton but it is the closest to TDM you are going to get.  2. There is not enough maps for multiplayer (where the real replay value is). There is currently only 6, but they are adding 3 more (one for each mode)  3. The progression rate for unlocks is very slow, and the drop rate is overall low. it takes 40-50 hours to get enough gold to unlock any of the additional characters with in gaem currency 4. In game transactions were recently added for a currency to unlock better costumes  metics and other items. It's not game breaking but it feels cheap given the current game activity. 5. The community is currently quite small (&lt;1000 people active) at any one time for a game that game out a month ago. This shouldnt be as such a negative point as many people say. I've been a part of many PC shooters (Loadout, Gotham City Impostors, Cod:AW, even Bioshock 2 multiplayer that thrive with small communities)  6. In my short time with the game, there is a lot of well experienced players. Like any MOBA esque game, you can get toxic players if you do not play with your hero/champion correctly. I'd advise to play a few bot matches with heroes to learn how they play and learn the details of maps, because they can be quite confusing to beginners.  7. There is still some bugs that need to be patched.  8. It does take time to get into matches   To conclude (to both potential buyers and Gearbox), this game's success is going to be measured on the commitment of both the community and devs to stay with it. You need to approach this game like a MOBA, where each person has a role in each game mode. If you lack the required support/defence hero then you might lose a lot. Im talking from experience.",

If you are looking for evidence of Gearbox not understanding their audience, this is it. Like I mentioned, the characters are great, but there are many many things that are missing. Presumably from rushing the game out to beat Overwatch.  Missing: there are many characters that use stacks, things like 'kill an enemy, get a stack that = +30 health'. However, there is nowhere you can see these stacks or follow its progress. The balancing is atrocious between characters and maps, where Capture is not played at all, and the other 2 modes may as well have 1 map considering how often people vote for the same one.  Matchmaking itself can take upwards of half an hour for the most popular game modes. I am typing this right now out of boredom after waiting 20+ minutes for a game.  One last thing - They put the game on 40% off after a few weeks of the game being released, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on those who pre-purchased the game or bought it early. Also signalling that the game isn't doing well at all. And it isn't.  4/10. (Try overwatch, pretty much the same except they thought about balance, gamers and matchmaking)",

The 'Single player', if I can even call it that, is INCREDIBLY inflated, each mission taking upwards of 30 minutes of either escorting, capturing a point and defending it, or other boring gametype.   Here is the main issue of the single player: It depends on the story and characters to make the levels exciting and bearable, but when the story is about as boring as a piece of white bread, and the character are about as exciting as toilet water? Its just 30 minutes of killing the same ♥♥♥♥ over and over and over until you cant stand to see game again. I actually felt my brain melting out of my ears because it is just SO BLAND. Its just Borderlands with NONE of the character charm or 'loot', meaning you are marching through single player just to get an incredibly small amount of EXP for the character you are playing as and your 'rank', which unlocks more characters for single and multiplayer.

Better humor, more vibrant visuals, better leveling up in-game system, the overall gameplay is just more solid, and fluid. Cool full body cosmetics too with each hero having a large amount to unlock between the cosmetics, loadout bonuses, and mutation abilities.  In this game when you destroy something you collect 'shards.' Shards are the currency for the match.  You can have passive items in your loadout. But these arnt active at the start of the game. You have to choose between building things like turrents or stationary healers with shards- which in turn, this act grants you XP that will help push to level you up in that match. Or you use shards to help yourself and activate 1 out of the 3 items you can carry in your loadout. You can activate all three if you have enough. The cool feature about this choice is that you not only opt out on building things for your team to help win, but you dont gain any XP from choosing to activate your items.  Everytime you level up till you hit level 10 you get to choose on a DNA helix; Ability Skill A or Ability Skill B. But the more you play with a hero you get new abilities in the middle of the Helix called a Mutation: An Ability Skill C. So say I'm level 3. DNA Helix comes up. Instead of choosing left or right I can now choose a newly aquired skill in the middle. Which is a permanant 3rd option for that hero.   25 hero's can be at your disposal, all unique to the game. With a fun story that can be played in co-op. This game deserves more players than it has.   It's been awhile since I've had so much fun on a MOBA-esque game.  If you like, shooters, MOBA's, Swordfights, depth and strategy, or just the sound of 25 completely unique individuals including hero's that neither shoot guns or use swords and that sounds appealing to you with an exceptional amount of side challenges in game and per-hero to complete, achievements to collect, with tons of replayability, and a well executed reward system.

Matchmaking is taking longer, games are more unbalanced, and finding a full party for story mode seems to be a rarity at least for me. And with Overwatch coming out next week, I feel like this game's population is going to fall even more. I really have almost no complaints with the gameplay itself, it's a well done shooter/MOBA hybrid with a fun, if short, story mode, lots to unlock and complete, content is not an issue.

The matchmaking is not only unbalanced, you can only get into a game during certain times of the day. I'm writing this review while I'm waiting to join a game. I've been waiting about 30 minutes on a Monday at 4 pm EST. I tried this morning, around 8am, waited for players for an hour and finally gave up. Yesterday, Sunday, was decent during the day until around 8/9pm then it all went downhill.   On the unbalanced issue of matchmaking, since more people have leveled up it is not the issue it was initially when there were only a few high xp players.

Overall, Battleborn is a pretty fun game, especially for the on-sale price tag that was offered. However, at full-price, Battleborn offers only 8 story mode maps (with repititive/unimaginative gameplay mechanics) and 3 PvP modes. While the game has fantastic character and charm, it lacks in support from Gearbox developers, and certainly does not need to be charging $5.00 for additional content; any content offered in the season pass or through DLC should have been included in the original box-price.  PvP is just not supported fully, at all, especially for a game that was marketed almost exclusively as a PvP title with a PvE side-story. There is no ranked matchmaking system, meaning you get pitted against players much more skilled or much less skilled than yourself, and rarely see a truly balanced and fun match. Additionally, there is no pre-made queue, spectator mode, or practice mode (bots are a total joke that get stuck on geometry constantly), which are staples for a MOBA style game wishing to compete in an already competitive market.  I love Gearbox and all their work, but Battleborn is not worth it at a $60.00 (or $75) price tag. Buy this game on sale if you want a funny PvE mission with comedic charm, but do not invest if you\\'re interested in the PvP aspect until they improve matchmaking and properly support a competitive crowd. Aimbotting and lag switching are also rampant, and combined with no report feature, cheating continutes to go unpunished.",

Now, after release the 'major' competition is out. Overwatch  or Battleborn. the sameness of cell shading...  Let's look at it like this. Has blizz ever done cell shading before? Answer is NO But Valve has, in a little legendary game known as Team Fortress 2 which... lo and behold is a Class Based Shooter. Has Gearbox done cell shading before?? Yes! In every single Borderlands game.  Now, before I talk about Battleborn in particular, let me get one thing out of the way. I have been playing Blizzard titles since 1998. I've played them all. I was a huge fan before being a blizz fan was a 'thing' , really. and I have not touched Overwatch... What does that say, in and of itself? Nothing, well.... Onwards to  BATTLEBORN: Okay, at first I thought the game looked stupid. I mean, Oscar Mike is an imbecile. and using him for the primary trailer was a travesty. Later on, I did my research. OH! Its not an Overwatch clone. It is a FPS MOBA (made by a team who has produced some GREAT FPS games.  The thing is. This game has depth. Its offering a lot of additional free content over time. -as in any traditional MOBA you level up your chosen Hero throughout a match, levelling them up outside of the match gives access to 'mutations' in their DNA (the lvling up is akin to genetic code)  Gear: You unlock gear, mostly through loot packs bought with currency earned from matches. Unlike MANY games in this position the gear is not single use. -and you can have multiple gear loadouts.  of course there are skins for the Battleborn. There are 25 Battleborn to begin with, with 5 more to come. free updates adding new matches as well (and the additional playable characters are only available initially  for season pass owners... You can unlock them just by playing.  Shift codes can be a pain, but heck. free intermittant loot!  ----  all this, and I bet you're wondering... is it fun?!  Heck Yea its fun! Most fun I've had in a MOBA Most fun I've had in an FPS in years. all in all a fluid meshing of two major genres.  Gameplay consists of either playing campaign missions, solo or cooperatively Or in 5v5 matches where there are currently 3 match types.  Running around, collecting crystal shards (used to power up buildable defenses and boosts, or merely to activate your equipped gear....  Now, I only have 8-9 hours atm, but I am a father of a 3 year old. Even one (30 minute)  match is a lot to ask for someone who's priorities are elsewhere these days.  ALL IN ALL  don't listen to the haters. Don't listen to the adolescant drones who are so far up Overwatch's behind they can't see straight enough to recognize the title that works harder for its pricetag than its competition.  Give it a shot, Gearbox deserves it. Deserves your dollar more than the monstrosity that Blizzard has become.",

The hype that overwacth has is sprouted from the characters having great 'assets' (butts) This is a disgrace to me and should be too to Gearbox. if making a game popular with the public takes making the characters hot and attractive, then what kind of world would we live in where we practically play porn games because of its popularity?

Multiple times I have been running from a melee hero as a ranged hero, if I hit a wall, there is limited sliding and the second the melee hero touches me, I am pinned and slashed to death. Intentional or not, it makes for a very hopeless feeling during the encounter. (I guess you could attribute this to me not being very good at the game yet as well.)

            "review_text": "After much anticipation, Blizzard's new first person DOTA has come out: Overwatch. It's pretty good.  There are a little less than two dozen heroes for you to choose from, each having a unique, specific weapon as well as a passive and 2 active abilities. Each also has an ultimate ability with a long cooldown that you unlock and level 5. Yes, that's right, there are levels, and each time you level you can splice your DNA to gain one of two benefits for the rest of the game, and if you play a character enough times, you unlock some third choices on that path as well. For instance, one choice might increase your accuracy and reload, while another would increase your base damage.  Heroes are unlocked through a number of means. The easiest way to unlock most of them is to accomplish specific challenges, like winning 5 games with a hero from 1 faction (like, say, The Horde). If you're not in a rush though, you can also unlock all the heroes by just ranking up enough.  A cool twist on the genre is that you can enter a match with a loadout of three pieces of gear, and you spend points during the match to activate those pieces of gear, so you have to anticipate what you'll need in that match, but you're not bound to buying those things in a specific order. Personally, my favorite loadout is 2 Arcanite Reapers, and a hat made out of 3 hats. Which brings me to another point: there's no crafting, which is cool. Blizzard usually overdoes it on crafting, even in their card games.  Overwatch has both a competitive mode and a co-op mode. The competitive mode is a lot like what you expect, but I'm mostly interested in the co-op. Sometimes you just want to blow things up with some friends, right? In co-op, the game is a lot like what you'd expect from a cooperative FPS, kind of like if Starcraft: Ghost let you play with other people. You go through a level doing TF2-like objectives. Escort the thing, defend the thing, or blow up the things.  The characters are varied, and everyone should be able to find something that suits their style. On the other hand, some characters are better for PvE or PvP, which means the full roster won't see equal play. For instance, the robot sniper, the cowboy, and turret are really good.  People are acting like the game is some new great cultural phenomenon, but it's really not, it's just a pretty good game. I guess if you're the kind of person who puts 2000 hours into the same competitive shooter it might be a godsend, but if you're not that dedicated to single games, but you like FPSes, it's probably worth picking up on sale.",

The devs put  0 love  into this game. The skins are the  worst recolors  one could ever imagine. Most look identical because they just darkened or brightened the colors. Other recolors just look as if they gone over them blindfolded with the  Bucket-Tool  in Paint (actually not an exaggeration). Looking back at them, I realize how bad they actually are. Gearbox could learn a thing or two from Blizzard, who actually create really good-looking and creative skins.  But wait(!), they recently released some skins you need to  pay real money  for. They definitely look better than those recolors but why does on need to pay for content in a P2P game? Overwatch let's you buy special skins with ingame credits.  Checked the news today and saw that  they are considering to switch to F2P  after what?  1/4 year?  F*** our customers, at least we got their money! And know what? Let's  not  give them a refund in form of in-game credits as other games have done when they went F2P (e.g. Evolve). We need to be remembered as the  most greedy and incompetent studio  out there.  Till this day I  regret  buying Battleborn and supporting this crooked studio. I will never ever in my life buy a game from Gearbox anymore if they haven't been carefully reviewed.  ",

Either one is cheaper (Smite is free, or $30 for every single character ever - including future ones, overwatch is $40).  For co-op... Eh. You could do worse. You can absolutely do better for less.  It's quite easy to get bored of the repetitive gameplay, particularly in the co-op mode. Battleborn? More like battleBORED. Ha. Hilarious. In all seriousness, pick it up at a steep discount or expect to be disappointed. I fully expect F2P at some future date, just not anytime soon (they've already got the cash shop, just gotta lock all but the most basic heroes behind a pay/grind wall and-oh wait they did that already too).",

            "review_text": "The game is excellent for what it is. A FPS MOBA (with a campaign mode) thrown in for added sugar. I have seen a lot of remarks regarding the 'restriction' of playable characters, loot, and lore when starting the game for the first time.   When you start the game you are given a handful of characters. Play the campaign for a few hours on normal difficulty and you will have atleast half of them unlocked, along with the lore for whichever character/s tickles your fancy the most. That being said, some of the lore quests can be slightly tedious or difficult given their specific tasks.   Loot/loot packs are not all that difficult to obtain either, and while i will agree that it can give people a moderate hand up in pvp. I also do not think it is a hinderance or severe handicap if you dont have 'legendary' gear. Like many other MOBAs all characters have their own strengths, as well as weaknesses to other characters. Right now the only character i feel could be considered OP in comparison to others would be Alani. For someone put in as a 'support' class, her dps can be on par if not higher than quite a few of the assault characters in both PVE and PVP, and given her 'skill trees' you can easily mix and match her for both high dps and moderate healing at the same time.  The biggest and only real 'complaint' i have about the game currently, is the overwhelming lack of other players. When i bought the game at release, it only took 30 secs to 1 min tops to get into a group, for both pvp/pve modes. Now, even at peak hours, i can sometimes wait 20mins before only getting one or two team members for campaign mode, only for them to disconnect halfway through a map because we wiped once and 'theres just no point in pushing forward without a full group.' PVP wait times are ridiculous save for Incursion, but...if higher level players dont feel like 'dealing with nubz' they will happily d/c only to have your wait time start all over again.   In short, the game is good but not great, in most part due to lack of player base. Maybe steam will throw it on their upcoming sale and breath some life back into it.",

A MOBA-shooter with 25 vastly different and uniquely designed characters, each with their own interesting lore behind them on top of the universe lore, which is particularly interesting as well. Yes, it's a Gearbox game. It's going to have silly writing, it's gonna have very a cartoony, sorta cel-shaded art style, and it's gonna be a shooter. But to take it in this MOBA direction like they did? You gotta have respect for them making a game like this. The balance, like with all PvP games at release, is not perfect to a T with some big-♥♥♥ cherries on top and rainbow sprinkles. It's clear that they did put a lot of work into this game, and if it did well, they were gonna make sure to support for the next couple years like a proper MOBA (because this is still a business, and they still need to make a buck). But with these Overwatch clone accusations (as someone who has played several dozen hours of both, I can say they are not even close to each other and both great in their own ways) and BS balance complaints running rampant, it makes me feel a bit depressed that this plan might not ever see the light of day. You can call it whatever you want, that's your opinion, but if you accuse it of being something it's not, or if you smack it in the face like you would a 2 month old baby for crying, then you're just wrong.  Rant over. It's a good game and a good new IP, if you like Gearbox, if you like shooters, if you like MOBAs, take a good look at this kickass asskicker of a game.",

Pros- Lots of different heroes that all play differently.  Lots of customization, between skins (tier 2/3 skins incoming yay), gear, taunts, ect.  Lots of content. There are 8 missions that have 4 difficulties that can be played solo or upto 5 coop. Lore challenges to unlock legendary gear for that hero, ect. Lots of titles, taunts. There are 100 levels and all 25 heroes can goto level 15, that's alot of levels.  Games looks great. The cartoony style is what GB is known for. The humor fits well and heros interact differently with each other during play.  PVP matches can be intense and satisfying but like all games communication and teamwork is key.  Now there are cons as well.  They use an Elo-system for matchmaking but it's broken atm. There is no way a rank 1 is equal to a rank 28 because it only takes 1-2 matches to even rack rank 2. There is a fix incoming though.  There are balancing issues. Happens in every game of this type. They are listening to feedback and making changes accordingly.  There are report of performance issues, especially with AMD. I have no issues so I can't comment too much about this but letting you know anyway.  So that's it short and sweet.  I recommend you watch videos and do some searching if you are on the fence. These types of games are hit and miss with alot of players and going in blind is silly. Watch youtube/twitch and get a feel for the game by watching.  There are more heroes, modes, skins, maps, taunts, probably gear, all coming and it's all free. The only thing being charged for is story missions that are $5 each.  There ya have it. Hope to see you in game.",

            "review_text": "Battleborn is a good game released at a bad time. It released at a time with a fluid of first person MOBA's came out the biggest Overwatch. The week of Battleborn's launch was the week of Overwatch's Beta which had over 9,7 million users playing. The internet was already raving about Overwatch due to Blizzards marketing even before the beta, after the beta forums and blogs were just completely overwatch. Pushing Battleborn under the rug, the only people really fallowing it devotedly was fans of other of the makers games such as borderlands. But lets focus on the game itself now...  Battleborn fallowed in the same footsteps as borderlands with its cartoony art style (which I like very much) over the top action and sense of humor. The characters were over-all delightful but lack any real depth to them. You don't really build any type of feeling or relationship with them, so there's no connection. As such you never fully feel immersed in the world, which is a real downer. They focus heavy on the multiplayer aspect of the game which frankly I found to be the least fun part of it. They only have a few levels with 3 or so modes, switch characters is the only way to make it feel fresh but even that gets old after awhile. The real fun of Battleborn was in its co-op story mode which unfortunately is also lacking. There are only about 7 missions (although I'm sure more will come via DLC but lets focus on the main game itself) and you'll find yourself protecting and guarding things very often. The best parts are in between those areas, and the boss fights. They also have different difficulties to keep things fresh, and the reply value is high. Trying different team set ups, and making your way through missions together you grow a bond between players much more than you get with online mode where 1 out of 3 teams you join will just try to get kills and ignore the goal. Its due to the co-op story mode that I recommend this game, its charming, silly and has a very uqinge story to it, the only down side is the lack of a story mode when this was the best part of the game.   Pros: • Co-op Story Mode • Fun and entertaining Characters • High Reply Value • Good for both the Causal gamer and more hardcore one • One of the best Intros/ending cut-scenes seen in a game • Lots of dialogue, it even changes sometimes when replying a level or playing as a different character keeping things fresh • Interesting Level Up system, really makes you able to custom a character to your play style • Lots of Loot to go through • Lots of achievements to get for each character  • Unlockables   Cons • Lacking in Story Mode length • Lacking in Multiplayer options • Lacking in depth/background story/character development for its 'Battleborns' • Even once you do everything your felt wanting and not in a good way  In short:  Its a good game. Its not great, it wont blow you away but its solid and plays good,and fun. Its worth getting but I'd wait into the price drops or it goes on sale.   UPDATE: This game is now free to play. Although it has NO PLAYER base, it takes forever to find a game. Its a dead game.",

I played during a beta for this game, with only one brief story mission, and the game ran well, and looked fantastic. The story was very interesting and I was really looking forward to it.  Unfortunately, my excitement from getting this game cheap, ($15 in the bundle with a bunch of other games instead of $60) was subsided by performance issues.  The game is heavily stylized, and while it was made with Nvidia, like the Borderlands titles, the consensus seems to be that Gearbox has either ignored, or has not chosen/implemented a fix/patch for AMD optimization. That being said, the game does look great at 720p and on everything turned off, or on low. The effects are really neat and I definitely enjoyed the anime-style cutscenes, it's very refreshing compared to CGI-everything.  The game looks great, and so far the characters are very well fleshed out and have their own universe about them, and the style is great. However, with the performance issues (on AMD-hardware systems, and possibly some Nvidia/Intel systems) I would recommend writing to Gearbox about fixing some performance issues before balancing out character performance and meta-tweaks.  Gearbox has done some great stuff in the past, and definitely care for their writing and attention to detail, but we definitely need to not ignore this issue.",

Two to six months from now, this game will either be dead from lack of players and/or not being Overwatch, or barely surviving because Gearbox came to their senses and made it free to play. Either way, you're better off waiting. It's not a bad game, but it's not a particularly good game either. The character designs range from interesting to idiotic, but all of them are utterly uninspired in terms of functionality, the combat is flat and two dimensional compared to any game with a decent map designer, and it needs *at least* four times as many multiplayer maps as it has currently to even reach the minimum variety requirements of a shooter. Are you the parent of someone who worked on Battleborn? If the answer is no, then I promise you, there is nothing here you need to rush to see.  The Hero Shooter/MOBA Shooter is going to be a wildly oversaturated genre by the end of 2016, and Battleborn is not going to be one of the winners of the inevitable battle royale that will ensue. Not with a $60 price tag, and not in anything like its current state.  *** If you find this review short, or less than comprehensive, it's because of my continuing efforts to refine game reviews for the modern era. As gamers, we need to move forward. Imagine if every time a movie critic reviewed a romantic comedy, they started by explaining what a romantic comedy was in the first place. It would be both moronic and excruciating. Yet, that's exactly how most video game reviews are still written.  My goal is to only tell you the things you might not know already, or to offer a perspective you might not have considered. In a world saturated with screenshots and let's play videos you don't need me, or anyone else, to explain Battleborn (or any game) from the ground up. No more than you need someone to explain what a science fiction movie is before you watch Star Wars.",

Pros:  Fully fleshed-out, storied campaign that can be played singleplayer with no need to friendly Ai bots. Hilarious dialogue, especially from characters like ISIC. Varied characters and gameplay. It's damn pretty. Multiplayer has perfect netcode and plays really well with 3 different modes that have all been well thought out. It's sort-of like a MOBA in one mode, like TF2 in another and something completely new in the third. Even as someone who has never enjoyed MOBA's despite really trying to, I really enjoy the multiplayer. Lore and Cosmetic unlocks. Well balanced characters.  Cons: Could really use some more multiplayer maps. Matchmaking can sometimes be slow to connect. No punishment for players who quit multiplayer versus games early. ",

I also feel disappointed that people disparage it for not being a sequel to Borderlands, which shouldn't be held against it. Above anything else, Battleborn is it's own game. Now, the question is, is that game good? No, no it isn't.  For single player - There are only a handful of missions which become very, very repetitive. Many of the characters will come into your roster without much fanfare with only a couple actually having any tangible import to the story (Boldur and Caldarius are introduced through missions but everyone else is just kind of dropped in). Missions mainly devolve into guarding an objective while wave after wave of enemies is thrown at you which gets quite boring after a time. Also, with the voting system for missions players will often just drop games if the missions they want to play isn't chosen.  For multiplayer - I could go on and on so I'm going to list everything below so to try and stay organized:  1. Movement is a chore - your teammates collide with you which makes for some very tedious and frustrating moments of trying to move but you end up jostling with your teammates rather than go anywhere. Playing the 3 story tall Montana will enrage you to no end as you run in place wondering what the hell is going on only to find one of your tiny teammates is stuck under your feet (and I'm sure they aren't having a great time either).  2. Along the same lines of the collision issues if you're a ranged character you'll be very annoyed that your teammates can block your shots. This becomes infuriating as you shoot at a low health adversary just to have them escape because your teammate absorbed most of the bullets you sent their way.  3. Class imbalance - Certain characters are really too powerful for how easy they are to play. Rath is incredibly frustrating has he has a very powerful melee attack combo that requires him to do nothing but hold down the attack button. The problem with this is that he doesn't need to even aim his attacks, he only needs to be in your general area to do damage. He also moves very quick even while attacking making him incredibly tough to hit. To put the cherry on top of this sad sundae his ultimate attack is disgustingly powerful, allowing him to slough off your health while filling his own at the same time. This is just one character - Galilea is even worse at times with her own 360 degree attack combo, shield block, AoE and health steal. And watch as you get stun locked constantly by Shayne over and over and over.  4. Melee stuns. I hope you like not being able to play your character because between Attikus, and Rath you'll be in the air so much you'll think you had wings (or at least had them so you could fly out of the match and the very game itself). Shayne is also an annoying stun-lock type character that can be very frustrating to play against (although he doesn't knock you up in the air, so there's that).  5. Uneven leveling - I mainly played the capture game type which revolves around capturing and holding territories (the same game type in most FPS games). The more territories you have the more points you get each second. First team to 1,000 points wins. This game type doesn't have near enough things to do for experience and usually ended in a one-sided stomp fest (sometimes in my favor, most of the time against). There are shards and turrets but doing the 'buildables' gives so little experience and aid in the form of damage or health that they were rarely ever worth it. Because of this players receive massive chunks of experience for kills, which leads to early snowballing. With things as they are it's very hostile for new players as they run around struggling to find ways to make their character stronger only to end up getting crushed under the boot of an enemy who was the fortunate recipient of a few early games kills.  6. Terrible new player experience - The game doesn't make much of an effort to help the player understand the game mechanics. If you search online you'll find all kinds of people asking questions regarding how to level, which is a basic mechanic in the game. Unfortunately the most common answer to this question is 'kill minions and build turrets' which is unfortunate as many people will take this advice and still be unable to get any meaningful levels in a match as too much experience is weighted on player kills.  7. Snowballing - Snowball is the term used when a team or character just gets better and better (usually from getting fed easy kills) to the point where it is very difficult (if not impossible) to stop them. Much like a snowball rolling down a hill getting bigger and bigger. Snowballing is a massive problem, probably one of the biggest in this game. Due to the extremely large chunks of experience players get for kills, a few early game kills can send a player or team rolling down the hill extremely quickly. I would say roughly over half of the games I have played were decided in the first 2½ minutes of the game due to how much weight is placed on those early kills. Once these kills are made, and players level up quickly from them, it becomes next to impossible to do anything to stop them and the game quickly becomes a 10 minute snooze-fest as you wait around for it to just end (if you have teammates that refuse to surrender to inevitable loss).  8. Long Wait Times - The game hasn't reached high popularity. Some of that is deserved (as it's not very good), some of it isn't (unfair comparisons to Overwatch isn't doing it any favors). This can lead to long wait times for matches and running into several people over and over again which isn't too big of an issue unless those players are toxic (which happens often enough - this is a MOBA after all).  9. Poor Matchmaking - Do a quick search for 'Battleborn Matchmaking' and you'll find no shortage of people upset over the horrendous matchmaking. Newer people to the game are being matched against far more experienced players. Almost worse is random pick-up groups are being matched against parties of people. This is breaking a basic tenant of matchmaking, which is random solo queue folks should be matched against other solo queue people and players in groups should be playing against other players in groups.This helps to keep everything even so the players who aren't in a practiced group won't get steamrolled by those players who are. Consequently the players in the practiced group will get much more of a challenge by playing other grouped teams.  10. Particle Blindness - The game looks pretty, there's no doubt about that however this comes at a price. They cranked up the particle effects on the game and it can get pretty ridiculous in fights as you lose sight of everyone and everything around you. It's like every fight is the finale at the end of a fireworks show. The crazy effects definitely could have been toned down and the game would have been better off for it.  Overall I was really excited for this game ever since I heard it was in the making and after finally playing it it's been nothing but a disappointment. As of the writing",

            "review_text": "Oozing with style, Battleborn mixes several well established genres into a moshpit of humor, gunplay, and first-person melee. And, it gets most of it right.  Battleborn is trying to be so many things, it's a wonder that it succeeds at enough to make it hold together. Witty, funny dialogue for a cast of zany and unique characters helps polish the whole deal, but the gameplay is what shines through.   Slicing, dicing, and punching feels as satisfying as the gunplay (something the makers of Borderlands know a bit about), and somehow works in the pvp multiplay, and not just in the co-op campaign.  Colorful, cartoon styled graphics steal the show with bright and vivid scenes that leap out of the screen.  Every fight is littered with witty one-liners and quips from loveable characters.  Now, for all this, the game does suffer from a touch of an identity crisis as it tries to fulfill your every desire.  You get a bit of a story-driven campaign that will leave you wanting more.  You get a few moba-style incursion maps.  You get a touch of capture-the-point  You get some tug-of-war robot battles.  All of these are playable solo (with bots in most cases), or online (though you will need to have an internet connection to run the game).   There is another issue: the online community can be difficult to get involved with in the most popular (I believe) game mode, Incursion. It's easy to get trolled, or get owned.  Finally, Battleborn can be a bit of a performance hog at times.  I fully recommend the purchase with the above in mind. This is a game that happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. It is worthy of adoring fans and worth being laughed at, immersed in, and enjoyed.  While not palatable at 60$ (I took advantage of the humble bundle), it is a good game.",

Some are SO similar that I am surprised that lawyers from Activision Blizzard haven't knocked on the Texas offices.  The campaign is however simply not up to Borderlands 2 standards. The art style has gone away from BL2 and moved into Blizzard's land of westernisedanime. The game for the most part is fun, but its nothing to write home about.   Having played Overwatch I'd say that Blizzards game is far, far, far better than Battleborn - save your money and spend it on that title if you are after a 'Hero Shooter' Moba hybrid.  Dare I say it, that 'RP' has done it again, oversold, under-delivered and underwhelmed. Buyers beware of ANYTHING that Gearbox produce - never believe the hype. Don't pre-order, wait for the reviews and expect disappointment. So far only the Homeworld games have redeemed any of Gearboxes prestige since ACM, and lets face it.. they didn't code the engine on that one.. it was based on Relic's incredible work.

When you first get the game you only have a few of the heros unlocked and have to get your account level up higher to unlock all of the other heros. The problem with this is that these heros are completely unbalanced, which makes the higher level players be able to dominate each match while the newer players that havent unlocked these heros to do nothing but die all game.   Another problem is that while the heros for this game each have a large amount of lore and unique abilities to it, the maps have suffered from a lack of attention. In the competitive mode there is a total of 6 maps that you can play on. This would not be a problem if the maps were designed extremely well and had an entire set of stratigic spots you have to learn to utilize, but sadly its just a map that is identical on both teams sides. This leads the game to become extremely repetitive after only a short amount of time and leaving you to only care about the progression of your heros that are destined to either stomp the enemy team or die nonstop due to lack of balancing.  This game was great in concept, but has a lot of problems in it that lead to an unenjoyable experience. This game may still have hope as developers balance the heros and add more maps to the game, however at this time they are charging $60 for a game that still belongs in beta.",

First of all I dont really care about the single player but what i played of it i really didnt enjoy. It was really boring wave based shooting gallery nonsense.  Multiplayer is better but it feels like you have to force yourself to keep playing its not very addictive its good but it feels more like a chore to play. Its good but kind of boring and repetitive.   I am not good enough at the game to really comment on the balance but it does seem unbalanced to me. For example you can be using a character and shoot other character so many times but they dont go down and then they see you and can kill you in 3-5 seconds even though you have been constantly shooting them for 30 seconds or more and even hitting them with you super and all your abilities. Like i say im not good enough to really comment but thats my impression and probably will be the impression of a lot of people who are not hardcore into this game  I was on the fence as to whether this was a positive or negative review but what made my mind up was that as far as i know there are only 6 maps. And you cannot even play all 6 maps in your favourite mode. There are 3 modes with 2 maps per mode. This is a full price multiplayer game with 2 maps per mode. The game is quite boring and repetitive as is. But to be looking at the same two maps over and over if you play one mode is just ridiculous rip off in my opinion.  Positive Graphics are nice Multiplayer Gameplay is ok Lots of characters  Negative Single player is awful Multiplayer while ok is quite repetitive and boring Almost no maps make it even more boring and repetitive Game feels unbalanced between characters though i may be wrong on that one Feels more like a chore to play one more game than a compulsion Matchmaking seems not great most game we have either destroyed enemy team or they destroyed us and matchmaking can take a while and doesnt seem to be persistent lobbies so you have to que up again every time (at least i think so) Toxic community  Also the game has got a lot of criticism so there are a lot of fanboy abusive white nights trying to defend the game so nobody is allowed to criticise.  I wanted to like this game and i will keep trying it for a while. If my view changes i will update this but for me its not worth it. Game should have been free to play or maximum 15 dollars. I would advise to stay away. Also this game is likely to die out soon so I would recommend to avoid it.",

However, after I played the actual game for few hours, I lost all my interests and did not see most thing I experienced in trailer.   First, I did not experience the excitment of shooting. Magazine size of most characters is pathetic. Map is pretty huge but the machanics of guns or bows make low accuracy and make quick kill very difficult. During high level character battle, it is very easy to get into non-kill long time confrontation. I played CS over 500 hrs and Randow6 over 200 hrs. It is very important that a shooting game gives player great feeling of kill and push. Battleborn didn't make me excited at all.  Secondly, the co-op mode is very repetitive and boring. Some minion monsters can cost u more than 3 magazine to kill, I jusy simply shoot and run over and over again. Even for boss fight, the skill and team work is so little that I didn't feel any sense of accompliment after finishing the boss.   Third, the skill system is poor. It just never makes u feel skills are important. Some characters have very strong skills, but for most skills, they didn't blend into the game. Short example, I always forgot to use my skill, cuz they never make me feel them necessary.   Fourth, the game is lack of skill. Yes, u need some skills to move and shoot, but this game doesn't make players developing their very Battleborn skills. CS needs players to have skills in recoil control, map tactics and even financial management. RanbowSix needs player to co-op their characters' skill and camp smart. I did'nt see any Battleborn skill. Melee heros just stick to crowd and throw all the skills. Range heros just constantly shoot and run. Most maps are one-direction. U can't really camp or really play smart.   Very simple conclusion, this game makes me feel playing with bots in multiplayer. I also didn't feel the excitment of quick kill or any fast pace thing in this game(except u can run very fast). The co-op is like zombie mode with all zombies replaced by Roshan.",

The characters vary from angular, cute, scarey, annoying, weird, beefy, colorful, badass, and so on. There are so many things going on with the characters, that it makes me wish it were a 3rd person game instead of a 1st person one. Characters like Kelvin, and Rath have parts of them that get in the way in the first person view making the game annoying to play at times. Unlike what many people have said, I find the campaign to be incredibly fun WITH other people, and I didn't find it to be that repetitive. Soloing the campaign is a different story though. Like many multiplayer games right now, the match making is GARBAGE. There is a very high chance of getting 2 teams with one team having much higher levels, if not a premade team. After playing online vs modes, I am left with so many of the negative feelings that I get when I play any moba. Either I am not hardcore Esports enough, or the game has so many moba-like balance problems. As of right now, the game frustrates the living crap out of me when I play vs. The problems of the game may be fixed later though. I'll probably keep playing this game, but I don't think I can recommend it to anyone unless you have a big pool of people to play it with.  100+ hours in and a few months later, I still feel the same way =).",

I got this for $15 IN a humble bundle so I'd say it was pretty well worth the maybe only $5 I spent on each game. For $60 this isn't a polished game. The F.O.V. is locked at 100 when some characters should have it higher since there weapons take up half the screen and you are unable to see where you are shooting or meleeing. For $60, buy Overwatch instead, while they are very different games, you aren't missing much with this except more microtransactions, DLC characters and somewhat boring characters. If you can find it on sale for real cheap, I'd say go ahead, but for what they are asking for and how very few of the characters are unlocked from the start, I'd give this a hard pass.  *Edit* I'd also like to add that the matchmaking is pretty broken, tried playing one of the gamemodes other than campaign, I've never seen how horribly unbalanced the teams are with 5 level 100's on one side and level 4's and 5's on the other. There is also no backfills so if someone leaves during your match and the game decides not to cancel it, I'll just say GOOD ♥♥♥♥ING LUCK. Go ahead are say 'well, Blizzard's matchmaking sucks,' I'll agree with you if you're talking about competitive, but in quick play, at least they match you with the same or at least within 10 levels around you (of course unless someone is grouped)",

The combat as action-packed and hectic, the characters are all recognizeable and memorable, the constant Borderlands-style humor of the game keeps the game from feeling too serious and competitive. Afterall, it's kind of hard to stay hyper-focused and dead serious when you're playing as a bad-mouthed anrthopomorphic cowboy bird armed with a rocket launcher. The story mode is a nice touch and works to give context to everything going on in the game world as well as give players who aren't really in to PvP something to do. The huge amount of challenges and constant unlockables gives you the sense that you are actually accomplishing something no matter how bad your match is going for you, and also keeps tons of goals for players to work towards, which is something that a lot of games should be doing.   All in all, Battleborn is a wacky, cartoonish team shooter that works off one simple concept: games are supposed to be fun and memorable.  I'd highly recommend it to anybody who enjoys first person shooters, as well as anybody who enjoys MOBAs.",

If you like the game then play it and stop complaining because things will eventually get patched/fixed (The game is STILL NEW). Battleborn is a lot of fun and GB is trying to do something different and honestly its a nice for once to see a company go a different route. That is why I enjoy the game so much. I can't remember the last time I really did enjoy a new game that recently came out. It really is different.  Those that are complaining about the possible addition to microtransactions. Get over yourself. Do people not REALLY understand how much it can cost to keep servers up and running for people to play on? It is already known that todays games should be selling for much more than $60 just so that a company can make their money back from developement. And yet people are complaining about GB adding in cosmetics and MAYBE (YES MAYBE) xp/credit boosters.  SO WHAT IF THEY DO? That'll make you stop playing a game you actually enjoy (Yep, you're ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ if you are one of those people)? If someone works 5 days a week, has a husband/wife/kids, and only have like one day a week to play then let them enjoy the booster and get caught up with everyone else that can play everyday. IS THAT REALLY AN ISSUE FOR YOU?! 'Oh, but then they'll get to level up other battleborns faster than me, buy more loot packs, and I already paid $60 for the game!' Then buy a booster yourself. AND you enjoy the game then why WOULDNT you want GB to continue developement? Why wouldnt you want to make sure the servers stay up and dont go down due to the lack of funding? People really like to shoot themselves in the foot.  The GAME is a lot of fun to play. The CO-OP is awesome and can be definitely challenging and at times frustrating if people don't know what they are doing but this game is still NEW so people will need to figure everything out. Also, I don't sit around waiting forever to get into a game. If people are playing from other countries then thats a problem over there but not here in the US. To claim so otherwise I'd call them a liar.  The PVP is refreshing and I think some of the issues is that people expect to just buy the game and jump into PvP/Advanced CO-OP and 'OMG BE AMAZING.' I find it funny when they cant do anything or get mad because they keep dying while trying to read their skills WHILE INSIDE a PvP or CO-OP match and they rage quit. I keep coming across this over and over.  Tonight would be a good example. We had someone who JUST bought the game and go straight into advanced heliophage after completeing the beginning story. They didnt even bother to read their abilities or anything and they were already complaining about it being too 'hard.'  Lastly, this game ISNT Overwatch and was NEVER trying to be Overwatch so people need to STOP COMPARING it to Overwatch. Yes, I own both. They are 100% different.  IF YOU ENJOY THE GAME THEN PLAY IT AND HELP GB MAKE IT BETTER! The game was just RELEASED ON May 3rd! Damn, people give it time to continue to develope. You know, programers, developers, they need to get paid too and have lives just like the rest of us.",

Pros: 1. its really fun gameplay, very casual at 1st aproach and becomes deeper as you dig through mechanics (as almost any MOBA game) 2. I like style and graphics 3. Borderlandish humor :D its somewhat silly..ish, yet really fun 4. The world and setting. We'll speak about it later. 5. Voice acting 6. Coop and versus modes. 7. character diversity  Cons: 1. you wont believe, but amount of action happening on the screen is overwhelming. I cant play more then one coop mission or one pvp battle, bcos my eyes cant sustain that amount of cartoonish FX for long time. 2. Skins... they are awfull. Stock coloring for each character is way better. Why would anyone call that ♥♥♥♥ a skin? 3. Same toonish intro for every coop mission. Its cool for the 1st time you see it, but why we cant have some story-telling toons between missions? 4. some displacement skills have problems interacting with environment, so if u have any dashing, sliding etc abilities, you have to check twice the terrain around. 5. story-telling  Personally i like the Battleborn universe, i rly enjoy gameplay and style. Yet alot of stuff in game requires rework. The Solus sytem is magic, adn the background is awesome! (its the last Star in the uniwerse!! and its up to us, players, to protect it) however such background requires a proper storytelling, and game lacks it. We have sick into toon, but we just see some cut-scenes from it before each coop mission. (i got the idea, to make a stylish intro, like every toon TV series had, but it doesent look like that) Huge problem is abilities FX. Once more then 3-4 characters start use some of them, u cant read the battleground anymore. All that toonish-FX just melt in front of you into totall grungy mess, so its hard to tell what exactly is active and on cooldown, and what is left.  I cant rate game with one score. So i'll separate them: Gameplay 9.5/10 (its so charming and fun) Visuals 5/10 (graphics is awesome, but FX mess hurts my eyes) Story 5/10 (might change, as soon as i play more story mode) Sounds 8.5 (its good really) Service 1.0 (such a fail)",

I was one who fell head over heels for Overwatch, and like many people looked at this game as an inferior and too similar of game. I kept putting it off, but I finally found it on sale and decided to pick it up and give it a go. Granted, I haven't thrown a lot of hours into it, but I'd have gladly payed more for it for what enjoyment I've already received.   Now, the question a lot of people want to know is....how similar is this to Overwatch? Well, it isn't. The way the characters handle can feel like Overwatch, especially with your abilities but that's where the similarities end. I haven't played PVP so I can't weigh in on that yet, but for the PVE I'd liken it to a cross between Overwatch and Destiny gameplay, with Borderlands style comedy. Granted, it doesn't beat any of those games in a specific category...(Overwatch has better characters with abilities, Destiny had a more open world and better gunplay, Borderlands was funnier)....it's the fact that this game is able to blend those together so well, and it doesn't fail in any category.    All in all, it could use a little polish here and there, but overall this is definitely worth picking up. Especially if you're not paying full price. I'd probably give it a 7/10-7.5/10 on any other website, but on Steam I'll have to settle for a YES I'd recommend this.",

Before you would have to unlock some of the heroes, however after the Winter update, all the core heroes will be unlocked at the start.

The main missions are about 45 minutes each and each dlc mission are promised to be roughly 25 minutes. Completing a mission will reward you with gear and in-game currency which you can buy loot packs. Loot pack contain new gear, taunts and skins for your heroes.   I haven't played much of pvp so... meh.  The problem playing in the steam version that the population is low and matchmaking is region locked so there's never a full team of five.
