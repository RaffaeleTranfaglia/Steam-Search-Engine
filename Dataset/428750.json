I don't get a whole lot of time to commit to one game at one sitting, so this is a nice mix with instant gratification. No game is for everyone, but I love the music and graphical design on Neon Chrome. The engine is perfect, and while I have a top of the line gaming rig, this also runs just fine my older gaming laptop and a $150 mini PC I purchased for media on my TV. It's very well designed, and I am guessing they'll just keep making it better. You will die. You will die a lot. It's the way the game is designed so well, that you won't be frustrated by it (at least I wasn't). It's a little confusing at first, but put some stats in 'luck' so you'll get more loot, which will help you level up your other skills faster. I didn't read any guides for this game (although maybe I should have), but being able to hack the boxes with your character definitely helps at the beginning. I didn't look to see how many hours I have logged before writing this review, because I never really write that many, but I just beat it and am on 2.0. I have leveled my skills fairly far for 1.0, but I was just having fun playing the game. It's worth the price in my opinion. There are some attributes you earn that make the game a lot easier, but it seems to have a good balance. I'll give it a 8/10,",

            "review_text": "  -All Aboard the Cyberpunk Train!-  Get ready to climb ladder of the future! You play as an asset, here to stop the evil Overseer - A controlling AI that is the mind of Neon Chrome. In this future, complete and absolute trust is required to have the luxury of residing in said Neon Chrome. Once the Overseer caught wind of your sentience, well, you're simply marked for 'removal'. Teams of baddies, not to mention their robot machine-gun counterparts will stop at nothing to carry out exactly what the twisted leader demands.   There are no two ways about it, Neon Chrome is absolutely visually stunning. I cannot express how gorgeous and sleek everything looks from the start up screen, to the actual gameplay. The menus are slick and make you feel like you're completely immersed. Loading times are notably fast too--some of the quickest I've ever seen. If you're like me, and are just waiting in line for your next go at dying, this softens the blow and starts to desensitize you. Coupled with the safe room, where you get to upgrade, tweak and choose your next character, the game makes sure you start with confidence. But the higher you climb the cyberpunk rungs, the more expensive it all becomes.   -A Different Experience Every Time-  Neon Chrome has a unique level loader that randomizes every situation. Unlike Hotline Miami, where you can master every move and learn to own a level down to a centimeter--this game will move it all around and switch layouts up to keep you on your toes. As Neon Chrome is the towering skyscraper of Neon Corp, this special randomization feature makes you feel like you really are climbing your way through a never-ending building.   After Guardian of Light, I became a massive fan of the twin stick shooting genre. This is a game that makes sure you get all the fun squeezed out of it too. It's fast and reflexive. I won't lie, I'm not very good at this game, but it doesn't change the fact that I enjoyed every minute of playing it. Perhaps the Overseer got the best of my assets time and time again, but I can assure you good reader, that this little engine that could will keep coming back for the pain. Since every new turn is such a drastic change from the last, the monotony of playing the same thing over and over is completely broken up. Your assets are different people with endlessly different abilities. Each level is packed with exploding bits of environment, locked doors, keymasters and upgrading stations. No shortage of weaponry here, they've clearly strived to make nothing seem repetitive, which is a huge win for any game.  -The Future Is Well-Maintained-  Aside from it's being a great game as it is, it seems like the developers are constantly listening and improving on what is already something amazing. Being in touch with their fanbase, they've lowered the difficulty of the bosses, giving everyone a fair fight with more health pickups and tweaking the upgrade system to better suit our needs. Something neat that was also mentioned was the use of mods and how they're very actively supporting them (at your own risk!) to the point where it's easily accessible through the main menu. It's been mentioned that support could be implemented to make them more stable, but this would be pending on the sales of the game itself.   From the mind melting visuals that will leave your brain salivating, to the haunting, hallow voice of the Overseer--this game will satisfy your lust to take down an evil corporation of the future. You'll enjoy tailored gameplay that runs like a well-oiled machine with this one--it's not to be missed!  -ChickenSupreme/Gamesxtreme.com ",

            "review_text": "Really fun game with lots of replay value. So far no two runs have been alike. The 'rouge leagacy' setting made me eager to go an explore. Boss fights, attack squads and secret levels also are clever placed to interrupt the mayham just enough to change the pace of the game. The different classes hacker, assassin, soldier, techie and (my favorite) cyber psycho also make the playstyle a little different so you can enjoy another angle to the desctruction.  For me the graphics appears better than in the screenshots and the video. And its true - you can lay waste and destroy almost anything on the map which is just appropriate for the really well-implemented cyberpunk setting. This includes also the music of the game, which I enjoy a lot, too.  I recommend the game to anyone who is into cyberpunk and/or twin-stick shooters. I use an X-Box controller to play, but I have seen movies on youtube using mouse and keyboard, so I guess it is also enjoyable that way .... ",

            "review_text": "I have only played 5 hours of the game as of this review, but I can already say that it's one of my favorite rogue-like games to come out in quite a while.  Neon Chrome has a slightly slower pace to the combat than most twin-stick rogue-likes that I have played, and that gives it a really unique feeling compared to others.  No dodge button means that using cover is important, and since it's destructable, the game can really make you think on your feet at times. The gunplay feels great, and the progression system is rewarding so far. The different 'classes' are different enough to feel unique, but still balanced enough to where I can't pick a favorite, and none stand out as the 'best' at everything.  I'm a big fan of the setting and little bit of story that I have encountered so far. The cyber-punk asthetic is pretty cool, and the fact that the game uses polygons and not pixel art is refreshing (I can't believe I have to say that).  The music is FANTASTIC. It fits the theme perfectly.  After five hours straight of playing the game, my only real complaint is that there is no rumble support if using a controller.   I saw that the game was made by the makers of Crimsonland, a game that I was obsessed with over a decade ago. I took a chance and picked it up based only on that, and I am glad I did. This game hits a lot of sweet spots for me.",

I like the pace of the combat, the environment interactions, and things like the level length / difficulty curve seem just right.  However, at some point developers need to figure out that they don't understand in the slightest what roguelikes are all about, and stop trying to shoehorn in 'roguelike elements' that are really just stupid nonsense. PERSISTENCE IS NOT ROGUELIKE. Persistence is the very opposite of roguelike!   And on top of that, persistent unlocks that simply increase your damage and health by flat amounts or percentages across all playthroughs are a lousy form of persistence, and this game is chock full of them. If you desperately needed to include unlocks in order to satisfy those weird people out there who play games for unlocks rather than the actual gameplay, the weapon unlock system is fine and could have been kept pretty much as-is.  This is not a roguelike/lite and the developers do not understand what that even means. Just stick to making good action games instead of shoveling in bad unlock mechanics.",
