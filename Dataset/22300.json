The only downsides to this game is that it requires a fanmade patch to run on Windows 10. Also, for some reason the game never integrated properly with the Steam client on my PC, probably due to GFWL. So I never had access to the Steam overlay as I played, and it never counted my hours played. Despite the hour count you see above, I actually played this for dozens and dozens of hours.",

Ingredients:  1 cup digestive plain sweet biscuit crumbs 3 tablespoons sugar 3 tablespoons melted butter 40 ounces softened cream cheese 1 cup sugar 3 tablespoons flour 1 tablespoon vanilla 1 cup sour cream 4 eggs  Directions: For The base:. If you're using a dark pan, preheat the oven to 350. If you are using a shiny pan, 375. Combine the crumbs, melted butter and 3 tbsp sugar well and pat onto the bottom of a 9 inch springform pan. I also like to very very lightly butter the sides of the pan so that the cheesecake will not stick later on. Bake for 10 mins in your preheated oven and remove. Let it cool while you prepare your batter. For the batter:. Make sure everything is at room temperature. Combine sugar, cheese, flour and vanilla in a big bowl and mix on medium speed till well combined. Don't forget to scrape the bowl as you're doing this. Mix in the sour cream till its incorporated well. Then, add the eggs one by one, mixing well after each addition. Pour the batter into the springform and let it bake for 1 hour and 10 minutes After the baking time, turn off the oven and leave the door ajar. Let the cake cool in there for about 1 1/2 hours. Remove the cake and let it cool thoroughly. Refrigerate overnight. Release the sides of the springform. Eat.",

Level Cap?Maximum level is 30.Oh come on Bethesda.Most fun thing about RPG's is the when you are in low level's enemies come kick your ♥♥♥ and you level up more and more to get your revenge.Thats one of the main things that makes rpg games.You have to be powerfull than anything.But thanks to PC Master Race we can mod it and upgrade the level cap.Another thing bad about level cap is that you can get 10 level more....If you buy the dlc.The game is also buggy.I haven't come across any game breaking bugs (atleast on the game's main story) but there are some.The game also has an unique mechanic called 'V.A.T.S' where you can use it to select body parts of the enemies.It ll save your ♥♥♥ A LOT.Other thing's that makes fallout 3 unique is its envoirments its well designed.One annoying thing about them is you ll come across boarded door's a lot. Enemies are well designed and surprizely i haven't seen one ai problem with them.But followers oh boy the followers.If you enter your home to go to sleep they ll block your way and only way around is to use cheats.Oh yeah that reminded me another thing that is wrong with game.Fallout 3 followers can die.What the ♥♥♥♥? seriously?!?!.Good thing is that you can fix this problem with mods.Modding community is large and really helpfull.They ll give you a hand. I give this game 7/10 (acceptable).For more fallout 3 head over to ig-just kidding.♥♥♥♥ those guys.Thanks for reading my review. :)",

            "review_text": "Good day once again close friends and strangers of the vast and dangerous internets, I have returned for another review. This time, of Fallout 3. Shall we get started?  To start, I have to say I don't think I've ever experienced a more enjoyable character customisation than the one found in this game. It was full of humour and interesting choices (and said interesting choices often lead to more humour) and this theme continues throughout the duration of the game. Some notable choices include the chace to explode one of the only decent cities in the game, and the opportunity to commit genocide (that's going to remain without context; I don't want to spoil it for you). I honestly can't wait to jump back in and get back to making choices. CHOICES!!!!!!  There's plenty of content in this game. In most of my reviews I mention that there's a need for extra content, or so much of the same type of content that it got stale but, much like the story of goldilocks, this bed was just right (How can a bed be too soft?!) I liked how the game was riddled with locked doors that could only be opened if you had a certain science or lock picking skill  The storyline was admirable, but not incredible. It basically consisted of 'You're dad's gone missing, go find 'im' and then turns into 'Genocide, yes or no?' However, I really did like the way the environment and various notes and computers could tell their own story and add depth to the game. Not enough games do this. The last of which that I've played was Mass Effect and before that, Skyrim (Both of these score a 10/10, btw)(Although, Mass Effect loses points for not publishing the third one on Steam) Often enough, reading journal entries could reveal more about what was actually going on in the environment. For example, in one particular moment, test chambers had dead mutated humans and, upon walking into these rooms, you could discover that they still contain radiation. This in itself mightn’t reveal much, but reading some journal entries shows who was responsible for these deaths (I shall say no more.)  Now to mechanics. This game was built by Bethesda, so I thought I should mention that I noticed some similar mechanics in both of the games. However, obviously because this game is set in a post apocalyptic Washington D.C and not Viking Tamriel (And I'm not just saying that because of the helmets) There were some different and welcome variations between the two. For staters, the skill trees were far different. I actually liked the one in Fallout slightly (SLIIIIIIIGHTLY) better, although I can't really figure out why. However, I didn't really like how the currency in the game (Bottle caps) Were difficult to come by without performing getting bad karma (And I really wanted the good ending.) I honestly can't remember if I bought anything at all in this game. I just horded my caps until the end (Although, at times I wished I'd repaired my combat shotgun or purchased some health kits) For most weapons (All the weapons? I don't know, I didn't try them all out) There weren't any scopes, which made aiming excessively difficult. There was a cool system that allowed you to target a specific part of the body of your enemy and gave you a percentage chance of you hitting it. This was a great idea, but it was performed badly. A still, unaware target, regardless of the distance, should have a high percentage of hit. This wasn't always the case. Even a target standing 12 cm from your face only had a 95% chance of hit (SERIOUSLY, CHARACTER. DO YOU HAVE TOUURETTES?!) I would've disregarded this mechanic entirely except for the bonus critical chance it offers.   The art style was good. I liked the way everything, even the towns, looked so make-shift and finding American monuments completely exploded was somewhat satisfying (I'm getting arrested for saying that, huh?) The graphics were decent, especially considering when this game was created.  All right, let us summarise.  Character customisation: Good Content: Excellent Mechanics: Satisfactory Art style: Good  I'm just about done. Final verdict- 8.3131932524020387829/10 Thanks for reading.",

            "review_text": "Hi there! This game is Fallout 3, a post-apocalyptic game from the wonderful developers of Bethesda Softworks. This game is over 6 years old, but despite the short main story in the game, there's still a good amount of content to go about. The game world is open, the Capital Wasteland is inhabited by many things, some friendly but most things you'll meet are going to want to tear you apart and use your skull for decorating. But how about the DLC? Well I'll tell you. The only DLC that I have currently is called 'Operation Anchorage', the story of the DLC is that in broad strokes you're helping fight the Red Chinese in the American Reconquest of Alaska, it gives you an insight into how a soldier lived before the Great War, daily putting his life at stake for the greater good of America, and the defense against Communism! You also need a DLC to continue playing after you continue the main storyline though... I don't know, I don't mind myself, but of course the DLC also gives you an expansion to the story, which I won't really go into, because it would spoil some... Things... Let's keep it at that, I guess you may have already had it spoiled anyways but I wouldn't wanna be the person that does it. Beware though, multiple people are complaining about the game being unstable on Windows 7 and even more so on 10 I've only had it crash twice, one being because I messed with the game files... I only had one glitch as well, and it wasn't gamebreaking. Questions I'd like to ask myself if I had no idea about Fallout:  Q: Why wouldn't I buy Fallout 1 and 2 or Tactics first?  A: You can do that, but the three first games are different to 3 and New Vegas in the sense that it's isometric top-down view in those games. There are also major graphical glitches on some system, but they should be fixable with an unofficial patch somewhere I believe... In comparison to newer Fallout games, which can be played either as 3rd person, or 1st person, I personally play as 1st person because it's more immersive.  Q: Is there/what is the levelcap of Fallout 3 without any DLC and does DLC make a difference for the levelcap?  A: In comparison to Fallout New Vegas where the levelcap can be 50 with all the DLC (30 without any at all) Fallout 3 only has a levelcap of 20, however this can be raised to 30 if you have the Broken Steel DLC, which is also the name of the DLC that allows you to play on after the end of the main Story.  Q: What are the main differences between Fallout 3 and New Vegas?  A: There's a number of them, mainly the factions system that they included in New Vegas, and also the removal of percentage chance to have a successful special dialogue option in favor for the more simple 'Have X amount of points in Y skill, and you will be successful in this special dialogue.' There are mods however, that allow you to switch it back I believe. Also that Fallout 3 by default has a color filter that makes everything look greener, whereas in New Vegas it makes the game look more orange-yellowy. There is a mod to turn this off called Fellout for both games, and I highly recommend it as I like being able to see specific colors instead of them being tinted either green or yellow. The locations are also vastly different as Fallout 3 takes place in the bombed ruins of Washington D.C and New Vegas takes place in the Mojave desert at Las Vegas (New Vegas in the game, surprise surprise) also the ability to disguise onself as a faction is New Vegas... It's something I don't really use but it can definitely be helpful in some situations, like when you don't wanna cause a shootout, and need to stay stealthy.  This has been my review for Fallout 3 and I hope you liked it, patient reader. At first I thought I would just adress that the game is far from unplayable with Windows 7/10 as some people claim that it is, but it may vary from system to system I suppose. Thank you for reading, and I hope I convinced you somewhere along the way to buy Fallout 3.",

As a gamer what is important, is the fun you have with the game not the graphics, fallout 3 is really fun and a very well made game, and is by far more fun to play then fallout 4. In my personal opinion this game is better then fallout 4 and a bit worst then New Vegas. If you love Action RPGs this is a 'most play' game for you. I will try to explain the diference between all 3 games. Fallout 3 overall is better then fallout 4 except in the graphics. And fallout 3 overall is a bit worst then New Vegas except in the story, I think the fallout 3 story is better then New Vegas Story.

But I gave it a shot and I say it is not so bad. Well the beginning is amusingly ridiculous when they act with you like with infant and literally, but it made me laugh and it is really nice to see power armor animated in full 3D model.  The gameplay is pretty much like Oblivion, it is pretty obvious that is from the same creators. If you dont mind it you can play it. If you dont like oblivion style gaming, you can still play old 1 or 2 if you didnt played it yet. But what I really cant swallow is the ending, which is pretty linear and very 'hero' like. And hero like I mean stupid as hell. I would push the NO recommend button just because of that lame and corny ending, but luckily you can go ahead and download mod alternate ending, or just forget the main line and just enjoy those few side quests which are pretty fun. And for the first start, the best option is always set inteligence to 9 and google info about bobbleheads.  Oh and if you'll meet Uncle Leo send him regards by me!",

            "review_text": "I could make a joke about this game then say '10/10' at the end, but I believe this game deserves more than that.  This game is absolutely incredible, anyone who says its anything less of a masterpiece is mentally handicapped.  First of all, the area to explore is massive, I have over 200+ hours on it (I played a lot of it while on offline mode, so the hours on my account don't show the full amount) and I still havn't gotten around to looking over all of the areas.  Second of all, the quests are amazing. Starting off with the main story, it is incredibly fun. From starting as a kid in the vault to fighting off the Enclave forces alongside a gigantic robot named Liberty Prime, it is a non-stop good time.  As for the DLC's, most are equally incredible. Broken Steel, The Pitt, and Point Lookout are all amazing to say the least. While Broken Steel adds onto the main story and raises the level cap, The Pitt and Point Lookout give you entirely new quests and areas to explore, both of which are awesome. To a lesser extent, Operation Anchorage and Mothership Zeta are both somewhat decent addons, but failed to meet my expectations. Operation Anchorage was very short, I finished it in about 2 hours without rushing it, and Mothership Zeta was incredibly repetative and dont even get me started on what it attempted to do to the Lore.  Alongside the Main Quests and DLC's, many of the side quests are also fantastic. One that really caught me off guard was a short little quest called 'Oasis' in which after exploring the dull wasteland, you find yourself in a lush green paradise, where you meet a mutated man-turned-tree named Harold. The story is quite interesting, and depending on which ending you chose, can leave you quite upset.  Now lets talk about the graphics. Yes this game is a bit outdated, but I for one think it looks fairly decent, and still hold up to some games today. As for the textures, they are quite flat, but I dont think you will really be paying attention to that while your gunning your way through hordes of Super Mutants and Ghouls.  The enemies in this game are also amazing. There are plenty of enemies scattered across the Capitol Wasteland, from little pests like Radroaches and Bloatflies to the incredibly strong Deathclaws and Super Mutant Behemoths, there is little time to sit around a campfire and sing ballads about your fallen comrads before a gang of Raiders come to ruin your good time.  These Raiders wont be much trouble however if your properly equiped. This game comes with a bunch of weapons which are all fun to use, such as the Combat Shotgun, the Hunting Rifle, and everyones favourite, the Fat Man. Most of these weapons also come with one or more 'Unique' variations, which usually grant higher damage or special abilities, all of which are very useful when things start to get a little rough.  Lastly, entertainment. I am not stretching this at all, and I dont think what Im about to say will change anytime soon. This game is the best game I have ever played. It is absolutely insane how good this game is. If I could play only 1 game for the rest of my life, it would be this. The story is great, the graphics are good, the area to explore is huge, the enemies are awesome, the replayability is off the charts, and if you ever start to get bored, a quick look over at the Nexus will keep you playing for hours on end. Now that ive said all this, I can honestly say...  420/69",

The sound work though is rather stale at places, which makes the enjoyment less enjoyable for audiophiles. The music is by all the great artists in the past, who makes killing people so enjoyable in the sweet tunes of classics.  The voice acting is great, though voices are often reused for new characters.  It is good to hear Paul Eiding's voice, even though he only play old characters.  Overall, it is a long game and you need to explore alittle to fully enjoy fallout 3.  Highly recommended for the wastelanders.",

First of all I'll adress negatives; The game is VERY dark. (this isnt a negative for all people, but for me it is, I like bright colorful scenes, with a more realistic story) Another negative is well, Later on in the story there isnt VERY much to do, although you'll find quests what bothers me is, you'll find a city with 50+ and only 1 or 2 people will give you something to do. Another thing is the ♥♥♥♥ING ACCURACY IN VATS IS AWFUL, IVE BEEN FACE FIRST WITH OVER 500 MOBS WITH A .44 REPEATER ONLY TO MISS, JESUS CHRIST. And lastly in my Cons is Optimization. some people have it worse some people have it ok, luckily i was the Ok side. The game crashes every 4 or so hours and alt-tabbing means you have to restart the entire game. Also controller support is god awful, (THE GAME HAS GWOL CAREFUL!!!)  Where do I start with the good? Jesus christ man this game, the story is godly, the dialouge options are amazing not to mention the way the ending is molded based on your choices. You'll have follows based on karma, exclusive rewards for doing good or bad deeds, it just never ends. The guns go on and on, combat is actually fun, your limbs get crippled and the game is realistic. It isnt some COD ♥♥♥♥ where i find ammo on every body i see, I literally need to scavenge and use my rarer rounds (.44, 308 etc) wisley and dont find them off little timmy's body. Not to mention the atmosphere (although i hate dark games) goes INCREDIBLEY WELL. The games characters and factions even put into a proper perspective what happens in such an enviorment, although ill end my review here, please, pick up this game either on a console or a PC (optimization on PC is ♥♥♥♥) but play it, just play it.",

Fallout 3 is an epic experience that manages to channel the odd combination of dark humor and bleak despair of the original series.",

I know its cheesy to say, but this ♥♥♥♥ has changed my life, No doubt, exaggeration, anything. I love this game to death, each bit of the game brings me back when I was younger playing this. At times, if you've played this game, skull♥♥♥♥ed it in and out, then it gets a bit boring after a while. Then you might stop playing it for a bit, but eventually there is this type of feeling, or 'mood' you get, and it makes you say 'God I need to start playing Fallout 3 again!' I honestly do not understand the ratings for this game currently. 76% and 81% Postive! Still thats alright however this should be overwhlemingly postive. The vanilla game itself is actually really good and I reccomend you play it that way. (For people who've never played it previously) Only recently, I'd say the end of 2014 I got my first laptop that I am currently using now. Watching AlChestBreach's Fallout 3 and New Vegas mod videos, (at the time I only had a console) I knew that I had to learn how to mod. For a couple month's I had no idea, but HOL-Y HELL WHEN I INSTALLED MODS. . The mods are amazing on this game, and if you get bored from the current mods you use. Get new ones! Add on to those! It's also pretty easy to learn how to mod. And still, even now mods are still being made frequently on the nexus. After you get some mods, you'll never want to go back to the vanilla game. Another thing you might wanna know if that the community is the ♥♥♥♥ing best for the whole Fallout series, it's just the newcomers since Fallout 4 has came out has kinda plagued it, but for the most part, it's pretty good, it's kinda hard to find a 'Fallout Buddy' you can talk to and is as dedicated and has sold their soul to this game as you or I have. There is bugs, yes, but mods fix those easy.  The best thing about this game is that the game is probably the most memorable, the storyline is pretty good, the combat is excellent in my opinion. The area, The Washington D.C. Wasteland is excellent area to explore. The enemies are ♥♥♥♥ing wicked at times. From the standard raider, with its freaky masks, its spikey armor with human hands hanging form its belt, to the Centaurs and Deathclaws. Centaurs give me the heebie jeebies, I'll let you find those. I love going on a 'Scav Run' (i'm a big roleplayer in these games) and going back to my house, and building that weapon with the materials I found. From a 'Shiskebab' a flaming sword made from a lawn mower blade and a motorcycle tank filled with oil to fire it up. Not to mention there is some badass gore in this.. There is a perk system that you have that when you level up, it allows you to select a perk, that lets you have different abilities and its just downright ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. 'Bloody Mess' is my personal favorite. THE MUSIC IN THIS GAME IS QUITE AMAZING BY THE WAY, you can tune in on radio stations any time!  DLC  -Point Lookout~ Basically a nightmarish countryside area that takes place in Maryland, a small twist, and mutated people with axes and rifles, 'Hillbillies' if you will, Hah.  -Mothership Zeta~ A super cheesy but amazing expansion where you go out in the middle of nowhere and get abducted by aliens, It's amazing trust me. I'm afraid I didn't do it justice.  -The Pitt~ Practially a ♥♥♥♥ing nightmare. God this one is brutal, you travel to Pittsburg which is a huge slaver outpost and a disgusting plauge going around, you can see people's skin falling apart, but tough ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s they are. Deciding to chose to help the slaves or join the slavers. Definetly one of my favorites.  -Broken Steel~ This one is alright I guess. It adds where you can still play after you finish the game, adding some quests. It also raises the level cap to 30, which is nice. But not the best DLC  -Operation Anchorage~ This one is not bad especially after the insane loot reward after. You go into a simulation of the war between the Americans and the Communinst, in Anchorage, Alaska. I like it, It's pretty fun though, I thought at least.  Final Verdict (Vanilla/Base Game): 9.5/10  Thanks for you're time!  ~Bye!",

For one reason and one reason only, it keeps on freezing and crashing with most people on the internet, and I am one of those victoms. My advise? Dont pick up this game, pick up Fallout: New Vegas. New Vegas can work for Windows 7.  Dont get me wrong, Fallout 3 is a great game. But the sole fact that you cant play Fallout 3 on W7 just really disappoints me. I have look up tutorials on how to fix these issues, and I still got those problems. And the main problem is that Bethseda wont fix this, and they are currently not improving on this.  If you want to play Fallout 3, just buy it for your PS3 or Xbox 360, grab the Game of the Year while your at it. Yeah, you wont play with mods, but atleast you'll still be playing the game.  Edit: 12/9/2014. Recently, I modified my Fallout 3 launcher and game to be compatible for Windows 7, a simple fix. The game runs fine, but I did encountered some lag spikes from time to time, and some freezes there and here (However, I did managed to complete two quests without encountering some freezes. Only time I encountered a freeze was in my Megaton house, which happened two times. The second time happened a few seconds after starting up the game again)  But man, the jump to the PC is awesome. There is a lot I can see that I couldnt see in the console ports! I do recommend this game, its pretty fun.",

The replay value is very high. I've clocked in close to 300 hours on this game and in my second run through, I am still finding quests and areas that I hadn't the first time. If you like role-playing game elements, 1st person shooters, wide-open worlds for exploration, and a game with tons of side-quests, this game is for you.",

Fallout is a third and first person RPG open world game that is set in a post-apocalyptic retro-future world. Fallout 3 takes place in the year 2277, 36 years after the setting of Fallout 2 and 200 years after the nuclear apocalypse that devastated the game's world in a future where international conflicts between the United States and China culminated in a Sino-American war in 2077.   In Fallout 3 your decisions always have an effect on the story, for example if you choose to kill this person or let this person live the ending will be different depending on the decisions you make and the people you kill will never respawn so you must make a good choice as each decision has a consequence.   After you have finished the main storyline there is many other things to do from a range of different side-missions to exploring the openworld. Overall I give this game a 8/10 the story is not as powerful as the previous Fallout games as everything else is fantastic the story is what needs working on. Still despite having a weak and boring story I still think FO3 is fantastic in terms of openworld and gameplay.   If you don't really care too much about the weak and horrible story and you are only getting it for the open world and gameplay features then I suggest you go and get this epic game I am absolutely sure it will blow you away without a doubt!.",

Guess what? I AM RUNNING IT ON A WINDOWS 8 COMPUTER. It's simple, all you have to do is download the update for 'Games for Windows Live'.    What lies beyond that update is a world of Super Mutants, Zombies, assault rifles, hookers, mini-catapults that shoot mini-nukes, severely enlargened animals and bugs (most of which try to kill you), missing fathers, guys who try to make you blow up settlements, blown up settlements, and much more! Oh, and a huge city where you blow sh!t up, and test all of the above. Almost forgot the totally ironic 50's culture... Overall, I'd give this game a 9/10. People say it's like 'Skyrim with guns'. However, it's much more than 'Skyrim with guns'. Imagine the world of Skyrim with guns. Now imagine that world with a huge city in the middle, then the whole thing was blown up with radiation seeping through about everything, and people heavily affeted by said radiation, and a 19-year-old kid (you) who either goes around killing these creatures and being the savior of the citizens of the wasteland, or goes around killing everyone, taking their wealth and working with the 'president' (a super-computer with evil AI) to create some sort of 'utopia', where you 2 and the 'enclave' are the only inhabitants. ALL OF THE ABOVE DESCRIBE THIS GAME. Have you ever tried out a texture pack for Minecraft called 'last days'? THIS IS THAT. It has a very strong post-apocalyptic survival feel to it. Then you get mods.   The modding community isn't as present with this game as it is for 'Fallout: New Vegas', but still pretty nice. You can add thousands of new weapons, new creatures, and new places to explore. You can turn the wasteland into a true unforgiving hell of a place, or you can make it a beautiful tropical paradise with mutated horrors awaiting you, like I did (Dead Island?). You can add in so many perks, it's like your character's a god when it's all said and done, or make the overall theme of survival EXTREMELY present, having to actually eat 3 meals a day, with drinks included. You can add in amazing vehicles, or make travelling a chore.   In conclusion, I would HIGHLY reccomend this game. Enough said. The only reason it says I played so few hours on this is because I use FOSE (look it up), which doesn't rcord playtime. But I would imagine my playtime would be in the high hundreds right about now.",

You can blow up a town with a nuke, enough said. The gameplay is very well done with a variety of weapons and other objects to use aginst the infected gouls, super mutants and other humans who want your blood, (as well as other animals you may come across like the fire ant).   Some drawbacks are the A.I., some of your allies might get in your way while fighting, and if you are playing on the lowest difficulty you may not even fire a shot since they have already killed the enemy. Another thing, (which does not affect me), is how much of an open world it is. This map is massive and you are going to be walking to many of your destinations by foot, so if you are not a patient gamer, then well, this is not the game for you.  In my conclusion, if your are a fan of open world games that let you decide the future of the game's story, then it is a total buy, if not then just stay clear of this game and go by another generic linear shooter.  8/10 Barack Obama's",

They each had stories behind them instead of just, 'Hey go get me some random generic item.' Like the wasteland survival quest. This lady wants to write a book about surviving in the wasteland so she has you go out and do multiple things like raiding an abandoned store, or testing out a weapon that's 'supposed to' repel mole rats.  The story was also intriguing, although it wasn't all that much it still kept me going. The weapons are also very fun to use, my favorite one is either the Shishkebab, or the laser rifle. I highly recommend this game, but if you're using a pc that's past Windows 7 you'll have to make some modifications so here's a link to fixing that.

Guess what? I AM RUNNING IT ON A WINDOWS 8 COMPUTER. It's simple, all you have to do is download the update for 'Games for Windows Live'.    What lies beyond that update is a world of Super Mutants, Zombies, assault rifles, hookers, mini-catapults that shoot mini-nukes, severely enlargened animals and bugs (most of which try to kill you), missing fathers, guys who try to make you blow up settlements, blown up settlements, and much more! Oh, and a huge city where you blow sh!t up, and test all of the above. Almost forgot the totally ironic 50's culture... Overall, I'd give this game a 9/10. People say it's like 'Skyrim with guns'. However, it's much more than 'Skyrim with guns'. Imagine the world of Skyrim with guns. Now imagine that world with a huge city in the middle, then the whole thing was blown up with radiation seeping through about everything, and people heavily affeted by said radiation, and a 19-year-old kid (you) who either goes around killing these creatures and being the savior of the citizens of the wasteland, or goes around killing everyone, taking their wealth and working with the 'president' (a super-computer with evil AI) to create some sort of 'utopia', where you 2 and the 'enclave' are the only inhabitants. ALL OF THE ABOVE DESCRIBE THIS GAME. Have you ever tried out a texture pack for Minecraft called 'last days'? THIS IS THAT. It has a very strong post-apocalyptic survival feel to it. Then you get mods.   The modding community isn't as present with this game as it is for 'Fallout: New Vegas', but still pretty nice. You can add thousands of new weapons, new creatures, and new places to explore. You can turn the wasteland into a true unforgiving hell of a place, or you can make it a beautiful tropical paradise with mutated horrors awaiting you, like I did (Dead Island?). You can add in so many perks, it's like your character's a god when it's all said and done, or make the overall theme of survival EXTREMELY present, having to actually eat 3 meals a day, with drinks included. You can add in amazing vehicles, or make travelling a chore.   In conclusion, I would HIGHLY reccomend this game. Enough said. The only reason it says I played so few hours on this is because I use FOSE (look it up), which doesn't rcord playtime. But I would imagine my playtime would be in the high hundreds right about now.",

Your father Dr. James, was scientist for Project 'Purity' which would give clean tap water for anyone in the Capital Wasteland (Washington D.C and surrounding area). When you turned 16 your father escaped from Vault 101, he was the first one to Escape/Leave the Vault. but that made huge disturbance in the Vault 101, which caused everyone to blame you, well not everyone, few friends from childhood didn't. As you try to escape vault, you will find a lot of people shooting at you and BUGS. Not glitches bugs, actual Bugs, like cockroaches and stuff... You escape Vault 101, as you escape it. You will see the door what lead to the Wasteland where you can SEE that Monument infront of the White house and half of Washington D.C (end of spoilers) The storyline is perfect. Voice acting is just WOW, its EPIC! There are few minor glitches but its not hard to just take them out of the picture! As in every fallout Game you have choices to make; and those choices will be important in the near future of your gameplay So be careful when you choose something, okay?

I would recommend modding this with some performance and optimization mods before playing.  I really enjoyed this game. Unlike games similar to this such as Skyrim and New Vegas (Both came out after this, I know) this game is a lot easier to get into. I dislikes both Skyrim and New Vegas at first and found I had to play a few hours before getting into it, FO3 got me right from the start. The main story is interesting (not very choice dependent as it seems sadly). The ruins of D.C gave me a great time while I explored it and fought of Super Mutant. The Metros were like mazes and filled with everything from loot and gangs to fire breathing ants and you can get lost in them, and that isn't a bad thing. Make your way across the Captital Wasteland on the surface or in the extensive Metro system, both offer different experiences.  This game captures the post-apocalyptic feel and the stuggle for survival great. It can be a challenging game as supplies are limited and mutants and bandits are out to get you, as well as each other. The side quests are also interesting and plentiful (However I didn't get to do many). At the time of writing this review I don't own the DLC but I do intend to buy them so I can run the TTW mod for Fallout New Vegas allowing me to play Fallout 3 on New Vegas's modified engine (I would also recommend you do this if you own both 3 and NV with all the DLC as you can play with a lot less issues (But still some issues of course if running with other mods)).  If you're looking for a great story with a great atmosphere and characters, Fallout 3 if your game. If you're looking for a more open world (Not to say Fallout 3 isn't open world but it can be less open in cities and in the metros if you choose to go there) and/or choice making that matters to the game's plot then I would say get Fallout New Vegas. Personally I prefer Fallout 3 over NV especially with TTW mod to make it more stable (Most mods work as well if you use TTW's patcher).  (Any information on TTW I have mentioned I have found via research, as I started I don't own the DLC ATM. I will update when I do... if I can be bothered/remember)  Same as any review I type, I don't expect them to be read and I'm bored. CBA spell checking soooo.... yeah.  Side note: Just to clear this up, I do only have 20 hours (and a couple extra on the XBox version that I never got around to playing much) but I am nowhere near done with this game but I do intend to finish it off (Side quests, exploring, ect) on the TTW mod.",

Fallout 3 is an exploration-shooter, often associated with Skyrim or Oblivion, also by Bethesda. Some even called Fallout 3 Oblivion with guns, and called Skyrim Fallout 3 without guns. It is a good game with a considerable amount of time put into it, and a considerable amount of time you can put into it. It has an intuitive VATS aiming system, that lets numbers decided whether or not you will get a hit. The beginning is extrodinarily slow, so I reccommend you install a mod that skips the intro, jutting you right out into the Capital Wasteland, the setting for the game. Overall, good and fun. 9/10",

A massive finely crafted RPG universe with nearly endless choice and an atmosphere you can loose yourself in for weeks, months.   All said this game depicts a haunting and highly atmospheric (albeit funny at times) look at the life after a cataclysmic nuclear war has ravaged the planet.",

It does have it's bugs here and there but you can always update it to 1.7 and get some of the unofficial patches which does make it way more stable. This game runs so much better on anything lower then windows 7. If you run with compatibility view it does before a little more stable. The mods and DLC for this game make it easy to spend hundreds of hours playing this game. I would happily suggest this game to anyone who wants a fun game to play. This is a fun game for people who love FPS and people who love RPGs so give it a try.",

To get it to work for windows 10: Download game through steam. Click play after download has finished, but exit once the launcher pops up. Go to the game in library, and browse local content. go to steamapps, and then common. Find Fallout launcher, then select the properties and compatability. Set it to run as admin. and in compatibility mode for Windows XP Service pack 3. Do the same for the game application. Then go to google and search games for window live, and download the first link. Last, play the game.  Should run decent with minor bugs (Froze a few times for me over the course of 5 hours). Only negatives I have seen besides the freezing is that steam doesnt seem to pick up that fallout 3 is being played, so no achievments can be earned, and friends can't see that you're playing it. (Explaining why my review shows that I have only played fallout for 0.1 hours.) Well made game, lots of fun.",

They're are some minor bugs but they are sometimes hilarious and easy to fix. Fallout 3 is so much different from the first two falllouts going from a 2D clicking based game to a open world explorer. Bethesda studios did very well on this one. With Fallout 4 coming out it makes Fallout 3 even better and seeing all the things I said were great then they're both amazing. WARNING: It can be a depressing game somtimes with no color and seeing the chared ruins of DC so be advised.

The Fallout series as a whole is legendary, but Fallout 3 claws its way to the tippy top of video game quality. The story is ensnaring, the dialogue witty, the world emmense and bottomless. It is hard to break away once you've started. It is fairly easy to simply lose yourself in the immersive details of the world. Honestly, the dialogue might be my favorite part. It is witty and sharp and really gives depth to the characters.  The story reveals itself in digestable layers as you make progress, so there is never too much or too little substance. You are always on the verge of discovering some secret, uncovering some heinous act. The karma system adds another dynamic level to an already dynamic and exciting game. You can become a saint or a devil, depending on your dialogue choices and actions. You can really mold your character.  The graphics, lighting, and physics of the world are top quality as well, giving a realistic edge to impossible events. It is invigorating to watch and play.  If you are a fan of the Fallout series you will enjoy this, if you play it as a standalone game you will love it. It is a masterpiece.  10/10",

The internal differences between that and vista were negligible, but apparently this game is such a hack that it has issues and Bethesda could not even be arsed to fix them within a year of the game's release (despite making content pack after content pack).  But that really should be par for the course for the most incompetent developers in PC gaming history. My personal favorite moron moment was the randomly-generated starting dungeon in Daggerfall that was impossible to complete because it didn't randomly generate an exit. At least that game had some redeeming qualities. Fallout 3 does not.  It doesn't make a damn bit of sense if you compare it to the other Fallouts, but the game is crap just on its own merits. Like every Bethesda game, the world is pointless and sterile and the quests are poorly written. The fact that it's set in the Fallout world just slaps insult on top of injury.  What kind of idiots design an entire town full of annoying as ♥♥♥♥ children in a game where you are specifically not allowed to kill children? In a series notable for being able to do things like murder children and become a slaver? This thing is just an embarrassment. Thank goodness I have the old Fallouts from  GoG.com  before Bethesda acted like whiney babies and removed their games from any DRM-free service. Of course they want to control your access to better games from the past: They can only make their design seem like the incompetent ♥♥♥♥-show that it is.  0 stars out of five. The fact that it will literally not run on a modern OS is its only redeeming quality. Oh yeah, and the fact that the game's heavy-handed (and obviously poorly written) story kills you at the very game. You won't be tempted to play this turd any more than you have to, provided you are on some kind of ancient, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ operating system needed to play it.  Steam gets an additional 0 stars out of five for continuing to sell a game that will not work on their service. No, a 'not optimized for' minimum (lack of) responsibility warning is not sufficient. The game *WILL NOT RUN* on windows 8. I don't care what Gabe Newell's burrito-stuffing fat ♥♥♥ says about Windows 8; it is fast and very stable.

Its very risky to play the game for me, because when it crashes, I have to restart my computer. I can't even open task manager to shut Fallout 3 down. It has MILLIONS of bugs, texture issues and stuff.  The whole start of the game is POINTLESS. You should have started at the vault gate just like Fallout classic. You waste time in a birthday, a test (which was soooo useless)  The game is very easy! Even on 'Hard' mode. You can just stand in one place and shoot an enemy until they are dead. A.I is very bad. They run into their deaths by running into gunfire, running into flames etc. Bad guys like mutants and raiders have really terrible weapons that can't do much dammage and make you feel like they aren't even trying. They don't take cover, they don't flank you, they just run at you. Like zombies. (or if they have guns, they walk slowly towards you). Traits make it soooo easy. There are NO downsides. because thats too scary for us.   The story was... really boring, the Dad seems like he was more important and I (the player) seem like I just walk around with a big gun shooting things with a thumb up my ♥♥♥ not really doing anything useful. Dad makes the story. The main story is completely damn boring and I bet everyone would agree. Its really short and boring. Side missions are way cooler. More thought went into it and its much more fun.  You make no meaningful choices in the game. At the start of the game you HAVE to fight the bunch guards. You have NO choice. You HAVE to kill them. You can't even talk your way through which is something that you could do in Fallout 1 and 2. You can't make a peaceful solution at the start of the game.  I know I seem like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ but this is my opinion, the graphics are really bad. Charracters look like plastic barbie dolls that got burnt or something. The world is... great? but the graphics are still bad in my opinion.  Game design is really miserable. It should have harder enemies and harder areas in further areas. The game treats you like a baby. You have a compass that tells you where to go. You don't get clues or strict directions to where to go and what to do. Fallout 1 and 2 has very good game design. You actually have to direct yourself where to go and be more aware of your surroundings. You have to THINK in fallout classic. Not just follow a marker.  Fallout is just a shooty game. A bad one. A very over rated game.  also, don't play as meele or unarmed cus it'll be hard for you to kill anyone and your companions kill before you do.",

I'm simply bewildered as to why such a good game can suck so bad. Today when i purchased the game, I went trhrough the steps of installing Direct X and started the game as I normallly would. Everything was going well. I started to customize my character and then the game froze. It's interesting because it's not normal for a game to freeze this way. When this game freezes, you have to type ctrl+alt+delete to exit the game when it freezes. I then sought help on the Steam forums because the Bethesda forums were no good because the only troubleshooting for the game was for the PC DVD version of the game and I know that the Steam version is slightly different. The steam forums said to go into my documents and change some settings. I checked my documents and there were no folders labeled with Fallout 3. I knew when I bought this game that it was not optimized for windows 7. Operating system is not a factor in this situation. Fallout 3.exe should work on Windows XP and above. You cannot blame this on the operating system. This is your fault. If you're going to claim that it's not optimized then you're forgetting that every other game on Steam works perfectly fine with Windows 7. Duke Nukem isn't optimized. Heck, even the original Half-Life wasn't optimized for windows 7, but you know what? It runs great. This is bullcrap. Ridiculous, apply yourself! *drops mic",

Spam m1 to kill something. The characters have very flat personalities. In Skyrim I walked around interested were I was going/were I currently am. In Fallout 3 I walked from quest to quest and skipped threw the dialoge, not even interested in what they were saying.  Conclueded: I can understand why people like it. But I don't like it because it's very boring and the level-design is grey-brown-ish and boring. I understand that Bethesda hasn't been able to do much with an acopolypse but some buildings destroyed by giant mutated roots or just simple vines could've been nice. I mean, it could be possible. I think there has already happened an atomic apocolypse since you've been born/befor you've been born. And you've grown up in a bunker/vault and you go out of it with 18 years, so I think in 18 there could've grown something. At least some grass or bushes.  I would'nt recommend it.",
