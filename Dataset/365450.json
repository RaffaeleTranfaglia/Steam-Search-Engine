The game let's you explore network systems by utilizing a variety of tools to crack systems, files, explore networks.

You exploit system flaws while looking for human error all while following a very mystical and wellmade storyline that gives the game a touch of crime roman feeling to it. It's always something new around the next corner and it never gets boring. You got quite good control over the pace of the game and there's always a variety of things to choose from. The game ha a great level of detail added, that any computer geek playing it will relate to and appreciate. The game has a great way of swapping the pace and you while you can mostly take your time, you will also be put to the test.",

            "review_text": "A very introspective look at UNIX commands and the general actions of hacking - which is basically accurate, but taking out the time required to accomplish these things (for example, you can solve port protocols within a few seconds, but IRL this might take hours).  Basically, if you want the 'reality' where you are the hacker in one of these movies (you're not playing the hacker, but ARE the hacker), then this is pretty spot-on. It just removes most of the tedium of the acitivites. This is not to say that the game isn't repetitive; it is, and remains true to its roots as a simulator. By nature, most simulators run off of repetitive actions which require muscle memory and timing in order to complete.  In actual fact, this is more of a puzzle-solving game. However, combined with some funny easter eggs (IRC chats can get hilarious) and honest-to-god methodology on the principles of hacking, this actually becomes enjoyable unless you just want to shoot things in the face (in which case, this is NOT the game for you).  Anyone who wants to work in software QA should be able to play this game comfortably, figure out most of the puzzles, and genuinely enjoy the experience. If you can't, don't take QA as a career. Because this in almost any form is what you do - all day, every day. I know this from 14 years of experience at that job in everything from game development to SAS or security software.  There are a few points I wish there were more of, or more developed. As game, it's pretty linear. There are nice little things like finding additional information on a server which gives you another terminal to hack, or a phone to break into, but these are too few and far between. It could be far more sandboxy if there were a freeform mode for points, which had sets of systems and connected devices which would allow you to randonly investigate things you found on another system. In this, you'd need a points system or something to gain (money, cred, whatever) - which would be a welcome addition to the game. I think another fun mode would be to actually use the system specs for the computer it was running on for memory, etc. as well as randonly generating in-game groups to become involved with, do missions for (from forums, etc.)  I recommend this game, just due to the simulation nature being captured very well. That being said, this game won't be for everyone. Much of the game is tedium and random investigation - which is exactly what hacking is about. One of the best missions which represents this is the 'Project Junebug' mission. You're basically let loose to figure out how to accomlish the task, you have a lot of reading to do to catch up on how to accomplish it, and there isn't any handholding. YOU have to do the tasks, to the best of your understanding, and figure out indeed, what those tasks are, and it involves multiple servers, and different methods of having the same outcome.",

It's in large part due to its phenomenal soundtrack and well-realised interface, but no game this year has made me feel like more of a badass than Hacknet. Its presentation is executed so well that every action you take feels like you've been doing them for years, like hacking into networks is just child's play.  It plays very much like a puzzle-adventure game, so if something like that is up your alley, it's really worth checking out.  Also, it's worth playing to see the final hacking sequence alone.",

The story kept me engaged and curious about what I might find on the next server. The animation and art adds to the reality and really makes you feel powerful. The music is simply fantastic. It changes for every mood as you progress and adds so much weight to every keystroke. There are little details all over the place, all fun and quite a few that got a legitimate laugh out of me. Mechanics got a touch repetative but with the striking events and diverse missions it is a flaw easily overlooked.  Strongly recommended.",

Something that i really like about this game is how they have been researching hacking and how terminals work. A newbeginner can easily pick this up and experienced users of command prompts and terminals can still pick this up and enjoy it. It's got some replay value with some stuff being randomly generated out of a pool of names etc... And in the future, the game will have multiplayer and mod support.

I don't have his login and password and I have no idea what to do. Er, I guess I'll do some random port scanning etc. I do some sort of scan and BAM I give myself admin access! OK now what?

Like the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ elite hacker that I am. I raise my hands and twiddle my fingers like there's fire coming out of them, because that's what just happened. The matrix style music augments it.

The topic? Oh no, not just 'Hacking' in the technical meaning of the term, but instead the ethical implications the inherent power of software development and manipulation in an interconnected world brings both for individuals and companies.   Want a good hacking simulator? Fine, you found it. Not as complex as Introversion's amazing, but aged, Uplink, Hacknet's mechanics are still very well thought out and are just a joy to use.  Want interesting stories? Found here as well. Aside some miniature stories buried in the game (which are highly entertaining if you take the time to follow them), the main story arch is captivating and culminates in a finale that will well before be initiated by yourself uttering 'Wait wait WAIT a moment ...'  Want good presentation? Eeeeeehh, you got me there. Hacknet is what it is, and as such it is relatively .. economical .. regarding its presentation. It has its moments though, and together with the - depending on the situation - driving and yet unobtrusive music you might be surprised in a positive way.  Over all, erm. Yeah listen. That's delicious. Fractal Alligator certainly found a new fan in me.

I'm probably being unnecissarily harsh, but I really was shocked at how repetative this game was.   It seemed like there were alot of mechanics that they planned, but never got around to implementing. All that hype about deleting the logs after you access a computer... maybe I missed something, but I couldn't see that it did anything. And the Trap and Forkbombs... were those actually useful somehow? Oh, and it was very easy to make game-breaking mistakes, like deleting a file you were supposed to steal. Alot of silent ways to ruin the game and be unable to recover... hope you didn't save after one of those.  There are alot of fun points. Getting a new script and seeing the new computers you can crack is exciting. The story in the beginning and end of the game are interesting. Also the little easter-eggs of emails and chat snippets were pretty funny. And I'm sure the game does look cool if you let people see you playing it.   My background in embedded sofware may have colored my opinion a bit, but the game felt awfully thin for $10. And from a gameplay perspective, it was awfully rough. Serious programmers should look at TIS-100 instead, although beware: Zacktronics games are not for the faint-hearted, and may feel a little too much like work to the professional programmer.",

I solved this by finding an IP of a server in my save file in order to get a program that I needed. The developer of the game has made it perfectly that they know of this bug and are working on it. You might want to wait off on this game until that's fixed, if such things bother you. The only downside to this game is a major flaw. The flaw being no rewards system at all for hacking. You can't earn money from missions to upgrade your machine or anything. All that exists is story progression. So if you care nothing about Bit and his story, this game will be extremely boring to you. So if you think you'll find the hacking repetative and you care nothing about Bit, I'd give this game a pass.  TL;DR Really fun game, but needs some work.

However, I'm quite sure that you will love every minute of it.  I'm not entirely sure how this game stacks up if you just want another Uplink (I haven't played that particular game), but there are other reviews that focus on that. What I can tell you is that this game is a stylish, sleek, and very impressive hacking simulator. The plot is woven very well into the game, and there are easter eggs and hidden things aplenty. I made it a point to look at every IRC archive on every computer I hacked, because I'd be laughing even while they traced my IP address.  The game's solution to everything is elegant and new; nothing feels like a tired concept. The game is just long enough to be as impressive as possible with all of its assets.  On the negative side, the slightly buggy nature of the game is where the indie nature really shows. My first playthrough went well enough until I was hit with a progression-ending bug that I didn't realize until I had actually made progress into a hidden sidequest. From then on, I was a little bit afraid to explore and screw around in case I got hit with another glitch. An option to load from saves wouldn't be amiss, but I'm sure people would use it to save-scum (and unfortunately miss one of Hacknet's coolest features:   attempting to forcibly reset your IP address just after a trace has reached your computer  , which adds to the game's tension).  Some objectives and game aspects are a little unclear, especially when worded in the game's cool cyber-security lingo (which actually adds to the charm to some extent). For instance, there's only a small sliver of documentation about a considerably-important yet optional feature: setting up proxies as 'traps' to be sprung if a trace is about to reach you, which overloads your computer but stops the trace from doing any lasting damage. Experimenting is rendered difficult due to the fear of bugs as above - again, some sort of feature to load a session might help.  However, above all, you will find that Hacknet is well worth your time and $10 (or $8 if you buy during this Steam sale), because - be honest with yourself - you're looking into Hacknet to feel like a Hollywood Hacker, and that's exactly what this game makes you feel like.",

Even if you aren't a hacker wizard (like myself), this game is really easy on guiding you in with tons of tutorials and hints and having easy buttons like TAB to fill out the programs and make it a bit more friendly to the average player.   The story is really really immersive and honestly along with the soundtrack is the best thing about the game. The creators really did a great job of making you feel like you are the actual hacker and you are the one that is under the control of all of this. Moving around and seeing all the ways the story builds up is suspenseful, well done, and overall kept me really going and a bit suspenseful at times. The soundtrack is also top notch by the way, which help to not only add to the immersion but really help tense up at suspenseful parts in the game and also really melodic when it needs to which is also a huge plus.  In the end, Hacknet is a brilliant hacking game with puzzle/mystery solving elements, a beautiful soundtrack, a wonderful story, and in overall a great game. I don't expect this to be for everyone because the terminal layout is all you're going to see and this game does a real job portraying you as a hacker so it can be a bit tricky at times, but in the end, it's something that I believe that you should try out if you're willing to tackle on the puzzles and mysteries, as this is definitely not a game for just the casual puzzle solver.

There are different ways to go through the game although there are some missions that you have to fulfill in order to progress, the side quests are also fun. In addition, the extra widgets (and mini-game) and the fact that you can change the colour of your UI are little details that make the game's fun increase.  The music is the one thing that I both liked and didn't like. While it fit the atmosphere when you're playing, it can get distracting at times (especially when a part of the mission is time-sensitive). Maybe if it was softer or you had the option to use your own tracks it would be better. There were also some bugs I encountered while playing causing me to restart the game twice. The first was an error wherein it told me thtat the mission I just completed wasn't finished and I couldn't progress through the game (as it was a main mission). The second one was a similar issue later on. A simple restart of the game fixed it and I didn't have any trouble with it afterwards.  The graphics are simple and easy on the eyes and so is the font although I wouldn't mind if it was a teensy bit bigger.   The gameplay is simple and after a while, the commands are easy to memorize. I enjoy the puzzle aspect of the game and there are different ways to play through. One challenge (and perhaps my next playthrough) would be playing the whole game simply in terminal mode to see if (1) it's possible, (2) how fast I can do it, and (3) how challenging it is.   Overall, I highly recommend this game to anyone interested in programming whether just beginning (as it helps teach focus, critical thinking, and memorization) or already pretty in deep (cause it's fun!). It's a great game and pretty cool to play around your friends.",

I'm a huge fan of hacking game and have been a loyal fan of Uplink and the subsequent iterations. This little gem is a wonderful addition to the genre.

All UI-related actions show up in the command prompt as if the prompt was used.  Mechanics aside, the storyline is engaging and even plausible. I love it! The end made me tear up a bit. While there may be some replayability if you weren't thorough on the first pass through, you won't be upset about obtaining this game as you'll come back to it down the road and be just as engaged as before.  Should you buy this game if you're a fan of hacker games? Yes. Should you buy this game if you're not a fan of hacker games? If this would be your first game into the genre, I fully recommend it.

Means you can do the missions/assignements/whatever you call them just to help out and progress with the story. You don't have to grind dozens of copy-pasted 'download file from a server' missions just to buy a software tool or a faster CPU.   The missions are usually pretty straightforward, although some could use more of a clear objective along the lines of 'reply to this email with the password to THAT server'. Some missions, though... Project Juno... Best. Mission. Ever. You start with an IP address, you go and poke and come up with a link or another IP address hidden in some memo, or even a password to something you can't hack and you basically explore the net and look for a solution while nobody knows if a solution exists (well, it does, since this is a game, but you get the idea). The final mission and dtory outcome feel a bit underwhelming, but all-in-all, very nice game of holywood hacking.  The only thing that sucks is the music. Not a fan of techno, but most hacker games seem to have it. Is this a thing? Like another stereotype of hacker = shy, socially awekward nerd with zits and dorky glasses, who listens to techno? Anyway, that doesn't drag the overall experience down. If you liked Uplink, get this. If you like hacker movies/games, get this. If you type like a toddler, go practice, then get this.",

After playing for 12 hours now, I can say that as a whole, it is really fun and I don't regret getting it. There have been a few problems that I have had with it so far so I am hoping that those can be fixed soon, most noteably the loss of my save game. It progresses rather nicely and before you know it you are breaking into the death row records and the medical database.  This does do a lot of things better than Uplink, but there are still some things I would have liked to see/ do in this game, like breaking into a bank. For me, it was really satisfying to break into a bank, steal all the account numbers and passwords, delete logs, steal all the money I wanted, then go buy some fancy new things. That being said, this game doesn't have any kind of money system and it seems like you are, hardware- wise, stuck with everything from the beginning ; you gather new programs by hacking into someone computers and finding them/ missions.   One of the missions broke or something so I had a decrypt program but for whatever reason couldn't complete the mission after decrypting the indicated file. However, I then hacked the email provider, traced some emails to a computer which I broke into, stole a program, got out, and had to get back in because I ran out of time to delete the logs.  I had to decrypt it, but I needed a password which was related to the 'best character from Final Fantasy X,' whose characters I had to look up because I knew none of them, and I finally decrypted/ decyphered it. The program was Clock.exe, and you know what? It was a clock.   In short, great game if you like these kinds of games.    TLDR:  Broke into a International Academic Database, quickly go to delete my logs, and accidentally delete the entirety of the academic records. 10/10 would ruin lives again.",

The biggest difference is that HN is much more command based than UL where, as far as I remember, most of the things could be done with a mouse. And about UL I honestly love all the references they put in the game, like the password 'rosebud' which, if I'm correct, was the one of the Uplink Server Test Machine!!! Gameplay-wise the game is pretty 'straightforward': you connect to a machine, you use the tools you have available to hack it. The best part is when you'll have to search for a password, 'cause in that case you'll have to use more of your brain instead of just launching this or that tool. After all I think that for the price it's an absolutely great great game!  PROs: Interesting story. Lovely UI and you can change the theme after a while in the game! Loved the missions where you actually had to find how to enter a system instead of simply using your tools.  CONs: The biggest letdown is that there's no upgrade system (like in UL where you could change your machine, CPU, etc.) and if you combine this with the fact that the missions don't seem randomly generated (again like in UL) you'll see that some people could not have enough motivations to replay the game... unless you're a maniac and want to check every single IRC Log or such stuff. :D Surely most of you could object that it wasn't that great in UL too, 'cause you just needed to find a nice bank, hack it and voilà you had everything upgraded. Fact is that from a point of view, all those little stuff (time running, new missions arriving, etc.) was useful to make you feel in a more active, and alive, world than HN and it wasn't that bad after all.  IT Hacknet è un gran gioco.  Vi è piaciuto Uplink? Bene allora dovrebbe piacervi pure questo gioco. La più grande differenza è che HN si basa molto di più sui comandi via console di UL dove, per quanto ricordi, la maggior parte delle cose potevano essere fatte col mouse. E riguardo UL ho onestamente apprezzato tutti i riferimenti che hanno inserito nel gioco, come la password 'rosebud' che, se ricordo correttamente, era quella dell'Uplink Server Test Machine!!! Riguardo al gameplay il gioco è abbastanza 'diretto': vi connettete ad una macchina, usate gli strumenti che avete a disposizione per hackerarla. La parte migliore è quando dovrete cercare una password, perché in quel caso dovrete usare più il vostro cervello che lanciare questo o quel strumento. Alla fine credo che per quel prezzo sia un gioco assolutamente grande!  PRO: Storia interessante. Simpatica interfaccia utente e potete pure cambiare tema dopo un po' avanti nel gioco! Ho apprezzato le missioni dove devi trovare come entrare in un sistema invece di usare semplicemente gli strumenti.  CONTRO: La maggior delusione è che non c'è un sistema di upgrade (come in UL dove potevate cambiare la vostra macchina, CPU, etc.) e se lo unite al fatto che le missioni non sembrano generate casualmente (nuovamente come in UL) vedrete che alcune persone potrebbero non avere abbastanza motivazioni per rigiocarlo... a meno di non essere un maniaco e di voler controllare ogni singolo log IRC o cose così. :D Certamente molti di voi potrebbero obbiettare che non fosse questa gran cosa nemmeno su UL, perché bastava trovare una buona banca, hackerarla e voilà avevate upgradato tutto. Il fatto è che da un punto di vista, tutte quelle piccole cose (il tempo che passava, nuove missioni che arrivavano, etc.) erano utili per farvi sentire in un mondo più attivo, e vivo, di HN e non era male dopo tutto.",

Let's go over the high points: Sound/Music - Amazing, fits the theme, shifts to fit the situation. Graphics - Visualizers are interesting and background art is cool. The text is a nice readable font. Story - Great main story with lots of sidequests. Events and plot devices are well executed. Gameplay/Control - Enter text commands or point/click, easy to navigate servers, help system built in for text commands. Price is VERY reasonable for the quality of this game.

It's now two hours later and the only reason I'm stopping is that I have to cook dinner.  It takes all the things I loved about Introversion's Uplink, and gets rid of the main issue I had with it. The routing through bundles of servers and having to remove your logs from each and every single server, each and every single time. So tedious it's unbelievable. You still have to remove logs in Hacknet, but thankfully it's a lot more straightforward. This game keeps all the fun parts, the espionage and the feeling of curiosity. There's plenty to read on all the servers, even a lot of flavour text not even related to the game.  Honestly, this is one of the best hacker games I've played, and if my profile is anything to go by, I own most of them available on Steam. It's nowhere near as unforgiving as Hacker Evolution, and nowhere near as tedious as Uplink can get in it's mid to late game.  I can't say too much more without going into spoiler territory, but there's a point about 30-45 minutes in that makes you go 'wow... what on earth do I do now?' - and you need to call on all the skills you've learned so far to get past it. The feeling of accomplishment when it works out is amazing.  These guys better be making this into a series like Hacker Evolution, because it has incredible potential, and I'm loving every second.",

The gameplay is nothing really exciting, it's more of a mechanical matter of using the appropriate tool for each situation (use the SSH cracker to crack open a SSH port, etc.). The only difficulty is when there is a countdown due to the user being 'traced', but even there it's not very challenging. Basically you have to learn to type the right commands, and fast.  The other aspect of gameplay is the investigation you have to lead, unfortunately most of the time there is a lot of handholding and making progress requires very little initiative on your part, just following the lead you're given and using the tools you have at your disposal. Also the main story is quite short, and I'm not feeling much motivation right now to try and find the alleged two other side stories (I completed the one with the pacemaker, which I found was the most gratifying storyline as the game gave you little indication).  (also I got hit by the 'main story blocked' bug but managed to unblock it by editing the save file as explained in a forum post)  Still I would like to thank the authors for the Linux port.

In my opinion if you loved Uplink you'll love this. It's a much more graphically rich game, just look at it!

Most of us are actually screwed when we forget the PIN for our smartphone. And thats ok. Nothing to feel bad for. But still....those classic hacker movies. And this Mr. Robot show. That looks so awesome. But are we interested in dedicating our freetime for our new and perhaps fleeting passion? Learn to program and hack and learn code and whatever. Books! Math! Boring stuff! Thank God there is Hacknet, a hacking sim reminiscent of the classic game Uplink. And in a good way!  Basically, you are a hacker and you follow a storyline and/or your own ideas and hack your way through files, computer systems, security and whatnot. And, like in real life, the protagonist (you!) sits in front of the computer and does all this incredible hacking stuff from his or her chair. And in a game like this, its about the small things it does: You can click on a computer to connect with it. Or you use command codes and an IP adress. You can look through files with clicking on a button. Or you use, you guessed it, command codes to look through it. The latter feels more authentic, and sometimes, thats what you want. Actually, in my humble opinion, this game is best when you try to use as many written commands as possible. It gives you the feeling to be a real hacker.   In many games, hacking is an afterthought. A minigame at best. Like in Deus Ex: Hacking belongs to Cyberpunk like awesome armblades, but it is basically connect-the-dots with a nicer color palette. And thats totally cool, cause you dont want to obstruct the core gameplay. But if you want to feel like a real hacker, disrupting the system chilling in a comfy chair, then look no further than Hacknet. Choose your nickname, learn a few basic commands that the game teaches you and discover your inner anarchist. The game gets more complicated along the way and you have to think a bit more, but thats what you want. Hacking the computer of a smalltown retirement home is one thing, but getting these corporations: Thats the holy grail of cyberpunk-esque hacking, isnt it?

To begin with I went into this game not expecting much from a text based game centred around a particularly boring practice, but it was a pleasant surprise.  - OST was fantastic, fit tense scenarios and was chill but still engaging when it needed to be.  - The story, wow the story, didn't expect to become attached to characters that you only ever make contact with through email.  - The gameplay, while when you step back and look at it it's pretty simple, it still keeps you engaged especially when you have to work against the clock to execute programs or if you have to really dig to find the information you're looking for. A puzzle game without feeling like a puzzle sometimes.   - Immersive UI style, not to mention reboots for themes and if you type in to open the CD tray it actually will on your pc. Just a really cool way of presenting the game.  - The parody of places like 4 c-h-a-n-s (it's censored on steam lol) technology board was really well done and other sites like CFC, the KFC counterpart really gave it a cool tie.  - Finally the easter eggs and extra depth to the game that you find if you just go a little further. Personal things from people and embarrasing company memos. Vandalising sites because you can, it's just plain fun and gives you extra to explore apart from the main story.   Overall, I highly recommend this game considering it's price and what is has to offer, one of the few games this year that really got to me.  10/10",

I can't really hit that thumbs down button because it's clear that a lot of work and love was put into this game, and the developer tried hard to get an immersive atmosphere of an actual computer terminal.

Pros: - Great music - Great visual effects - Runs at 60FPS almost consistently if your computer doesn't suck like mine - Amazing introduction to a genre that I was sort of lost in beforehand. - Difficulty spikes are usually your fault because you forgot the command 'porthack' somehow. (POINT AND LAUGH AT THE EXPECTED)  Cons: - If your computer does suck like mine, you'll have to turn down the resolution a bit and turn off scanlines and the great visuals at later parts in the game. - I got a bit lost, but it's likely my fault, so you should be fine. (CONTINUE TO POINT AND LAUGH AT THE EXPECTED)   Overall, I loved the game. I finished it in about 6 hours and left the game on as I ate dinner, which shows the 6.5 hours at the time of this review.

            "review_text": "General bugs: This game was moderately interesting, though buggy, for the first hour or so. The keyboard didn't always work, so I couldn't type commands at a rate I was used to. Every once in a while, the keyboard would completely break (you type in a few characters of a command, and the game backspaces them out). However, you could always save, quit the game, and restart to fix it (although the keyboard was always buggy). This was on Mac. I decided to switch to a Windows machine, and the keyboard worked perfectly.  Annoyances: Commands don't work like you'd think. Many of them are close to real commands (e.g. scp). However, you can't download a file to a different filename, like real scp. AFAICT, there is no way to create a directory. For someone who likes organization, being only able to put dozens of random files from different missions into one big directory (or move them into one of two subdirectories already created) was frustrating.  Game-breaking bug: Before I switched platforms, I hit a game-breaking bug on a certain mission where I had to decrypt a file. My research told me what the password should be, but the command didn't accept the password. The problem persisted on Windows once I switched. I spent hours trying to figure out my issue, but failed. I even did cryptanalysis and found the 'passcode' that was used in encryption, but that did me no good since you cannot type in a passcode. You must enter the password, which gets converted into the passcode. With the passcode, I could literally decrypt the file by hand, if only I had a text editor. A hacker without a text editor?  Ultimately, to my shame, I had to look in the forums, guides, etc. To my surprise, I found at least 3 different ways that other players solved this mission. One solved it without a password at all. Another used the password that I was trying all along. The third used a misspelling of the name (with a 'd' instead of a 't'), and for some reason it worked. None of those worked for me.  I have a feeling if I started a new game on Windows, the problem would go away, but I'm not sure if this game is interesting enough to start it all over again.  Review: The game is interesting, and there are plenty of fun tidbits, such as IRC logs with humorous situations. They are repetitive, but worth a laugh. I'm not sure why the executive at KFC spends time on IRC, but whatever. ;) The missions, though, are very repetitive. Hack these ports, download a file. Can't hack a port? Download some command to do it. There is no hacking so much as using tools. You are a script kiddie. I'm not sure I'd play it again, given the possibility of another game-breaking bug, but I was entertained before that happened (even with the other bugs).  Edit: I ended up restarting the game on Windows, and all of the bugs described above were fixed, including the game-ender. I ended up having fun, since I was able to get past the previously completed missions very quickly, and didn't need to nose around the IRC logs, etc. as much as the first play.",

The interface is very authentic. Especially if you use window managers rather than a full desktop environment. The requirement to use the terminal instead of clicking everything makes the game feel more like real world hacking. The Hacknet story line is more developed than other hacking simulators. There is a sense of freedom to pick diversified contracts and to complete them however fit. All of this supports casual game play.  Cons:  (More of a preference than a con.)  Breaking the security of a real world network devices requires time, caution, ability, and patience. People with InfoSec experience will feel like they are rolling their face on the keyboard.

This game is easy enough to get right into, but challenging enough to be interesting. There is a bit of necessary hand holding at the beggining (thank god for us clueless players) that helps teach you the ropes. Later on I've noticed your expected to do the same task over and over. The game does a great job of making this fun as you dig through personal files and enjoy quirky text documents and interactions with people your hacking. I hacked someone, delete a file, and he emails me calling me a 'Script Kiddie' and proceeds to try to hack me. I trap him using a Shell and feel accomplished.
