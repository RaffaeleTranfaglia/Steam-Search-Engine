It can happend that you spawn a second after someone else so you can kill him instandly, As I played the game this wasnt a point wich destroyed my game opinion but it isnt fair or good anyway. -the hitbox of the knife is terrible, in my 3 knife attemps i needed 5-7 hits to actuall hit the enemie  (anyway - you wont use the knife anyway) -maybe the price. I know 3€ isnt too mutch, but it feels like too mutch for this game. Get it at sale!   Thanks for reading - here's a knife, you wont hit somebody with, anyway:   ___________ __ |____ I._______.-'   (Sorry for my english)",

That's a good thing, right?  Graphics are low-res, it's very CPU intensive (So expect some hot hands if you're playing this on a two-year old laptop... But that would be a plus if it's winter though), animations... Don't get me started. Not with the sounds either... Don't get me started on anything.  But hey. If it's on sale for 0.05$, buy it!

Pros-  1.Chunky yet funky If you have played FPS like Assult cube then you probs know how the shooting feels, The graphics at high looks much more better compared to AC. but the character models arre something to work on, Ofcos not CSGO character like quality but atleast CSS type but its still amazing.   2. Kind of Rail shooter if playing Deathmatch  3. NO economy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, All weapons are free except few which can be unlocked in a mode.  4. Nice sound.  5. Realism environment.  6. Feels fresh.  Cons-  1. Glitches Oh my god, I character models which floats in the air like a ghost or something scares the ♥♥♥♥ outta me. But its no harm.  2. Character models yee. work on them  3. Only 3 maps while the 2 looks exactly same  4. ♥♥♥♥ing RPGs, Dont even think. The Bots runnin with RPGs to screw your ♥♥♥ up with one time hit.  5. No way to chat.  6. No players on servers. IDK.  But ignore all, Its really a cool game. And have hella potential to become best seller. ",
