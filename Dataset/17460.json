            "review_text": "Having sunk over 200 hours into this game alone, over 500 hours in total for this whole trilogy how can I not say this is one of the greatest adventures I've had ever in my life. This is not just a game that you play like call of duty just to pass the time, this series has become a religious experience, a lifestyle.  When I first loaded up this game I had no idea what I was in for, but it gave off a seriously special energy and I got sucked into a living, breathing universe...full of wonder, full of excitement and it shook me like Star Wars KOTOR never could (and is the reason why and how I even bought this game).   Don't even think is this game going to be good enough for my $20 (Australia), if you can afford it just buy it and open your heart, mind and soul to this amazing experience. Don't listen to the haters crying about there ME3 endings that they never got etc, its the journey, the friendships you create, the relationships you forge, the hearts you can break, the tears that can be shed. Don't miss out.  Love you Bioware, you have turned my world and my views, my inner essence, my personality upside down, inside out and blown it to hell and back (in a good way). You've made me mad, you've made me sad, made me happy, made me cry, made me scream the roof down. How many games can you get emotionally, psychologically and spiritually attached to.  Games are artwork like paintings and music for this technological generation, this game is a work of art. AAA+",

            "review_text": "Mass Effect games are always fun to talk about, never sure if I love or hate them more.  The 1st game in the series undoubtedly plays most like an RPG of the 3 games, though even then, it would stand as a rather odd RPG when compared to others.   For those that have played BioWare's best work: Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic, you'll notice some similar sub-stories, characters, and styles. I mention this only because the influence is strongest in the 1st game, when the series hasn't really defined itself completely.  Anyways, it stands as the black sheep of the trilogy for its odd mix of RPG and 3rd person shooter mechanics. It does, however, possess strengths the others lack. The Lovecraftian horror influence is pretty clear in some of the side quests that take you to remote planets -- the fear of the unknown, the ominous music all play into this.   The vehicular sections on the remote planets are a bit clunky, but they do a good job of establishing mystery -- you don't know quite what you're going to find. This works well in both reinforcing the trilogy's whole narrative and the general style the narrative embodies: the unknown, powerful threat, the dirty/dark sci-fi.  Of course, one has to forgive the incessantly repeated interiors and textures for the side quests, this game lacks polish. If one can get past it, one will find a series of stories that help add to and fill in Mass Effect's universe, even setting things up for the sequels well.  If one does everything, the game will take roughly 45-50 hours. If one moves through the narrative alone, you can complete it in 10-15 hours.   The main story narrative has the strongest KOTOR infuence. KOTOR was a campaign across a series of planets, not an entire galaxy. Mass Effect too, is composed of fairly long missions on a small handful of planets -- each a sort of individual story that connects to the larger narrative. Or there's the fact that in both KOTOR and ME1, the player follows the antagonist, or rather retraces their steps, to discover their motivations and goals, across different planets.   This is contrasted, then, with Mass Effect 2 and 3, where the meat of the games is composed of much more compact and exposition heavy missions with a lot of tight, polished shooting across many locations.  The shooting mechanics seem to, in principle, be based on what many call a Gears of War or GTAIV cover based system. Player pops in and out of cover. However, it's pretty clunky, the player doesn't stick too well to cover and cannot navigate it very well.   Add in the fact that weapons, armor, and upgrades are doled out in a traditional RPG manner, with damage stats being compared, unique drops, the skill point based system of character leveling. and a huge inventory to sort through, and one will begin to notice that things seem out of place.   It is not so much that these elements are bad in and of themselves, but more that they don't belong together. As if the developers were unsure of what kind of game they wanted Mass Effect to be.  After several replays, I've come to realize that they don't do a very good job of leading up to what is supposed to be the central twist of the narrative, the big reveal about the focus of the whole trilogy, the thing to make the games all connect. Avoiding spoilers, I mean the event with the 'virtual intelligence' on Virmire late in the game.   Anyone replaying will notice that the game will go so far as to basically tell, through other characters, the player directly what the narrative reveals later in a manner obviously meant to be climactic. It is again, odd, unpolished, and atypical of BioWare, much like the entirety of the game.  **SPOILERS AHEAD**  Besides feeling out of place and sometimes unpolished, the game has a lot of content, has mechanics that work even if feeling awkward, and manages to present an engaging narrative -- I still get rather excited when Joker commands the fleet upon Sovereign in one of the final scenes. Mass Effect's cinematic presentation is fantastic and never fails to make me feel invested in the story.   (If, again, one can forgive some of the cliches like checking the body of the villain to make sure he's dead only to discover him alive or thinking the hero is dead only to have him reemerge triumphantly. I think it is possible to view these little storytelling sins sympathetically, cute little mistakes of young Mass Effect)  I spent around 150 hours (100 on my Steam copy) on this game over several playthroughs. As I said at the beginning, I have a lot of issues with the series and it definitely isn't perfect. I can't deny though, that they do some things so well, and are so unique that they are games we can conclude are worth playing, worth discussing, worth evaluating.  Despite the game's flaws, odd qualities, and weird inability to define itself, I have to recommend it for all it does well, for starting a great trilogy and for leading into the best game of the series: Mass Effect 2.",

You fall in love with the characters around you and really feel like you are fighting for a true cause. I loved this game so much, it's now higher than the Bioshock series (which was my all time favorite). I've never cried so much when a character left or I made the wrong choice. Mass Effect 3's ending absolutely destroyed me. I completed it only a day ago and I still feel really depressed over it. In general though, this game is an extraordinary masterpiece. The character development, the choices, the gameplay and the story are just so amazing. I loved every minute of this game franchise and I recommend this to everyone. I really felt like I was Commander Shepard. I felt like I was making a difference. I felt like I was saving the world. I really felt like everything I did, everywhere I went, that people, no the WORLD was depending on me and the choices I made. I've never felt so much for a video game in a long time. 10/10 Broke my heart, made me fall in love and made me happy when I made the right choices.  Thank you Bioware.

            "review_text": "This game really did it for me. While not flawless the gameplay experience it gave me was among the best I have yet to encounter in my gaming 'career'. Apart from my first playthrough of Final Fantasy 7 and, of course, Mass Effect 2 nothing comes to my mind that holds up in comparison.  The premise does not seem that extraordinary at first glance. You play as Commander Shepard (either male or female, your choice) and basically you are going to prevent the annihilation of every major civilisation in the galaxy. Pretty standard so far. But the world building in this game is so complex, so detailled it blew me away. Every now and then you get entries in your Codex where you can read about the many spacefaring races, some important historic events or the different technologies you are utilizing in the game. I loved how they put that much effort into something many gamers won't even bother to read because it is not important at all if you just want to progress the story.  What really makes the game come to life is its host of memorable characters. There are innumerable people you encounter, many of which can be spoken with, often offering multiple dialogue-tree options. Some of those will join your team and become your companions. Since I engaged all of my companions in conversations regularly between missions I started to really care about them. They are fully fleshed out personalities, each with his own motivations and wishes. The main villains, the Reapers, are mostly only hinted at. But you never forget them and their looming presence in the background gives the story a dire urgency. The Reapers' henchmen you are battling are nothing grand but they serve their purpose well.  The gameplay combines elements of roleplaying, shooter and exploration games and the result gave me great joy. There were some rather unpleasant moments while traversing the surface of the more mountainous planets but thankfully there weren't that many of them. The majority of the game is spent either engaging NPCs in conversations or shooting at enemies. Both aspects are done very well, although the shooter portion got a tiny bit repetitive at the end. But since I did every available sidequest and played almost nonstop for several days until I was done that might be my own fault.  The skillsystem is solid and you get tons of loot to equip your characters with.  There are several occasions when you have to make a decision that will have repercussions in the later games. Some are more personal and affect if a specific character will survive to come back in the sequels. Some have a galactic impact. In one case you decide between exterminating an entire race or giving them another chance. All of these moments came back to me vividly while playing Mass Effect 2 and being confronted with the consequences of my own actions.",

I met my first Volus along the way. I learned what a Specter was and what was expected of me when I became one. And the conversations. I love the conversations.

The rpg elements are ok-ish and the combat's not polished compared to newer games, but the shooting is serviceable, not absolutely horrible. Just not up to today's standards I'd say.  It's more star trek than any star trek game, because you get to be captain of a ship, make decisions that impact storylines and your relationship with your crew, pursue romantic interests, and explore plenty of planets (though admittedly they are sometimes kinda empty and the buildings are reused very often). And if you really like lore and backstories in your games, this game has plenty and a lot of them are fully voiced. What mass effect really does well is immersing you into its world.  Would definitely recommend this game to anyone even remotely interested in sci fi.",

The story is deceptively simple. You are Commander Shephard and you must save the galaxy. As you complete the simple story you will have to make decisions that will flesh out the story and in some ways decide on who lives and who dies. Apart from the main story, there are numerous side missions that help develop relationships with fellow characters or influence what happens in the sequels. There is tons of replay value due to the fact that there are different ways to handle various situations in the game. The graphics have aged well, I think. The characters are all memorable. You won't like these characters, you will LOVE them. The relationships you build (or tear down) will follow you in the games to come. Now for the negatives, and I had to squint to see them. I personally found the exploration tedious. The planets you go to are all very detailed, with descriptions about their resources and history, but driving the vehicle to go through some of the rough terrain got to be annoying at times.

The loot system has been 'simplified' to a point where you keep getting the same items over and over again. You can modify weapons and ammo though.  The story is okay, but it didn't really catch me. Maybe the quite obvious build up for the main character to become the saviour of the universe was a bit too much. The voice acting for the main character does its part by simply being not good.  You can travel to other systems than the ones covered by the main story, but they are boring and at best filled with some generic structures without any deeper meaning. You explore those planets using a vehicle that has one of the worst controls and physics I've ever encountered in a computer game.  The visuals are good for a game from 2008, but the music doesn't really work for the title. It's very bland electronic music that would rather fit in an elevator.  I won't finish the game even if I invested over 16 hours into it so far as I don't see it becoming really interesting and the overall gameplay is just not satisfying. Why I still give it a thumbs up? I still think it's worth a try even if I personally don't like it.",

I will say one thing for the first Mass Effect thats annoying is the glitch in the snow biome quest when all the characters and enemies become pixilated black so its hard to try to kill them but I managed to get through it twice and it goes away once youre out of that mission. They never fixed that glitch though. -sigh- Oh well, still a great game!!! ^-^",

            "review_text": "I actually spent 20 hours in this game in the last 4 days in Steam offline mode, so ignore Steam playtime.  Mass Effect was a pleasant surprise for me, because of two reasons: I'm not a fan of space opera and sci-fi, and I couldn't get into one of Bioware's well known title - Dragon Age: Origins. But screw them, let's talk about Mass Effect. The game has messy inventory system, clunky animations, pretty straightforward weapon upgrades and doesn't allow progressing after finishing the main story, aaaaaaand... that's it, that's all my criticism for ME. What can I say more about it? Mass Effect is a well-crafted game from head to toe, with nearly all aspects perfected.  First, I freaking love the narrative. In the first 30 minutes, I thought it was some typical pretentious sci-fi piece of ♥♥♥♥ that overcomplicates everything, but nope, the story really hooked me in, even it was just a standard good-vs-evil story filled with cliches. I can't tell exactly what I love about ME's story, but it gave me a sense of real progression, and pushed me forward through each events in the game. Sometime intense, sometime emotional and sometime even silly (especially in romance subplots), and of course it doesn't lack 'epicness' for a sci-fi saga.  Next, the dialogues. There's no such thing as illusive choices. In ME, every choice matters, and not all decisions lead to a good end.    I still feel bad because I accidentally shot Wrax on Virmire, had to replay that section  . Tip: Spend your points in Charisma or Intimidate, they're very important, don't ignore them.  Teammates. Uhuh, this is not your standard companions, your squad mates are TRUE human (or alien) beings with their own unique personality. You know what? I found it more interesting to wandering around the Normandy, talking to my squad mates, rather than exploring the galaxy. And I've never, ever, felt so much difficult in deciding between 2 squad mates' fates. There was no game that made me care so much about my team mates like Mass Effect. Why? Because ♥♥♥♥ you Bioware, you created some of the most memorable and well-developed side characters in any game I've ever played. If I don't see Garrus, Wrex, Liara or Tali in the sequels, many tables will be flipped.  Gunplay hasn't aged well, but it's certainly enjoyable. Tons of weapons, upgrades and special biotic abilities. You don't need to be a strategist to play the game, but it certainly helps if you can order your squad mates to assist you on the battlefield.  Aargh. why, why did I spend the last 7 years without giving a damn about Mass Effect? Why didn't I know about it sooner? Why did I pass on this masterpiece? And why does Garrus's face look low-textured? Anyway, Mass Effect, 10 ♥♥♥♥ing out of 10, heavily recommended. If you are a fan of RPG or sci-fi, play it already. If you don't give a crap about RPG or sci-fi, then still give it a try, because you might like it as much as I do.",

It's a bit rough around the edges, but does not disappoint despite its age.  +It's an epic space adventure, in which you save the galaxy! +Did the above sound awfully generic? Well, I was surprised at the effort they put into creating a whole new universe with numerous alien races and technologies. They even put this optional but very cool information in a codex whenever you interact with objects or people. +A diverse cast of crew members with cool backstories, They even talk to each other when you ride the elevator (and thank gods for that)! +Combat is generally fun. Mostly with guns, as well as whatever technological or biotic (mass manipulating) skills you decide to learn. You can also pause at any time to give orders to your party members. +The 'morality' tree isn't clear-cut good/evil, but renegade/paragon. So your lawful actions don't cancel out your chaotic ones, or vice versa. Instead each contributes to their own separate bar, which enables more dialogue options in the future should you invest the skill points. +For the most part, you're free to do missions (both the main story and side missions) in any order you choose, flying around on your awesome spaceship  -The character movement can be clumsy. I've gotten killed more than once when Shepard decides he can 'take cover' behind a tiny piece of debris. -Vehicular controls are extremely clumsy. ♥♥♥♥ driving on hilly terrain, especially. -Side missions can be pretty repetitive after a while, especially since ~70% of them involve driving around planets that are reskinned versions of each other to get to buildings whose layouts are also copies of each other. -Inventory size limit is not a huge problem, but still a hassle. Why did they bother? -What the other reviewers said about elevators is true. There's too many of them and take too freakin' long!",

            "review_text": "Pros: -Story. This isn't surprising. Bioware games tend to be very plot-heavy and less centered on action. More talky-talky bits and extreme decision making. Less shooty-killy. The downside is that while you get a good chunk of the story in the beginning, it doesn't really pick up fully until over halfway through the game. Don't get me wrong. When it picks up, it really picks you up and throws you over the table and repeatedly screws you.  -Decisions. Like in Dragon Age, the choices you make do effect the rest of the gameplay and subsequent events. Impacting in the next two games for the trilogy, though I've yet to play 'em.  -Action. My first rpg shooter. I like that it wasn't so centered on kill-kill-kill. It allowed me time to get into it, and I'm not big on shooters. This doesn't feel like it's utterly in my face. It's third-person shooter, so I think that helps.  -Controls. Very easy to get used to.  -Gameplay. Very few timed events.    Cons:  -Controls. Yes, this is a pro, but in a few cases, it's a con. And it's only a con when you're in a vehicle called the Mako. Mass Effect was a game designed for the console, not the PC. And it shows. Holy hell, does it show. My driving is akin to a drunkard on speed. I managed to flip the damn car over when gravity was on MY side. Every death I suffered was due to that damn car. And you need to use that car a lot. It kills a lot of the fun within the game. Thankfully, it's not essential to the overall game, and if you're not a completionist, you won't have to use it that often.  -The 'lockpicking'. It took me forever to figure out wtf I was supposed to do. The game offers you no direction on that. And in decrypting something, the codes are a bit iffy as opposed to how it is for the xbox or PS3. It's a pain in the ♥♥♥. Once you learn what the hell to do, it's pretty simple. But until you figure it out, it's just banging your head against the wall.  -Characters need more by way of development. What was there was definitely touching, and I'm in NO way saying that these characters aren't awesome in their own right. I was touched by a few of their stories. But perhaps I'm spoiled by DA, and Bioware is pretty known for their character development, interactions, etc.   -Romances. One male romance for a female main character. One female romance for a male main character. And one female romance for either gender main character.  Though I'll give it points for having the bisexual love interest be an alien.   Awesome points:  -The aliens. Lots of variations, and I really like 'em all. Humans are pretty much on the lower rung here. There are prejudices, other alien races don't much care for humans and humans are the minorities. There's a small group of humans that are all Human Pride sort of thing, but they're largely irrelevant.  -The Reapers. I don't want to give any spoilers here, but these are seriously such a badass group of villains. The game made them genuinely scary.  -The planets. This probably won't mean much to those who don't care about lore or anything like that, but I found the short summarizations on the different planets to be pretty damn cool and innovative.    The Ugly:  -The profiles. You cannot make a pretty male Shepherd or a pretty female Shepherd. The textures, lights, shadows, angles will make even the most meticulously done Shepherd fugly. It's highly annoying.  -This is one of those games in which it's hard to figure out the first time you play it. Not controls-wise, but everything else-wise. Where to go, what to see, etc. Largely because this world is so big. It's a solar system and it FEELS like a solar system. However, once you've completed one playthrough, you won't really need a guide anymore. It helps that it's a pretty short game. It could probably be played through in the course of a weekend.",

Throughout the exploration and firefights, you will surely become attached to certain characters, so decisions you'll have to make later will put you in a cold sweat. Shooting mechanics in this game are solid, but sometimes feel lacking.

Want to be a soldier with all the toys of destruction or a full biotic with limited weapons, or a technician. You can play a character as these types and some in between.  One of the greatest things about the Mass Effect trilogy is that you can import a completed game character into the next installment of the franchise and get bonuses for completing the last installment and pick your character up where you left off. You of course can always just start a new character as well, but it is the carryover of the character that makes the series really unique.  The only strikes against it is some of the tedium related to exploring planets and inventory wrangling.  Definitely a must buy. ",

Shame that Bioware ended up in EA's bed, because what could have followed this game could have been 10x better than what got produced.  If you're wondering why this game is better? Play it. I'll give you some hints  1. It's actually an RPG - Something Bioware forgot in its sequels is giving the player choices that actually matter, in this you can truly feel like you're choosing your own path rather than having it forced on you  2. The Reapers - At this point, we didn't know much about the reapers, but that's why they were such a great plot point: because they were mysterious. Perhaps it would have been better that way, keeping the player in the dark about them while fighting them. Mass Effect 2 kind of lost the feeling that the Reapers generated and by Mass Effect 3 they pretty much took a back seat the ♥♥♥♥ing Cerberus  3. It gives you a villain to rally around - We all hated Saren, not because he was a bad character but because he was a bad guy, and he did that so well. Harbinger just assumed control of people, we had very little interaction with him.   4. Feels like an actual epic sci fi - What the sequels tried to do and failed is to keep the story epic while making it also feel like a summer thriller... bad move. Mass Effect throws environments at you that are really alien, combined with its freaky techno music that haunts you to the core. Sure, you often get the generic mountain planets, but I think they managed to make it work somewhat, and on that note  5. Exploration - I get it, this isn't the U.S.S. Enterprise, you're hunting a criminal, but that doesn't mean you can't have a look around while you're out and about. You get to read up on strange planets, (the galaxy map usage in this is better too), explore them in a hilariously buggy tank, and do whatever you want. They are empty, for the most part, but it still feels fun. ME2 kind of continued it, but the lack of vehicular exploratation (sans the hammer) really didn't give the same vibe. Don't get me started on resource hunting in ME3  There's a bunch of other stuff I didn't touch on. Is it perfect? Hell no, it definitely has flaws, but I rather would have seen them get fixed instead of axed in the second game. It's really quite sad.  ♥♥♥♥ you EA",

Perhaps my favorite part of Mass Effect, and the only part I feel was up to Bioware's usual quality, was the backstory of the universe the game is set it. Very high quality.  Overall this is a mediocre game to me. A game that tries to deliver an 'experience' but fails.",

            "review_text": "Combat I know this is the first one and they were getting some ground, but this is the weakest of the mass effect series. The combat is quirky and annoying where if you get close to a wall you automatically get suction cupped onto it, and you have to waddle your way out. It would have just been easier to have a cover button. Meanwhile shooting, it's okay but your kinda op even with the normal guns, heck you could speed run without leaving starting weapons/armor. 4/10  Dialogue/Characters Now this is the main reason I was interested in the games. The dialogue is very interesting and the story is very cool (especially the last battle) and you will stay immersed the entire time, until combat. The characters you find are cool and you will actually get a connection, they put more time into dialogue and characters rather than combat and it payed off, there isn't very much fighting and more talking which is great. The decisions you make actually hurt you and when you    get one of them killed you will feel like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for leaving them to die   . 9/10  Enviroments They put a lot of detail into the landscape and it is nice, I am not fond of using the rover though it feels clunky. I don't have much to say for this one though. 7/10  Final Verdict The game is alright and I can understand them not putting too much effort into it, they didn't know how good it would be. But the Dialogue is great and the story holds up. They did fix the Combat in Mass Effect 2 which is fantastic. Mass Effect 1 = 7/10 Not great but need to play if you want to get settled into the universe. Though one last comment for those who played Mass Effect 2/3 what the heck happened to Ashley? She get plastic surgery and a spray tan or something?",

In terms of being true the Sci-Fi theme its' pretty good, there's a lot of walking and waiting in elevators with stupid minigames clicking on planets. That's probably going to be our future, being in elevators, walking, and playig planet clicker on our I-phone 32s.  I have heard about complaints with the combat but I find most of them aren't valid. Whevenever I can't aim I just pause time by opening my inventory and move my crosshair to the enmey and then shoot. This makes combat pretty easy and is also very futuristic, having the power to stop time and aim my shots is some real ♥♥♥ sci-fi ♥♥♥♥.  Player choices feel like they matter, when I have the ability to role play as a racist in the future my ability to self-insert is enhanced, I feel completely immersed. Of course when the alien is hot I'm gonna pick her up despite her being a filthy ♥♥♥♥ing alien mongrel cuz you know ♥♥♥ and ♥♥♥♥ are a univeral language. The narrative is shaped by your attitude and decisions, but its kinda of narrow minded, you're either a do-goody ♥♥♥♥♥♥ boy scout who probably sucked his Scoutmaster off in the boy scouts or a crooked cop who's proving he can fit in with edgy teenages at the mall.  Personal complaints: the character animation is pretty stiff, but that might be a nod to how uncomfortable future clothes are going to be. I was dissapointed in the way you recruit members for your ship, you usually just talk to them which is traditional in RPGs but I would like to have seen it done Shounen Anime style where I fight him at first because they are my enemy but after getting past our differences we join together and have fun not contributing towards the plot during filler (there is a lot of filler missions in this game that dont' impact the plot at all oh my god this game is so close to a shounen anime).

The enemy AI uses cover effectively and uses tactics to manuver and flank when possible. This is not a rush and kill everything in sight game. Use your squad commands and utiilze cover or you will be anihilated. As commander you can take any path you choose in the game. If you want to be a saint or a sinner its up to you. Try as I might I cannot find a flaw in the game series. I've played then for hundreds of hours and I still enjoy them. About the only thing i can complain about is the secondary mission objective list in the third installment does not work well. There is no way to tell if you completed the mission or not and sometime no way to know where you need to go back to to complete it. So take lots of notes. Other than that this is the best series I have ever played and I cry at night knowing there will be no more. I guess 3 is the magic number.",

With this said, before I write a formal review on this game, I must say this: Mass Effect is an EXCELLENT game, however, if you cannot or do not want to play with these issues, you should not buy this game, or buy it on a console, I know for a fact the Xbox 360 version has no issues at all. If you can play with these issues, you will have a phenomemal time.

Pros:  + Fantastic story and writing that truly drags you in and doesn't let go + Wide array of characters, and they are all deep and interesting + Incredible voice acting, with people like Seth Green and Keith Davis having voices + Loads of different ways to play, different builds and squads to pick, and a deep upgrade and weapon system + Massive amounts of replayability + Huge world with tonnes of optional quests + Music fits well with the theme, and is well made + Quite long. I clocked in at around 15 hours, but I didn't do alot of the side quests. With all the optional content, I would say the game is about 25-30 hours long  Cons:  - The game has a little bit too much customizability, if you can understand that. It can literally take minutes to change all the gear and equipment, and it should have been simplified just a little bit to make it snappier and more enjoyable. It's not that it's hard to understand, you just waste a lot of time on it - Dialog options are sometimes not entirely clear on what you character will actually say, in what tone he will say it in, if he's being sarcastic ETC. Can lead to some unintentional speech that can affect your relationships on the Normandy  - Optimization is a little wonky, and you can expect some sudden frame drops here and there  Overall rating: 8.5/10 A must play for RPG fans!

It got recommended a lot, so I bought it in summersale to finally get my hads on the legendary saga.  Short review: I am not really into heavy roleplaying. Dialogue/Running around/Fighting felt about 50/40/10. Played on veteran (highest possible difficulty on 1st playthrough) and didn't feel challenged by any fight. Game is as old as it is so a lot of gameplay mechanics felt outdated. Story is okay, characters well-written. Beware of elevators and lightning bugs.  For everyone stil reading on: Welcome to the longer abstract on 'Elevator Simulator Effect 1'. (You really spend a long time in elevators in this game so excuse the joke)  Mass Effect is a game that recieved a lot of recommendations so i finally got around to try it out and play it through. I can't say that I would recommend it. The game is quite old and i don't feel that it aged well. Slight shader-bugs where my party turned into black blobs were quite offputting aswell (didn't happen too often fortunately and could be fixed with some console-tempering).  I understand that Mass Effect is mostly a storydriven game and storywise it felt slightly better than average. It didn't really catch me. You can blame that on me not being the type of player who enjoys standing around for 15 minutes and listening to dialogue. I relied heavily on reading subtitles as fast as i can and getting back into action.  Speaking of action: Fights make about 10% or less of the gameplay. The fight system felt clunky, party management outside of 'go there and fire away' wasn't really needed. There were occasions where i got oneshot by me being a dunce and stepping into enemy rockets but aside of that, combat didn't feel challenging or tactical at all. I mostly let my party hack enemies and make them float through the air while shooting them with pistols (heatsink upgrades for unlimited bulletstorm). Maybe Liara and Talia are op, but the last fight was over in about 15-20 seconds without me really doing anything (some bug prevented me from firing my guns there).   I played on veteran and understand that there are higher difficulties available on 2nd playthrough. I don't see the point in that. Why not enable them upfront?  Side Missions feel mostly like chores. Planets and structures on it get repetitive really quickly and pay out well. Stores barely have anything worth to buy so i was walking around with 999 omnigel and 9999999 credits during the two/three final missions.  Main Missions are interesting and Character development is a plus. The dialogues were all around well written.  I think i would have enjoyed the game more if it cut all the walking around, fighting and boring riding-around-in-your-gummyball-vehicle-on-planet-surfaces sequences (i despise this vehicle after using it that much). As it is, the gameplay feels too old and drags down the overall enjoyment of the game too much.  EDIT: corrected some spelling mistakes//2016-07-04",

Sure the story seems alright, maybe it's worth watching a youtube video of the story perhaps, but going through the levels, exploring the 'worlds' which consist complete sh*t and nothingness whilst piloting that horrendous vehicle.   The game has not aged well in my opinion, even with texture upgrades etc. The decision making is cool, but you know what's cooler? Witcher 3. I like the idea of the game, sure, but only running short distances before getting fatigued (you're a fkn marine, aren't you? how did Shepherd get through basic training at this level of fitness), You can't even sprint out of combat, you're stuck doing this crappy fairy jog.  Parts of the game and the environments seem cool, most are wide open voids of nothingness determined to take your soul should you stare into the abyss for too long.

The soldier and tech classes work well, but since you absolutely need the guns, I think the pure biotic class is a bit weak. You can't select an alignment, and you can only choose to be the nice guy or the badass in your speech options. It still gives you some options to go for when talking to people. There are two possible skills to improve that widen your speech possibilities which I found quite crucial. Most of the time it affects rewards only, but sometimes you can unlock additional storylines too.  The combat system is fairly simple. You have a choice of 4 weapons, however most classes are trained in one or two of those, and your combat effectiveness depends on this heavily. You can unlock extra abilities by improving your skills. These are available during combat and some of them are very useful, however some are available under different names but do the same thing. The cover system is a bit clunky but you can learn the way it works after some time.  Overall I have enjoyed this game a lot and I recommend it to sci-fi and rpg fans alike.",

The later games take a bit away from you, but here you almost always have a choice between being a jerk or a saint (You'll get this reference if you play the game) in every situation.  There are some mundane things though. You control a vehicle for most of the side missions called 'The Mako', and I really do not like this thing. It's definitely not designed for PC controls like the keyboard. And the planets you drive it around on very often have idiotic terrain designs so you will get very frustrated when trying to go anywhere.  Also, the side missions can get very repetetive, with reuse of the same buildings and layouts. The variation of the enemy battle lines aren't much either, you'll hear someone shout 'I will destroy you!' a lot.

            "review_text": "The Mass Effect series is one of my all-time favorites, followed closely by the Witcher. I have played at least 6 campaigns since I first bought the game several years ago.  Mass Effect is one of the best story- and choice-driven RPG games I've played since Baldur's Gate. It's a space opera with an incredible plot and amazing choice mechanics--your decisions matter in the long term and will determine both the consequences of this game and of Mass Effect 2 and 3--and it has aged very well as a result.  Character development is, in my opinion, second-to-none. The NPCs in your crew--and even some who aren't in your crew--have interesting relationships with Shepard, interesting backstories, and (despite the letdown of the Mass Effect 3 ending) fantastic character arc conclusions, which are even better if you get Mass Effect 3's Citadel DLC. The game universe is enormous and complex, and the story really gives you a good sense of how large it is as you fight your way through planets to complete missions.   There are three downsides:   1) The combat mechanics are rather boring. It's a third-person shooter that uses cover mechanics and not much else. You don't have ammo problems--your weapons will just overheat (which changes for the better, in my opinion, in the second game). You can't dodge and it's generally unwise to charge at the enemy on the higher difficulties, regardless of your character class, so you really just end up feeling like a massive brick wall with a gun. If you're going to attempt insanity, it's almost not worth it to play anything but the soldier class because it synergizes best with the game mechanics and can naturally regenerate health. However, I think the issues with the combat mechanics are more than compensated for by the quality of the story.  2) On a related note, the insanity difficulty is hard, but for bad reasons. It basically just amps up the health that enemies have by a lot and their damage by a little, making most battles drawn-out wars of attrition. If you're new, which I can't imagine is likely at this point, or coming from ME 2/3, I'd suggest you just play it on easy. Nobody's going to judge you. The point of the game is its storyline, in any case, and easy/normal are best for experiencing it without becoming frustated by large numbers of drawn-out battles.  3) After ME1, the combat mechanics improve exponentially, but the quality of the storyline declines. Compared to ME1, ME2 and 3 feel somewhat cheap. They're still worth it, and their stories are not by any means bad, but they are outshone by ME1 by quite a lot. The ending of the third game, particularly--even after the free DLC that EA put out to try to fix its problems--*will* leave you feeling cheated. The Citadel DLC will soften the blow considerably, though, so you should definitely get it, at the least. Aside from the beginning and ending of ME3, the storyline is solid and the major secondary plot points opened in ME1 and 2 are actually resolved very well.",

A lot of cliche references were borrewed from other science fiction elements in games/books/movies. * My expectations were a lot higher than what was experienced, but still enjoyed it immenesly. Perhaps I was a little unfair in my unrealistic expectations of the game. * At times the gameplay/mechanics and storyline can appear a little shallow. * At times the gamplay/mechanics can seem overly tedious or repetiive with no apparent reason to be. * Cannot jump! Grr - that annoyed me. Especially with all the running around I seemed to do everywhere it would ease the pain even a little.   Pros  * Awesome back story and world lore. * Great visuals/audio and environment. * Great storyline and progression. * Excellent soundtrack that did not annoy even throughout the entire play through * Added to my very short candidates list of games that 'I will play again' even after completion.   Conclusion  Storyline was slightly predictable but original in execution and the originality of core storyline elements were distinguished enough to surpass the predictability. Overall, this was a fantastic game and I enjoyed it thoroughly, however I did feel at times some of the gameplay seemed overly tedious and repetitive (eg: navigating through the ship) and a little shallow.  BUT I can't say enough good things about it and in fact struggling to fault it at all. If you like sci-fi genre as much as I do, this is a definite 'must play' - there is no question about it.",

The galaxy and the aliens just seem real and believable, helping to suck you into its world.   Admittedly I haven't played Mass Effect since playing 2 and 3, and I am sure there are many aspects of the gameplay that would annoy me if I were to play it again.

I had fun with the main quest missions, at least. The sidequests, however, (and especially the maps) are extremely repetitive and menial.   In the end, what makes this game worth the time is the story, characters, and the effect your decisions have on the final outcome. It's very possible to have multiple replays of this game.

While the basic plot is a simple military sci-fi, it is the smooth integration of player choice, characters, and gameplay that make Mass Effect special. The plot follows Commander Shepard, a human commando, and his journey through the galaxy as he tries to catch a rogue agent bent on the destruction of humanity and the aliens that live within the Milky Way. The defining attribute of Mass Effect is the seamless player choice that is present throughout the story. The player is given moral choices that affect the characters and situations that occur in the game. Between being the Paragon of virtuous moral code and the renegade commander hell bent on completing the job no matter what the cost, every situation can be approached with the player's own choice.   This ties in very well with the character development, something that not many other studios other than Bioware are proficient at. The crew of the Normady becomes populated with not just human soldiers and crewmen, but also engineers and scientists from alien races. The relationships and interactions with each character are unique and provide deep character development. This is the highlight of the experience, and the space opera setting only makes this a more immersive and spectacular experience. By far, Mass Effect is the best game in the Mass Effect Trilogy, every time I start a new save, the opening cutscene always manages to evoke the same excitement that creates a truly epic introduction to the game. Unmarred by the mistakes made with ME3, and providing a deeper and larger story and plot than ME2, Mass Effect, providing the mystery and excitement of discovering the story and setting, good character development, a satisfying conclusion, and a plethora of unique environments, is well worth my thumbs up.  10/10 did play again, many times.",

It's easy to get immersed into this game and spend a ton of time, in no small part thanks to the variery of things you can do.  It definitely has the worst combat system in the franchise - shooting and moving about just feels awkward and clunky at times. However, the fact that you have two squad memebers with different, cool abilities helps spice it up a lot, and adds a whole new element to the combat and stops it from getting stale.

A vast improvement over the console version (which I've had since day 1 and have clocked up hundreds of hours of play across 20+ playthroughs), the shooting mechanics are unchanged but combat feels MUCH smoother and the hacking minigame is so much better than the 'tap A/B/X/Y' system. As is common with pre-ME2 Bioware, they have managed to craft an excellent story with really great characters, meaningful decisions, and a superb sci-fi atmosphere and world. This is topped off with some well-done level design (which can get repetitive, but it's not a major detracting factor to me), some of the most gorgeous artistic visuals (just wait until you get to Ilos!), and a memorable music score which further lends to the very distinctive atmosphere this game has.  I don't think that the sequels managed to match this game in the things that it got right, after this Bioware seemed to focus a lot more on making the series into a TPS rather than an RPG - which is fine for some, but I wasn't all that keen on how the game strayed so far from its roots. The inventory can be a bit cluttered with a rather meh UI system, but was it really necessary to cut the thing out of the other games rather than work on improving it?  I am also in the minority of people who loves the Mako and planetary exploration. While the indoor structures do get quite repetitive, as I said, this is the only game in the trilogy which made me feel like you're part of the galaxy with the freedom to explore anywhere.

It is by no means a technically perfect game - the second and third games have this one beat graphically and in some gameplay elements as well (in particular, the inventory system in this first game is a huge pain). However, it is generally considered to have the best and deepest story and lore, and has the best character exposition and interaction of the series.  The main problem with the series as a whole is that you can't get Mass Effect 3 on Steam, and instead have to go through Origin (bleh). Also, the ending of the third game, and therefore the trilogy, kinda sucks without the DLC, some of which is free and some you have to pay for. But the bad taste of the ending is totally worth it for the rest of the package.  So in short, if you enjoy story-driven games or space settings for games, try this series out. Even if you aren't a big RPG fan in general, this one may surprise you. It certainly far exceeded my expectations, to the point that the entire Mass Effect series, when taken as a single saga, is probably my favorite game of all time.",

Probably everything has already been said so there is little i can add since this game is a few years old now, but i'll try my best to describe this game.  Mass Effect is a cinematic Third Persion Shooter RPG with high emphasis on conversations between your character and other characters you will encounter in the game. Throughout the game you will gain new skills for your character and companions and make them at combat or utility (Using Hacking/Electronics and conversations).  You are also able to (Compared to the two later entries in the series) collect actual loot (Armor, weapons and mods) which also allow you to improve your overall combat efficency.  But, combat in the first game of the trilogy is not really the best around is clunky at best. Also the exploration elements (Driving the APC/Tank) can get somewhat boring quickly since it takes up a whole lot of time (That is if you want exp and loot). And some of the side mission enviroments are REALLY repetive at most.  What about the story? You are commander Shepard, who you can shape to your liking (You are also able to choose what gender Shepard has, which can change some conversations in the game) with both looks and background story (3 Premilitary backgrounds and 3 military backgrounds) and class in the game (Which decides what powers and combat abilities you will have). This allows your main character to be pretty much whatever you want and affect his/her backstory in the game.  You end up in a story similar to Freespace 2 (In case you have played it): Its the future and humanity is now living amongst the stars, and a rouge agent is trying to bring back and ancient evil to kill all known life in the galaxy! Now it's up to Shepard&amp;CO to stop this guy at all costs!  Yeah, i dont want to write too much about the story, it's up to you to experience! But to me, this game has a damn good story i really don't want to spoil, and the side characters/companions you meet flesh out the story even more.  And a note; You can load your character into Mass Effect 2 when you complete Mass Effect (1) which allows you to continue you story where you left off, and the second game in the series gets even better...

It's clear that BioWare put way more effort into the main story than the side quests, but I still played as many of them as I could find. The 'Choose Your Own Adventure' aspect of this game is interesting, and I wonder what a subsequent playthrough with different choices would result in.

Mass Effect is a great action RPG that offers a lot of customization. You can play as a male or female. You can be good-natured or somewhat-ruthless. Most importantly, key decisions that you make in this game carry over to Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3 as well.   Regardless of gender, you play as human Commander Shepard. The game starts with you trying to save a human colony from an alien attack. This missions servers to get you accustomed to the mechanics of the game. Combat plays like a third person shooter with abilities, such as being able to deal more damage for a short period of time.   Mass Effect has some really strong RPG elements. You have abilities that you can use to give you an edge in combat and you get a good amount of character customization. The dialogue options are really interesting because most of the key events in the game are dependent on Shephard's morality. Some situations require you to say something threatening to defuse the situation whereas others need you to be kind-hearted. That's the great thing about Mass Effect though: there really is no wrong choice. You get to play the game how you want to play it.   I have a few complaints about Mass Effect. The combat is pretty bad. For some reason, sniper rifles have an annoying sway to them. I get that it's an RPG, but that doens't mean that the action should suffer. Additionally, the inventory system is pretty terrible. Most guns that you pick up are absolute trash. Especially near the end of the game, you'll find yourself having to clear out your inventory. The abilities during combat also have frustratingly-long cooldown, so you're better off just shooting.   Overall, Mass Effect has a great sci-fi story and is definitely worth playing.",

            "review_text": "Easily among, if not, my favorite RPG(s) of all time, Mass Effect is an extremely unique game. In my opinion, it is already a classic that I would place among other masterpieces such as the early Fallout games or Planescape: Torment.  Story: Probably Mass Effect's greatest aspect is its story. The game's universe is extremely interesting and immersive. Everything seems scientifically plausible and is put together in a very desirable package. It is often stated Mass Effect is a Space Opera, and I believe that label is more than perfect for this game. Beyond the backstory and universe, Mass Effect's characters are very well-written and interesting, even the mundane humans have interesting stories, such as the pilot of your ship who has a bone-weakening disease. The plot itself is also captivating, bringing in influences from Lovecraftian horror to the science fiction shows and movies of the late 20th century.  Gameplay: Mass Effect's gameplay is overall pretty decent. It does feel clanky and aged at times, but it by no means makes the game unplayable. There are certain levels of the game I loathe to encounter whenever I replay it (Feros...), but sticking through those rough times and comparing it to the much more fun levels ultimately means I can't say the gameplay is bad by any means. A feature frequently criticized are the (mostly) optional levels where you drive around in an APC called the Mako. I personally enjoyed them but that could likely be just my driving desire to explore the various worlds of the Mass Effect universe.  Replayability: I would recommend most people play Mass Effect at least twice. There are many reasons to come back to Mass Effect such as being able to play as a either a male or a female, romancing different people, or making situational choices. The dialogue your character can say can range from being a kind and noble person to a borderline sociopath. For example: You can use charisma to charm the audience of a reporter trying to make you look bad, or alternatively you can tell her you've 'had enough of her snide insinuations' and punch her in the face. In addition to this there are multiple classes you can play as, from a decidated soldier to a technology specialist  Ultimately, even if you think Mass Effect has fallen from grace (I did not like Mass Effect 3 in the slightest), Mass Effect 1 really has standed the test of time has an incredible RPG and one of Bioware's finest creations.",

It would take more words than are in my vocabulary to describe how fantastic this game is. Almost (for no game is perfect) every aspect of this game is perfect. The only real issues that i have with this game are combat, saveing, and leveling. The combat is very clunky, the cover system is archaec though in some aspects much more realistic than its follow up titles. Instead of locking into cover you run into any form of cover that can be used which leads to unintentional cover breaks and on higher difficulties can lead to your death. The saving system is absoulty terribe. There are little to no autosaves, meaning you have to manually save each time really, this has caused me a few rage quits. (so save often!). lastly the leveling system though complex really has no effect. All the tiers of the skill cause minor improvements which are hardly noticable. Now for the good, (will try to be brief) The real reason this game is worth my full attention, even as an EA title, is its story and characters. Mass Effect is a wondeful story, if a little overdone, all the way from the start to finish you'll be waiting to see what Shepard has to deal with next. The Characters of this story belong in the higher ranks of great characters. Every single character will leave an impact somehow in your memory, either as being your friend or just someone there who occassionally says something, but their strength comes in when you talk to them, each has a thought out personality. Each has their own flaws (which i will not rob you of the satisfaction of figureing it out) and strengths that comes up in dialoge. The best part of the Mass Effect series lies in its base coding. Normal RPG's of this caliber make an event permantly happen, it won't matter what you choose it will not matter. In Mass Effect however it does. you can import your save files into ME2 and then into ME3 to see how your actions impact the galaxy for the years to come.  All in All i give Mass Effect a 99\\100 a near flawless game that is worth every ounce of your time",

However, the action is a little clunky. It's slow to tactically command your squad, and sometimes they move despite their orders. The Mako is remarkably awkward. Pressing only the left or right arrow key moves the vehicle forward in a turn that direction. No gravity effects of being on different planets was noticeable (even though this would have been a great opportunity to bring joy to exploring). Most of the worlds without side missions are canned and practically identical.  That being said, the side missions and the main missions are all wonderful. They have well designed, if linear, levels.

Another advantage is that you can install mods, for example the texture overhaul mod which makes the game look a bit better. One disadvantage is that this game is honestly not that well optimized. I've encounted several bugs and the game crashes on different occations which sometimes makes it tedious playing through the game when you have to repeat a section again. A problem that both the console and PC version shares is the texture pop-ins that occurs in almost every level of the game.   But I prefer the PC version just because you can make the game look better and because you get to use in my opinion the superior input (mouse &amp; keyboard).   TL;DR: Awesome story, okay gameplay, but be prepared to deal with some crashes and bugs!    ",

The story is extremely airtight and has no loopholes and unexplained elements. You have to explore to find out more which was very fun because of all the side missions you could find or do for the various members of the crew. This game is one that I would recommend, because it has a solid skill and combat system and the story makes you want to push forward to uncover it's secrets. Also the fact that you can literally transfer your character to the sequel is very appealing, so you can stay with your first run the entire way through the trilogy.",

It's a brilliant Space Fantasy Role-Playing game set in the distant future starring a party of misfit Extraterrestrials and Commander Shepard... who can Fight like a Krogan and Run like a leopard. It's good on the first playthrough, but that's really about it since most of the game will inevitably end up being the same no matter what choices or gender you choose in subsequent replays. Don't get me wrong, the first playthrough is an epic Space Fantasy RPG in the same vein as Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic (note to self, replay KOTOR) and developed by the same team, it just suffers from the SSDD of being an RPG where most game resources are recycled at least 6 dozen times.   I give Mass Effect a 7.6/10 It's a decent space fantasy Role-Playing game, but I didn't like it THAT much (Same-gender lovin' courtesy of an Asari you rescue from a trap only gives so many extra points)",

It was a bit difficult to understand where the sidequests came from and the UI was also a bit complicated (if you played on harder modes like I did) but I can say that you did in a sense have the chance to make your own little path by going to most of whichever planets you wanted.  Romancing is also something Bioware is usually well known for in their games but the options were extremelly limited here. To three potentials out of everyone to be exact. And the system is very vague for it.  Still, Mass Effect was released in 2007 and considering everything; the combat, the customization, the dialogue, this game was fantastic. Not only great for it's time, but definitely not outdated still! I definitely recomend this game, and I look forward to playing the following instalments of it by importing my descisions made in this game to the next!  My Rating 8.5/10",

Pc port could be better - lack of controller support is really a bummer and the way it's implemented trough mod is not that great, with stiff sensitivity, and need to use kb for some of the commands, which makes left analog stick not respond after, till you move right one.   Combat would be cool, but i don't know...  Ai companinons don't take covers! Dont know why is that.  Missions dont show you where to go on he map. Since this game has got a lot of tidiums - running around, that's a bummer.  Dialog feels a bit long winded and drags on. Very ofen same messege is being repeated just under different sentence. Could be easily condence it in to shorter messeges.   Music is not to bad, thought bit tiering. Just lacking some kick ♥♥♥ themes.  But what keeps me playing is how overall this game holds up together. And even thought the story is everything that I already experienced before it keeps you interested.  Overal its a cool game.

You will loot THOUSANDS of terrible items and only about 100 usefull items throughout the whole game. There are ammo upgrades that do extra damage to Organic enemies and Synthetic enemies, but you'll fight large amounts of Organics one second and large amounts or Synthetics the next second. It gets annoying to keep switching out these ammos when you can just equip Toxic ammo to do extra damage to all targets all the time. Making the ammo upgrades pretty useless. There isn't a whole lot of choice with the inventory system. Of course you want to have the best stuff at all times, so forceing the player to open the inventory and sift through all of the useless stuff to find one or two upgrades is just pointless busy work. There's just not enough depth in the items to justify needing an whole inventory system. Which is probably why the later entries into the Mass Effect Franchise ditched the inventory system in favor of the load out system. Where you just bring 4 or 5 weapons on a mission and just use those until you unlocked something better.  My second gripe is with the vehicle exploration. The vehicle exploration is pretty annoying because the physics are just terrible and there are alot of planets that are full of jagged hillls so traversing those planets becomes annoying VERY quickly.",

Unfortunately gameplay doesn't quite live up to the promise, with multiple systems ranging from combat, exploration, inventory, and level design (yes, I know that's not a system) betraying their lack of experience/expertise outside of RPGs at that point.  Still, for anyone interested in the story of the Mass Effect story should start here, if for no other reason than to appreciate the rather drastic evolution the series undergoes.",

Exploring a wide array of planets that are wonderfully designed is also fantastic. The Mako exploration vehicle can be diffucult to manouver sometimes and has some graphical problems occasionally, but those are only minor issues and doesn't effect the quality of the game that much.  Pros:  Character depth Fantastic, well thought out story that you can get really emotionally invested in like in those certain movies and books.

I've only played for about 17 hours because I want to get to Mass Effect 2, but suffice to say in the 2 days I've been playing I've had a blast. So Mass Effect is a futuristic Si-fi third person over the shoulder shooter in which you play as Commander Shepered fighing his way through enimes such as the geth in order to stop____ (Sorry Spoilers, really don't want to spoil it for the 5 people who haven't pretty much already know the whole plot). Anyways:  Pros: -Great Story (The story is really engaging, and even though most the diologe options lead to the same result it still felt like your really there participating)  -Good Gameplay (The game is really fun to play as it's not super difficult, but the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t rockets that 1 hit you will still make you question your sanity, however the cover system in this game while not bad has it's fair share of problems, as you get hooked on walls alot when you really don't want to (Though that chould just be me), and to boot you have to hold the mouse button through the animation of getting up and aiming then shooting just to start firing your gun/biotic. Through these aren't huge problems they do slightly hinder what is other wise a solid gun play system)  -Characters (This game does a dam fine job of making you feel something for the characters (Until you read the wiki and discover that you only have 2 instaces of death, 1 of them isn't even mandatory). What I mean is, you feel like you want to kick ___(Spoilers) ♥♥♥ at what ever cost, and you feel actual shock that the game ligitimatly kill of one or two of your crew members, it's good stuff  Cons -Bugs ( Now this is a really small issue as I only encountered 1 in my entire play though, but there is a bug where if you don't have certein hardware requirement all the sprites will turn in black pixel messes, this can be fixed by accessing the console and typing veiwmode unlit, but this is still a bug and regardless if it's fixible it's still there)  -Romance System (So for the most part in ME1 the romance system is kinnda crap. In my playthough Shepard hooked up with Ashely (It's not a spolier you meet here in the first half an hour), but I ♥♥♥♥ing hate Ashely. So I read on the wiki and apearently as long as your not a complete ♥♥♥♥♥ to your crew you'll get a hederosexual romance with either Kaiden of Ashely, unless you do certein actions to get a lock in with Liara. For this reason I will now be importing my save to ME2 cuz I heard that being unfaithy to your ME1 intrest can lead to negitive effects in ME3(Yes 3).  -Saves (This is more of a personal problem then anything but, THE AUTO SAVES ARE TOO SPACED OUT!!! I can't tell you how many times I forgot to save then died then had to restart from my last save which was like 30 min ago. While this may not seem like to much time you have to do this over and over if you're like me and don't save ever room you go into. SO TIP TO THE NOOBIE: SAVE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!!!  Thank you for reading and I hope this helps you in your future purchass",

The Mass Effect Universe is a fun place to explore and discover. The setting, story, character and themes are the game's strongest assets. I played through as a soldier. The cover based gunplay is fun but the heat buildup + accuracy decay (and no ammo) approach to weapons is less desirable than the alternative. I'm glad they dropped it from the sequels which use ammunition instead of heat &amp; accuracy but allow a player to shoot to the best of their ability rather than the character's. That said, it's not terrible. Sifting through the inventory is messy, the APC handles awkwardly to say the least, but I enjoyed the vehiclar sequences none the less. Unless you just stand still to take an explosion to the face or get reckd by a Thresher Maw, it's pretty hard to die on normal outside of 'noob mistakes'. Load times can be a bit lengthy.   Overall a very satisfying experience that improves gameplay wise as the series progresses.",

Mass Effect is ♥♥♥♥ing gay, thats right. Its so ♥♥♥♥ing gay it will make you guy and anybody you fingerblast ♥♥♥♥ in the ♥♥♥ gay.

I'll never forget that time Garrus callibrated my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ thats for ♥♥♥♥ing sure. That ♥♥♥♥ was so hawt I creamed 9 times in a 45 second cenimatic.  On the other hand, Mass Effect also focuses on all your weird ♥♥♥♥ed up alien fetishes (remember that one time your parents found your alien porn stash?). Thats right, you can ♥♥♥♥ a race of jellyfish or bird-people (The bird person you ♥♥♥♥ is a guy so have fun with that, confirms game is gay as ♥♥♥♥ and you like it you sick ♥♥♥♥) and so on. You can pretty much fly around as Captain Kirk ♥♥♥♥ing all the alien babes in the galaxy in the stinker hole (remember you dont want any ♥♥♥♥ed up alien/human kids!) so have fun with that you sick ♥♥♥♥.  Also to add on, Mass Effect is really good in the aspect that its lore is amazing, I mean, really just amazing. Whats better than the same character in all 3 games doing the same ♥♥♥♥ing thing? Being able to ♥♥♥♥ the same character in the ♥♥♥ 3 times on the same ship in the same galaxy.
