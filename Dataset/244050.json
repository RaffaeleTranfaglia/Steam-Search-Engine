I am a flight simulator passionate for years,i have thousands of hours in many different combat flight simulator and yes,Rise of Flight IS A GOOD FLIGHT SIMULATOR! I see most negative reviews here are because you only get 2 planes and the rest you must buy!I have played Rise of Flight for more than a year and only recently bought a pack with 6 more planes.The 2 planes that you get for free,the Albadros D.V and the SPAD.13 are two of the best planes in the game!!!Also,the map that you get for free,the Western Front one si the biggest map in the game,so you will not get bored with it!Even tough the Campaigns are not unlocked until you buy a certain plane,let me tell you,i have never even tried the Scripted campaign,even tough i own the necesary planes,because the dynamic career is just SOO much better!You can just literally play it forever!It randomly generates a mission every time! Also when it comes to multiplayer,with the free version of the game you will have no problem playing,and as i said,the 2 free plane sthat you get are one of the best in game,so you will not have that much problem!  To wrap it up,Rise of Flight is the best WW1 flight simulator out there,and one of the best flight simulators in general!Its beautiful,atmospheric and realistic!Totally recomending it!  P.S.:NO,IT IS NOT PAY TO WIN!",

            "review_text": "For those who loved the Red Baron series in the 90's this is an excellent game. Fiendishly difficult if the realism is cranked to the fullest. You can fine tune your realism settings to your liking, but still a decent flightstick is a must. I haven't tried the multiplayer at all. I mostly fly the career mode which is randomly generated and very nicely done. If you're into flight sims and particulary this era, this is a must buy. Yes, there is a lot of money to be spent here, most of the planes are not included in the base game. But like in DCS the quality of the individual planes and the differences in flightmodels and handling are distinct. In my opinion, when something is made with this kind of dedication, it's worth a few euros.  In short: It's a great simulation! You never forget your first air to air victory (because it's hard at first).",

            "review_text": "This is one of the finest flight simulators I have ever played. Been flying sims since I was a kid. There are a few accessories you should probably have to get the maximum enjoyment out of this title and they aren't cheap.   A head tracking device is almost necessary to get the immersion out of this title. When coupled with headphones, you can hear the nuanced wind sounds as you turn your head in your cockpit, trying to keep a beat on your enemies or just looking around at the gorgeous scenary.   A flight stick is highly recommended, of course. Just like trying to play an FPS title with a controller is alike to eating ice cream with a shovel, trying to play a functional flight sim with a keyboard does not allow you the full spectrum of movement that you should have.  Now, you don't have to have these things, but they are very nice to have. The problem is that these things are expensive, as is this game. I wouldn't say it's 'overpriced' because the level of detail makes it evident that there was a lot of work that went into this title. The DLC is also very expensive and it is somewhat harder to excuse this, but the DLC themselves are bundled into packages that at least make sense. For instance, if you buy the package containing bombers, you get mostly bombers.   All things considered, this is a hard game to recommend, unless you fall under the banner of a very niche audience. If you have doubts about this purchase, watch a few videos online and see if this would be for you. It's a beautiful experience, but to get the most enjoyment out of it you have to have a certain set up.",

            "review_text": "Rise of Flight is a World War 1 flight sim that is a game made for flight sim enthusiast's, thus the game tenders to a small audience and genre. The game upon start-up is a tad confusing for someone who has never really had a flight sim, but being a normal gamer I ventured into the unknown playing a quick match. After taking awhile to find the 'Start Mission' button I was off.   The game is visually stunning, even for me with a relatively old gaming rig. The detail to the airplane is stunning and really helps capture the feel of playing in one of these vintage aircraft, from the seat to the gunsight everything seems authentic and comes alive as you fly around and if you have any interest in airplanes this game takes you right in.  For controls it really depends, the only thing I can say specifically is that you NEED a joystick. Its required to play unless you want to spend hours assigning controls to your mouse. Anyways, each plane has its own play style and handles differently. Some planes require more mastery of the controls to play than others. I found that for noobs the best planes to play are German, I found they were easier to control over the British and French planes.  The Game has a couple of different modes, obviously a multi-player mode but it also has a campaign, quick match and Career mode. In Multi-player I feel as though everyone should know how it works but if not: All servers have their own maps and rules with differing difficulties meaning only so much help is given to you via onscreen gauges and auto managed engine controls. Usually the objective is to kill the enemy. Pretty basic. The campaign is (from what I gathered) just a bunch of missions with varying objectives, from intercept enemy fighters to attacking their bases. Finally my favourite mode: Career mode. In Career mode you get to choose from either Belgian, French, British or German careers (When you pick a side you are just picking a squadron from that nationality). Once you've selected what side you want to play for, you can change the date (Between September 1916, to December 1918) to get the aircraft you want, because they are available only during the time they were available during the war. Once you've done that you pick your name, age and background (E.G: I was a fisherman from New Foundland). Finally you get to play the game, the Career mode is connected to a server so you get to see leaderboards for overall scores, and people in your squadrons score. I personally like the feature, adds a bit more of a goal and sort of drives you a bit. The game also gives you a newspaper every week and its actually pretty fun to see the progression of the war in-game and on the right it has the top 50 aces and its cool to see how some keep passing the other. In Career mode you start off as the low of the low, a grunt pilot who gets assigned missions and you do em, but you get a bit of an option. In my first Career mode I decided that doing the missions were not eventful enough so I broke away from my flight and went off on my own to hunt down some Germans, I found 3 and killed them. Returning to base and finishing the flight I got awarded a Victoria Cross and a Military Cross, it was kinda cool to be awarded medals. Makes the game have even more of a goal. After a month of playing I now have him pretty high on the leaderboards. Sadly, the career mode allows for restarting the mission so I doubt many people in the top 100 have played fairly.  One thing that is very angering is the selection of planes, there are around 8-10 base planes. I assume since the game isnt very popular, the dev's made it so that to get any more planes you have to pay for the packs. It wouldnt even be that bad if the packs didnt cost $25-$30. And you only get like 4 planes, a rip off but what can you do? I would personally like to be able to make my own combination of 4 planes and pay like $15. Seems more reasonable. The base planes are among the most popular like the 'Sopwith Camel' and the 'Albatros' so atleast you dont have to be at a disadvantage in multiplayer because they are good fighters, just sucks there is barely any variety.  The learning curve for this game is not that bad, obviously its there and pretty hard but compared to DCS or IL2 its alot better because the planes are relatively simple, and if you really cant stand all the realistic settings you can switch em off which makes it much easier for people who could care less about learning the game and just want to shoot other planes. It caters to hardcore flight sim players and people just interested in World War 1 aviation.  A couple of personal notes that I want to discuss: Multiplayer with friends is absolutely a ton of fun, playing seriously or just messing around; Its a ton of fun. The game allows for players to be in the same plane so you and a couple friends can all be in a bomber just having the laughs of your life or actually trying to win it for the team, either way its awesome. Although, the game as a lone wolf is a bit depressing. Even when trying my hardest the enemy always seems to best me in turning or diving, and no one ever really trys to back you up. Obviously some games people coordinate the team but most times its just Call Of Duty World War 1 planes.   My final verdict is 8.5/10. The game looks amazing, has a pretty wide variety of missions and career mode is endless fun, Multiplayer can be hit or miss with some people and the lack of a variety with the planes kinda sucks. The core mechanics are solid and fluid and the game can be switched from super realistic to arcade style.",

After a lot of thinking, I've only found 2 downsides for this game: the rudder control is poor (I use keyboard - maybe a twisting joystick wouldn't be so bad); and there is only a  *very*  limited number of planes that you can fly without paying any money. As a kind-of third downside (which is only a downside because of how realistic it is), there is a long flight before getting into a firefight in campaign mode. However, autopilot and time acceleration make short work of the potential boredom.",

            "review_text": "i purchased this sim when it first came out around 2010 .... bought 3/4's of planes and bombers (spent well over $100 + $59 for Iron Cross ROF box). House fire destroyed my disc (along with the PC it was in) and documentation. The empty box survived however, lol. Many years later i tried to re-activate my account w/o success. Explaining this so noone thinks im a noob with just the free 2 plane d/l. OKAY... I see complaints about the 'ridiculous' FM, learning curve from hell and the unrecoverable spins, etc. BTW, for those who don't know it, pulling back on stick to recover from a flat spin is ♥♥♥♥ backwards. Get the nose pointed DOWN and apply opposite rudder. Sometimes you may need to Rock the plane depending what plane. Many planes arent recoverable until you get to lower altitude thicker air, others arent recoverable at all. Like others have mentioned, i must STRESS, without a decent JOYSTICK (not a game-controller), you may as well go play Battlefield1. Ive seen guys do well with 'twisty-stick' rudder control, i must have Rudder Pedals however. MAIN POINT: if you are using full realistic flight modelling and weather effects, its going to be tough. HISTORICALLY MORE PILOTS DIED IN TRAINING THEN IN COMBAT. Bear that in 'mine wen u wine'. Flight Models are of course based on research and first hand accounts from the War, so unless my father, who flew WW1 Replicas in airshows (Flying Circus Aerodrome: 1970-1978), was a DEV, FM's are educated guesses. My dad owned a Sopwith Pup (Pitts Special &amp; Globe Swift), also flew DR1, Nieuport17, Nieuport28, Camel, and Rumphler and unfortunately died in a crash taking off a rare Texas Bullet in 1978 (after logging more then 5000 hours, most in antiques, it isnt too surprising)(yes, that's well over 5000, he was also an airline pilot for United and an instructor in WW2). I know a little more about these planes then just pictures in a book btw. I think these guys did a decent job with the FM's. I WOULD however like to see better multi-player servers and more immersive campaigns. In all fairness i have not flown the latest DLC campaigns.  My WW1 'portfolio' :  Wings of Glory (great pre-internet game from Origin); Flying Circus (earliest and most fun arcade-ish mass-multiplaying game ever, by Simguild); Dawn of Aces I &amp; II (Warbirds WW1 sim that never really took-off {pun intended}); Red Baron I &amp; II &amp; 3d (of course); Fly Boys (no multi); RISE of FLIGHT !

            "review_text": "Hi , An Old Pilot ,not a Bold Pilot. The Sopwith Camel is excellent sim aircraft with real world stall/spin aircraft performance. The stall is preceded with aircraft shaking on the edge of a stall... then it lets loose to develop into a full blown gyro lock spin if the pilot does not act, the Camel will lock into a unrecoverable spin. It is the best SIMS Spin in the industry and recovery is ify, you can not use standaed stall recovery in puts. The gyro lock must be prevented by forcing the camels nose down ; this is accomplished by pulling the nose up then down , nose up then push nose down and hold if the nose droppes positive toward ground.... then hold nose down and recover with hands off stick. It helps to switch eng off throttle ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ . Positive speed and lift eng on throttle advanced. It takes a few tries and helps to view the aircraft from F2 view. Good Luck.",

Sounds could be better.. the MGs are drowned out by the engine noise and I have not seen any seperate volume sliders for effects, engine, etc..  A good range of options like autorudder, aiming help, autopilot, easy flight, etc.. to help pilots get used to the aircraft.  Would be nice to have a 'batch' discount for all aircraft to be included instead of nickle and diming each one. I waited for a discount sale on the addons and got 4 of them. Without discount all the STEAM addons would have been quite expensive. I remember RB3D had more planes and was far cheaper.. around $40 when it was released. Now its on STEAM for far less and if you have a Glide wrapper the graphics are fairly good for an old title.  For a more modern version of RB3D this ROF title is a reasonable move up for graphics, reasonable authenticity, and interface. If they made a batch sale for all aircraft and addons I think it would get a lot more attention, especially considering it is already several years old.  Overall I do recommend it since you can play it with a few planes for free and then decide which addons to purchase from there.  Thanks.",

            "review_text": "It's been about 100h since I started playing RoF (including non-steam demo). I wanted to wait some time to be able to say something more about it.   At the beggining I must admit I was never a big fan of fly simulators but I've been fan of WWI aviation since I remember. Actually this game 'forced' me to buy joystick because previous one was way way to responsive and was cause of many problems due to very light planes. Surprisingly I've never had any problems with DCS World - different kind of planes? I believe that after few years spring in my joystick was to soft at the crucial moments.  Visuals are amazing and runs smooth on I3 3220 and 7870 on high details. I had to turn some of effects off obviously but thats understandable. Sound freeks me out when you diving and can actually feel that speed.  Lots of game modes - career, quick battles, missions, multiplayer. Like I said before - 100h already and I don't even fell that I achieved anything. Multi still alive but unfortunately you'll have to content oneself with FEW servers. When I type few I mean two max three. They're nerver full but It doesn't affect gameplay. All you need is 8-12 planes maybe bit more to have fun and spend some nice quality time with new friends. Because community is so small people are very friendly and happy to help everytime when you need advice. They will cover you, help and make you feel comfy. Lets be honest. Learning curve is very demanding and without internal help you won't be able to be compatitive. Some of them play from release day and there is no chance you will even approach them in combat. They fly on the edge and know every weaknes of your plane. I'm wondering... maybe just because that game is so difficult makes it so rewarding? EVERY single plane shot down in multiplayer makes you happy and smile instantly and you know by the time it's something. It's not a next random kill in FPS game - at least I feel it in that way.  Do I recommend that game? YES. Oh yes. RoF is expensive if you'd like to buy all DLC at once but there is no need to do it. Few monts ago RoF was in some bundle and can be available on steamtrades easily. Even the basic version provide high quality of fun for many hours. What I do is: I just buy on every sale some DLC and improve my gameplay and experience. Spent 30 flying my career with Nieuport 17 and after that time I bought DLC with weapons upgrade. What you can do is install additional guns in your planes to increase firepower. Not only this but thats the main reason. After that change I was exited to spend next 30 or more hours flying the same plane cose it gained new quality.   Hopefully this helps.",

So much so that I went and picked up a set of rudder pedals as the twist on my joystick was a bit off. That being said, you do need the hardware to play and you need quite a bit of it to play online and still compete. Joystick is a sheer minimum, I would also recommend the flight pedals, possibly a throttle control and for the ultimate, TrackIR (I'm not sure if any VR goggles work or work well). That's one of the two 'irks' with this game: in addition to the big price tag for the base game as well as the additional planes, you could easily shell out $400 for a flight sim rig (joystick, rudder control, throttle control and head movement control), so be told! The second irk is the 'Career Mode' which is currently in Beta, but (as of this writing) is busted. It's what I play flight sims for, a bit of role playing along with my air combat. The developers have had downtime and a big patch and the issue wasn't addressed (and may be the cause according to the developer forums). At a higher level it looks like the developers are very, very passionate on modeling flight and combat, but could use a bit of help in developing a game: the learning curve is pretty much vertical (which I expect in a flight sim) but there are very few in-game assets in getting new pilots up to speed.  In all, I'd say if you are a fan of realistic flight combat sims (not arcade ones), already have the hardware, and are willing to wait for a good sale (especially for the extra airplanes), have at it. If you are looking for something with a slightly shallower learning curve, there are other, better options for you. Now if you will excuse me, I need to price out a new HOTAS rig.

In order to play a campaign of any length of time, you really need to go beyond this starter pack and invest in some of the DLC. I suppose what did it for me was spending half an hour trying to find a squad I COULD fly for, then by sheer luck the very next day that squad switched out to a new set of aircraft, and would I like to buy that airplane?  It's worth nothing that while you COULD just buy one plane at a time through RoF's site, here you're investing in DLC 'packs.' Overall this starter set is an effort to get you interested enough to invest more heavily and buy all their DLC. Only then will you have close to a complete game. Again, compared to at least one competitor which gives you everything from 1915 two-seaters through to the Armistice...it's a no brainer.  ",

The lag (at least on my computer) made the game almost nausiating.Like if there was a thin layer of glue underneath the pointer that was slowing it down. The same situation with the flight controls, as if they had a delay before they were registered into the computer.  If the developers just made a purchase fee for the entire game, it would be one of the better games on steam, but instead they presented Rise of Flight as freeware.  If this game gets abandoned and forgotten, I will be a little sad of what great potential it once had,.  If the devollopers decide to make a game with the same concept and make it an initial fee game, I will totally buy it.  But not this garbage bag full of pubes.",

Controls were great, proper mapping, didn't need to change but one or two buttons on my joystick. Create the mission, get my plane setup, ready to launch. Mission is cancelled, becaue the only plane I'm able to select is either unavailable to my account, or the file was modified. Seeing as how I just downloaded this game, the only logical explanation was that I couldn't use the only plane I was able to select. I tried launching three missions, and every time I was unable to figure out how to select another plane.  I went to the forums looking for assistance as to how to fix this issue, couldn't find any posts for it. I posted a question on what I'm doing wrong. Just out of curiosity, I tried to relaunch the game in order to see if I can't figure it out on my own. Game then kept crashing every time I tried to launch it. Three consecutive tries.

The dog fighting feels spot on and realism CAN be adjusted for more arcade style flying, my only issue is that there is a lack of feedback when you hit other aircraft. The only time that you KNOW that you have scored hits or a kill is a light hint of smoke or the sudden breakup of an arcraft. That's a shame since the damage moddling is actually otherwise really good.  The full reason for the non recomendation though is how this game feels like a big stinking con. The campaings are lacking with there only being four structured linear campagins on offer, and one of those is the poor tutorial missions! Then there is the VERY limmited number of aircraft with the packaged game, and DLC aircraft are already IN the game but NOT flyable until you pay a frankly stupid amount of money for the privilage of taking the controls, and a single sinking solo mission per aircraft. Also any DLC bought has to be redeamed through the game NOT automatically added, in the most pain in the ♥♥♥♥ fashon possible (no copy/paste allowed).  While the tempation to fly stringbags is strong (it suckered me in), avoid this like genital herpes for it's annoying anti-consumer ideology. Want a decent (but older) flight sim that offers better and fairer bang for £$£$? Check out Il-2 1946 that while much older offers 300+ and lots of campaigns for the price of a pint or two, unlike RoF £15.99 for 4 planes.",

I agree with Justmeman117, this 'game' is only a Demo.
