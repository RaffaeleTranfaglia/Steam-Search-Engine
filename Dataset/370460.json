            "review_text": "So far so good. The game runs great and is a huge step above ASW's last release with Battle Fantasia. Let's get this minor thing out of the way right off the bat. There is something odd that makes the game backgrounds, menus, text look more pixelated at 1080p. Keeping it at 720 looks crisp on a 1080p monitor. What ever it is that is upscaling the image and making it look that good must be black magic.   I've just hit up training mode and had a few online matches and the game is running without any hitches and the online matches that are of decent distances are played pretty damn good. I don't know if there is a region select in the menus, but that would probably help with people finding smoother matches. That's probably asking for too much since that would fracture the already small player base that this is going to have. Even so, the matches I've found so far have been from tolerable to excellent. The netcode is more than adequate, the problem is finding people who don't live 2,000 miles way from you.   I will update this review later with more gameplay and mode impressions after spending more time with the game. Those worrying about performance and connectivity should purchase this without any worries.",

            "review_text": "What do you get when you mix kung fu and waifu? You get Arcana Heart 3: LOVE MAX!!!!! Solid fighting game with an interesting roster of fighters. I really liked the story mode, although there are a few modes to choose from, sure to keep a person busy for hours. What really impressed me is the controller support, yes it has full controller support(XBOX360), but it also is coded for a fight stick too(DINPUT 10 button controller). And thats a big deal to me, beacuse sure a person could re-map your controller in the options, but I'm lazy and I don't want to. Looks to be a 16/9 720P screen with the actual fight scen to be letterbox 640x480, its not quite pixel art, but its definitely low-res. Something to keep in mind if you feel strongly about console ports on your PC. And it definitely feels like a XBOX360 port to me, not a bad thing though. Its a really fun colorful game with so much charm and waifu. 8/10 for me",

            "review_text": "This game is quick to dismiss for its price tag and its initial presentation of anime-heavy content but it's actually fun to pick up as a fighting game and let's be honest we could all use some extra cuteness brighten a bad day.  -PROS- Mechanics are what you will enjoy here because everyone is capable of dashing/canceling very easily. It's not as 'on-point' demanding like in Guilty Gear or others that require (Roman) canceling to be done only with certain moves with very specific frames of attack.   The clash system will also keep you on your feet and help give you a fighting chance in times you'd least expect it. Clashing is when two characters hit each other in their hitboxes and their attacks stop in their tracks. You are then given the option to try and get another attack in before your opponent does during the clash animation.  The supers in this game are fun to abuse. Heck the Arcana Eclipses are basically a free super attack. You have to go into Extend Force to use one but extend force refreshes very quickly. (Like a few seconds) and also your character's own super meter recharges fast too. Remember the effort it takes to get a level of super in other games like street fighter and when you lose that level it takes a lot of effort to get it back? In this game you can just turtle for a couple of seconds and you can get it back. With 23 characters all completely different from each other and 23 Arcanas to choose from you can mix things up and have fun working around seeing what works and what's just plain gimmicky. (Brawlers that zone with long range pink lazors? WTF....surprisingly it's highly effective.)  There are some other things to do:  Survival(which really needs to be changed to Score Attack. That's what it is. You're still allowed to keep trying on the same fight you lose so it's not really survival which you must defeat as many as you can while given only one chance.) Time Attack, and Trials for the characters.   The trials pit you against CPU opponents that ENCOURAGE you to use the game's mechanics. Like teching/jump cancels/etc. It helps give players that don't have much experience in fighting games to actually try some of the more advanced stuff instead of just giving them a dummy to pound and a command list of the special moves and leaving the players with no clue how survival in games like this works.  However this game isn't without some really bad serious flaws.  -CONS- Obviously fighting games never offer much in the realm of rewards. Your best reward is defeating tough opponents online, I'd imagine.   The unlockables are just anime artwork/visual stuff and the after story is just some anime episode shoehorned into this game that has nothing to do with what is really happening in the main plot. There isn't even much fighting in it it's just a lot of dialog. It's almost as if it feels the girls' main life outside of conflict is more important the catastrophic events that took place beforehand. Pretty stupid ♥♥♥♥ but it has those warm cute moments.  When you're doing stuff outside of story mode, you're going to hit stuff that is scaled incorrectly with respect to difficulty curve.  I know that sounds greek so I'll spell it out.   When you're doing the Time Attack/Survival/10th trial gold medals you're going to hit broken CPU opponents that are going to pit you against odds that are impractically doable or just downright borderline impossible to combat. Some of which is said to even be tougher than King of Fighters bosses, or so I've been told. If you're already more than familiar with this game...you know who I'm talking about. The primary reason this is horrible is because these are your final bosses that you must beat to place your score. You could clean sweep your way to the end and have to fight something horribly broken compared to everything else you had to fend off to get to the near end. It's not so bad in the 10th trial because that's a purely optional thing to do but for Survival and Time Attack that was an awful idea to put stuff like that at the very end.  Summary Overall the game is fast paced and fun and gives players many options to combat with so whether you want to play on your own with a friend and goof around seeing what does what it's great. If you want to go competitive the adrenaline from the insanity is worthwhile. I do recommend it but 20$ would've been a better price. I felt like I was paying 15$ for a nice fighting game and another 10$ for some anime stuff as an feature buying this on it's prerelease discount of 10%(or whatever it was.)",

            "review_text": "This game is a lot of fun. The art is great and the combos are not too difficult (although I prefer really easy fighters like Marvel Vs Capcom). The online is smooth with minimal lag.  One downside is that the game crashes at the loading screen a lot. It's rare I get to play this game in story mode for more than 15 minutes.  If you aren't that good at fighting games, be prepared to get absolutely dominated in boss fights.",

However, You should probably train up first before attempting to play online. Online will mostly be dead but there are groups that actively still play this game. I love diving in to new fighting games and see if their is potiental for me to learn. I've always been a die hard Street Fighter and Smash Bros.. only! but this game is opening me up to a brand new genre thats even more fast-pace the games I am used to. I recommend this game.. and hopefully we can play sometime!",

            "review_text": "I requested a refund of this game. I decided to post my motivation for it as a review, for it might help inform people as well.  DISCLAIMER: I am not a fighter nut. I cannot name all BlazBlu's, nor do I have some acade-like controller enshrined at home. The only fighter I played much was touhou 12.3, at wich I was 'good' or 'decent'. Your mileage might vary, and if you are a pro at fighters like these you'll probably laugh at my feeble attempts at beating the game. In which case, read other reviews to decide.  While I am no prodigy at fighting games, I can easily beat the AI in story mode without losing any health... Untill I get to the last day/level. This 'scharlachenrot' character is way harder than the rest of the AI, constantly spamming long range attacks and using that godawful cannon. So either I have to crank the difficulty way down and have the other AI so dumb that they just stand still for 5 seconds mid battle, or I do fine but get trashed by this cannon at the end. That is not challenging gameplay, neither good game design.  I put the 'Game difficulty' setting at 1. The story mode AI became, well, downright mentally defective. I got 'scharlachenrot' down to 1-3 pixels of healthbar... when she did her 'finisher' (huge lasers from cannon) TWICE IN A ROW. I still died. Might be my skills, but not fun. Not fun at all. It really feels like someone on the enemy team is cheating.  On a different note, there is no way to remap half of the controls, and it does not recognize my gamepad. I am quite tech savvy and know how to map my gamepad to keyboard buttons, but that I spent ~40 minutes of the 2 hours I played on getting my controls to work does not do my impression of this game any favors. It lists 'full controller support' which is a downright lie, for you cannot map 'TAB' to any controller button and have to press it on your keyboard, unless you use an external program to do gamepad to keyboard mapping.  Lastly it offers 1920x1080 'Support' but the sprites are horribly upscaled. Blurry and pixelated. There exists algorithms that scale old GBA sprites up better, look it up on wikipedia. Downright inexcusable for a game that costs 28 euros.",
