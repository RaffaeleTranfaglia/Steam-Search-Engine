            "review_text": "(I played this game for dozens of hours on Desura) One of the most original and charming games I discovered in 2014. Just make sure to keep your expectations in check. Its a slower paced 'puzzle' game with a god sim theme, requiring some micromanagement and is not a sim/RTS game. I found this game to be incredibly charming and the developer pulled of the theme as a puzzle game incredibly well. The individual levels are incredibly diverse and can be quite long, so this isnt a game, where you'll finish a level within 5 minutes, but its totally worth digging into.  Lower the sea levels to create new paths and create your own Cubie micropopulation! Love this game.",

I recommend this game for players... ...who are patient and are not to shy away from playing a level over and over again ...who like challenging games with cute and colourful design ...who like god themed games ...who searching a good value for money game ...who are not afraid to play a (forced) tutorial first, which is necessary for learning the game unique features  By the way: I played this game many hours via Desura before",

            "review_text": "Game attempts to be Populus more or less, but with an easier entrance point. The rate of aquiring wheat, the main resource is shown by each field, not overall, and little things missing like that add up to undermine gameplay. Using a unit to do anything kills it, with good measure cause you never seem to want population, but it makes gameplay tedious, and god games usually have some elements of tedium but this game it is the bread and butter, all micro. It would be forgivable if it was fun, but sending your minions to their doom doesn't even give you the satisfying pop noise lemmings did, nor does the game challenge you to master it's minusia. Once I got to the level that wanted me to mine through the world I found the few camera controls massively insufficent. This game just doesn't leave much satisfaction, but is happy to eat up your time without good reason. Seems like the game just needed polish to make it more smooth and enjoyable, but what currently exists is just rather bland.",
