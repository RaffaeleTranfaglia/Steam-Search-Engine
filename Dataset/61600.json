You wrap rope around different shaped things and try to cover as much as possible, there's other mechanics added in, and it's ridiculously addictive. One problem for me though is that, for some reason, sound effects keep cutting out halfway through, but I'm sure it's either a result of my probably mediocre sound card or a bug I will get around to working out.",

The goal is to wrap a piece of rope around an object, trying to cover every area of this very object. But all I want to do is cover the ENTIRE area of the object (OCD anyone ?) and that's the most difficult part. Sure, you don't NEED to cover the whole area, but it's what I want to do. So no Zen moments for me. But it's enjoyable nonetheless.  [Rating: 70/100]",

Some of the shapes are really tricky. Highly recommended for the casual gamer.",

I do still prefer the controls on a touchscreen, but the graphics and the fact that you can take as long as you want to complete levels make the PC experience a pleasure as well. The only big flaw with the game is that the rope's 'stickiness' sometimes feels uneven since it will sometimes act like it's glued down and other times slip off easily. It's not a dealbreaker by far, but it does make it a bit annoying at times when close to 100% on an object.",
