            "review_text": "I’m downvoting this game with extreme prejudice because it has a crash bug which has been left unaddressed for over a year: players who have Nvidia cards with up-to-date drivers will find that the game will always freeze on the final boss. It seems that some recent version of Nvidia drivers broke some graphic effects in late-game cutscenes. Unfortunately, the rights to this game are a royal cluster of bureaucracy between Disney, CAPCOM, and WayForward, and nobody seems interested in addressing the issue, or even acknowledging that this game exists anymore. Basically, if you don’t have access to a PC without an Nvidia card, do not buy this game, as you will not be able to finish it without skipping specific cutscenes and using weird workarounds.  Aside from that unforgivable issue, the game is okay. It is a decent remix of the original DuckTales NES game, and is sure to bring waves of nostalgia to anyone who has fond memories of it. For the unfamiliar, DuckTales is a barebones, unremarkable platformer where the main gimmick is that you can bounce around on a pogo stick which can break bricks, defeat enemies, and cross dangerous terrain – think of Shovel Knight’s down-stab attack, but one that works nearly anywhere and not just on top of enemies.   But the game is certainly is a “remix” and very much not the same game as it used to be. Imagine the differences between Super Mario Bros. 3 and New Super Mario Bros, and you'll get a decent idea of how this game has been updated. Differences include:  - Save points! Unlike the NES game, you can save your game between levels and come back later (unless you’re an achievement hunter playing Extreme difficulty, in which case you’ll have to beat the whole game in one sitting anyway… sorry!). - Greatly improved controls which make it much easier to master the pogo stick. - Large changes in level design which make them easier, but the addition of more fetch quests make them longer. - Bosses are harder and longer with the addition of long unskippable invulnerability periods. - Some plot events have been removed, such as the Transylvania detour in the mines level, and the paywall in the Amazon level. - Money collected in-game is more than just score, and can be spent on gallery unlocks.  The new sprite animations are absolutely adorable, and the soundtrack by Jake Kaufman (composer for Shovel Knight and the Shantae series) is just epic – the soundtrack alone is, in my opinion, worth more than the price of the game. But it seems that this game’s main draw is its storytelling and voice acting – several of the voice actors from the DuckTales TV show have returned to voice the characters, and the levels play out like an episode of the show with numerous cutscenes. This is where the game somewhat fell flat to me. Although the scripted cutscenes obviously had a lot of heart put into them, I found them mostly annoying, pointless, and not nearly as funny or clever as the show they try so hard to pay tribute to. After seeing each cutscene once, I saw no reason not to just slam on the “skip cinematic” button on all subsequent playthroughs, and that makes me a bit sad, because I feel like that’s where most of the charm of this remake is supposed to be coming from.   Final verdict: don’t buy, because we PC gamers need to put pressure and accountability on the corporate red tape which prevents developers from supporting the games they make. Talk with your wallet, as they say, because that’s the only way they’ll listen. Leaving a reproducible crash bug that prevents the game from being completed, especially near the end of the game when refunds aren’t available anymore, is simply unacceptable for everyone involved.  But if you want to ignore me and buy the game anyway, keep in mind that this is a game meant to be played with nostalgia goggles firmly glued to your face. If you’re a huge fan of the original NES game, then you’ll probably love this from beginning to end. But if you’ve never played DuckTales before, you might find the level design to be a bit empty, tedious, and pointless – you’d probably get more overall joy out of Shovel Knight. It’s not a terrible game by any means, but if you're a newcomer to the game then it probably won't blow you away.",

There are a few mechanical problems (hard pogo and stairs rarely function in tandem), but they should not be enough to ruin the experience for someone pursuing the game for what it is. The newest patch removed what I believed to be the worst part of the game - the long cutscenes. If you enjoy platformers there is no reason not to pick this game up.",

            "review_text": "A wonderful and loving remake of a classic early 90's NES hit.   Platforming at it's almost best. A unique mechanic (The Pogo Stick of Doom, wielded by ol'Scrooge) brings around a bouncing mechanic not found in normal 2D platformers. In an age where we see new and innovative stuff churned out in this genre almost every year, this project brought together the essence of the old NES Game.  This however brought along a few hiccups which are annoying at most. The cut-scenes are a wee bit dull, and only skippable if you select 'Skip Cutscene' in the pause menu. The final boss is just as annoying as it was in the original which is either my bad memory, or an oversight.  In this nostalgia romp for yours truly, I enjoyed this game for exactly what it was. A trip down memory lane in the city of Duckburg, only done in a visual style that reminded me of an episode of the show.   7.5/10. Would recommend to young ones, Platforming fiends, and those who have a soft spot for the penny-pinching McDuck Clan.",

Who am I kidding, he's never locked up. But this game, it's fantastic, magical and I can safely say it's the most innocent, harmless fun I have had in a game for years.  Despite it's name, it's much less of a remastered game than a completely redux of one. A lovley mixture of 2.5D visuals, well done and cartoonish sprites, it's really got Disney written all over it. The music, is wonderful, I could listen to the theme tune all day!   For gameplay, DuckTales: Remastered doesn't have much going for it. Mainly because it's a game targeted at children, so it's understandable why it's easy to use. Simple button controls, jump, hit, brutally murder, the usual.   My one issue with the game, is that it doesn't do much to make me come back, other than improve my rankings on the World Leader Boards. And that final boss battle. It's hard. The story is short and can be completed in 3 hours or so, and of course there are achivements and trading cards that could keep you busy.  All in all, DuckTales is just harmless fun, even if it is a little guilty pleasure game.  + 2.5D! + A complete over-haul of the original, everything is new.  + Great character design and voice acting.  - Not much to do after the campaign is finished. - The game get's repetative after the first act.   8.5/10.",

Lots of dialogue has been added as well, giving it more of its own storyline to follow. I like that you can jump into your money bin and sort of swim around, just for fun. I played the original NES game again just before this one, and I found the ways that they managed to update the game while still staying faithful to the original were pretty clever. I'm not a big fan of the new tutorial level (Scrooge's Moneybin); it's just not as interesting as the rest of the game, but it is just a tutorial I guess. Also, Scrooge doesn't sound as energetic or enthusiastic as he probably should for the situation (demanding his nephews be set free or narrowly escaping death), but it's still pretty awesome that the original voice actor for Scrooge (now in his 90's) voiced it.  Gameplay wise, it's the same as the original, with some tweaks. A 2D platformer with a pogo-cane attack. There is a extra heart powerup hidden within each level, as well. I played through the game on 'easy' and found it very easy to complete (you have unlimited lives). I can see it becoming a challenge on the harder difficulties, though, since the bosses are by far the most challenging parts of the game.  I really enjoyed it, and would recommend it to people who enjoy oldschool platformers, and ESPECIALLY fans of the original NES game.",

The moment you see the cartoon-accurate sprites and hear Scrooge and his nephews talk with their original voices from the 80s cartoon, you will fall in love. It really does feel like a long lost episode! Of course, when you replay levels, you won't have to go through all the cutscenes again... and you don't have too, thanks to a scene skip option! (My only wish regarding the cut scenes was that there was an option to turn off the subtitles.)  It can be bit a bit brutal at times, depending on what difficulty you're playing it on (with some deaths feeling like they weren't your fault at all), but you will feel a great degree of satisfaction when the credits roll.

The controls are responsive and I never felt like a death was because of anything but my own bad decision or reaction to a foe.  There's some notable differences between the difficulty levels I appreciate, as well. Besides enemies dealing increased damage and your maximum health meter being lower, the (new) mapping function is disabled on Hard. Conversely, on Easy, you have infinite lives, so you never have to restart a level over unless you choose so yourself. There's a multiplier for the rewards found per level based on difficulty, however, and said money (as well as the art &amp; music unlocks) are retained between playthroughs, so besides the achievements, you have something else to shoot for once you've completed it the first time.  If you want something that plays like the good ol' Nintendo days, but looks and sounds like it was ripped right out of the Disney Afternoon, then it's worth taking a trip to Duckburg. Woohoo!",

So why I am not going to recommend this game to buyers?  Well the game played great for me throughout the first 5 levels, but on the last level, right before the last boss, the game crashes. I mean, honestly, what frustrates me the most is that the crash happens right before the last boss, RIGHT BEFORE! No matter what I do, reinstall game, skip cinematics, sacrifice a horned toad to the gods of computer crashing, nothing. I cannot finish this game! So therefore, I cannot recommend anyone to buy it.   I have read this issue happens to some people, can't really say a lot of people, but surely some. Maybe you'll buy this game and nothing will happen and then you can come back to this review and mock me for not being able to enjoy the sweet relief of a plot twist being unraveled. Then again, maybe you'll run into the exact same issue I have, or worst.    In any case, buy this flawed gem at your own risk. If anything, wait to get it on sale discount and keep it in your library for when technology will be advanced enough to fix whatever issue is going on with the last boss.

In a sentence: gaming has moved on since the original release and this re-mastered version is stubbornly refusing to.    First up, I loved the music of the original and really enjoyed the game as a kid. I remember it being a bit frustrating back then like so many games from that era(Ghostbusters on Nintendo to this day defeats me). Nevertheless I assumed (as it turns out, wrongly) that I must have found it difficult because of my age and lack of experience and I would be able to tackle this remastered version without too much difficulty. I couldn’t have been more wrong. Although the game looks and sounds great (and it really sounds great), the hit detection on enemies and the environmental objects is a little off which can make a big difference. The levels are gorgeous to look at, with Transylvania Castle being a standout however, the actual design is not polished in the way modern platformers like Super Meat Boy, or even Rayman, are.   All too often enemies are positioned such that you can only kill them by taking a hit yourself, a concession the game itself seems to recognise. Almost immediately after you encounter such poorly placed enemies there is a health pick-up. It’s as though the game is saying “yeah, we know that is a moronic place to put that enemy, so here, have some cake by way of an apology.” Except that doesn’t work when you only have room to take one more hit. You never get the cake, you only get frustrated. You can vary the height of your jump but when you use the pogo jump the method of controlling that height is just too inconsistent.   To add to this frustration, the game sticks rigidly to its old school roots. This means you can only take so many hits before you die and only so many deaths before it is game over. When it’s game over you are sent back to the level select screen to start over. No checkpoint continues here, oh no. Back you go to the menu to select that level again. This is a truly baffling design choice. Sending you back to the level select instead of letting you simply restart the level only adds to the pent up frustration.  Each level can take 20-30 minutes and when you are replaying the same level over and over, only to get to the boss, die and have to play through another 20 minutes to get back to the boss only to die again, it becomes very grating very quickly.   Then end level deserves a special mention. When you think you have completed the game there is an after-boss section which will push you to the brink. Its inclusion seems totally needless and when you sit through the end of game credits to read of how many game testers and QA people were involved in this product it simply boggles the mind that they decided to leave this in. 6 hours of my life I will not get back.  I started it so I finished it, and if nothing else, the look and sound of the game kept bringing me back which counts for something. The original voice cast is a nice touch as is the added in-game concept art etc.   Why do I recommend it? Well if you played the original you will mostly like this re-master. If you didn't play the original I would say try this out with my comments in mind. It is not a terrible game by any stretch and it will bring a smile to your face, but it is not a top tier platform game and as you play through it you will come to appreciate just how far platform games have come.",

            "review_text": "'Good, but ultimately disappointing.' 7/10  This game was an overall satisfying experience for me and I would most likely recommend it to fans of platformers in general, but in the long run, 'DuckTales: Remastered' just doesn't compare to the original. I'm not sure what it is, but something was lost in the translation; it just doesn't have the same charm that the original game had for the NES. But without comparing this game to the original, it's still an enjoyable experience. But how could I not compare this to the original? It's arguably one of the greatest games for the original Nintendo console, and tons of people, myself included, hold it near and dear to their hearts. So it's nearly impossible not to compare this 'updated' version to the original game that came out almost three decades ago.  One of the biggest reasons this game doesn't have the same charm as the original, at least for me, is the soundtrack. I know some people think they did a great job with it, and maybe they did, but most of the new versions of these beloved songs are just awful, and at times barely even recognizable. I would have been much happier with this game if they had just re-released the same game with the same music and just updated the textures, but whatever, it's not the worst thing ever. And I'm not sure if they went ahead and made some of these levels longer, but the levels feel longer, and sometimes for no reason at all other than to extend the time of play. And lastly, the cut-scenes; these initially made me dislike the game greatly as there are far too many of them, but once you realize you can skip them, they're not so bad.  Overall, this game is good, but it could have been much better. If you've never played the original than you will probably like it more than I did. It's got everything you want in a solid title; the controls are tight, the graphics are crisp and look great in high resolution, it works perfectly with a controller, and the voice acting is very well done.",

Most of the time the hit box for a character is inside a sprite or model. In this game it surrounds the whole sprite . So walking or jumping into things that you think you won't take damange from happens till you get used to it. Also the games design could have been better at teaching you when you should normal jump and when you should pogo jump, there are no sections that teach you this. You are just expected to die and learn.   Other than those issues, the game captures the style and feel of the cartoon it is based on. They went as far as to get the original voice actors to make this feel like an episode of Duck Tales. I also really enjoyed the backgrounds since they really take after the Carl Barks comics. Overall I recommend this game.",

So even though nostalgia wasn't a big part of it, I'm glad to report I still find this game entertaining (and even challenging at times). However, I do have a couple of complaints:  1. The 2D character sprites look great but they do not fit in well with the rest of the art (backgrounds, chests, gems, etc.), which is unfortunately 3D. IMO, they should've kept everything in the iconic cartoon style of the Donald Duck universe. This is by far my biggest gripe with the game.  2. At the time of writing, I'm aware of two major bugs: (a) The level is not reset when you respawn. Hence, the baddies will continue doing whatever they were up to when you lost your previous life. This is unfortunate, as it means that losing your first hit point may be unavoidable. And while bosses do indeed respawn, their effects do not (e.g., if you die at the wrong time during the fight with the boss in the Amazon, the ground might still be shaking from when it slammed into it before). (b) Lots of people report that the game crashes for them when they reach the final boss. I don't know whether it will be the case for me as well but I thought I'd give you a heads up.  3. Even though they were probably never a part of the original version, they should've added special-case animations for talking characters. It's a little silly to see them talk with their mouths closed.  That said, I'm hoping for a remastered version of DuckTales 2.  Cheers, Bogdan",

Don't get me wrong, up to the final level the game is beautiful and I played it with a big grin on my face because it brought back memories from my childhood when I watched the TV Show.  When the fight with Dracula takes place, after you beat it, a game breaking bug occurs, namely the game freezes although the music is still playing and you have to kill the process. To fix it, I had to set the processor affinity to one core and when beating Dracula and the animation starts, immediately pause the game and select Skip cutscene, allowing me to continue the game.  Before the game ends there's what must be one of the worst designed levels I've seen, not necessarily because of the idea behind but because of the unresponsive controls and the unusually bigger hitboxes around the blocks that make you fail. It was impossible to play this level with my controller (although I played the rest of the game with it) and I had to finish the game with the keyboard. The chain and lava sequence is exceptionally bad because the character refuses to stick to the chains when the corresponding button is pressed and if the key doesn't register you fall down and need to restart the sequence. So you end up needing to press repeatedly the corresponding key when jumping from chain to chain, hoping that one of the presses sticks and the character doesn't fall down. This never happened with the chains outside this area, just with those from the last sequence.  I'm not sure why the controls in the last level are so bad, but my guess is they are intended like so to increase the difficulty in a synthetic manner. Or maybe it was another bug. I don't know, but this killed the enjoyment for me, because having to redo the same sequence over and over again because of broken mechanics, in my book, it equals to bad design and not a fun experience.  So, let's cut to the chase: - Do I recommend it? Yes, up to the last level, then it's up to your luck if the game behaves or not. - Should you buy it? Only on sale. I got it for about $4.5 and I think it was worth it. - Is it a fun experience? Definitely, up to the last level when, if you have a short fuse, you might end up rage quitting it. I'm usually quite calm, so I finished it although it annoyed me a bit. But take this as a warning if you have a quick temper.  Also be warned, the game might break for you and you might not be able to finish it because of the Dracula fight's bug. To be honest even so, you don't miss out on anything and you're still left with the best part of the game minus the annoying elements of the last section.  These being said, it was a nice experience although with some quality defects.",

It's difficult to live up to nostalgia, and this game probably was facing unrealistic expectations from the beginning. The game is kind of fun, but it's not particularly challenging once you figure out where all the health pick-ups are. I enjoyed the boss fights, but the platforming elements were a little tedious.  I was getting annoyed in the last level, in particular the last part (don't want to spoil the ending) because I thought it required a ridiculous level of precision. But then I finally realized that using the analog was the problem and switched to the D-pad, all was fine.  Graphics-wise, the characters are beautifully drawn. Unfortunately, the same love and attention wasn't put into the scenes, where some of the things like helicopters look like they were drawn and shaded with Microsoft Word ... not even Microsoft Paint.  The collectibles consist of art and music that can be unlocked through purchases using money you've gathered in each level. Unfortunately, you would need multiple playthroughs to get to the best stuff: the music and TV show art. And I didn't enjoy the game enough to play through more than once, so I was never able to access them.  The unskippable cut scenes were the biggest grip that most people had. The developers added an option to skip them. I will say that the worst part of the cut scenes wasn't that they were unskippable (at the time) ... it's how utterly boring the dialogue was. Seriously, was the show ever that bad?  I have to deduct a point in principle for the unskippable credits, taking the overall rating down to a 5/10. I don't generally mind unskippable credits, but 1) at least making it interesting, and 2) don't include every single person in all of Capcom! Seriously, the credits are obnoxiously long.",

            "review_text": "I had my eye on DuckTales Remastered for awhile now, since I loved the NES game so much. Well it was on sale this week so I decided to pick it up and I don't regret it.  It's a great nostalgic throw back to a franchise many of us 80's and 90's children grew up with. The music has been remastered wonderfully and I haven't had any problems with the controls. It's great that they managed to get (most?) of the voice actors back, that only make's it that much more special.  The stages are mostly left the same, with minior changes to make it more action packed or intresting, I haven't had a problem with the stages, in my opinion it simply makes the whole experience more 'refreshing'.  A complaint that seemed common with people was that the cut scenes cut away from the game and while agree that sometimes there's a little bit TOO much banter interuppting gameplay, it really hasn't been a deal breaker for me and some of the major cutscenes explaining the story and situation has been nice since the original NES game didn't really do too well of a job explaning anything, not that as kids we needed it, ha ha.  To be perfectly honest, the only major grip I have is the art. The character sprites are wonderfully done, except the artists seem to neglect minor touches to the game, such as having the character's mouths move when they talk. The biggest issue I have though is that the sprites look wonderful, as if they were hand drawn and then everything else is a stagnant, ugly, pastel colored 3D rendered. The two styles class horribly and the artists who were doing the background and foreground work didn't even bother to have proper perspective when considering the sprites. In the introduction stage, doors, chairs and other background objects look to be 10 times bigger then character sprites and it's just lame and offputting.   Does that ruin the game for me? No, not really, but it is a little offputting and really made me wish they would have just went that extra mile for attention to details. All in all, I'd pick it up, especally if it's on sale.",

The music is lovingly redone from its 8-bit origins, and the gameplay feels much like it did on the NES (with the exception that the controller is larger, but that's only because I played with an XBox controller). The addition of the voice cast from the cartoon, makes for a nice touch too, as it was nice to hear them again. Made me pull out my DVD collection to watch the series again, and it the process, introduce my 2 year old daughter to the cartoon (which she now asks for all the time).  I know many had issue with the amount of cut scenes added, but I didn't find it too bad. After your first play through, simply turn off cutscenes through the options and you're good. It did find the game easier than I did the original, but I don't know if that was me remembering the NES original being harder from the mindset of my younger, early gamer years or that I've just grown better at gaming.  Overall, I'd recommend this to anyone; fan of the original cartoon or not. It's a nice bit of nostalgia for those who are and a fun, classic-styled side-scroller for all.",

It was made easier by the fluid controls - I didn't have to battle once with it, and if I remember correctly, to perform the pogo on the NES you had to push down and B, whereas on Remastered, as long as you're in the air and press B, the pogo will work. I found this very pleasant. My Xbox 360 controller worked without even having to configure it. I knew I was going to love the game as soon as I was navigating the menus using it. I've noticed a lot of negative reviews regarding the cut scenes, but I enjoyed them on my first play through. The animation and voice overs were amazing, and it followed the story from beginning to finish. It was literally like playing an interactive story of Duck Tales, not just a platformer. I heard after a recent update you can actually turn them off, but on your first run through I would recommend keeping them on just so you can see how beautiful this game really is. Great sound, great graphics, dynamic bosses with more than a single move.. this title is a must have for platform lovers and Duck Tale fans alike.

My personal recommendation is definitely get it if you want to, but I would do so while it's on sale (I've usually seen it at around $7.50); since this is a remaster of an NES game, it's fairly short, and there are not a lot of achievements (for at least the PC version). Honestly, I don't play it that much anymore, since I have all the achievements, but I definitely felt like I got my money's worth out of a trip down memory lane.

There are tons of extra unlockables like concept art and music from both the remake and the classic game.   My only minor complaint is since you can unlock art and music of the original NES game, i think it would have been an especially nice touch to be able unlock the original game itself but alas no such luck.

I understand the studio paid great money to get the voice actors and want to make sure we listen to every expensive second they recorded. When the cutscenes start you can just leve the room, make a cup of coffe, drink it, come back and maybe they are finished talking so you can continue to play. It really breaks the flow of the othervice good gameplay.  I consider the game broken compared to the NES-version due to the excessive use of cutscenes and therefore give it a thumbs down. Apparently the developers realized that the cutscenes were not improving the experience since they added an option to turn them off, but then removed that option for first time players.

Once you start it up and hear that theme song, you'll know you've done the right thing.",

There's either something inherent in these characters that Carl Barks brought to life so many years ago in his comics and graphic novels that just sucks a person by their inner 10 year old.

Definitely an easy way to approach the series at ease to all those who can't stand the NES graphics.  So if you have played the old one as a kid this will surely give you an instant 'nostalgic boner.' However there is one major flaw... It contains many, many, many cutscenes. I can't address this enough, the amount of cutscenes makes even Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns Of The Patriots look more videogameish than a movie. Okay, I may be a bit overexaggerating with that one.

The five stages from the original game are faithfully reproduced in stunning hi-res graphics, the music is a phenomenal reimagining of the original 8-bit tunes, and the addition of voice acting (by and large using the voice actors from the old Disney cartoon!) tickles the nostalgia bone on an additional level.  My only real point of complaint is the addition of a final, sixth level in which the game's end boss is found and battled. The problem lies not so much with the level itself, or even with the post-final-boss Metroid-esque escape sequence which is an incredibly unforgiving gauntlet of instant-death hazards that requires both memorization and reflexes to pass. No, the problem is that losing all of your lives during that escape sequence kicks the player right back to the beginning of the final stage, forcing him or her to slog through its entirety again. It struck me as unfun padding in an otherwise tight, high-quality game.  That said, DuckTales: Remastered is a great nostalgia kick for people who grew up playing the original NES game, and it is overall put together quite well. Players who did not grow up on the original, however, might be put off by its comparatively short length, but anyone looking for a fun platforming romp should enjoy the game.",

I think this game captures the essence of the original and updates it for a modern audience while retaining what made the original game special.  You can look at this game in two distinct ways; either in the context of the original game/show or outside that context.   Looking at it simply as a platform game, I think it is great! It relies on a pogo jump mechanic which is really satisfying and leads to interesting, unique level design. It is definitely a bit cutscene-heavy, but all cinematics can be skipped (but if you're a fan of the show you wouldn't want to - more on that later). At first, I felt like the movement speed was a tad too slow, but I got used to it, and the levels are designed with this speed in mind. The challenge has been ramped up compared to the original, which I can appreciate; it makes it feel as difficult as the original did when I played it as a kid. I particularly like how all the bosses have expanded move sets to make the battles more difficult and unpredictable. Overall, it is a bright, colorful and fun game which appeals to adults and children alike; the music stands out as particularly good. Jake Kaufman (Shovel Knight) did a fantastic job adapting the themes from the original, which leads me to the other way of looking at the game: in the context of the DuckTales franchise.  The primary demographic for this game definitely seems to be people who grew up watching the show, and as a piece of fan servive, it does not disappoint. It has tons of unlockable concept art, sketches etc. which can be tedious to unlock (you use the gold you pick up in-game to 'buy' the art), but is a nice touch. You can go into the money bin and dive into the pile of money, just like in the intro to the show; this has no gameplay function and they did not have to put it in, but it feels really good!   Like I mentioned above, the game is cutscene-heavy, but the team managed to bring back all the original voice cast from the show (some, sadly, for the last time), and it is a joy to be able to experience what is essentially an episode of the show again. The story expands on the thread-bare story from the original game, and concludes with a new level (with AMAZING original music) instead of going straight into the final boss battle after finishing all the levels.  Something that struck me while playing this game is that it might serve as a conversation starter between my generation and the next. This is a game I could see parents playing with their children, which can lead to them exploring the DuckTales TV show (which totally holds up, by the way), but might also spark a conversation about how gaming used to look like; who knows, maybe this game is a gateway to the old NES classics?  I can highly recommend this game to anyone who doesn't mind getting their nostalgia played like a ukulele; as a game it is competent, challenging and fun, but as a piece of fan service and a nod to times gone by, it can be something really special.",

Either way, I loved this game- I was a big fan of it on the NES, and this remake does it great justice. Hand-painted animated sprites mixed with good looking 3-d backgrounds, great score, old-school difficulty, and possibly best of all, the original voice actors from the TV show (except Gizmoduck, whose VA died before the game...Ducktales Remastered is also the last project that the VA for Scrooge did before his death as well).   Definitely worth a go, but maybe wait til a sale, just in case the Crash Boogeyman decides to get you.",
