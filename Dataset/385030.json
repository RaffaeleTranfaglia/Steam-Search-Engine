            "review_text": "This is a fabulous game. I first played C KANE in its mobile release early last year (before the debut of Undertale, for those making that comparison!). Graphically simple, but the sneaky writing and weirdo music were A+ stuff. I'm happy to report that this update is every bit as clever, with some genuinely poignant twists. And it doubles the content to boot! As for gameplay, the mechanics are deceptively simple -- there are more tactical possibilities hidden in here than in most modern, big-name RPGs. The battles are 100% scripted (no random encounters), so the game is polished, fast, and fun, without any of the grind and bloat that still seem to plague the genre. Great stuff!",
