I can't walk through water, which you start right next to in the beginning of the game, because I'll be swimming the entire game. Even when I'm on land my character is swimming and is much slower. Sprinting doesn't seem to be any faster than walking, although that could again be due to the bugs. The game seems interesting but with all the bugs there's no way for me to really know.",
