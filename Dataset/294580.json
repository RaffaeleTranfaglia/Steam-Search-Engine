            "review_text": "Overall I would give this game a 7/10. It is more like a DLC, however. I recommend turning down your headphones before launching the game, as the audio is loud. The opening cinamatic sets up an interesting plot, when Luther falls into a cave as him and Freddi are out on a picnic. The graphics are really great, I'd say they are even as good, or better, than Battlefield 4's graphics. One of the complaints I have is that the backgrounds rarely changed, I finally got a new background 20 levels into the game!. Another complaint would be the option to cheat easily. At any point in the game you can just hover your mouse near the bottom of your screen to have a cheat menu to appear. Turning these on might be a good idea to get a general feel for the game, but I highly recommend turning them off once you get use to the controls since the cheats greatly take away from the games difficulty and enjoyment. I also feel like this game is just a cash-grab from the devs. I say this because you seldom, if at all, get to see the main character we all know and love; Freddi the fish. Hopefully with the upcoming 'Dragon's Teeth' DLC we will be able to have more weapons, vehicles, enemies and more realistic, detailed NPCs.",
