            "review_text": "I enjoyed this game greatly! The combat was simple but challenging, that said though it took a good 2/3 of the game to actually get hard. The difficulty spike is obvious at the second to last Jotun as I had a lot of trouble with him and the one after. The final boss was quite brutal as well, but I like challenge. The story was very nice and detailed and I loved how the camera panned out so you could see different things in the background.  The game is short though. If you aren't going for 100% run or achievements on steam it can be beaten in about 3-4 hours. I would not justify the price of 15e for such a short expirience how fancy it happens to be with its art style. That said I would recommend getting this game on sale as it's a really fun game and nice change from most games these days.   Now to just wait for more games from these guys... I have my eye on you!",

            "review_text": "What frustrates me the most about Jotun is how agonizingly close it is to being an excellent game. The assets are there. Just something went wrong.  In Jotun, you play as Thora, a Viking warrior who was drowned, and now is set on the path to defeat several giants known as jotun to impress the Gods, so that you may be accepted in Valhalla. It's a neat concept for a game, and the Norse Mythology theming is wonderful. Much of the lore is integrated into the game's environment, and I found myself learning a bit about the mythology.  Thora herself feels pretty damn good. Her movement and attacks are slow, but this is to encourage a deliberate playstyle; she feels very weighty. Her moveset is basic: a roll, a light and heavy attack. You also collect some power-ups to aid you. The massive jotun fights are the focus of the game, with short exploration segments prior, giving the player some nice quiet time. The fights are intense, grand, quite difficult, and definitely enjoyable. I genuinely found myself wanting to replay some of these fights even after I finished the game.  The presentation of the game is top notch. The hand drawn visuals are wonderfully animated, and each Jotun has it's own distinct style, most of which are really killer (one or two are not my style, but that's preference). Thora's sprites look gorgeous. A lot of care has been put into the visuals. The music is excellent as well, ranging from ambient, to somber, to bombastic. Some tracks really stick out here. The sound design is pretty effective as well, and the dialogue spoken in the character's native tongue really adds a lot, as well as being excellently delivered by her voice actress.   That's all great. So what went wrong?  There are a few things. The game has a nasty habit of breaking immersion. Some of the UI seems out of place for the theming, and all the areas are disconnected from each other in a hub area. The game world doesn't feel cohesive, instead feeling like a series of levels to complete, rather than a living world. The aforementioned lore, too, also doesn't feel as 'alive' as it should, with certain aspects of the mythology just plopping themselves in. You very rarely encounter smaller enemies, so everytime you do, it feels very awkward. The backtracking can be frustrating often because of the size of some of these environments, and the speed of your character. Often, the game will pretty much just tell you what to do explicitly, and this really hurts the game. No longer do I feel like a sick viking adventurer, instead, a person playing a game in a chair, being told what boxes to check in order to progress. All this and a dissapointing final boss battle, whose design is the least interesting in the game (really?) takes this game from an 'awesome' to a 'pretty good'.   I want this game to be good. I desperately want this game to be better than it is. Allow me to clarify: Jotun is definitely a good game. I am recommending it, albeit tentatively, after all. I love the feeling and aesthetic of the majority of this game. It's just a shame there are blemishes throughout which make it, all together, just pretty good.",

I couldn't afford it at full price at first but now it's in my steam library.  IT'S WORTH IT. BUY IT!  This game is legit in it's boss fights.  It shines in these moments so brightly that it hurts. Even the quieter ones, where you are able to discover a huge hand-drawn  world based in norse mythology, give you enough breathing space  that you are only distracted by the art style, the enviroment design and  the smooth animation of the characters and enviroments.  Even still, this game is not perfect.  With a minimalistic storytelling and not that much collectibles or items per level, for some players the game will feel empty and aimless.  But man...if you are in for some crazy boss fights, stunning animated art style, amazing enviroments with  an effective and misterious soundtrack and visual/gameplay narrative  a la Shadow of the Colossus, you will love it.

            "review_text": "I have to say, even though I've not finished the game yet, which I will update and give a post review, so far, this game is seriously beautiful all around. Very gorgeous scenery, the story so far is very engaging and very intriguing, the controls are not hard to learn, but it takes a good amount of skill and know how in order to not take damage. The game itself is a puzzle/maze when it comes to trying to find everything you are looking for, so for those perfectionists out there, look everywhere lol. The other mesmerizing feature of this game is the soundtrack. I really love it, and it makes me want to purchase it on a future timeframe, but it really adds to the game itself. Along with the storyline, it is narrated in it's native language (though it does have english subtitles), which makes the game even more amazing. So far, so good. I can't wait to see the rest of this game. My score so far 8/10 in general.  Update!: Now that I have finished the game, my review still stands on all that I have mentioned on my earlier review in regards to the game's features and such. It gets even more challenging on the later levels (as it should) and as much frustration sets in on how some of the bosses are harder, you still feel as though you are Thora in wanting to fight on to finally impress all of the gods in the end. I give this game a 9/10. I can only imagine how the Valhalla mode is like. I do recommend this game for anyone who loves story rich games.",

The only things I don't like about it are that the map doesn't desplay where you are in relation to the area so you have to use general context clues (like which side of the map and where you can't go) to figure out where you are; also, you don't have an AOE attack so I found the 2nd boss fight especially aggrivating. But other than those 2 things, its a great game. Not sure if its worth 15$ but worth every dollar if you get it durring a sale",

This game is great for the family as the violence is also very cartoonish with no blood.  It's a short game but worth every penny spent. Just think of it on terms of going to the movies except this experience will feel truly unique! 9.5/10 when you factor in the price tag.

(I dont)      The Good Side:  The game is handrawn and looks prety, The game has an extraordinarily rich storyline, The Bosses called 'Jotuns' have an engaging sequence of moves with incredible animations, In the Game you will find severald cool upgrades such as gold apple that extend you health meter, For those gamers who usualy play a mage in games you can discover several lore friendly spells called 'god powers' The different feature are very well imported and fit in with the theme of Norse Mytholigy, This is not a game you will play and beat the game in seconds most enemeys will either kill you once and then you will think about putting together a stratagy to beat them or you will think of a strategy in the middle of battle, Some of the enemeys are fantasticly well made and programmed perfectly.  My farorite bit:  I have experienced not a single Bug or Glitch   Overall:  If you are a fan of these kinds of games play this game straight away.",

            "review_text": "Not your typical Hack n Slash. On the contrary, Jotun is a beautiful game with hand crafted backgrounds that really make you think you're tiny. Basically the game challenges you to complete 5 zones with 2 levels and 1 boss each. The levels are usually constructed maze like. Your goal is to find the 'boss runes' to unlock the area's boss. You can also find 'skill runes' that give you certain power ups to use during combat (limited use), 'refreshing pools' that refresh your life and power-ups (only once per activation) and 'hidden golden apples' that permanently increase your life. Skill runes include healing, invincibility, faster running, distraction clone, increased melee damage and homing arrows.  Once you have used up all your power-ups they will be unavailable until you hit a new fountain or until you defeat a boss (or are defeated by a boss). Sames goes for your life bar. The levels themselves usually do not involve a lot of enemies, if at all. Mostly you will be fighting elemental hazards, like lava, lightning, cave-ins or big birds that swoop down from time to time, amongst others. This makes the game very unique, but those looking for a combat focussed gameplay should veer clear of this one, because you will not be fighting a lot.  Speaking of fighting, you only have 2 attacks anyway. A low damage quick attack and a high damage (veeeery) slow attack that can be cancelled by you or by taking damage. The combat really isn't what makes this game great...outside of the bosses there's just too little to do in that regard.  The bosses themselves are gigantic Jotun, Norse giants so to speak. Each boss has its own attack patterns and stages. So the lower health a boss gets the more difficult it becomes for you to defeat him. You have to learn the attacks and know when to pop you power-ups to go for the kill. They are extremely fun, but can be a bit frustrating at times. Technically you can also gather all world power ups including health before engaging any one of the bosses. They do not give you special drops or powers or whatever, however. After you defeat the 5 area bosses Odin awaits you.  The music, the art style and the Norse narrator are what make this game great. It's not very long. I got about 4 to 5 hours in and I've not rushed through it, but explored every nook and cranny. You are paying for a nice theme and an artistic vision rather than a game with deep gameplay. If that is worth the full asking price to you, has to be your decision. For me, unfortunately, it's not, since there are just too many games out there and Jotun in my opinion is not worth more than maybe 5-10 bucks at most in such a competitive land scape. I'm nevertheless glad that I played it.",

            "review_text": "Jotun has been a very enjoyable experience. Combining exploration, some basic puzzle elements, authentic Icelandic voiceovers, and some epic, methodical boss battles, Jotun is well worth the price tag. However, it is critical to note that it is very deliberately paced.  Thora, the main character, is a powerful Viking warrior swinging a giant axe and she moves how you might expect ... moderate walk speed and slow, powerful attacks, making the Jotun battles more about tactics and positioning over raw reflexes and button-mashing (though reflexes do not hurt!). Also, the deliberate pace carries through the non-boss levels, with a premium on exploration, beautiful vistas, and atmosphere over constant combat. In most levels, the greatest dangers are environmental and the simple challenge of puzzling through the area to find both the rune to advance and each power-up.  The art and graphics require a special shout-out. The hand-drawn art is beautiful and perfectly matches the gameplay and story feel. The giant enemies feel impactful and unique, Thora moves and animates beautifully, the backgrounds are lovely, and the team's interpertation of the Norse gods is great.  Jotun is a relatively short playthrough (about 6 hours for me with full exploration and at most 4 tries per boss) but it was a very engaging playthrough. For the $15 price, that's plenty of entertainment for me, plus the developers are adding a New Game+ (supposedly later this year) to add extended gameplay value.  To sum up: Potential Pros:  + Beatiful hand-drawn art  + Methodical (if simple) combat system that rewards tactics  + Great, simple controls (using controller)  + Challenging giant bosses  + Great atmosphere and story with real Icelandic voice-overs (the closest modern language to how Vikings spoke)  Potential Cons:  - Slow pace of exploration and action (might turn off some)  - Relatively short total playtime (4 to 6 hours at current)",

Positives: -The attention to detail is incredible! 99% of this game looks like it was hand drawn by brilliant artists because it was -Visually stunning, the establishing shots that are scattered throughout the different areas really makes you feel like you're part of a bigger, more mystical, world -The music is awesome; epic and intense when appropriate and ominous when it needs to be, and very well composed with action-sensitive crossfades so you're never taken out of your immersion  -The gameplay is as solid as a rock with plenty of variety of puzzles, terrain, level design, power ups, and enemies -The hit detection is excellent. You never take damage unless you should take damage and the enemies get the same treatment. If you want to beat this game and are having trouble, just get good. -The difficulty is pretty high in some parts, but fairly forgiving with deaths. As it should be in an action-adventure game.  Negatives: -In the first area (Niflheim) Yggdrassil's roots are very pixelated. This is the only time in the game that I've seen this and I'm surprised it got past the alpha stage. Not really a big deal, it just looks weird. -When you stand behind something it's difficult to see yourself. You can still see Thora's silhouette, but in the darker areas you can get lost for a few seconds, which is a bit annoying. If your silhouette was a bit brighter when you walked behind something(light gray instead of dark gray) it would remedy this -The map is great, but Thora's current position doesn't appear on it. It's not too difficult to figure out where you are, but it slows down the gameplay everytime you consult your map and need to double check your surroundings. Especially in a game that encourages exploration.   Overall I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes adventuring, Norse mythology, and a combination of both. Also to the gamers out there looking for a challenge, the bosses in this game DO NOT JOKE AROUND. Be prepared to get owned a few times, I sure as hell know I did. I had a great time with this game and am looking forward to seeing more from Thunder Lotus Games in the future.",

It has a lot of replay value considering all the achievements will have you play it in many different ways.  If you're a bit into Norse Mythology it's really nice to see how accurate the game is, and if you're not you feel the urge to check it out.  I would buy it again, I would offer it to people, I would preach its beauty on the internet.  Amazing music, Amazing graphics, Amazing story. Amazing game.",

Almost every boss is well designed and tests what you've learned from each level with the exception of the final boss.  I won't spoil it but I found the final boss to be more annoying than challenging, though I did give up on beating it simply due to how frustrating and uninspired it is compared to the other bosses who were quite a delight to behold and fight.  A wonderful game with a sweeping series of high notes but a rather mediocre and dull final note, but all in all do recommend and well worth the time and money.",

If you loved shadow of the colossus which unfortunately I have never played, you will probably like this game. The art is beautiful to look at and all hand drawn. The game is a master of scaling, and does not only an excelling job of making you feel small, but also of making the enemies feel big. The Jotnar can travel across the map in a few steps while you slowly try and catch up. Each boss battle is unique as each jotun uses a different element. The puzzles are not the hardest in the world, but the real challange if you like exploration as I do. The map you can pull up does not tell you where you are on the map, so you have to use geographical features to juxtapose yourself onto the map. One final note. While most levels do not involve combat, the boss battles are extremely challanging. I give jotun a solid 8/10",

That's not to say the game's a walk in the park-easy, it's just that the game knows its strengths and how to build itself around them.  Highly recommend if you're a fan of atmospheric adventure-type games, you'll get more than your money's worth.",

            "review_text": "I doubt any dissenters to the notion that video games are ostensibly a form of art exist within the video game hoi polloi anymore. To those self aggrandizing cultural stalwarts who are - I present to you Jotun, the latest in an exponentially increasing list of beautifully crafted indie darlings that strengthen the art argument just about monthly.   Jotun's story is that of our heroine, a viking woman named Thora, who's life ends unceremoniously in a storm. Unable to ascend unto the halls of Valhalla, Thora must garner the reverence of the Norse gods to secure her rightful place in Asgard, all the while revealing the story of her life in pieces along the way. Thora's life is fraught with Shakespearean tragedy, told in a fashion which is somehow both autobiographical and eulogistic. Developer Thunder Lotus Games out of Montreal couples this with a hauningly minimalist landscape and score, and has created a deeply moving experience.  The gameplay of Jotun is deceptively simple. There are no enemies besides the bosses which the player only encounters by gathering the necessary runes from their respective area. Exploring these areas was an incredibly joyous experience for a very unique reason; the area maps are purposefully vague and do not show your location. The game remedies this in very realistic ways like zooming the camera out when you're on high ground, giving you a better lay of the land and forcing the player to navigate using a form of dead reckoning. Not all will find this as endearing as I did, but I found it added a layer of realism and difficulty to getting around and, at the very least, gives you a much better appreciation of the level design. Boss battles are the classic 'notice a pattern and counter accordingly, using the abilities you've acquired thus far' but, in practice, are not so patronizingly easy and in fact can be quite the opposite.   Jotun is everything from beautiful to terrifying to heartbreakingly tragic. The gameplay, art style, and score are resonant and powerful, and the difficulty and learning curve are just right, meaning Jotun feels something like the perfect mix of Dark Souls, Shadow of the Colossus, and Transistor. Jotun could benefit from a length increase, but then again, so could most artsy indie games, and even though I found it's unique take on navigation to be charming, there was a definite need for a mini map, as I found myself pressing start just about every 2 minutes to look at it. Jotun is a fun game that is presented well enough to make you feel feelings and think thoughts which, at the end of the day, is a definition of art. Don't expect Jotun to change the way video games are perceived tomorrow, but absolutely include it in the list of games that will change that perception in a few years.",

The audio is powerful and while not crucial to play, it's certainly greatly enhancing the feel of the game. It's nicely paced and handles subtle clues like a boss. While the game is not too hard, it's not too easy either.  Battling against the game's bosses feel lovely. They all have diverse and interesting mechanics, with multiple tiers of skillsets and behaviours, which made me excited to see what new challenge I'd be facing at several stages during the fights themselves. The bosses are presented in lovely manners as well.  A beautifully wrapped package of a game. Thanks for the great entertainment!",

The Bad:  Other than reassigning the keys on the keyboard, there is nothing that is displeasing playing this game.  Overall:  Pick it up.

The puzzles are not very tricky but somewhat good. The game however has it's focus on the boss fights. The biggest problem with the boss fights are that they aren't that tricky. The times I had a problem, it was because I couldn't see myself or the fact that the controls can be slightly slow on reacting. The fighting feels stiff and awkward. This is on purpose I think to make the fights more focused on timing rather than mashing a button. I think this is a good choice but it does feel a bit off at times. Making it as previously stated, stiff and awkward.  The looks are good but the pictures give you a sense of hugeness that is not there the same way “in game”. They do however have some great visual moments. One such occasion is when you can see a big statue in the distance, way bellow you and it turns out to be the boss. COOL!  The game is short and they try to elongate this by having trophies that are like: kill boss without taking any dam. This is for some people but not me and I think not for most.  I do not regret buying this game and it isn't bad. Not bad does unfortunately not mean recommended in my book. Now this thumbs down is to be honest, slightly harsh and if you are on the edge of should I or should I not, then buy it on sale. At the end of it all though, I can't recommend it.",

The Graphics and art style in general is pretty good, however certain things lack the detail of the backgrounds and the bosses are animated at a much lower frame rate than the rest which is unfortunate but not a deal breaker.   The main issue is that outside of the boss fights the game just isnt very fun. There are a number of extremely simple puzzles that just take a bit too much time to do leading to a plodding pace with no real challenge. For example in the lightning area you need to hit objects to draw lines in order to make constelations, however none of these are particularly challenging and the slow movement speed of the character just left it feeling a bit tedious to complete the puzzles, another area takes place on a tree where the only thing you need to do is walk along amiring the pretty background and pressing heavy attack when you see a specific type of branch.  The boss fights I experienced in my time however felt much better, but not good enough to warrant the boring filler between them.",
