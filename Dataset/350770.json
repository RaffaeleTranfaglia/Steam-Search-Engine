I never would have thought it possible in this era of gaming!",

            "review_text": "Giana Sisters 2D may seem like the kind of simple little platformer you'd sit down and enjoy for an evening or two from the videos and screenshots, but a myriad of bugs and awful hit detection make the game more of a waste and not really even worth checking out for fans of the original game.   Bugs encountered in just 44 minutes of playing stages 1-1 through 3-9 include:  -The game's hit detection is garbage, plain and simple.  -The scoring system is ENTIRELY busted. I started the game with 116,000,000 points for whatever reason, and the game's intro stage seems to just cut off completely at random. -Stage Intro Cards displaying the next ordered stage (from 1-1 to 1-2 for instance) but the game repeating the stage you just finished. -Spawning incorrectly inside geometry and other objects after death or starting a stage. The game ejects the character from said geometry and drops them off the screen to their death. Repeat until Game Over.  -The game stops receiving input from the player whenever a new stage is started, respawning at a checkpoint, or taking a hit as the Punk sister. Your input stops completely and you have to re-press the direction you were headed.   Honestly, grab Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams instead. It's a much more modern take on the series and, unlike this rushed out, cheap, and bug-ridden mess, does the original game some justice while modernizing it in ways that make sense.   Giana Sisters 2D is just a shoddy hack job with little to no care put into creating a game/product that functions well enough to be playable, let alone enjoyable.",
