After  the massive reset that restarted the data in all the servers  [www.zezeniaonline.com]  and after the lack of significant updates, I posted a few of feedback posts in one of the patch announcements in the official forum, only to be banned for 9 years right after by K-Zodron (the developer) for 'destructive behavior'. Currently, when I try to login with my account, I find out that has been deleted.  Conclusion: do not take this game seriously, it is the side-project of a developer that treat their playerbase like toys.",

            "review_text": "When I saw Zezenia Online in Steam, I knew that I have to download this. I am an old tibia player and Zezenia brang me the fun back again. Be sure, to read the whole review, before reading any other short reviews with bad informations.  I began Zezenia Online at 6th August. I am writing this review on 24th August. Right now I played Zezenia for 252 Hours, Lvl 85 Barbarian and some other Chars 50+.  Pros: - Graphical like Tibia, Gameplay has its own feeling, the Game is only inspired by Tibia and not the same - 4 continents, big and large map - Multiple Mobspawns of the same monsters - Housing System - Gathering &amp; Brew-system - Much spells - 3 Classes incl. 7 subclasses - No Level-Cap - Speedrate Server for those, who wants to level as fast as in known MMOs - Party system - Ingame Auctionhouse (Market) - Talentsystem for points got by level ups - Guild / Guildwar system - You don't have to buy Premium in order to enjoy the game - Premium can be bought for not much farmed gold coins, without paying real money - Duel arenas - much much more content and mysteries  Cons: - Hard to get informations about the game, during the only informations can be found on fansites - not much quests - it seems like the mainlanguage there is brasilian or portuguese instead of english - support channel is nice, but even not, if no one takes a second to answer a simple question - PVP World = Get banished after 6 Kills on 1 Day (unjustified PVP Combat), good for massacres, but is that even still pvp experience? - small community  But I tell you something. I love Zezenia and I will play the next hundred hours shortly!",
