If you want to see more in this review series, check out my Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet Review.  I bought this game when it was first released into early access. It looked like a promising idea, but I have been wrong on that before, so I was wary of this game being updated. To be honest, it wasn't the best when I first got it. I played for about an half an hour before I finished everything the game had to offer, then I just kindof forgot about it. When I found it again, it was updated and out of early access, and it opened up to a whole new menu. I played just the 'Story' mode, which isn't much of a story, but does have a great soundtrack and gameplay. It does have a small learning curve, which I actually like in most games, so it didn't turn me off from it. I overall love this game in it's current state, and I hope the devs keep up the good work, and keep updating it!  tl;dr I like this game as it is now, and I also love the soundtrack.  Pros: + Great Soundtrack + Love the 'Reprogrammable Blocks' + New and innovative idea  Cons: - Almost no story - Small learning curve  8/10  [EDIT: Changed my grammar.]",

The full version, which was released a couple of weeks ago, has greatly expanded on the promise of the early access versions.  There's no story to speak of, just pure puzzles within the 'object manipulation' environment. Very enjoyable.",

This game is a very fun game and i urge you to play it. the only thing that i an kinda sad about is that the old version was removed in alpha 2.2.   ---------------DEVELOPERS OF THE GAME SECTION----------------- Developers, can you add a alpha 2.1 beta branch? i really miss the old version and i bet others do too. no need to update it because its only for Alpha 2.1. thanks, and i understand if you cannot.   RATING: 10/10 ",

Besides a few minor glitches and confusing parts the learning curve is unique and makes for an addicting game. As for the mechanics this game style has a LOT of potential with strategy, using physics and logic, and even stories could be developed around the style. I praise this game and hope more like it will soon become popular!",

            "review_text": "Glitchspace was an interesting 44 minutes. I could not take more than that. Terrible, changing mouse response and delayed cursor interaction lead me to become somewhat physically sick. In this game there are two primary modes of involvement with objects and environment, and each has a seperate feel. In editing your objects, you have a highly delayed, unresponsive, mush of a mouse cursour, and in gameplay you have a snappy, quite overly responsive mouse feel. I attempted to rectify and make this game playable by hot switching dpi from my mouse's built in dpi selection buttons. This was not a good solution for any sort of enjoyable gameplay. In the editing mode you will literally move the mouse, and then watch it trail behind it's intended path, delayed by some time, making editing quite annoying. In game settings do little to cope with this. The game does run at very high frame rates, which is nice. The environment is stark, yet beautiful in places. The concept is amazing. But I cannot play this game...ever again due to nausea. And I haven't had game induced stomach-turn since playing Metroid on NES around 1992. The mouse behavior ruined this game for me, and I really did want to like this one.",

            "review_text": "A very creative and interesting puzzle game. The core mechanic allows you to manipulate objects in the game using rudimentary programming functions and logic. This is primarily utilized in various platforming puzzles, requiring you to move objects into favorable positions, make objects apply force to launch the player, etc. The game presents a good progression of complexity and does a good job of both teaching and challenging the player. Some of the puzzles required very topsy turvy thinking. Overall it's a very creative and interesting puzzle experience.   The most obvious complaint for this game is that it is a bit short. The 'story' mode is only about three hours long, and unfortunately feels like it ends just as it's starting to get devilishly complex. Additionally I encountered a few physics glitches which messed up my attempted solutions for puzzles a few times, but I would imagine most of these will be fixed in future patches.  Overall a fun, creative, if somewhat short puzzle game. Definitely deserves a lot of credit for that creativity though.",

            "review_text": "I've seen a fair share of games give said player the ability to 'code' certain block or areas to let you progress further in the game, but I've never seen a game such as Glitchspace do it so well.  The game in itself has a sort of atmosphere to it, and delievers more than just a simple 'This goes there and this goes here', and it will let you get lost in it's atmosphere if you let it. The atmosphere kind of feels like those side levels in Assassin's Creed 2(I think), where you collect a certain amount of fragments, you go back to the isalnd, and you enter these portals that take you in a clean, crisp, and Sci-fy type of feel. Anyways, away from the atmosphere, the game is a first person puzzle game, and if you don't know how to code so well, then you may be stuck on some puzzles for awhile. The game gives you certain abilities for your, what the game calls a 'toolbox', that you are going to unlock and use later down the line, ranging from timers to impact force. I'm not a paragraph man, I'm a bullet man, so let's get into listing some Pros and Cons, shall we?  Pros: + Has a very atmopsheric feel to it. + If you don't know how to code, you can get a feel for it here, and if you do know how to code, this can help you, I guess. + A very easy game to pick up and put down, there is no rush. + Has some amazing music tracks and sound effects. + Leaves you with a sense of mystery of what goal your working toward and why your doing it, which is the kind of stuff I like. + Has very low graphic demands but still delivers what it needs to. + Has a compass which tells you which direction your facing, which comes into play way more than I'd like to give it credit for figuring out which way I'm facing and how to code said block. + Has a simple GUI for coding said blocks.  Cons: - The atmosphere can easily be broken because some puzzle leave you with little to no information on what to do. - Later in the game, you get the ability to place down your own platforms, which means if you get stuck on a puzzle, you can place a platform down and cheap your way through some puzzles in the game, which I have had to do atleast 3 or 4 times out of the 40ish puzzles I've completed. This once again leaves you with a feeling of unfulfillment and/or an unfinished game, which disconnects you from the atmosphere. - The coding GUI has an annoying expansion system, you click on a box, a sub-unit of boxes expands around where you clicked said box, making it a bit annoying if your trying to speed through a puzzle. - For being on sale for $7 bucks when I got this, I'd honestly say that the game isn't worth the $13 or so bucks that it ask for normally. The game idea just isn't fleshed out enough or the game just doesn't expand on it's core features enough to be worth it.   Overall, I'd personally say that the game is worth getting, but if your a cheap ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ like me, wait for it to be on sale.",
