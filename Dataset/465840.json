            "review_text": "EDIT: Something I forgot to select when posting my review was that I was given a copy, not by the devs but by a reviewer group I only recently met, for the purpose of review. It was a month since I got the key, but I felt writing this in for full disclosure.  If you grew up during the late '90s, early 2000s, then the name SNK has little to no bearing on you as much as other fighting-game names—and that's a damn shame. History has often forgotten gems not because they lacked quality but they were behind the times, and The Last Blade was most certainly an aging, though strong, relic.   Beneath the quarter-eating exterior of arcade machines that we may liken to modern microtransactions without the nostalgia were games that provided short, worthwhile experience with every coin thrown away. TLB was one of those unexpected gems of the distilled greatness of SNK like Shock Troopers, King of Fighters and Metal Slug with its own unique style of 2D pixel-art presentation.   Now you can replay this forgotten gem without the constant gouging of your wallet, though you certainly are getting what you paid for with this game as well as every other SNK game available by DotEmu.
