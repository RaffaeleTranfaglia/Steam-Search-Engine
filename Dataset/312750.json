            "review_text": "What you should know:   1. Non-battle gameplay is locked at 30 fps. Battle's are locked at 15 fps. This is because the PC version is based on the Android port that is based on the DS port. Kind of like an emulation. The 15 fps isn't too debilitating given this is a turn based game but there is noticable input lag that can be annoying and the animation looks stiff.  2. I tested resolutions from 1920 x 1080 all the way down to 800 x 600 and you really don't notice much of a difference in game. The textures up close (usually during cutscenes) look terrible and neither an increase nor a decrease in resolution seemed to help much at all. 1080p DOES however make the excellent FMV's look even more stunning. Seriously, those are friggin beautiful.  3. The game itself has really hooked me so far. Cecil is way more interesting then any other protaganist I have played as in quite some time. Really makes you wonder how SE could have screwed up so badly with the more recent iterations of Final Fantasy. For some reason, I never got around to playing this even though I've played every other FF that's come stateside and am really glad I picked this one up.  As I have not played any other version of this game I can't give a good comparison review to other versions. The good is the game itself is great and looks pretty great most of the time. I enjoy the story and despite the 15 fps lock in battle after you get used to it it's not a big deal HOWEVER, If you port a game to PC it's pretty inexcusable to lock framerates so low. As PC gamers, we want to play the game as silky smooth as possible and I can understand why people are upset about this. Hopefully someone can mod this quickly.   All in all, I'm glad I purchased this game. I can finally play the FF most people praise as the best one ever made. So far, this game really delivers and I'm having a-lot of fun. Take care all I will update my review if I have any further info or thoughts on the game as I continue playing. Peace!",

            "review_text": "There's a TL;DR at the end.  Final Fantasy IV was originally released as Final Fantasy II (FFII and III did not come to the US and places outside of Japan at first. This made numbering confusing for a while, especially since FFV skipped over us too) for the SNES. People evidently liked it so much that it now has 9 different versions, from DS to PSP, GBA, iOS, PS1...  The point is, people *love* this game. A lot.  Before I proceed to rip this game a new one, know that I also *love* FFIV, and have beaten it multiple times on other platforms. I love almost every single version I own (DS, PSP, SNES, and of course PC), but I do *not* love this version, hence the thumbs-down. It changes and removes too much for me to love it. For example:  -I rather liked Whyt, an Eidolon summon unique to the DS version, and the minigames associated with it. They took them out.  -Instead of just talking to the aforementioned Whyt in order to get the Piercing Magic Augment, you now get to do a fetch quest. Yay! (sarcasm)  -They removed one of the Limit Break augments (abilities you can use on characters as items and equip). See, FFIV DS and the various ports of it have you run through the game up to 3 times, and you can get most augments more than once as a result. However, after a certain level (like 71?) your stat gains are dependent on augments equipped. If I remember right, the removal of a Limit Break forces you to change your strategy to get all characters max stats as well as have a viable strategy to fight a secret boss. That's annoying, and I don't know why they did that. Sure, you can add it back in with Cheat Engine, but you shouldn't have to.  -They took out Edward's commentaries (a character I grew fond of) from the music box. It was a nice touch, and I rather liked it, seeing as how *SPOILERS* after a certain point in the game, you really don't see much of him anymore. *END SPOILERS*  -They changed the Developer's Room. Instead of the NPCs representing the DS staff (you know, the guys who actually made the game and didn't just port and butcher it. The guys we actually care about), we instead get representations of the mobile staff. Also, there are no more treasure chests in the room, and that makes me sad.  -I know you might think the last two points are just nitpicking, but really, it's like being used to getting cupcakes with sprinkles for dessert every month, and then suddenly you get a plain muffin. These little things added charm to the game. They are the frosting and sprinkles.  The only positives about this version are the slightly (very slightly) improved visuals and framerate, and achievements. The framerate in battle, despite technically being higher/better than in the DS version, still bothers me, as it is capped to 15fps. I wasn't as bothered by the choppiness in the DS version, likely due to the smaller screen.  -Now, the actual game itself is good. You can't go wrong with FFIV. It has an ATB system (this is the game that introduced it!) where you have gauges that slowly fill up and allow you to do an action with that character once their ATB gauge is full. If you set the battle system to 'Active' in the options, enemies will attack you even while you're selecting spells or items, which forces you to think on your feet. The ATB makes the game feel dynamic, as opposed to static like FFIII and earlier.  -There's also plenty of unique equipment you can get throughout the game, particularly the incredibly rare and hard (tedious) to get Onion equipment and other equipment added in this version. Only equipment equipped to your hands will show up on your character, for better or for worse. Still, the equipment that does show up looks cool, and the various special effects are exciting.  -The visuals are great, and will not make your eyes bleed like other DS games. Some people hate the slightly chibi art style, but I think it works rather well. FFIV DS has colorful and pleasing visuals, and this version is no different!  -The OST is amazing. The tracks do a good job of not only setting the mood, but getting an emotional reaction out of the player. Since FFIV DS was my first experience with FFIV, I decided to listen to the original OST to see how different it was, and they seemed to have stayed very faithful. I'm impressed, since usually remakes butcher/change the OST so much it becomes unrecognizeable. Here, it seems like they made higher quality versions of each track, which is what every remake should do, provided that the OST was already good in the original.  - (some minor spoilers about the plot here) The plot is not necessarily completely original, but it doesn't need to be. It's still unique enough that I care about it. It could be the world that it's set in, how strange and mysterious the world is, but the plot itself is still entertaining. Fetching crystals, conspiracies about the king, the main protagonist's girlfriend getting captured...nothing original, yet it's endearing anyways.  -The characters, like the plot, aren't original, but you still might find yourself caring about them. The voice acting is likely the reason for this, as while the voice acting is so Shakespearian you might cringe, you find that you like it anyways. It's like how the VA in Castlevania: Symphony of the Night is so bad, yet it has charm because of it. You have your angsty ninja, somewhat tsundere summoner girl, pretty/feminine white mage who also happens to be the main protag's girlfriend...again, they aren't exactly unique, but they are lovable.  -The previously mentioned augment system was introduced with the DS version. How it works is that at certain points in the game, places or people will have abilities that you can receive from them and put on other party members. Once you use an augment on a party member, there's no taking it back unless you reset. You may take it out of their command menu so that it doesn't show up in battle, but you cannot assign that ability to another party member, unless you get another copy of said augment and use it on them. Now, previously unique abilities like Yang's Focus can be applied to someone like Kain or Cecil. While this is a good thing, it has some major drawbacks. You can miss certain augments. Also, if you forget to obtain some augments or don't find them before you beat the game once and go onto your New Game Plus, you're forever screwed out of that copy of that augment. So basically, if you want a true 100% run, you'll likely need to hit up GameFAQs or another site that hosts guides.  -Namingway and his few sidequests are thankfully still in this version (although that doesn't save this version from being inferior to the DS and PSP versions). He mostly just has bits of dialogue when you talk to him, but there are a few sidequests involved in his later appearances. You also need to interact with him to get a few (useful) augments. So basically, if you see Namingway (or whatever name he happens to be going by at the time) in a new area, TALK TO HIM. His small interactions and sidequests are GREAT, unlike this version of FFIV. And now, I have one last gripe with this version...  SE's latest (and probably final) patch for this game, 1.0.4, was not even given a real changelog. Instead we get, 'Update contains just general bug fixes based on feedback received.' Seriously, Square? They didn't even fix the battle framerate with this patch. I'm pretty sure I bought this before this patch came out, because if I saw these patch notes in the latest patch, I would've avoided this like the plague, diehard FFIV fan or not.  *TL;DR* It's not that I don't recommend this game so much as I don't recommend this version. Get the DS version if you want the augment system, Whyt &amp; minigames, 3D visuals, or the PSP version if you're an old fan looking to get a faithful, updated version with the ability to switch between the arranged and original OSTs. Or be like me and get both! They're way better.",

It could have been a good experience but it's probably the worst port I've ever play. The game would be fun if it weren't for the extremely low battle frame-rate that's under the flicker-fusion threshold for the human eye. It would be even better if it didn't have any input lag.  Unfortunately it has both the horribly low frame-rate and the input lag so I can not recommend this game. In fact, I will do the opposite. Do not buy this game until the problem is patched. If it never gets patched then do not tell Square-Enix that this is acceptable by buying this game. 15 FPS in battles is just ridiculous on PC.",

            "review_text": "Final Fantasy IV is one of my favorite video games of all time, and easily in the top 3 of favorite Final Fantasy games. I came into this port after having completed (and enjoyed) repeated playthroughs of both the SNES incarnation (FF II) and the GBA port.  First Impression: I'll be honest, the first impression was quite bad. The art style can not be objectively judged, but the texture and model quality certainly can. It looks, purely from a technological point of view, inferior to even PSX titles (specifically FF7) and the camera during the travel segments is zoomed in so far, moving by minimap is basically essential. Dramatic frame drops during combat certainly did not help matters, resulting in the sluggish interface handling I've come to know with the GBA port. Not a killer, but I certainly would have appreciated a little more finesse.  In terms of audio, the game sounds convincingly like FF4. Nobuo Uematsu's masterful soundtrack has been slightly upgraded, but not completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ized (as has sadly been the case with FF8, another favorite of mine). Once again however, technologically, there is a bit of a letdown to be found. Rather than presenting us with proper volume adjustment, FF4 seems to think 4 levels of audio, for Music, SFX and Voices respectively, are plenty. This becomes especially grating when one considers that older FF titles implemented a substantial amount of grinding.  The gameplay itself is a slightly overhauled FF4 incarnation, with a lot of fresh air and solid functionality added to classic and beloved abilities. More than anything, the updates this version has made to Edward have elevated him from a distracting nuisance, to a legitimate party member, even if he is never along for extended periods of time. The maps have been revised to accomodate the minimap exploration and are thus much smaller, something I actually hate a lot less than I thought I would.  At last, the bosses have all learned new tricks and it is now possible to fail them. Initially a good thing, this unfortunately introduces the Shin Megami Tensei issue of having to play the bosses way far too often. The very first elemental fiend for example, is a serious problem when tackled conventionally, but an absolute pushover if spammed with healing magic. Clumsy. This sort of thing continues throughout larger parts of the game, but it never becomes offensive - it merely works its way up to annoying.  As far as the voice acting is concerned, I can once again not speak objectively on the choice of actors. In my head, over 20-ish years, the characters sounded quite differently. This is not a problem the game can be expected to tackle or even regard, so it would be unfair to fault it for not doing so. Technically, as in whether the actors were good or bad actors, I can not find much fault in FF4. Some lines sound a bit awkward, but it remains within the borders of realism. Some of us simply sound weird, after we've had a cry.  As a final point, people praise this port for having an increased difficulty. Speaking as someone who could not possibly care less for 'Hard Mode' bragging rights, I have played it on normal and it is indeed tricky at times. Like most poor quality difficulty mods for games however, the difficulty starts off rock hard and rapidly declines, as the characters build a cushion of Abilities to use in battle. If you are planning to buy this for the increased difficulty, you are essentially buying it for the first two hours plus the occassional 'Alright, what do you want me to do?' boss fight.  Final Fantasy IV (PC) is a solid game, all things considered. It is far from perfect. I sincerely recommend looking it up on YouTube before buying it, if you love the classic incarnations. Depending on your individual taste, the new features might make or break it for you.",

Overall, I was very happy that I played through this updated version of the game. I would say that if you're a fan of the SNES era of JRPGs, this game is well worth the 15 dollars I paid for it.",

            "review_text": "I REALLY WANT to like this. I REALLY do. Sadly i am only allowed to give it a yes or no recommendation. when really i want to give it a meh. Anyway i am going to be objective as possible. Personally for final fantasy 4 i will say the GBA version is the best. it wasnt 3d, there was no voice acting and everything that was supposed to be in the original was restored. The GBA version is the game at its most natural state. Then came the DS and PSP remake. When that came out i was very excited, and could get over the FF7 like graphics. the Cutscene opener looked great and then i played it. the story played out as it always had but the RNG was broken beyond playable. maybe it was my cart, but basically leveling up was meaningless and the characters typically didnt get any stronger for me. i never touched ff4 again until i heard they were porting it to ios and pc. I thought that was cute, but it turns out really it was just a port to ios. they removed a few ds specific features and slapped it together as quickly as possible. pc / steam version was even sloppier. now i am not a professional developer but i know porting things is not THAT complicated. 90 % of the work has been done aleady for you and sadly it shows here. The menu is identical to the IOS and android versions, and its slightly broken. If you pick up a peice of equipment that is usable in battle you must configure a command prior to the fight to even be able to use it. given that some characters come with a ton of commands it will be difficult to pick and choose if that oppurtunity comes up. The other thing they got rid of is the RNG development. this can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on who you ask. In the past the RNG hated me and broke my game and experience so in a way i was happy to see it go. But in its place is a VERY static character development. as far as i can tell it looks as if the character stats are meaningless. Combat formulas seem to rely solely on the level number the character is on. I know this because if you poke around the guides you will see one written by me detailing memory editing and plugging numbers in stats doesnt seem to affect anything, though editing the character level had a profound effect.  lastly is the 3d levels. for the most part the entire game has been remapped into 3d. but the lack of camera controls makes it somewhat difficult to navigate. the good news is the maps are pretty much identical to their 2d counterparts.  i feel weird for saying this but i think i liked the 2d sprites and graphics better, but thats just me. Here eveything has has been converted to 3d enemies bosses maps, the works. to their credits its the most effort square enix has put to porting a game ever, and the 3d conversion is a leap in a positive direction, but then you see the effort they put into releaseing ff13 to pc and you see corporate politics murder something great. its a shame really.   Anyway tl;dr: Its ff4 for the most part fully rendered in circa 1997 3d. cookie cutter character development is pretty much the only reasonable flaw i can find.",

            "review_text": "I loved this game when it was FFII on the SNES. I loved it more when I discovered the J2e translation of the 'real' game, not the 'Easytype' version that we got in NA. The PSX port was awful due to load times. This is basically the DS version ported to PC, and it more or less faithfully updates the game, but I do have a few issues with this version.  The Good + It's FFIV. + It's got improved graphics + It's got some quality of life improvements + Achievements + It's on Steam, and has cards  The stuff I didn't like - They altered the equippable items of some characters for no good reason. Why shouldn't the Paladin be able to use staves and bows (useful in lodestone cavern)? Why can't CId use bows (useful after the party has Kain, Cecil, and Yang all competing with him for one of the 3 front row slots)?  - They fixed three of my favourite exploits in the original game:   (1) Originally, when you got returning party members, they would come back at the average party level, now it seems like they come back at the level they were at before, or some arbitrary number.   (2) Related to the above, the original had a spot to the far north of Mysidia where you could go and grind much harder enemies (from the Troia encounter tables) for easy XP. Dark Knight in the back row, swing away, and your sword's instant kill ability would take care of the rest.   (3) The steal-equip trick no longer works. In the original, you could use this to equip any character (besides the one doing the stealing) with whatever you just stole. The most basic and obvious reason to do this is to give your magic users Mythril Shields, but it could also be used to give them weapons that will serve until near end-game; I used to give my summoner a Flame Spear, and my white mage a Gaia Hammer. You could also use this to give someone a charm harp, or other lesser weapons, just for giggles.  Those annoyances are not enough to make me not recommend the game, but it did significantly impact my enjoyment.",

Its max framerate is at 10/15 when on the map, while in battle its locked at 30. It makes the game super choppy. The one thing I do like is that they added a few new features. Plus the achievments. Gotta love achievments.   But overall review, buy a different version, or get the SNES version on emulator. This one isnt worth the money in my opinion.",

The game play isn't too bad, it may even be a little easier so far than the SNES version. I really have had to do any grinding yet and I remember so much grinding on the SNES. This is one of the few games where the updated graphics are a detriment to the game. I don't mean to knock the polygon graphics as much as the zoomed in camera. Navigating is such a hastle on this game. If you don't remember where things are, you can end up spening too much time looking at the maps. Personally I'd rather stumble around a maze because I didn't draw my own map, not than any dungeon level is that confusing, than have trouble because I can't see 5 feet in any direction from my character. Also, what's the deal with Yang's hair?? Why is he blonde??    Don't get me wrong Story A++++; CTB battles A++; Graphics C+(A+ if this were still 1998); Camera Angle F----. I just think it's a much better use of money to legally obtain a SNES and a copy of FFII at a local gameshop. Or get the emulator and rom. I just think it's sad that someone put all of the fine work into the opening sequence, which if you haven't played the game and don't know about it SKIP IT!! Huge spoilers in the opening movie.",

            "review_text": "NOTE: This review is based off of the original DS release, not the Steam port.  Being a fan of the original Final Fantasy IV, which was actually released in North America as Final Fantasy II way back when for the SNES, I decided that I would definitely be picking this beauty up.  When the game was in its development state, I despised the graphics they were using, as I'm sure were some of the older fans of the original game. And the majority of the time that I'm playing, certain aspects of the graphics still irk me to the core.  Anyways, on to the pros and cons!  Pros: Re-translated, way better this time. Voice actors did a wonderful job. Cinema scenes really draw out the emotion of the story better. (That Edge rage.) New unlockable equipment set; the Onion set. The removal of certain 'cheap tactics' from the SNES and GBA versions; IE casting Reflect on your party while fighting Bahamut so he Megaflares himself five times. Can't let you do that, Star Fox. Characters give out their abilities to the party when lost, and depending on if they have been given other augments, they give you more. Mini-games involving Rydia's personal Eidolon, Whyt, who can be renamed. Each of the five ending characters has their own game that increase his stats. They're fun, but difficult. You can customize Whyt with special outfits and draw him a new face. (I gave him the Awesome meme face.) Since you can't rename characters, there is a whole new side-quest involving Namingway that takes you everywhere. You get some pretty nifty augments from him too. Cecil is more badass than ever. It's still possible to power-level rather easily, which reduces -some- challenge, but it doesn't matter what your level is if you've still got a weakness to what the boss can do. There is a scene involving Edge that is so ♥♥♥♥win I had to rewatch it on YouTube. &gt;.&gt; Rubicante is still the most awesome villain ever. New Game+ can only be used twice. So, three playthroughs, then you can have to start new.  Cons: Rydia's hair pisses me off. Some bosses difficulties were -greatly- reduced. (I took down Leviathan rather easily, Odin too, which saddened me.) Rare items are rare. &gt;.&lt; (Though one of the rarer items I got way earlier than anyone else I know that has played this game.) Kain's voice actor sounds too gruff to me, too scratchy. Certain augments are completely useless. Gaining money early on is -very- difficult the first time through. You can only play a 'single' game three times through before you have to start over.  Square-Enix gets 4.5 Divine Shields out of 5 from me on this one. They did a really good job with this port. It's amazing. The graphics though, they still do it to me.  While I was waiting for this game to come out, I also discovered that when they wrote the initial story for Final Fantasy IV, the original SNES cart only held about 25% of the story on it. They didn't really add anymore to the story, but the voice acting and cinemas added a new element to the game that wasn't there before, not even the re-release on the PSX comes close to this.",

It's a smaller game from a smaller team very early in its debuted console's lifetime, and this fact is more than apparent. Plot points happen purely because they're plot points, and not because of anything actually compelling. Character design is there, and sometimes a bit of personality comes through, but it's largely flat and even absurd.  In the sprite-based versions of the game, I would even say that the gameplay is lacking, but the DS version that this (and Android and iOS) version is based off of improves it a bit. Bosses aren't quite as mindless a walk in the park anymore, which does wonders to keep things interesting. No more limited inventory space to curse at. Cutscenes with voice acting add a touch more personality, even if the in-game character models all look like they're dying of boredom. Okay, so it's still pretty corny, but it's at least less one-dimensional.  Final Fantasy IV will never truly win me over, and The After Years really did nothing to help this case, but this is definitely my preferred version to play, and gets my recommendation.",

Even including scenes that were completely missing or so poorly translated that they turned a monologue into a single sentence.  I really like all the extra features, some were cut from the original (summons) and some were additions from the DS version (augments). They make an old game that was at times a slog into a smooth experience. There are a lot of reviews bashing the graphics but of all Final Fantasy remakes I've played I think it was done best here. The characters are cuter but just as expressive and they never stray too far from the original design, the world design looks fantastic in my opinion. The menus are clearly designed for smart phone and took some time to get used to, that was my biggest issue.  So many people praise the PSP version but in my opinion it was the absolute worst, the translation of it is highly inaccurate and includes lots of modern references and cringe worthy memes. The extras there don't make up for how awful the rest is. This is the version to get.

There are a few problems in this release for veterans of the game.    The camera is EXTREMELY zoomed in with no way to zoom out. Maybe this was passable on mobile platforms with a limited size and resolution, but on PC's/laptops/HDTVs it makes things a bit frustrating and causes the player to rely on the mini-map.    The ability to use a weapon as an item natively has disappeared. If you want to do this, then you need to equip it to an augment slot. While the 'solution' is there, you lose versatility to choose which item effects you'd like to swap between.    The limit break augment is limited to only 1 period. This used to be 1 per playthrough and that was eliminated.   While these issues are not deal breaking, they are still present and frustrating for veterans. At the end of the day, it provides the classic Final Fantasy experience and those who already loved FFIV will enjoy some nostalgia with a few upgrades.

Even accounting for the restrictions of the DS release (low poly models, pixellated textures, 24fps cap during battles) it has a horrible UI taken from the iOS port (making this a port of a port of a rerelease :/) which means that it cannot display the whole battle menu without moving down (any reasonable PC display should be able to show the whole thing, hell, the console versions could) yet there is no mouse support which you'd think they could have done given the iOS port as a base. Also, gamepad support is fairly terrible, no Xinput or just DirectInput, though my 360 pad works it has deadzone problems (detects axis motion where there is none) which is a pain in the ♥♥♥♥.
