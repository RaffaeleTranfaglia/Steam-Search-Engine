            "review_text": "Quality over Quantity  To say that this game is short is an understatement.  This game occupies 3056 MB of space. Yeah, go figure. That's why they decided to not waste a DVD on it.  THE POSITIVES  1. This is a PC exclusive (a rare breed these days) with the fully optimized graphic options. The controls are smooth and responsive. I also found myself being swept over with feeling again and again that I was playing a PC exclusive. It is worth paying money to have that feeling - that's what the consoles are turning us into.  2. Your character is not a mute like in most shooters.  3. I will say that the new engine delivers. The distant vistas, the textures, the physics, the explosions, the graphics in general are great, DirectX 9.0c and all. The details are meticulous especially up close, you can see the tiniest scratches and dents on the objects.  4. True, there is no health regeneration.  5. The game runs smoothly, no FPS spikes, the dozen or so near-simultaneous explosions are an eye-candy.  6. Upgrades for the 10 weapons as well as the gear is always welcome. However, just like in Witcher 2, as soon as you finish upgrading one 'tech tree' or one upgradable branch the game ends.  7. Finally, this game has style. Even though the streets and the slums are empty except for the rampant robots, the peculiar sci-fi world where humanity has learned to download its consciousness into the computer is pretty cool to ponder about.   The minuses:  1. No crouching.  2. No melee (I doubt it's useful against the machines anyway but quite often they do get close enough to ram you)  3. You cannot see your legs and you do not cast a shadow.  4. BUT there is SHIELD regeneration - something the previewers failed to mention. So the concept of the old school no-health-regeneration kinda goes out the window.  5. No reloading.  6. The story is kinda blah.  7. The amount of enemy types is very limited.  8. The jump is realistic. And I by that I mean it is practically nonexistent. You cannot jump over the rails and some other objects even when it seems like you can to save time.  9. The game is extremely short. (4.5 hours)   The debatable table:  1. Initially, there is little to no tactics involved. Once you are met by a group of enemies you will tend to just retreat/move in circles and shoot them up. Since there is no reload option, there really is no incentive for you to stop shooting or taking time for aiming. You will also quickly utilize the environment for more efficient destruction. Tesla coils from the consoles, the explosions from the barrels, the gas balloons, etc., it's all there.  2. The gameplay is a cross of Doom 3, Serious Sam, Pain Killer and perhaps Unreal Tournament. Oh wait, all of those games have the same gameplay, that's right you move fast and you blow things away with the hundreds of rounds of ammo. So do not expect this game to make you ration your ammo or even health for that matter since your shield will regenerate.  3. The game is extremely linear [duh, it's a shooter) although there are plenty of secret areas that can be accessed if you blow up one of the adjacent oil barrels. Do not expect these secret areas to hold any secrets pertaining to the game, you will just find extra ammo most of the time. In the end, I found myself being sucked into this game nonetheless somehow. True, it is short, but on the other hand, you do not have to commit too much of your time into beating it.",

            "review_text": "Hard Reset is a game that very clearly sets out to evoke the more generic and traditional FPS style of yesteryear with the visuals aesthetic of a more modern game. It does that pretty well and it's a fun and enjoyable game, but it fails in a few areas that are somewhat glaring, and it does have it's problems. If you're about to stop reading this review because I'm not going to be 100% positive about this review, well, that's your perrogative, but I'm not saying it's by any means a bad game. It's a good game, bordering on great, but it has some foilbes that hold it back from true excellence.  The aesthetic of the game is probably one of the parts it really does very well, and it extends entirely through the game. It has a very heavy cyberpunk aesthetic, loading screens are hidden behind very artfully done comic book intermissions, and the visuals of the game are absolutely gorgeous. It has an actually fairly strong story for a FPS (which .. admittedly isn't saying much), and things thematically are pretty strong and engaging. However, there's two fairly large problems with this aesthetic and both of them essentially boil down to making things hard to distinguish. First of all, having robotic enemies in a game level that largely involves a lot of technological set pieces makes it very difficult to distinguish enemies at a glance. Compare this to something like Painkiller or Serious Sam where the enemies are relatively speaking very easy to distinguish from the scenery. Also, having electrical particle effects for hit confirmations on enemies when the destructible environment pieces also give off the same or similar particle effects make it difficult to say whether you are hitting an enemy with your shots, or the environment. The two guns in their different modes also are difficult to distinguish what mode they are in just by looking at them. They do have differences in the modes, but they are subtle and hard to tell at a quick glance.  The gunplay is simultaneously a very strong element of the game but also very disappointing. The fact that the two weapons in their different modes handle so well, with a tangiable feel of weight, satisfying visuals, and good sound assets, only serves to accentuate my disappointment and frustration with them having the two weapon mode system. I don't feel the system adds anything to the game of value in this case. In some games with a two weapon system what you have is a large weapon selection and you have to choose the two of them that you feel best work for the tactical situations and enemies that you will be facing. However, with all the different modes available at all times, I kind of am left in agreement with TotalBiscuit's comment in his first impressions that it seems like they used the two weapon mode so that they didn't have to create a series of different weapon models. It's unfortunate. These weapons would have been easier - and truer to the 'old school' FPS, if they were simply seperate weapons.  The level design is a fairly strong aspect of the game, with lots of areas to explore and a large amount of secrets to find in each. I like the feeling in several of the levels that you are actually in coherent areas which actually make sense in canon as well; for example one section being a little shanty-town of trailers where people live. It evokes memories of the level design of Duke Nukem 3D, which is a comparison I make as highest praise, as that was a high point in FPS level design. The Levellord was a master of the craft.  One thing that bears touching on to is that the overall pacing of the levels and the game in general is executed tremendously well. There's a feeling of momenteum to the game that keeps things going at a decent clip unless you pause to go rummaging and every time I would think to myself that the enemy variety is thinning out there'd be a new enemy, and every time I started feeling comfortable with the level of difficulty the game would ramp it up again.  All in all a very well-crafted game with a good theme let down by a couple of fairly large issues that don't stop it from being a very good game and well worth your time and money.",

            "review_text": "Hard Reset is an old-school FPS shooter with a heavy dose of cyberpunk. As Major Fletcher in the year 2436, you have to defend Bezoar city - humanity’s last sanctuary from an unrelenting hoard of machines, while uncovering a more sinister plot unrevealing in the background. To do so you have two state of the art rifles at your disposal, one based upon kinetic projectiles and the other based upon futuristic energy tech.  There is no cover system and no crouching, this means quick decisive action is the main style of play. By upgrading your weapons with various modules, you can unlock different firing modes; such as shotgun and rockets for the kinetic rifle, or lightning and homing plasma for the energy rifle. There are no handholding tutorials either, so you have to figure out how best to utilise each module against your enemies. Learning to think on your feet is essential.  You can draw good comparisons between this and the Painkiller series, with each stage divided in multiple sections, defended by waves of robots; progress is inhibited until every last bit of those cursed bots are put down for good. So if you never liked playing Painkiller, this probably won’t fare much better with you.  Bezoar is a vibrant city with many dangers lurking every corner, hovercrafts blanketed the skies as neon billiards flickered under the heavy rain. Every stage is unique and distinct from one another, you can tell a lot of attention was placed in level designs. Which is a shame since the cityscape is mostly devoid of life and you will never see many people during game play, the robot menace are fairly uncreative too and they tend to become bullet sponges later on.  The main game consists of 7 levels while the free Exile DLC bought that up to 12. An initial play through lasts around 7-12 hours to complete, while it will take at least 40 hours or more if you aim to complete every achievement. An arena mode exists but it isn’t fully integrated with the Steam leader boards, so I didn’t bother much with it.  Lastly, a “re-mastered” version was released called “Redux”. Logic would assume that Redux will be superior, but with arguable improvements on graphics, a gimmicky “cyber katana” that added no value to actual game play, a seriously dumb down level of difficulty for console babies and no additional modes or levels, you are probably better off buying this cheaper version for now.  In conclusion Hard Reset is an underappreciated gem that can be a bit rough on the edges, but it is ultimately an enjoyable experience to play and a refreshing take on the old school formula. All FPS enthusiasts should look out for it during sales.",

There were a lot of complaints about its length, but if you play through the base game and the DLC, you're in for probably 10 or more hours of shooting good times.  The weapons are interesting and the difficulty is high enough that I found I needed to use the crowd control mechanics extensively in order to get by.  I played the game on Hard, which is the default setting I use when playing shooters, and this one was by far the hardest one I've played in recent memory. There was one boss fight in the original chapters I died 49 times on!  One cool thing about the level design is that there are a lot of secrets tucked away in the levels which is something a lot of corridor shooters have lost over the years since the Doom II days. Some of the secrets are pretty easy to find, but some required really studying the options available in the room to figure out how to get to them.   I highly recommend advancing to the Rail Gun or the RPG as fast as possible (accomplish this by checking the pre-reqs on it and focusing on them as high priority upgrades). The rest of the weapons do not do enough damage to really chip through the harder enemies fast enough. Again, this was on Hard. Maybe Normal is a cakewalk, I dunno.  Overall, good game, probably didn't get the acknowledgement it deserved.  One final note - the story is nigh incomprehensible, the VO often cringeworthy, the cutscenes okay, but the Cyberpunk setting is cool and you don't need to understand the story to enjoy blowing up endless waves of robots with a creatively versatile arsenal.",

The game throws robots at you, and you keep shooting them. The robots are very good at killing you. What changes through the levels is that you upgrade your weapon systems, getting better and better ways to shoot them, and to protect you. There are secrets scattered all over, if you explore you find them. Most of the secrets somehow evade me.  So that's it, you keep shooting the robots. It doesn't have any issues on playability though, the engine is smooth and solid, no irks.  I'll give it a 60%.  Addendum ---------------  Well I didn't realize while writing the last review, I actually completed the non-DLC game by then, and just entered the DLC Exile. Completed exile now, more of same thing. Also adding some more words to the the vocabulary of the main protagonist, major Fletcher, other than 'Fuuuuck!' would have been nice...",

There will eventually be 10 weapons to choose from, but most likely you would focus on 3 or 4. I went mortar/shotgun at the start then switched to smartgun/mortar/rpg at the end. Not any really jumping puzzles, but I did kill myself from falling or jumping somewhere I shouldn't have a few times. The game uses a checkpoint save system. At worse, i think you would have to repeat 5 to 10 minutes of content if you died. I think there was a boss battle at the end of each mission and I think there was at least 3 big boss battles. My old 2008 XP computer did freeze and crash several times during gameplay, usually when there were a lot of enemies on my screen. It is unlikely I will play this game on harder difficulty levels or probably play the game ever again, but for $1.49, I definately think it was worth the money.",

There's no cover system or regenerative health, no pressing E/F to pick up items (walking over them simply grabs them.) A no nonsense, no fuss game, yet it still offers a nice array of interesting weaponary to play with &amp; upgrade using 'NANO Currency' you collect.    The game is pretty full on in the way of lots of things that can be destroyed, but mostly the fact that it can get extremely chaotic very quickly. Making sure you move around while shooting is essential. Worth noting is there isn't any quick save option, instead you get spawned back to the last checkpoint. I found this a little frustrating, but in fairness checkpoints aren't too far apart.    Campaign mode takes more or less around 8 hours to finish, but it does offer achievements and a survival mode to add further hours of gameplay.    I enjoyed the game, but unlike some other games I think Hard might be too challenging for my taste.",

You must now fight your way through different levels in the game to complete your missions.

There are machines in the game(Robots) who can and do charge at you, Little flying Robots with sawblades who come at you, among a few, and as the game progresses, it gets progressively harder, even starting on the easy levels. overall, this game is fun, but as the title of my review states, it can be frustrating at times.

The level design isn't as interesting as the latter, but the game still has room for a few secrets for you to uncover. Each weapon is unique, with various uses, although the slow upgrade system doesn't encourage experimentation with the weapons (it's balanced for you to have 80-85% of the upgrades by the end of the game). Still, even though it may take a while, each weapon is pretty satisfying.   Wave uponh wave of enemies. The big problem is how resilient they are to damage. Even a rocket launcher is rather inneffective... Then again, I played on Hard mode. It's... really hard. Sometimes frustrating, putting high damage enemies with you into very small spaces.   But, despite that big flaw, the game is still a hell of a lot of fun!  Visually, it's nothing short of impressive, with a huge, cyberpunk city. The lighting system is pretty good as well.  Then, there's the physic's system. It's a big part of what makes this game awesome to play! Everything explodes and breaks apart, and you can basically shoot everything long after they're dead. It gets a bit too resource intensive, but it's worth it.  The levels are a bit too long to my taste (usually 40minutes +), seeing how much you die. Checkpoints are really unforgiving as well, with the game lacking a 'quicksave' feature.  But hey, if you're looking for a game that is purely about the shooting, with little other distractions, definitely check this out!",

At first glance, this seems like a classic-style twitch shooter, but it's actually more about cycling through the cooldowns on your weapons efficiently and keeping dangerous enemies stun-locked while you whittle down their huge health pools. Your character doesn't dodge very quickly, and the environments have a ton of junk to get caught up on, which is frustrating.

The whole ordeal was a slog through slow paced shooting sections. There is obviously an attention to to detail here, but the core elements of the game are just fundamentally broken. The story is delivered through minimal character voice overs during gameplay and short comic strip-like segments between loading screens. The voice is acting is...decent, and the comic style of the cutscenes is interesting. But beyond an interesting comic style and a neo-future cyberpunk setting, this game falls flat.  There is an attempt at interest, but the cyberpunk setting is washed out by a spew of browns and grays in a variety of dark and blue-tinted areas. The setting never really feels different between two locations: street level and underground. The enemies are all bulletsponges and their design are both from an aesthetic standpoint, and a gameplay standpoint, uninspired. Every enemy is a one trick pony, repeatedly attempting to kill with it's one attack mechanism. For most enemies, you simply dodge while holding down the trigger until either they blow up, or you run out of ammo. The topic of dodging leads me to my next point that the level design is awful. I would expect this kind of design from a student project, not a full release game. The areas are excessively linear with obvious tells for every single ambush of enemy robots. Environmental hazards play a large role in the combat, but everything is incredibly played out. If there is going to be a wave of enemies to ambush you, there will also be a series of explosive barrels or electrical spouting conduits to fry them up. Most enemy encounters are simply there to pad the experience. Many times enemies seemed to just appear in an area because the game said so. Most combat was either myself against a large charging enemy in an open area, or myself against many small enemies in a closed area. When you are required to dodge many small enemies in a closed off corridor like area with minimal movement, it's not fun, it's not a challenge, it's frustrating. In one instance, an ambush blew through a wall, but upon inspection of their entrance point, it was a closed concrete block in a hole.  You only get two weapons in the game. Each one has it's own twist, and the weapon variety is accomplished through allowing upgrades for each of these two weapons. Through the usage of upgrades, your bullet based weapon and your plasma based weapon can each turn into 4 other weapons, totalling 10 different guns. However, these guns feels the same. None of your attacks seem to have presence. Accuracy is abyssmal, and when combined with the fact that all enemies have massive amounts of health (or you simply don't deal any damage) any combat interacting is simply tedious.  The movement is a joke too. For a game that so heavily relies on dodging telegraphed enemy attacks, movement is stagnant and stale feeling. Your characters jaunts around at a slightly sluggish speed. You have the ability to sprint - if I could even call it that - but it really just makes your character move slightly faster for only a few seconds and makes your screen and HUD shake a lot. The jump is floaty, as if your character lacks weight, and you also can't jump while sprinting. There was a speed puzzle where a lift needed to be activated by a button across the room. You then had to run down a staircase and across the room before it went back up. With the sluggish controls, it was tedious and took multiple attempts before realizing that to get there faster, I should not sprint, so that I could jump into the lift as it was going up.  There are definitely some cool concepts here. Floating UIs for upgrade panels and actual interaction screens for devices in the game are interesting and function very well. The visuals themselves are very good. Everything is for the most part impressively rendered and the visual effects are nice to look at. But the art style, the sluggish controls, unvaried weapons, and completely uninteresting and uninspired combat really sink this game. I tried to like it, but I can't and shouldn't have to force myself to clear a game out of my backlog.",

            "review_text": "SHORT REVIEW: The developers have no idea how to make a videogame.   LONG REVIEW: I have no idea where to begin on how bad this game is. As a fan of mindless shooter, I can't fathom how flawed the game is in its core.  The character's movement does not feel the player is in control entirely to compensate the chaotic situations that the game constantly puts the player in, as sprinting and jumping are not very fluid. You cannot jump freely while sprinting, you lose a bit of handling while at it, and sprinting lasts for a very short period of time. All of the enemies (and I mean all of them), have faster movement speed, usually 2 to 3 times faster than the character so the player is forced to be constantly moving with the game's awful controls.  The game seriously lacks variety of enemy types, but it also suffers from their flawed designs. Enemies should be very exciting to fight, but they are incredibly annoying to deal with.  There are self-destructive bots that move in an incredible speed whose explosion radius is massive, shockwave emitting crawlers which lock on you (for the most of the time you cannot avoid them easily) when charging at an accelerated speed, ranged gunners whose projectiles travel as fast as bullets, fast-moving rollers who charge at you to saw your limbs off, and other varieties of the said enemy types.  What's worse is that the game tends to put all of these annoying enemies in a single wave at once in which the player has to rely on variety of lucks or stupid AIs doing funky things to beat. The game features about 3 different enemy types with different armor levels and different weapons on them. Some of these types have no weaknesses on how to kill them without almost dying. The game still gives you enough regen after a wave to restore back to perfect health, but it is no excuse to design a game where the player is meant to be hurt to almost death situations after every wave. This is the most frustrating part of the game. I died the average of 3 times per chapter, and after those deaths I didn’t bother changing a strategy and was still able to beat the level I had trouble with, because the enemy AIs were so unpredictable and had no counter-strategy to work with. It was all just luck for the most part. Explosion radius is bigger than the usual player’s predictions in the game’s FOV (and the game basically feeds on explosions), most of projectiles are semi-homing and they also explode dealing damage to the player around even though it misses, small enemies charge at you while you are dealing with bigger enemies and vice versa, and most of them don’t have any counter-strategies to work with. One of my favorite mindless shooter is the Serious Sam series, and the game had enemies that were simply very fun to play against, so I can tell you that mindless shooter does not mean mindless design.  The level design is nothing of stellar, and sometimes makes no sense at all. The game has a hint system telling the player what to do, only when they reach a point. Here's why the hint system is completely useless:  There are points that emit green lights where the player has to go and interact with to advance in the level and it's ALWAYS just as simple as clicking on the button when they reach the point. However, the developers think the players lack brain so it tells them to “click on the button to ... (insert any unnecessary information)”. The problem is that the levels aren’t designed well enough to sometimes let player know where to go in the dark environment, and the game does nothing to assist the player with. It tells the player to click on the button once they reach the only green-lit interactive interfaces which is completely useless. Later in the game, the levels have so many map decorations that are lit green with interfaces that cannot be interacted with. The players are accustomed to click on whatever that has an interface screen and green-lit, and the final levels of the game break this one rule that they’ve been training their players with. Often there will be times where it damages the player for absolutely no reason with some pre-scripted moving objects. There is no way to avoid them, and the game gives you a regen shortly after. Why were these put in the sequence in the first place?  The game looks pretty nice, but it is nothing of amazing. If the game was released on the consoles I doubt it would look as decent as any other average titles. I was playing this on my 780 Ti and I still experienced frame drops on chaotic situations, which the most of the game is in except when the player is walking to point A from point B. I can only assume the game is terribly optimized at best.  The game is the definition of frustration. There were so many flawed designs with no sense of innovation being found from the game, so I had to look up who in the world developed this terrible game. Flying Wild hog, as stupid as their name sounds, had no experience as it was their first game in the market. I will make sure to avoid any games from them in the future and so should anyone who wants to have fun with videogames.",

This is an extremely generic first person shooter that lacks many expected features of the genre. You can’t even duck, which should tell you something about how the game is meant to be played. It’s all mindless run and gun action. I wouldn’t mind so much if the game wasn’t so uninteresting. Blowing up wave after wave of the same robots is, simply put, boring. The cyberpunk environments are dull and repetitive, and the weapon loadout is quite limited. There is an upgrade system for the weapons and armor, but it’s a pain to navigate. Some of the upgrades are fun for a while, but they still don’t provide enough variety to hold my interest. The story is expectedly poor and primarily told through comic book style cutscenes. These cutscenes help hide the otherwise lengthy load times, but that means you can’t skip them. With a multitude of quality first person shooters to choose from, there’s no reason to waste any time with a game as simple and predictable as Hard Reset.",

The story isn't amazing but the cutscenes are done in animated comic book style which is pretty cool. The original campaign isn't too long, but combined with the Exile DLC, this game becomes a bit lengthier. Because the DLC adds on more levels without including more weapons/upgrades, the game becomes harder, especially if the upgrades chosen before entering the DLC levels were purely offensive like I did. The enemies become much tankier so getting upgrades on health, defense, and ammo are definitely needed. On the other hand, the level design were more varied, which is a plus, and felt better overall.  Technically, there are only two weapons, but each gun has multiple modes. For example, one gun can transform from an assault rifle to a grenade launcher while the other can morph from traps to a rail gun. Choosing the proper weapon and mode on the fly takes a while to get used to, but becomes fairly satisfying once you get the hang of it. If your mouse has extra buttons, it's probably a good idea to hotkey the weapon swap to one of them as pressing the keys for it always felt a bit awkward for me.  It's got a decent length campaign mode as well as other replayable modes, which I haven't tried. While the story isn't quite there, I would recommend this if you want to play an old school shooter game.",

Cool noir-ish style in its story, some very intriguing sci-fi concepts, fantastic gunplay and a gun-focused progression system, this game doesn't really lack anything. The gun system is interesting, you have two guns which have multiple modes of firing and you upgrade them as you go, also unlocking more fire modes, I think this system works very well combined with all the different enemies you'll face. I especially liked shooting the bigger enemies with a shotgun or a railgun, and seeing all the armor plating fly away, yet the buggers kept coming - so many thrilling fights! The boss fights are very enjoyable, the levels have lots of destructible environment and last but not least; this game has a lot of secret places - just like good old FPS games used to have.

The cyberpunk atmoshpere is pretty nice too, kinda made me wish there was a some sort of RPG-game based in this universe. The action/shooty part is excellent, you have two main weapons: projectile and energetic; and as you collect more upgrades for both, you can turn them into shotgun, rocket launcher, shock gun, rail gun, etc. There are many variations of robotic enemies, and there are interesting boss-fights. Those will keep you occupied. I like the fact that game isn't particularly hard to beat, but it's quite challenging. I died many times.

Liked the new challenge until 4/5th of the way through and a certain level became impossible. Too many hard hitters at once that can kill yea in a couple hits. Quit and went back to easy being I already died on on that certain spot for hours. Everything in this game screams at you from the developers that we are going over the top for you. Somehow, still this game feels average to me, even wih all the eye candy in here. Some parts shine and others look like a beautiful mish mash. This game gets an A for effort but still falls to average to me. There isn't much wrong here that will disapoint most in buying this game. The developers tried extremely hard but instead of that gold ring, they got brass. The game is fun to play, it just wont blow your socks off.

The game is set in a stunningly designed cyberpunk future, that will have you staring at all the intricate details in the buildings... right until the waves of cyborg enemies start. Great weapon design, especially the subtle animations as you upgrade your firepower with new modules and switch between them, and all have a great kick to them.  Particle effects, explosions, fire - every firefight is a visual delight, especially with elements of the environment aiding in the destruction.  If you are a fan of classic old school FPS, do not ignore this game. It's certainly worth its full asking price.",

But I went back to it and I must say it is a very enjoyable old-school shooter with some new Ideas that may not be revolutionary but keep the game from getting boring.  The Weapons are fun and the upgrade system is rewarding since you get a new 'function' for your multipurpose weapons almost every few minutes throughout the entire game. There are many weapons to choose from so everyone should find something to their liking.   You bascially have two wepons, a standard rifle/shotgun/missile launcher etc. and an energy weapon with a bunch of different modes ranging from plasma blaster to railgun. You can switch between these two wepons at anytime by pressing Q/E and switch between the modes using the mouswheel. It can however be a little bit difficult to switch between all these different weapons on the fly, and modes on the same weapon don't differentiate themselves from eachother much. This can lead to frustration sometimes.   I really have to give the game credit for it's  level design  though. Every new environment looks different from the last and the levels are constructed in a way that's challenging, but you never really get lost. The levels are also  stuffed  with details, most of which are also destructible. The vistas in this game are stunning and even the skyboxes are a filled with details. It's also got some nice lighting effects going on.   I played it with the DLC and must say the game probably would have been a bit short without it, and sadly even with the DLC the story feels very lackluster and doesn't really come to any sort of conclusion, so don't expect a great story. Other than that though I feel Hard Reset is well worth it's money if you're looking for a straight up shooter with a nice cyber-punk esthetic.",

With a checkpoint system that opens the new area while sealing the last the levels feel more like a series of confined arena's packed with a mixture of heavily scripted spawns making for a very hectic style of arcade gameplay.  With old school secret areas dotted around containing power ups, and intermittent upgrade points players can spend any nanites (experience) they're collected to upgrade different aspects of defense or offense. Such customisation will alter difficulty and play style allowing some longevity for re-runs.  The graphics are nice and with an environment full of destructibles the game encourages the use of stategic misses to take out the enemy hordes in a more imaginative manner then simply clicking on them repeatedly. Another nice touch is the hit zone allocation to enemy allowing the player to strategically cripple or desperately reduce enemy constructs 1 part at a time, resulting in different animations and behaviour.  The comic book style interludes add atmosphere and story to an otherwise shallow in-game experience.  Summary: Good looking frantic fun with short bursts of fast and reflexive gameplay between bouts of leasurely safety.",

I've only played about 6 hours of the game at the time of typing but it would be fair to say that the graphics are very good. I love the fact that a lot of the environment is desctructible and causes a lot of explosions. Hell, I can simply spen 5 minutes shooting explodable barrels and gas cannisters just to watch the explosion causing barrels to shoot into the air. It would be fair to say therefore that the physics are top.  The storyline is okay. And that's coming from me who has the attention span of a 5 year old and struggles to follow any story line. The game is linear but not too restricting. There are secret areas to find points that allow you to level up your kit. I'm mainly using the gatling gun type thing. Add a grenade launcher and mine placer/firer thing and it's a decent weapon.  It's quite difficult on normal difficulty and some of the end level bosses are difficult.   Overall, it's a fun game, with good graphics and music score (forgot to mention that).",

I liked the look and feel of the weapons as well. Not over complicated with plenty of clues to progress through the game. Cutscene videos feel right too. Very enjoyable!!",
