After few hours in the game, i like the visuals, even though they are not like on AAA titles. But they are well looking and fit well into the game world. I experienced some minor flaws but the game ran well and did not crash or showed bad fps until now.  I think the game is fun and i would rebuy it after my current progress. If this opinion changes in later parts of the game I will update this review.",

After awhile dispatch will stop notifying me of crimes and then if I reload the my game, I am blasted with fifty crimes all at once. This is all happening on the first level. If the bugs get fixed, then I would definitely recommend the game but as of now, it is unplayable.  Edit: I am now changing my review to a positive one. The above issues have been fixed and the developers are working on all other MAC issues. The game is very fun and a lot of time can be sunk into playing the game. It can at times get a little overwhelming but if you like a challenege, then that definitely gives it realism. I do suggest to take a moment every few hours, at least, for a moment to catch your breath. Overall, great game!",

If I save the game then load it up my city is hit with a huge amount of crime all at once and the most of my officers are out of action for the next 10 mins and thats just the start of the bugs. It feels like an alpha... not even a beta.  Maybe sort the bugs out and I will recommend it, but not until.  (UPDATED) 14th September - BUGS FIXED!",

This game is amazing! I did note that the game does have a couple bugs, like occasionally my units would path out to a district I hadn't unlocked. Overall a good game. For the $20 CAD it's almost worth it, and if you're like me you'll impulse buy it anywyas. If you can get this game while it's on sale... DO IT! You wont be dissapointed.

When playing the game for 55 minutes, and already seeing theese bugs and more, I decided to ask for a refund.",
