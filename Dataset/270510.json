            "review_text": "Well, I've read the comments that were made about this game. The most was positive and there was a negative comment made. So this made me reluctant to purchase this game at first. But then I looked through the comments again and the description the developers wrote. I've bought a lot of, in my opinion, bad games that I've either finished and will not play again or that I've not finished and did not have the desire to do so - hence my reluctance to purchase this game. Was this going to be one of those that I own which I wish I didnâ€™t? Then I though what the heck ... the game is on special, what can I lose. To my surprise the size was very small and I thought 'o yea, it's one of those'. But after I have played for a bit I decided I liked this game. It may be arcade style, but nevertheless the gameplay caught on and I really enjoyed it. It's a game that I can play after a day of hard study when my mind is burned out and I just don't want to think anymore (I mean that in a good way) ... I just want to relax and blow up stuff to get rid of all my tension. So my final verdict ... I think for a good price this game is really not bad. Its fun, sometimes challenging. So for this 'trash' (to use a quote) I'll give it thumbs up. Thanks guys.",

            "review_text": "Nice graphics, nice story and fun on rails gameplay. You are Epoch a robot who awakes in a post apocalyptic world with only one directive in its system: Protect the princess. So you start your way towards the last known ubication of the princess while you fight other hostile robots. The game is short, 2 hours to complete. I would wish to see Epoch 2 in Steam too.  My only complain is that it takes too much time to unlock logs, the logs are the main source about the story.",
