    "description": "The aim of this game is to maneuver Taro Heibon and get close to the cos-play girls without being noticed. It's the right time to get close to them when they are facing away, so try to move closer before they face round. After passing all the stages, you can register the girls in your Gallery. Find the girls you like and make a move.",
