The game is a puzzle adventure and Lucas has the ability to switch between human and wolf forms which becomes necessary for solving puzzles since each form has abilities that the other lacks. The game is fun, the puzzles are challenging and the game is quite humorous. Plus you're a werewolf who solves puzzles! How cool is that?!",
