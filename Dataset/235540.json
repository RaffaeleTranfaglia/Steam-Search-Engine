No, not the SPESS MEHREEN universe, this is 40K years before, so you will be fighting in swords and flintlocks instead of powerswords and powerflintlocks.  Like Left4Dead,  - You get to kill a lot of targets that scramble to claw your face off. - You will play with a multicultural cast of characters. - You can get strangled to death - You will often be covered in green, disgusting ooze - You will be pounced at and pinned to the ground - You will be whooped, walloped and flung around like a ragdoll when a giant monster with anger issues shows up - You can administer first aid to yourself or your allies which takes a while to channel - You can be revived for a few times until you're taken down for good  However, unlike Left4Dead - You get to use 5 distinctly different characters, almost like a class based shooter. - You receive loot at every end of the mission, which can be scrapped and rerolled into possibly better loot. - You don't need to pick up weapons. - Running out of ammo isn't too troubling, but ammunition boxes are sight for sore eyes. Especially if you're a witch hunter. - You aren't playing as survivors. More like pest control. - You will actually get shot at. By a rodent. With a gatling gun. Firing magical bullets. - Your team will get wiped quite often against a marching band of rats with metal armours. - You get to learn how to speak Dwarvish. - You also get to learn A LOT about Cousin Okri. - You get to BLESS THIS RAVAGED BODY.  Would highly recommend this game for: - A band of friends trying to find a game to play - People enjoying a rich co-op experience with high replayability - Fans of the Warhammer universe - Fans of L4D",

            "review_text": "I don't mind this game and I love Warhammer, but it falls short in it's core gameplay mechanics and setting.  People and review websites are giving this game way too much credit and praising the things that it actually get's wrong. I have seen many people praise it for it's good RPG elements, fun and exciting loot, as well as saying there is good class design, saying that they each have their own unique playstyle. No, it BARELY scrapes the surface of being an RPG and each class does not have their own unique playstyle, that is an absolute joke.    1. It's a Warhammer game, but it doesn't matter. Warhammer is a deep universe, I expect to be immersed in the world, I expect depth. There's no reason this should be a Warhammer game. It's got no story, no narrative, no lore, no interesting characters. It's got no skills, it's got no classes and the different races of the 'classes' are completely meaningless, and on top of that there is no atmosphere, nothing close to a Warhammer feeling. They copied Left4Dead (to it's detriment) a bit too much, they made all the five playable characters practically identical. The only thing that separates them, is what weapons they use, and many of the classes have very similar weapons. Every playable character has the same HP, same defense, same movement, same dodge, same bashes, etc, the only thing different is what weapon they use. Their race means nothing, their profession means nothing. I expect the Witch Hunter to be unique, I expect the Waywatcher to be unique, because she is an elf and an archer AND this is Warhammer.  People say that this game feels like a Warhammer game and captures it's essence in spades. If this blows you away like that, then when Total War Warhammer is released you will have a heart attack.   2. The combat is simple but has a bit of depth. The use of bashing to knock down enemies and dodging backwards and to the sides helps the combat feel more involved, but for the most part you are spamming left click with the occasional right click and dodging/bashes. You repeat the same maps over and over. This is to be expected, but it would help if the combat was more interesting. All the good loot based games have skills. Diablo, Torchlight, Path of Exile, Grim Dawn, Borderlands, etc. On top of the skills in these games, they have equips with abilities that have skill changing effects. In Diablo, there are legendaries that extend the use of skills by providing a certain buff to them as well as possibly adding an extra mechanic(s) to that skill, while sets change skills drastically by adding extra mechanics and buffs to even multiple skills. Sets in conjunction with certain legendaries as well as certain skills make for many unique playstyles with many mechanics. All of these games have skills, all of them have unique weapons and armor. Warhammer Vermintide ONLY has weapons and they are boring. Nothing unique about them. There is a bow called a true flight bow. It aimbots the enemies head for you. That's as far as it goes.   Traits are pretty much the closest thing that can make your weapons unique. They are abilities on your weapon, but they don't change much, they are boring. 'Heal some hp on hit, 3%-10% chance.', '3% chance to instantly slay any sized enemy on charged attack hit.', '% chance on kill to recover 20% ammunition for your ranged weapon.'  Pyromancer is the only 'class' with anything unique about them. They have a heat meter, and you use your staff to do devastating AOE fire blasts. The more you do and the longer your charge these attacks, the quicker you charge up your heat meter, and when it's full you gotta cooldown. This is better than nothing. It just sucks because it is pretty much a disadvantage to have.   You don't want to add skills? That is fine, but add something. Make weapons have abilities, make races have special traits, release some passives into the game so there is SOME diversity. COME ON, anything. Passives would be fine, along with weapon abilities. When I get an orange item, I want it to be epic. All it is, is a slightly better blue, but much harder to get. I want it to be special.   Some of the trinkets have decent effects. '60% less damage taken from gas clouds', '15% chance to not use a consumable on use', 'When reviving, you cannot be interrupted'. These are the most radical effects in the game. This is Warhammer, the universe where moons are brought down from orbit with magic, but this is the best they can do. Weapons with effects like an AOE blast after you have done enough damage with the weapon or something is lore fitting and completely balanced.   3. Progression. There is like none. The only thing to do in the game is to get loot, very lackluster loot. There are three equipment slots, technically. Melee weapon, ranged weapon and three trinket slots. WHY NO ARMOUR? Because they want every character to have the exact same HP and defense. There are cosmetic helmets. Regardless, you will spend a ton of time trying to get the perfect loot for one 'class', let alone all five, but that's not the point. It's a lot of effort to get the good loot from missions. Doing long missions on hard-nightmare with two grimoires and three tomes is no joke, it is hard, especially in public games. It's a big commitment and failing it, which will happen, is very demoralizing and time consuming, and you get nothing for your time spent if you do fail, even at the end. When you do succeed, you will most likely get a blue. If you do get an orange, most likely it's not for a 'class' you play, or you already have it. If you do get the one you want, it doesn't really mean much, and actually, if you do get the one you want, great, that's all the content for you, end game has been reached. What now? No skills, no cool effects, very lackluster and boring stats in game being extremely black and white with absolutely no diversity or depth. I have 6 oranges, so that's three of my classes geared to the teeth. I have no reason to play the game now really. I have nice weapons and getting an upgrade would require a massive amount of luck and time spent, time which I have absolutely no desire in committing in the hopes of getting a very minimal upgrade, while I actually just end up getting all blue items and a few orange items which are completely useless because I've already reached the dam end game. What's the point? There is no progression.  I guarantee you, that this game is in it's honeymoon phase. I doubt many people will get over 100 hours of this game before they quit. Unless the devs drastically add end game content and more progression systems and maybe enhance the combat, I do not see this game having a significant player base in the near future. I thought I was going to play this game for a while, all of my friends thought so too, but that is not the case. DLC's with extra maps and more weapons won't cut it, not unless they are unique and different.   4. Buggy as hell. From the Devs who brought you War of the Roses and War of the Vikings. It seems they are taking this seriously. They did however abandon War of the Vikings.   Conclusion  I don't think this genre, first person survival where every character is forced to be equal is good for a loot based game because since every character is completely equal, the combat has to be simple and the same for every 'class', making grinding very repetitive and boring. This game also does not feel like a Warhammer game. If they add some way to diversify yourself more in the game, be it skills, passives or weapon effects, it would help greatly. I think all of the five 'classes' should have something unique about them other than the weapons they can equip.",

            "review_text": "TL;DR. One of the best games i've ever played, until recently suffering updates that focused massively on removing mechanics that helped the players instead of also focusing in fixing the glitches that ruin the game. This company has also failed to meet it's deadlines, it seems like that they spent too much time something that was broken, but fun in it's own unique way, instead of actually adding promissed content.  Please be aware that this is a review from somebody who solely plays on cataclysm, if you play on another difficulty please don't bother. Now let's talk about the balancing and debugging.  -They have now removed block revive, which was a strong and vital part of the game, if you go down on cataclysm during a horde, you are bound to die, unless all of your teammates have distraction on their weapons, this did not use to be the case, the block revive used to be a counter part glitch that helped the players to the overwhelming ammount of glitches that sought out to punish the players (i.e. rats hitting through walls, under the floor, or through the ceiling).  So if you decide to remove a glitch that actually was a good mechanic in the game, why not also remove one of the most hated and frustrating bugs in your game? It does not add up.  Weapon variety is a joke, specially on the wizard, who only used the beam staff which now got ridiculously nerfed, making her virtually useless, i won't even mention the other staffs, even after the buffs, they are still a punch in the gut to the players. Did you know crossbows existed? Did you know the Witch hunter had an axe? Did you know the Captain can use a 1 handed sword and prettend to be the wizard? Did you know Kerillian has a shortbow? Kerillian can use a single sword, why?  This.Is.A.Joke  Now, on to the specials  Globadiers - Globe rat resistance has been nerfed shortly (90%-60%) after massively buffing the globadiers. This has resulted in situations where if you have a horde and a globadier that you cannot spot, you are already wiped, and even if you do spot him, goodluck using your handgun to headshot a small, glitchy head in the middle of the horde, because they are just that tanky.  Previous to the nerf, globe rats still spammed enough globes and poison to the point of seriously injuring the players, but giving them a chance to survive a situation you are cornered in. Continuing on this trinket, it seems fatshark forgot the purpose of these trinkets, you have a maximum of 3, and on cataclysm, you do need the grimoire resistance, or you get 1 shot by a rat that will hit you through shove, or through the wall. You also need poison resistance, or once you have both grims, the sheer impact of the globe would kill you instantly. And then you have the choice of another trinket. So all this 'great variation of gameplay' brought by trinkets are a massive joke, even more so now, where you waste a trinket slot to deal with a specific kind of special rat, and it won't even do that anymore.  Packmasters - Ah yes, the ghosts of vermintide, ethereal beings that are imune to unit collision, marching towards you during a horde, ignoring every rat possible, grabing you through all the rats or a wall and draging you to a death that is certain, even if your team is around, best case scenarion would be to go down, and helped by your team during the horde by block reviv... oh wait..  After 300 hours playing this game, i have defended it constantly and passionately from its critics, but update after update i have become more and more tired and disapointed in the direction this game is taking.",

            "review_text": "Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide is a four player cooperative action game that takes the player to the fantasy realm of Warhammer during their version of the apocalypse, and the first stage, the Skaven rat hordes.   Pros -Beautiful graphics -Rich story -True to source material -Very fun cooperative play -Variety of game play, offers challenging levels -Grimoire collectable system adds difficulty and reward -Character play/ build options -Balanced, varied characters -Great developer support, helpful -DLC handled very well  Cons -Loot system (better but still eh) -Player forced to farm few same levels to progress their equipment (Fatshark has addressed this) -Declining player base   Graphics = 10/10 The graphics are great and current with generation. The visuals and imagery are absolutely amazing, the developers really treat it as a passion and add vast amounts of detail into the level designs.  Music = 7/10 The music is done well and appropriate to the setting, however the tavern music can get old fast while waiting for a lobby. During suspenseful moments in a level the music really adds to the atmosphere.  Cinematics = 7/10 There are not a whole lot of cinematics found in the game, the few that are present are gorgeous graphics and add to the overall experience of the game.  Story 10/10 The story of Vermintide is really where it flourishes. While progressing through the levels as they are made available, you follow the story of your band of rag-tag heroes fighting off the Skaven hordes in the town of Ubersreik during the early days of the End Times. What really makes the story so amazing in this game is the lore from the Warhammer franchise and how well developers, Fatshark, has done in utilising the source material.   Content 8/10 There is tons of content to keep you replaying, a good variety of levels and level types, as well as loot/ equipment progression (however frustrating the loot system can be). Fatshark has also struck gold in how to handle DLC, there have been a share of free updates and content, and a couple paid DLC. The paid DLC offers a good amount of content for the price, but what really makes it unique is the fact that if you own the DLC, anyone who joins your game can benefit and play the content and vice versa.  Controls 9/10 The controls are easily learned, and complicated to master, in a good way. The controls are fluent and easy to jump into the game with, as well as the further you progress in game difficulty the more you are required to use advanced controls and tactics.   Gameplay 8/10 Character selection offers plenty of variety from character to character, as well as weapon selection offers varied play styles within each character. Each level has its own goals to meet to progress and finish, with some repeated mechanics, but enough uniqueness to set each level apart. Added in an update was the Last Stand mode which offered a round based survival game mode which brought its own large amount of gameplay.  Overall 8.5/10 Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide can be paralleled in playstyle to Left 4 Dead with its four player coop mission based survival gameplay. However Vermintide goes the distance in setting itself away from Left 4 Dead and other games in the genre with its excellent story, content, character options, and fluent melee combat. I couldn't recommend this game more to fans of either the coop action/ survival genre, fans of the Warhammer universe, or even fans of lore rich dark fantasy.",

It's a 4 player co-op PVE game where you and 3 other players take on an army of Warhammer rat-men as you traverse various levels and challenges. Your reward for success is loot, which you can upgrade over time, or use to get alternative loot. While I've quite enjoyed the game it has always had a number of bugs, performance problems and stabilitiy issues, none of which have affected me greatly enough to have soured my experience with the game. It is not for everyone due largely to the repetitiveness of the loot grind and lack of variety in the stages and game modes, but if you enjoy fast paced action, challenge and loot acquisition this might be one worth checking out.  As an additional piece of information you will want a fairly beefy PC (on the CPU &amp; GPU side) to run this game as it tends to perform worse with lower settings (or at least that's been my observation). Also, I played through the majority of the game with at least one friend.

Unlike a lot of people for whom the LFD and LFD2 novelty has worn off and are depressed that it is now occupied by armies of angry 15 year olds , I can not bash that game because it is still quite simply one of the best co-op games ever made. Yes Vermintide is the same in that the basic mechanics for surviving (and reviving) and working as a group are there, how to take down different types of enemies that may even be similar to enemies in LFD as well. Both have tanks, spitting, leaping , tackling and dragging enemies and tons of plain cannon fodder types. Both have an overall atmosphere that they have nailed perfectly , but that is where the differences start to shine.  First off in LFD you are generally crapping your pants through most of it and the feeling of being hopelessly screwed but maybe possibly making it if you tread lightly and carefully and play from a survivalist aspect, which of course is perfect for its horror setting. Never in LFD though have I watched other players in battle and been in awe of what I saw.  I don't know how many times in Vermintide I have been in situations when I kind of paused to soak in the fight going on around me and stood in wonder at the sheer level of bad-assery I was priviledged to. Part of that comes down to the fact that while LFD was primarily shooting and melee was only secondary, in Vermintide just the opposite is true and the combat mechanics are designed to reflect it. It definitely adds to the feeling of being super powerful that the game theme wants you to have. The first day I played and got a real feel for the combat mechanics and who my favorite characters and weapons were, I must have repeated five times in every match 'This is so F#%ing cool!' Where Vermintide differs completely is that it uses a loot system that utilizes forging, enchanting and upgrading for your drops.(Which has been greatly overhauled since launch for the better apparently)  Bought this at the winter sale but unlike me I would actually recommend paying full price for this game, it's worth every damn penny and the devs seem to be pretty keen on continued support.  If you're a LFD fan, get it! If you're a Warhammer fan, get it! If you like Warhammer and are into LFD games, you don't even have a choice.",

            "review_text": "A big budget title made by the creators of Left4Dead by the name of Evolve launched earlier this year to much negativity due to it's sickening lack of content, lackluster multiplayer modes, disappointing business practices, manipulative marketing campaign, and several hundred dollars worth of DLC skin and character packs. Now the game is all but abandoned and it was pimped out to be the next best thing since sliced bread.  Now, here comes a long another Left4Dead style, horde based, class based, multiplayer coop heavy title by an indie dev known mostly for RPG's, and by god does it put Evolve to shame. On top of not only looking better visually, having a good amount of content, better gameplay with more satisfying classes, more weapon variety, more enemy variety, better pacing, and even better written dialog between characters, it is all being sold for $30. In an age when a title like this could be sold for twice that with about $50 worth in season pass garbage and skins if sold by a big budget publisher, one has to wonder what world these developers over at FatShark even came from.  The answer? The world of Warhammer son! The attention to detail is bar none to only the Relic Dawn of War and Space Marine titles. The setting is great, with highly detailed locales filled with secret passageways, chests, alternate routes, houses, rooftops, sewers, forests, harbors, magic lairs, YOU NAME IT! The controls are fluid and extremely satisfying. The combat is visceral and diverse while not feeling too complex or overly simplified. It looks great, and it sounds great with excellent voice acting from the entire cast with lines of dialog making this old (Mid 20's) Warhammer fanboy wheep with joyful tears of manliness.   Sadly the game is not perfect (Knew this was coming) as it suffers from numerous bugs and performance issues, but nothing game breaking. While the loot in the game is interesting and extremely satisfying to get, it is sadly hampered by RNG dice rolls that will happily screw you over as much as reward you. The grind is real, my commrads, and the community is sadly as RNG as the loot drops since you have a high chance of running into A-HOLES that kick you randomly, curse you through the chat (Mute your damn mics, I mean it), or never stop boasting about how they played the game in beta and/or how high their level is. Play with friends ladies and gentlemen, the game is cheap enough to afford at least two people. The bots are horrible to deal with, never leaving your side, and never picking up Tomes (Essential to have better luck with RNG) nor healing themselves or even YOU appropriatly.  Despite all that the game is a freaking blast to play through. Grab some friends, grab some mead and have a bloody good time for hours and hours of grind, fun, and rat murdering. Think the Orchid man if he was written by Tolkien.   8/10. Can easily be higher once the devs churn out those free content updates and DLC (which I will happily support)!",

            "review_text": "TL;DR the only difficulty mode that offers any challenge is almost literally impossible. Game has massive bugs and stability problems. Dev's seem very inexperienced. Customer service is ♥♥♥♥. Don't play this game right now.   I used to enjoy this game quite a lot, but the devs seem hell bent on making it the most difficult game possible with little to no reward. The highest difficulty, Cataclysm, is nearly impossible for like 97% of the player base (check achievements) and Cataclysm is the only reliable way to get the best loot, which is a shame because you need more luck than skill to conquer Cataclysm maps with any frequency. Every difficulty up to Cataclysm is a joke and Cataclysm is absolutely brutal. You need a team of people with high end gear and who know every trick for the map in order to even have a chance and then, the game might randomly spawn Assassins (think Jockey from L4D2) as a sort of '♥♥♥♥ you'. This can happen in the first 3 minutes or the last 10 seconds, literally.   The game has several bugs that make it even more difficult and unreliable, such as randomly dying for no reason whatsoever, invisible rats at times, rats that don't care about walls/objects/height differences and will glitch to attack you, etc.   Finally, their first 'DLC' that they released was free, which was great and added some much needed features in order to adjust the stats and perks on your weapons. Then they released a hold out, wave style map. Cool. They teasted their next DLC for a while and made it known that it would be paid, but released no further details. Upon release, it was the exact same wave style mechanics as the previous one, but in a different map. It offered nothing new other than a different location that in no way changed how you played the game. I felt as though this was an extremely poor move by the developers. Instead of focusing on perfecting the current content and removing stability, balancing and various glitches, they released free DLC then basically a paid version of it that offered nothing new in any way. Great.  On top of that, their customer support is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing awful. At one point I had an older i7 SLI Laptop that ran the game fine, but would often crash. No matter what settings I tried to run the game with, I got the exact same crash every time. I compiled all of the information as requested, typed everything out that I could and made a support ticket, marked 'Critical'. It took them 3 or 4 days to get back to me, which is fine. They offered a solution, but as I was busy with other things, I did not get to test it for a day and a half before they closed my ticket. The solution changed nothing and was literally 'This game does not support SLI. Disable it', which in my ticket I stated I had already attempted. So, I opened another ticket and then waited 2 and a half weeks for any response whatsoever. In that time I just bought a new desktop and continued to play on that instead of the laptop. Eventually they got back to me and offered more advice, which did indeed help, but not completely.   Overall, the developers seem to be extremely new to this whole 'make game, foster community' sort of thing. I love difficult games that make me work for every single victory. I love increasing my skill. However, this game comes down far more to pure luck than it does skill. You can do absolutely everything perfectly and still lose because the game seemingly just says 'Hey, ♥♥♥♥ you, you're not winning this map'. No reward, nothing, just try again. Cataclysm is the only difficulty mode that offers any sort of challenge for myself or my friends and sadly, most of the community experiences great difficulty on 'Hard', which is one step above 'Normal'. Above hard is Nightmare, which very few players have ever beaten and above that, Cataclysm. Even fewer people have been able to beat a single map of that, let alone every map. The developers are fine with that, so I'm fine not playing the game again and leaving a negative review.",

            "review_text": "Update: 31/10/15  - Since the last edit, the developers have released some minor patches to remove some of the exploits. This is a step in the right direction but falls far short of expectations. None of the major problems have been addressed.  Should you buy it?  - No, not yet  Why?  The game is not ready for release.  - Terrible netcode, horrible p2p latency issues, numerous drop out, no host migration, unpredicatable AI, unpredicatable hitboxes, unpredicatable and unrewarding loot.  Let me first apologise for the long review. i want to give a fair critque of the current state of the game and to explain why i would not recommend this game. This game has great features, but the major problem is not with the feature but the poor way they are implemented. Think of someone having great ideas but says 'Meh, ♥♥♥♥ it, this will i do' when implementing them. This is the game i am reviewing. This review will warn you about the frustration this game will cause, possibily because of those features but mainly due to the terrible state of the game.  Intro:  Do you like melee? Do you like ranged combat? how about leveling and getting loot? All these sound like great things in a game right? Well, they are, Vermintide is basically a very good game. The ranged combat is good but not as good as other dedicated ranged combat games. The melee is tactile but not a good as a dedicated melee game. And, the combination of the two mechanics are inferior to games such as Killing Floor 2, but better than other game that are not heavily focused on pure combat mechanics like Skyrim.  What about interesting character classes? A teamwork-centric experience? Well the game is also these things. The classes are differentiated but are not as clearly as other co-op roleplaying games like Dungeon Defenders but is more varied than Left4Dead and other horde mode games.  So would i recommend this game?  - If the game worked properly: Yes. It does most things quite well, like a jack of all trades, but it is a master of none. Fun when it works, a well balanced game with a number of interesting features that have great potential, but mostly it doesnt. Allow me to explain.  Poor Net-Code:  - Imagine a challenging experience where you have the chance of great reward. You work hard, co-ordinate with friends or strangers to complete very difficult tasks, but near the end of the challenge... BAM!!!! ♥♥♥♥ YOU, YOU GET NOTHING! Why? Because the host disconnected? Because the host is a troll and disbanded the party on purpose? You Disconnected? You could experience any number of these issues.  Poor-Graphics Optimisation:  - For anyone without a high-end PC you will be playing on medium at best. Even then, you will experience severe drops in framerate. From 60+ to low 10's during combat. In addition to this, the poo optimisation has lead to GPU's over-heating, and hence, crashing the game.  P2P Stability:  - Most, if not all players, have experienced disconnections and latency issues. How often do these things happen will vary depending on your connection. If your internet is perfect this will still affect you. If your internet is average, then often. If your internet is very good in almost every circumstance and does no experience any of these issues in any other game, still often.  Un-Polished Mechanics:  - How about you avoid these issues most of the time? Do you like killing vermin? How about killing a rat but moments later your screen flashes and notifies you that you have taken damage. Why? Because of the horribly unpredictable latency. Swing your Axe/Sword/Mace: every now and again, nothing happens. Shoot your Gun/Bow/Staff: same problem.  Poor Game Design:  - Challenging games like Dark Souls are challenging but fair. Good mechanics, learning the game, patience, and practice, will result in the game becoming more enjoyable. But in Vermintide, these things are irrelevant from time to time. If the game decides you take copious amounts of damages you will. Can you block the damage? No, Can you dodge the damage? No. Can the player control any of the variables in the game that will prevent this damage? No. The game has unblockable, undodgeable, randomly generated enemies that can spawn during opening-cut scenes, behind walls, under the map, or any number of unacceptable cricumstance that will wipe your entire party.   RNG (random number generation) Hell:  - The loot system is far too unpredicatable and unrewarding. When you (If you) complete a map, you have to roll a set of 7 dice; this will determine which of the 7 objects you receive. The 7 possible objects are all randomly generated. Once you receive the item, there is randomly selected trait out of a possible 30 traits, most of which are not that useful, but a select few that are ridciously overpowered and game changing. Then you 'unlock' the traits which randomly determines the % change of it proc'ing. So far, that is 4 RNG hoops to jump through when receiving an item. This is more random and annoying than Diablo 3's loot system at launch which was heavily critised. You cannot control the loot in any meaningful way. The game does not take your preferred or weapon choice into account when determine the 7 possible reward items. Completing objectives only increases the possibility of an increase in of item quality (white, green, blue, orange, red) but you can still end up with trash/white loot in the second hardest difficulty.  Conclusion:  I want to spend 50, 100, 500, hours on this game. i really do. Can i? yes, of course i can, but it will probably lose my ♥♥♥♥. The game has potential, but it's the same potential as a wild animal. It may be cute and welcoming at first but be prepared as they will likely ♥♥♥♥ your ♥♥♥♥ up after a while.  This game is no different from the numerous other game that have been released in incomplete states. At launch the game is barely playable. Numerous game breaking problems, balance issues, and a host of other minor bugs makes this game currently a horrible experience.  Some have been able to overlook these issues. I applaud them, and it is good that there are people who are enjoying their experience of this game. However, if your time is valuable, and your consumer mindset is to pay for a good product, this game is not what you're currently looking for.   P.S. WTF!! this game is designed to be played at an FOV of 65?!?! Is it fair to make a connection between the FOV of this game and DOOM or Quake1 or any other game that was released prior to Windows 2000? Like seriously... WTF! The developers have stated this game is intend and designed to be played at 65FOV. A slider is provided but will affect the game in serious ways. Any increase beyond 65 will result in unpredicatbility of hit detection and crashes. If you dont have an issue with 65FOV, your experience of this game will be much improved compared to mine, but if you wish for anyting above 65, even a slight increase to 70, a nice even number, no. GTFO, not intended.   Edit: For those who recommend: Host your own game to avoid drop out and crashes? Yes it is 'a' solution, but should not be 'the' solution. Mathematically, a 4 co-op player game with only players hosting and not joining does not a 4 player co-op game make. This is something the developers must address. Hosting a game is a temporaly work-around for an unresolved bug.  FYI - I prodminately play with a fixed group over skype. This makes certain aspects of the game far more fun. Naturally we will enjoy things more with people we enjoy, but having a great group of friends to play with does not result in me or my friends overlooking the obvious flaws in this game.",

Leveling Feels a little grindy at this time. Limited enemy Variations might get boring over time.  All that said for me personally its one of the best Warhammer games i've played since Dark Omen days, the game feels right and plays right for the setting, the game runs very well on my Core i5 2500 / Gtx770/16gb ddr3 setup with no issues that i've seen (Beta).  The Game does cater to the power players a little but for every poor player i've met, i've met good ones as well.

            "review_text": "The game owes a lot to the L4D series, but the unique elements it adds really make the game shine. The best feature, in my opinion, is the different characters and weapon types you get to use, each of which lends itself to a different playstyle. Unfortunately, it can take some effort to figure out just what that style is, because the game's interface doesn't really give you enough information about your own capabilities. The game still feels unfinished in certain places, mostly in terms of flavor text and effect descriptions, but the gameplay is solid and obviously well developed.   The progression system is simple and enjoyable, the combat is fierce and fun, and the community is surprisingly positive and helpful. Striving for better loot and bigger achievements makes it fun to risk runs at higher difficulties, but players of any skill level can achieve slow but steady advancement on the easier modes.   The game has its share of bugs, though they've grown steadilly fewer as time has passed. Mostly it's standard errors, like characters falling through the level geometry or even flags failing to trigger. They've been an inconvenience on occasion, but only stopped me from completing a level once, several patches ago. Overall, I'd say that of the bugs I notice, 10% are frustrating, 10% are actually helpful, and 80% are just amusing.   Play this game if: You like intense arcade-style co-op games, you love the setting and atmosphere of Warhammer Fantasy, or you loved the melee fighting elements of L4D2.  Avoid this game if: You want deep and complex character customization, you're not a fan of random loot drops, you get frustrated in games where you die and have to restart the whole level.",

            "review_text": "For TL:DR, scroll to bottom for summary score.   Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide is a coop-oriented first person shooter where you take on the role of a freelancer who ventures throughout the war-torn cities of the empire, killing endless lines of Skaven in the glorious name of Sigmar. In this game, you have the honor of serving the Emperor and Empire; with sword, gunpowder, bolts, magic and finesse. This game is action-paced, and as many have mentioned this before: It plays very similar to Left 4 Dead, except the Zombie cliche was knocked out and you actually have more variety and things to do.  The cast: An edgelord witchhunter who sneers like a jolly ol Englishman, an alcoholic elf-bashing dwarf stereotype with an axe, an mysterious and agile dwarf-bashing elf, an old lady that lights people on fire; and finally, a poster child empire soldier who lives up to the Landschneckt namebrand.  The Antagonists: A wide variety of filthy and disgusting Skaven rat-like humanoid creatures, varying in size and capability. You have Skaven specialists which resemble the behavior of certain L4D specialty zombies; with some differences to separate them. For example, a Hunter equivalent from L4D in Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide would be the Gutter Runner; which is slightly easier to hit but can also disappear and you may not notice before it comes back to strike. Specialty Skaven like the Gunner has no distinguishible L4D counterparts; thus is unique in its own way. You have the Rat Ogre which replaces the Tank; but also you can parry its melee and dodge its attacks better. There is sometimes an armored Skaven which requires an armor-penetrating attack or weapon, as will be discussed further.  The Gameplay: The gameplay follows a similar route to Left 4 Dead; except it has more of an emphasis on Melee weapons. You have access to a multitude of potions which buff your character in some way, and is distinguishable from Left 4 Dead since some buffs give you more strength for example. You start at the beginning of a level and have to slowly make your way to the endpoint, and in between that is a struggle with skaven hordes, specialists, side-objectives and so on. The levels in Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide are usually long, and like Left 4 Dead: You can hit specialty monsters randomly with different spawn counts. Unlike Left 4 Dead, Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide offers some extra goodies to contend with, such as having a 'lobby' level where you are in a tavern with a chest to check your equipment (you have persistent weapon drops and gear), an altar to make trinkets as well as a forge to combine items (Of same rarity) and upgrade some.   This game rewards you with experience points and level ups, which allow you to have better access to more Trinket slots, weapon drops as well as new levels (assuming you beat the beginning ones). In each mission, there is a chance to loot a dice which you can then roll at the end of the game which may give you the chance to strike a better weapon drop. Unlike CS:GO, these weapons are NOT skins and are instead fully functional with different stats and function; thus you aren't riddled with such annoyances of pointless textures slapped on weapons you use. In the lobby area, you can form a group and use the interactive map to decide which mission and difficulty you want to do, and you can change your hero from one of the 5 heroes.   While the game behaves similar to Left 4 Dead, it offers enough unique experiences and extra features that I don't consider it a retextured Left 4 Dead mod. The level design in this game is great, there is more of an emphasis on vertical heights and bridge crossings; making the navigation experience a fresh change. The specialty Skaven as I mention: have similarities to the Left 4 Dead specialty Zombies, except some small details in their behavior and functionality. The game puts a emphasis on teamwork. If none of this matters and you are a Warhammer Fantasy fan, then by all means; you will not be let down by this culturally rich Warhammer Fantasy game. But let me hope that you do at least care about the background features and overall framework of the game first. One other thing: Every character has a variety of weapons to choose from, some are faster than others but don't penetrate armor, and vice versa. This allows for planning out your character's loadout to balance situations you run into, such as armored Skaven or hordes which need crowd control.  Overall, I am happy with the game and recommend it to anyone who likes these kind of games, it is a refreshing change from the Zombie cliche and definitely pushes in some fresh features that are not seen in L4D titles. I know I have compared this game to Left 4 Dead a lot; but there are a lot of similarities, so I felt it would be necessary to compare.   Pros: +Coop-Oriented FPS game. +Intuitive and fun level design. +Breaks away from the zombie cliche. +Inventory system and persistent unlocks. +Good melee system, good dodging features. +Characters have distinct capabilities for their roles. +Takes place in the Warhammer Fantasy universe. +Beautiful visuals and physics.  Mixed: =Only Skaven to fight, but the game is sort of centered around that. =Antialiasing in this game isn't that good, but you can work around with external video settings override.  Cons: -Some bugs are found, such as a Skaven getting stuck in a wall. -The game crashed on me once. -Some of the levels are too dark and thus difficult to see.",

Gameplay is fast pace and great fun with the added expeirance of playful banter between the characters. Characters a very divers and different but all well balanced and fun to play as using several different types a fighting styles. The characters themselfs play differently depending on what weaponry you use with them, the weaponry be in vast and diverse. The only part I have come to dislike about the game is the loot system whitch makes you grind alot to get the things you want. Bit altogether a great game that I will defiantly be playing alot more of in the future and hope to see progress even further.",

The game takes the very core game from Left 4 Dead, refocuses the combat to be mainly melee-based, then adds in a class system for variety and loot for both variety and incentive for replayability. How extremely well the Warhammer skin is done is just a solid bonus.  Pros -  The melee combat is fun and feels quite impactful.  The game looks amazing, doubly so for a $30 title. It's easily the best looking Warhammer game out there, at any rate.  Classes feel different and varied, but not so much so where there's a noticeably power disparity between any of them.  Item system lets you have varying ways of playing each class, and definitely adds to the replayability factor.  Plenty of maps, with a large variety of areas from city streets to the sewers to the forests outside the city.  The Warhammer theme is very well executed - everything looks, sounds, and feels appropriate for a Warhammer Fantasy game.  Cons -   Minor connection issues. Mainly the matchmaking can be kind of slow at times, but primarily it's the fact that if the host's game crashes it boots everyone back to the start of the mission with a new host.  FPS drops: the game runs extremely well on my rig - which is a moderately high end one - but every so often the FPS will just die. Sometime it's only a minor drop from my solid 60 (capped at 60) down to 45-50, but other times it goes into slideshow mode for a second or two before coming out of it and going back to normal.  The cons are annoying, but nothing too game breaking. Overall I would definitely recomment the game, especially for people who played and enjoyed L4D.",

I don't find all that many games very addicting or legitimately entertaining,but this one is among the few (proportionately speaking). To keep it simple up front for those TL;DR people, if you love or even like Left 4 Dead, I think it's a safe bet you'll enjoy this game (and if you don't, just refund it).   You probably notice from gameplay videos how similar it is to L4D, and it has so many of the same mechanics (inventory with two weapons, a healing item slot, support item slot, and throwable item slot, as well as countless other things), so much so that I at first thought it was made by the same devs as the games feel nearly identical.   I'd rate it better than L4D, it's different, yes, but it is also better imo. What does it have that L4D doesn't? -Leveling -Weapon keeping and upgrading -Interesting loot system -Five characters, where for the most part, they have varying playstyles, where in L4D, a character is just a skin.  What does it have that L4D does? -Glowing character outlines through walls to find your team if you get lost -When your life runs out, you need to be helped up by a teammate before the enemy kills you.  -When you do die, or a friend dies, you can be rescue or rescue a friend later on in the level by freeing them. -Elite enemies, remember Boomers, Hunters, Spitters, Smokers, Tanks? This game has rat versions of those.    There's more, but you get the idea, it's great, includes a free DLC with 40 weapons -and- some other goodies. On top of that, the devs have plans to extend the game greatly with expansions and free content, including but not limited to having new enemy races (i.e. not just rats).   Cons? Well, I'd say the maps feel shorter than L4D's maps, but I believe at launch, this game has more maps to play than L4D did, so take that into mind, and the possibility of future content.   The bots, they are problematic. They've gotten a lot better though, they'll still make stupid decisions now and then, like taking healing kits when other bots or you are more damaged than they are (but they also heal you with their kits if you are hurt badly enough to make up for it).  The bots used to have a bad habit of chasing elite enemies rather than helping a defeated player back up, leaving them for dead. They don't do this quite as much anymore, I find they're much more dependable now. I can reliably beat one of the maps on the 2nd highest difficulty with nothing but bots, so they've improved.",

Even when you host a private game with bots, if you lose connection for even a second you will be kicked out and unable to play until you're connected again. Also the bots are completely brain dead. If you go down, there's a very good chance they will just ignore you. You thought the bot team mates in Left 4 Dead were bad? These are somehow worse.

The active melee combat can get intense especially when on cataclysm (hardest difficulty) where a normal mob can 3 shot you. I haven't completed cataclysm at the time of this review, but tested the waters a bit. The game isn't really friendly to people who enjoy going 100% ranged due to limited ammo and fast enemies, but it's doable. My one complaint is that I wish that we could pick our AI and give them commands to pick up items or hold position.

Why buy a more expensive reskin of a game when you already own the game this is copying anyways? This I think may be the reason the game is struggling to survive. Unfortunately, the player base reflects that...  Since the launch of the game up until the free weekend. the player count has dropped about 89% according to Steam Charts, and continues to dwindle down each month. After this free weekend, there's been about a 12% increase in average players. That's not good at all. In a few months time the player base will average at a few hundred and by the end of the year probably stick to around 300+ people. This game doesn't deserve that kind of demise.

And that's a good thing, in my opinion. The accomplishment of completion is more meaningful when there's an actual penalty (lost time, and poor rewards) for failure. None of this 'get a trophy for showing up' stuff, you have to actually play well in order to obtain your rewards.  This game has  THE  best first-person melee combat of any game I've ever played; it's set in a universe that makes me nostalgic about childhood, and it the in-game character diaglogue's as they interact with each other are fantastic.  The mechanics of the game, being very much based on the Left For Dead franchise, absolutely punish you for failure to play as a team. Sadly, many people still can't seem to understand that 'play as a team' does NOT mean 'run off on my own ahead of the party so that I can get the highest score on the meaningless leaderboards at the end of the match and I hate you jerks for not rescuing me after I got grabbed'.  That being said, the vast majority of people I've played with - and I almost exclusively play in pickup groups - have been good people to game with.  Word of warning, if you are the type to be overly concerned with your loot reward then this may not be the game for you. If you spent 20-40 minutes on a run that was enjoyable and a great experience, but getting sub-par loot through the random loot award at the end will completely ruin what was a great experience just moments before, then yeah, this may not be your cup of tea.  However, if you just like killing an endless horde of rats, gaming with a good group of people, and spending time in a very well done universe, then Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide is for you.  edit: 5 months later, I still play this game almost every day. The recent Quests and Contracts free DLC is very rewarding for casual gameplay of an hour or two here and there, and the substantially improved loot tables from patch 1.4.3 greatly improve the quality of loot that is obtained.",

Ratling gunners can still shoot through walls on some levels, and Packmasters are still overpowered (undodgable grab and their movespeed while dragging is too high). There are still some issues with optimization, while I am able to play just fine, others have mentioned lots of frame drops during the 'events'. Still some crashing, usually about 1 in 20 games, much better than the closed beta for sure, but still too many.   Combat works well, you can almost feel the impact of your weapons on the skaven. The game rewards team play so much more than lone wolfing, which is exactly how a game like this should work. Music is solid and sound effects are terrific. Devs seems to really care about the game, I think they know they have a hit here and want it to do well. Teams can have many different strategies, min/maxing will happen but thankfully the devs did not make the good items rediculously overpowered, you still need skill to win at the higher difficulties.

I came back after seeing that the loot system was fixed, giving you better rewards if you play on higher difficulty (which was almost a year after the game was released btw), and i find that it's still the same old game.

I'm located in SEA, and playerbase is a recurring problem throughout of my games, but this game took it to another level. Finding games is hard, and since back then there's no lobby search, you're really lucky to get a lobby. Now with the lobby search is a thing, there's not a lot of people playing as well, and those who plays are either grouped up in a lobby, password protect the lobby, or quits after someone joins.

The bots isn't quite smart, and playing with bots is an absolute chore, since they let themselves get surrounded, get ambushed, does not avoid the big guy, and the worst of it all, their stats is the same as a human player. In Payday 2, while they can't do anything good except revive you, at the very least they can be a bullet sponge. In this game, bots can't do anything effectively except revive you, and they get downed as quick as yourself.  And there's no mods that can fix this.  So if the core gameplay is lacking, what else it is to say?  It also doesn't help that the equipment plays an important part as well. If you don't have high rarity weapon, you can't do much on higher difficulty, but if you play lower difficulty, you can't get high rarity weapon. Sure one of the update now gives you more control over the RNG, but it's still a major grind to get what you need, and since grinding requires you to play a game, and there's little to no playerbase at times, how can you grind properly?  TL;DR Buy this on sale and if you have regular friends playing it. If not, don't bother",

I haven't played in awhile but here are the basics of the game;  If you like Left 4 Dead, and you like melee combat, you will enjoy the game some. If you love the format of L4D, you will love the game. If you like grinding for gear in a RNG system, where you risk losing even your chance at a reward if you fail then you will probably play the ♥♥♥♥ out of the game.  Pro's;  *It runs fine in my experience, last I played was on a gtx 680 and a Intel 4670k and I got a good 60fps at high-ultra settings. Good looking too, not super highend, but you can appreciate the details.  *Smooth gameplay - hacking up the rodents of unusual size ('skaven' is heresy) that plague the city is fun. Ranged weapons are great as well, it draws alot of parallels to war of the roses &amp; vikings, so if you've ever played those games then you have sort of an idea of what to expect.  *Challenge - it is ♥♥♥♥ing brutal at higher levels, you will die in a few hits and the game will throw everything it can at you. If you enjoy a challenge, and you have a group to play with, there is much to enjoy.  Con's;  *The reward system is horrible, horrible, horrible and I think people that defend it are wrong; The only way to earn ANYTHING is to acrue dice by completing levels, at the end of each level depending on the amount (Higher difficulty ---&gt; more, collectable tomes also give dice) and rarity of the dice (difficulty based) determine your CHANCE at rolling a random item for a random class, with 10 possible items on a scale of rarity. Whatever you role, you will get. If you don't finish a match, don't have time, crash, or fail then well sucks for you, wasted time.  *No dedicated servers - host migration, crash, whatever you will struggle somewhat with the servers.  *Frustrating mechanics - The game is unforgiving AND Brutal, it can go out of its way to screw you and failing to obtain rewards while getting your face kicked in gets old quickly.  *Lacks creativity - the DLC may have changed it (with some new stages and a survival mode) but the game could have so much more; Why not a multiplayer suite with the unique 'rodent' classes being available to play versus your standard classes? Why not some tavern games to play while you wait for your friends to join you in the tavern? Why not a open map to explore or something other than more linear waves of enemies.",

Learning the nuances of loot acquisition took me one game. +Different Characters have unique mechanics and feel distinct. + The atmosphere is spot on to what a warhammer fantasy game should be. +Devs have been constantly at work, and their efforts are easily visible.  -Better matchmaking   - Better optimization of assets  - Item balancing +Can play singleplayer with bots... but why would you want to? +combat FEELS meaty and has weight. +RPG elements are simple and easy to follow.  Cons  +RPG elements are too simple. I would like to see numbers, not just sliding bars to tell me weapon stats. +hard to hear audio ques for some of the special skaven types. Even with nothing going on. +The story feels a bit disjointed. +Everyone plays the elf, good luck finding a game. +Some controls (like instant heal/grenade) don't work well.

All of the gripes I have are easily overshadowed by how much fun I'm having with this gem and by the DEVs obvious attention to the community and eye for quality.",

There are a limited number of levels, but they are all extremely detailed and as fun to play for a tenth or twentieth time as for a second or third. The loot system also adds to replayability, not because you ever have to grind for loot in order to progress, but because it provides customization and a fun reward for completing harder missions. The difficulty is also well balanced, with the book pick-ups enabling players to make things harder for themselves during a mission in order to get better rewards. Also, while set in the Warhammer universe, this is certainly not just for fans of the franchise. The rats are an appealing enemy for just about anyone, with approachably flavorful animation and voice lines. The player characters are a lot of fun as well.

            "review_text": "Ok, I understand how some people have said that this game is more of a left 4 dead feel. It totally is 100% like left 4 dead. You have special classes that represent left 4 dead special infected. The game is really fun with friends but with randoms it is meh. I will go down a list to show the variants and how left 4 dead is similar in the parenthesis since vermintide is the main topic here.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -Gutter Runner (Hunter) -Globe Lobber(kinda like the Boomer only thing is that this one deals damage over time without the mobs) -Skaven Ogre(Tank) -Packmaster (Smoker) -Ratling Gunner (I would compare this to a witch only thing different is that the agro is instant when spotted) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The game also has a levelling system in it that will give you items that you get after a certain level. There are also slots that open in customizing your character that will eventually open up items for you to use. For instance, you are a level 4 or below and there is a trinket slot that opens at level 5. (this is just an example, I don’t remember if that trinket slot is open in any certain level… more than likely not) you go to the end of a campaign and you roll for your loot (we’ll get back with that later) and you don’t see any trinkets that drop along the bar. But you have just levelled up to five and you get to roll and there is a trinket that is now droppable in the rolling sequence. If you have the slot open for a specific item, there is a fair chance that you would be able to get the loot drop for that slot when you have it unlocked for that level. Simpler terms, you get what you can use and you don’t get what you can’t even equip yet.   Now, about this rolling, every single time you finish a mission successfully you get to make rolls. In each mission depending on which one it is, you get to come across these items that can help boost up your roll. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -Tomes (+100 xp and adds one die with more successful sides when rolled) -Loot die (basic loot die that adds ontop of your normal 6 die pool) -Grimoire (reducing the party health by 33% and is consumable. Once consumed it will make the waves harder and you wont get the guaranteed roll on the guaranteed one die you get if you don’t consume it.)  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Certain characters have certain traits about them that follow with the Warhammer age of sigmar realm or time. The elf is snarky towards the dwarf, the witch hunter is no fan of anyone but the soldier, the soldier is the all around whatever human that just chops ♥♥♥♥, the dwarf is not a fan of the magic that the wizard can conjure, and it is just overall an odd alliance.   Now for you people wondering if there will be DLC’s coming out. I honestly don’t know but once you finish the only acts that are available, which hits at the maximum of four, there is an ending cutscene that certainly leaves and opening for other DLC content and I for one am excited for it.   This game is the first game of Warhammer that I have ever owned. I knew about it and played a lot of D&amp;D and I enjoyed the lore. After playing this, I most definitely want to move over to the lore in Warhammer Age of Sigmar. If you enjoy good ol swordplay with specific roles and classes and love the left 4 dead playstyle… get this game… I highly recommend it. I wouldn’t say that this game is the best co op game cause I will say that Payday 2 is more up on my scale but this game is really fun. Out of 5 stars I would give this game a 4/5.  ",

You fight hordes of Rats (Normal zombies), Rat Ogres (Tanks), and new types of specials (Smokers, Hunters etc.), doing similar tasks in a level as you would in L4D till a finale. The biggest difference with this game is the characters aren't just cosmetic they all have unique abilities and weapons. It’s got various equipment levels and trinkets that really change up your team dynamic and builds for certain levels making it new and exciting.   I really enjoy co-op games that bring new life to the genre and this one has delivered on it. I look forward to future updates and of course it has a few issues but nothing to game breaking .  So my short list is:  Pros:  - Great Co-op System that really pushes for great team work - Equipment to make it interesting and all players bring something to the table - Beautiful level designs and layouts that is very immersive  - Awesome characters and voice acting. - Pretty awesome community, very supportive and helpful with other players (from my experience) - 3 (counting the future dlc) different type of map styles to play which add variety   Cons:   - A.I can be really stupid especially the character bots, where they are incapable of moving at times - The Loot system can be very unfair; I’ve known many to not get good gear for having played over 100+ hours and someone who played for 15+ getting amazing gear.  - Some bugs and exploits, and lack of ammo in certain levels make some characters less fun to play.  Thank you for reading and I hope this was helpful to you. If you like co-op games I would highly recommend this game it has a lot of the same things you love with new challenges and features to make it new and exciting. This is just my opinion so please don’t judge it too harshly, thanks again and happy gaming! ",

This is a great game about booping rat snoots, and has a strong left 4 dead vibe while remaining in the Warhammer universe. The gameplay itself is similar, but it has a progressive loot system, leveling, and 5 playable heroes over 13 maps.  It has some things going for it: -Fun heroes -Various gear to play with -Plenty of versatile missions for it's price tag -A fairly nice and detailed dark gothic enviroment set deep in warhammer lore -Lots of rats and types of rats to slay -Incredibly well voiced dialogue -Sarcastic ***** of an Elf for you to hate  Also three real problems that seem to have been noticed by most folks -Performance issues, that seem to be steadily improving each update, but there is still some FPS loss on even high end machines on lower settings. -The loot system is basically flat out frustrating and most people are not enjoying it. (You need to roll at the end of a successful mission and even if you are lucky and get something half decent, you have to melt down other gear to unlock one of that weapons base bonuses, and it rolls for how much of a bonus again, via RNG. The entire system is RNG based, but in a way that mission rewards do not feel like rewards) -A lot of hitbox and clipping issues. Any time a problem comes up that causes an exploit where heroes can beat a mission earier or such is fixed within days, but issues like the Rats that can hit well beyond their actual reach, grab you through walls and pull you through them, teleport around, etc etc... don't seem to be getting much attention  That being said, the game is throughly enjoyable regardless, especially with a group of friends. I highly suggest taking a look, more so if you enjoyed Left 4 Dead or melee based FPS games.  Edit: There does not seem to be any content coming for this game fast; and that is really what a game like this needs to stay relevent.  Edit2 July 2016: Still no real heavy content for this game, and given the grind to unlock stuff, I would say it's worth a visit but not a game you will stay with.",

The skavens make for a great enemy and a well deserved break from the tiresome zombies that we see all too often in entertainment today. The looting system is what keeps the player coming back. Expect a lot of grind though, especially if you are aiming for good gear since loot is randomised. However, you get an opporunity to improve your chances for good loot if you pick up hidden tomes in levels. These tomes take up the inventory space that medical supplies would normally occupy, thus leading to some hardcore playthroughs on harder difficulties to ensure the tomes will reach the end of the level. Sadly, the random nature of loot make for a game that can feel at times unrewarding, especially when you gain poor loot after beating levels at high difficulties despite picking the tomes.   On a more positive note, level design is greatl Some levels are linear, akin to Left 4 Dead, while others consist of picking up items, destroying skaven buildings, or defending locations while hordes of skavens storm at you from every side. The class based characters propose enough variety to encourage multiple playthroughs with each character and that is what makes the game better than Left 4 Dead to me. I love how different the Flame Mage and the Dwarf are, the first being a crowd control/AoE damage specialist and the second being a tank with an emphasis on melee although he is able to inflict range damage with his crossbow. All 5 characters feel different and that's what is so cool about it. Writing, voice acting and music are also excellent and fit the game nicely,.Special mention goes to the all-too-often hilarious dialogues.   All in all, if you're into Left 4 Dead, grab this game. I do not recommend playing the game solo since the bots are broken as of now and will more often lead you to your doom rather than the skavens.   It's also the perfect game to set up a creepy mood for Halloween.",

            "review_text": "I never enjoyed any Horde-mode Left 4 Dead games, nor their rip offs, but this... this is something different and the realization why I like this game so much came with time.  Despite the title in question being developed by a very small studio, you can see they deliver standards of AAA industry in terms of design, craft, gameplay... Does that mean the game has no issue? Of course not, the bugs are still there, the netcode is still being worked on, BUT here's where Fat Shark differs from most AAA Industry. They listen. Whereas fixing their game, addressing jarring issues and just patching it all up would be a work long overdue and abandoned (just look at Assassins Creed or recent Batman game) those guys support their product and player base. Some weapons or mechanics were overpowered whereas others underpowered? We've recently seen a rebalance patch, fixing a lot of stuff! The Engine runs smoother, bugs are being gradually eliminated... people found the progression too grindy? The devs offered two solutions to the problem, first with forge and shrine, now with contracts and missions.  The new content patches are gradually being produced, while the core game is being improved and fixed to match expectations of the playerbase, while taking the criticism like grown men and improving their game.  And perhaps the most important is: the game just works. You can make a horde-mode out of everything, but where Left 4 Dead had to twist the idea of Zombies to make them more viable and exciting, Vermintide goes for obvious staple race of the Warhammer universe, which just FITS the premise perfectly, including all the special rats and challenges!  Where the game shines for me however, are the combinations of weapons and their traits. You don't know Vermintide untill you discover how a great-hammer, known for delivering devastating blows to just one or two targets in a sweap, can become a devastating weapon when matched with a trait, allowing it to instantly kill any target it hits in a sweaping-arch before, not only the ones damaged by the core model. Suddenly, you can transform a crowd control weapon into one of mass destruction. Double that with a trait which boosts the attack speed and watch the hefty soldier turn into tasman devil wielding a mace-of-death. Some traits allow you to regain health, other stagger the enemies, causing them to take an increased damage, some allow you to gather reloads for your ranged weapons with each kill delivered, whereas others are more tanky. Those combinations are plenty and finding your build of choice, finding this perfect team synergy of talents, playstyles among the characters and their loadouts, is what makes this game so engaging. I'm having multiple weapon sets, just to test and fiddle with what suits my tastes best, some go well with special trinkets, others are reliant on my companions, but that very fact causes the gameplay in Vermintide to remain solid despite me investing so much time into it.  As for Warhammer? It's one of most atmospheric games a fan of the franchise could desire, getting you to the ground level of a unique character in this universe, and speaking of characters they are so delightfully spiteful bunch of misfits, who aren't your usual heroes. Far from it! They got themselves in a pickle, and got to work out some way of surviving the Skaven blight at hand. They are ugly, battered bunch of individuals who in any story could be just as well anti-heroes of the world, well maybe with exception of Sgt. Kruber, who seems genuinely good fellow. Their banter is sometimes hilarious, sometimes delightfully sarcastic and they make sure to throw in some snippets about the state of the world...  On the negative side... well, I wish there was more content. I'm saying that having just played through the new DLC expansion, after a huge patch, but still... this game needs more content. Perhaps additional characters. I know however that for a small studio like Fat Shark it's not an easy task, so I am willing to wait patiently and support this game as long as I can, since the very inception I see the game get better, improve, get more stuff to play with, meaning the devs are there, listening to us! Show them some love and aid in the creation of Vermintide.  PS. God I wish this game get's a mod support some day down the line. It would be so awesome to see custom maps, or even some alternative mode where we get to explore more of Ubbersreik.",

Have had a lot of friends let down by the recent Space Hulk: Deathwing, and my thoughts are that for all the things that Space Hulk got wrong, Vermintide got right. And the few things Space Hulk got right, Vermintide got right a year ago anyway. + stable + very, very satisfying combat. Mowing down a row of ratmen with a giant two-handed hammer strike has such a satisfying crunch. + actual equipment progression outside of one play session + gorgeous level design + good voice acting, just like cousin Okri used to do, with enjoyable exchanges between the characters. My dwarf was singing old dwarven drinking songs as he descended into besieged courtyards so we could drop powderkeg bombs in rat holes. + overwhelming, difficult enemies. I won't say that they're brilliant fighters, because they ain't, but they come from EVERYWHERE and if you're not in top form then you're going to get overwhelmed very, very quickly. And even if you are in top form you might get overwhelmed anyway because of a random Rat Ogre.  The only major complaints that people generally have for this game are lack of content and difficulty scaling up their weapons.   To the former I can only say that 1) it still has double the levels of Space Hulk and 2) DLC has been coming out routinely that adds another 3 levels, and those levels have in some instances blown the original ones out of the water in terms of detail. The latest Karak Azgaraz dwarven halls missions were fantastic. Best of all, ONLY THE HOST needs to own the DLC.  To the latter, I think that the fairly recent Quests and Contracts system has sped up getting good gear significantly. Took me a month to get a really good hammer for my soldier. After Q&amp;C, I got really good melee AND ranged weapons for THREE of my characters, after less than two weeks. Only downside to Q&amp;C is that apparently you only unlock it after completing all of the Ubersreik (read: doesn't include DLC) missions, but you can do that on any difficulty anyway.",

The lack of population isn't the game's fault, there's just not a lot of replayability and the fun is frontloaded (not a bad thing, you can get 100 hours EASILY out of this game).

Not only is every level well-crafted, fun and challenging on any difficulty, the addition of tomes, grimores and dice that gives you an extra chance on loot makes the temptation to check every room and chest nearly unbearable, well-knowing that slowing down or separating is likely a death sentence. 'Is a peek in that storehouse and a potential extra loot roll worth the chance of being carried off by a skaven packmaster?', you'll ask yourself.  After each completed game, your efforts culminate in a dice roll determining what goodies you get for your contribution, a very satisfying game mechanic which comes as the cherry on top of a well-earned victory. This is how you put together a horde survival game and ensure that it'll be popular for a good, long while.

The devs are a small team but they do a great job of communicating with the community, both on their forums and Reddit.

The voice acting is quite nicely done and helps to immerse in the game world at least on the first playthrough. Like in L4D missions are much easier with a crew that keeps together and uses the classes well. Playing through the campaign on normal took me a combined 6 hours but the loot system keeps me wanting to play and i would like to see some dlc adding more missions and equipment. The combat mechanics are fun and the game encourages you to use all of your abilities and try different characters. Enemies work very similarly to l4d, you have your basic fast attackers, assassins, swarms of weak enemies and a big tank enemy. Since those enemies are not brainless zombies though (but indeed pretty awesomely designed intelligent rat creatures destined to bring the apocalypse upon the world) there are some more advanced ctitters with poison grenades, chokehold sticks and miniguns which require teamwork to be defeated.  I did have some connectivity issues which were probably host-dependent since the game has a system which automatically assigns a host. Failing missions over and over due to suddenly losing connection to a host is frustrating and i hope future patches will fix this issue.

Only concerns i have would be the loot system as it may not be to everyone's taste and liking. Furthermore, hopefully more gamemodes will be added to the game for a larger diversity.   Regardless, this is a fantastic game that i would recommend for all audiences. It will be a wonderful, fullfilling experience well worth the price to pay.",

'Oh, rapture bloodshed!!!'  Here is such a case.  Nevertheless it: I personally I didn't expect that this game will be so exciting. When I played this game for the first time, it seemed complicated, confusing and unpleasant with highly fast rhythm. (Whereas I prefer the more 'contemplative' games). In addition, I made a lot of irreversible error – so read carefully the manuals! But it captures me extremely! So, I recommend this game to all fans of all  Warhammer Worlds , like me. It really is a very difficult game - it challenges.  But it is also necessary to note that this game is not without its flaws, and I hope the developers will pay attention to it. Personally, I was disappointed the following things: - The terrible behavior of AI bots. Sometimes it just looks disgusting and humiliating. It's a shame to lose the mission on high complexity, due to the fact that bots are just standing and do not help you in a difficult moment.  * I would add the ability to manually control the bots. It is not difficult, but it would be extremely useful in the future when it will be harder to find live players for game.  - Very occasional rewards. (I do not like the lottery!) - I had a lot of difficulties with the game settings. - Fall of the game at the crucial moment because of unknown 'break ties with trims' or memory loss. Lose the results after a hard working I particularly unpleasant. - Inventory is not very convenient when there are many items.   PS: I'm still waiting for discounts on all DLC better, since it is impossible to do in this game without additional maps and even hats(!) ",

This game is focused heavily on its melee mechanics rather than the 'shooter' nature of L4D. As such, the skill level may be higher as it is required for players to be proficient in dodging, blocking and parrying attacks to perform well, especially at higher difficulties.   Levels are varied enough that each one is interesting to play through over and over again. However, after completing the game, you will find yourself in the pursuit for loot. Thus, if replaying same levels or grinding for loot isn't your cup of tea, this game will probably not provide you the amount of enjoyment that many of its current playerbase is getting. Ultimately, this is a L4D spin-off with RPG elements that certainly proves worthwhile if you have a party to play with.   If you are already a fan of the rich Warhammer universe, then Vermintide is a must-buy as it does such a big service to followers of the lore. It is very faithful to its source material, and the designs do just that. The characters are so full of life and backstory that gets you invested in them. The witty banter provides for enriching dialogue. The equipment used by the heroes are so rich in detail that it even tells its own stories.  Graphics are superb, but the game may not be fully optimized so only high-end machines can run this game reliably at the highest settings with an acceptable framerate.   Personally, this was my best purchase of 2015.  Edit: After almost a year after release, this game is pretty much dead. I suggest buying this game only if you have a group of friends to play with. Still a great game nonetheless. Not worth if playing solo.",

Playing Left for Dead as a kid kind of let me feel nothing in regards to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ loot, because there was no loot in Left for Dead. Why are you mentioning Left for Dead, you might ask? Well, this game borrows many concepts from L4D, (in fact, you can argue that Vermintide is basically modelled after L4D) such as the enemy mobs equating to those zombie mobs in L4D.   That said, if you are unfamiliar with the Warhammer setting, it is quite easy to say that there is only war everywhere and everything wants to kill you (on a less extreme than Warhammer 40,000). The enemy of the game, the Skaven, are humanoid rat people who are overruning the city of Ubersreik. The description of the game by the developers offers a pretty solid explanation of what's going on.  Vermintide revolves around you and three other companions (from a total of 5 to choose from, the Dwarf Ranger (melee/ranged combatant), the Imperial Soldier (same), the Witch Hunter (primarily ranged/mixed), the Elven Ranger (same), and the Bright Wizard (primarily ranged/magic). Completing a series of objectives to accomplish a mission, you and your party must venture through the rat-infested city to do so. It is quite fun, although replayability might not be a strong suit. With this said, bear in mind there are minor bugs and some kinks that the devs haven't worked out yet. If you can look past these, I'd say you'd love this game.",

It feels like L4D just suddenly evolved into this different world but at the same time, offers enough new change and a bit of loot based progression to make me feel much more invested in my character.  It has very intuitive controls, and a nice fluid feel in combat. While it's easy to just pop on and play and even do fairly well, there is also a lot of room for skilled players to set themselves apart from the pack. The visual and audio elements are done wonderfully. A great soundtrack to go with the maps, audible clues as gameplay notifications, and it all sounds very clean and clear no matter how messy things get in battle, except when it shouldn't, like when you're about to bleed out. ;) The graphics are great, nice high res performance, rich textures, and plenty of eye candy options if you want to push your GTX 960 to the edge, like I do. On an older card, like a GTX460(tested this) - you'll still get pretty nice quality video, nothing that you'd ever sneer at, and with very acceptable performance.  At first glance, the game doesn't seem to have the story at the level L4D did, but as I play it through, the interactions of the characters continue to bring out more and more, bit by bit, and it all comes together very nicely.   At full price, this game is absolutely worth the money. It will remain especially so if the developers produce some more DLC, preferably maps and game modes, so that it doesn't become repetitive.  If you catch it on a steam sale, buy more than one copy. You'll want to give some to your friends. The community is very nice, as a refreshing change of pace, but it still feels a bit small. I'll definitely consider future titles from Fatshark.",

            "review_text": "If you've played Left 4 Dead, you'll almost immediately have a certain level of familiarity when you start playing. You might notice one enemy pouncing a player rapidly, and you have to strike that enemy off of your team mate. You might also notice one that grabs a team mate and pulls that team mate away, around corners and such so you have to chase them to rescue your team mate. You'll notice glowing outlines of players through walls, and even two levels (that I've seen so far) where your entire goal is to gather items spread throughout the level and bring them back to the escape vehicle. Most of the levels have you going from A to B and swarms (hordes) of enemies will come at you randomly. The list goes on. However, if you enjoyed Left 4 Dead, you would likely enjoy this game.  There are plenty of differences between this and Left 4 Dead, however. Vermintide's melee combat immediately springs to mind. Although you can kill enemies with ranged weapons, most of the characters will be doing a -lot- of fighting up close and personal, including blocking, shoving while blocking, changing your position during small skirmishes to land hits and avoid them, and learning when the perfect moment it to perform a mid-range kill with your ranged weaponry, quickly switching back to melee for a block. You can even do a little quick movement left/right/back similar to Dying Light, which can help you avoid hits from enemies whose attacks would otherwise break through your defenses.  Four players can be in the game at once, and only one instance of each character can be in your game, but there are 5 characters. If someone has your character, you will need to choose between the remaining characters. This game doesn't really have a 'Rochelle' character (i.e. one that is completely useless and everyone hates), so it's fun playing the different characters and trying different weapon loadouts.  Speaking of loadouts, you will start the game with very little gear. However, each time you level up (supposedly there is no level cap), you get a free piece of loot, and every time you beat a level, you get to roll dice for loot. The quality of your loot is determined by dice rolls, and you use different kinds of dice based on the level you just finished. This adds a new level of depth that it'd be fun to see the Left 4 Dead series adopt, or makes me want it to innovate with adding something really fresh to the series, at least. It's fun learning the levels and where to find the secrets to improve your loot quality, and playing on a higher difficulty gives a higher quality loot pool to base your dice rolls on. Playing on normal was netting me white items and occasionally green items, so I beat two levels on hard and got a green item and a blue item (same quality order as Borderlands games). I don't think there is purple gear, but it looks like orange gear would be possible to obtain on the higher difficulties (there are 2 above hard!).  You might think 'What if I get several copies of the same weapons?' Well that's pretty awesome, because there's a forge at the inn (safe zone you can vote to load after winning/losing a level), where you can either break down the weapon into parts you can use to upgrade certain weapons, -or- you can 'fuse' five weapons together to create a new weapon of the next level of rarity (5 white turn into 1 green weapon, or 5 green weapons turn into 1 blue weapon). The resulting weapon is random, but if you fuse 5 of the same weapon, you'll get the next level of quality for the -same- weapon. The only thing random will be the upgrade trait you can apply to it afterward.  Killing the enemies is quite satisfying and each character has enough differences to make if fun trying different ones. This game is so unexpectedly fun and challenging. If you think it's too easy, kick up the difficulty. My blood runs cold even considering 'cataclysm,' the game's highest difficulty, because hard is pretty tough, and going for the best loot means deliberately picking up hidden items that will drop the whole team's max HP down to about 25%, so it gets reeeeally nasty even on lower difficulties! I highly recommend it thus far and look forward to seeing more players online.",

Specifically, levels gained after unlocking all the trinkets slots are in a word, useless. Therefore, any subsequent level is outright e-peen. Yes, levels after this point do yield item drops, but these items pale in comparison to roll items acquired at the end of a map. Furthermore, top level items (RED) generally are not as useful as lower tiered items. While the gameplay is certainly enjoyable, the reward portion of the gamification model in Vermintide is unimpressive and incomplete. With all this being said, I would tentatively recommend this game; however, don't expect it to provide 100, 250, 500+ hours for the average gamer.",

You have to keep moving while dealing with these hordes. They crawl down from the walls, up from the sewers, on the building tops, through doors and over walls. You can't assume one direction is safe and turn your back for a second. A rat will jump down between you and your buddy and start hacking away at you.  You survive, barely. You find what little medical supplies you can, heal everyone up and give everyone a pat on the back.  Then the Rat Ogre shows up. Starts rushing you so you fall back. All of a sudden something has got you, dragging you away from the rest of the team (while they still fight the Ogre). You plead for their assistance as you are plunged with a pike and set upright, all while your team pleads for their lives against the Ogre.  You all die. You go to the Inn to recount your mistakes. Maybe somebody was running too far ahead, or another was staying too far behind. You designate a person to lead the charge, the rest follow behind. The Dwarf covers your ♥♥♥ with his Shield and Axe. You have a plan now. You are ready to figure out the best possible way to deal with multiple outcomes.  Goodluck.",

            "review_text": "Vermintide is an excellent game that does justice to the source material of the Warhammer universe. The gameplay is focused on Co-Op first person melee / ranged combat with various weapons. There are 5 difficulty levels(easy, normal, hard, nightmare, cataclysm).    While similar to the Left for Dead series, where you co-op fight hordes/special enemies, it is much more than L4D. In L4D2 you swing a melee weapon or shoot... In Vermintide you block, dodge, attack quickly, push/stun, attack strong, switch to ranged fire / switch back to melee, the combat is just incredibly well done and if you are good at it, you can punch above your weight in game difficulty level.   There are a variety of weapons for each of the five unique characters, with some overlap in weapon characteristics/type and, some specialties for each that the others cannot use. Each character actually plays quite differently if you chose their respective weapons.   If during a mission you pick up important Tomes and enemy Grimoires, you will increase your chances of getting better items at the end of the mission. When you complete a mission a random loot table with about a half dozen items (I want to say 8...) will appear, and you have 8 dice you will role for one of the items (better roll=better item quality). The Tomes will replace up to 3 of your dice with better ones, and the Grimoires will replace up to 2 of your team's dice with a garaunteed roll in your favor.   If someone in your party owns the DLC, you can play it too without purchase so long as the host owns it.   I very much enjoy the loot system however, do not expect that every animal/man/demon/bunny you come across is going to be a loot pinata that will explode on death into swords, coins, candy, and leather scraps. The loot is found at the end of a mission. If everything was a traditional loot pinata style, it would ruin the fast pacing of Vermintide. The next big patch is also going to introduce Quests and Contracts, which will help get more specific loot.  9/10 would play again.",

Stick together with your partners and don't stray too far or you'll get smoked. Requires good communications to play well. The five character classes are interesting to play. The only knock I have against it is that it's a little simplistic after awhile and can get a bit boring. For an Indy game, this is really top notch. Considering that it's a PC exclusive, it could have been optimized a little bit better. Would have benefitted from a streaming-type game engine like UE4 IMO rather than what it uses. Still can't really complain though. Totally a good game that you can jump into, do a session for 20 minutes, then go do something else. Fun to play with friends. I recommend this game.

            "review_text": "Vermintide is a refreshing take on the Zombie Obstacle Course. The zombies are rat-men and come in a variety of flavors from fragile horders, to well armored warriors. There are specialists as well, the giant bullet sponge, gunner, AoE-pool, pinner and draggers, many are very similar to incarnations seen in other ZOCs. As with many ZOCs there is also equipment to be found around the course, that take the form of healing potions and kits, self-buffing potions (Damage or Speed) and Grenades  The warhammer background, brings a gothic backdrop and a variety of characters that while 2 are quite similar, each have their own particular strengths, Soldier/Dwarf can frontline shield wall while the Wizard brings AoE and DoTs for example. Each character has a range of semi-unique equipment that can be acquired giving some strategic choices when considering the mission or mode being played and what your teammates also provide.   Ontop of each character bringing unique tools to the team, there is a stratification of the equipment that can be earned through gameplay; lower rank gear bringing 1 modifier to top rank gear bringing 3. All of the non-standard items have some form of benefit that is provided. Most of which have some manner of triggering activity, hitting/ killing/ blocking/ assisting etc.These benefits run a gambit of potential abilities that can provide significant attack boosts: faster attacking, penetrating shots, multi shot etc. As well as Defensive and Support abilites, such as ally HP-shielding and personal Ammo replenishment.   This loot system is primarily controlled by a mass dice roll event performed after succesful missions, higher difficulties giving better chances at 'top end' gear. Its possible to stack your odds to a degree by collecting certain objects found hidden around the ZOC. These objects,Tomes and Grimoires take the slots of Potions, and Healing Items respectively, these increase the difficulty of runs significantly if all are gathered.  Unwanted Items can be used in a basic crafting system. As with each rank of gear there is a corresponding rank of Shard, gear is broken down into is matching shard rank. These shards are used to either enable the buffs of another desired weapon, attempt to increase the potency of the modifiers, change the modifiers on a weapon; or attempt to get an entirely new weapon, in a particular (Melee or Ranged) slot for a particular character.  The melee combat system is relatively simple, light 1/2/3/etc. combo with particular swing patterns which reward accurate swipes and Heavy attacks that take longer to execute. Blocking provides personal protection from melee in all directions when in use and your guard eventually breaks after stamina has been depleted. An alternative use for stamina is to perform a knockback, an important tool for controlling hordes of weaker enemies and rescuing allies in danger. Between block knockbacks and the dodging mechanic everyone should have a fairly easy time quickly cutting through hordes of smaller enemies, giving one or two others time to focus on specialists.  Ranged Combat is controlled: nearly all forms of ranged weapons have an ammo count, and its prohibitively low, though with the low ammo count comes a sense of potency behind those shots. While the wizard and dwarven pistols run on a heat mechanic with effectively infinite ammo the deadly effects of overheat prevent its constant use. This implies that for low health enemies and during swarms its most effective to switch to melee and cleave away; but the ability to prevent specialists from engaging your teammates as quickly as possible is paramount in a ZOC and almost all ranged weapons can do this with ease.  My most negative thoughts of the game regard the post-victory dice roll, the particular number you happen to roll is the item that you get. Ergo, if there is a shotgun you want on 5 but roll 7, you get item 7 even though you had enough 'points' to exceed 5. This forces players to grind far more then most are willing, and 'perfecting' gear takes an extreme amount of tokens (runs) or luck.  While Vermintide does not provide a wholly unique experience, the meshing of RPG with a ZOC proves to be an amazing idea that gives players a reason to beat Ultra-Hard again and again.",

You team up with other players or AI to finish a mission fighting through hordes of sentient armed rats and several elite monster harassing you along the way. unlike in Left 4 Dead though, there's loot to be had at the end of each mission. You can use said loot in next mission or use it as an upgrade/crafting material. I think that's about all the difference between the two. If there were more, it's possible that I missed it. Anyway, if you like both Warhammer and L4D, you're going to have a good time with Vermintide.  FPS is not really my forte and I very rarely play it. But in the short time I spent playing this game during the free weekend, I thoroughly enjoy the game. Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide is a good game that look pretty enough (in its own way) and runs quite well on my modest rig.",

I stopped playing when I moved to PC and never got back into it because It was missing something for me at that point, for one reason or anouther I never bothered playing it.  Vermintide has somwhere hidden within the game got that something.  The game play can be frustrating with late mission team wipes and borderline ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bots at times (At one point when first getting into the game before hitting the multiplayer scene I had three bots stuck on the same suspended cage outright refusing to move from it.)  The loot system is enjoyable with the different weapon types forcing you into different styles within the already different classes. As far as I can tell no two weapon types have the same use in combat (though naturally I have yet to test them all).  Even the weapons I suspected would play the same played radically differently due to how the character used the weapon. The best example of this is looking at the one handed sword which the fire mage(I forget the actual name) has a power attack that swings in sweeping arcs to knock back multiple enemies at once. whilst the elven equivilent is a straight up armour peircing vermin cleaving attack that deals increased damage on (usually) a single target. It should be noted that if you use bots then they follow your weapon changes using whichever weapons you have last used on that class.   In conclusion: - Bots are about as bad as you fear (bring friends) - Dear god the pathfinding! - Games can be frustrating when you die super close to the end. - The missions are short (ballpark 10-30 mins each I think.), but plentiful. - A considereable amount of weapon variety which activly changes how you play the game - Interesting, but poorly explained loot/weapon upgrade system  Overall I love this game Sorry about the huge chunk of text, its difficult to quite quantify why and how, but this is my best shot.",

Now after playing it for a decent amount of time, I can testify, it is really not ♥♥♥♥. It is good. Although there is no denying that this game has as many leanings towards Left 4 dead as a cheap tooth removal is a rip off.   Vermintide is in fact so good to the point where I dare say this might just be one of the best games with a Warhammer license ever made. The graphics are excellent, detailed, immersive and faithful to the source material. Something I would have never expected from such a small producer. The soundwork is blasting, on spot and positively disturbing, from Skäven screams to cracking bones being cut.   Gameplay is slick, satiysfying, surpsiringly deep with a decently high skill ceiling and both addicting and punishing. I usually do not like to dickride on games spotlighting the 'good' heros, since I like both rats and ratmen, but I can not deny that Vermintide certainly has a foot in the door here. Did not expect to like this game as much as I did. And it gets ballbustingly hard later on, even with skilled teams. Can be frustrating if you hate dice rolls for nontradeable loot, also has minor technical problems that can cause issues ingame or crashes, but it's not very common at this point.  Not a fan of the DLC practice as usual as DLC is cancer for the game industry by nature. Should have sold the full package for 30-40 euros and put in the few paid DLC's all inclusive. No significant item paywalls so far. Controller and Mike recommended, but not necessary. I played with Keyboard, Mouse and neither Voice- or Textchat and had little to no issues. Had a laugh though with the infamous Steam review of the guy comparing this game to the Rapefugee invasion in europe. I slightly agree, however the real Rapefugees are several calibers worse than the Skäven. Wonder if the swedecucks at Fat Shark are still out trying to censor the reviews. Guess I will know that soon enough.  Vermintide is an inexpensive, decent FPS style Hack'n'Slash game. If you like Warhammer or are familiar with the likes of shooter games, theres a good chance you will like it. Gets a 8/10 from me.",

Cheap, only 30$ instead of 60$ they could have easily asked for(I'm almost positive this means more maps/areas as paid DLC)  Cons- Play and get loot for a different class. Took inspiration from L4D WITHOUT adding Versus mode(playing as the bigger enemy Skaven types vs the 'humans') If L4D style games bore you... like me.. then this game's gonna get boring pretty quickly(took me 30 mins), especially when you're playing the same old maps over and over again.    Longer version: This game sounded really intriguing, looks fantastic, has co-op play, a rank up system, and craftable/customized loot.   Then I played a couple games of it and was honestly reminded of why I stopped playing games like L4D--repetitive boredom.  I used to love the L4D series, especially when playing with friends.

I bought Payday, and in less than a month and just found it... SURPRISE!!!!... boring.  I'm just going to click 'not recommended' for this game ONLY because there is no middle ground in the review system, and even though I personally found it boring, it still seems to be a great game for other people.   ***Honestly I like amassing games like a hoarder, but I will admit though.. this game is the ONLY game I've ever submitted a ticket for to get a refund.  Yep. Not even Journey of the Light, which was offered refunds despite if you 'played' it for over 2hrs.",

This game is riddled with bugs. Ranging from getting stuck in certain game spots to sudden crashes ( Especially when you're about to finish a level ) ruins the game.  Whats nice is the variety of loot you're able to get. The dice roll loot system is unique and kinda makes it addictive. You have different tiers of weapons, Common&gt;Uncommon&gt;Rare&gt;Epic. Get 5 of them and combine them to get the next tier, or salvage 1 of them to get gems which you can use to upgrade your favourite weapons.  The gameplay itself is Left4Dead-like. You've got different specials that all function like those in left4dead. The GasRat will deny an area with toxic gas, the PackRat will hook your teammate and drag them away to be hung, the GunnerRat would target 1 specific member until they are dead, the GutterRat will pounce and stab and disappear into the shadows when hit. Then theres the ogrerat which is the tank. One special thing to note is that there's these Stormvermin. Armorclad rats that are easy to take down when they're by themselves, but when they're patrolling as a group, you best avoid them. They'll surround you and push the team away from each other. They know how to block your attacks and they are able to hit you from a distance with their polearms. This makes facing a squad of them deadly when unprepared.  Tl:dr, The game is fun, L4D players will love this. However, it's got its fair share of bugs and if you can get pass those, you will enjoy this game.",

Unfortunately, they coupled their successes with an apparently hatred for their players. You gain experience for completing missions, experience tied to levels, levels tied to.. nothing. Okay, so that's a little weird. You also get the chance for loot at the end of missions - but only if you win. Except even then it's determined on a dice roll - that is stacked against you. The house almost always wins. You end up with a low-quality item that can eventually be forged into a higher-quality item.. that you may or may not even want (because the forging result is usually random).  Fatshark seems to have forgotten that a PvE game is about having fun - and that challenge is best added by adding new creatures and more devious creatures.. not by sucking the marrow out of the player's already meagre rewards. Success is so tied to equipment that most players will only play one of two maps: Black Powder, which is a quick to complete, or Horn of Magnus, which most players are familiar with the locations of the items that improve the loot rolls at the end. The player numbers have dropped precipitously since Fatshark patched the exploits that were present in both maps that made the loot easier to obtain - but they failed to address the underlying issue - why people were so driven to exploit their system. It's because the system is bad and the game is ultimately more trouble than it's worth.",

Sometimes your game might crash, sometimes you lose connection to the server for no specific reason and have to restart the game or even the steam might have issues which means no Vermintide playing for you. And let's not forget you can always join someone else's game, in which case if he gets any error, you basically lose all your progress and have to start over (again).

With a HEAVY (and I mean 3.5 metric♥♥♥♥tons) focus on teamplay and cooperation. This game is golden for friends and players who ENJOY working together. Unlike most of the playerbase who rather exploit and try to solo this game to get loot. (They have fixed an exploit and over a week 50% of the playerbase droppped. Shows something) But instead of a long rant about this game heres a simple list of pros and cons since you prefer those better  Pros: +(Personal Pro) Warhammer universe shown all in its glorious splender. Not a colorful bloody world but, dark dingy and +dank, with some colorful missions.  +Some well done (but still needs tweaking) melee combat (This is a melee focused game, Guns are more situational than a main weapon even for the Elf and her bow)  +Great atmosphere, Characters talk and bicker with one another, get to see some cool city scapes +Enemies, most enemies vary and show off a distinct look like the Gutter Runner (Akin to L4D Hunter), Ogre (tank) +Packmaster, (Smoker/jockey), Poison Thrower (Spitter/smoker), and Ratling Gunner. And each one is equally deadly  +Lobby, now this was interesting to me but could still use more work. You start off inside a safehouse/inn working with other players to survive the Vermintide, more or so an interactive UI where you can choose your mission, customize and upgrade weapons.  Cons -Toxic community, most of the games you will join it will be silent no one wants to chat with one another. From time to time you get a 'GG', or 'Halp me!' but apart from those no one likes to talk. People seem to be reluctant to help you and more inclined to insult you for going down. In fact the player base dropped from 25k to 11k after the devs fixed an exploit on a certain mission.  -Lootbags, idk what to call these players but this ties into the con above. The reason why players left was because the said fixed exploit gave players loot, whether it be good or bad.  -Difficulty, personally I like the difficulty. Hard is MEANT to be hard, Nightmare is well. A NIGHTMARE. Starting off at level 1-2 then trying to play on nightmare you are gonna have a bad time. The range of the Skaven are ridiculously long in melee, and most newbies dont know that you CAN dodge in this game. (hold down ASD and space and you will slide left right or back) But with a heavy focus on teamwork and noone working as a team. Players will have a bad time. -Bugs there are still many bugs that were said to have been 'fixed' Like when the orge attacks a downed player. That still happens or when the pack master grabbing someone from 2 stories up or through the floor.    Overall I CAN say this is a good game. But I cant reccomend it for people who play solo or matchmaking.  The community is iffy. The gameplay is good but not solid. Hopefully within the coming months we might get some new content.   ",

            "review_text": "I played through Verminetide as a huge fan of the Warhammer World. It's a bit of a strange one to 'Not' recommend, so I'll highlight why I feel the need to put that status there. I did play through Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide and I did briefly enjoy it. The zones are very detailed and immersive, the gameplay is hectic and fast, and the character interactions and voices are quite funny ... at first.  I haven't been able to figure out which one of the females is doing it, I suspect the Waywatcher, but everyone is constantly ripping on the dwarf. Yes he's a bit stuntie, might be an alcoholic and seems to always be the one getting tugged around the place by Vermintide's 'Smoker' (Packmaster?), but does he constantly deserve the same really naff one liners that she comes out with putting him down? Leave the poor bloke alone man!  Eventually, I requested a refund for Vermintide for the time being and I think it mostly comes down to my next point. The Combat. Combat between the characters felt near enough identical and it just wasn't as fun as I thought it would be. The severing of limbs doesn't happen nearly as much as you'd want it to, playing in this grim setting and often you swing your weapon about wildly as you're struck from all over. If you've played L4D for any great period of time, you'll learn that putting your back to a wall and fending off attackers, whilst defending your flanks, generally deals with just about anything they can throw at you, that doesn't take you out of your protection zone (Gas, Rat Ogres, Fallen Allies.) I realised early on that I was doing the same thing over and over, without really ever feeling like the enemies posed a great threat, or were overly sneaky in their ambushes. I suppose it felt predictable.  I feel this is a game that I'd consider purchasing again for half the asking price (which isn't a great deal of cash, but the game just doesn't offer enough innovation for its price marker.), especially if additional races were added to give the player some relief from killing the same generic clan rats over and over again. I'm honestly not quite certain why I find these enemies incredibly dull compared to the frantic, screaming zombies of L4D, but I just didn't enjoy taking them down. Perhaps the charisma of the greenskins or the deadly diversity of the Vampire Counts could inject some additional flavour into this game, in order to help diversify it up a bit.  If you've never played either of the Left 4 Dead games, you might enjoy this as a fresh experience.  If you have a strange hatred of rodents, I'd recommend that you play this ... you strange, strange person you ...  If you're looking for something that feels really satisfying when it comes to cleaving your enemies limb from limb ... I'd recommend that you buy Chiverly. The damage of weapons + Visual carnage that follows their use Vs The amount of enemies that come at you, just lead to the bitter feeling that you're hitting an endless wave of dull target dummies. With a few minor tweaks, I think this could be a much better game.  Again, worth a go, but as someone who refunded this game, I wouldn't recommend it to my friends with confidence.",

However, in Vermintide, you play as one of four 'skilled' heroes whose entire reason for being in the situation they find themselves is because they are the only ones with the skill and courage to defeat the rat hordes. There is no one else (save for the inn keeper, whose Inn is protected by magic, thankfully) left--everyone else is either dead or just simply gone. This plays out well enough, as most rats you can kill with one to two hits, as expected. However, it gets a little iffy (for me) when you have the uncommon rats show up.  The uncommon rats are akin to the uncommon zombies in L4D. In fact, all the attacks they do can be compared exactly to those in L4D. For example, the smoker and the Packmaster both grab you and drag you away from your party until your party interrupts him. While, again, not a bad thing, it's a little weird when you can't adequately defend against their special attacks, even though you are a stout and heavy dwarf carrying a giant hammer, or a mage with the ability to cast giant plumes of fire everywhere, and so on. The mechanics of these attacks on these types of characters in this kind of setting/genre doesn't seem to fit together and bothers me.  The game plays well enough, with only a few realtively minor issues along the way. These included locking up my computer the first time I loaded the game and a strange issue where my game would appear to freeze whenever I stepped into a very specific spot. Both issues have only occured once each, and the former may not even be the game's fault. Other issues are small annoyances like glitching rats which cheapens some hits on you, and the like. Otherwise, the game has played smoothly, even at extreme settings (it auto selected High settings for me).  One major feature that is nice is the loot system, which will be one of the main reasons you keep playing for hours. Common loot appears to be given after each personal level you obtain. After each map level that you COMPLETE, you roll dice for a chance to get loot. The more dice sides you get, the better loot you get. You can get 'better' dice if players pick up tomes and special dice during the map level and finish with them in their possession. However, don't expect these items to give you too much more of an advantage as I've seen all but one special dice still come up with only one good side, granting me only common loot. That said, the weapons appear to be varied enough to be able to pick some favorites as you collect loot.  In the end, I'd only recommend this game to anyone that likes L4D mechanics, but wants it all in a fantasy setting. If you didn't like L4D, you will not like this game.",

            "review_text": "As a fan of Warhammer franchise for over 15 years I was excited the first moment I heard: Warhammer co-op game, L4D/PD2 lookalike. Yes! Great idea! Knowing the previously mentioned games, liking them for being really addictive and enjoyable, I couldn't imagine, how Vermintide could be bad. Well, it could. It is, really.  You can't say that graphics or music is bad, these are ok. Nothing really outstanding, but audio-visual aspects are simply right. The end.   The main part of the game, the thing, that should push it, the water for the watermill, the fuel for the engine, the air for the living creatures, should be the mechanics. That aspect sucks. Why? Here comes why: - Linearity to the limits of boredom - Fighting system simple to the point of boredom - Characters levelling - pointless, because you really gain almost nothing with every level. Boring - Replayability doesn't exist. Because missions are simply boring. - Characters differences? Almost none. There was no big difference playing as witch hunter or waywatcher - felt so similar. Boring. - Customisation? What customisation? - Weapon modding? Weapon collecting? All praise the RNG-sus, as this is the way to go. - Equipment choice? Ridiculously small. I don't write about initial choice, I write about the general: you are limited to just a few weapons, that can be only slightly improved. Randomly.  Generally it is ridiculously poorly executed opportunity. There was such a great potential. The possibilities were endless: - Creating you own hero with some skill/class system, at least bigger differences between preset heroes! Something like support classes with healing and differences in gameplay as tank or agile fighter. Faster and slower ones. Tougher and weaker.  - The forge - weapon creating system that could give you some room to experiment. Maybe secret recipes to find in game or as a reward for achievements. The forge here is just disappointing. - More possibilities of ending the level - the choice of strategy, maybe different ways of going to the goal. - More open locations, less linear, some environment features to be more tactical.  - More equipment - armor sets, more slots for collectibles, med supplies, but as well tougher enemies (inflicting more damage), what would make the game more demanding.  - More appealing system of rewards - something, that would attracts you more. Gives you new possibilities to explore. Now the only reward is some weapon - great chance, that it is something you are not interested in. Even if you do, upgrading your equipment is, as everything, random. It's ridiculous!  Well, long story short: a big letdown. The game is just boring. Absolutely wasted potential.  P.S. There is a possibility, that there will be a lot of features in the future, in paid DLCs. It would be cheap and disgusting trick, because the basic game is just too poor, too simple, underdeveloped. Paying for such add-ons would be like paying for the base game, but part after part for years... In that exact moment it feels, like you are playing early beta.",

            "review_text": "  Played free weekend.  About 10 hours played and i have to say. this game is dull as crap with no actual abilities or skills to use.  the weapons are your only loot which are almost all the same except for a minor 'passive' that triggers rarely. a proc of 1~3% chance on a charged attack to heal for 5 hit points.... 15% faster firing rate on a bow. 30~50% chance your stamina refills once depleted...  What i mean to say is that there is litterly nothing FUN about the combat. you constantly spam leftclick or occasionally pull out a range weapon to hit something far of. no abilities to speak of like in diablo or any other horde beater. simply said its very uninspired and thats saying for a Warhammer game.  so far i have managed to beat the entire main campaign which is about 10 diferent maps.  collect barrels, collect grain, destroy something or defend something. those are the only missions you really have. most of the time you have to walk to this location before the mission actually starts but its quite liniair with no multiple routes to take.  enemies so far i encountered counts to 8 enemies that you fight. -the Gutter runner (an assassin) jumps ontop of you to pin ya to the ground and stabs ya till your dead. this bugger is really fast. -the gunner rat. uses a machine gun that shoots like a mofo on steroids. since he has heavy armor your only bet is to beat him with charging attacks (hold left mouse button) or have a stupidly powerful ranged weapon that 1 shots every enemy in the game Except the rat Ogre. -the Stormvermin are heavy armored melee soldies that often appear in packs as a sort of patrol that are a chore to beat. but with a trueflight bow or a rifle you 1 hit them all. making these really nothing to be scared about. -the Poison tosser dude (i forget their names) tosses. vials of poison to damage you and your enemies. often he clears out the trash for you so ya can chop its head off. i thought all skaven were immune to poison. what gives? -The rat ogre. this is your typical brute which takes a ♥♥♥♥load to take down even with strong bows and rifles. chop chop at it till its dead but if your targeted run like crazy. -packleader this enemy often grabs ya like some kidnapper and drags ya away till your dead as ♥♥♥♥. these often appear in between packs of trash so they are hard to chase down since there is No sprint option in the game. -trashpacks. there are 2 typs of trash rats. small ones that die in 1 hit. and medium ones that die in 1 hit..... these are your typical swarm enemies and are boring as ♥♥♥♥ since you hear them comming by the sound of a loud ♥♥♥ horn blowing.  since there are 5 characters doing pretty much the same ♥♥♥♥ each the game feels boring as crap. the loot is randomized and so you can get gear for a character you do not want to use.  if ya use all characters, then yeah its eventually usefull.  overall this free weekend showed me that i should bother buying the game. i played with my brother and beated the whole main thing but man was it lame. with no abilities your just swinging your weapons like a loony and with no awesome loot that changes your playstyle you quickly get attached to what your fav set is. specially when you only obtain 1 item per run which takes about 30minutes to an hour and god forbid if you lose! even then its litterly by the roll of the dice if ya get something.  i suggest avoiding this game. L4D2 did this a ton times better the only thing this game has going for it is the warhammer theme... and even that they slacked on.. seriously guys. no warrior priest? atleast let us costumize the character we are using!  if ya want a cool warhammer game i suggest Mordheim!",

Also, broken down in logic, you have to beat hard difficulties to get rare gear, which you need to beat those hard difficulties. You can also craft gear, but even at the second difficulty only material for white Items drops. Andvancing your gear still requires luck or grind with winning rewards.

You could definately play this for hundreds of hours like certain other games, and not get bored cause of how the enemies act and of course the different levels of difficulty.   It feels focused mainly around the melee combat with range being more of a secondary type thing meant for moments where you actually need it. (specials, rat ogres.) The visuals are pretty good despite myself playing on low/medium. The optimization could be better, but that's about one of the only things that stands out in my mind that could be better besides small little things which are more of my own opinion than in any need of attention.  Like; Their has yet to be any varying combinations in melee combat that I can see besides the standard one that comes with the weapon, hopefully that will be built upon where you have more choices of which direction you swing, and different combinations. That's neither here nore there though.  The controls all work fluently except for jumping imo cause it can be abit picky with the enviromental collision. I enjoyed the voice acting, and the animations are great for how they receive blows, and different ways the skaven die.    I'd rate this game a 4/5 mostly because I think the combat mechanics could be abit more immersive with having directional attacks whether it be by moving or mouse (Think Mount &amp; Blade Warband) Other than that, it's really fun game, and I'd recommend this game to my friends.",

Well it's basically a rip off of a few different games but mostly a rip off of Left 4 Dead, but... It's a rip off done right.  In Vermintide you can chose from one of five different characters, you level up but this seems to have no real effect on your toon besides unlocking slots to equip trinkets that have zero effect in game... You can loot, and craft, kind of. You get loot at the end of a round if you complete the round, if not you just get xp. So a slight rpg mechanic is in place thought the results of leveling up are unsatasfying because you don't really gain anything.  Crafting is designed to take a fair amount of materials to make anything good, which keeps you farming, er I mean playing.  The combat is Mele, and well. They got it right, in fact it's the best FPS style game that has been able to nail down combat with a swung weapon. Sure L4D2 tried, but they failed miserably at it. In Vermintide it just feels right, the distances, the reaction times, how I don't feel like I have to get so close to something that I've almost walked past it in order to strike it where it seems the enemies could strike me from almost out of site. That's right, none of that. It's balanced in the reach and you can actually block, push, and attack effectively. More good, It's Hard.  Why is that good? Because it actually presents a challenge and all team members must not only stay together but work together and have some skills to survive.  The playable toons are different, not only in looks and animation but different skill sets, and abilities.  So how is this a Left 4 Dead rip off you might ask? Well the special mobs. All do basically what the L4D mobs do. You have a tank/oger, Jocky/Task master, boomer, smoker hybrid being a /glober in this game tossing smoke bombs then charging at you to explode if it's near death, hunter/gut runner, The waves of enemies come in as hords, and they have patrols which are arguably different but it's basically a random mechanic designed to take you out or cause you greef if you get slopy, much the way the car alarms are in L4D.   That being said, this re-skinned Left 4 Dead game with a few inventive twists is fun to play, it's challenging, and can even be a little aggrivating if you are matched up with people who don't get the idea of working together. The enviornents are fantastic, the animations are great, the game play is fun, and really what more do you want.  The game does have some opt issues and drops frames once and a while, usually just before an 'event' which can ruin the suprise... and no, it's not my computer. Check my specs on my page and or note that I can run the Witcher 3 on this thing at 4k with no issues.   So what's the verdict? Would I recomend buying it or not? That's a hard one, it's a good game and fun, but it seems like Valve diserves the money for the blatent plagerism commited by this game more than that dev's deserve the money for only half ♥♥♥ optimizing it. I bought it, I play it.. so figured that would be the tipping point in giving it a positive review.   ",

            "review_text": "It's Left 4 Dead but with persistent progress, loot to keep you running, and meaningful class distinctions. Excellent level of challenge- any difficulty above Normal (and even Normal sometiems) requires tight cooperation and effort, but is not unbeatable with effort and teamwork.  The game also boasts satisfying hit animations for various contact locations on enemies, and the best first person melee combat I've ever seen. As a co-op junkie this is easily one of my all time favorites. It takes a little while to warm up to them, but once you do the cast of characters is one of this game's strongest pulls; their banter and comments in levels are always entertaining and interesting. Progress of updates is a bit slow but steady, and updates are generally of high quality and significance to the game.  Be wary of high RNG in loot drops (that's just how it is, especially when you are starting off and don't have the resources to use some of the later-added systems that give you more control), below-average optimization (don't expect 60fps if you aren't on a very high end system, but most people should have no problem with 30+), and occasional jankiness in certain areas (invisible walls, imperfect collision on certain rocks, etc).   All in all, it's probably my favorite game of 2015, and one of my favorite co-op experiences of all time. Highly recommended to anyone who likes co-operative games, Warhammer in general (maybe the best use of the Warhammer license in a videogame), or anyone looking for satisfying first person melee combat.",

The game tells the tale of a Skaven (rat-man) invasion of the city of Ubersreik, with ratmen swarming from the sewers, spilling into the streets, overwhelming the city guard and resulting in a desperate band of survivors struggling to hold their own and to strike back at the rats.  Much of Vermintide can be simplified to 'Left4Dead with less guns and more swords', but there is more to it than that. Some of the unique rats that take the place of special infected, such as the ratling gunner and especially the packmaster make for some really exciting encounters, with a pair of packmasters able to easily wipe out an entire team of careless players. The varied weapons, shields and abilities of the five playable characters change up the style of play, with the fire mage standing out as the most unique of them all. Each character is well-written and full of personality, which is conveyed in their chatter throughout the game. I especially grew to love the witch hunters glum look on the world as I played.  With all the difficulty settings, missions, last stands and such, Vermintide offers a ton of replayability and fun. I do have to warn you, though: the friendly AI is not much good. It has a tendency to wander off and fall into pits and die.   Playtime: 16+ hours (Multiplayer only)  Ratings (1-10) Visual: 8 Audio: 9 Story: 10 Gameplay: 7 Overall: 9",

But I suppose that's to be expected, the game is developed as a multiplayer game with teamwork in mind. Other than that one little problem the game is a lot of fun when playing with a team of non BOT players, it's a lot of fun to work in a tactically organised way, or at least try to, and the pressure of being overwhelmed by the enemy is great. reviving is also quicker than with past experiences in similar games. On that note I do recomend that you don't try to be a lone wolf, stick with your team, help them if they are in trouble. this is one of those games where if you are good to your team mates they'll be good to you and the reward for sticking together is far greater than trying to go it alone.",

If like me you're mostly planning on matchmaking, then the fun is a bit more random, and made even more random by recurring bugs which can disconnect you in the middle of a mission for example.  It'll take you about 6-7 hours to do all missions in normal difficulty.

While it does borrow several elements from L4D (four player co-op, fending off waves of a horde (rats), special buff monsters (see tank rat), objective based scenarios), it does manage to change up the formula a bit. The biggest difference is its focus on melee combat, which is executed fairly well. Swinging a weapon into an enemy manages to feel satisfyingly visceral, not unlike something you'd experience in Chivalry. There are still ranged weapons, but they are definitely downplayed in comparison. Other differences include class based characters, each with their own set of unique weapons, as well as some minor RPG-inspired mechanics. These are mostly restricted to loot-based weapon quality upgrades and upgradable weapon traits (a chance to heal on hit, for example), however they bring some welcome customizability to the game.  Overall, Vermintide is a pretty good co-op experience. The RNG for loot can be annoying, it's supposed to encourage you to try multiple classes, but if you like to stick to a class like me you'll feel cheated by it a lot, as it dumps gear for mostly other classes on you. It's a relatively minor annoyance though, all things considered, and the game is definitely still winnable without the highest tier loot. Definitely recommended if you are looking for a slightly more difficult and varied Left 4 Dead experience.",

The AI doesn't seem to notice when it happens either if you are playing with bots, and will also get grabbed in similar fashion, or stand there and watch. Having absolutely no way to fight it doesn't make sense if the bots are going to ignore you until they get grabbed too. Also, the only thing special about the rat is that it has the polearm to snag you with, so I dont quite understand how shooting it mercilessly in the chest/face doesn't kill it, especially considering other similarly armored rats go down in 1-2 hits tops. Don't bother trying to swing at it - it's range is also stupid long, he will grab you long before you get anywhere near hitting him, even with a 2-handed sword that otherwise has fantastic range.  Too angry at the game right now to write much else, I love playing and really have no other gripes, but this one aspect is getting so annoying that it is making me question whether I want to keep playing or not.",

I tried to test it out today and i crashed several times after some gameplay.  My suggestion is that you dont play/buy the game in it's current state, wait for the dlcs and read the reviews of players who played that 1 month after the release of the DLC.

And part of the fun is learning how to handle extreme hordes of rats plummeting on you and swarming at you and your team with the wide selection of weapons and classes that are available. The game shares some qualities from the L4D franchise and I would say it is primarily melee combat.  Difficulty levels are choosable from easy, medium, hard, nightmare, and cataclysmic...and they are indeed what the names suggest. Be prepared to have your jimmies rustled at times.   There is a cool forging system for upgrading and modifying your weapon arsenal. After awhile you will get a lot of weapon drops and can use the forge.  I am overlooking the fact that the game has [some] serious optimization problems and a few bugs despite being released officially. And this is only due to the fact that I have so much fun playing.  Cons:  -Game optimization is still in the works(from what I've seen the devs are very resposive and keep the updates coming).  -AI is not the smartest, so don't plan on beating maps without real players beyond hard difficulty. That means singleplayer is limited at this current time. -There is some toxicity in the playerbase, not too bad, but it's bound to exist in games that give a lot of freedom to players.  Tips: -You must enable VOIP in settings in order to hear or use voice chat. -At the moment the average person has tweaked their settings to about Medium in order to have decent FPS. Mess around until it's to your liking, the optimization will improve- trust in the devs! -Friendly fire is enabled in Nightmare and Cataclysm mode, and applies only to range hits and bomb explosions.

You may get randomly knocked off a cliff or edge, and your teammates will have to come pick you up. You may get pounced by a special infecte... *cough* 'stabrat', and your companions will have to help you. At all times, you may be subjected to a situation that takes away all control and forces your teammates to aid you. This is both a pro and a con.  If you have a regular group to play with, Vermintide is at it's best, but even then it is insanely grindy. Even if you do a perfect run, the end result is completely random (as in actually represented by dice). You can play the perfect game and get complete trash. Playing a bad (losing) game, however, gets you nothing. Playing through a 30-40 minute mission for another common melee weapon for a class you don't play gets tiresome.  But Vermintide has lots of potential. Whether or not that potential is realized in patch notes or DLC will determine whether or not I manage to keep my interest in this game. As it stands, Vermintide is a decent co-op title, and can be fun for 1-3 missions for an evening with your friends. I got about 20 hours in this game, and I'm nowhere near the top tier when it comes to items (because of the batshit crazy grinding). I guess they implemented this because their loot system was so shallow, and they wanted it to take their players a long time to max out.  Buy this game if you have lots of friends and a sale comes up. Play for a weekend or two. I'd recommend it if it drops to a 15-20€ price range.",

For example today we beat a level and managed to put the extra work into taking all 3 tombs with us to the end. No one in our group got anything beyond a 'grey' regular reward, despite having the highest amount of dice we've had to date. Im not huge on RNG loot, but i could live with it if recovering all 3 tombs guarnteed a minimum standard of loot (even green quality would be enough). Just as this point we feel we might not go out of our way for the tombs again.   As for people complaining about the bugs, we havent seen any beyond a couple invisible scaven that we still managed to kill by swinging at the air. lol. Everything else is crap you would of seen in L4D (odd clipping issues, etc)  Anyhow, in summary, enjoyable game if you have friends and you get it on sale, probably an easy 20-60 hours of game time here.",

One time I managed to complete the level finnaly (still at lvl 0 btw) and the game glitched out and lagged at the ending sequence, sending me back in time to the start of the level instead of showing the win screen, I was with a new team. You cant imagine how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off I was. I just now tried again to play hoping maybe this time I can actually experience the game since I still thought it was a cool concept. My team wiped again. one player was a bot for half the game and kept dying and then the lvl 20+ guys I was playing with just decided to not help my character back up and died alone. I am uninstalling this game and enver playing it again. Huge waste of money. I wouldve maybe given even more chance just chalking it up to bad luck and me not playing the best, but the gameplay is actually boring and repetitive regardless, 2 attacks just spamming and no depth at all. Its slow, no sprinting, cursor has to be perfectly centered on an enemy to hit them with ranged attacks even though im shooting a freaking shotgun (has 0 spread). clunky, boring, ripoff of L4D only with worse everything.  And from what ive seen of others playing even once you are 20 levels up you still have to play the exact same as you did at lvl 0. whats the point of leveling if it doesnt even make the game easier? and why are level 20+ matched with lvl 0's?

I do not want the whole game to be a walk in the park but if you cant even run solo through the first mission on easiest difficulty without having random run of bad luck to get a normal swarm plus a summoned then what is the point of a difficulty system? There are many other games of this style that give a lot more in the ways of content and I have to agree that its really just a reskinned Left for dead 2 or if you want to compare apples to apples. Gauntlet remastered but just as generic in the way that each class does not feel different enough when your getting swarmed. Even the rpg aspect of this is very very light at best. If this was free all the time maybe it would be worth time or even for 2 or 3 US dollars but not for the price they want it at.",

            "review_text": "Warhammer: The End-  It's called Vermintide. Vermintide.  Anyway...it's a co-op action game strictly in the vein of Left 4 Dead, though with plenty of robust ideas of its own.  The Warhammer setting (not usually my thing but brought to wonderfully twisted life here) makes for a rich and different take on the co-op experience with two major changes.  Firstly and the most obvious, is that instead of fighting hordes of the undead yet again, Vermintide pits you against the Skaven, hordes of fiendish ratmen who can wield weapons, climb over anything and come at you in droves. Naturally there are a few special types to add challenge and surprise, capable of ambushing cocky team members but they come in some unique, characterful flavours. They are a constant challenge and always fun to fight.  The second major difference is the cast of characters, who essentially fall into five distinct classes, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. In a rather pleasant change of design though, no character is too distinct from another and it's quite easy to tailor each one to your playstyle. You do end up with favourites but landing in a game as a character who's not your preference doesn't bring an end to your fun and I often find it quite fun to shake things up as a different character.  There's also a simple but robust loot system that adds some additional longevity on top of simply mastering the games base challenges by setting you in pursuit of better and more unique weapons. This also encourages players to seek out optional objectives like tomes scattered round each level which can be gathered and brought to the end of a mission for bonus loot.  Overall, Vermintide proves that whilst it adheres to a pre-existing template, it isn't afraid to bring its own character to the proceedings and inject some new life into the co-op design. It's a smart, challenging and incredibly fun game dripping with atmosphere and surprise. Great co-op games seem a rarity these days but for those seeking their fill, Vermintide may be one of the very best in a good long while.",

Let me explain: Almost every Warhammer video game in the last couple years had so much potential that you could have compared them with Blizzard games. But the potential is never used and the games died out very quickly. Vermintide is one of those games. Even so it has its positive points, the negative points are way too much to compensate. I wont do a list here, because other guys mentioned a few points and since the game is dying already, you wont need the information. But i can tell you what i do in the game. I play only one mission again and again, because its the safest way to get loot with a random team. Why do i play it anyway you may ask? Because its Warhammer and i am a fanatic, i love the atmosphere and i love to slay skaven. But thats it, wouldnt it be Warhammer, i wouldnt even play the game. I dont recommend it, because its not worth it. My hopes lie now on Total War: Warhammer and maybe on Sega for a new 40k game.",

A new host is selected and THE MAP STARTS OVER.  I'm sorry, but this new processes of releaseing games that are clearly still in beta, and asking people to pay for them, is getting ridiculous.  If you know you have a game crashing bug, at least implement a solution that transfers the host without restarting the entire map over. Or better yet... fix the constant crashing!  *Edit*  Had the host crash 2 more times. And no it wasn't people rage quitting, these are friends on vent with me.

The only reasons I don't is because it has three big problems, and that is that the servers are client based and there is no host migration at the moment. This means that if you go through an entire mission and at the last moment, even after completing the mission you disconnect from host, then you don't get any reward for that mission and loose all progress. The other major problem is the loot system needs some serious work, it's way too RNG at the moment. I think they could really learn from games like Payday on how to make a decent weapon system that involves drops but doesn't just frustrate the player base. Both of these things they have said they are working on, and when they fix it I'll definitely change this to a recommend. The last is that the specials in this game are highly unbalanced and even buggy, you'll get shot at and grabbed through walls, as well as just end up facing an impossible number of them at a single time. They need some serious balancing and bug fixing.  As far as the game goes, it's a very good game. The graphics are pretty good, which as a side warning the game takes up a lot of resources and it's not just poor optimization but also just the fact that they didn't really compromise the graphics to account for the high quantity of things to render (hordes of rats and all). I'm playing on a 970 SSC and getting decent high quality settings. The gameplay is very similar to the L4D series and if you enjoy a co-op game you'll have fun here. Sure, the community isn't always the best but I don't think it's the worst I've been a part of. Mostly if you stick to easy and normal games for your first 10ish levels you should be fine.",

Nothing about these characters makes them anything more than stereotypical fantasy fodder. No personality. Completely 2-dimensional. Also, unlike L4D2, the weapons and enemies feel non-existant. The swings don't connect properly--or didn't in the free trial I played. There is no proper sense of weight to build reality. The enemies fly and flop and really don't feel satisfying because it just lacks the basic feeling of a good, solid, connection during combat the way the best games deliver. Add to it that you're just hopping from server/room/instance to server/room/instance to join random groups of strangers in completely mind-numbing repetition of kill, kill, kill, and you get the point. This game is a valiant, if failed, attempt at the direction that many of these titles need to go--emulate the best, innovate the rest. BUT it fails. Hard. I can't recommend you spend one micron of your life on this game, but your time is yours to waste. Personally, I'd rather have a lobotomy than play this again.",

Voteban isn't even an option too. A simple solution would be to be able to set a minimum gear requirement on your own created sessions, to prevent the noobs from joining.

Warhammer, Coop, Loot...But the systems just aren't well interegrated, so you have a randomized senseless grind, but why?  The Loot part would be so nice, if it was guaranteed. You can be the best player of the team, carry it, be supportive and hint at all tomes and grims, but if you roll bad, it's just a white item for you. And if new players just ignore the hints you have no tomes or grims and everyone gets worses loot. Is it so hard to give good players a bonus die or pity loot if yust the last event fails with all bonus objectives? No. But one mistake by one player is often a death penalty for the whole group. Random players below ~30-50 are clueless and fail to follow even the most simple orders. Map fails, repeat, more grind. Even WITH the Sigmars blessing update you may get loot for your preferred character, but again, it is not guaranteed and you need alot items to get your wanted item stats. More grind. The grind wouldn't be so bad if the game was more enjoyable. Players don't have a good way to communicate better and you often have 4 Single players (chat is ignored and voice is disabled by most players apparently), big events are mostly done by using glitches and/or players with way better gear, enemies are mostly hordes who are able to clip inside each other, so you hit one rat or more, depending on weapon, but get hit by 5 rats clipping inside 1. Fun. Finishing a match without tomes and grimoires is basically a waste of time thanks to the low chances at the loot for dice rolls system, compared to the effort and as mentioned before only like 50% of players pay attention to them and even less are able to finish with them.  Only get this game IF you like Warhammer very much, are prepared to grind a lot AND have a group of 4 players who you can enjoy it with, otherwise the experience may differ greatly.",

However in barely 6 games (I.e. the first six I played,) I had more reasons to complain about the companion’s behaviour than I have for the entirety of the time I have played any other game with similar mechanics. I have played closer to 30 now &amp; still haven’t managed to actually complete a mission due to the SM bugs  I write this the day before this title releases &amp; honestly I hope this title has one hell of a day one patch coming; as is, the delivery of the single player experience is crippled, leaving a greatly underwhelming experience once frustration sets in. As for MP, I would only recommend it if you have friends who both like GW products and were already planning to purchase the title.  And for those who want to tout the Public card; screw that noise, pub is what makes playing with bots appealing.  If the State Machine is improved to an acceptable level, I would happily change this review to “Recommended”. This game, based on what it has outside of my concerns, is easily game of the year material (again that might be bias on my part as a Fantasy &amp; 40K player.) Now that I've ranted, I just feel depressed, so I'm off to take some meds.  Addendum ----  To my eye it appears that the bots run on the Boolean combat switch; which means when they deem they are “in combat”, they won’t: • heal themselves. • heal teammates. • revive fallen teammates.  • disengage from combat.  • ignore enemies that they can’t get to or at. • think it’s a bad idea to melee charge a Rat Ogre while they are bleeding out.  Some of the situations that tend to occur. (I would do scenario examples but it would just come off as more bitter)  Often Bots: 1. don’t act independently. (As in they zombie swarm every task, also this may apply to the following entries) 2. stop moving entirely. (May be related to combat switch, nee path finding) 3. stare wistfully at enemies out of melee range without switch to their ranged weapons. (Killing the enemy yourself seems to get them moving again) 4. won’t wait for a gas cloud to dissipate if a comrade is downed inside.     Sometimes Bots: 1. blunder in front of you as you’re lining up a shot. (Luckily FF and FF Collision is off) 2. run away from you (or huddle together,) when you equip the med pack.  3. talk down at you with info blurb. (Bit of a pet peeve) 4. ignore that they actually have ranged weapons and charge across large areas. 5. will ditch a pitched battle to run back across the map, to hunt down a miss spawned “Special” 6. use their med kit on a badly injured teammate, sometimes even when they are bleeding out.

Don't get me wrong about the not recommended, but again, it feels like it's more wanting than a thirsty boy who just went home with blue balls. Let's start with the biggest issue. Lag.  I guess we can blame my video card for this, but when I see my teammates go down to something similar with exclamations of, 'What the hell is hitting me?!' there isn't something right going on. I ended up bleeding out in a room after I was left behind grabbing some supplies because I started to get savaged by an invisible rat. Either that, or the inevitable plague has come.  Best thing about this game now. The characters. Not just because their personalities are good and they actually interact and talk with each other, but their unique fighting styles bring their own touch to any encounter. It's too bad there's only four though, and one has to awkwardly stand on the sideline wondering if the solution to all this is one giant glue trap with a gallon of peanut butter. Though, some extra people would be nice!  One of the other things that bugs me. I know, curse me for not figuring this out by digging through the loot system, but ♥♥♥♥ me I had only a weekend and I had and have Total War: Warhammer to play with. Something I really enjoy, I might review later, but I digress. The problem is that the weapons are much more limited than I thought it would be, they do change up stats but not so much on the styles. I figured this out because ♥♥♥♥ing hell I will NOT sit through repeating the same levels to gamble on a dice system to figure out the weapon variety is lacking. Left 4 Dead did start this off with tier 1 then tier 2 weapons to be laid out for use. Then Left 4 Dead 2 with random weapons through the environment...  But I did enjoy the selection of equipment before each mission. Like picking out a pretty dress for prom night. Except with more vermin, gunfire, and blood. ... Mostly just more vermin.  Speaking of prom nights, it shows that there were only a few missions you can do and survival mode. Left 4 Dead had a few missions, but the thing is that they didn't wear on you quickly because they were in stages, using safe rooms to be the goal and the chance for the game to load the next of your debilitating gauntlet.  Honestly, this review was because I was bored and sleepy. While my points are thought through with my awake and concentrated mind, I guess this isn't quite as humorous as the usual. There's only so many jokes you can squeeze out of giant rat men. That's what I spent most of highschool doing.        HA.",

The host issues remain, so I still cannot change the reccommended status on this review. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------  This game is entertaining, but sadly suffers from numerous problems, many which just carried over from Beta without being addressed. Fatally, crashes upon launch and during play are common, with progress breaking bugs happening with frequency also. Being that you receive loot at the end of each run, this is especially irritating.   Furthermore, when the host drops, the instance is reset and all progress is lost. Why not just have another party members resume host and continue the instance? Either this or a crash has stopped me from finishing a run at least 10 times in as many hours of play, and nullified each run.  On top of this, after just 10 hours the game is already getting very repetitive. There are only 5 regular enemies to fight, with most of them just being standard melee enemies who run at you and do the same charged attack. Minor issues for me include the extremly slow acquisition of gear (subjective as to whether this is good or not), lack of weapon reloading animations (cmon just making the gun dissapear below view is not up to scratch for 2015), sloppy AI pathing and movement, and somewhat basic movesets. Most melee fighting comes down to spamming left click to hit the rats before they land their charge attack, (they are either 1 shotted or stunned, so it defeats the purpose of using other tactics in most cases) and if they pile up the occasional sweep attack or push back. The epitome here for developer laziness is the fact that you cannot turn off music or alter individual audio levels. If I want to play some music as I grind away, I have to mute the entire sound for the game. What year are we in again?  Coming from other melee games like Chivalry, or other multiplayer coop shooters like Killing Floor 2, it feels lazy, and like a major step backwards. You'll get fun out of this game, but in my opinion it's one to pick up on sale, 50% or less.",

It feels very light when swinging a 100 pound sledgehammer and squishing a rats head open. It just doesnt feel that good. The graphics are great and the look of the game is great, its just that feeling that I am NOT FELLING LOL. Connectivity is good, and it runs really smooth on my 980ti. But the fact that it just doesnt feel right and also not to much character selection or weapon selection/customization kinda makes me not want to play it. Like I said it is just like left 4 dead in the sense of the playstyle and how you move through the levels. But the lack of weapons and characters and the general feel of it has to make me not want to recommend this to others.",

I feel sad about this game because some critical issues still have not been fixed, and these problems make me hate this game so much.  The bots are so stupid, when I said stupid they are super stupid, they will grab and heath themsleives even they have lots of HP, and they do not hit the emeies most of the times they just parry..... I know you are suppose to play with real players but at this state of this game most of the time you have to start with the bots and wait players join the party afterward. 2nd problem is why the empty chests still exsits? what is the fxxking point for putting so many empty chests in the game? When you are dying then you think hey there are a chest hopefully some medicial suppies or at least somthing else....... but it is emepty, and you will found 2-3 empty chest in 1 game. 3rd problems is the unbalance waves, I know they are random but most of the time you know you are fxxked when you heard the horn and the big rat run to you for just after 10 seconds of a new game...... and of course the most important issues is the looting system........ stupid dices, somtimes I don't even get a single point from this random dicing system....... come on, I am not playing easy mode the game is already hard enough dont make it impossible to play.  I love the warhammer world and I am happy to see the company giving free dlc but for the state of this game now the I must say I am so disappointed on these stupid problems.",

I cannot ever hit ready up using F2, I have to join a game in progress or one that has auto-ready on. F2 just doesn't work. Whatever.   Then I try to change my character and again, it freezes my PC and I have to restart. Finally choose new character and play a game and it goes well. We won! I got some loot and it was cool but super frustrating with the bugs.  I want to keep going to I join another one. Halfway through we all get disconnected and have to restart. Super frustrating. Then half way through AGAIN, I fall under the world and die. After almost 2 hours I played the game for maybe 40 min, the rest was being PLAGUED by bugs. Also the game doesn't run super well. I maxed out at 45 fps on medium settings using an i7 3.5 ghz, amd 290x (x2, SLI), 16 GB ram.   The gameplay is fun as hell but right now the game is terrible to try and play.

            "review_text": "I love this game and even though it's similar to Left 4 Dead (which I love equally), it's not necessarily a bad thing to bring a familiar element from one game to another before introducing new ideas. It's a nice way to ease a player in, instead of risking to lose people due to there being more than they are willing to learn/handle. While some people love games with groundbreaking new ideas that create their own identities, I think this establishes it's own spot while being something someone can pick up to play with friends who know nothing about it firsthand The fact that they can identify that it's similar to Left 4 Dead allows them to immediately adopt the core play style they are familiar with to be able to get through a majority of the game and enjoy it on that premise alone. From there on they can discover the things that are new and different like aspects enemies have and the pros and cons of different charms with their abilities, stamina management used between blocking and shoving, letting the caster cooldown or risk exploding because you need 1 more spell to save someone, weapon types, weapons with unique attributes gotten through drops, a crafting mechanic, a loot system and a way to make the game harder without raising the difficulty as a whole that rewards you (in a sense, probability can still screw you on a dice roll) if you can make it to the end(bonus dice, tomes and grimoires). I find one of the things this game does even better than left for dead is making the party stick together to maximize teamplay elements. The primary means of disposing enemies are melee weapons. They give you ranged weapons but they teach you to ration ammo which is generally on a much shorter supply (cooldown for the caster) due to the unique enemy types because it's better in most cases (although not impossible/doable) to kill those guys from afar while horde fodder is much more easily handled with melee. With Left 4 Dead I find people mowing through enemies and rolling past hordes because they can and doesn't really force people to think as much. Guns are everywhere and ammo is bountiful, people get screwed over more by people who HAVE to speedrun EVERYTHING and get the group separated or more so by the environment (death charges, tight spaces, etc) with the exception of a well coordinated infected attack (a feature not in Vermintide yet due to no vs but we may get there). Melee combined with the horde spawns keep you together where as in Left 4 Dead 2, it was more of a neat bonus. You only really used it if anything got close enough to you, were good enough to get the smokers tongue or were hopped up on adrenaline. Different paths can have different means of getting to places based on map memory and can help in avoiding confrontations and lead to potential items for current or end based gain (rolls). It invokes more communication between players imho. While I will praise this game for what it has offered, the only things (apart from no vs mode yet) I will admit to not being a fan of two things: no chapters/checkpoints on the maps and the rng loot dice rolls. It's all one long run and if you fail, you start from square one on the map or start a different level altogether. It makes the game REALLY hard to enjoy as much when you get so far or get a lot of bonus dice like items to see it all go down the drain when/if you die and even if you do make it, sometimes even with all the bonus dice you can get to boost your chances at good items, get boned because rng hates you like 50% of the time but it feels like 100% of the time and even with the level up bonus loot you get, it dosen't get good until a certain level point which turns the game into that much more of a grind unless you are having a real good time with friends and don't really care all that much in the end. Are the games similar? Certainly. Are they the same? No. It's harder for youtuber groups like these to really find that out because a lot of the time, they record their first time playing or don't bother to play/learn before hand because a lot of this is the fun of getting to play with friends and a lot of attention is more found going in that direction. All we can hope is that enough of what is made an obvious difference between the two is enough to encourage these groups to explore further, play more, and fully enjoy the games full potential while still enjoying the similar essence of what Left 4 Dead 2 gave it",

I have been able to get alot of the people who use to be big on l4d1 and l4d2 into a game which has good replay value and the same underlying concept of utilizing team work to get a know acomplishment. I would give this an 8 out of 10. Due to a few things needing to be polished, or lack what I would consider a great game.  Positive: There are many maps around (15 I think) which you can play, which is a lot more than the orginal 5 maps l4d orginally offered. There is a wide variaty of styles and combat choices that each individual player can play. There are 5 various levels of game play averaging from easy to nightmare mode. There is an upgrade system for weapons. There is a good variaty of enemys to play against espically against you storm vermin....... It also offers another higher risk vs reward where you can collect tombs (which take hp spots) to grimoires which lowers your overall teams hp to get better dice rolls for weapons and other trinkets. This game constantly keeps the player on the move, unlike in l4d where there were slow parts with no zombies or very little.  Negatives: There are still many bugs and glitchs espcially for special vermin. The pack master and vermin runner (hunter) are by far the most glitchy. From teleporting across openings, to having bad hit boxes, to not having shoving not affect them or your fellow ally. There is a drop system and basically to get good drops you as a player will have to grind on specific levels getting grimoires and tombs for the ones that do have them. This will also encourge people to utilitze glitches to get past harder parts of those levels which offer grimoires in the game. The levels that dont offer this, well there is not much reward in itself other than beating a level to get the final experience and open more levels (you can still get a chance of getting a drop, its just must lower without tombs and grimoires). The drop system is also very noticable in weapon damage, for example one of the characters I like to play I only have grey items (lowest level) it takes about 2-3 hits to kill (not a headshot) 1 average rat. Yet when I play with others who have golden level items they will kill the same enemy in 1 hit (not including head shots). Enemys seem to spawn ontop of players more than one occasion and sadly that can be a pack of storm vermin which insta kill you or even a rat ogre.... yes I have had both spawn ontop of me.....it ended badly.  Final: Overall this game is very fun despite the very apparent glitches and screwed up special vermin. If some of the items listed in the negatives area be improved I think the game will do very well. Espeically not having tombs, or grimoires on all levels. As long as FatSHark provides good support and timely fixes i think this game will be high up on those who enjoyed l4d's list (I just hope Fatshark doesnt make the same mistake that TRS did with evolve). This game provides alot of potentinal just as evolve did on intial release, but because of the lack of support of inherent glitches, and imbalances in the game is one of the main reasons why most later on gamers who stuck to higher levels of playing shyed away from the game.",

I read many times that people are not exited due to the looting system. In my opinion it is great. You may roll at every end of a mission with up to seven dice. You can upgrade the dice's chance if you collect tomes and grimoires in the missions which invites to explore the maps. Unfortunatelly, the tomes and grimoires are ever at the same position. It would be better and more exciting, if these items were on randomly positions, so the players have to explore every corner of the maps.  All in all, I would recommend this game.

It plays very similar: 4 player co-op, special Skaven with similar abilities as the infected attempting to disrupt your positioning, health and special items scattered around randomly to help you carry on.  In combat, it's much more melee-centric. Ammunition is limited, and many classes are built with stronger melee in mind, so their ranged choices are for dealing with special Skaven quickly, and less effective against the hordes. Waywatcher, Witch Hunter, and Bright Wizard have weapons that can make crowd control easier. The specialization of each character improves on the L4D model by not giving everyone the same vulnerabilities and dependant on the same strategies for survival.  I've yet to play all the missions available, yet, but there appears to be more campaigns than L4D + L4D2 + DLC combined. In addition, there's a simple loot and reward system that takes mere moments to manage between missions, and in most cases, you'll directly go to another mission rather than waste time not earning loot for upgrades.

GJ fatshark!  I had to make sure this wasn't early access before writing this. This game is VERY buggy. But it is fun... It just needs some serious bug fixes. If you're OK with the hassle, it might be worthwhile. If you get frustrated by constant bugs that interfere with gameplay and progression, give it a few patches.  Here's what I think is wrong with the game:  1) PUSH TO TALK IS DISABLED BY DEFAULT. WHAT. THE. ♥♥♥♥. Not just your own voice, but you can't hear others either!! Make sure you turn this on IMMEDIATELY. Every game there's someone who can't hear the rest of the team and we have to type. This isn't the kind of game where you can stop to type.  2) Tabbing out of the game, especially when loading, can cause your cursor to stick in first person mode. If you have two monitors, it will let you click the other monitor, tabbing you out of the game. This means you can't turn to the right. Fixed by opening your inventory, which you can only do at the start of the map.  3) It's crashed several times so far. Any progress is lost. Your player slot is pretty much instantly filled, which sucks if you were playing with a friend.  4) If the host leaves, you restart the level. This happens more frequently, especially on hard difficulty if the host doesn't get their way.  5) Hook rats can pull allies through some walls. If this happens, you can't save the ally.  6) The hunter rats very often tackle a player and fly up 200 feet in the air. They come back down, but it's a ton of free damage from the duration of the jump. It's also just stupid nonense, they jump straight up into the air all glitchily.  7) There's a LOT of ledges that are maybe 2 inches tall, but you get hung up on them. Some of them are in really obvious places that you have to pass.  8) You have to watch 4-5 unskippable cutscenes every time you open the game. Even if you were just changing graphic settings or if you had just crashed. 'It's unskippable because it's loading' they say. No it isn't. I've got this game on an SSD, it loads in a few seconds.  9) The items you get for levelling seem to be random. The first few levels I got repeats of the starter gear. Incredibly stupid when you're excited to get some new types of weapons.",

            "review_text": "'The tide rises, and finds me ready' -Bardin Goreksson  Picture this: you and three friends must run, hack, and blast your way across a city overrun with foul creatures clamouring for your blood. Sound familiar?  Perhaps the most fully realised on-screen recreation of the Warhammer Fantasy universe yet made, Vermintide excels in its world building, bringing to the table a combination of excellent hack 'n slash action (Fatshark does first-person melee combat like no-one else), a selection of varied, finely balanced levels, and a meticulous attention to character and environment design. It's also a shameless homage to the Left 4 Dead series, taking most of its key game mechanics from Valve's co-op zombie survival franchise. That's not a bad thing though, and there is still much to differentiate Vermintide from L4D, most notably it's distinct yet flexibly customisable classes and its loot/levelling/crafting systems. And that's without mentioning the wonderfully evil rat-men themselves. Fatshark has gone to town creating your Skaven foes: They hiss threats from the shadows, rise up from the gutters behind you in ambush, madly rush you in massive numbers or cower in fear when alone. To say that the Skaven are the real stars of this game would not be an overstatement.  But while Vermintide improves on L4D in many ways, in others it still lags behind: the devs have gone to great efforts in crafting memorable characters and locations, but have completely failed to present a unified story like the one in L4D 2. You're supposed to be part of the 'resistance' against the Skaven occupation, but in reality the game doesn't tell any story about this resistance outside of the isolated action snapshots of the missions, with the final encounter being particularly anti-climactic. In addition, the game suffers from some horrifically long loading screens and the occasional frustrating server issue. That said, this is an otherwise excellent experience, with much to like. Certainly worth your time and money. ",

There just needs to be a little bit more of the AI path fix, and they need to use healing potions/medkits more effectively. Mainly medkits. I don't know if they Patched it yet. But an A.I. Registered that a medkit was a potion. So the bot spammed to heal instead of holding it. Eventually the bot healed. But it was almost dead by the time. Main things need a fix are just simply the A.I pathing, and item usage.",

Consider this game to be borderline unplayable without friends, because the bots are that bad right now. :\\ They will not use healing items, on themselves nor on you, except seemingly at random. They cannot pick up optional bonus items (tomes/etc.), and, worst of all.. On the first map you'll hit a few spots with armored rats.. which will destroy all three of your bots without difficulty every time. You have to utterly babysit that part or be ruined.. and unless you finish a level you can't get loot, soo... The bots need serious work.  The 'yes' or 'no' ness of this game is gonna depend on your preference.  The game hinges, quite heavily, on the multiplayer appeal. On your own I imagine it could still be fun, but you'll be at the mercy of hit-or-miss bots. Sometimes they pop over just in time to save you, other times they're playing leap frog over barrel as you die. Not too unusual for bots!  The game itself, unfortunately, may be a lot more 'shallow' than one would expect. Given the Warhammer Universe and all that there is to draw from I presumed, wrongly, that each character would have a bit more 'depth' to them. This may or may not be a deal breaker for you. The only difference in characters is the weapons they can use, and some are pretty similar. There's no progression in terms of skills, passives, or other abilities in any way, shape, or form. I was expecting at least something Borderlands-esque if not more, again just from how varied and broad the Warhammer universe is! There's plenty of items, passives, racial/army traits, and other lore that could be drawn from to give some neat flavor to the characters, rather than just 'this guy uses two swords/daggers/one sword, that guy uses a sword and shield, bigger sword, big mace' and that's really it. I was honestly very disheartened at first by that aspect and felt they had so much room to do so much more with this aspect of the characters.   Also, you only get one of each character in each map, so if you like X character and your friend likes X character.. too bad.  That said, you do start to get items with various passives, though it's entirely pure luck and optional challenge-type mission-based goals to get it, so you may just kinda get the short-end on that. Loot is tough to come by and you may just kinda be stuck 'farming' the first level or so with frustratingly awful bots. It's up to you if items with passives are interesting enough to warrant serious playtime.  With that said, the levels also seem to be static - this is maybe my second biggest complaint. I had thought maybe the goals would move around, but they do not seem to, at least not on the first few levels. This means that veteran players will have a distinct advantage and, unfortunately, any new player is going to be a weight on the team. The longer you stand aroudn the more rats come your way, they seem to spawn endlessly, so exploring or being lost is punished quite a bit.  I also have to complain a tad about the lighting - it's WAY too contrast heavy! You can go from seeing brightly illuminated clouds in the sky in front of a moon that looks like a sun, then turn and not be able to make out the textures on a barrel because it's slightly in the shadow of a building. There's not nearly enough ambiant light and the lighting feels super stark as a result.  BUT with all that said, the combat is fairly satisfying. It's a bit confusing at times - some creatures you'll drop 20 arrows in and they won't flinch, other times you'll do 5 and they'll drop without seemingly any headshots, so it's a bit hard to really read what is going on.  The melee is what really shines, though that does have a bit of quirkiness. The graphics are solid, save the lighting nuance that bugs me, and that may just be a personal thing to be fair.  I wish the levels were a bit less linear so that it required some 'figuring out' each time, but you'll get down an ideal path pretty quick, know exactly where all the bonuses are, and that sorta farts on the replayability in terms of being interesting. But, again, the combat itself is fairly satisfying.   So, if you think $30 is a good price for some reasonably satisfying first person smashing, and aren't too sour at being stuck in YET ANOTHER Warhammer game as playing nothing but the lame races, and you can deal with the relative lack of super interesting progression, then it probably is the game for you. If you have a few friends who are in the same boat, it makes it a lot better as with any sort of game of this nature. The multiplayer makes it plenty more interesting as usual.  Another note, though, you CANNOT trade. If you get a super cool item your friend would love to have.. too bad. :( Also, keep in mind this game is SERVER BASED. There appears to be NO Offline mode whatsoever. No LAN. So if the servers go up in flames or the company bails out in a year or two, you're stuck with yet another abandoned unplayable game that has no support. So.. that may be a buyer beware for some people. It's becoming more a trend in recent years and it's frightful how easy we can all be left holding the bag.  It's kinda annoying when I just wanna hop on alone and mess around by mself but can't due to some server nonsense.",

The combat system in the game is surprisingly good for a horde type game. The sword play is really good every hit you deliver onto a rat is satisfying (especially cutting there heads off) the game modes are all objective so far, but what makes the play style unique everytime is like Left 4 Dead's random spawning where it spawns random rats instead of say a Orgre Rat at one place every playthrough its just random. One of my favorite things is the loot system as of now you don't find loot in game but after the game if you are successful you gain dice you can roll some dice are rarer than others and have a higher chance of getting a better rarer item. The classes are really fun there is not one I can't play there are 5 of them. I also love the forge you can unlock special abilities for your weapons via the forge.

Even with it still getting worked on, it came out for only 30$ (40$ for special). First DLC is also free so thats a bonus. PAy DLC is also on its way but its easier to invest in a game when it comes out cheap.  I think big developers need to follow these guys example.",

It is not perfect but it is the most compelling game I have played in a very long time. I look forward to more content/DLC for this title.",

I guess the repetitiveness is kinda-sorta tied to this genre. However, I totally feel like the crafting and therefore character customization act as a hard counter to that 'problem'.  For example, I wasn't able to enjoy L4D 1 and/or 2 even closely as much as I do Vermintide, simply because of the lacking sense of progression. Vermintide gives you something to progress with: Loot, EXP, customization --&gt; addiction.  The gameplay is impressively fluid and responsive, the hitboxes are from time to time a bit off, but mostly feel just right and reward every hit/shot with a proper, gory and satisfying animation.  The sheer amount of potential for this title is amazing, even though i highly doubt, that most of my desires won't ever come true. Some exaples, which i persoanlly think would benefit the game greatly:  - An experience based Skillsystem for each of the Heroes - A deeper Crafting-System / Loot-System - Bossmonsters (Not talking about the specials) - Maybe for the end of each chapter - Perhaps bossfight mechanics which require more than just hitting the thing untill it dies  Bottom Line: Out of all games which roam this genre, i've gotto admit:  Vermitide does it the best way. Clever, modern, addicting. Get it.",

What keeps me playing (and will keep me playing for a while) are clean melee mechanics, interesting objectives during missions, pacing, and focus on teamplay.   The risk vs. reward system implemented in the way you get loot is interesting, and while many people question it, I support it. To get to roll on the loot table, you MUST be victorious in the mission. I think this forces more people to play the game 'properly' for their own benefit. It encourages teamplay. Of course, it does open the doors for trolls, but thus far, I've yet to experience one, and I only play pubs.  Also, you can pick up items to boost the number of dice you get to roll on the loot table. These items take up useful slots, like your engineer slot for Grimiores, or your Health potion slot for Tomes. (both of which reward extra dice). This adds an extra risk vs reward scenario that each player must consider during the course of the game (usually).  I find myself balancing melee with ranged as all of the characters. This is interesting because in most games, you tend to focus more on one or the other.   The loot is upgradable, none of it is really overpowered... they found a way to balance things just right, it seems.   Great game. I definitely recommend picking it up. It's worth full price, and definitely worth sale prices. Enjoy!",

I have been able to get alot of the people who use to be big on l4d1 and l4d2 into a game which has good replay value and the same underlying concept of utilizing team work to get a know acomplishment. I would give this an 8 out of 10. Due to a few things needing to be polished, or lack what I would consider a great game.  Positive: There are many maps around (15 I think) which you can play, which is a lot more than the orginal 5 maps l4d orginally offered. There is a wide variaty of styles and combat choices that each individual player can play. There are 5 various levels of game play averaging from easy to nightmare mode. There is an upgrade system for weapons. There is a good variaty of enemys to play against espically against you storm vermin....... It also offers another higher risk vs reward where you can collect tombs (which take hp spots) to grimoires which lowers your overall teams hp to get better dice rolls for weapons and other trinkets. This game constantly keeps the player on the move, unlike in l4d where there were slow parts with no zombies or very little.  Negatives: There are still many bugs and glitchs espcially for special vermin. The pack master and vermin runner (hunter) are by far the most glitchy. From teleporting across openings, to having bad hit boxes, to not having shoving not affect them or your fellow ally. There is a drop system and basically to get good drops you as a player will have to grind on specific levels getting grimoires and tombs for the ones that do have them. This will also encourge people to utilitze glitches to get past harder parts of those levels which offer grimoires in the game. The levels that dont offer this, well there is not much reward in itself other than beating a level to get the final experience and open more levels (you can still get a chance of getting a drop, its just must lower without tombs and grimoires). The drop system is also very noticable in weapon damage, for example one of the characters I like to play I only have grey items (lowest level) it takes about 2-3 hits to kill (not a headshot) 1 average rat. Yet when I play with others who have golden level items they will kill the same enemy in 1 hit (not including head shots). Enemys seem to spawn ontop of players more than one occasion and sadly that can be a pack of storm vermin which insta kill you or even a rat ogre.... yes I have had both spawn ontop of me.....it ended badly.  Final: Overall this game is very fun despite the very apparent glitches and screwed up special vermin. If some of the items listed in the negatives area be improved I think the game will do very well. Espeically not having tombs, or grimoires on all levels. As long as FatSHark provides good support and timely fixes i think this game will be high up on those who enjoyed l4d's list (I just hope Fatshark doesnt make the same mistake that TRS did with evolve). This game provides alot of potentinal just as evolve did on intial release, but because of the lack of support of inherent glitches, and imbalances in the game is one of the main reasons why most later on gamers who stuck to higher levels of playing shyed away from the game.",

The game is very short. You could beat it in one day very easily. 12 maps total. None take more than 30 min to complete. Game is glitchy. Devs did not take the time to test it correctly. Game will crash on startup, in the middle of maps, and rats will hit you through walls. All things I would only expect in beta. I have 30 hours logged right now and that means I basically got a little more than 1 dollar per hour. Loot system is really... well bunk. You struggle your nuts off to get to the end of a map on higher difficulty and after you finally win you get an item for completing the level. But wait... the items are on a totem pole that allows you to get one notch up per die roll. 6 sided dice and one spot for loot. The odds are terrible that you will get a good item. Most likely you will get another paper weight sword or axe that you already have 10 of. I have to admit I don't understand how so many people could recommend this game in its current state. I am starting to lose faith in reviews on steam. Without an empowering loot system the replay value after completing the game is really... well non existent.  P.S. The bots are useless so if you can't find a game with human players you are screwed.",

A lot of them don't use their mic or even text chat, but they still play well and help you when you're down.  It feels like Left 4 Dead mixed with a bit of Chivalry. There's a large focus on melee, though there are pistols, rifles, crossbows, etc. for when you need to kill someone from a distance.  The game is very fleshed out, with a loot system (roll dice after finishing a mission, you get more dice to roll by completing higher difficulties, collecting hidden tomes and grimoire in the missions, etc.) and a forging system. You can combine 5 items of the same rarity level to create a new item. It's very addicting!  There's an Inn that you can hang out at between missions if you want to. You can look at your inventory here, mess with the forging system, vote on the next mission, and test out your weapons.  There's five classes to play as. Witch Hunter, Bright Wizard, Dwarf Ranger, Empire Soldier, and the Waywatcher. They all feel very different from one another and a cool touch is that they all have voices and will respond to one another during missions.  I'd highly recommend this game, it's a fantastic co-op game with a lot of depth. There may only be 11 missions, but each one has a bit of randomization to it and feels fresh each time you play through it.",

            "review_text": "Update: Since writing this review, I am pleased to say that Fatshark have done outstanding work on the networking and stability issues I highlighted. The game is now incredibly stable, and I've had no issues at all since launch. In spite of my skepticism that a week's beta time would be enough to smooth out these problems, Fatshark have actually done it. Kudos to them, and two thumbs up for an excellent game. Whole-heartedly recommended.  My original review follows below.  -----  The game itself is fantastic; an updated Left 4 Dead with some fun new mechanics, that makes superb use of the Warhammer IP (if you're a fan and concerned that this is going to be another of the myriad shovelware cash-ins coming out right now, don't be; I haven't seen the Warhammer world depicted so perfectly since Dawn of War). I'm also a big fan of the way it picks up on Left 4 Dead's trick of storytelling without breaking up gameplay, and the banter between the characters is genuinely brilliant, moreso because you'll only ever have 4 of the 5 on a mission, so you get to pick up different conversations each time. The weapon and load out choices add a whole extra layer of replayability, and there's more than enough variety to let each player find something they like. The missions themselves are fun, albeit repetitive, and the game will definitely need a few injections of content to keep it entertaining. On the other hand, the developers seem to be planning lots of extra levels and characters, so I could definitely see myself putting plenty of time into this, and at a $30 price tag it can get away with being a little lighter on content than some other titles.  So why don't I reccomend it? Because the game isn't ready for launch, plain and simple. It's brilliant, and cracking good fun, but the networking issues and frequent crashes (and the fact that a host crashing ends the entire session) make the game barely playable. Fatshark need to get these problems figured out if they want this game to survive its first four weeks, and I seriously doubt that 5 days is enough time for them to do that. Another four weeks in beta would have been ideal.  I'm hoping these issues will get fixed, and if they do I'll glad change my review.",

            "review_text": "I'm absolutely TORN on how I feel about this game. Combat feels workable, the core gameplay loop is great and there's actually a degree of depth in this game. At a glance it appears as a completely blatent knock-off of Left 4 Dead's model, and while it is very much *inspired* by the model to the point of replication the developers added in some new features that make it stand out and seem unique. Despite this there are quite a few issues with how the developers intended to make gameplay 'last longer' utilizing a leveling/EXP system, a loot drop system at the end of each level based on rolling digital dice, and an infuriatingly poorly implimented 'crafting' system that was recently added (just before I began playing).  The good bits: I love the Skaven as an enemy type. They've got visual designs that appear interesting and are just so fun to tangle in a melee with. From the heavily armored Storm Vermin (who can come in patrols that can easily wipe underprepared teams), to the Bombadier Rat who lobs gas bombs at you, to the very sleek design of the Assassin Rat, every rat save for the notible exception of the Rat Ogre (literally a rat version of the Tank from left 4 dead in literally every way) looks absolutely fantastic. Combat feels visceral yet rewarding, with weapons acting somewhat well and a clear tradeoff between vicious attack speed and much-needed armor penetration for dealing with all of the scarier threats in the game. This game has a solid gameplay loop fixed firmly in the model that Left 4 Dead began with, and if you've got a few friends to play this with, it can be absolutely fun.  The not-so good bits: Many problems with this game stem from the absolute lack of innovation on an established, but tired model built in the Left 4 Dead franchise. In addition to that, the gameplay feels a slight degree of unrefinement- especially in the Melee combat (the whole reason you play this over Left 4 Dead, unless you have a thing for molesting rats with various fantasy weapons). Generally speaking I've seen three types of successful Melee Combat- Condemned: Criminal Origins has a standard center-screen attack, a charged swipe attack, and a block. Half Life 2 and most old-style shooters use a standard 'reticle' melee attack which hits exactly where you point the mouse, with laser precision. Dead Island had a location-specific aim and swing mechanic that allowed you to make tricky headshots or hit specific limbs. To Vermintide's discredit, neither of these approaches are used. You've got a 'close enough' center screen attack, a 'probably' charged swing attack, and a block that sort of works sometimes (depending on variables that I've yet to work out the meta on besides Shields being useful and everything else sucking). The melee combat feels like it's inching close to workability but sometimes trying to get headshots on the armored foes that you absolutely need to get headshots on can feel like playing a D20 system.  The UGLY truth: This game is a time-sink which has a reward system built entirely around one simple principle - Loot Grinding. You get EXP to unlock loot, the loot is randomly generated. You complete missions to get loot, the loot is randomly rolled for and generated. You can technically play the very-hard version of the game where you pick up hidden books that take up healing and utility slots of your inventory, just to modify how screwed you are in the RNG loot system. At its very core, Vermintide is a game that has solid gameplay built entirely around this loot system. Loot is tiered, there's even 'tokens' you get from losing missions or breaking down weapons using the in-lobby forge and it's just a mess. It's a game that wants you to play it for hours, but won't let you have the power-creep that any non-grinding person will want to play. I can't tell you readily how many runs of the first mission, The Horn of Magnus, I've played loot-grinds on. I can tell you that mission is hilariously burned into my brain- when more exciting missions should be instead.  Lastly, souring my experience is that the missions are kind of slotted together without any real narrative beyond some breifings and the premise of the game. Additionally, I've yet to find a way to disable the introduction cinematic and have to wait for it to load, skip it, and then load the in game lobby. Oh yes, the lobby loads every time- simultaneously a cool menu and a poor starting room for most players (you explore the menu in first person, essentially). If it had a better narrative, a more rewarding loot system (seriously, of the 14 hours i've played thus far, probably 10 of it has been spent loot grinding for a single decent Mace and Shield combo), and a bit more consistent melee system, I'd recommend it at the full listed MSRP. However, I can only suggest to purchase it on sale for now, until the game gets more fixes and/or some content added. Oh and lets not forget that loot system SERIOUSLY needs refinement.",

But where a lot of clones have tried and failed with a medieval/fantasy style Left4Dead co-op this game is much smoother and better built. You choose between 5 characters in a 4-player level run, wielding different weapons for each character as well as which playstyle you prefer.  The difficulty is higher than most games. Do not feel bad if you have to crank it down to easy to get the hang of it, but each succesful run feels like an accomplishment due to that. Combine that with how the game prioritizes skill over loot grinding and you have a great challenge to look forward to that's never impossible but never easy either.  Now, with the praise out of the way I'll get to the cons. The chance based rolls on items as well as their effects means you can get a very Diablo-esq feeling of loot grinding. After you beat the campaign on easy/normal, most players will tend to replay the first level or a quicker run numerous times. And while the levels differ based on what enemies spawn where, it can get repetitive very quickly. Especially if rolls don't go your way. On top of that, the overall narrative is very intriguing but sparse at best, leaving you with very little to do aside from getting better items to do more runs to get better items, etc etc etc.  All in all, the price is worth it for a single person solely because of the challenge and generally solid fun. Playing with friends however makes the whole experience exponentially better, and I would even go as far as to say don't buy it until you have a friend or friends to run this with. Simply because the game is so much better with good coordination and equally great celebration at the end.",

Edit: I've seen negative reviews lately and really don't get why people say it's cookie cutter left 4 dead. I agree like 90% of the core formula is there but the beauty of it is it FEELS completely different. The hack and slash melee combat is great for the fantasy setting and I think the loot system keeps you interested in playing the game. It's absolutely amazing if you can find 1-3 friends to play with it gets awesome! Although I do miss the days of the glitchy horn of Magnus runs... Ahhh the good old days  Also the game was just updated with a quest system so the RNG of the loot system isn't as rough as there are alternate ways of getting gear.

To get an increased chance at better loot specific item's, Tome's and Grimoire's, with Tome's taking the health item slot and the Grimoire taking up the potion slot and reducing health around 25% per Grimoire. That coupled the game having a game director to make thing's suspiciously easy before throwing a rat ogre at you or sending horde after horde of skaven in a short span of time.

            "review_text": "As mentioned in most reviews, this game is a lot like Left 4 dead which was a favorite game of mine. I love this style of cooperative game play where you are forced to rely on your teammates...or else you die. I was mostly pulled in by my love for Warhammer fantasy though and they definitely got that part right. Graphically the game is great, especially Drachenfels dlc, and there are some awesome looking weapons. So all that said:  The Good:   -Coop that demands teamwork or you fail.   -Nice weapon variety with lots to choose from, even though some are a bit underpowered.   -Lots of variety of levels to play and some are quite large and fun to explore and look amazing.   -This game can be very challenging and outright punishing if you choose it to be. That's a definite pro in my book.   -To expand on previous point, you can collect tomes which take up health slots, and grimoires which reduce whole  party's health. This is added optional challenge which rewards you with better chances at loot rolls.   -A loot system which gives you added incentive to keep playing.   -The combat is fun as hell! I never knew it could be so deeply satisfying to kill Rat men.   -The Rat AI is pretty good and does a great job at keeping the pressure on you at all times. I very much enjoy the rushes that come at random. I also love the randomness of mob spawns. It makes levels have a lot of replayability.   - Very dark and gritty feel to the game which is right up my alley.   -The Soundtrack is bad ♥♥♥ and totally fits Warhammer Fantasy.   The Not so good -   -Loot system has flaws - Namely It's completely RNG and you don't get much for failing a mission. It can be quite demoralizing when you fight tooth and nail for upwards of a half an hour and are rewarded with a few measly green coins ( at level 30, or nothing at all at the lower levels).   - No real reason to run some of the levels. A lot of people just farm the easiest ones over and over and avoid the more difficult maps. Should be an incentive to do all maps.   -Friendly BOT AI is horrendous. They are of little to no help to you.   - Need more variety of mobs. All of the special mobs in the game are great and each do a good job of causing you and your team problems, but I wish there was a few bosses to tackle at the end of some missions or some other races to kill besides rats.   - Some weapons are borderline useless. (Shortbows i'm looking at you). There's a few weapons where there just isnt' any scenario that it would be better to take them over others.  - Game isn't fully optimized yet, graphically. I'm running it on a 1080 and I get some frame dips in parts that really shouldn't be happening. (Overall though it works fine for me)   Overall, I feel like this game is worth playing especially if you can get it on sale. There's a lot to love here despite some things needing work. Yes the loot RNG is frustrating, Yes there's some problems with some of the weapons, and yes there's some glitches that still exist. But if you look past all that, there is a diamond in the rough here. It's a great game to play with friends and to try to beat some of the harder levels and difficulties. I can't count how many celebrations erupted (and frustrations too!) from the intense missions that we were put through in the last week or so that I've been playing. It can be quite exhilarating watching your last teammate come into the wagon at the end of a mission with a massive zerg of angry rats nipping at his heels. It can also be equally thrilling or frustrating when those dice come up big and you get that orange trinket or rare helmet. Bottom line, I personally recommend this game since I'm 70 hours into it and still having as much fun with it as i had on day 1.",

The gametime you will get out of this game is highly dependant on you as a player, as just like Left 4 Dead it has a limited amount of maps so after a while you will be doing re-runs of the maps. However with the new 'Quest' feature it will reward you for doing so.
