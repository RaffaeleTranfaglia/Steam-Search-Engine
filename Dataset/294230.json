Like the classic 'snake', you eat dots that makes you grow and must not eat your tail or body, in puzzle levels that require a little bit of thinking to make it through without leaving a dot being and thus getting full score. There are a few constrains making it original, like one-way paths and ice patches on which you can't change direction, forcing more thinking.  Also, I encounter an issue and the developpers correct it within 2 days, which is really great!",

It obviously gives the appearance of being for children, though I doubt many could solve all the maps. Millie, couldn't grab me for long enough to play through the whole thing. That said, its worth a try, I imagine many people who started playing in the early 90s would find something nostalgic about this little game, and for the price, its worth taking that chance.",

However, unlike Snake, there are various barriers placed around the map, which gives the game a bit more of a challenge. Overall, I enjoy the gameplay and this twist. The art is also really cute, which is a plus for me. The only annoyance that I have is the loud tune that is played when you eat x orbs (100, 200, 300) but I got over it after a while. ^^",
