            "review_text": "You'll definitely like this game if you like choose your own adventure games, or just adventure games in general. Going through the story once hasn't taken me more than 2 hours, but don't let that make you think this game is small-- it's packed with tons of different paths to take in the storyline, with each path revealing a different part of the story. I found myself replaying to piece together the whole picture, favoring some characters over others to get new information out of them. If you find yourself having trouble committing to a long video game, or forgetting where you are in the game, Dyscourse might be a good match for you, as it was for me.  Additionally, the style of the game is beautiful and very quirky, and the colors are a nice balance of saturated and subdued. Very easy to look at for long periods of time if you find yourself playing for hours on end. Music adds a lot to the mood of each scene, and the writing is smart and charming. Pay close attention to what you read! And choose wisely. ;)  Overall: Buy this game. Throw your money at it. Play it forever. ALSO: There's a cute cat with fluffy ears in the game. Do it for the cat.",

            "review_text": "Dyscourse is an adventure game where you have to make a choice for every single decision. You find yourself on an island after a plane crash with some other passengers. It's up to you to figure out how to survive and get rescued while trying to keep everyone alive and happy! The game is interesting in that every decision creates an action and therefore creates a reaction and it's fun to see how that unfolds throughout the game.  There are numerous endings and choices, but the game becomes extremely repetitive in order to see everything because you are not allowed to skip action-scenes or bypass large chunks of dialog so you find yourself sitting there seeing the same dialogue over and over. The game is fun for the first couple playthroughs but after that it becomes very boring (even using the rewind feature by picking the game up from any played day and not from Day 1 again).",

            "review_text": "Dyscourse is a bit unusual as a 'decisions matter' style of adventure game because the unofficial tagline should be 'MAKE ALL THE DECISIONS!!!'.  You awake from a plane wreck on a remote island and quickly come across a group of survivors. You need to choose 'wisely' to help the group survive, but once you complete the game you gain access to a day rewind option which will allow you to attempt pushing the story down different branches   until you are literally pushing other survivors down branches just to see if they will fall and die   because why not? This really is the main point of the game, and it's fun for a while but I got to a point where I was satisfied that I'd seen everything I wanted to see. According to the achievements list I've only seen 41% of all possible story events, but it just seems like it would be punishing to attempt to unlock every minor event. I'd rather put Dyscourse down while I still feel like it was a refreshingly unique game rather than grind my way through every possible arc just so that I can say I saw it all.  6 out of 10, it wasn't a total plane wreck ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)",

            "review_text": "The island is alive. It speaks to you through the actions of others, gauging your response, judging your actions. There is no right decision to make, because there is no decision to make at all. Your actions are predetermined and irrefutable, masked by choices you believe you are making independently but which only serve to dissuade you from discovering the truth of your fatalism. Every attempt to change your fate is little more than a divergence onto a different path leading to the same place, one you will either reach or die trying to find, death being your only truly disruptive action along your path to being rescued. But alas, the island refuses to allow you to die. Your companions may perish but you, you must live. Without you there is no story, no allusions to choice, no reason to continue moving forward. So you must begin again, repeating your path, altering what you can, performing your duty as participant in the islands grand performance. This, is Dyscourse, a tale of island survival and the folly of static choice.  Dyscourse is, structurally, a choose-your-own-adventure book repurposed as a mildly interactive paper-craft narrative experience. You play as Rita, a disillusioned barista now marooned upon a desert island after a fluke plane crash. Joining you are your fellow survivors, each with a personality large enough to support the interpersonal drama at the center of Dyscourse’s narrative. Whether through the ramblings of a paranoid ex-government conspiracy theorist, or the nihilistic reflections of a middle-aged office worker, Dyscourse excels in playing to the eccentric, reality TV nature of its plot, stirring up tragedy and disagreement among its cast so as to better position you, the default mediator, to make “meaningful narrative decisions”.  As a proof of concept, Dyscourse could be considered a success in how it has managed to craft an adventure in which you have some semblance of control over how the story unfolds. Your choices have a clear, dramatic effect on the overall narrative, and altering those decisions in repeated playthroughs can drastically influence the way that particular story unravels. But for all the ways Dyscourse attempts to make you believe that you are in control of, or at least have an active role in its narrative, it inevitably runs up against the same problem inherent to any game in which perceived player choice is privileged above everything else, that being that there can never be any true choice within a fixed environment.  Your actions in Dyscourse are only meaningful insofar as they serve to position you upon a predetermined narrative pipeline, each decision effectively serving to open and close different paths until you arrive on one which is so narrow as to remove the possibility of choice altogether. You are never truly making a free choice, only deciding where the story goes, and it always has to go somewhere. Decisions in Dyscourse become more and more binary with each new playthrough as the more you understand about how its model of choice works, the more limiting and arbitrary it becomes. Every choice might have ramifications, but those ramifications are always system driven, decisions devolving into immovable numbers with no room to compromise. There will always be only enough to feed two, always only time enough to save three, always a binary choice between who lives and who dies.  One might argue that choose-your-own-adventure books, as a medium onto themselves, were never about choice but only participation. The point wasn’t so much to change the story so much as guide it, as within a finite number of pages there was never any illusion that you, the reader, could actually alter the words upon them. Choose-your-own-adventures then become predominately about seeing the ways the story can change if you follow different paths, how characters shift and plotlines diverge, as if to preemptively answer the “what ifs” of readers and give them a larger understanding of the ways a particular world and the characters within it function in relation to one another.  If we apply this way of thinking to Dyscourse its predetermined nature becomes less inherently frustrating, though no less arbitrary. It isn’t unreasonable for Dyscourse to have limits, but how it defines those boundaries often feels intentionally antagonistic for the sake of propelling the player forward. You are unable, for instance, to ever choose not to take action when presented with a choice. Even after building a SOS signal, you can’t merely wait along the coast to potentially be rescued. You instead much follow where the game points you, only getting a say insofar as you can attempt to control who lives and dies. If Dyscourse is wholly about emergent, player driven narratives, it seems odd that so many of the most important decisions within the game force the player’s hand.  Games like Telltale’s The Walking Dead or Heavy Rain work as choice driven narratives primarily because they are framed first as interactive stories. Complete control isn’t expected, thus when the limits of your decisions become apparent they don’t serve to discount the impact you’ve had on the narrative as a whole. Dyscourse in comparison is wholly about the ways in which you are actively shaping the story’s progression. Its narrative is entirely in service to its mechanics, with it not mattering so much what your decisions lead to only that you were given a choice in the first place. This prioritizing of player over plot causes every outcome to feel weightless and inevitable. With no reason to care about these characters the narrative is little more than a checklist of variables. Action A produces effect B; characters X and Y survive in one run, character Z another.  There is some entertainment to be had in seeing how far you can push Dyscourse’s plot within what little freedom you have to direct it, but the novelty soon wears off when you are given no reason to care what the eventual effect may be. Why should I care if my group is rescued when their survival is merely the predetermined result of each of these actions? Why do I care if I am rescued at all when I have no way to go about doing anything but getting rescued? Dyscourse is a game of choice, but without a compelling reason to find meaning within these binary decisions, I was left with little reason to care about the outcome.

            "review_text": "You wake up on the beach after your plane crashes. You band together with five other survives who make you their impromptu leader. The choices you have to make have some major consequences in this dire fight for survival. Their lives rest in your hands. Do you have aptitude to make the right choices to save everyone?  This game is all about cause and effect. When a boar steals what little food you have do you try to hunt it down or stay put? When the storm threatens your shelter should you make do or wander blindly into the night and hope to find something better? Even choosing who to feed with your limited food supply is a tough choice. Maybe someone is injured and you feel badly and want to feed them. On the other hand, maybe you give the food to a more fit candidate to give them some energy to help you forage. Maybe you just decide based on their attitudes and personalities.  The story and the level of emotional attachment in this game is through the roof. The characters all feel so real. You have Teddy, a super paranoid tech wiz, who thinks this is all one big planned conspiracy. Jolene, a demanding yet surprising optimistic women, who is losing interest in her husband and fellow survivor George. Then theirs Steve and Garret, a depressed office worker and a gaming addict. Rarely have I found it this easy to remember characters names, its just their personalities and so strong and believable you really feel connected to them as time goes by.  The art and sound effects are really unique and fit the game so well. The game has a really pretty, colorful and slightly cartoony, paper-craft look to it. The story can get dark at times and I'm glad its not too realistic looking, I feel that could have made it even more gloomy than it already is. The characters all make funny and super charming voices when the talk. You can read what they say but all you hear is them mumble with their different accents that fit their personalities perfectly.  This game isn't very long, in fact it only takes a little over an hour to complete. Please don't not write it off just for that, for what plays in an hour feels like days as you immerse your self in this game. Not to mention there are so many different paths to take the replay value is very high. Watching my sister play and make different choices vastly changed the direction of the game and let me see lots of things I didn't in my play-though. If you enjoy the TellTale games like the Walking Dead or the difficult choices likes those in the Mass Effect series I believe you'll really enjoy this game. So tell me, are you ready to step up and make the though choices?",

There isn't really an epic story other than trying to survive and knowing other characters, and each playthrough would be pretty short, but you'd want to see what other choices or what assigning other people to other tasks would do.   The game has good stylistic graphic and production value, and isn't actually that expensive, so might worth it to some people, but I got this in a bundle, and eventhough I'm happy with it, I don't think I'd buy it in full value.",

I strongly recommend this game for all people who gets the ability of english.  Here are some great elements of Dyscourse.  1. It's an art. I mean everything in this game is beautiful, for me. It's art design is pretty awesome.  2. It's stroy is great. Although the story is a little bit cliche, it still is attractive. The point is about making your own story, not the story writed by others. You would never know what would happen if you make different choices.   And, of course, it got something not great. It's price is higher than what it is supposed to be, in my view.  Anyway, it still is good game. If you already have spent thousands of time on fighting with others through internet and wanna get yourself relax, this game is a good choice.",

            "review_text": "WARNING: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!  Thanks to the develepers (Owlchemy labs) I can play this game and I was baffled on how anyone could have negative veiws on this work of art. The story might be Cliche But its 'Good Cliche' if that makes any sense. Most people also complain about charecter development and can Kinda agree because i have had multiple moments where My party just fight each other but thats predictable with the diversity of each and every person all having their own 'Life' I suppose you can say.  The Pros! - To be honest this game has a lot of areas it perfected and i cannot explain them all so here are some i guess.  The gameplay is smooth at 60fps on my 1.3Ghz LAPTOP! Thats rediculous and how it does that is beyond my knowlege. The second thing i love abut this game is the killer soundtrack, I dont have the delux edition and no i dont have the album but i have listened to all the songs on youtube and they where amazing and defenately made the moment in most dramatic scenes. I also love the charecter development in the game and how polished and perfected it is! Honestly I felt attached to most of them (Except the crazy one) And there is only 8 days. But my favourite thing about this game is the art style. Holy Sh*t does this game look amazing! The 'Paper' Style of the whole game is Breath-taking, and the shadows, Oh the shadows they are perfect make my babies.  The Cons - It was hard but here they are!  The game is f*cking short as sh*it! It took me about 1 and a half hours to complete this game with two different endings, although i can excuse them for how good it is it still could have been another hour longer at best by adding another week. The charecters die just because of the plot which i found unlikable and i wish they would have lived longer and stayed on the island or something I dont know. I also dont like that even though its free the dlc 'Indie island' Is EVEN SHORTER! I counted about half an hour! Thats faster than a bullet train! It is although free so i cant hate or whatever. :/   In Conclusion! - No spoilers here I promise  Would i recommend this game? Yes i would, If it was cheeper. and thats all to say. Thanks for reading!",
