            "review_text": "Let's split this up: First, the game itself. It's a strategy RPG with a wild, sometimes self-referential plot, several jokes, references to movies and TV shows, led by a lovable cast of characters. Gameplay wise, the game's main feature is the possibility to take the characters all the way to level 9999(yes, four nines in a row), several over the top attacks, combo possibilities, and the geo-panel system, all adding to a highly replayable game. Combined with the 'Item World', where you can go through randomized stages to strenghen your gear and even acquire some of the strongest in the game, and with the several endings and new game +, this will keep fans of JRPGs entertained for hundreds of hours. I had over 250 of those back in the PS2. Highly recommended.  Granted, some mechanics are rather dated, but there's nothing obnoxious enough to disturb the enjoyment of the game.  Now, the port. Look, it's a 13 year old game. The original was on the PS2, and this version is based on the PSP port. Personally, I expected the game to be a straight port and locked to 30fps, and I would have been fine with that for this game, but they added new surface textures, a new interface, and high quality character portraits. The character sprites themselves have not been touched, and offer the same pixelized style from back in the day, witth an optional 'filter' that basically blurs the images(meh). Otherwise, the game has no real resolution options, but seems to run at your desktop resolution when in fullscrenn, and has a 'Depth of Field' and 'Background Blur', which to me, end up just bluring the top and the bottom of screen, and an option for SSAO, which at the very least makes the game jitery.  Upon release, there were random performance issues, but the first patch seems to have fixed most of those. Avoid the needless SSAO option and it should run fine. I barely scratched the surface of what the game offers with this review, and can't recommend this game enough.",

            "review_text": "OH BOY WHERE TO BEGIN!  Disgaea is my favourite game series of all time and after waiting literally 3 years later it finally made its debut to steam! Although it had a rocky start on launch day NIS did a good attempt to fix all the problems and although the game is playable for the most part, the rest of the problems can be fixed with the  Prinny Perfect Mod  that Kaldaien made so I strongly suggest using it if you want a better experience. Port issues aside, let's discuss about the meat that is Disgaea!  The best way to describe Disgaea is that it's Final Fantasy Tactic's crazy uncle who overdosed on drugs and alchohol. Compared to other tatic's games such as the aforementioned Final Fantasy Tatics, Fire Emblem and X-Com, Disgaea gives you so much freedom and allows you to be as creative as you want to be! Literally every humanoid class can use any weapon skill with any strategy that opens up to many possible combinations (e.g. mage's with guns and archers with axes) and the absurd level cap of 9999. On top of that, the Item World, although archaic in the first game, is an excellent random dungeon if you want to spend time spelunking and improving your items!  Now if you don't like grinding in videogames or can't tolerate an excess amount of grinding, I strongly suggest staying away from this game series as it is heavily grind based later on in the post-game/side-game, where the real meat of the game takes place.  Out of all the entries in Disgaea, the main story in the first game is probably the best imho. With the original trio Laharl, Etna and Flonne, they make the story really enjoyable as it's mostly comedic and self-aware of it's own absurdness. Granted it does an excellent job when being serious as well so don't jump in thinking its all fun and games!  Voice acting wise it can be a hit or miss for many people. I personally enjoyed the english dub of this game as they did a pretty good job in voicing the characters and I expecially love Barbra Goodson, Michelle Ruff and Sandy Fox for their roles as Laharl, Etna and Flonne respectively. They pretty much made the game for me and even to this day they still reprise their roles for the characters. And ik that Etna's original voice actor from the PS2 version didn't carry over and although I did like her old voice, I prefer Michelle Ruff voicing Etna since I'm more used to her voice than Amanda Winn Lee's. If you don't like hearing the dub there's the option to switch to japanese sub so it's up to personal preference.  Btw, 90% of all the non-port problems that are in the first game have been fixed and improved on in Disgaea 2 and onward! This includes monster unit equality, faster level grinding and more challenging ordeals :) With that being said, I recommend playing Disgaea PC as it not only does a great job introducing you to the game's mechanics but also shows how the series has come far 13 years later.  Edit 04/21/16: Completely forgot to talk about the music in Disgaea. Simply put, its GOD LIKE and I want everyone and anyone to listen to it. I give it a sardine/10 its too good m8.  Edit 08/22/16: Now Pleinair, Adell, Rozalin and Overlord Zetta can be recruited and playable! I waited nearly 6 months for Pleinair to be playable and NIS has delivered :)",

Disgaea is not your mere SRPG when you go through the story and just simply finish it. Here you can grind everything, which i mean as in  everything . The item world offers limitless opportunity to explore your limit to the highest level   even though sometimes the RNG god just wanna play with you and send some enemies to a separate island unreachable without the Hyperdrive  .   Pros : 1. After the latest patch, the game runs perfect on my potato. seems they have fixed the memory leak issue. 2. Now i can do item world with no fear of sudden crash (i have completed a hyperdrive run /100 floors but under the beta release) 3. Yeah, you could turn off the effects for both friendly and enemy  (just imagine the time wasted seeing those summon animations in other srpg games)  used when using special attacks, it really helps with grinding.    Cons : 1. No    Plenair   yet. tho you can get her and several other characters with Netherworld Content Pack by Khrisan Thyme in the discussion   P.S. The soundtrack album is released today (March 23/24) and it is great dood!!! - Red Moon FTW   Gonna update this one regularly, but hell, this is Disgaea and surely you guys gonna put a long time playing it.    Happy grinding, dood!!! ",

Fullscreen and SSAO enabled were the only conditions under which I could create lag. (And yes, I play with a PS3 controller.)  If you're expecting all of the new bells and whistles to wow you, you will be disappointed. However, if you just want the original PS2 or PSP experience, this is a viable cheaper option with only minor graphical glitches as of release day.",

The gameplay may seem very simple at first but as more things are added (like geo panels and symbols) the gameplay gets a lot of extra depth to it. I was using the mouse controls and they seemed to work well so having a controller is not necessary.  Although the illustrations of the characters that appear during most cutscenes look very good the sprites themselves do not seem to have been updated at all from the PS2/PSP versions of the game which is a bit disappointing.  For me, this game run very smoothly and I am getting at least 50fps during all areas of the game and I have a pretty bad laptop for gaming (It can't even run Skyrim at 30fps).  However a few people have been complaining about how the game is running for them so until the source of these people's problems have been fixed it might be safer to hold off on buying this game.",

            "review_text": "TL;DWTR - A tactics RPG with ridiculous stat capping, humorous/goofy dialogue, and enough grind to last hundreds of hours. Recommended. ------------------------ As always, my recommendation comes with a disclaimer that your experiences will vary. Please read through at least the next paragraph.  Let's tackle everyone's main issue with this port... performance. Good God, launch day was a disaster for a lot of players, even those with high-spec PCs. But, interestingly enough, I have a mid-tier rig running 2.5-year-old hardware (i5-4460 3.2GHz + R7 260X 2GB), and Disgaea PC works fine. I'm honestly not sure where everyone's frame drops are coming from. I tested using new/old map textures, SSAO (which I didn't like personally, but it still didn't impact my performance too much), and all the other minor graphical tweaks...no sudden drop in FPS for me. So I'm probably really lucky that it runs perfectly fine... and as such I'm going to ignore factoring in performance for my review. Just be warned that if the game doesn't run smoothly for you, the rest of this review is pointless and you should return this game until NISA (Nippon Ichi Software, America) sorts things out.  NISA seems to be on point and fixing a lot of the issues with the game's performance currently, as Disgaea PC's rating has increased from 67% (Mixed) to 85% (Very Positive) after the first few weeks of bug fixes.   Disgaea PC is a port of Afternoon of Darkness on the PSP, which is an enhanced remake of the original PS2 title, Hour of Darkness. This is the third remake of Hour of Darkness, after Afternoon of Darkness and Disgaea DS for Nintendo DS systems.  Disgaea (the series) is a tactical RPG (grid-based, turn-based, action points, the usual deal) with its key selling point being the ability to grind out your stats and level to absurd highs. The caps for stats and level are insanely high (~20 million for each stat in Disgaea PC and 9999 for level). There's a lot of bonus maps, content, and endings to access that the game acknowledges how many New Game Pluses you've done. I love grindy games, and so I figured Disgaea was right up my alley. Sure enough, I've played and enjoyed the hell out of Hour of Darkness and Cursed Memories. Haven't played 3, 4, D2, or 5 yet since I don't own a PS3/4.  Another highlight of the Disgaea franchise is the Item World, a completely randomized dungeon crawl generated from items you collect in the game. By exploring the Item World, you can grab more items, grind out EXP, and improve that item's stats. Each item contains an expansive dungeon of 30, 60, or 100 floors, depending on the item's rarity.  I'd have to argue a minor problem with the mechanics is just how many different systems they've jammed into this game. There's the tactical combat, which is simple enough to understand... then they introduce Geo Panels and Effects, Lifting and Throwing allies, enemies, and Geo Effects...the Dark Assembly, Pupils, Skill/Stat Inheritance between Master and Pupil, the Item World, Reincarnation (Transmigration in this version), and some mechanics the game doesn't even cover such as Elemental Affinities (Fire, Wind, Ice), Status Effects, and Weapon Masteries. For a newcomer this may seem like a daunting amount of things to learn about... and believe me, it is. However, all of these things don't need to be used...in fact the game even tells you, you can beat the game with 'minimal game knowledge'. The systems are there to provide hardcore players the means to be more efficient in grinding out those stats.  I won't go into nor analyze the story (because I suck at analysis and not spoiling), but I will say it's decent and humorous enough to suffice as an RPG plot. I also will not criticize the graphics because I don't really care for them, but the port made the map and character art look better than the PS2 graphics. There is also an option to change the graphics back to the old PS2 game, for that old nostalgic feel (I guess). EDIT: I completely forgot about the Keyboard+Mouse (the mouse kinda messed the cursor movement up for me, so I turned it off...but you could technically play the game using just the mouse if you wanted to... also mouse click detection is a bit bugged) and Gamepad support (which is a little clunky to detect). That's there as well. I suppose I should also add that the port added custom resolution support. (you can resize the screen to your desire)  Overall, I'd give this game a solid 8/10. Good for RPG fans, grind-fest lovers, and people who just want a lot of content for their buck.  Score Breakdown: Story/Plot/Characters: 9/10 (each character seems unique in their own way, dialogue gave me a couple laughs, story was dramatic at times - but not overly so when it was) Music: 8/10 (pretty good soundtrack, still waiting for my digital dood/pre-order soundtrack bonus) Graphics/Art: 5/10 (has a nice theme to it, but even with the new textures the game looks dated, plus the new character filter thing just blurs the pixels so your characters look like a smudge on the screen... wtf?) Mechanics: 9/10 (lots of cheesing you can do with unit movement, lifting, and AoE attacks, maybe intentional, but overall great mechanics Value: 10/10 (hours and hours and hours and hours of content and grind) Performance: 8/10 (works fine on my rig - stays notably above 60fps most of the time - others not so much... EDIT: I am now getting crashes more often, and I'm not sure why. Maybe the math and numbers are getting too high? Either way, dropping 2 points off performance. It shouldn't be crashing because of memory leaks or integer over/underflow.)  Oh yeah, I should add: Buy it for the Prinnies, dood!",

You can have a lot more than 10 toons in your army, but only 10 can fight at the same time. You can switch to another toon if you want by switching out one of the active one on the map. The fight is all about positioning yourself at the right place and also protecting yourself from the enemy who will try to gang up on one of your toon if you let it. - You can raise your level to 9999+. Yeah thats a loooooot of lvl! - You can eventually do millions in damage. In fact, damage becomes rediculus pretty fast! - You can increase the level and stats of all items including weapons and accessories. Even one-use items that restore your skill points can be increased by doing the maps in the item world. Yes, there are random maps in each item with special npc that you can beat and then transfer to other items to improve their stats even more! This concept is pretty awesome!!! - You can decide to rebirth any of your character into another class! They start back at lvl 1 but keep a lot of their stats and all their skills from the original class. So you could have a mage that becomes a ninja or a fighter with lots of evade or hp. Imagine a lvl 1000 character that restart at lvl 1 with genius rebirth (keep 95% of his original stats). Then he can regain stats from his new class pretty fast!  - You got a dark council of senators (much like USA congress) that you need to bribe and/or subdue so that they vote your way in many ordinances. Even when you bribe them all to your side, they can still vote against you the little rascals! Don't know why it makes me think of house of cards so much!!! - The tactics and the fact you can lift your toons and even the enemies and throw them give a lot of tactical choices on the map like you wouldn't believe. - The game is somewhat a bit steep on the learning curve at first because there is a loooot to discover, but after you get the hang of it, it becomes a lot easier to play, but still keep that somewhat deep tactical strategy level.

While certain systems will suffer from various graphical glitches initially, most of these can be fixed by fiddling with the options (want black lines to go away?

Mouse's input are quite annoying and I kinda wished I was able to just use the keyboards to name my character, instead of clicking/navigating through the screen  The game gets REAL heavy if you turn on SSAO,DoF and the End-Blur, it drops from 60 fps to 30 fps on my PC, and it gets heavier while on map with enemies, since the game gets slower, instead of running at a choppy frame rate.  Otherwise, it's a perfectly nice port of Disgaea's Afternoon of Darkness.

Characters: The cast consists of Laharl, a bratty, but oddly cool demon prince; Etna, his scheming vassal and lastly, Flowne, a loving angel-in-training who they call 'Love Freak'. Like I mentioned before, the cast are parodies of anime and RPG tropes, but they retain enough of their own personality to feel like actual people instead of simply jokes. Even the secondary characters are given variation in both their personalities and design. By that I mean there are no throwaway characters because each one feels so unique and different.   The Story: Campy and purposefully silly, Disgaea’s story is rife with comedy and references, but not so much as to ruin the atmosphere. The serious moments are kept appropriately dramatic, but there are times when something goofy happens that can break the tension. These times; however, are kept out of the more serious moments.   Mechanics:  Despite its age the game’s system is still fun and its various features like “The Item World”, “The Dark Assembly” greatly spice up the game. What would be an otherwise tedious grind is saved by conveniences and distractions offered by your ability to bribe or crush the assembly, or grab some stuff in the Item World.",

The graphics of this game have had a reasonable facelift, except for the sprites, which is a shame. Considering a very large portion of these characters and classes have been featured in the most recent games in this series, I can't imagine it would have been a lot of work to add these to this game, considering they've managed to improve most other graphical elements. I'm sure it won't be long until some modders fix that, but it would have been nice to see this done officially.  The UI is still in essence the same UI as on PS2. There is mouse support added, but it is not as streamlined and intuitive as in a UI designed with mice in mind. Playing with a mouse isn't extremely annoying, but I think almost anyone would prefer to play the game with the same input device as it was initially designed for, a gamepad.  The inclusion of both english and japanese is nice for players in Europe, seeing as the original PS2 PAL release did not include the japanese dub.   The extra graphical options surpass what I from experience would have expected from a port of a JRPG as old as this, but a resolution and antialiasing setting would have been nice. Most new graphical effects worked fine on my PC, without slowdowns, but some of them interact with the sprites in an undesirable way in a few situations. Nothing game-breaking, however  Some people have encountered performance issues with this game, even with hardware far surpassing the recommended specifications, but I had no issues. I'd recommend buying the game, and simply apply for a refund if you run into problems.",

Still highly recommended!  There is so much content in this game if you choose to fight the optional side bosses, get the best sword, etc., that it is a steal at this price.  My original Disgaea: Hour of Darkness file had hundreds of hours played on it. I beat the game around 30-40 hours or so (or whatever it was) which was a good game length and enjoyed the story. It also has multiple endings to support multiple playthroughs, which I did some of. I then spent the next 300 hours of playtime fighting the semi-secret alternate bosses, leveling characters up near max level, and acquiring the top end weapons and armor, then leveling them to max level as well.  This is absolutely a great game and worth the price. Yes, there are some minor issues on this port, but the game is still well worth the price and highly recommended!",

Disgaea PC is extremely smooth running for a port of an older game. The controls, when you can get them to work properly, are smooth and well responding.

Seriously, seriously terrible. I was so excited to see this game had a PC release, as my PS2 is unreliable at best at loading games as it gets on in years. I've tried both controller and keyboard &amp; mouse - both were so terrible, that I'm considering getting a refund.

Disgaea PC, unfortunately, is a bad version of the game. It crashes every twenty minutes, sometimes the voice acting disappears, and it suffers from screen tearing at the larger resolution of a full-screen mode. The buttons for controller keybinding are labeled with numbers instead of letters, and while there's an option for Japanese voice-acting, choosing it means you get no voice acting.  Honestly, I've enjoyed what I could play of the game. Despite frequent crashes and forced restarts, I've cleared the tutorial, created a new minion (a cleric), and enjoyed myself immensely. So I'm torn between returning it because the crashes make it nearly unplayable, and keeping it because what little I can play has been deeply enjoyable.  So I'm not recommending this game, but if the game gets a new patch (the developers are still working at it) that fixes the crashing, that will change in a heartbeat.",

Serviceable at best.  The art is nice, the music surprisingly good and the plot quite entertaining. Humour is always YMMV, but I liked it. It definitely helps to have at least a basic appreciation for the Japanese TV references. The core gameplay, however, was disappointing. It is a decent Tactical RPG, a genre barely represented on PC, but compared to its peers there are some serious issues. The way experience is handled cripples certain classes and emphasises one or two over-powered Rambo characters over a balanced and tactial squad (the normal for the genre). This makes a lot of the potential gameplay elements irrelevant, because attempting to explore them weakens you and makes the game more grindy/less fun. The randomised Item World maps are an interesting concept, but can occationally be impossible to complete, resulting in wasted time.  There is a market for this game, but I think it is a very small one. Combined with the not-so-good port, I believe this is a game most people could safely pass over.",
