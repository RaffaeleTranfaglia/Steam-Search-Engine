    "description": "Clan of Champions is a game that you can play with or against friends online. Each match will last around ten minutes. Of course, you can play this game by yourself, but you can ask for your friends' help with difficult missions, or fight against them as part of your training. Their goal is simple: to become the champion.",

            "review_text": "This gamne is basicly a Action RPG/Loot game. The story sucks(what story) but the gameplay is very in the vein of aquire games, Deep rewarding and very indepth. You go level to level beating up enemies, collecting loot, spending points on moves and skills and reapeat. This game will almost never go on sale, I got it for 9.99 and I'm not even sure I could reccomend it at its base price of 40$. Without a doubt though this is probaly one of the best gladiator games on steam. (Kinda mad because my favorite styles Pirates, gladiators and cyberpunk games dont get the depth and open ended games they need.)",
