            "review_text": "At first, the game looks like your regular TD, with towers and upgrades and such, but as you progress through the game, you realize that there is alot of ♥♥♥♥ you need to research that you didn't, which can create some pretty hectic battles. There are a few rules that are always constant, but there are major gamechangers as you move from planet to planet. If a map is too hard on campaign mode, you can generate a different map in less than a second. The game promises an intense, blitzkrieg set of battles that will keep you sweating, and many different ways of dispatching the hordes of titans. Like manually zapping you enemies? buy capacitors. Want your buildings to do the work? Buy defenses. Feel like taking the fight to them? Droid and tank factories. In short: Unique gameplay Brutaly fast and decisive combat Varying degrees of difficulty. 666/10",

            "review_text": "A questionable game. The core gameplay is your usual tower defense: place shooty towers to shoot the monsters, place buffy towers to buff the shooty towers, place special towers to do other things like acquire more money. This part is fairly solid.  I can't stand the wrapper, though. To start with, upgrades have misleading mouseover descriptions. The game is played on a small map where monsters appear from the fuzzy dark edge and quickly approach your base. With this in mind, you might think that researching the Scanner (description: 'Long range detection systems using radar and lidar imaging to improve early alien detection') would extend the map a bit, giving you more space in which to place towers and shoot monsters. But no, the Scanner is actually a buffy tower that increases the firing range of the tower it's placed next to! No 'detection' is involved.  In addition to this misinformation, the campaign mode is very unfriendly to going back and trying to improve your score. Suppose that you've advanced to (for example) level 6 of the campaign, and you're not happy with your performance, so you decide to go back and replay level 3 to accumulate more points there. The extra points from a better completion of level 3 are not granted to your global resource pool on the campaign map, but to your next play of level 4. Thus, you'll have to replay level 4 and level 5 as well in order to get the new advantages transferred to level 6. In general, you won't be playing with your best results - you'll be playing with your most recent results, which makes it frustrating to attempt to improve your record.  The 'Distortion FX' setting that is on by default and jostles your screen at irregular intervals, and the typos in technology descriptions, are just icing on the cake. Perhaps these things are meant to appeal to some sort of misguided realism, but when I'm blowing up alien titans with nanotechnology weapons, I don't want the absurd realism of having low-quality flickering displays because the war caused a power shortage and my character couldn't get spare parts delivered. I want an interface that lets me focus on the gameplay, and the lack of such an interface is the worst fault that I found with Revenge of the Titans.",

I find Defense Grid a more enjoyable title overall, perhaps simply because I feel I better understand it and feel like I can grasp the winning strategies involved.   Revenge of the Titans can be frantic at times, but that's why it's a little bit special. Perhaps part of it is accepting that you will lose towers.  Revenge of the Titans is a worthwhile title if you can pick it up on special, but far from essential. A light recommendation.",

First, one of the only points of contention I have with this game is the price-point (which can be said about the bulk of Puppygame games). That being said, this title is actually worth the $10 they're asking.   Cross-platform tower defense is always nice to have in the library. Low system requirements means that the game could potentially be played on an older netbook (depending on model, of course). Fun, with a decent replay value, this game stacks up with some of the heftier titles in the genre with a unique graphical style and play that makes it perfect to add to any library.",

            "review_text": "Tower defense games seem to come in two sorts these days: those where stages are played like an RTS from an overhead view and those where you get down into the trenches FPS-style. Revenge of the titans is by far my favorite game in the former category. This is because the range of options it provides, and the incentives it offers to explore them, make it much more centered on creative design than anything else in the genre I've yet played.  Titans works essentially like every other tower defense game: set up defenses around something, a wave of baddies swoops in to destroy that something, you must manage your defenses in real time until the stage is complete. But Revenge also has some features which differentiate it. The pixel-art graphics are charming, though they can be a bit confusing in the thick of battle. If you've played anything else by Puppy Games you'll know what I mean as this style is their trademark. Personally, I think it another great strength of the game, though it may not be everyone’s cup of tea.  The stages are very large and very open. The defenses you construct are not bound by a grid, and will likely consist of many, many components rather than just a handful of parts. The size also adds to the challenge: enemies enter the map from many different points in a single stage and are can be difficult to coral.   All this gives you a considerable amount of freedom in coming up with a defensive plan. Many towers interact, so you will be designing and placing installations with scores of interrelated parts, not just putting up some towers on established paths.   Complementing that freedom is a component of management and upgrading. There are two aspects to this: first, there is a deep upgrade tree which, over time, grants you access to new and better towers. This provides a variety of weapons and defenses, but also forces the player to choose which to ultimately prioritize meaning that by game's end you can have very different sets of advanced tools at your disposal. Second, the resources you use to build must be procured during stages via mining, and your balance caries over from level to level. (Thus, in typical PuppyGames fashion, how you play in one stage carries over into subsequent stages.) The fact that your starting resources for the next stage are what remains from the last makes the game into a campaign, and provides an added incentive to devise elegant defense solutions which conserve resources.   Both of these features can mean that it’s possible to get into a situation where a stage simply isn’t feasible due to your prior decisions and mistakes. Conveniently, you can return to any prior stage at any time and play forward again, so your decisions are only as set-in-stone as you want them to be. I found that this actually created replayability, as I went back to try and conduct a better campaign. On the other hand, there were a few points where I found I needed technologies in ways I couldn’t anticipate and had to backtrack to get them.  To sum up, Revenge of the Titans is a tower defense game that gives you space to invent and a reason to do it. If you like the traditional tower defense genre and also enjoy the sort of creative design typical to good sim games there are hours of fun for you in Revenge of the Titans.",

However, my time with it mostly consisted of boredom. I'm rubbish at games like this, and because of that I don't ever play them on any difficulty beyond easy. This could definitely be to blame for the boredom, but when I start struggling at higher difficulties in tower defense games I tend to quickly just lose interest and stop having fun.

            "review_text": "Revenge of the Titans is a 2D tower defense game with RTS elements developed by London-based studio Puppy Games. As in all tower defense games, your goal is to halt the oncoming horde of enemies by strategically placing defensive towers that destroy them. In this case, humanity is being attacked by aliens coming from Saturn’s largest moon Titan.  The campaign spans 50 missions across 5 locations (Earth, The Moon, Mars, Saturn and Titan). After you’re done with the 10-hour campaign, you can spend more time with the game in the Endless, Survival and Sandbox modes. There’s a good amount of content here. If you’ve played a classic tower defense game, Revenge of the Titans will feel pretty familiar. However, what separates this game from the usual suspects are the subtle yet profound base building and resource gathering elements found in traditional RTS games.  Every map starts with just your base which you have to protect from the Titans. Then you have to build factories that mine crystals in order to make money to be able to purchase other buildings and towers. You also have additional buildings at your disposal such as shield generators, cloaking devices, reloaders, etc. All of these can be unlocked over time in the research screen before every mission. After completing each mission you are awarded with a single research point. Apart from buildings and towers, you can research technological advancements which bring their own benefits to the table. The great thing about the research system is that you can re-spec the entire system before each mission. This enables you to try out different tactics and you will need certain towers and abilities when facing a particular enemy.  Enemies come in a pretty large variety of shapes and sizes and certain missions also throw huge bosses at you which can be very challenging. Certain towers are good for certain enemies, that’s where the research screen comes into play. You need to pay attention as to what types of enemies are coming so that you can choose the appropriate towers and technologies otherwise you’ll have a pretty hard time finishing a mission.  The game will also randomly distribute power ups and cash bonuses during missions which you will need to manually pick up on the map within a limited time frame. There’s also a tower that needs to be used against a certain enemy that you have to manually control. Coupled with the base/add-on/tower building, the situation can get pretty hectic at times and certain elements such as the power up pick ups simply come off as an artificial way to increase the action. It impeded on the strategic element and just feels needlessly overbearing.  That said, Revenge of the Titans nails the addictive and tactical core that makes tower defense games so satisfying. And with the RTS twist, it manages to differentiate itself which is really important as the genre is becoming increasingly crowded. It’s a good title for newcomers and veterans alike.  7 OUT OF 10 (GOOD)",

It's hard to pinpoint why, but somehow the game fails to drag me in. There is no controlled progression. Why this might be cool for advanced players, it isn't for new players. After the first couple of missions there is no help from the game. It seems that you can completely mess up the research tree since there are so few pointers of what to do. The levels feel very random. Aliens come from all kinds of directions and typically follow the road, but now and then they don't and it is impossible to plan for this unless you know that. So gameplay boils down to a lot of trial and error, which doesn't work for me in most games. I prefer tower defense games where I get a new level and then try to figure out a solution from the knowledge gained in previous levels. This is impossible here. There doesn't seem to be any information of how the waves look like. Special enemies are not introduced well. And on the battlefield it is also very hard to distinguish all the different kinds of enemies, because while they have specific differences, most of them look very similar. And everything is very chaotic and hard to follow. So, in the end you put down a couple of buildings and hope for the best. If you place them in the wrong spaces. you'd better start over.  I did play for a couple of hours and then looked on Steam for opinions on the game because it felt like I was missing something. And a lot of reviews confirmed my impressions. But I also had to learn that the game needs to to respec your tech tree depending on the level, which simply doesn't feel like a good game design decision.  The game might be fine for people who like chaotic tower defense games without lanes and less strategy and more reactive tactics. But be prepared to retry levels over and over without even knowing how to improve your setup.",

I am a bit biased as I happen to like all Puppygames. I have played this game on my another computer and had to finally purchase a copy for myself on Steam. Also if you have a retail copy puppygames will send you a steam key if you want to play on Steam. Most other company's wont do that for their customers, if you want to play a game you bought from them on Steam you will have to buy another copy on Steam, like Epic Games.  There is a learning cure but not too long and the visuals are great, also like all Puppygames there is some great audio. A fun game that wont put you to sleep and doesn't cost too much.

The great variation in levels keeps the game from getting repetitive. The visuals are crisp and shiny yet retro inspired, and the sound track is amazing. The auto scaling difficulty ensures that all players will find a challenge regardless of skill level. As you should, always research before you purchase, but I assure you this game is a real gem.",
