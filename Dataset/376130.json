            "review_text": "Disclaimer : I didn't play the game alot, because of gameplay and key binding issues. I felt like it was bad ; however, that doesn't mean it's bad overall. I understand some (seemingly a majority) of people may appreciate it, I highly recommand to do just as I did : grab the game, give it a shot, and if you're not ok with it, ask for a refund.    I wouldn't recommand this to everyone, for many (uncommon) reasons.  First of all, there's no way to rebind the keys in this game, and that's a huge concern for me, as a left-handed player. Everything has been thought for a right-handed customer (and even then, most people like to have their own key bindings, I guess). That gave me quite some struggle with my keyboard and my mouse to find a somehow comfortable way to play.  Before going any further, I would like to say that these bindings issues are refraining me from playing anymore of this game. I did not play it alot, I do not know much about the plot and the storyline(s), and from what I've seen, it does not look all that great. Still though, understand that this review isn't covering every single aspect of the game, it would be closer to first impressions, since I'm having a hard time even playing.  The mouse sensitivity. I'm used to a very low mouse sensitivity, and it was so high, I coldn't even figure if which one (from 0 to 11) of the values was the lowest sensitivity.  The music is nearly inexistant or poorly done, decreasing even farther my will of going farther into the game. I know, these musics or the silence are quite a personal and subjective point ; in my opinion, I think I shold not censor what I think of the game.  The graphics are very original, that's what attracted me the most to this game, even if it unfortunately led to quite a disappointment. This game may be good, but the unchangeable binds prevent me from discovering it more deeply.  I can't recommand this to everyone, especially if you're left-handed.",

            "review_text": "This game is very unpolished and very, boring and not very rouge-like. I've bought the game today and have played for two hours trying to have fun with it. The game's atmosphere is fantastic, I love the way it looks and the way it feels, but the guns are all the same (handguns, sub machines, rifles, and shotguns all have the same basic straight line shot with stats that don't make sense. 2 bullet submachine guns? Plz.) and the enemies have this follow and shoot pattern that has no smart AI.There's more to it then that, with only an office and city area (that I've seen), Items will dissappear from your inventory screen, enemies sometimes shoot through walls, sometimes you can't shoot enemies, sometimes the doors that hold key items to progress will be unavaible because another building blocks the door, the lack of differen't missions (there is find 5 clues, kill a target, and 1 bomb piece mission), just overall should not be sold as a finishing project. If the developer update's the game, I will reconsider, because this game has lots of potential as a good sci-fi rouge-like. Until then, spend your 10 dollars somewhere else.",
