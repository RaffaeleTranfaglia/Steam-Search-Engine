            "review_text": "A+  Absolutely fantastic game, much better than the first (and I loved the first). Changes to the talent system made sense and only served to streamline gameplay. Cassia is a wonderful character. Whomever came up with her should get paid twice.   Good gameplay! Your strategic decisions matter, but not so much that you can't save a tactic going wrong. I think it's a bit harder than the first, but I keep coming back to this one.  One major complaint: Activating a map with 40 enemies on it and then forcing a player to sit through each of their turns to get to their 2 minutes of gameplay is not fun. Rare, but annoying.",

Not only do you play the 4 heroes, but you can also add mercs in your battle. such as battlemage, black ogre, assasin, ect ect. And all your actions will have a different ending on the game, depending if your actions were good or bad. Spells, actions, weapons, game play is excactly the same as the first game, except you can control chimeras with the hellhorn which dosnt really help in the end of things.  8/10  eNjoy ^-^",

Less puzzles and more combat focused then the first one (and a bit easier, but not necessarily a flaw, as the first one was sometimes frustrating), the story of the game follow the battles of the Silver Spider Army. Big battles, heroes, mercenaries and mythical creatures will make your day.  A must buy for me.",

            "review_text": "I was skeptical to buy this game based on the reviews I read here on Steam. I am happy to say that I am so glad i ignored them! This was a great game. The mechanics are certainly scaled back from the first game, however any review should be based on how well a game stands on its own. So with that being said I greatly enjoyed the storyline. It was just engaging enough to carry you through the story, while not being too overbearing. I like the mercenary/troop upgrade system and also being able to supplement my battles with mercs to suit my combat needs. The only negative aspect, for me, was that even on easy some of the absolute randomness of the battles made some maps almost impossible, and others so easy you almost didnt even have to think about it. I found that the fast pace of the game had my team and mercenaries upgrading their skills formidably after every fight, which was different from the first game (or most RPGs). That made each new fight an excercise in 'lets see what this new ability does' which kept it very fresh for me. I like the fact that there really are a few different paths to take to the end of the game. This and the random nature of the fights gives the game some level of replayability that is enjoyable.  The biggest downfalls are not dealbreakers, but for me they are: -Lack of ranged party member. If you do not roll your main character with bows or crossbows, you will not have a follower with that skillset. in the later game you could use excess points for this, but not for the first 3/4. I would like to try out a mage or warrior type but those are already covered with your 'premade' party. -Cumbersome tooltip to tell if a new item is an upgrade. You have to physically click on the CURRENT item and then hover over the new item in question. It works, but its not explained. -Annoying 'break the crystals before you can damage enemies' fights. seriously, just add extra enemies if you want it to be harder or at least only do this to us ONCE :P -Removal of base stats (strength/Dexterity/Etc). I understand why and it works, it is just a big departure. -Addition of enurance as a combat ability 'mana'. I am kind of on the fence with this because in the first game you could spam hard hitting abilities and now you have to think on that until your regeneration is higher. I like it but again, its a big departure. -little to no side quests.   Positives: -actual storyline which is just interesting enough to pull you through the campaign but not complicated enough to make you skip tons of lore materials or quest dialog. -combat system is fun and rage inducing at the same time. The Guard ability on crossbows is rediculously fun when it executes well! Some of the spells are so fun to cast that you always look forward to doing it. -easy to understand and navigate map system. The bonuses you get from each capture point are very well presented and you can intelligently plan your own route of attacks to gain the upgrades you prefer instead of being stuck on a preplanned route. -nice system of character skill upgrades that upgrade very fast. You will always feel relatiuvely powerful, especially if you pay attention to the difficulty rating on each point of the map. -More but I cant think of them all.   Overall for the money this is a great turn based RPG. Dont let the nay sayers talk you out of it. Its one of the best uses of 5 bucks in a while.",

Positiv:  - Good balancing over all - Well implemented Characters - Interesting Story - many different tactics are possible - Story changes while progressing - many different types of enemys - Hight rate of individualisation - Your decisions have impact on story progress  Negativ or Optimatizations for the next part (hehe): - Monsters as Charcters in your party (Minotaurs f.e.) - More content than 50 hours on hard - No pre skilled Characters! (It will take you to enhance the given skills to not have wasted points) - an additional class to play with (Shapeshifting / Summoning Druid maybe) - Rotating Camera - More optional Chests (hard to get ones) - slightly more challange on harder difficulty levels, maybe due to the point above - Warfare and so on just needed on one charcter to get infos (havent Skilled it, just read that you will need it on everyone when you want to get Infos every time) too much waste of points for optional information otherwise - More different Equipment to enhance individualisation more over - Focus more on controlling battle, instead of movemt (Takate Spidermap f.e.)

            "review_text": "Another great game for anyone who loves turn based combat.  Compared to Blackguards 1, the battles last a lot longer and require much more strategic decision making even before starting them (what kinds of mercenaries do I want to use this time? which heros will accompany them?) furthermore all maps seem to be virtually littered with interactive objects to either loot or utilize against your enemies.  The game mechanics introduced in Blackguards 1 have been simpified for this sequel, without removing any of their strategic complexity.  My personal favourite part of the game are the decisions and consequences, I am extremely glad that there is no karma meter in this game. Instead, your decisions on how you treat the people you conquer and those that travel with you have consequences within the boundaries of the game and it's story.   All in all I can recommend this game to anyone who enjoys turn based combat and a rich story that truly allows to be a vile conquerer or a freedom fighter with a heart of gold.",

            "review_text": "Blackguards 2 plays quite differently from Blackguards 1. While I preferred the first game's character customization with the stats, the battles in 2 were more intense and included many more combatants. The random number generator was significantly less frustrating. It's hard to pick a favorite. Both are amazing TRPGs. Some believe this game feels like DLC for #1, and while I understand how you can get that impression (most music tracks in #2 are from #1), the world map and battles play quite differently. There's enough content here to justify the sequel status, in my opinion.  What I liked about Blackguards 2. * Battles were very intense. The player can't always win with brute force (in fact, a great deal of battles will result in defeat if the player opts for brute force). I took ONE LOOK at the field during the fight against the druid, my group surrounded by the treant chimearas, and didn't think there was any hope of success. I ended up succeeding on my first attempt with the help of 2 well-placed fireballs (they unexpectedly grouped together). A lot of battles had me thinking 'What the heck am I going to do to win this?!' and occasionally required a second attempt. * The return of Takate, Zurburan and Naurim from 1 was appreciated.  * Huge battles. The number of combatants in #1 (the unit portraits) never exceeded my screen's capacity, but the majority of the battles in #2 wrapped around. * Contains multiple endings. I think if I had played differently, the main character survives. (I'll be back, just you wait #2.) * The ability to have a magic-user wearing armor without penalty potentially allows for some very interesting hybrid options for Zurburan and the main character. * I felt there were more than enough character points to complete what I wanted for all of my characters.  What I didn't like. * Stats were dropped completely, dumbing down character customization and nearly completely removing the table-top RPG feel that the first game had. This loss of stats affected the spells a lot. The creators decided to hold on to every spell from #1 and alter them to keep them relevant. I don't think it worked. Many spells became nearly useless.  * I prefer an adventuring party with mercenary assistance over a conquering horde. Having to defend territories already claimed was a nuisance. I hope it wasn't added just to increase play time. * The narrator's voice annoyed the snot out of me. I found myself pressing multiple buttons trying to shut him up, as I had already read the words. * The story was there, but it was narrated more than acted out with the characters.   Overall, this provides more of what I'm looking for. More tactical RPG awesomeness. I'm glad I didn't pass this series up.",

The game was not very deep and once you figured out a simple strategy, you could take that all the way to the end without the need to switch things up.  The game was also rather annoying when it forces you to do things you just don't care about. Or when the 'dynamic feature' of the bad guy attacking your cities and you must defend it only with simple units... the annoying part about this is the actual time it takes for movement of units. These little counter-battles end up taking the longest and are not very interesting or fun.  This game lacks depth and seems rushed.",

            "review_text": "Blackguards 2 contains almost nothing new, but represents an interesting mix of good features of other games: strategic map with mission selection reminding of Warlords Battlecry 3, inter-mission scenes and dialoges recall of Starcraft 2 and tactical battle system similar to Expeditions: Conquistador (I had not played Blackguards 1 prior to its sequel). I liked the game but for new players I would suggest one trick I should have been sticking to from the beginning: set difficulty to easy (unless you adore this combat system) and - optionally - try to play through without a single failed mission as a compensation for easiness. Easy difficulty will allow you to play missions faster which otherwise consume too much time due to unchangably slow animation. I would not say that battles are boring, however this game is about story, characters, dialogues and strategic choices in the first place - and they are really good; I often had a feeling that battles just distract me from this core part of the game. Moreover, there is no actual character generation and this may drastically decrease 'battle immersion' and overall interest for some players. As for people who enjoyed Blackguards 1, they may dislike the sequel due to the above-mentioned and overall simplification of tactical mechanics.",
