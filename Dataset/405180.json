            "review_text": "From Impulse Game Game Studios LLC comes 123 Slaughter Me Street, a Sesame Street parody with a morbid horror twist. You play as an escaped criminal who climbs the roof of an abandoned building to evade police cruisers. The roof collapses under you, leaving you with one option; to find your way out of the pitch dark corridors. You have a twisted ankle, thus you can't run, and your flashlight took a beating on the way down so it's difficult to keep on. Will you survive to see another day?  Many people will call this title a Five Nights at Freddy's clone, which in essence is partly true. It definitely has taken inspiration from the aforementioned jumpscare king, but 123 Slaughter Me Street does put an interesting spin on its gameplay. You walk down a dimly lit hallway with a flickering, neon Exit sign that lingers tantalizingly in view, your goal is to get there and go down to the next floor; there are a total of 7 to beat, each with their own challenges and sometimes collectibles to unlock. Within the tight corridors are doorways that may potentially either house enemies, or will have one jump out of. As well, you can look behind you to keep an eye out for The Follower; more on that later. Spacebar controls your flashlight, and sometimes you have to mash it a few times to get it to turn on since it's damaged.  There are only three enemy types in this installment, though more were originally planned. You have The Follower, who will appear behind you and make trash rattle to let you know that he's there. He's a big blue goat, and is most likely a spin-off of Cookie Monster; he represents the police chasing the criminal. There's also The Greeter, a giant pink bird that pops out from the doorways; this is the only enemy referred to as a girl, and it represents a little girl that the criminal killed. Last but not least, there's The Waiter who waits within the doorways of the halls, he'll let you know he's there by his growl; he represents a guard dog that the criminal killed.  123 Slaughter Me Street has really great potential to turn into a fantastic series with a well fabricated story, but unfortunately it fails in quite a few areas. There's just not enough atmospheric audio to create a tense environment, which leads to the game ultimately not being scary despite its dim setting. In turn, this makes the jumpscares not very scary at all; in fact after the first 3 or so, they completely lose their touch altogether. It's also easy to know when to expect a jumpscare once you learn the traits and mechanics of each puppet. Another factor is the unforgiving and sometimes impossible RNG of the three puppets. At one point I was right in front of the exit sign, I heard a growl in the doorway, The Greeter jumped out, and The Follower was about 2 seconds away from killing me. I literally was screwed no matter what I did, thus making it impossible to finish the level on that run. This is something that needs to be altered for the next game, as it's completely unfair gameplay that inevitably frustrates gamers.   Even though it has its share of problems and a short play time, 123 Slaughter Me Street is surprisingly entertaining. Other than a radio broadcast and a short cutscene at the beginning and end of the game, there's not much story; the potential is there for the developer to build on it and create something deeply engaging. It could easily rival Five Nights at Freddy's, if the appropriate time and effort is put into it. However, the asking price is very steep for such little content. If you enjoy jumpscare horror games, grab this one on sale.   Rating:  3.0/5.0  - Average, can take it or leave it.",

            "review_text": "You're fleeing the scene with the cops on your tail as you hear the sirens just down the street. In panick you enter what seems to be an abandoned apartment building, and you take shelter from the cops in the 7th floor. Only to find that this building is not abandoned. Far from it, as you soon find yourself running from your life back down to ground level...  This game is overall good, especially if you enjoy jumpscares. The game can get dry after a while, but I can assure you that the first jumpscares will make you jump out of the chair! I certainly did.  Pros: - Creepy sounds - Effective jumpscares (At least in the beginning) - Challenging gameplay - Cheap  Cons: - Jumpscares get dry after a while - Graphics not the best - Controls are a bit sluggish - All the levels are only slightly different from one another  ",

But really it's not, they're just being closed minded cause the monsters in SMS could eaisly be mixed with animatronics. In my opinion SMS is its own unique little game that needs some credit and support. Play it for yourself is my advice, really it's a fun game! :D",

            "review_text": "I kinda wanted to both enjoy and see how bad this game was after all the bad rap it got recently, and how some idiots were going like 'Is this going to be the biggest horror game this year?!?'   So, basically.....This game plot's kinda cliche, you are running away from the police and you fall inside of some abandoned building with killer....Puppets? I'm not even sure.   Now, for the gameplay. This is pretty awkward. This seems like a first person horror game at first, but it's not really that. You can only move forward, and turn around to face behind you. No, you can't go back, and this is a problem when it comes to certain enemies. I'll talk about it in a bit. You can also look to the sides to check if there's a cute cuddly monster on the perpendicular corridors. In this game, you're in a long ♥♥♥ corridor. where, as I said before, you may only move forward. To the left and right of the corridor, there are random perpendicular corridors that spawn enemies now and then. You go from point A to point B, simple, right?   It is at first. You just rush through the seventh floor, and the enemy behind you can't catch you. Then, you move into the sixth floor, and this is where it kinda gets annoying. There's a new enemy now that pops out of the aforementioned perpendicular corridors. You can't tell where it's going to pop up UNTIL you are right next to the corridor, and then it will show it's ugly face. Just blast it with the flashlight, and it will go away. Now, if you are rushing, you will NEVER see it coming, you'll just encounter that monster's jumpscare. So, you gotta stutter step all the way each time you encounter doorways, and rush the other part of the corridor, or else the big fuzzy monster will ♥♥♥♥ you.  On the next floor, you also gotta watch out for growling in said doorways, you gotta check those long, dark corridors, shine your flashlight, and stun another monster hiding there, or it's game over. Yes, you might sometimes go past the doorway accidentally, because when you stop moving, there's some momentum that might ♥♥♥♥ up your chance to peek inside of a doorway.  When I thought FNAF was cheap with it's jumpscares at times, relying mostly on that, this game....Oh god, it's even worse. You can encounter a jumpscare less than 5 seconds into the game, and you know what they say. If you're being jumpscared each 5 seconds, it will lose it's magic REALLY FAST. It's not even scary after a while.  Now, about the flashlight. It sucks. Let's move on......  Why does it suck? Because it only stays on for a few seconds, and it's quite unreliable, sometimes you just gotta 'smack it'.   The best part of the game is the cheesy, glorious jingle after you finish a level, eat your heart out FNAF.  There's a bit of a spoiler here....Watch your flashlight during the cutscenes, or the game will troll you!  So, I'd say, buy this on a sale if you want, the magic will fade rather quickly, but you will have a few laughs that make this worthy of a random night with friends or alone. It's not the worst I've played, but it's just quite lackluster at the moment.",

            "review_text": "Awesome game! I went to play the game and I also saw all the jumpscares but I am still afraid to play. Whenever I try to play I just wind up closing the game. I am too scared to play but I just played I got through the first floor (7th floor) on my 5th try. First time I got jumpscared I jumped and landed on my chest. Second time I actually played and got frustrated because DUH I don't know how to play. I went to the tutorial and it showed me the controls and what to do. As other people pointed out, it doesn't tell you what to do if 'The Follower', 'The Greeter', 'The Waiter', or the 'Devil Elmo' appear. So I watched some videos on it and I saw what to do. Still uncertain about the 'Devil Elmo' but It gave me some advice. I am glad about that. First, seeing people fail ingame. Then, seeing what to do if they appear. It was quite enjoyable to watch. The jumpscares to me are very affective and always catch me off guard. 'The Follower' is really quick and hard to keep away. That I want fixed for easier gameplay. It is still a fun and hard game to play and I still recommend it! So for those who want to play, play away!",

            "review_text": "This game was recommended to me when I was streaming one time and decided to try it out. Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy it for very long.  Pros: 123 Slaughter Me Street has a good plot to work with. It's simple, but it works. The gameplay is good, too. Again, it's simple but it works. It's also unlike anything I've seen before. The design of the puppets are good too. It was a good choice to use puppets since they are pretty scary.   Cons: 123 Slaughter Me Street gets hard, fast. I only got to the fifth floor (aka the 3rd level of the game) before I got extremely frustrated and quit. The controls were clunky. They never really worked for me. My character would keep walking when I stopped (which got me killed multiple times), I had trouble turning around, I would turn to the side and not be able to face forward again, and stuff like that. The graphics are, mediocre, at best. The hallways work since the game has a dark atmosphere but when it came to the puppets, they looked bad. The puppet's movements were awkward and looks ridiculous. The jumpscares were under whelming too. The puppets were hard to see during the jumpscares, and they looked like they were twitching while some sort of choking noise played. These were never scary, they were annoying.  Conclusion: I don't recommend this game. Sure, there are some good things this game has going, but they don't make up for the frustrating controls, lackluster jumpscares, and the bad graphics. I would give this game a 4/10.",

            "review_text": "Up front: I really enjoyed playing through this game!  So yes, some obvious FNAF relationships here: seemly cuddly animatronics, progressively difficult levels, a general sense of paranoia of 'WHERE DID YOU COME FROM??' But in addition you have a humerous adaptation of Sesame Street and gameplay mechanics that make this game stand apart. I have always felt that FNAF would created its own horror sub-genre of games. This game is probably the first of many (that isn't a Five Nights at ______) to take a true step in that direction.  There are only two minor things that I didn't like about this game. First, I wish there was some lore around why this place exists, where did they come from, who made them, etc. BUT I'm sure many of these questions will be answered in the sequel (which I am looking forward to). Second (and bear with me), I wanted it to be harder and with more mechanics/creatures. I keep seeing a lot of people say that this game is difficult to the point of impossible, but I didn't share that same experience. I managed to catch on to a strategy farely quickly and was able to beat the game fairly quicker than I expected to. I WANTED SO MUCH MORE!  So bottom line, I recommend this game for any horror genre fanatic who loves a little bit of a challenge. I personally really enjoyed the game and I am looking forward to the sequel, which hopefully will include some new mechanics and lore that will put our questions to rest.",

Top that off with the dark story and you have a very interesting game   Pros The creature designs with the Follower,Greeter and Waiter are all very nice my personal favorite would be the Greeter  Even though this game is insane with it's rage factor the pacing of the difficulty from floor to floor is still very good  Theres a very dark and cryptic story hidden within this game and like any good mystery it's always fun to dig deeper and see what you can find The outro song for whenever you complete a floor is just awesome While the game mechanics are simple there also pretty addicting  This game did manage to scare me  Cons  I think this game should have an options menu the controls work well enough but they did take some getting use to if I had the option I'd tweak the turn around key to maybe s or shift and maybe the flashlight to a click command  Personaly I'd prefer it if I could look left or right whenever I wanted to rather than only at specific parts I think the ability to turn around after looking either left or right would have helped alot in reducing some unnecessary rage   Overall I'd recommend this game to anyone thats a fan of both rage and horror games personally I think the price is fair enough but some may disagree with me on that so you could wait for a sale but I don't think that would be necessary",
