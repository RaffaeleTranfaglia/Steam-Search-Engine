            "review_text": "As far as Tower Defense games go,  Sentinel  is a work of art. It combines some of the best and simplistic elements and crafts them together to form one excellent and strategic game that is very fun to play in bursts.    Sentinel  has the basic Tower Defense gameplay, defending against hordes of oncoming enemies (or 'Viruses' in this case) each with different strengths and weaknesses. It's main feature that gives it it's individuality aside from it's futuristic digital theme is probably the power consumption mechanic. Without any units of power, your defenses can't function. For each defensive object ('Towers' or 'Anti-Viruses' or whatever you want to call them) you have deployed on the grid, you are supplied with one additional unit of power on top of the amount you are provided with by default (this varies from level to level), each defense can use up to 5 units of power, 1 being the minimum amount required to be funcitonal, 2 units through to 5 units supplies the defense with a strength and / or range boost. It sounds a little bit complicated, but it's very easy to learn after a few minutes of play.  Managing power in  Sentinel  can be very difficult and requires a lot of micro-managing, particularly because more often than not you'll need to sacrifice one of your operational defenses in order to activate another one on the other side of the grid. This game actually requires you to think rather than blindly placing defenses all over the place, especially in the bonus levels, just another thing that makes  Sentinel  great.   One of the other things pushes the right buttons for me is the theme and art-style in  Sentinel , as you can tell from the screenshots and trailer it has cyber and futuristic features which is already a selling point to me, but on top of that it also includes some rthym elements, meaning that the background music ties in well with the gameplay. Already a definite must-have for my collection.  It's simple and minimalistic menu interface and level selection themes are also really well made, the game is just very easy on the eyes and pleasant to look at.  The interface is very simple and user friendly, thus easy to understand and can be picked-up very quickly, things like the radar will be crucial to your efforts when you begin playing and have learned the strengths and weakneses of each enemy.   The game is however not without some flaws, it has a 'Gate' system which requires you to complete levels to acquire credits (at least, that's what I call them) in order to pass through to the next stages, while I don't have a problem with this mechanic, it will likely feel grindy and tedious after a while as the basic level completion credits are not enough to pass through all of the gates, you have to acquire more credits by defeating those levels again without the core taking any damage at all from incoming enemies, much easier said than done on a number of levels. This isn't a problem for those of you that like a challenge, but it can slow down progressing through the game a fair bit as all it takes is one virus to slip through to the core to force you to restart the level once again.  So all in all, considering the fact that this is a game that I acquired in a cheap bundle, it's a bloody good one. If you're into Tower Defense or Strategy games, add this one to your collection, it's a very affordable and fun game to play for when you're in that 'I have nothing to play' mood. Honestly, I just wish there were some more levels to play as for me it ended too soon.   Matthew Brown, please consider a Sentinel sequel or some DLC.",

            "review_text": "Do not buy this game unless you love techno music, and bright lights. By love I mean, have posters on your walls of techno bands, your ipad is 3/4th techno music, and so on. The game doesn't even do that right you look at dubstep and how it has a drop and different pitches, this is more like techno generic song one A, then on to game two remix of generic song one A, and so forth. There is no other music that I came across in my hour of play, and an hour which gave me a head ache.    The music in the game plays no part in how the tower defense handles. It is no surprise that as of writing this the front page does not have a video, for it it did people would see it for what it truly is. If that's not bad enough, the back round on the screen is always exploding in some bright, in your face way with, with sound wave bars, or just odd shapes. The best way to describe this is if you have ever been to a club, stood in the middle of the dance floor, had people bumping into you, as you stare up into a strobe light and let the mind numbing, repetitive remix of the same song you heard the last 4 song melt your brain.    The tower aspect of the game alone is not too bad, it can offer a challenge, and there is a volume slider in the game so you could turn the in game music off all together, and play your own music, but you would still have to deal with the brightness.   At times the screen will also shake, making it feel like your in a boat, or middle of a club, trapped with little air, surrounded by mindless sheep.   The way the gameplay handles, is simple, but never rewards you on winning a match, more of, yup that's nice go away do the next one like a chore. I find it hard to believe even those who love techno music will enjoy this, but no doubt someone will, and be that as it may.",
