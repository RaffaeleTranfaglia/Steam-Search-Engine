            "review_text": "Beautifully made empire building game in a non-fantasy setting of medieval Europe. Furthermore, it is not like Total War (in a positive way, I'm a TW-fan myself). It focuses more on the strategic, econimcal and diplomatic aspects than TW. GA: Medieval offers an enjoyable, fully narrated campaign, alternatively an 'open world' play mode and multiplayer mode. I have not yet tested the multiplayer, but will update the review once I have.   My impressions so far from --- (very bad) to +++ (very good):   Stability: +++  No crashes and no issues with alt-tabbing in and out of game.  Music: ++  Nice, soft medieval background music.   Graphics: ++   Better than the map view of current Total War titles so far. Lacks the unit details of TW, though, but zoom-in and zoom-out is far more smooth plus the weather details are better.  Gameplay: +++  In the campaign, you start as the ruler of a small city and have to increase your wealth and power by military and diplomatic means. The missions you receive during the campaign will help you with that. GA:Medieval has a very nice balance of micro- and macromanaging, which is something that I imagine is very hard to design. E.g. you can set up trading routes for your traders within seconds and just let them trade between these cities on their own. They do a good job with that. However, you can still take over manual control to send out traders to buy or sell the exact items in the exact quantities you need. You may stumble over 'adventure sites' with your scouts which most times will result in small combats and a bit of loot, if you manage to get the upper hand. Diplomacy is no one-way communcation in this game. AI-Characters may contact you with diplomatic offers or even missions, which may raise or lower your diplomatic standing with other parties. You can decide which buildings to build in your cities, but have to keep an eye on what you want to produce with them, how much and what kind of ressources they need and if there are enough workers in your city to run the production building. Overall very nicely done with a lot of choices to be made.  Tactics: -  Since I mentioned Total War in my review, I thought it neccessary to touch the topic of 'tactics' this game offers. There is no separation of strategic map movement and tactical battles. There is one map which handles both. You do not control the movement of units in battle and so forth. You send them into battle and can pull them out, if you feel that you have to. In this aspect, GA:Medival is far, far behind of TW. If you think GA:Medieval is another TW-clone and you play TW because of the tactical battles, then GA:Medieval will be a vast disapointment in this matter. On the plus site, units in GA:Medieval tend to follow a rock/paper/scissors mechanic, e.g. Archers beeing superior against infantry, but weak against cavalry etc. So you have the tactical option of chosing which units to send into battle against which enemy.  Multiplayer: ?  Not yet tested.  I'll add more info to my review once I've gather more insight in the game.   EDIT 1:   The first good impressions did no lie. It's good and it's getting better, including NOT A SINGLE graphic or game bug, crash or other technical issue after hours of continous gameplay. Remember that this is the first day of the game's release! Furthermore, and I try not to spoiler, I want to let you know that the advancement of your rank isn't just a number that increases over time. Entire new aspects of the game become available and you continously shift from micromanaging to macromanaging - without losing the ability to micromanage units, cities and so on if you feel you should intervene.    EDIT 2:  The story of the campaign is easy to follow and surprises with some 'interesting' turns of events. Again, I don't mean to spoiler. That said, I just got the steam achievement 'Got Laid!'. :D   EDIT 3:  There's far more trading to be done than I tought. Although you can 'fire and forget' your trader units and send them on a trading route of cities you specified where they buy and sell stuff, you will still want to micro at least one trader unit. I'm still early in the game and maybe the weight of the trading aspect will shift once I've advanced my rank from names that sound mercantile (Merchant, Landlord, etc.) to more noble titles. I still review the Gameplay as very good (+++), but the focus on trading that I feel in this early stage of the game push the rating a little in the direction of 'only' good (++) without justifying a demotion yet.",

            "review_text": "This game is the epitome of a dumb blonde joke- pretty but empty.  Graphically it's lovely to look at with a well-chosen art style and color palette. The UI is workable and the music is quite pleasant. I'd love if the artists worked on some other strategy games because they did a nice job here.  But the gameplay is the thing and there's not much here. You establish trade routes in which you import and export resources which your cities and other cities produce. After you've maxed out the production, you spam more cities and establish more trade routes. Rinse, repeat and yawn. There aren't any great key decisions, no feeling of truly building an empire or anything like that. It's city spam at its worst.  There is combat in the game but it's lifeless and neither tactial or strategic in scope. It's a rock, paper, scissors affair where generally the most troops are the victorious troops. While I didn't expect combat control like Total War this really is very bland. Not to mention that a well run economy will just allow you to buy everything anyway.   So what you end up with is a game that is devoid of a lot of decision making or components to keep things interesting. Given the larger number of decent strategy titles out there, this game commits the cardinal sin of being extremely dull. It's not a matter of it being worth you money. It's not worth your time.

Coming from someone who has played a lot of Paradox games, Civilization and the like, I can safely say it's not a bad game.  However it's not as good as it could have been, and that's what seems to have annoyed a lot of people. All the groundwork is there for this to be a truley spectacular game, but it just falls frustratingly short. Falling back to cliché car analogies - it's like someone took the time to design and make a very beautiful sports car, but did the interior lazily with some bad IKEA furniture at the last minute.  It's missing that extra finish, those few extra mechanics which make the game far more fun and engaging (this could be anything from a political system, to more building options, etc.). Hopefully the devs will add this kind of stuff in, because it has so much potential to be a great game, but at the moment it's just a bit shallow.  Also the game runs flawlessly on Linux ;).",

You don't really do anything with them. there are a few upgrades you unlock a few buildings you build but nothing makes it feel like an actual town.   the idea of the map is cool.... but it needs to be way bigger if it's representing the entire known world at the time. Even if you crunch as many new settlements together as you can, all of denmark can hold like 3. Pretty sure denmark has more then 3 cities.   In order to Win at this game, you have to orginize trade routes effectively. cool... but then you build armies. Are we suppose to... be a nation? or like... run a corporate trading empire? like nothing matches. There is no other forms of power other than the 'player' and opposing AI. It just feels so awkward. If we play an entire nation... there should be a way higher empasis on Military power, but there is not.   The whole world feels Dead outside of the player's interaction. The only thing happening is what the player is doing, and even than, as i said earlier, the towns still feel dead.   Overall i think if they toned down the map... so it's not representing ALL of the known world that can only support like a hundred cities, but maybe just an Area. Hell, it does not even need to SAY where, i would probably enjoy it more if there was just a Random map that said map02 and was Not EU.   Over all the game is not really BAD... it's just... not great... there is nothing that stands out to me. I love the hell out of games Like this but this one they just did such a minimum effort into creating it i can't recomend it, to anyone. I regret buying it, and i don't regret buying many games... hell i bought games i litterally have not even installed since i bought them some 2 years ago that i felt was a better purchase than this.",

Right now - bleh.  From combat standpoint you'll have more fun watching paint dry, or your dog chase his tail since he'll be spinning in circles, just like units during battle.  This game is shockingly boring and just... unfun so far. Very unexpected, and a shame. An expensive shame.   I think I'll have to see if the Steam economy is working and try a Refund action.",

            "review_text": "For starters, I throw myself in there with the category of gamer who has tried this game that: 1) Understands that Grand Ages: Medieval is primarily an economical/historical trade simulator, not an epic military strategy game and 2) Is feeling that there is something missing or that it lacks a certain 'life' and depth to it that keeps it enjoyable over the long run.  I honestly wanted to see a historical trading simulator that lived up to or surpassed Patrician, the Guild, Anno (or Dawn of Discovery)...to name a few. I can play games such as the ones I mentioned for hours and still want more. This game doesn't seem to do it for me in that same way. So, for the time being, until the devs can add some things that bring this game to life, I can't recommend it.   Keep in mind: I've only logged 18 hrs into the game at time of review and will come back and edit if I need to add or delete anything if the game is improved. But for now, I'll give a quick run down of good and bad, and include suggestions to fix the 'bad', based on my current experience:  GOOD - Beautiful graphics - Nice, ambient soundtrack - Challenging market supply and demand with trade routes you can manage and monitor for profitability - Challenging computer AI  BAD - An extremely limited amount of goods. It won't take you long to acquire and produce them before you're having to fight against market saturation and trying to keep prices from plummeting, which will send you into bankruptcy. I'd like to see twice the number of goods in-game than what is already there. Also, I think consumption of goods needs tweaked. You're more often than not producing more than your cities are consuming.   - Diplomacy, I've noticed, boils down to how much you're willing to bribe your neighbors to get them to join your growing empire. If you go to war, there is no cunning military strategy, only who can spam the most troops to outnumber the other guy so you can take over. Needless to say, the diplomacy aspect needs work. I would tweak the 'Sympathy' that town leaders have for you to increase more with gifts and to decrease slower over time. I'm playing a free game right now and will bribe 20,000 gold to a neutral town and only see sympathy increase by 1-2% with their leader. So, you'll throw loads of money at a town you're hoping to add to your empire with little result.   - The military aspect is badly flawed. Troops are very expensive to maintain and will send you into debt if you recruit too many, competitors and NPC threats will most always be stronger and have more troops than you, troop morale drops quickly and will see your men fleeing from battle, and battles drag out for far too long. I would decrease the troop maintenance cost, add a leader character to accompany troops into battle to keep their morale from flagging, tweak the AI on how quickly competitors/NPC units can field an army, and change the battle schematics to not take years or just be a war of, 'the winner is who has more troops than the other guy'.   - Towns are basically just lifeless entities that have no real living, breathing quality to them that lets you feel like you're there. Only the names really differentiate them. So, towns are essentially production centers, a market to sell goods, and a spreadsheet you can pull up. It would be much more life-like if there were more ambient sounds when you're zooming in on your towns to check them out (dogs barking, town crier telling the news of the day, etc) more animations of villagers hustling and bustling in the streets, and the ability to micromanage and develop your individual towns where it actually will alter their appearances based on your decisions.    That's all I have for now. At the moment, the game is a very bare bones, but a challenging trade sim....it delivers on that. However, it lacks big on personality and depth that makes you want to explore the world and spend countless hours getting lost in the medieval life of your empire.    Grade: 4.5/10    ",

No need to repeat (copy-paste) most things already written by other posters.  I have played many strategy games since the early the 80s. In 1989-90 I played “The Magic Candle” (and still do via DosBox), a 25 year old medieval fantasy (w/magic) game (2 floppies) with much, much more depth and purpose than this 5+ GB game.  The basics are there, but it needs some mayor rework (town(s) growth and management, trade, full army rework, zillion animal pack attacks, battles) and enhancements (music, politics, thing to do, missions, purpose, etc.) to keep the user interested.

So, it's just a simgame about trading, but with only few products, quite lousy interface &amp; very bad AI traders (they buy &amp; sell at stupid prices, and again, the manual setting won't change much). Sometimes you win millions, sometimes you lose them, but you never really understand why (the trick is just to close down your factories and wait a bit, hoping you're not having some fight on).

Also most of the improvements in the towns are unnecessary and redundant and so are most of the troop kinds. It is basically just about money (perhaps real life was even in medival times, makes sense!). The normal business ideas are a little bit redundant here: For example a quick hint, if you are short of money (for example during taking over Odessa, or to keep armies in the field), take between 1-3 traders off the automatic route and give them 30-40 carts. Then take them to towns slowly fill them with the more expensive goodies (pomp, clothes, meet but also tools, beer, cake, wine and pottery). When they can't take any more (takes a long time), take the trader to Constantinople (or somewhere big) and sell everything at one. Yes, business-wise it sounds silly to buy expensive and sell cheap. But you get almost two million coins at once (think of it as saving under the mattress) which can be uses to buy town or keep armies. If you have more than one trader it can be a few million (useful for Odessa). So don't follow the sensible advice. I don't think this game really captures the essence of a country building game and it is far too much dependent on money. But having finished the campaign I must give it thumbs up although, I don't fancy carrying on with the open games which follows it.",

You can't plan your cities -all you have to do is build them and build certain businesses; people will appear out of nowhere to work in them.   There is no micromanaging trade routes, no setting up production chains, no planning what to make next. The buildings and people to work in them appear almost instantly, so there is no planning what to do when, no strategic thinking, no difficulty and no sense of achievement out of builkding your towns.   While playing this game I was waiting and waiting and waiting for something to do, some aspect where I can plan and manage and have an impact; seems to me there is none.   Don't buy it. If you want a good strategic game like this, go play Patrician or Port Royale. If you think you like GA:Medieval, go on youtube and watch someone play it.

To describe this game... It's a mix of some of the following games:  Venice/Patrician III/Patrician IV [series] (trade) Hegemony series (Supply lines) Knights Of Honor (with updated graphics, but slightly dumbed down/simplistic combat) Paradox Games styled combat  This game is not: COD (Call of Duky, which I will admit I like... but this is not it) Total War (been a fan since the original Shogun... The combat is closer to games like Super Power 2) Paradox Strategy games (love them and own most of them, but the economy is not 'all connected')   I give it a 8.5/10. The Good... I like the Patrician III/IV economy, which is almost 100% in your control (other's merchants can buy your stuff [i think]). The combat... well, lets be honest, is a lot like risk... but with a heavy weight given to class (much like paradox games, some troops do better vs a specific type).   The bad... Well, most people don't like to wait to build their economy (looking at you COD players) before they can build a massive one-sided zerg (like Darkfall). Lastly, the devs need to make a little video on how to develop your economy (for those of you/like me who don't like reading to figure out how to play the game a purchased 1+ weeks back).   Once you play it a few hours (which you will need... as well as restarting a few times) you can build a proper network on cities and traders to balance your resources...

Cons: It seems to be a work in progress, or at least I hope it is still going to be upgraded.  The lack of trade goods is disappointing. Devs- please add ALOT more goods like triple what you have try adding different weapon types as goods (maybe even require these goods for troops) try adding silk, spices, milk, cheese, cows, goats, pigs, chickens, eggs, bread (you already have pastries but bread would be just grain), different types of armor, horses, clay, paper, ink or dyes, sugar, crabs, pearls, gold, silver, split up the metal into copper, and iron, add whales, tea, cotton, cocao, split up the different fruits, ale, whiskey, mead, (this should all be free too because the trade system was supposed to be complex but it's not) Those are just some ideas on trade goods to add to help gameplay.  Trade goods are not regional, so you can get everything all in one area. There is no need to really expand too far or trade with anyone outside of your empire except early on. Devs- please make the goods more exclusive to areas.  Profit margins still need some work. You do not make enough money to cover expenses and actually turn a profit, partially because of the lack of variety and under use of goods in towns (make towns consume more), which causes saturation of the market.   Combat needs to be spiced up. Devs-Make up formations and such. You could set it up to where archers can be flanked and wiped out for instance. Add more troops types. Add the ability to patrol areas to troops or make towers have garrisons that patrol between pairs of towers. With this, you could increase bandit activity for them to fight. Take away the heavily armed and armored bandits for some lighter geared guys. Let's be honest, bandits rarely had full mail, shields and swords.  Add more buildings in cities and maybe take away 1 or 2 types of production in each city IE: drop it from 5 to 4 or 3, to encourage more cities. Make cities revolt or something to add some depth. You could make buildings increase happiness or order as in the TW series and cause other factors decrease it. Add cultural and religious factors to make cities have more depth.  This game has tons of potential and I'm still hopeful that it will become one of my favorites but it really needs some addition content that should mostly be free. I do not mind paying for some of it like maybe different troop types or something but the trade is the biggest issue since this is a trading game. This game should be Civilization, Total War, and Port Royale mixed into one insanely fun game but for now, it needs more content added badly. I can see this with only 10 hours of playing time.

I had a few goes to start with and I found it hard to make the books balance but after playing it for a while and getting to know how the whole thing works (plus a few new starts !) I eventually got a nicely balanced game going on. For me, this is a good sign; the more complex and balanced a game is then the more game play I'm going to get out of it. The graphics are gorgeous and the interface is reasonably easy to operate giving some of the complexities of the game.

Buildings options though tend to run out quickly and the management consists of mostly simple repeating steps. The game balance/difficulty is overall easy and plays slowly. Here I can see what other reviewers hint at and must agree with most of the criticism. On the other hand the game works very well in it's strong fields like UI, presentation, graphics and visiual feedback. The latter meaning a thing I really love: all buildings, in progress or otherwise, the resources of a city, everthing reflects in the game world, a game world with free zoom I might add.  So shortly, If you only read this bit and fly over more reviews - Grand Ages: Medieval is visually nice, technically well executed and has a intriguing story. It falls short on balance or big strategy things and is as easy as repetitive.  I recommend it as the relaxing strategy game for the casual medieval fan. Definitly get it on sale.

The premise is similar to Civilization (and most other empire building games): you start with one small town, build the economy, settlers, armies, then spam cities across the map till you bury your opponents under the weight of your empire.    However, the gameplay is very different from most other games of this type. First, there is much less warfare. The barbarians are relatively passive, and do not constantly attack your cities. Also, armies are expensive, so you fight fewer wars with fewer units.    The biggest difference in Grand Ages compared to most empire games is the economic model. Grand Ages is primarily a trading game. There are 20 commodities you cities need, but each city can only make 5, So trading is required. A large interlocking trade network is key to success. However most of your trading can be automated, so you don't constantly have to keep track of dozens of units like you do in many empire builders.   I said I like this game the longer I play, because the economic system is so very different from other empire building games and takes time to learn. In some games, once you get a few key technologies, your cities will earn obscene amounts of money. But in Grand Ages, the cost of production comes very close to equaling your income from sales. So building more factories to produce more goods is not always a good policy. You must balance production against demand. If you produce more than you can sell, prices will fall, your production costs will be greater than your sales, and you quickly go bankrupt. It takes practice to learn to only build businesses which have enough demand to support them. (I recommend watching some Utube videos dedicated to explaining the economy to help understand how this works.) One huge annoyance is that some of the most important charts on managing your economy and trade routes are buried under layers of screens. Read the forum and watch some videos to find these key charts.  While they are great games, Civ, EU, and Total War have been around for decades, and I find the game play getting really stale. Grand Ages Medieval introduces what I find to be a fresh approach to empire building.   My main gripes are with the poorly organized economic charts, and the very poorly optimized campaign game. I thought the campaign was supposed to introduce you to good gaming practices, but I learned more about game play watching 30 minutes on Utube than in several hours of playing the campaign. The campaign progresses at a snails pace, and did more to hinder my understanding than help. I had to restart several times because my economy kept collapsing when I tried to followed the advice of the narrator.   I would rate this game 8/10, and worth the price compared to similar games.",

            "review_text": "At its core, Grand Ages Medieval is an empire building game. Found your own cities, and expand your empire through either peaceful negotiation, military means, or creating settlers. Each city location has access to strategic resources, and it is up to you to decide what is produced in each city, based on those resources.  Each city can manufacture up to 5 resources (out of 20), which are either consumed by your citizens, or used as trade with other cities. Whilst trading is a big part of the game, it is more important that your citiznes in each city have access to a wide range of products to ensure prosperity. Provide your cities with the goods they need, and your empire will flourish. Fail to do this, and watch your empire crumble.   The balancing act here is to ensure your cities produce a wide range of goods, and then establishing trade routes to pass goods through central hubs to ensure each city has a wide range of products available, and balancing production to ensure you have enough to meet demand, without creating excessive supply which can lead to financial hardships on higher difficulties.   The campaign acts as a basic tutorial, and while it explains some game concepts very well, it completely ignores other key aspects of the game, and if you try to follow the story to the letter, it will probably lead to bankruptcy and frustration. It took a couple of re-starts for me to finish the campaign, realizing what i did wrong and going back and doing things different to get through.  The tech tree appears pretty basic, but depending on what your towns can produce, will depend on what order you unlock things. Quite often, a manufacturing shortage can be solved by investing in a research that increases production, saving alot of money and resources building new manufacturing sites. Also, depending on your starting region, will determine how your military progresses, as regions have basic units they can all produce, as well as units specific to different regions.  The game also gives you a choice on what level you would like to micro manage your empire.. You can manually set your own trade routes, detailing exactly how much to buy and sell in each city on the route, or select auto to have the AI run it for you.. Whilst I am sure the AI does not run 100% efficiently, it does a pretty decent job of ensuring cities have what they need, as long as your hub has the resources to supply.   Overall I have really enjoyed the game.. I find it quite challenging to keep abreast of eveything, and finding the right balance is key.. Building 2 new sites in 1 city, could cause shortages of other goods in your empire, as the population growth leads to more demand for all goods.. It can be difficult to get into, but once you 'get it' I find it to be a fun game, and the devs have so far shown they listen to the community and respond, and are here to make the game better.",

It just doesn't do enough differently or well to justify its price.  Shame really because my original thoughts were positive.",
