            "review_text": "Dungeon Siege is a pretty solid Action RPG in the vein of Diablo. Although it requires some coaxing to get functional on a modern OS it has aged remarkably well and mainly only suffers from somewhat wonky controls (which get worse when you've more party members to manage), a rather awkward camera, and some exception crashes; though in my case that last one plagued the bandit cave area so horribly that it effectively ended my campaign, so your mileage may vary.   Graphics:  The graphics are still pretty passable and in some cases still quite beautiful, no complaints aside from character display UI issues in the inventory screen probably caused by playing on a higher resolution than the game was designed for. Throughout the game, a fairly dark, earthy theme is most-often employed.   Sound:  The game features an excellent, genre-appropriate, soundtrack composed by Jeremy Soule ( Morrowind ,  Oblivion ,  Knights of the Old Republic ...) but has some weird sound effects issues wherein an item drop sound may play when no items are dropped. Some basic, often unconvincing, voice acting is employed for important characters.   Story:  A pretty standard fantasy storyline that doesn't really stand out in any way, although it's not unbearable, it is very linear and can get boring pretty quickly, making it hard to play for extended periods of time. Characters are very basic, as seems very common amongst Action RPGs.   This reviewer gives Dungeon Siege: 7/10 ",

            "review_text": "Great game. A lot like diablo. Dungeons are not instanced, so there is no loading. Its somewhat limited thought. Magic isn't elemental. Fire monsters take as much damage by fire spells as ice monsters. Its somewhat imbalanced, melee is overpowered. The party system and mules are awesome. I just love being able to control a party of heroes instead of only one, but at the same time not a whole army. It is like playing a truly rpg pen and paper by yourself where you control the whole party, or only one hero if you wish. Its not perfect, limited in a lot of aspects, but overall a very enjoyable game with unique features (afaik).",

The reviews I've read from my peers thus far are spot on. This little Tactical-RPG was way ahead of its time. Touted as a 'Diablo killer', clearly inspired by Baldur's Gate the expectations were high (to say the least) upon release.   Admitedly though and to no surprise the fledgling developer (at the time) Gaspowered Games may have bitten off more than it could chew (as the title falls short in many aspects of its predecessors). Still this shouldn't deter you from giving it a go as it is a solid piece of work from start to finish.  Unfortunately however Steam has failed to acquire the Exanpsions which contain necessary patching and multiplayer is relegated to LAN, TCP/IP, Hamachi or GameRanger. All of these options require time and effort to coordinate play with others rather than being able to just jump right in. Still if you like ARPGs give this one a chance.   It should also be noted there were many mods of varying qualities great and small including a couple of conversions such Ultima V &amp; 6 all thanks to the dedicated Dungeon Siege Community -- should you be interested extending the experience.",

            "review_text": "Well, I'm not a big fan of Hack &amp; Slay games in general.  But this one added some elements that made it more interesting for me: Semi-automatic attacks instead of clicking marathons (btw bad for your health), strategic elements like several formations, character behaviour configuration, group separation and finally the ability to freeze the game any time to plan your moves and reorganize your party. And there are easy to confiure hot keys on the fly to get e.g. just your melee fighters together for some special tactics.  But the balancing is a catastrophe. Dungeons are way too long where you can spend hours seeing the same enemies and building blocks again and again. And the AI behaves pretty stupid. They have a very limited field of view and you can easily wake them up one by one or in small groups even when you are surrounded by them in larger halls.  But if you accidentally get into a larger group that hits you a lot: Your health is regenerating very fast. So fast that using health potions is rarily required. And you can find tons of them. Speaking of which there is sooo many loot you can find that it's hard to manage all this stuff and have enough space to get the crap to the next town for sale. Don't let them lie around because they vanish after some time (especially if you change in-/outdoor environments).  At least you can have donkeys in your party that have plenty of storage for all your loot. But then you carry even more stuff around that needs to be organized.   Furthermore the story presentation is boring and you never have the feeling to care about people you meet. They are so dull. And quests are solved when you just did what you should do. That means you don't have to go back to report... it's like magic. This of course leads to a very linear experience. Also the levels are pretty linear. You can only move in restricted areas, you can't fall down and it's hard to die.   Verdict:  There are some good concepts in this game but it isn't executed very well so it gets boring after several hours of playing and finally its only annoying. But playing should be fun and never feel like plain repetitive work, isn't it? Because otherwise you should rather start to work on something useful.",

The dungeons feel overly long, as if they extended gameplay through the sheer length they make your characters walk. The combat is pretty bland. I went almost all archers with my squad since, at the hardest difficulty, 1: Melee gets decimated and 2: It costs no resources unlike spells. It does fairly well but the gameplay is just blah.  99% of the item drops fall into 2 categories: Items you can't wear and Items you can't use. Either all of the drops have stat requirements that are way beyond what my characters can use or they aren't even close to being an upgrade. It's almost exclusively vendor trash.  Leveling: It's pretty much a use a skill get some auto xp gains system. There is no decision making other than what to use. I chose to focus on a single discipline rather than jack-of-all-trades. That said, since I am ranged, my armor selection is pretty ♥♥♥ since it's based on str and int for useage requirements. The choices are poor even if I DID have the appropriate attributes to wear said equipment.  Quests: I'm sorry, there are quests? Basically it's talk to the 3 npcs you'll encounter per chapter then walk linearly through a massive dungeon crawl, completing the quests. Hardly what I'd call quests. There's not really even a reward for doing them that I can see.  It comes down to this: I am playing this through JUST to beat it and play it, but it's not very fun. I was hoping for a NWN-type game and it comes off as an overly long poor diablo clone with a bigger party and crappier combat. My playthrough on the hardest difficulty is basically, set my party to hold/engage freely/strongest target, have them all ranged, then pull with a single guy into range and have the mobs explode. I move the party about 3 feet then repeat. Ranged is kind of necessary since even melee die in 3-4 hits and you can get swarmed by 5+ if you aren't careful. It's a slow slog through dungeons that seem to never end. Since I bought Dungeon Siege 1, 2, and 3 I am hoping the sequels will be much better.  Do I regret buying this? No, I paid like $2.99 or whatever the super Steam sale was, can't regret that. Do I enjoy this game? Nope.",

Dungeon Siege should be forgotten, as it has two major flaws with the game. The Bad: 1. Easy: The game is too due to having regen health, 40 million health potions throwned at you, and the foes you faced being too damn weak. 2. Boring: The game throws several dozens opponents at you on a small map. So every few steps, some might pop out, and you ever kill them or run to attract more of them. But the biggest sin is combat, as melee fighters just auto attack, which leads the game to be walk spot here, sit there as your guys hacks every 200 people on screen. The Good: 1. Presentation: The game has good music (because of Jeremy Soule being the composer), very good gwaphix (for its time, really out of date now), and the game is not buggy.

If you want a game where you just go to town on every sorry enemy that happens to be in your party's vicinity and don't much care for a great story, you've come to the right place!

If you can run it, you can enjoy it. If you've got some brandnew Nvidia/AMD graphics then .. look in the forums before you buy it.   It mostly works quite well, but the AI controlling your party gets really confused sometimes if there are too many groups of enemies and then it gets quite frustrating to play, when your party spreads out and most certainly die.   Avoid death at all costs, because even though resurrection is quite easy (if you stand close enough and you are not in combat at the same time), your character drops all items on the ground on death, that totally clutter the screen and each item needs to be picked individually.. Sheesh.   There is no honour in healing. Since there is no exp gain from healing, setting up a companion to be a healer would render it totally useless in time, because it will never gain levels.   You can have six members in your party AND two Pack-mules(!!).. Awesome. Unfortunately the mules can die too, leaving an even bigger mess to clean up, but its quite rare that they do.  Save often.  It's easy to understand why this game spun a sequel and after playing the second installment I understand why it stopped. The third game, which is the first I played, is something completely different.",
