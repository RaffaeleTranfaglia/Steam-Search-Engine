            "review_text": "Definitely recommended.  Perhaps plot wise this isn't anything new - saving the world from evil is hardly a new theme - but what makes this interesting that you play as Dracula himself. He could be good or bad and that depends literally on the player. Choices matter! That is really an interesting aspect that I haven't really seen a lot on hidden object games. So the story isn't new in its genre, but everything else makes up for it.  So, the characters. Besides Dracula, they're not particularly multilayered, but it doesn't matter. HOGs are rarely as much about characters as they are about playing a detective. In this case, the relationships between characters are quite interesting and change, depending on your choices. It was quite humorous at points too, especially the quarrels between Van and Igor.  The art is really, really nice. Dark on one areas, light on others, more realistic on some and fantasy like on the rest. It was extremely nice to look at. Though the Queen Of Vampires' hair is a bit ridiculous..  Gameplay is pretty easy, but some of the puzzles are hard. And the thing is, that even if there's a strategy guide, it doesn't always offer help. I think it's a slight minus because you immediately lose a chance to get one achievement. If there's a strategy guide, it should have solutions to ALL puzzles, no exception. But there was quite a lot of puzzles I haven't seen in other games - or can't remember at the moment - and nice power ups to collect that helped you along the game.  I don't know if it's my PC or not, but the cut scenes seem a bit... buggy, I guess it's the word. Voice comes on time, but the rest of it doesn't. It's better than in the physical copy, so I didn't mind.  Since I mentioned the physical copy, I have one. I can't use it anymore but the fact that I bought a version on Steam should tell you something. It was one of the first HOGs I've ever played and I still like it a lot. For the price it has, I don't think it's a bad game at all.",

            "review_text": "This title is very similar to (my opinion better) Sherlock Holmes and the Hound of the Baskervilles by the same developer. Comparing the two however, this title seems lacking. Unfortunately, this game also contains a lot of hidden object 'puzzles', even more so than the aforementioned title. Getting through them ends up a chore and annoying when you cannot find an item that more often than not is very hard to see even if you know what you are looking at. The puzzles are similar and they are of adequate difficulty and variety. Whether to a somewhat different pallete,the graphics seem a bit worse, with environments being dull rather than bleak and the models for the few characters appearing being uninteresting.  All those could be looked over by someone with some spare time in his hands who is just looking for a quick adventure game to play. However, add on top of that the ridiculous scenario, annoying 'comic relief' Igor and mediocre at best voice acting, are dooming this game. For all the flaws of the previous installment, Dracula: Origin, it was at least a story that you could take seriously and follow on. The story of Dracula: Love Kills seems as if thought up a few days before release, it is completely unimaginative and uninteresting. Replayability is not good either, doing a second run for achievements seemed for like a chore and I was able to breeze through it in about 2 hours on easy mode, realising most of the game time is spend in hidden object 'puzzles'.  For adventure and Dracula fans, avoid. This title is simply not worth it, even as part of a bundle as I got it, I wish something of better quality had taken its place.",

            "review_text": "For those who played Dracula: Origin - this game is quite different, more of the cookie-cutter HO/puzzle/adventure kind, albeit with special abilities and two different endings based on your decisions, which makes it distinctive in this genre. It also has 2D painted art instead of the previous episode's 3D.  Pros:  + Beautiful graphics, especially some HO scenes and the character art + The UI is very modern + Atmospheric and catchy music + The puzzles of the first half of the game are quite easy + It's nice to see all the items I need to find in a HOS right from the beginning + Interesting to see the locations of the previous game (Dracula: Origin)  Cons:  - The character accents sound horribly fake and exaggerated, especially Dracula's and the women's - They seem to have reused a lot of the music and sound effects from Sherlock Holmes and the Hound of the Baskervilles - The UI is a bit  too  helpful in Difficult mode, it shouldn't sparkle interactable items at all - The late-game puzzles are too difficult, had to skip almost all of them on the first playthrough - The item names in the HOS are often imprecise and the game sometimes doesn't accept potential matches because the creators thought of a different but similar item in the scene - the same 'collect pieces of shields/coats of arms' story progression as in the Sherlock Holmes game, they could have come up with something a bit more original - also, many puzzles repeat from the Sherlock Holmes game  Suggestion:  ~ I like the option for setting difficulty, but it would be nice to add advanced difficulty options for those who want to customise it. Eg. I like easy puzzles, but also don't like when every interactable items shine and sparkle.",

            "review_text": "This game made an excellent overall impression. The format, while still familiar, is a welcome break from the cookie-cutter puzzle/HO products that populate the market. Not only are the HO scenes well crafted (they rely on clever or innocuous placement of objects rather than the common cop-outs of fading or obscuring them), but the progression sequences, while heavy on the collection of item sets for puzzles, also at least tend to make consistent sense, as opposed to all those games in which you might be asked to forgo your crowbar and find the tiny key to that shatterable glass cabinet. Indeed, the general flow of the story is far more linear and logical than the winding, obtuse, quasi-Wonderland adventures into which we are so often flung. The puzzles are mostly in the same vein of those you'd find anywhere, but a sprinkling of fresh ones (a version of the game Connect Four, for example) keeps them interesting. The most unique addition is the inclusion of vampiric powers - fueled, naturally, by imbibing blood - which act as keys to otherwise inaccessible items.  The big problems here are the game's storytelling, attempts at roleplay, and sheer repetition. The interpretation of the supposed source material (the Bram Stoker novel) is downright laughable when it isn't simply cringeworthy. Dracula himself looks like he was scanned from the cover of a bad romance novel, and sounds - I kid you not - like Antonio Banderas; Van Helsing, an unassuming Dutchman in the book, is rendered as an imposing English noble with a fashion sense ironically more akin to what we traditionally associate with the titular vampire; and Igor is just a pathetic character with an even more pathetic voice who quickly becomes the Jar Jar of the game. The game also tries its hand at roleplaying, letting you choose either to 'turn' or set loose each of the three or four minions of the villainess, promising that there will be 'consequences' to your choice. In practice these consequences are reduced to a different outcome at game's end, which for most of us comes second fiddle to the actual puzzle/HO gameplay for which we're really signing up. The other motivation in these choices is supposed to be securing blood to charge Drac's special powers, but since the use of these powers is always necessary to proceed, the game is forced to give you the required number of (scarcely concealed) bottles of blood, simply plucked from the environment, which renders the only 'consequence' the need to take three seconds to find these in each scene. Finally, the game's formula does get quite old after a time - collect tools and sets of puzzle pieces, complete puzzles, repeat until chapter is complete, repeat until game is complete - but, let's be honest, that's kind of just expected.  Despite all this, the truth is that this game is actually a breath of fresh air. Longer than most, far more innovative than most, and sometimes more creative than most, it's the first of the genre in a long time to make me feel like I was playing an entirely new game. That means something in this market, don't you think?",
