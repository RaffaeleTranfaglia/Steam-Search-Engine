            "review_text": "A traditional old school turn based rpg with a very amazing cast of characters and story surrounding the world of Ara Fell, The story of this game follows the adventures of Lita LeCotta who is a very cute, snappy, and funny character who keeps getting herself into trouble with her typical bad luck xD the adventure begins just as she is exploring a ruin with her friend Adrian and she falls in a trap to find a secret room that has a powerful ring that bestows power to its wielder but she doesn't know this and puts it on cuz it looks pretty lol.   The game's sprite art looks really good on all of it's wonderful locations in this games world even for an rpg maker game, soundtrack is surprisingly nice and catchy, and the gameplay is a pretty solid turn based rpg with an action meter for your characters turns that reminds me of Final Fantasy 7, also i have not run into any bugs while playing this game so far, and from what i have seen the developers are very active with the community and love hearing feedback so if you ever encounter problems let them know and they will get it sorted out quick. Also controller support is working fine for me with my ps3 controller using ScpToolkit. I highly recommend checking this game out especially now during this wintersale.",

            "review_text": "Ara Fell’s greatest strength can be explained best through a quote from the great Shakespeare, “Brevity is the soul of wit.”  If you’ve played any number of RPGs as of late, you’ll have noticed a common flawed logic dominating a lot of them. The idea that more, or longer is innately better. The problem is if you look at some of the best games of the genre, a lot of them are better partly because of how short and focused they are. You can beat Chrono Trigger in less than 20 hours on your first time through, and I don’t think more needs to be said about Undertale.  Ara Fell took be a grand total of 9 hours to playthrough and that is actually a massive point in it’s favor. Aside from being a respectable length for a $10 game, the developers didn’t waste time with menial side quests or filler and busy work that was there just for the sake of padding things out. There are plenty of optional quest along the way that grant rewards that make them worth it if you take the time to complete them, but it’s never a scenario where the story is somehow gated off until your complete some side mission that you may not really care about, keeping things constantly moving towards the final goal, instead of arbitrarily drawing things of the sake of a long run-time.   Another key strength is how the game is smart enough not to take itself so ludicrously seriously. Ara Fell is more comedy than it is Lord of the Rings style fantasy adventure, and a lot of that comes from the exceptionally well written characters. Your only have 4 party members for the whole run, which is good as it lets you get to know each one better as a result. They feel more like a cohesive group with their own personalities, interests and nuisances to them, all delivered through consistently funny tongue and cheek dialogue.  Not that that’s to say there’s no drama or heavy moments throughout, but their aren’t overloaded to the point of becoming mundane and are used in just the right moments to add the impact they need.  Gameplay wise, well, this is a classic turned-based RPG so you know how this goes. However, the addition of more modern features like increased maneuverability when exploring, or being able to choose which specific stat to advance for each character upon leveling up all help really help make the game feel like the appropriate mix of old-school features but modernized in just the right way.  Ara Fell may not be the 50 hour epic tale that you’d expect from a Final Fantasy, but you know what that’s fine, because it has the perfect price and length to make it exactly what I needed as the mid-year dry season befalls us.",

            "review_text": "I first played the demo of this game a decade ago... and I completely fell in love. At the time I didn't know that it was incomplete, and I was devastated when I reached the end with no more development to happen. Imagine my surprise when a random reddit post announced the completed version of Ara Fell up for sale.  I have yet to complete the game, but in the small amount of time I've been able to play, this game is truly a gem and stands out as the crème de la crème of the homebrew RPGmaker market. The game offers a colorful palette of characters and scenery, and much love went into crafting the vibrant locales. Snow drifts from the sky, rats dart around dark caverns, butterflies flutter through the shrubbery -- the sheer amount of subtle eye candy stuffed into each screen is unrivaled by any of the SNES-style RPGs this game is related to.  The battle system doesn't really offer anything new to the JRPG genre, but that's not a bad thing. There is much more than I expected to make up for it -- tiered crafting, bounty hunting, lots of miniature side quests... and a semi-open world approach that is practically foreign to the jRPG market. Yes, that's right -- early on in the game much of the world becomes immediately open for exploration, blocked only by creatures far above your current levels. Of course, some areas are blocked off due to plot reasons, but it definitely reminded by of Secret of Mana in that regard.  I should also add that the author is heavily involved in updating the game and visible to the public -- it seems like there's always a minor update going out, fixing the bugs that I have yet to encounter but likely exist (seriously, I have yet to encounter any bugs). This tells me that the author is invested and cares about the quality of his/her product.  When all is said and done, with an interesting story, lovable characters, and a beautiful world, I can't recommend Ara Fell enough. If you're looking for a quality, nostalgic RPG, Ara Fell is absolutely worth every penny of it's price.",

            "review_text": "The game is overall mild, nice and addictive. Gives you a good day worth of playing, so I'll recommend it.  Pros: Yer olde DOS/console 3/4 projection 2D JRPG-style dungeon crawler. Excellent diversity of GFX, overworld really looks vivid. Interesting world, with number of small things to discover. Likable characters and fine dialogues.  Well-written linear plot. Playable with just one hand at keyboard. Easy enough even for beginners.  Cons: Shallow ending. Scaling. Bilinear really sucks and is an eyesore, and AdvMAME/HQ/SAI are not there. Boring and easy last dungeon battles, mostly due to small number of monster types overall. Some things like last dungeon trashmobs look out of style. Too small a map.",

Everyone reads like real people reacting to real situations. The world is huge and beautiful and a blast to explore and the story, while it seems cliche at first, really digs into its own tropes. There's a self-aware aspect to this game's story and it plays on itself sometimes. It's really clever.  Anyway, I love this game. It reminds me of a cross between Chrono Trigger and Zelda with better writing. Highly recommended.",

            "review_text": "Demos are ALWAYS awesome, but you ALMOST lost me forever.   Normally I would have skipped over this game but the preview video had me interested. Then I saw the “Download Demo” button. I am a sucker for free demos and almost always will get them.   Played the demo enough to defeat the first boss and was hooked! Liked the simple 16-bit look (because I overly dislike the high-definition look when used in simple RPGs). Liked the sassy and feisty main character and the story’s smooth flow and generally could not find any good reason to hate it.   So I installed the full game and OH MY GOD—all my saved games are gone!! I was THIS CLOSE to uninstalling it and washing my hands clean forever. After I calmed myself down and thought about it for a bit I looked in my Steamapps folder and OH MY GOD—there all my lost saves where under the Ara Fell Demo folder. With sweaty hands I moved them over to the folder of the full game and OH MY GOD—yes, all my progress was there and I was right where I left off (had to first save a game in the full version so I would have a place to put them).  That was close because I have been burned out of hours of game play in the past by upgrading to the full version of games. But we weathered through it and came out happy. ;D   --/\\/\\eerkat /\\ttack--  ",

I am not able to use the up direction key which is pretty important in playing a game. So I cant give this a good review. I know a lot of people do not have this issue, but buying a game thats unplayable is frustrating. I cant be the only person having this issue. So worst case make the game to where you can change the controls.",
