            "review_text": "Very early game and overall I like the style; still needs ALOT of work.  A map would help alot because ( as far as I can tell) you keep going through the same level over and over ( which changes later I'm sure ) and finding the 'new' area is a pain in the ♥♥♥. I assume the 'new' area is a doorway with blue torches? very confusing...  If you find this game cheap I suggest buying and following it's development.",
