            "review_text": "The most appealing part of this game for me is the smooth transition between action and strategy. You can be running down a hallway and mowing down goblins, then suddenly you're inches away from a giant, sifting through your inventory and trying to decide which item is the most likely to prevent his club from crushing your skull. Do you have a sleeping potion to throw at him? Maybe this unidentified scroll can teleport you to safety? Your wand of polymorphing might turn him into something that can't wield a club...  Looting is another big part of the game that stands out for me. Almost every enemy drops something, often many somethings. My inner hoarder can't help but squeal in delight when I've finished slaughtering a battallion of gnomes and find myself standing knee-deep in daggers, various wands, and a pile of tiny outfits. You have a fair bit of inventory space, and it's surprising how fast this can fill up with scrolls, potions, books, gems, weapons, rings/amulets, armors, foods, etc. Then you have to decide what you want to identify, sell, drink, read, or keep for emergencies.   Don't get me wrong though, having hundreds of items and unlimited time to think doesn't make the game get any easier as you go further down. Enemies become stronger and spawn more quickly, until you're fighting your way through waves of liches, giants, skeletons and demons. Your stockpile of healing items, wands and scrolls can be quickly depleted if you don't plan ahead or if you just have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ luck. Beating the bosses and making it back to the top is a major accomplishment, one that you'll only experience after you have a good grasp on how things work and what the best ways to approach situations are. Even then it's still a rather rare experience, especially with the most difficult characters.  There are only a few games that I can say I've put hundreds of hours into, and I'm proud to say that this is one of them.  TL;DR - Replayability, looting, inventory-management, strategy.",

The graphics might be unappealing, but they do an excellent job of conveying what you need to know. The game covers every classic element (now including genies/gods/prayer!)  It has a unique co-op mode which I have now played many times. It can make the start of the game much easier, so if you're having trouble, find someone to play with!  I hesitate to give any game such a high rating, but I would say 9/10!",

But to call this game NetHack with graphics doesn't do it justice. The game takes a lot of the basic features of NetHack such as cursed/uncursed/blessed items, spells that are forgotten over time, and the ability to make an army of pets to fight to the death for you and adds to them or changes them in ways that make it a fresh experience. Giving too many details would ruin the fun of discovering the game's secrets but    pets that have died don't have to stay dead!     While I was initially disappointed that certain features from NetHack weren't in this game such as digging through walls or bones levels; I find that once I get started on a character I don't even think to compare the games: I am too busy enjoying this one.  Overall: 10/10 would lose entourage to green dragon at depth ~1400 again.",

            "review_text": "WazHack is a very fun Perma-Death Indie game. It can also be very frustrating. This is basically a Dungeon-based RPG. There's not much of a story line, other than to go run and get an amulet, but it's more about the gameplay than the actual story line.   You can kill whatever crosses your path, but beware of who you hit. Some of your allies that turn on you can be very powerful. You want to be very VERY careful when it comes to perma-death. A single mistake will kill your character and that will lead to you starting completely over from scratch. The save will also be gone. If you have friends that have this game, then I suggest you join them, because it will make things a lot easier. Of course, when you play with them, you will want to make sure your character is in a very safe zone, because the game continues, if at least 1 person is connected and moving.  The enemies can be very brutal. You will sometimes come across horde doors. Sometimes it just seems endless, the amount of enemies that just poor out. It's very strategic and requires a lot of patience. This game is not to be rushed, what-so-ever.  4/5",

            "review_text": "Hail Sir Ralentine, the Just knight! Today is your birthday, but you are 21 years old. You are mighty, charismatic, and healthy. You have perfect blonde hair and use a lot of gel. You've never been one to read books, but you are somehow well trained in handling swords. The pointy end goes into the squishy flesh of evil doers.  On this beautiful day, you close your eyes and say a prayer to the Big Guy in the cloud to lead you to adventure. The Big Guy has always been with you since you were born, and always tells you what you should do. For example, he might say go left or go right.  When your eyes open, you realize you don't know where you are. Some other adventurous looking types are standing around a hole in the ground. The Big Guy calls out to you by name. Everyone stares at you. He says go right; then you should go down. You are uneasy with this path, but left is so very dark. You ask your trusty dog Fido to come along. You like Fido because he growls whenever there is danger nearby. Fido has been your trusty dog for about three seconds. Somehow, this is okay.  As you head right, you notice broken egg shells around a hole not far from where you stand. Thinking this is quite odd, you approach and peer inside the hole. A ladder descends into the darkness. The Big Guy tells you this is the legendary dungeon of WazHack. He says it contains the amulet of Zaw, and he wants it, NOW. For some reason, you feel like somewhat like committing senseless acts of violence, and invading the homes of others, and robbing them. Next move?  RUN AWAY:   The Big Guy is furious at you. If you told your tale of cowardice to your dear mother, she would be deeply saddened. Thankfully, that will never happen. After you turn away, a kobold head pops out of the hole you were looking down. It waves a shiny pink stick at you. A magical missile flies at your head. *Sneak attack, critical damage.* You have died. Try again?    CLIMB DOWN:   You congratulate yourself on being a brave adventurer and following the advice of your beloved deity, the Big Guy. Your dog falls to the bottom of the ladder. It doesn't even yelp. Good dog! You reach the bottom and peer around a torch-lit hallway. The Big Guy says go left, no, no wait a second, go right.    GO LEFT:   The Big Guy said left first, and there might be something shiny to the left. The Big Guy can't always be right! What does he know? Fido follows behind you very carefully, sniffing for a place to use the bathroom. You don't sense any immediate danger as you walk. Happy that you picked a safe path, you listen to the rhythmic pattern of your boots on the floor. You walk some more, and suddenly an orange haze appears around you. The room starts to fade. You close your eyes reflexively. Your insides yank down. You feel like your stomach is going to come up through your mouth. When you open your eyes, you are in another room. A feeling of panic builds inside you. Fido is not here. Oh Fido, where are thou hiding? Silently, from across the chamber, a glowing floating sword, stained with blood, flies at you rapidly. You do not notice because you are staring at an odd sign. It reads 800 feet. That's strange! You only see two feet in the room. You smile and close your eyes to ask the Big Guy for advice about the 798 feet. He just curses and forsakes you. *The flying +3 enchanted ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Sword swings and executes a critical hit.* You have died. Try again?    GO RIGHT:   The Big Guy sees that you follow his advice. He casually mentions everyone deserves a copy of WazHack. The ramblings of your benevolent deity make no sense to you, but you continue on your quest for the amulet and eternal high score glory.    EPILOGUE:   To spare our readers from ruining the adventure, we suggest that you spin up ye old computer and tell Sir Ralentine what to do next. An adventure will indeed take place, and many more may follow.  ",

It would have been far better with A) more content, B) unique monsters, C) different names for the scrolls (and maybe a second identifier on potions) since they're lifted right out of Nethack, and D) MORE CONTENT.  I do like the side 'rooms' you can 'investigate' for monster waves. Maybe I am passing judgement way too soon since I've only made it about 300 feet in. What wikis I found didn't seem populated with content, making things seem sparse.  Had this been a 'standard' dungeon crawl game and not such an obvious overglorified nod to Nethack (right down to water nymphs and fountains), I'd probably enjoy it more. But it's a fun little diversion, so I'll keep playing. The amount of effort going into this to get the right feel shows, so that is worth something. And a 3D roguelike never hurts, it is a nice change from the pixel art of Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup and others.  $10 is... a bit steep. I'd say $5 or $6.  8/10 --- worthy of picking up, but it does Need More Content.",

It appears as a 2D game, but I think it's closer to 1 and half. The majority of the gameplay happens on levels, with ladders connecting them. Mobs can follow you up and down the ladders, no stairscumming here, but for the most part it plays like a 1D leveler. With Nethack rules.   Mostly. It's indisputable roguelike in its permadeath and its randomly generated items. It's indisputable hacklike in its choice of items, punishments for testing scrolls and potions, and there are so many elements taken directly from hack it's beyond mistakable for anything else. However, some of the most defining elements of hack are missing: prayer chiefly among them. No more turn count, no more hoping your god will uncurse that item, and no more foodless achieves. The E-Word is also unavailable, as are most of the options that were available from the # menu in hack.  But it isn't Nethack, it's Wazhack. It's added so many new things, it's got its own flavor. The cartoony graphics are fun, especially when hallucinating. The different classes are really different, even the male and female versions of a class have different playstyles. I've only been playing a short while, but it seems balanced and just the right amount of accessibility. It's hard, but I don't think it's too hard. If you play it like an action game, you will lose. If you play it like a roguelike, you'll have fun.  It's not Nethack. It's Wazhack, and that's ok.  ",

I felt pretty much as invincible as I could get as a cloth wearing Sorcerer. Even still, fighting off necromancers and their hordes of undead as well as a couple ballrogs really required me to use all of my skills. Man it got crazy... Truly epic. In the end I was so stoned and so bewildered by the game that I decided to move past this ever growing horde of enemies and try the next rooms. I ended up in a fight with something truly nasty that sucks your brains, and learnt quite quickly that having your brains sucked does far more than just making you stupid.

You may get extremely lucky and find a genie lamp on floor 1, only to find out that it's cursed and the genie inside isn't too pleased with you summoning it. No matter how many times you play it, it's always a new experience.  This game really stands out to me because of its unique take on 'turns'. Nothing moves until you do. As long as you don't perform an action, everything stays still as a statue. Every action, whether it's eating, equipping, attacking, or casting, takes up a certain number of frames, and monsters can take that many frames to act as well. It's an incredibly tense experience. Just imagine this: You're surrounded by kobolds and goblins, and you need to guess which unidentified scroll will teleport you out of there, or pacify all of the monsters, or, more likely, do nothing to help you, or even get you killed.  WazHack has put me in some pretty incredible situations, both good and bad. More than once, I've tested a wand on a monster, only for it to summon three more, or transform a rat into a troll, or something to that effect. On the flip side, I've had runs where I found incredible items (like a ring of invisibility, an amulet of life saving, or wands of death) early on and had a fantastic time destroying everything... only for a wildly ricocheting magic bolt to end me. This game is all about the stupid deaths, and learning from your mistakes, and planning for the unknown so that you may find the elusive Amulet of Zaw and emerge from the dungeons victorious.",

Try your luck with a mysterious potion, of drinking from a (hopefully) refreshing fountain!  Wazhack has quaint charm in that your characters get a pet as a companion. This turns out to quite helpful, and personally kept me company as my character entered more and more dangerous levels.  You learn as you go - challenging but fun. If you find that this style of play is something you enjoy, it has good replay value.  Overall rating: 7/10",
