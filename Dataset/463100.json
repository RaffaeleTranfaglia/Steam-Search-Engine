And I know you may feel like that's not a lot, but you tell that to other ♥♥♥♥ victims and see their reaction.  In conclusion, if even just half of my sight and hearing ever restored after this epileptic beep-fest, I would call it a success.  On a scale of 1-10, I would give this game cancer, 9000 37mm bullets, 3 torpedoes and two Apache Hellfire missiles.",
