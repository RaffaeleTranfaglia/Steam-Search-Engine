The game mechanics are really interesting, the story is good, though it's going to be corny as hell in a couple years (well, it kind of is already, but even worse in the future) but the math and logic is really fun!  Sudoku: The RPGMaker game.  7/10   DO NOT have your sound blasting (there's no main menu option to control volume, so you have to do it from your comp, but I found it cute it enough to leave the sound on) and DO start on easy before trying the harder levels (humbly work your way up!!) Also do get if you love sudoku and mastermind/logic puzzle games, but you can definitely skip this if you're looking for a traditional RPG Maker. Also enjoyed having Marco from One Piece / Butters from South Park as main character. A+",

It's a creative use of the RPGMaker XP engine and with a little polish may even be able to sell for 79 cents. :)  My favorite thing in the game (which is missing in most games) is the availablity to skip the dialog that you've seen 500 times (because you keep dying). I just recommend you give a way to skip the end credits.  Also, if you could add steam achievements, this would be the best .59 cent game I've ever bought.  8/10",

            "review_text": "This game is based on RPG Maker xp. So, don't expect any wow factor visually. The game has a story but it's really not worth paying attention to. There are a few different styles of puzzles in the game but most of them don't even take much thought. The only puzzle I found truly difficult was the final cup/stone mini-game. As soon as I got a pencil and pad, I made really quick work of it. The 3x3 grid at the beginning was very easy, the chrystals were something that prince of persia would pick fun at, and adding the guy chasing you just didn't make any sense. Somehow everythings cool when you beat the bad guys after they attack you, and say 'send him to hell' I just thought that was funny.  If you buy this game, I'm sorry for your loss. I got this game in a pack of 10 for something like $2 and still think it should be free. Honestly it seems like a school project and shouldn't be sold on here. You will get some entertainment out of it, but if your like me, 1 play through should be more than enough. (I did 2 because of the review... waiste of my time) If this game were $0.05 I would say maybe if your young and cant play TF2, otherwise... no",
