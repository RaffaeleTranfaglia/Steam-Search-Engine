THIS GAME IS HILARIOUS!!!! I have been let down by alot of my VR experiences thus far(ive had my vive for about a month)  BUt this ganme is worth the money , and then some. NOTE TO DEVS AROUND TH WORLD-THIS IS WHAT PEOPLE WANT FROM VR.  Its FUN its challenging its hilarious. Great solo or with co-op. The best way to show VR to friends . YOu will be fighting over who gets to cook, and who gets to wait tables!!  The soundtrack!!! Its a gem",

Other games are super interesting for 30 minutes, but this is not a tech demo, this is actually really fun, and challenging when the big orders start coming in. If you have someone to play with dont even question buying this game, if you dont have someone to play with, it is still super fun",
