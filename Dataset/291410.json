            "review_text": " Duelyst  is a perfect mix between CCG and chess and probably  one of the best strategy games I have ever played . You should definitely give it a shot If you like games like  Hearthstone ,  Final Fantasy Tactics ,  Fire Emblem , or  Advance Wars .  It's  EXTREMELY F2P-friendly . It turns out to be  really rewarding  since you get gold for pretty much everything. One good thing about it is that a very basic deck can get you started and boost you to the top of the ladder, as  skill plays a bigger role than having good cards .  In Duelyst you play on a board where you place creatures. In order to win, you need to kill your opponent's general while keeping yours alive.  When playing this game you need to be smart, positioning is very important and it can win or lose you games. There are many ways to outplay your opponent and trust me, it feels darn good.  The game lets you  choose amongst 6 different Factions  (or classes if you come from Hearthstone) which cover every archetype, and each faction has 2 different Generals (or hero powers in HS).  It takes 5~10 games to actually understand how the game works, so I would suggest to read a bit about the game to learn the basics. Reddit is a good learning source where you can find some guides. I specially recommend watching the   Kibler's  and  Mogwai's  videos  that you can find here:   Reddit guides   There are 4 game modes:    Practice , where you can unlock the basic cards of each faction and get to know them.    Ranked , where you can play against other players. There isn't a casual mode, but it's worth noting that once you reach a new tier (Silver, Gold, Diamond and S-Rank), you can't drop your rank and you get rewards at the end of the season, so it's worth it.    Challenges , which are kind of puzzles where you need to defeat the enemy general in one turn. They are very helpful to learn the different mechanics and they give gold. I totally recommend doing them if you are a new player.    Gauntlet , or draft mode. Similar to Hearthstone's arena.   If you enjoy strategy games Duelyst will most likely hook you for a while. I totally recommend trying it atleast. Besides,  the art and the OST is freaking amazing .   By the way!  If you are a new player maybe you want to use a referral code to  get 100 gold for free . You can use it either when signing up, in your friend list or in the settings,  BUT YOU NEED TO USE IT BEFORE PLAYING YOUR FIRST RANKED GAME .  My referral code is   'drakkenuvz'  . I mean, you get 100g and I get a Spirit Orb (card pack) if you reach Silver division. Sounds fair, right?   Enjoy the game!  ",

            "review_text": "A great game overall. Ive played many turn-based games in my time, and i never liked any of them. I remember a while back me and my friend where looking for F2P games on steam, i saw this, and i just kinda glossed over it, saying 'Oh, its a turn based game'. Later, i found the trailer for Duelyst on youtube, and decided to give it a try. I DO NOT REGRET IT! The game has incredible, and i mean INCREDIBLE pixel art, a great story, and beutiful arenas. However, its not perfect, so ill do some pro and con listing:  Pros:  1: Fun  2: Beutiful  3: Immersive  4: Great game to practice strategy  5: Vetruvian  6: Fun deck-making  7: abyssian Cons:  1: Songhai  2: Bad matchmaking  3: Has a relativley steep learning curve, if you havent played many Turned based games  4: Chest keys can only be purchased through real currency  5: Gold is hard to earn  6: Sometimes spirit orbs can really screw you over  7: Decimus",

            "review_text": "I've been playing this game for quite some time. I like it and recommend it to anyone who enjoys card games.  WARNING: I will compare Duelyst with Hearthstone quite a bit. The reason, is because it has some key similarites to Hearthstone but there are a few things, that in my opinion, make this game slightly better.  Compared with Hearthstone:  - Importance of proper positioning. I know Hearthstone has positioning as well but having a board makes positioning even more important. - Better access for F2P players. I'm sorry but my biggest issue with Hearthstone is that you have to WIN games to complete your daily quests. Duelyst only requires you to PLAY games. They give you slightly less gold but it is still worth it. I've earned a lot of free booster packs just completing daily quests. - Better first turns. In my opinion, Hearthstones first few turns can be slow. Duelyst generally starts off with interesting situations and it feels like the game actually starts when you start playing. - Better disenchanting rates. Last I checked, it only takes 4 commons to craft a new common. In Hearthstone I think it takes 8.  Other pros that have nothing to do with Hearthstone:  - Great little pixel art animations. Really, if you enjoy pixel art you might give this game a go just to enjoy the pixel art for a few games. - Fun daily challenges. - Great faction variety. - Lovely character concept art.  Cons: - No unranked mode. When you play other people (outside of friend battles and gauntlet) it is always ranked. - Crate system. I guess I don't mind getting their loot crates but at least let me remove the stupid notifications about them. Or let me delete them.  There are my thoughts. Honestly, I'm rather addicted to this game. It has been one of the funnest games for me to play in my down-time and I enjoy the fact that I get a new challenge every game, and can play without having to dedicate hours and hours of my time to get anything out of it. 20-30 minutes can give you a couple decent games.

While this may look like a hearthstone clone, it is actually much, much more. Duelyst is an incredible, gorgeous, well polished, competitive strategic board game based on card decks.  Mastering this game is a real challenge since unlike other card games, this one requires good planning, positioning, complex strategies and an experienced knowledge of hundreds of difficult game mechanics.  Compared to hearthstone you gain way more good cards from packs which helps you creating a good budget deck pretty early in the game, legendaries are also way more common than HS, in other words less pay 2 win. You can also put the same card 3 times in the same deck (while in hearthstone you can only put 2 copies) and you can switch a card from your hand to your deck every turn. All of this makes the game waaaay less luck based than hearthstone.  Have fun :)",

            "review_text": "Duelyst is a tactical turn-based collectable card game with beautiful pixel art. It perfectly mixes the correct elements of different genres to make each and every game is different. Duelyst will keep you engaged and addicted after hundreds of hours. It is really easy to learn, but extremely hard to master.  Duelyst is heavily focused on player verses player combat, using six different factions; each with there own unique keywords and abilities to stomp your opponents to victory.  You can start off by crafting your deck and practicing against different faction AI's as well as completing a ton of challenges in order to learn the ins and outs of the game until you feel comfortable enough to join the ladder queue with 40 tactical cards of your choice. As of right now, there is only a ranked queue however the kind and active devs have hinted towards an unranked queue once the community has grown larger.  However if you are looking to play a raw, bare boned game, then you can enter the gauntlet. The Gauntlet lets you choose 1 out of 3 cards randomly given to you until you have a complete 30 card deck. Gauntlet allows for amazing combos and unique gameplay situations that leaves you with a feeling of satisfaction if you win 12/0 in a gauntlet run, or even a 0/3 gauntlet run.   Duelyst has a EXTREMELY nice community that loves to interact with each other through discord, twitch, twitter and other media outlets. Tournaments are constantly being organized and supported by the developers and community members hand and hand. I have never seen a dev team so connected that they willingly have one on one chats with the members.  I was accepted into the beta of this game in June of 2015. I hated turn-based games and I REALLY hated collectable card games. However, I promise you. You will not be disappointed with this game. If you see this game as 'another bad Heartstone clone,' I challenge you to play 3 games and tell me that this is a bad tactical game.   Not only is the gameplay amazing, but Duelyst has the most beautiful pixel art you have ever seen. Some people may see this as a negative, but some people are stupid and wrong.  Protip: Craft 3 Dancing Blades, 3 Primus Fists, and 3 Blaze Hounds to start your collection, and don’t disenchant anything. Build a collection, don’t try to specialize right away! ",

This is however either pay-to-win or played-long-time-to-win, have had my fair share of those type of card games. Enough is Enough. They say any decks even non-legendary can win, but when you go down below rank 10, ppl will push out Unique &gt; Legendary card each turn, some of them makes you lose on the spot unless you got equal strong cards. For example 'Summon 4 eggs on random locations' &gt; which spawns 6/6 Lizzard Hero, who in turns produce more 6/6 heroes. On turn 7, you will now face 8x 6/6 Lizzards producing even more.. Lost 3 games in a row simply not having an instant-counter (or even having a counter in my whole deck, since disable guy is melee range, and no offensive spells).   Game is ok in itself, but getting 1-2 legendary cards per Month, vs ppl playing them each turn? Enough of this already.",

            "review_text": "What to say about Duelyst. I have been playing for 7 months now and it still excites and entertains. The game is a CCG not unlike hearthstone, but the tactical element of the board makes it so much more interesting. If you are a fan of tactics games or card games it's definitely worth checking out.  Card acquisition in these game is really quite reasonable. You get gold for doing quests, most of which ask you to play with a faction for 4 games or to kill x enemy units/do x damage. There are also daily challenges for 5 gold, and if you ever miss your quests they give a small amount of the gold into a welcome back quest to make up for it. If you do all your quests, you can easily open a pack a day for about 30-40 minutes of playing. The rarities of the cards in the pack are also pretty good with a legendary card in about 1 in 4 packs. Finally, once you know the game well you can do the gauntlet, a draft mode, and so long as you get 7 wins you can go infinite for tons of rewards.  The devs are a small team that are very dedicated to their game and to the community. They push out an update with 4 new cards at the end of every month and they are constantly adding new things like cosmetics. They are supporting player run tournaments which can then feed in to their qualifiers for the Duelyst world championship. As for the relation with the community, they have done multiple rountables with popular streamers and prominent members of the community have been made into cards in the game.  All in all Duelyst is one of the best CCGs out there. Whether you are looking for a fun card game to play in between classes or looking to compete with the best in weekly tournaments there is a place for you here. If you are looking for community interaction, the subreddit and the discord channel are where most people go and the devs are requlars in the discord channel as well.   Here's hoping I see you on the battlefield.",

This has some awesome mechanics and the overall style is very cool. The single player challenges get you used most of them and are fun figuring out.  The Community isn't toxic and you never have trouble finding games. Lots of cards each faction has it's own playstyle and the graphics are beutiful.  I do think the mystery crates are a tad expensive but what free game has cheap cosmetic stuff yep none I can think off haha.  One last thing it works fine on browser so it is my go to game when I am on breaks n stuff. give it a go.

You can play 5+ hours straight without getting any new cards. Pretty frustrating to not progress in a game after 5 hours, right?  They do have a quest system where you can earn 50-70 gold a day and a larger reward for 15 quests, but that makes the game something you only want to play a couple times a day.

You can even custom make your own deck once you get to know the mechanics of the game. I would suggest this for anyone familer with table top games as its a pretty similer concept.

            "review_text": "Pretty good card game.  The general metastrucuture is similar to Hearthstone in the way it is set up (type of ranking ladder, arena, monthly seasons, crafting instead of trading, etc).  The game itself is a nice blend of basic card game mechanics and basic tactical mechanics. It actually flows really well and allows for skill to play a pretty big role. Some mechanics really help smooth the game out, like a free card cycling every turn.  The Free-to-Play model is probably the most friendly one I've seem in a CCG. It feels like they make most of their money by selling cosmetics (card backs, player icons, emotes) instead of selling cards themselves. Quite doable to play this without spending anything.",

The learning curve is not that steep, after the tutorial I pretty much played about 3 practice games to learn a deck, then a few solo challenges to learn other aspects of the game like unit abilities, spells, buffs, and debuffs. After that I felt confident enough to dive right into ranked to play other people. The ingame visuals took me by surprise as your generals/minions/spells are all fully animated in gorgeous pixelated art. As a F2P it is forgiving to the player as you can earn a lot of the card packs and other in game content just by playing. As for what I think could be improved, it could use a difficulty setting in practicing against the computer. If I'm trying to build the perfect deck to play in ranked I would want harder AI to experiment on. Also it could use an ingame chat so you could talk to your opponent as all you can do right now is use emotes or phrases. But looking at how well recieved this title has been so far, I wouldn't be surprised if it rivals other up and coming card games like Elder Scrolls Legends or Gwent.",

I will say this about the strategy of the game though. You can't sideboard cards in.

            "review_text": "Before I start, I'd like to say that I play a lot of TCGs, some of them work well on PC (as opposed to physical cards IRL), some don't...so far I've only ever played ONE other TCG that was designed specifically for PC (i.e. that wouldn't work as an IRL card game) that I really enjoyed, in its current state this game is exctremely good but without playing it for longer I'm unsure as to whether or not it'll get boring after extended play. Now for the actual Review: Duelyst is an excellent TCG-style strategy game which, unlike many other free-to-play games in this genre manages to handle microtransactions in a fair way. While there's a lot of cosmetic items such as emotes and re-skins available exclusively for cash, none of these give an advantage within the game. Card packs are available for cash but are simply a way to obtain cards slightly faster than through normal gameplay (and they're priced a little outside of the range of people with a 'I'll just buy 1000 packs to get every card' mentallity), how quickly you can earn card packs through gameplay is dependant on how well you play, whether or not you decide to clear the single-player 'puzzle' challenges, etc. Though you should be able to earn 2-4 packs per day if you play for 1-2 hours. after 2 hours of play I had enough 'spare' cards to sell and buy any common or semi-common card I wanted.  The game has a focus on player-vs-player matches as opposed to single player vs the AI (though this IS still an option), The matches are very strategic, though the escalating stats of higher-cost cards makes lower-cost cards near-useless after just a few turns, which makes matches more and more luck-based the longer they play out. Cards are split into 3 types: essentially these traditional TCG cards: units, equipment and spells.  Matches take place on a grid, players summon units onto spaces within range of their hero or other units, each turn each unti may move up to 2 spaces and then attack an adjacent enemy. Equipment cards boost your hero in various ways, but have durabillity which is lost when your hero takes damage. Spell cards have various effects which directly affect the match, units, equipment, etc.  Good bits:   An retro graphical style with good animations and varied card designs.   Not pay-to-win.   Balanced starter decks and factions with unique strategies that give advantages to people that can plan and strategise as opposed to people with 'better' cards.  Bad bits:   High-cost cards tend to be exponentially stronger than low-cost ones, making long matches lean in favor of whoever gets luckiest in drawing their highest cost cards.   The cosmetic items in the cash shop are absurdly expensive for what they are.   No 'story' mode currently (the cards are filled with lore which seems wasted without a storyline to go with it)   Overall 7/10 in its current state. Worth trying but many people will be put off by the lack of true single-player experience.",

For any friends that try it: BEFORE YOU DO A LADDER MATCH USE THE CODE 'lugarugan' for +100g and added to my list of referrals. This will afford you a spirit orb or part of a gauntlet run based on what you spend it on ingame. Oh, and gold is more common than in hearthstone. That's a plus.  I repeat, do it BEFORE a ladder match. The moment you've gotten into your first ladder match, it is too late to use referral codes. Settings &gt; Code redemption or whatever &gt; input just 'lugarugan' as that is my Duelyst nickname. Even if you input my name on sign-up or whatever, you will likely need to do this to be considered one in the system it uses.  Note: I also gain 1 spirit orb and 200 gold if you reach silver and gold divisions respectively. I can tip you after friendly matches if I have spare gold I believe though, as on average I'll be affording 1 gauntlet run a day. So in a way, I can give you some of that 200g in return if you get that far based on how many matches we play and such.  However I will not start tipping gold until I am gaining more rewards per run on average than I'd get from just buying orbs. Since only one win gives me an orb and Spirit, I'm already dropping buying orbs on their own entirely, as this will also let me learn about new cards as I earn the orbs. And maybe I'll even get enough Spirit to craft some of the cards I learn about on the way!   I do recommend you try the mode after reaching Silver and trying a few decks with your current cards beforehand. As learning some of the cards you get before you start trying it will go a long way in learning if they are good to pick during runs. Gauntlet deckss are made of 30 cards plus one general, picked from sets of 3 cards. You also pick your faction from a set of 3 of the 6 factions, so you won't always get your favorite faction.

No, i think you can try it out, this game have 'something' who make you play it again and again even if somethimes really ♥♥♥♥ you off.  So, try you too! :D",

Though instead you play on a grid based board, moving and positioning your creatures and generals to make some amazing plays. There is a lot of depth for players who like to make crazy synergy decks and board control.   It's pretty balanced from my experience in terms of P2W, you can earn gold in game easily enough to buy cards. The game is free and deff worth playing.",

The tactical grid is nice, it allows for positioning to come into play, and increases the skill beyond just drawing and playing the right cards. Many good players have in fact reached high ranks playing supposedly weak factions or decks just because they are skilled at the game, so while there are always some slight imbalances, all factions are represented at high levels (and at lower levels too).  Card acquisition is a lot more generous than Hearthstone, you get gold pretty easily from doing daily quests, enough to easily buy a pack of cards every day. The base set also has a fairly high legendary drop rate, although they tuned this down a bit in the expansion.  The art style is an acquired taste, the pixel art is great, but the mixture of arts styles is a bit odd. You get used to it.  For me, this is the best online CCG I have tried by far, and it's free, so I would highly recommend giving it a go.",

Edit: Played for longer and now I'm facing veteran players with custom decks when playing with starting decks, where people have cards with 2x more value than mine. I could summon 2 or 3 mana 2/3s with an effect, but the enemy has 0/6 2 mana totems that summon a 2/2 monster every turn or 2 mana 2/2 Pax that on death summon 2 2/2 dervishes for a total of 6/6 value as THREE monsters against my (typically) low hp monsters (best probably fenrir warmaster for 6/4 value. Dispels do not have enough value to counter these kind of rush type minions especially when combined with buffed ranged minions because they use all the starting mana, a card from your action bar AND still leave the enemy minions with their original attack/hp values - giving no draw to keep up (and then you have to deal with distance of the ranged enemies or find a dispel for them as well). These are just some examples.  The game snowballs too easily and constructed requires heavy RNG in getting to choose cards that synergize and fit the meta. because of requiring a lot of grind to be able to fight against custom high value decks and a lot of rng to do well in constructed, I don't recommend playing more than up to level 11 casually on each class.",

Then I noticed in the update 2 of the new cards addressed exactly what I was complaining about. So Id say they are definitely monitoring the game. Worth it to try but becareful about spending money.  October 17th update was spot on....fixed exactly the balance issues I was griping about. Well done guys and girls.  I gotta say I rarely go back to a game after a negative feeling but the devs here saw the flaws and corrected them.",

Don't really like having to write out full reviews when recommending a game that I like and want to succeed, so I'll just jot down some bullet points.  -6 faction decks to choose from. Each with different playstyles / approaches. So lots of card variety  -- currently  the game boasts over 400 cards, so thats about 60 cards per faction, and a very large Nuetral card faction (cards that can augment any deck) consisting of close to 200 cards. That is a really nice start for a new game of this type. -each faction has two unique Generals (one included and one unlockable) that are available to you each with a different special ability. You start with your general on your side of the map and can move him about, summoning minions and taking actions, attacking, etc. But it also holds your HP so play accordingly.  -Ranking system in place -Factions level up as you play to unlock more from their decks -card crafting -good amount of daily quests (4iirc), and the option to replace the ones you don't wish to fulfill --oh and good quest  variety ; deal X dmg in a game, kill X amount of creeps, etc. instead of just 'Play as X faction'",

If you have played Hearthstone at all you will instantly see the influence of the game. The booster packs cost the same, the draft mode cost the same. You get daily quest, and completing them will give you gold.   The Mage Wars portion comes in the checker board combat where you and your creatures are physically represented in the world and requires a whole new layer of strategy that Hearthstone does not offer, given that you can move your avatar in and out of combat, block off impending attacks with a wall of your own creatures, and need to be aware of what's on the field, what can potentially make it to you, and where you may need to go.   How does it go for someone who doesn't pay? I don't pay, I ranked up to 18 in the Silver league last night. While not super impressive, I haven't spent a dollar on the game. Simply grinding out gold on the Solo quests offered, which provide you a scenario and challenge you to kill the opponent in one turn ala Magic the Gatherings video game iterations, and from doing the daily quests that I was offered. The booster packs have been more than enough to supplement my deck nicely and I find the game quite enjoyable.   The long term con I can see to this game is of course, what else can they do with it? The draft mode is fun, but I'm not going to pay for gold, which means I can only draft when I grind out the required 150. Hearthstone got to the point where I was only logging on to play the Brawl mode because they were fun and offered unique games that were quite memorable. Once you complete the Solo portion, which I haven't yet, where does it go from there? Will you continully have to beat your head against ladder play, hoping to slowly grind out gold till you can buy your next booster pack? If so I could very easily see a lull coming in the game for my future. Despite these reservations, I have still enjoyed the game, for the little time that I've been playing.  All in all, this is a fantastic game, that requires a both a head for strategy, deck building, and card playing. My only concern, where does it go from here?  ",
