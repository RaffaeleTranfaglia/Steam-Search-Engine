            "review_text": "Winter Voices is an indie text heavy RPG a bit akin to Planescape: Torment, but also very different. Its strongest point is its fairly linear psychological and existential story centred on some of the darker aspects of us humans, but ultimately it's an experience of struggle, development, hope and growth; made with psychological insight. Next its 'combat' encounters and its weakest the free roam hub-sections like the starting village. The game has a lovely artistic vision and ambience created by its hand-in-hand art direction, soundscape and writing. Which all have a wonderful poetic feel and are tied into the 'combat system' beautifully. Plus if you are fond of metaphorical writing in works like 'Thus Spoke Zarathustra' by Nietzsche, then you're bound to find the dream sequences interesting, as they employ metaphors to great effect. That said the English translation can be a bit iffy, so play it in its native French if you can.   The game is set in a fictional universe at the start of an industrial revolution in a Western country. The plot unfolds in a little remote, primitive and snowy mountain village, which lives by and practices a variant of Old Norse religion, whether the game is set in a Fantasy setting, or employs Magical Realism is up to interpretation, though it isn't at the core of the narrative outside of the dreams. You play a young and fragile twenty-four year old woman whose father has just died, it fairly quickly becomes apparent that you, the protagonist, have an abnormally hard time dealing with this death (wink wink), which propels you onwards on a journey of self-discovery within your dreams and the real world.   RPG mechanics  There are three classes to pick from Huntress, Weaver and Völva (a shamanic seeress). All of which favours one the six stats (Humour, Willpower, Memory, Perspicacity, Charisma and Intuition). These stats represents your strengths and weakness in your psychological profile. You get, primarily, XP points to level them up from completing quest, 'combat' and speaking with people. Separate from this you also gets Skill Points as you level up. You can use them in a giant 2D-snowflake-formed Skill Tree with a total of 90ish skills to choose from enveloped by twelve different main paths (Negation, Metamorph , Pride, Social, Support, Composition, Ex-nihilo, Acceptance, Resilience, Resistance, Protection and Dispersion. ) to pursue, as you start out in the centre of it. You won't be able to learn all the skills in one play-through. Each of the twelve paths represents different ways, more or less gamey centred, human beings can deal, reflective or not, with grief and loss, whereas the 'sub skills' are mixed between human traits such as creativity, perfectionism etc., and more culture specific things on the other hand such as: Song: Voluspa and Void Walker.   'Combat' encounters. The combat encounters take place in the dreams of our protagonist. Troubled dreams that portrays her struggles to come to terms with her father's death and her past. They are turn-based puzzle-like encounters on a grid that represents her fight with her inner demons. Overall I found the combat encounters interesting and varied enough in their different puzzles in my play-through as a Völva. Though an occasional freezing bug of the entire game was annoying in some of the longer key encounters, especially as you couldn't save in between them.  In fact it made me put the game aside for around a year before returning to it once again. Though I am glad I did, as I really, really loved certain parts of the narrative :D",

            "review_text": "Pro: - Art, sound and atmosphere are great. - The 'combat'-system is quite original – weird, but enjoyable after you got into it. - The story is nice, but a bit overstretched for my taste.  Con: - This game lacks balancing, bug fixing and suffers from clunky controls. - Somewhat slow movement  When the negative aspects made me dump this game the first time, the awesome atmosphere made me come back. Then I resigned a second time due to some annoying bugs. Now half a year is gone, and I still wonder whether I should give it another try. That means something since normally I don't even give games a second chance. But the atmosphere ... it just hooked me. So I recommend this game for the experience, but be warned of all the frustration that's waiting for you.",

If you like grid, turn based battle systems, this has you covered. Mystery, yeah its got that too. Do you like to read? It has lots of text for good reason though. Have you ever wondered what fighting with your inner thoughts and feelings would look like? This does it in a way like no other could.   Play the demo, if you like what you see, buy the first episode. Even if you don't like it, it would only be a few bucks you would be out. Alternatively, you might just buy the rest.",

            "review_text": "I'm a bit of a masochist in that I'll try a game even if it's broken as long as it has a few redeeming points; Winter Voices does have a great story, but right off the bat I found it better to play in French since the dialogue was written in that language, and it just flows better that way. The English translation unfortunately suffers from many 'bugs' (translations that don't flow well and don't always make sense). The voice narration also doesn't quite correspond to the written text (the voicing dialogue is better), which was enough to bug me by itself; I wish there was a way to hide the text completely in some instances.  I'd seen on the developers' website that they planned/plan to provide a fully bugfixed version... I don't know if that's still happening given the state of their team, but I recommend waiting until that happens, or at least that you be prepared to save your game every 5 possible minutes in case the interface stops responding in any useful way (or you get stuck in a dialogue after the interface has already disappeared.) It feels as though devs skimped on having too many state checks to allow/disallow clicking, and the way I naturally interact with the interface just interrupts the game and forces me to reload too often.   Beware, this also happens in places where narration immediately precedes a fight, removing any option to save. If the interface bugs out during those, you'll spend long minutes getting back to where you were if you die / try again. This is made worse in spots where 3, 4 battles are chained. There's no relief for me as this happened in every episode.  Pathfinding also has issues where your teammates block the way out of a screen, and there's no way to control them or get them out of the way (you have to reload a previous save).  Don't look for many keyboard shortcuts, this is a 97% mouse-driven experience, although it feels like the keyboard was forgotten rather than purposefully omitted.  And finally, don't expect to have story options that lead you out of the main character's comfort zone, unlike many modern RPGs the point is not to cater to the player's tastes and provide many options, but really to tell a specific story.  I have lots of spare time and am curious enough to play through the entire thing (on ep. 5 now), as I found the story captivating enough for that even despite the issues, but technical issues really are that frustrating throughout. I hope this gets fixed so I can update my review!",

            "review_text": "Generally speaking, I feel like this game misses the mark. The writing is deeply irritating and pretentious nonsense, which is fine. I'd be happy to suffer through a little irritation if the 'game' parts of Winter Voices weren't just as deeply irritating. Simply put, the 'combat' is terrible.  Firstly, it would be inaccurate to call this combat. It technically is a tactical RPG combat system, but what you're doing isn't fighting so much as avoiding damage for an arbitrary number of turns (one of the popular 'win' conditions is Last 10 Turns) or reaching a certain tile on the tactical grid. When I read about it, it impressed me as a novel way of representing the game's protagonist dealing with nightmares and emotions and such, and it is, but the implementation is clunky and amateurish in the extreme.  The art's very attractive, the setting is intriguing, the UI is effective (as you can tell from the screenshots) and while I personally find the faux-Proustian pretentiousness of the writing insufferable, it's entirely possible that it gets less so in the later episodes, but the combat system drags it all down into the mud of disappointment and unplayability. I feel like this would've worked better as a more traditional story-driven adventure or even visual novel-type experience than trying to cram it into tactical RPG shoes.",

These and other bugs happened on a nearly minute-by-minute basis. This is the level of quality you'd expect from a PRE-alpha build.  Even if you can get past the constant storm of bugs, there isn't much here. All missions are either 'Get to this location,' or 'Survive for n turns.'  TL;DR, save your money.",
