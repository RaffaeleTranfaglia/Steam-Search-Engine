            "review_text": "If you dont mind reading then this is a great game. Your decisions matter and the content seems cannon from what I have seen. The game's combat is unique but you should have guessed.   Most of this game is reading but it is awesome, I hate reading normally but the reading in the game is easy and simple. It explains everything so that someone with no time in the Warhammer universe can understand what is going on while if you do know you get tingles down your spine as you try to guess what happens next.  DO NOT buy this game for combat, it is stiff. The main draw for this game is the choices you make during the text portions.  This game is an easy read and the choices you make will leave you realing with excitement.",

            "review_text": "Played it and loved it, the amount of different ways to achieve (or fail~) your various objectives really keeps things interesting, the story is well put together and the combat while turn based is still tense with emphasis on the timing of your retreat, advance, melee and ranged attacks. kept me busy for a little bit 100% but every bit was worth it. You won't find a much better way to spend your ten bucks",
