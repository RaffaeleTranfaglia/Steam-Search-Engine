We've played all the levels multiple times to get the different costumes &amp; to upgrade our weapons to see what we would get next to slap around the baddies. This is a great game to play with your kids, challanging enough to get you thinking yet easy to pick up &amp; learn. Definitely a wishlist item for any parent with young kids, hours of fun.",
