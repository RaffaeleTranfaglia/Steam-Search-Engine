The graphics, controls and interface are ok, but I wouldn't recommend the game itself: all you have to do is drag an endless number of lines and loops to guide the rovers. And the 'soundtrack' (if one could name it as such) is repetitive, even annoying.  So, unless you miss playing on your tablet, find something else.",
