            "review_text": "WFfF is definitely a budget game, it feels like a flash game, and the combat and dialogue mechanics are shallow but ultimately it has enough charm to be worth playing. It helps that they are different ways to approach things and different endings as well. If the devs had more to work with this could have been real good, but as it is its a solid game worth the price.",

Steam Trading cards are a good addition and were what lured me into this game, the humor however kept me playing through to grab those achievements.  Achievements take a few playthroughs to get (alternative endings etc), but once you can look past this and the slightly clumsy feeling controls it is a fun short game. The humor of the game text is good for a cheap laugh though it might be more at home on a flash games website than as a standalone product on Steam. Developer is nice enough to drop some helpful info in the Discussion/forums on the Community Hub but it would be better to have those fitted into the game.  In short; a good game to grab if you need another 100% achievements completed item on your profile, earn a few trading cards or for a short game between other activies on your PC.",

            "review_text": "I was given a key from the developer and couldn’t play more than 5 minutes at a time (only played twice) before getting bored or irritated. My time in game is grossly exaggerated because I left it open at menu when I stepped away from the computer to nap instead.  TL;DR - This game is a waste of your time, money, and disk space.  The game is equipped with a detailed conversation system that I didn’t care much for in terms of wasting my time with pointless back-and-forth banter. I understand dialogue in games, especially RPGs or choose-your-own-adventure games, but if the game advertises a nonlinear plot to begin with, what’s the point?  The mechanics of the game are that of a basic side-scroller, beat-em-up, button masher with simple controls and equally simple animations. The fighting animations are about as dynamic as an early-2000s Flash game, and in my opinion, the lack of variety or ability to chain combos exponentially detracts from the initial allure to beat up NPCs. Plus, being restricted to walking across the screen and beating people up as you go gets old real fast.  The writing and humor were also a bit lackluster. Part of me also thinks the dialogue merely exists for the pure gratification of beating NPCs up in lieu of sitting through lengthy conversations that are often not even necessary to incite in the first place. The highlighted “ridiculously complicated conversation system” is primarily what turned me off from wanting to complete this game.  In the end,  Will Fight for Food  is the type of game meant for quick doses of mindlessly simple gameplay and flat, offbeat humor. Although to be honest, this game wouldn’t be my first choice for either; I’d rather play a better-executed free mobile game than pay money for and sit at my computer to play this.",
