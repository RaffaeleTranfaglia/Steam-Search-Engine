Cant wait for steam to implement their refund system, as this game does not deliver a basic playable experience.  I cannot in good conscience recommend this game, or the developer/publisher in any way, as this is the kind of fatal flaw that shouldve been ironed out pre release, not still be in the game months after it was released, if starcraft 2 had this kind of game breaking bug, everyone wouldve dropped it like a flaming bag full of dog poo.",

            "review_text": "Etherium is an interesting Sci-Fi, Real Time Strategy game. It feels like a lot of other RTS's out there and doesn't seem to bring anything new to the table. It has a playable tutorial which makes the commands and controls easy to learn. The story in Etherium doesn't really shine through in the tutorial and seems fairly generic. It isn't a bad game, it just feels like a lot of other RTS's lately. I would have liked to see more base building in this game and felt that aspect was very limited. It didn't seem like there was a big difference between the different factions, but there were special abilities you could unlock once you expanded a colony with the technology center, and those were sort of neat.  All in all, I think the game could have been a lot better if they had some diversity with the factions, and allowed the bases to be more expandabe. The game does offer single-player campaigns for each faction, as well as Skirmish mode, and Multiplayer Mode, but there appear to be long waits for some of the Multiplayer games. Graphically speaking the game is bland. My advice, Etherium isn't a bad game, but you can probably do better.",

See, there are two parts to this game, the 'space' part (turn based), and the on-planet part (real-time). You start out in space, build your space fleet in your home planet, and you invade planets with it, sending down invasion forces down on planets. Your fleets can battle other fleets in space, and your on-planet base can be upgraded to be able to attack the enemy fleet in space.   There are two paths to victory: Either destroy the enemy on-planet (their main base) or send their fleet packing, abandoning its forces on-planet.   Graphics are not too heavy. Should run well on most PCs. Music and SFX are eh.  I suppose it is fine. Recommended, sure, but not my cup of tea.",

Although, in the game, I have noticed that the developers have not fixed the crashing problem and limmited the ammount of units you can have on the battle field, along with other limmitations. It is an excellent game, but the game no longer has anyone playing it any more. It would be better if more people would battle/play on multiplayer. I see over 800 people in the game but none of them are in multiplayer!  Although, the only thing that I suggest to the developers are these:  Increase the number of units you can have on the battle field, increase the numbers of turrets you can place in a territory, add more units, modify the building layout to allow the players to build where ever they would like (this would mean changing the entier way of how the game will be, such as location of colonies, ammount of colonies, and more), add a way to upgrade the main control center to a 'Palace,' add more structures such as walls, and a game play mode where the player/players can battle in space! :)  ",

True for the first look at Etherium, but if you stop playing right there you missed all the fun.  The true game potential develops once you get into the deeper mechanics and realized how different the factions are and what a wide load of strategies and buildorders Etherium offers. Even if the game has a strict rock-paper-scissor mechanic with hardcounters all over, there are plenty ways to win without missing possibilities to an individual playstyle.  You will see a very good programmed AI, funny but repetitive singleplayer mode, a huge variety of maps, decent balance with just some minor issues, ingame ranking system and a league system similar to SC2.  Unfortunately, the game suffers from a very common issue nowadays, a small playerbase.  Buy it if gameplay is more important to you than graphics and if you want a straightforward RTS to fill some of your freetime by playing both singleplayer and multiplayer. Otherwise, pass it.   EDIT 21/04/15:  By now the number of players has reached a point where it become very difficult to get a multiplayer game up without directly inviting a friend. And this downtrend continues. The game itself is great but at the current prize and without the possibility to play decent multiplayer matches I cannot recommend it anymore.",

            "review_text": "Fine, I recognisethe small budget outfit and the indie title. That aside, the game still remains buggy, crashing for me after each mission. So minus major points there.   Graphics-wise, I'd be impressed if this was the early 2000s, but I wouldn't complain so much. Graphics in games, well, the units in the game collectively act as a squadron, which means each unit has to be animated, and controlled, while reinforcements do come in to replenish fallen squadmates.That mechanic, quickly gets boring and, since reinforcing fallen squadmates don't take resources, it's easy to defend, tough to attack.   So what's it like? Well, Etherium is kinda like leading campaigns on a world map (galaxy map), targetting specific planets to gain territory. Unfortunately, I've only played less than 2 hours, and I fail to see the appeal here, as more planets should automatically mean more resources to bring to war but to avoid unbalanced the developer didn't put too much into it. Once you've selected a territory to attack, it enters this real-time strategy mode, where its the basic gather resources and pump units and attack. However, the battlemap is divided into areas where you control via building outposts, sort of like the WarCraft III ziggurats of the Undead, where you just expand your territory, while the enemy expands his.  On the early onset, there's some early skirmishes, where the faster units start harassing certain locations of base. However, after a while, it drags on into this sort of trench warfare with the AI, which sends units forth, your defense leave them running, and they go back to their outpost which heals and reinforces the squads, and rinse, dry and repeat.   Victory comes either by quickly overruning the opponent and sapping his resources in the early game, pulling out a technologically superior unit or taking control of one of the various neutral spawns on the map. I find myself overrunning the opponent with a mix of heavy tanks, and long range mortars.   However, because of the 'tech tree'is in the larger world map, instead of the ingame battle map, you gotta choose which tech tree to upgrade in your war against the opponent. Fine, this means that if you got rocket infantry, while the opponent chooses to upgrade only his air units, you got him beat and overrun, and it would take many turns before he will have sufficient tech points to muster a counter. This would make for some painful games.   Learning curve is steep, the game has too many mechanics to overcompensate for its lack of tactical debt, and one of my biggest annoyance is the unit voices. Storyline is uninteresting, and only meh.   4/10  4/10 with rice.",
