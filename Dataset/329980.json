            "review_text": "I first played ASA: A Space Adventure a while ago - it wasn't remastered back then, nor was it sold on Steam (if memory serves, I bought it from the developer's website). Despite having played it already, I was greatly looking forward to the Steam release - hopefully it can help this wonderful game get some more exposure.   ASA is a broadly 'Myst-like' (i.e. first person puzzle-heavy) sci-fi adventure game. If you're a fan of exploration and puzzle solving (studying notes to decipher passwords, exploring the world's nooks and crannies, discovering mysterious contraptions and figuring out their purpose, etc.), then you're bound to love ASA. The puzzles are particularly great, being both challenging  and  logical - a rare feat for any adventure game.  I'm a big fan of Myst-likes, and having played a whole lot of them, from the Myst series itself to Zork: Grand Inquisitor or the more obscure ones like Schizm or Obsidian, I can safely say that ASA's puzzles and atmosphere are among the best in this subgenre.",

            "review_text": "A pretty neat adventure game inspired by classic FPA games like Myst and RHEM. It lacks some of the polish that those games had, but still has an interesting story, beautiful environments, and some clever (albeit easy) puzzles.  Pros: +Extremely good prerendered animations and screens +Unique sci-fi story told through diaries and the environment +Very nice soundtrack +Most of the puzzles are good  Cons -Puzzles are mostly very easy... -...with the exception of one puzzle near the end which makes absolutely no sense. Even after reading a walkthrough, I still didn't understand it. (this was the only puzzle I needed a walkthrough for) -The game lacks polish; most of the animations don't 'line up' with the screens correctly, so they just suddenly cut and start which breaks immersion. -On the subject of polish, I found a prerender which contains a texture that has a very clear watermark on top of it. This kind of stuff really shouldn't slip through. -Many animations show the player character from the third person, and some of the screens are shown from camera angles that the player character clearly couldn't be standing from. This isn't a big deal, it's just one of my pet-peeves as it breaks immersion for me. If you take a look at RHEM and Myst, these games always remain in first-person and all of the prerendered stills are always taken from camera angles that make sense for the player to be standing.  Despite some of its flaws, ASA is still a great adventure game. Definitely going to be giving the sequel, Catyph, a shot after this.",
