            "review_text": "Really well done 2D platformer, very authentic to the shareware-style DOS games from the early 90s. This goes beyond simply the pixel art craze, it's spot on in art style, sound effects, color palette, gameplay, hidden areas, even the menus and episode selection.  The gameplay is immediately familiar and nostalgic for those who grew up on these games. Strongly inspired by and reminiscent of games like Commander Keen, Crystal Caves, Duke Nukem I and II, Cosmo's Cosmic Adventure, Monster Bash, etc.  Highly recommended if you enjoy the genre and have any fondness for games of that period.",

It really feels like a game made 'back in the days', but with modern thought given to it. A very pleasant game with an intriguing plot. Totally recommend it to people who like oldschool games.",

            "review_text": "MURI feels like a game designed with a purpose, and it meets that purpose well. It duplicates the appearance and structure of an EGA-era DOS platformer, and feels very authentic to that. It even has an option to scroll tile-by-tile as those games often did to compensate for the underpowered PC graphics hardware of the day.   The game consists of twenty levels divided into four episodes. Much like the games it follows, you do lose all your weapons and powerups after each, but the game is designed for this; boss fights give you massive arsenal upgrades and the first level always gives you a few extra guns if you're careful with your special ammunition.  The game's challenge level is fairly even, with a gentle upward slope as you progress. Though the game's final chapters do ramp up the enemy and bullet density, there aren't any egregious 'gotcha' spots, at least on Normal difficulty that I played.  Overall it's an average game, but one worth playing if you enjoy the EGA aesthetic. If you're a fan of Duke Nukem 1 and 2, or Commander Keen, grab this.",

'Meh why not' And then it just was there in my library, waiting... and now 2014 I played it from the start to end and I found my self eating the story line fully!   The storyline is well written, and far from too long nor too short The classic graphics is nothing to complain about as the developers made sure not to go too far with it. and 'bleep boopâ™ª' Classic sfx ingame just to die for.  I reccomend this game to any person who needs a small vacation from their Fps and just kick back and sit with a controller in your hand as you engulf your self into the story of MURI  10/10 From Lyh Flare :8bitheart:",

            "review_text": "Fun if you enjoy challenging, nostalgic games.  With all the megaman, sonic, and mario homage games out there these days it snice to play something that references back to the games *I* played in my childhood: DOS platformers. You could list out dozens of classic DOS games that Muri is like but it bares the strongest resembalence to the original Duke Nukum even to the point of having nearly identical assets at times.  Where Muri fails at its emulaiton of Duke is its lack of puzzles to progress, most levels can just be run through without fighting enemies (if you dodge their attacks) and rarely do you ever encounter anything more than a few tricky platforming sections. The Challenge of Muri comes from its unforgiving combat and sheer number of enemies. I don't particularly care for that aspect of the game so I played on an easier difficulty and just enjoyed the nostalgic gameplay.   Where Muri wins majorly is its secrets, it has TONS of hidden areas and secret items throughout the levels which allow you access to special weapons at the boss fights. If you enjoy finding secrets and racking up a high score this is the game for you.",

Nice that the dev tried to remain authentic to MURI's forerunners, though the 'authentic' 16 fps setting ended up giving me motion sickness about an episode in. Had to change it to smooth fps to resume comfortable play.  Setting up an Xbox 360 controller was really easy and the controls respond well. MURI doesn't like alt-tabbing out of full screen, so the few times I did, I needed to quit the episode to re-configure Jump to A.  Biggest drawbacks? The two problems mentioned above, plus NO MUSIC. For what it's worth, the game plays really well to the classic Mega Man soundtracks.  Only took me 90 minutes to beat on Normal, even with restarting Episode 2 twice after alt-tab shenanigans. But the multiple difficulties and high score hunting give MURI good replay value.  Overall? A good game, especially for its price.",

The game is based on those old titles and is just like the first Duke Nukem with simple EGA-like graphics, emulated PC Speaker sound and it controls great on Keyboard, you can use a gamepad but back then in the DOS age you either used a Joystick or a Keyboard with the arrow keys and ALT + STRG and the game gets this right. The Levels have a lot to offer with a ton of secret passages to discover and while it may not be a game you'd play for 10 hours, it's entertaining, offers various difficulties and doesn't cost much. 20 years ago it would've been celebrated as a masterpiece.",

            "review_text": "At first glance I thought this was just a rip off of the classic DOS platformer Duke Nukum, the similarity is mainly cosmetic. MURI has many differences that make it its own game.  First, the protagonist is a chubby Martian chick. Second, you can't save, although the episodes aren't very long so it's not a big deal. Finally, the controls don't feel nearly as solid as good ol' Duke: jumping is very weird and takes some getting used to, since you have to hold the key to reach maximum height. It feels more like a limited flight, and if MURI had a jetpack it would make sense. But I guess on Mars you can somehow jump around corners. However once you get used to it, it works pretty well.  Overall it doesn't feel nearly as sold as the original Duke Nukem, which is a little disappointing. I was expecting a hard-chiseled DOS platformer that felt like an old Apogee game. However it's not bad but in the end it just makes you want to play the old classics again.",

            "review_text": "To start: I used to add a header to these reviews, but since it often times made the reviews a bit too long, I've left it on my Backloggery page. Even though I don't think that'll be an issue for this game, I feel compelled to point that out anyways. Besides, it's worked fine so far.  Gameplay: If you've never played a DOS-style shooter before, think something like the original Contra but with more maze-y levels. If you have played a DOS-style shooter, this is pretty much par for the course. The stages are labyrinthean with plenty of secrets; some of which are pretty easy to spot while others require you to dig deeper into the level for something like a switch that activates something at the beginning of the level. I got an average of 95% of the points for each of the levels, with the exception of the boss levels, but that's just because of how the game scores points. There's four episodes which consist of five levels a piece; four stages and a boss stage. Hidden somewhere in the first four stages of each episode are items called cells which allow you to get some extra powerups before the boss of that stage. They're not essential, but they certainly do help.  Bosses in this game are actually really good; certainly a lot better than some of the bosses you'd see in the Commander Keen series. I only played through the game on Normal, but even on that difficulty they were a bit of a handful. The final boss was just plain excellent and a great way to end the game. As for the weapons, you have your standard pea shooter, a rapid shot, a five-way spread, a laser that splits and bounces off of walls, a homing explosive shot, and Chaos which just does things and kills enemies sometimes.   Apart from that, that's pretty much your lot for this game. It took me just over an hour and a half to beat the game on normal with a fair bit of exploration of the stages, but that's a pretty good length for a DOS-style game. It definitely has replay value, especially with higher difficulties and 100% playthroughs, so if you're into that kind of thing, this game will certainly be worth the $4. It's simple and compact, and there really isn't a thing Id change about it. 10/10.  Story: Unlike a lot of DOS-shooters, this game actually has a pretty good story. It's a bit hard to follow, but it's a fairly high-level Sci-FI storyline about the creation of life. Surprisingly interesting and a not half bad delivery of what could be perceived as a dramatic ending. 8/10.  Graphics: Fortunately, the game doesn't launch in CGA resolution; that would be annoying. Rather, it fullscreened to my native resolution of 1080p without a hassle, so that's all good. As for the art direction, it's quite good, even if the MURI suits look a bit like Robo-Bunnies. Apart from that, the world designs are good, the enemy designs can be absolutely fantastic, with the boss of Stage 3 being the big standout. I can't quite speak for whether or not it rigidly conforms to the EGA palette or not, but it looks DOS-y and it looks good. 5/5.  Sound: This is something that I don't think I've done in the year or so since I started reviewing games (three months since I started publishing Steam reviews): I'm not gonna rate sound. I really can't, since the game itself goes for yet another factor of the DOS design in that there is no music - save for the title track - and all of the sounds are blips. So yeah, it feels a bit weird to do that, but that's what's happening.  Overall scores are: 10/8/5/0; 9.2/10. A very solid little shooter that's well worth the money. I'll definitely play it again in the future.",
