            "review_text": "Fairly short game, one of those times where I'd neither recommend it or otherwise, but negative seems more appropriate.  Pros:  -Nice, simple design -Some challenging puzzles -Only .99 USD   Cons:  -Very short -No saves (Claims it's too short to do that) -Very repetitive music (Restarts upon level start, level restart..) -Blocks falling in front and behind the platform, even though it's a flat game (Maybe they could implement that in a BitRay2, 3d!)  Overall, an okay game for on sale / obtained in a bundle, or blowing a buck on a little challenge.",

To spice things up, some blocks have special functions that chnage the gameplay. Although it has no save feature, the game only takes about 30 minutes to complete. Quick and easy fun when bored.",

This game is a bit weird - although objects are 3D, our view is 'side' 2D, it still can go 'farther' or 'closer' to us and fall off platforms.  Music very repetetive - it starts playing every â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ level. Buggy - it says ALL whites must be on platform which is not true. Short - less than 30 minutes of gameplay. No cards. Not really much anything.",
