            "review_text": "I debated for a while whether I should give this a recommendation or not - and ultimately I have to say no, it doesn't deserve it.  This IS a great little card game and I really like the way it plays. Mechanically it works well once all the different card abilities have been unlocked, and I like how it eases new players in to the game. There is some strategic decision making to be had, and there is also a 'push your luck' aspect which mixes things up nicely. The graphics are good, but the pirate theme is pasted on.  There's two things that stop me giving this a recommendation:  1. There is no multiplayer. If this game had online multiplayer for 2 players I would not hesitate to recommend it. As it stands this omission makes the game feel a bit pricey for what it is.  2. Unbalanced AI. Far too many times the AI will manage to put together a combo that is just amazing (it's not uncommon to see a significant lead wiped out in one hand), or will draw in such a way that it doesn't make sense (for example sometimes the AI will stop drawing after 2 useless low value cards and bank them; this could be a strategic decision, but every time it happens the next card turned over would have made the AI Bust).   It all leads to too much frustration for what should be a fun time waster.",

Both the app and board game have their pros and cons, but the game design is solid, the artwork is great, and most importantly, they're both really fun to play. Highly recommended as a fun diversion. The PC app is particularly fun because of all of the things you unlock and variants that you end up playing to help keep the game play fresh. I just wish it had a multiplayer option and continued to be developed by Stardock.",

            "review_text": "A time killer, just realize there is NOTHING random about the cards. At one point you will play numbers instead of suits. You will notice that you are pulling 3 card doubles about 80% of the time. Let's see, 2 cards drawing a third, 7 numbers total. That's 2 cards of 7 that will cause a double and 5 cards that won't. Does it seem like you are playing those odds. Now add the 2 card doubles. This game also has tension builders that are not needed. You have to rush your discard pick because it moves right away. The computer's is figured before the graphics even shows but the screen pauses and slowly scolls like it is choosing at a relaxed pace. Creating what seems to be an unfair illusion because the computer does not need that relaxed pace. Now the 'Busted' graphic does get old but it is also creating tension. First, you are being told repeatedly that you have failed. Next, clicking the mouse should remove it and the cards, starting the next hand. It doesn't work, you have to press the mouse a second time to remove the cards. Thus you try to match the timing of the double click or wait for 'busted' to disappear on it's own. As that tension builds you are now button mashing thinking that will speed it up. One click should finish the process but they want that tension there. It helps the AI appear to be a tougher opponent. Actually the AI follows a pretty basic set of commands. In the end the Devs ruined the game by adding these things so I cannot recommend it.",

I am counting the moments until they add online multiplayer. If you enjoy card games and don't own this game. You are truly missing out on something special. I highly recommend this title. The game itself as well as it's interface for the windows version are top notch. No bugs, no freezes, no issues at all. The Dev's even posted that they would consider adding MP if there was enough interest. I hope everyone will post requesting it in the forums today.",

It's a bit complicated to understand the mechanics, but once you got an idea of how everything works together and what combos are possible, it starts to get really entertaining. BUT: DMD gets frustrating in late game. Reason? The AI is balanced in early ~, but I'd prefer it if they failed drawing as much cards as I do. No matter what I do, AI always gets the needed card to win on the river. Made me uninstall it, because it really makes no sense to play when anything I do is getting countered on the last card. Tried for like 100 times. 100 times last card win.   Call it bad luck? Maybe. I call dips on bad balancing.",

The rule-set is initially very simple, with more rules and features introduced as the player progresses, providing a smooth introduction to the finer points of playing the game.   As with many card games, luck plays an enormous factor in your success or failure, but there is also a significant degree of skill that can be applied to influence the outcome of a game.   A single round of the game takes only a minute or two, meaning that this is an excellent 'filler game' for when you only have 5 minutes to play something quickly. That said, there's a reasonably long campaign-style progression, which continually offers new opponents with various abilities and tweaks to the rules to keep things interesting over many hours of gameplay, and it's easy to get sucked into 'one more round'.   Overall, it's a splendid little game.   ",
