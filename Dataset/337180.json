            "review_text": "Huh - cool little game. Certainly worth the price of admission.   While I can appreciate the dynamics of switching back and forth between ship and 'on foot', I must confess to enjoying the side-scrolling portions more; it's fun to direct Lt. Kai Tana as she runs around jumping, blasting and teleporting.  The developer should consider using this character in a different game genre - third person action/adventure &amp; exploration would be ideal. Hot cyborg chicks with cool abilities NEVER get old and I think Lt. Tana would thrive in a larger game.",

            "review_text": "I was really stoked about this game when I first saw it. Paid way more than I should have because I was so excited to play it. Great graphics, beautiful music, the default controls were counterintuitive but was able to customize those easily enough once I figured out how to best lay the controls out.   Played through the first 8 levels without a problem. Level 9 refuses to load. Publisher blames Nvidia's Win 10 driver. Widespread problem but nobody seems to care or be able to do anything about it. This problem has been going on now since August of 2015 with no resolution in sight.   Great game. Has the makings to be a true stand out title that is at the same time familiar and innovative. A spiritual successor to the original Metroid games. Unfortunately, I can not recommend due to the fact that this game is simply broken and abondoned at this point... What a pity, too.",

            "review_text": "This game looks great and has so much potential, but it’s ultimately really disappointing. When I first encountered Velocity 2X, I thought that I was going to get something like The Guardian Legend on NES – an action/adventure epic mixed with a SHUMP game. The Guardian Legend is one of my favorite games, so I was excited. Unfortunately, Velocity 2X’s action and SHUMP sections are boring, repetitive, and not compelling at all.   The whole thing feels more like a time-wasting mobile game than a full-priced title (25 bucks Canadian, which is insane). The platforming sections are more like an endless runner type of game than the 2D platformer/Metroidvania sort of adventure that you may be expecting. You just rush through each stage, jumping over lava, gathering crystals, and avoiding obstacles/taking out enemies as fast as you can. The SHUMP sections are again very mobile-esque: quickly rush through the mission and be careful about getting caught on anything that might blow you up.  If the gameplay is shallow and repetitive, the controls don’t help very much. The teleportation mechanic is very poorly done in both game modes, and the entire process of dashing, sprinting, shooting, and teleporting during the platforming sections is really awkward and clunky. The game wants you to move quickly and accurately, but it never feels natural or pleasant.   Now, not everything about the game is bad. The graphics are very clean and sharp, and the art style is striking. I really like the character designs, and Kai Tana is an awesome heroine. I think that most people will find themselves drawn to the game because of the art and production quality, and I can't blame them - it looks great! The cinema scenes are pretty good and the writing is mostly brisk, funny, and enjoyable. The soundtrack is also quite decent, but the same song gets old after you’ve heard it a million times.  That's where the good stuff ends, though. Everything else about Velocity 2X is just undercooked at best. I can't believe how much they're charging for this. I know that the game has an attractive exterior and you might be tempted to try it out, but I would recommend steering clear of this one, even on sale...it just felt like a waste of my time.",
