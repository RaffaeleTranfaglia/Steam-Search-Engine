Positives: -soundtrack (good if you like dubstep) -amusing -free to play Negatives: -both camera angles provided are abysmal -character models and animations are bizarre -AI barely functions as intended -no servers whatsoever, therefore limited to single player -no map function/zoom This game needs a lot of work. Until then, you won't catch me playing it again. My first experience with WAR7:         YouTubeâ„¢ Video:  WAR7 gameplay&nbsp;",
