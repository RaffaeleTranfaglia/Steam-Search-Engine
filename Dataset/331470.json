I can´t say that I didn´t like the girls Endings, but they where ... well, sort of okayish at best. As a Horror-fan I definetely liked the Sasha/Miku Route. But Yulyas route ... well, that one has been in full cry. I guess it´s almost safe to say, that we´ve got one of the games here, which becomes better the older YOU are when you´re playing it. Perhaps its just a personal thing - I don´t really know, nor do I actually care - but, I suppose the older you are, the more you have actually experienced in your life, the more you´ll be able to understand what the protagonist is thinking about, what is bothering him. On the other hand - it actually manages it, to give you this slight nostalgic feeling. Which is interesting in a certain way .... I grew up in western Germany, in the late 1980s I was a little bit younger than Semyon. I should not really be able to compare my expiriences to the life of an adolescent in the late years of the sovient union. It might be a side effect of this game, a wanted thing - or whatever you prefer to call it ... but darn, I can relate. It sort of feels familiar. Okay, it wasn´t called Pioneers - we had boy scouts, like in the states. But ♥♥♥♥, some memories surely came back. It actually leads me to some sort of conclusion, I´ve had heard some while ago: It doesn´t matter where you live, where you´ve grown up - the basic hopes, wishes and desires remain the same - anywhere. So - I´d like to tip my hat to the developers, for granting us an interesting experience here and I hope this won´t be that last game we see from you.",

            "review_text": "Some don't like this game because there's not much choice.   Facts are there isn't a lot of choiceand in some conversations I would've said different things than what the player character would have said.  Some don't like this game because boobs/anime/it's an eroge/it's a VN/it's a dating sim.  Honestly, I've never been one to like dating sims (look at my most played games) or anime, or any of the things above. I never hated them but never really thought it was for me.   Anyways this game kinda changed that. Sure there's women with large breasts and sex if you add the hentai patch. However the focus is on the characters and the relatively mature themes of what to do with life, the nature of existence, and the excellent plot, and most importantly, the effects of one's actions on others. The writing apart from the funky translation is good, but if you've talked to actual russian girls they tend to say things the same way so there's a degree of veracity to it.  This ties in well with the nice soundtrack and excellent background art.  Also of note is that each ending really has a different message and life lesson. Is it a little corny? sure, but at the same time it feels like it was a good use of my time and made me really feel. Not only one emotion, but probably every ending will bring a different range of emotions.  Then once you've finished all the basic girl endings, the game takes that and throws it out the window. It goes to almost Tarkovsky levels of insanity and mind/reality bending and will make you super confused. Think through it for an hour, put the pieces together and you'll realise the developers were either blackout drunk or genius when they wrote the overarching story. Then, you truly have experienced this game.  Overall, if I was to describe this game in 3 words? Feels, thoughts, experience.",

            "review_text": "My first ever game review here; and I will explain shortly why this is the case.  I normally don't bother writing reviews for anything because when I write a review, it is usually serious and well thought-out, and that takes time. A lot of time.  Now why did I bother to write a review this time, for this Free-To-Play (eroge?) game no less? Because the contents of this game totally (and very surprisingly) entertained and amused me for the past few hours I played it from start to finish without so much as a pause.  Now, I don't play eroge games often. In fact, I never played one, until Everlasting Summer that is. I simply played this game because, well, it's free; but also because the other reviews heavily favours its storytelling over the visual aspect of the game. Curiosity got the better of me, so I thought, 'Why not? First time for everything, right?' Well, I will tell you readers right now, that my past few hours playing this game was well spent. And so is the time fleshing out this review at the moment...  It isn't just the storytelling of this visual novel that is entertaining. The music is very good given that this is a Free-To-Play, and they really suit the atmosphere of the scenes. The only complaint I have about the music is that sometimes you get electric guitar solos playing durings scenes where the characters appear to be playing an acoustic guitar - totally immersion-breaking. But otherwise, for the majority of the game the music is awesome and very well laid out.  What adds more to the atmosphere is the writing style. If you can turn a blind eye over some grammar/spelling mistakes (which there are very very few considering how much text this game contains), the descriptions of emotions, sceneries, thoughts and atmospheres etc are very detailed and beautiful. Perhaps when coupled with the background music or sound, you really start to feel lost in the story as you dive into it.  Perhaps the only major complaints I have about this game is that it takes at least an hour or two (in your first playthrough) before you really start to get past the 'introduction' of the story. During my first two hours, I came real close to stopping for a save and perhaps continue it, maybe 2 months later or something... Because of the slow-paced nature of the story, but also I was getting tired of the narrator describing every single emotion or feeling he feels for every piece of dialogue he is engaged with, whether he's speaking to or listening to someone. In that sense, there is a degree of repetition which can get annoying. I feel that if I get to make more choices rather than make a single choice every 10 minutes of reading, it would make things more interesting at least.  However, if you managed to get past the initial 2 hours or so (depending on how fast a reader you are of course), you will find yourself making decisions that somehow make you wonder if they really make a difference... Which I can assure you that they do. I have only played through this once so far and I happened to get the 'good neutral ending' because my decisions were based on what I would actually do if I were to be myself (i.e. I wasn't trying to be a bad Johnson flirting with every chick in the game). In fact, I was actually trying to hook myself up with a specific character but because I made a small blunder trying to get to know the other girls first, I ended up giving up the opportunities to learn more about the one girl I was going for... (And I didn't know the story only lasts for several ingame days rather than weeks...) So all in all, if you're aiming to date one of the girls, shoot for her at every opportunity you can get, because if you miss your chance, you may very well have to restart your game to win her heart.  Long story short, this game is simple in design; perhaps at times too simple, but it mimicks certain aspects of real life (other than you seem to be the magnet of every girl in the game) in a sense that if you lose your opportunity, you might not recover from it at all. And at the same time, the storyline isn't hell-bent on chasing after skirts. Like I said, I ended up with the 'good neutral' ending albeit unintentionally. And I won't spoil you, but even the good ending itself contains a plot twist...  In terms of replayability, I would say if you are a completionist or you like choice-based storytelling games, and definitely you aren't foreign to reading tons of texts, then you will certain feel at home with this one. However, give it at least one go if you don't mind the occasional cleavage or panty shot. As for me, I am definitely replaying this. (Not for the cleavage and panty shots, although those can be the icing on the cake, perhaps?) ;)",

Of course there is some ecchi scenes but is not the main core on this game. It's more important core is its story with the thoughts and feelings of the main character (Semyon) about his own life, a boring one, and how change on misterious travel on the pioneer camp.  If you like VN deal with it now, is free and really recommended one of the best on Steam. Anyone who not dislike VN but is not a genre's fan try at least to play a couple minutes because its story is interesting and has so many replayability (13 endings).  Just some bit errors on spelling english but not really bad. Is enjoyable and quiet understandle.  EDIT: After beating Alisa (bad and good), Ulyana (bad and good), Semyon (bad and good) and Lena (only bad) endings... LET ME told you this: THIS GAME IS A MASTERPIECE OF ART, you will laugh and enjoy but will cry and be sad too. The best Visual Novel I've ever played.",

I seen all but the last 3 endings. I like to do a review after I am 100% done with the 'game' (and yes I called it a game but its 95% visual novel and 5% game) with 13 diffrent ending and I have seen 10 of them, this is so worth any one time nearly for a week this is all I have been reading(I have only had it for about a week I think). The story just kind of draws you in right from the start, like any good book or movie it gets you up to speed with who the main character is and the story just take you a way always making you want to find out more.   This will make you laugh, it will make you cry, it will make you think back to your youth (I say that it might really take you back if your in your late 20's to late 30's) It reminded me of what it was like as a teenager. This story was written really well, after reading almost every thing in this, im going to be kind of sad when theres no more to read. There are a few images that are blocked from this Steam version, (even though I unlocked them from the creators) it takes away almost nothing more than a description of what was on the screen for no more than like 15 sec, and it has no impact on the story at all really. But its written so well that even if they had only just the images of the characters, it will still work. The fact that this is free, really shocks me on how well it looks and written as well as the music.   The music is spot on and it done so well that it up there with the best of the Final Fantasy's music. It fits so well that it just adds that extra kick to make this game great. Give every one who made this novle alot of credit, the fact that they translated from Russen to English (it was really good translation, a few things here and there, but nothing noticable) They even have pop ups that let you know what some thing mean, they thought a head and knew that alot of people did not grow up in Russa, and they tell you ehat some things mean, and thats some thing I have never seen done before.   My Final thoughts is, download it. Its well worth your time, the fact that its free is in my mind almost criminal the fact thats its free for what your getting. It proves that 'Free' can be really good if some one is committed to making some thing good weather it be book, game, or movies. Everlasting Summer has left an everlasting impression on me and it might do the same thing for you as well. Soviet Games standing ovation!!!!!",

I loved the art,both the sprites and the CG. Absolutely lovely. You can tell certain CGs are just copypastes of each other when it comes to which girl you pick, but it's fine.   Characters are loads of fun and unique. The overall story is okay. Even at the very end, I don't really know what happened. Good endings are pretty damn good. Bad endings are interesting. The special endings are great too. There's not much to say actually. It was great. I wouldn't mind more characters and such, or a similar game. AND IT WAS FREEEEEE. So I recommend it if you like dating sims or interesting surreal stories. Other than the boring beginning and certain boring scenes near the endings, I think story was good, characters were great, and art/music phenomenal.   SPOILER:  Lena was always crazy. I ♥♥♥♥ing knew it. Her Good ending only brings MORE questions up. I don't trust her.",

It felt really nostalgic (tho i am acually too young to remember comunism it self, facilities like these were still used some time after revolution).

Pros:  -Free to Play, emphasis on FREE -Gorgeous Scenery and backgrounds -Interesting story (at the time of this review and only on Day 5) -Hatsune Miku (or at least a character who really resembles her, which is probably why this game is free to play due to copyright) -The following characters are interesting and/or easy to get along with. Somewhat typical and expected of a dating sim game, but the better charcaters of this game (at the time of the review): Alisa, Slavya, Lena, Miku -Nice looking female characters (as expected of a dating sim, but especially nice since everyone's wearing identical costumes). the character designs are a good in between; not too extreme but not too generic. *** - The creators of the game proofread the English version, so most of the typos and lose English is fixed, though you may still occasionally see Alisa's name listed as Alice in some dialouge boxes. For those who've already played the game or have old save files however, you may not be able to fast-forward as much as you want because the new English Proofread dialouge counts as 'unseen' text that you may not be able to skip past. - Semyon is a very interesting character. You play the game from his point of view but he's very different from other dating sim male leads i've played as thus far. He actively questions what's going on around him and i've often found myself relating to him in the various situations he gets himself in and feeling the same way toward the girls he intereacts with (for better of for worse). He's very smart for a player-avatar character and i wish more of these types of characters come to future dating sims (especially when the lead is a female). -    Depending on which girl you pursue, you'll find that the story's genre may even change (at least that's how i saw it). Different things will happen, some things will have been real, other things will have just been a beautiful dream, you may even see that your dreams came true in some form should Semyon wake up at all. It makes me want to get all of the endings and achievements to see what's actually Semyon's reality and what's his dream! BRAVO DEVS, BRAVO!      Cons:    -If you're a grammer Nazi, good luck reading this game in English... Everything from simple typos to ordering of words and even character names can be messed up (most notable with Alisa, whose name can appear as Alice in the dialouge box)  *** -No gay routes, only hetero routes (though because this game is originally Russian, I can't exactly blame them for that) -All of the characters with the exceptions of the ones i mentioned above... ARE ANNOYING AND/OR DATING SIM STEREOTYPES. Ulyana is an extremely annoying child (why can no one ever write a child character that isn't the devil, annoying or both?), Olga is extremely bossy (if i read the phrase 'line-up' one more time i might stab my computer screen and i think Seymon feels the same way), Electronik and Shurik are typical male characters in dating sims in that they either encourage hooking-up, force the player into doing something they normally wouldn't do or just being in the background compared to the main female characters of the game. And of the two other male characters, i find that only Electronik is helpful and at least somewhat interesting. -All of the female character's I've mentioned in the con's part of the review also seem to suffer from the rapidest of mood swings. Olga is nice one second, the next second she's like a dictator; Ulyana is still extremely annoying and Zhenya seems to go from a nuetral mood to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off for no reason within seconds. You may argue that the tsundere of the game, Alisa, also has these rapid mood swings but at least hers are enjoyable to watch and read and she isn't as bossy as Olga and    her moodswings are explained somewhat in her route as well as hinted at in Lena's   . In addition Alisa has her sweet/adorable moments unlike any of the female characters i've mentioned in the cons. - After a while you feel like you're dragging Semyon through one event after the other. You are given some choices which will help you in getting the different endings but after a few playthroughs you already know you'll have to do certain tasks without any yes or no and you'll be forced to do them over and over again. It'll feel like a pain after a while, but this is remedied somewhat because Semyon is very nice and relatable (at least to me). -This game's setting is set in a time during the USSR, which makes a history-lover like myself want just a little more history in the game or at least some more history trivia   Overall, this game is free to play and so i can complain all i want, but hey i payed nothing for it. The annoying characters are still annoying as hell, the other male characters just seem to be there for the sake of being there like typical 'best friend' male characters in these kinds of games, the English translation was proofread and the text is easier to read now. And the characters who i mentioned in the Pros are enjoyable and easy to get along with. AND IT'S STILL FREE!  I give this game 4.5 beautiful summers out of 5",

            "review_text": "Everlasting summer is a visual novel from developers Soviet Games aka Erogame Project released in 2013. It is currently available in Russian, English and Spanish.  Story: The story revolves around our protagonist Semyon, in his mid-twenties, who seems to have given up on life. But one day he ventures to the 410th bus and boards it, only to wake up outside a pioneer camp. Now he must find a way out while living a week in the camp. Most of them time the story feels like the usual slice of life/romance VN but it really shines when the main focus is on Semyon trying to find out why he is at that pioneer camp and how to get back home. The whole story, including the different paths and endings, is at a decent length with about 15-20 hours of playtime.  Writing (English version): The writing is ok for the most part. There are some typos and grammatical errors but nothing too distracting, also the developers native language is not English so these mistakes can be forgiven.  Characters: The characters are likeable and their interactions with each other is quite enjoyable. On the surface all the characters are quite generic stereotypes (energetic, shy, etc.) but they always seem intriguing and that there is more to them.  Art: Is a mixed bag for me. I really like the backgrounds, sprites and overall character design. The problem I have with the art are the CGs. Some of them are just bad, some make the characters look different and just a few of them are really good.  Soundtrack: Not much to say here. For me, there are no songs that stand out but on the other hand I wasn't annoyed of any of them either. Most of the time the songs match the scene nicely and that's what is most important.  Overall: I'd recommend Everlasting Summer. Besides its flaws there is an intriguing story with likeable characters and a satisfactory ending.   And it's FREE, so why not give it a try?",

Although you spend a couple of days with them doing all kinds of stuff, you dont get to delve deeper into who they really are as in KS. All in all a worthwhile read with some of the best looking backgrounds ive ever encountered in a VN.  Update: WOW! Just finished the DLC Zhenya route and it really makes the whole journey complete.

That's why Everlasting Summer offers a different experience for someone who has already read some Visual Novels, but at the same time it performs well as a Novel for a beginner.  The first story arcs revolve around the girls and the camp and how Semyon's relationship with the girls will change him as a person. The 'secret' route (and to some extent the DLC) however focuses on the mysterious world Semyon landed in. This mix between romance and mystery is well done; The spacing and the writing is great, though the story is often pretty predictable...except for Miku's route, that was ride from the beginning to the end and the name of the achievement for this route fits perfectly: 'What is this I don't even...'. What I should mention though is, that while not a completely new idea, this mysterious world is pretty well 'designed' and keeps the story really interesting; Especially that not everything will be explained about it and inviting the reader to make own assumptions. The artwork sadly wavers from Triple-A quality to mediocre fanart, which sometimes damages the atmosphere as characters change the art-style from one scene to another. Good thing is that doesn't happen that often. The soundtrack is pretty good, though there are better ones out there with tracks that stick in one's mind. But still, it does it's job. One thing worth mentioning is the implementation of the workshop, which opens up the option for altermate endings, continuations or completely new story arcs. Right now, there aren't many english mods, but that should change in the future.  Overall, I can only recommend this Visual Novel. The story and especially the world is darn interesting and I'm sure you won't be disappointed and/or bored by it.",

BRILLANT Soundtrack that I still play on my IPhone today (which still brings up that gut wrenching pathos). Unbelievably FREE. Worth the $45 dollars that Japanese Visual Novel run for. Each character with distinct endearing personality. On the Con: Sometimes too much writting. The Protagonist is an typical Idiot who cant recognize his own emotions and is unable to say- 'Hey Babe, I like you. Would you like to go out' till the end. But considering he is wrenched out of time and really a older man in a teenager's body, you cant be too hard on him. You first playthrough should be without cheating or with walkthrough. Otherwise you'll miss the emotional impact. Ending up with a bad end first and then using the walkthrough to fix your mistakes it what makes it memorable. As in 'IT CANT JUST END THIS WAY. NOOOOOO'. Recommendation All on Content. Graphics Endearing (Alisa Bashful and Mischevious is Pure Good). There Web Site should have a DONATE Link.",

I found the best part is trying to find out what the right choice is and then finding out that I screwed up at one point, but that's the fun you will have. I recommend this because the depth of the characters is so real, so lifelike, that I found myself trying to find out each choice and what effect it will have in the future. This is one of the games that uses the Butterfly Effect. If you don't know what that is, basically it's the theory that if you do one thing, another will happen. Basically think of it as choosing classes in high school. You can choose to be in, say, French with your friends and just goof around, or you can take a class like Spanish and actually learn something. And the fun of it is that if you choose one choice you won't know what happened if you chose the other. I really recommend this because of the fun you will have, the emotions you will feel, and the memories you will make.",

I dont really give away plot points just some of the features of the games... its hard to exsplain... if your worried just skip this and play the game for yourself)  First off this was my first 'dating sim' I put that in the search bar and this was one of the top results when I added the free to play section. I guess technicly its called a 'visual novel'. I was not prepared for the slow pace of the game, and while It does pick up in the later days I had to fight myself to keep playing when I first started.   What I liked,   I loved the art style and just the general mystery that the game presented and while I was discourged at first because of all the reading and the semi pointless narative (Mainly the in between characters) I rather enjoyed the story line.  As I said the story while slow at first did intresst me enought to continue to play and with its short maybe 4-5 hours of game play (I started about 11 and finsihed around 3:30) its a nice little game that you can kill time with trying to get one of the multitue of endings.   What I disliked   I generally did not like the pace of the game, it felt slow and only really got fast towards the end maybe this is because was the first time I've played a game like this. I would have loved to see some more backgrounds rather than just the still shots or different emotions on the characters. I understand thats hard to do with still frame pictures but still. I would have also liked to see diffrent views of the backgrounds like when falling asleep you where staring at the roof or maybe your room mate.   Finally I did enjoy this game and I would give it a 7/10 . It has a high replay value because of the many endings you can achive (I only have two). I do plan to replay and try and get the better ending and see what the DLC is about. The art is well done in most cases and the overall story is intresesting and puts intreseting thougts into the mind. also the translations and exsplanations are quite good and provide some intreseting knowlege. Im glad to see that this game was set in russia vrs japan or america.   Do I recomend this game?? well obvioulsy I do since this will have the recommendation tag, but yes I do recomend this game, its confusing at times but it is enjoyable.",

There isn't any action parts! -The various endings are somewhat the same, but have basic differences (outside of which girl you favored). -The dialogue is a bit kid-ish.

I came across this one in particular, and recalled almost laughing at the fact that it was in my eyes, a random free VN. Expecting it be to rated poorly, the outstanding support got me to download it.  Normally, I would have looked up a walkthrough for whichever character I liked best, and actually attempted this at first only to find out there is jack-all about this VN out there. Reddit has made mentions of it, although it's rarely upvoted, and vndb lacks anything besides the bare bones. TV Tropes doesn't mention it, and there is no 'walkthrough' from what I've seen, which is really nice. I can honestly state this is the first VN I've read, that I managed to come across a bad end purely by myself. Not even disappointing, in the end.  The thing I didn't like about it is the length, I was a huge fan of Grisaia no Kajitsu's length, because even without the amount of choices, you really got a good feel for those characters, which is something you don't really have in Endless Summers. The MC mentions it a few times that 'he barely knows anybody'. I believe Katawa Shoujo (which I see everybody comparing this to) had the similar amount of route length, but it just SEEMED to be more there, than here, for whatever reason. A little bit of the story seems to be absent minded filler to get to the next part, which isn't too heavily used.   Finally, to wrap things up, I didn't really have too much of an issue with the ways the characters looked. That may be due to I've seen some of the really 'terrible' ones from earlier VNs, but overall they looked alright. Not stellar, not terrible. The background art and music easily took up more of the focus than the indivual character artwork did though.  All in all, if you are already into Visual Novels, I'd advise you to grab Endless Summers. It's not a very good one to introduce you to them though, but it never hurts to try and prove me wrong.",

Reading is something I like but don't do anough of so a game like this gets me into the mood. The story is ok but I have not gotten to the end yet. You can enable the adult content in the game if you go to the developers website if you want or NEED it. I got this game for free so to give it a bad rating is obviously hard so let's imagine i did buy it for like $10. If I bought this game for ten dollars are less then I would say if you like reading and hentai then it is well worth it. I have not gotten to the end of the story and I read there ate like 13 different endings. Meh. Therefore, I will come back later and comment on the ending. But for free why not try the game and get some sweet hentai girsl and screenshots. Oh and a nice story too. Enjoy.",

            "review_text": "I'm not sure if I'm missing something, but I just didn't love this game. Once you get past the lol factor of playing a communist dating game, there's really not much to it.   I didn't find any of the characters new or relatable, least of all the protagonist, whose 'completely average in every way' schtick has been totally played out by essentially every other media form on planet earth, yet everyone likes him for whatever reason. Folks, we got us a bona-fide Gary Sue. He's unsocible and awkward to a fault, this much is establshed within the first 10 minutes, but he somehow gets along swimmingly in a camp full of girls. The fact that he isn't actually given a face in the art is a testament to how little work was put into him.  All of the romance options are based on overused cliches: you have the tsundere girl, the mischevious girl, the shy girl, the wholesome girl, to name a few. You name an anime trope, it's there. And Hatsune Miku is there, in Soviet Russia, for whatever reason? That probably broke a copyright law or ten. The fact that they're all based on anime cliches is jarring, considering its set in the Soviet Union.  The character art is also, like, really bad. The backgrounds are nice, but are overshadowed by the poorly done characters. The character designs themselves look incredibly forced- it seems like the designers were trying incredibly hard to make them look like anime/manga characters (see: Hatsune Miku) and totally missed the mark. Spiky bangs, unnatural hair colors, eyes the size of saucers, etc. work in anime, but this isn't anime, and they are clearly SUPPOSED to look like anime. Just incredibly forced.  This game was also clearly designed by men, for men; the character designs of all the romance options are blatant fanservice. There are a lot of clearly fanservice moments, too, such as spying on one girl in the shower, walking in on a girl changing, and watching two other girls (one literally like 12 years old, wtf) fight in the showers. Hatsune Miku's opening scene is a shameless crotch/panty shot (again, where did she come from?), and the girls spend like 30% of their time in beachwear (in Russia???). Like if that's something you're interested in, go for it, but the pedophilia options freak me out (and should freak you out too. I hope like hell that they freak you out too) and the fanservice isn't even well done. Everything looks like it was drawn by a 13 year old boy with the help of a 'How to Draw Manga' book he bought on sale at a craft store. Like, if you're going to do fanservice, do it well.   Gameplay itself is incredibly slow. You only get to make a few choices a day, and between those choices is what seems like an eternity of Semyon musing to himself- and oh, how he muses. His thoughts are full of psuedo-intellectual angst and are painful to read. The dialogue itself (Semyon actually interacts once or twice with other people when he gets tired of his whiny inner monologue) is fairly uninteresting. I'd chalk some of that up to being lost in translation, as I did the English version, but the rest must have been plain unoriginality. Part of what slows the game down so much is, I think, that every action is described by our friend Semyon, who is way, way too thorough.   The creators didn't seem to be able to make up their mind: is this game driven by romance or mystery? They get in the way of each other in Everlasting Summer. They tried to fit too much into one game and the focus seems scattered. One or the other needed to take the back burner, but instead, they were forced to coexist as equals, muddling the gameplay. If this was a mystery with a romance subplot or a romance with a mystery subplot, it would've played out more smoothly.   TLDR; The plotline isn't terrible, but it's not great. It's CERTAINLY not good enough to make up for how flat, uninventive, and crudely drawn the characters are. That being said, it's fun to laugh at the communist propoganda and the game's ridiculous enough to kill a few hours, and the music isn't awful. I played it through once, had some laughs, no harm no foul. I mean it's free, so why not?",

            "review_text": "Seeing so much positivity inspired me to play this game... unfortunately, I didn't see where all the hype was coming from. I may just be spoiled from other dating simulation visual novels, but the story felt sluggish and dragged on for a long time, even with the fast forward feature. The endings didn't thrill me; some of them disappointed me outright. The chemistry between the characters seemed to appear at strange times. On top of that, there were some lines in the game that hadn't been translated from Russian to English, at least one of them leaving me with a sense of confusion afterwards. Was what they said important? The response gave nothing away. The CGs left me conflicted, too. Some of them were beautifully done and fit the scene perfectly. Others were basically a trace-over with another character's hair drawn in and (in one case) another outfit drawn on. In this aspect it felt either lazy or rushed. On top of the visual issues I experienced, it felt like all the girls respond so similarly to you, even though they are supposed to have different personality types. It seems like there were moments when I'd think I was pursuing a different girl than the one I was, merely because of what she said when replying to me. It wasn't always the case, but when it was, I felt like I wasn't as involved in the game as I could have been.   On a positive note, this visual novel does keep you occupied for a long period of time. After getting all of the achievements, I had spent almost as much time in this experience as I would a typical JRPG. Some of the scenarios you can get into are interesting or funny. The music stands out and the backgrounds are BEAUTIFUL. The character sprites are expressive, so you can associate names and faces fairly early on. The story has a bit of depth to it which may be appealing for some people who are interested in existential thought.  Overall, this experience is not for me. I had higher expectations that weren't met, and, even though it's free, the time I spent on it would've been better used in other things. Much to the disagreement of others, I can't suggest my friends play this game.",
