            "review_text": "This game has a strong sense of immersion in space, and best of all no motion sickness or nausea after an extended session! The ability to target enemy ships with your eyes instead of moving your hand makes you able to react so much quicker and feel like part of the machine! CCP does a nice job of putting players in various roles in their vast universe (I also pilot ships with guns like these). Love it!",

            "review_text": "Simple but fun turret shooter with some cool sci fi VR stuff. It's short and sweet and fairly simple, but still a blast. And theres enough game in it to make it worthwhile.  Also, word to the wise, it'll complain that it doesnt work with VIVE controllers and needs a keyboard/control pad. It's lying to you. It works fine with VIVE controllers no problem. I intially tried playing it with a 360 pad, which works fine, but it was giving me control prompts for my VIVEmotes so I switched to them. Probobly the one negative I have to say about this game.",

Showed my non gameplaying brother in law the other day and I couldn't get him off it! I found it very immersive (I could almost imagine myself in one of the turrets of the Millenium Falcon blasting away!) Waves get steadily harder. I can see myself coming back to this game, just to blast a few ships now and again. This idea could be great too if it were used in a B-52. Imagine blasting away from the different gun turrets as you fly in the 1000 bomber raids.",
