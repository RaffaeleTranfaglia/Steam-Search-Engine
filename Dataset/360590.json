            "review_text": "The im it self is great and idea plus i like the gameplay! But theres a lot to fix! 1. Invetory form another game saves and you have those items forever. 2. In the world should be added more items and stuff to do. 3. Theres too much bushes in world for no reason .. 4. The zombies should not jump when they attack you and should do more damage plus be faster. 5. Jumping and sprinting are op so you can almost fly if you know how to bhop 6. The invetory should open by one key (not press e then go items) 7. It will be cool if this game had hotbar so you can switch items bweeteing 1-6 or 1-5  8. Theres no reason you can drop you arm in game.. so you cant use arms if you dont have them in invetory to equip them.. 9. Plz do this before you do any update or such stuff :D  The game is awesome buy it guys!!!!!",
