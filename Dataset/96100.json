            "review_text": "Defy Gravity (henceforth known as DG) is an example of what a small indie game should be.  Gameplay: Based on two types of gravity spheres, one pushing you away and one pulling you towards it. Using these you have to traverse levels and bounce/throw yourself across pits. Overall the gameplay is simple, standard WASD and mouse, plus having support for a controller.   Graphics&amp;Sound: What are you expecting out of an indie game? The sound is above average, as the music is pretty nice. The graphics are typical, though not bad enough to be annoying. The one complaint i do have with this game is that your character looks as if he's using a Super Soaker rather than a gravity gun.   The Good:  I got this when it was on sale for $.14 (yes, 14/100) and it was a nice, cheap pickup. It'll provide a good amount of fun.  The Bad:  The controls are a bit wonky and some of the levels require split-second reactions.  Overall Grade: C+  Not Bad, but it's a small game, good to play if you got a few minutes to kill.",

            "review_text": "Defy Gravity Extended it's an indie game based in physics / gravity laws. It could looks like a horrible game.   I mean art and animations are simple and it can feels empty, otherwise it's too challenging.   You can feel that it's a 2D version of 'Portal', you have a gun that has two functions, repel and attract.  Something that i loved in this game was the relaxing background music that makes you relax during stressful levels.  It has enough good levels and after finish it the nightmare haven't finished yet, you have to complete it twice in order to get all achievements, something that will make you rage.  It's always on discount (95% off i guess), so if your style it's the challenges you can give it a chance.  7.5 / 10  If you found this review helpful you can find out more at our  Completing the Backlog's Curator page.

The biggest asset is obviously the freedom to choose while solving puzzles and a feeling that the laws of physics are at our mercy. The graphics and music are perfectly matched. Everything is in its place and a pleasure for both the eye and the ear. So take a gun in hand and ... go right? Yes. It's just a simple, small, modest low-budget minigame.",

            "review_text": "Defy Gravity is a tiny little physics-based puzzle platformer in which you manipulate your movement through the creation of gravity and anti-gravity wells, allowing you to conquer assorted obstacles.   Almost everything about the game is somewhat reminiscent of the big days of browser-based flash games. Fairly generic music loops, non-existent story, simplistic art style, and a pretty short length compared to most games on Steam (30-60 minutes for a basic playthrough, or 90-120 minutes if you're including all achievements/hard mode). The concept's not too bad, but the puzzle design is somewhat repetitive and the difficulty progression is very uneven (the final supposed-to-be-climactic puzzle is actually one of the easiest rooms in the game).  Overall, there are plenty of worse ways to spend an hour or so. Defy Gravity is definitely worth the summer sale price of $0.29 - especially considering it comes with Steam Trading Cards which you can easily sell back for more than that. At full price, however, the cost is a bit steep for the paltry amount of content here. Grab it if it's on sale and you have a huge fetish for physics puzzles, or not at all.",
