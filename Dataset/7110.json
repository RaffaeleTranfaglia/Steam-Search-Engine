            "review_text": "Jade Empire is without a doubt a very good game. It stands, however, very firmly, as a mid-point between Bioware's other landmark titles: Knights of the Old Republic and Mass Effect. It is very recognisable as a spiritual successor to the gameplay style of Knights of the Old Republic. On the other hand, you can see much that would go into Mass Effect being developed in Jade Empire. It says more than anything about Jade Empire that I could not write a paragraph in review without mentioning Bioware's other two excellent titles.  The characters and their development, the storyline, and quite frankly the world developed around them, simply doesn't live up to the heights generated by the other series mentioned herein. It perhaps helps with immersion that I was a Star Wars fan prior to playing Knights of the Old Republic; but Mass Effect's dramatic introduction of an entirely new universe was simply amazing and Jade Empire achieves nothing of the sort. It is a nice world, more densely populated than Knights of the Old Republic which makes it feel more immersive. But unfortunately it just does not stand out. It is not particularly memorable, and there is virtually no reason at all for the game to be open-world (when it does open up). If you are thorough, there is literally no reason to return to places you have visited in the past in Jade Empire, and that is rather unfortunate.   It is an aging game, so the graphics look a little dated at this point but you can still see that for their time they were quite pretty and it does not in any way impact the enjoyability of this title. The gameplay is also quite interesting, very fast-paced and there are a really wonderful array of fighting-styles that your character can learn. Slightly unfortunate, however, is the loss of the ability to play as other characters at will, which was a welcome feature included in Knights of the Old Republic.   All in all, this game is definitely worth looking into, especially for fans of Bioware's other excellent RPG titles. I have been rather critical in this review but it is only because Bioware has soared so much higher in other outings and with so much potential it is rather unfortunate that Jade Empire failed to achieve these expectations. Nonetheless, I still consider it one of the better RPG games I have played and would recommend giving it a shot. 8/10.",

            "review_text": "I bought Jade Empire when I found it in a bin for exactly 2 euros. Years later I bought it again on steam for another 2 euros. All I can say is: money well spent.   A lot of people will tell you that Jade Empire is Bioware's weakest game. When you measure any rpg up to Knights of the Old Republic or the original Mass Effect, chances are your perspective is going to be a bit disadvantageous for Jade Empire. This isn't star wars, and this certainly isn't mass effect, but it is a unique game that has all the makings of greatness.  I was bummed out in Knights of the Old Republic when I learned that the combat would be dictated by a D&amp;D dice roll system. This is the kind of uncertainty I hate, the kind of unrefined gameplay that has absolutely no excuse to exist in the modern world. Jade Empire does away with that and gives you live action, direct, fist to face combat. It has aged like a biscuit though. It is tough, rigid, and unrefined by todays standards, but a step up from the roulette style gameplay from Knights. Combat is fun for while, but you'll quickly find yourself looking for ways to dispatch your foes as fast as possible. The game offers various options. Martial Arts allow you to attack your enemies with your bare knuckles and are generally effective against all enemies. Elemental Styles allow you to throw fire or ice (bending if you will) at the cost of chi. Various weapons are very effective against humans, but useless against spirits. Support styles allow you to set up your enemies for a finishing blow. And at a hefty chi price there are the transformation styles that allow your to morph into a being of pure awesome to obliterate your foe. There is plenty of choice for you to customise your style, and the game gives you a fine world to flaunt your skills.  Jade Empire is set in an oriental world. Full of references to Chinese, Japanese, Indian and Bhuddist mythology. If you have ever watched Avatar: the Last Airbender then you should get the idea. There aren't many games out there like this and Bioware has done a great job at crafting a world that looks the part. This is the nice thing about Jade Empire. You'll want to walk around and talk to people, help them (or ruin them, you know the drill). In the end though you'll still be after the same thing thing: Saving your master. You play a martial arts student, whose life is uprooted when a secret orderer invades your hometown and kidnaps your master. Que the hero music and get to it.   It is a shame Jade Empire has ages so poorly. The controls are fluent as a beached whale, and the character models are not always as polished as they could be. Still, its universe and setting are unique and if you like a decent RPG of westen make then do not hesitate to get this.",

            "review_text": "I loved this game when I played it on the original Xbox. Now I can't imagine why. It has possibly the worst combat and camera controls of any game I've ever played.   During combat, some button presses are often delayed by a few seconds. If you begin a combo and then try to dodge, it will complete the combo before dodging. Often so much time has passed between when you press the dodge button and when you actually dodge that you may no longer want to dodge. But you will. Oh yes, you will. The same goes for if any enemy is hitting you. You will wait for the enemy to finish THEIR combo before you dodge/attack. Basically, the combat is very stilted and unresponsive.   The camera is perhaps even worse. It's understandable given the age of the game and the hardware it was developed on that the camera would be somewhat limited. You can only tilt the camera up, not down, and the camera movement is very imprecise. That's all forgiveable. What is not forgiveable is how the camera behaves in combat. If you are fighting near a wall the camera will tilt at odd angles preventing you from seeing what is going on. This becomes especially annoying when you are fighting in a small room. You may be fighting blind 75% of the time.  There are other issues with the game, as well, such as the invisible barriers that surround you during battles, the stilted dialogue, the overly simplistic RPG elements (there are only three attributes), and the fuzzy cutscenes.  I just can't recommend this game, which is a pity. I really did love it on Xbox. Kind of makes me question the judgment of past me.",

This is a fantastic game to start out with if you're new to Bioware. It's a new world with a great combat system. Fantastic story and AMAZING combat system. Unfortunately the combat system is very easily breakable (I won't say how) with the ability to stun lock whole groups of enemies (and even the final boss) and just get a load of free hits. You will NOT take damage after a certain point if you get the 'right' skills.  Yeah this review is short because all I can say is get it, the game is great but the combat is a bit exploitable.

            "review_text": "I am so glad this game came out on steam! I have been a fan of bioware games since KotoR. I bought this on x-box when it first came out and every now and then I break out my old xbox to play. Now I won't have to do that and to be honest my old xbox is running on it's last leg.   I haven't played much of the game since getting it on steam but it is pretty much the same. The special edition does offer at lease one new character if my memory is right because I don't remember monk zeng from the original. The graphics seem to have gotten a bit of an upgrade too. When it first came out I have no idea if it was on pc or not but the graphics are 100x better than what they were on xbox.   Noww all that said I do have to say I do agree with other reviews that the game is technically 'broken' and should be fixed if steam is going to continue to sell it. But the broken feature is really easy to fix. I ran into two problems when trying to play. First the game kept telling me it couldn't find steam. This was an easy fix by copying the steam.dll file in the steam folder and pasting a copy in the Jade Empire folder. After that the game still crashed on start up. So I had to rename the launcher as JadeEmpire_BACKUP and rename another .exe file as JadeEmpireLauncher. It wasn't hard at all and the istructions I found online were much more helpful than this review. While it was a minor inconvenience it isn't enough to stop anyone from getting this game. Totally worth it to play one of the best games bioware has put out!",

The setting gets a lot right to have you feel comfortable in the world. The game gives you a decent variety of protagonists and being a Bioware game, romance options. Combat is solid, and I'd say works better than KOTOR. I'd even say that the graphics hold up well given the age of the game.

The characters are fairly engaging and there's some good development there, with some nice branching the player can choose. Not quite as deep as Mass Effect, but good nonetheless. Voice acting was well-done and the story itself proved satsifying.  However, the graphics are a bit dated and the combat itself a tad underwhelming. Fighting was too easy and once you grasp the fairly basic system there's really no way you should ever die even though I played the game with a controller (configuring the controls were a bit of a minor inconvenience in the beginning)  Overall a good game, 8/10, and certainly deserves a sequel.

            "review_text": "This is a borderline positive recommendation, for a number of reasons.  The story as a whole is good, but dissapointing. It is a very predictable story. You are a student to a great, but unknown master with a dark past that wants to keep you safe until the hand of destiny itself sets you on a path to restore balance in the empire. There is a twist that feels telegraphed and a bit of mystery surrounding one of the characters that gives itself away before you're even two hourse in, if you're paying attention. It is short, but in this case it's a good thing, as the story is so generic it would feel like wading through a pool of undried cement. At just about 25 hours, give or take, it paces itself rather well and is coherent, but for a game with conversation options, it's extremely linear, especially once you enter the fortress. The biggest let down is the conversations. Each conversation you are given a number of lines you can choose which amount to nothing unless it's an obvious good vs. evil type of choice. Each character you speak to reacts almost the same way and says the same things regardless of your answer, with some exceptions with the three romance options (two per gender). Also, every important character that you encounter more often than once will repeat themselves almost endlessly. In one conversation I had with the Water Dragon, she told me the same thing no less than seven times, to the detriment of my already dying brain.  The combat is, well, annoying. On one hand it's dynamic, keeping you involved in every fight, which is a good thing. On the other hand it's repetitive and even outright annoying. Your attacks have this bothersome ability of knocking back the enemy you are attacking just out of reach of your next attack, unless you pin them to the edge of the fight zone. Fast styles are almost hands down superior to any slower style because each attack interrupts your enemy (unless they are a massive enemy like the toad or elephant demons or the jade golems). The mechanics of each enemy, while interesting at first become a nuisance the further you go into the story, especially ghosts. There is one mini game (thankfully) in the game, but I won't go into it as you can effectively skip all of it unless you want to finish a character's quest line. The other ones are useless, or next to. The redeeming quality is the game's companion characters. For a short game they are rather one dimensional but interesting enough to last you the first half of the game after which you won't get anything more than remarks out of them, with the exception of your romance option. They will comment as you adventure and then when you all group up again will act like they were just then hearing about what was happening for the first time. However, they are colorful and fit very well within their one dimension, fleshing it out very well.   I understand that the review seems rather negative, but I rather enjoyed the game, with some glaring exceptions. Jade Empire is akin to that somewhat annoying dinner guest, who is pleasant enough company but you can't quite wait for them to leave, as much as you might wish to feel otherwise.  Overall this is a game that, in my opinion, desperately needs a sequel to redeem itself. I recommend it, but only barely. If you are looking to play an action game with a modicum of morality and interaction, this would fit quite well, but if you are looking for an actual rpg, this would not fit that bill",

Upgrade them to become more awesome, and use your spirit amulet to enhance your core stats. Followers help by either fighting along side you, or offering support. The only real downside is once you beat the game and learn the styles, it's a breeze and a half, but there's four difficulty settings, so even the most veteren player can have a challenege.
