            "review_text": "Rainbow Six is back with a new title and it's only multiplayer, but will you want to play it ?  Rainbow Six Siege the new game in the Rainbow Six series. This game rose up from the ashes of what once was Rainbow Six Patriots.   The game is set in current times where the fight against terrorism is full blown out. Terrorist are conducting massive attacks around the world and you play as either the terrorists or the rainbow unit which consists of worldwide response units.   As stated before the game has no story whatsoever. The only thing you can do solo is a situation mode which teaches you the basics of the game and the incredibly fun Terrorist Hunt mode. The game has one story mission which is online only which tasks you to go to a US college and defuse a toxic bomb, the mission is notable because it obscures your vision with toxic gas and you need to work as a team to defuse the bombs, cause the mission is really difficult.  The AI for solo mode is not stupid so you won't be able to Rambo the entire map. You will have to be smart with your actions since the AI is pretty smart. They change up they're routes and will try to flank you and rush you any chance they get, they're aim is pretty good as well.   Now for the reason you might want to buy the game, THE PVP.   Trust me when I say this, the game is no joke. This game is incredibly difficult and doesn't hold your hand. You will need to work as a team if you want to win. A well placed shot will take you out and a well planned attack might earn you a sweet victory.  The game suits many play styles, from a support who helps out teammates in the field, to a pyromaniac who likes to blow up everything in sight. You will definitely find an operator that suits you the best.  Even though there's not many maps, each map is very dynamic. It's big enough for you to defend, but no matter what remember, you are never safe. You can destroy almost every wall, ceiling or floor so you never feel safe no matter how good your defenses are.   The game has one major flaw and that's the horrible servers. The servers are way too unpredictable. At one moment they work fine, the other they won't give you any money or won't even load you to the game. Ubisoft stated that they are working on fixing this issue so I trust them to get it sorted out.  The game is optimised incredibly well. It runs at 60 fps maxed out. If you have a high end PC you will have no trouble running this game.  In the end do I recommend the game ? Yes I do. I do suggest at the very least waiting for the server issue to be fixed and you have one of the best squad based games ever made. Get a few friends for the ride and you have one incredible game on your hands.  Final Rating: 9/10 - A must own (after servers are fixed)  If you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments on what you disliked about the review.

Theres some underpowered characters, some overpowered ones (that stupid rifle shield and it's free peeks i swear to god), but they're working on it, so that's good. The whole 'free content for everyone' approach is also great, hard to believe it's in a Ubisoft™ game.  Two issues it does suffer from are crappy netcode and the matchmaking. Sure I'm silver, but that doesn't warrant placing a level 41 against a level 170, even if he's also silver.  If you're into competitive FPSs, this is a great tactical one. If the Starter Edition comes up again, don't even waste time pondering it and jump on the Siege train. Great waste of 15€.  Update: They actually patched the game recently, adding a little more content and most importantly: fixing the underpowered and overpowered ops, just like the community had been asking.

            "review_text": "UPDATED REVIEW (Andjusted Review for BLACK ICE UPDATE!)  I've put many more hours and was finally able to play ranked matches since my last uninformed review. So here's my stance on the game right now: ♥♥♥♥ing Fantastic, for the most part anyway.  This game has everything it needs to grow a reliable and consistent playerbase. Rainbow Six Siege's asymmetric style of gameplay is unique, and it seems very fresh. This arena shooter pits two teams of 5 operators against each other in intense extremely close quarters combat. The environment could be either your biggest ally or your worst enemy, depending on which team you're on or how your team's been handling a situation. While I think this game is great I cannot argue that it has some issues. Here are simple pros and cons to wet your appetite for destruction.  PROS:  - Fantastic destruction based gameplay forces you to think and adapt to any situation.  - Has serious competitive potential. Ranked mode is good, but obviously the people playing for keeps aren't so nice. Ever.  - SO MANY OPERATORS!  CONS:  - Microphone communication is a must. Text chat is limited to less than 6 words, making communication difficult for those who are either afraid to talk to people, or don't have a microphone. Sometimes, people don't even talk. At all. This makes the game unwinnable a lot. (EDIT: UBISOFT HAS EXPANDED THE AMOUNT OF LETTERS IN TEXT CHAT SIGNIFICANTLY, DISREGARD)  - The community is very hit or miss at best. One can play 10-12 games and only 2 out of those 10-12 would be good, fair, non ♥♥♥♥♥y teammates who take responsibility for their shortcomings instead of blaming the rest of the team. Blaming the rest of the team is only okay if the rest of the team is actually to blame, which is often not the case.  - Matchmaking seems to enjoy hooking people up globally. Which means that damn language barrier strikes again.  - Terrorist hunt. My darling Terrorist hunt what have they done to you... Classic Terrorist Hunt mode is a rarity at best when Ubisoft decided it would be a good idea to just shoehorn in other game modes. And they're terrible.  Overall, Rainbow Six Siege is a great team based game if you have a mic, patience, and good sportsmanship. So grab a corner, make yourself comfortable, and pray to god the enemy team doesn't have Thermite.  7/10  P.S.: The reviews angelizing the community are incredibly situational and subjective. Those reviewers got lucky and got matched up with great players. I never do. Don't buy the game based on the community because you will be thoroughly disappointed.  BLACK ICE UPDATE: Oh Ubisoft. You make me so happy but also so, so mad. Black Ice is the first official content update of R6 Siege and it looks promising. It adds a new map and two new operators. It was released on Feb 2nd, but I can't access the content until the 8th... what the hell Ubisoft. They are pushing this season pass HARD.  I considered lowering the score and giving the game a thumbs down but hell. Every AAA company pushes their season passes so who cares. I can wait a tad longer. I am glad that I get access to the balance update at least. And boy what a hefty balance update it is. Also I found it hilarious to see that Ubisoft still has a sense of humor.   Thatcher finally got his shotgun. Thanks, Ubi.",

As someone with over 900hrs on CSGO and having played it since 1.6 I can say that depth is relevant. People play dust 2 all day long year in year out without becoming bored because it is the human adversary that adds depth and continual change to approach every round.   This game has a multitude of option on operators that arent merely skins but offer different ways to achieve victory that suit your approach. EG wanna bust through the front door then take a meat shield and let your team walk in behind you. There are so many options on entry poitns that every match is significantly different.  This is a great game that deserves your attention if you enjoy team fps games that require a little bit of planning each round. The graphics are not mind blowing but serve to allow a large diversity of gamers access which is only going to give the game a longer shelf life. The sound is amazing with headphones and using sounds are paramount to victory.  It took a little bit of fiddling to get the game running the way i like in terms of FPS and look etc but otherwise the servers have been great and as an Aussie im getting 35ms and yet to have trouble getting a game under 20 secs.  I hope this helps you to make a decision but at the very worst you can get a refund using steam support if you dont like it. Cheers.",

My personal strategies evolve as I play, when I die sometimes it means my strategy needs adjusting, or there is a vulnurability I need to be aware of. Other times I rage quit. But when it all comes together... it's very satisfying.  At first I was annoyed that you had to unlock operators, but I realized that each one has a bit of a learning curve, so by the time you play with one for a while you can unlock the next one, not really a big deal. It's also good to know if you have a more expensive operator on your team, it's probably someone experienced, so you might want to stick with them.  I guess my only complaint is the 'peekers advantage'. If you peek around a corner you can shoot someone before they even see you (by a fraction of a second). This actualy gives an advantage to players with a high ping. I get that this is a technical limitation, but it does force me to defend as a roamer instead of camping in the objective room (which would be fun).",

I had the feeling that this game would flop, lacking content and any form of charm. I kept a speck of determination in me that maybe, just maybe, Rainbow Six Siege will turn out alright, but I knew it was going to fail.'   I was proven wrong. Rainbow Six: Siege is a solid title and can provide a fair amount of entertainment. It's a breath of fresh air in an age where first person shooters are all fast-paced mainstream games, like Call of Duty. Despite all of this, I feel like the game is missing something that can 'wow' me, something that makes it feel like a truly special game.   Graphics",

            "review_text": "If you enjoy Rainbow Six series then I am sure you might enjoy this one, but only just I would say.  The game has changed in many ways and I do have a problem with the game, which I will get into in a moment.  Graphics: The graphics are obviously updated since any other Rainbow Six game, which is good but they are not as amazing as we would like them too be. They are pretty decent still to say, but that's about it. I do not expect much because of this, the graphics are just a modern game at that....   Audio: The audio I find to be louder than what it is, when shooting a gun it sounds like a rocket is going BANG in your ear, no matter inside or out and feels rushed together just to make it sound like something is happening, rather than the game actually sounding like a firing weapon in a small space, outside or in a large room... Slightly annoying or confusing at times.  Controls: The controlling of the character is very easy to get ahold and kinda more arcade style movement than originally thought... It feels more of a slowed down Counter Strike movement, not quiet the arcade CS controls but a slower version to make it seem more realistic. The buttons and stuff are easy to do and get used too..  Game: The game itself right now on release as I write this article (I will update after the first year so people better understand how it has moved along) is that it has 3 modes, multiplayer/ Terrorist Hunt and kinda like scenario situations, where there are about 8 missions, you must gain 3 stars in each mission to basically pass, each mission is a different thing BUT it feels like a tutorial for each class and how to use and play as them, mixed in the 3 star system from the old Modern Warfare 2 coop system, where you had to defend for X amount of time for 3 stars etc (If you played MW2 coop, you will know about the star coop system)  Terrorist Hunt has 3 difficulties, Normal, Hard and Realistic... Basically realistic is hacking bots, this I seen being stupid... I watched my death cam, a bot instantly stepped into a room looking right and did not see my team, then INSTANTLY span directly to the left almost a 360 degree spin pin point accuracy, fired and killed 2 people... Stupid. Basically you hunt the map to kill how ever many bots... That is terrorist hunt.  The games you play as multiplayer are fast at times but thankfully the loading is almost instant, so you are in and out without any massive waiting so games are always on the go, which is a plus when you have a stupid team and the other being pro's.  My annoyance and many feel the same: The game has a kinda cash system, where you give Ubisoft MORE money than they already recieve, in return you buy ingame cash and use that cash to pay for items in the game like more operators, gun attachments, skins and so on... The game itself is built around this and you earn a small amount of renown ingame gold stuff to actually buy stuff, this I noticed to be a lot of playing (farming) to get the gold you need to upgrade, when you could just spend more money on a game with limited gameplay and get the stuff you want straight away. You can now buy items with renown but some items are locked behind the real money system like boosts or packs etc. Also items are very very very expensive with renown!  The game was delayed once or twice, I cannot remember.. It might have been more but I played the closed beta, open beta and so on and between those times I cannot see why the game took so long to make. It barely has any content to keep someone playing for hours and barely has anything to warrant the huge price tag they want for it... Ubisoft for you I guess.   The game on release has barely any content I found... The maps, modes and whatever else is barely anything for what I would expect a bran new game to have.   Would I recommend the game? Yes and no, sadly Steam does not allow this option for limo.  Yes, if you enjoy the Rainbow Six Series and like team work, small maps, quick games, weird shooting to rescue a hostage, or defuse a bomb and secure the area (Basically a bomb but no defuser) (Seriously that's the only three options.....)  No, if you do not like barely any content, cash ingame microtransactions system and medicore experience.  Ubisoft needs to do some major work on this game and release a hell load of free stuff and stuff for gold edition to make this game something that it was supposed to be, the game had so much hype on what it was going to be but utterly it falls short by quiet a bit which is sad. I wanted to love thie game but ended up more frustrated than anything else. Ubisoft also seems to be turning into a company which throws anything together with a slapping big price tag and thinks it's justified with their name, it's worth it all and it's amazing...",

It's addictive and dynamic enough that you don't get bored of playing the same maps and game modes over and over; every round will play out a little differently.   With that being said, I have a couple points of criticism:  1. The matchmaking system sucks. I wish it didn't, but it's my main problem with the game. One of the problems is it will begin searching for an opposing team prematurely before filling up your team roster, perhaps in anticipation that it can find the remaining players while it matches you up with the opposition, but more often than not it gets stuck in a loop of finding teammates to looking for an enemy team, and the only way out of it is to quit matchmaking and reenter the queue. Other times, it will continue searching for teammates after the roster is already full instead of for an enemy team, or it will continuously loop between searching for teammates and finding an enemy team for no apparent reason even after the roster is full.   As a result of these problems, you either spend over five minutes queuing or have to quit and rejoin the queue. It may seem like a trivial amount of time but it adds up quickly and is genuinely irritating. Aside from that, there doesn't seem to be much rhyme or reason to who you get matched up with or against, especially in ranked. I've seen level 40s get paired with people over level 100, and bronze tier players get pitted against a team of silver tier players. Frankly it results in the same sort of 'ELO hell' that players complain about in games like League of Legends, and needs fixed, especially for the ranked system.   2. There's a major lack of player statistics, both for yourself and other players. For a game that's basically multiplayer only, I'd expect it to maintain some record of things (comparable to say, Battlefield) like K/D ratio, win/loss ratio, score per minute, most played classes and weapons, accuracy %, etc. I've only been able to find very rudimentary stats for ranked games only, which doens't really help a player to reflect on their performance. In searching for people to play with in multiplayer, it would help to have these stats available to be able to better predict their performance.  3. Network lag. Too many times have I gotten killed from around a corner by someone that wasn't there when I was peaking. The kill cam shows a much different view than I had. Accomodating for potential lag when peaking is basically part of the game at this point, and I have a pretty stellar internet connection it's pretty annoying. Another fix needed here.  With all that being said, and I may come across as rather harsh, I still love this game to death and play every day. I hope that these problems are addressed in future updates.",

What team comp you use is also very important if you want to be succesful in this game, let's say that the enemy team got the two riot shield classes, Then it is a good idea to have class there can have C4 or toxic gas, Else you will have to flank them which isn't always possible.

This game is wonderful, it's the first fps game I've ever played where tactics and knowledge over your enemy actually matter. The gun play is very rewarding and more than memorable and the hit box on enemies is so fine tuned you actually have to hit them to do damage (none of that Call of Duty ♥♥♥♥). Headshots are instant kills no matter what gun it is which is far more realistic than in some games where a 50cal to the skull doesn't even phase you but knife to the foot ♥♥♥♥s you up instantly (looking at you again Call of Duty). Anyway this review isn't to bash another game for not being like this one. Call of Duty is good in it's own right. But if you want a real tactical experience that will probably annoy you until you get the hang of it then this is a game for you. I highly recommend this game as it has quickly became one of my favorites on Steam over the past months it has been out",

Everyone here is very nice and talkative. I have made a bunch of friends through this game, and its great!   Lots of games say 'this is very team based and communication is the only way you can win.' And generally, thats not 100% true, as you can usually get by just fine without saying anything. This game actually seriously benefits from talking. Especially if the whole team has mics.   The best thing about this game is obviously the destruction, and all the cool gadjets that the operators get. Very unique and creative. Talking with your team and pulling off some good plays is really where the game comes together. When you all breach at the same time, or surprise the enemy team and wipe them out fast. Its those moments that make this game what it is. Its that feeling of talking and having fun with people. And laughing about random stuff, and winning games, with total strangers. Thats an amazing thing to have in a game. And this game pulls it off really well.  The only bad experiences I have had are some netcode issues and crazy load times. The netcode issues are very rare for me, only happened about 3 times in 50 hours of playing. And sometimes I would take a ridiculous amount of time to load, most of the times it works great though.  I think this is one of my favorite games. I can see myself playing it for a long time, and if they make one, I would totally buy a sequel.

The attackers are required to secure or capture an objective such as a hostage or biohazard/bomb while the defence team set up barricades and traps to stop them. There are also 20 operators to play from, each with unique abilities and weapons that can be used in many different situations as well as there being dedicated attack and defend operators.   There are also three gamemodes and they each use this playstyle. There is competitive multiplayer, terrorist hunt (player vs AI) and situations (singleplayer). The singleplayer is used to put you into many different scenarios involving hostages, biohazards and bombs to use different operators and abilities to win. You can earn stars for completing specific goals in each situations which also earn you renown points, the in-game currency used to purchase operators. Terrorist Hunt involves a team of players fighting their way to the objective through AI bots, the cooperative component.   The positives: - Really fun. - Very good looking graphics. - Creative use of tools, gadgets and weaponry they are fun to use and play.  - A different variety of operators to choose from. - Additional operators and maps added through free DLC.  The negatives: - Other players can be offputting and abusive (teamkilling, swearing etc.) - The banning system could use a lot of work (which is getting better gradually) - Players decide to report you for no reason just to be annoying.  I have personally really enjoyed playing this and have had so much fun with a different experience everytime I play being able to choose from many different operators adding plenty of variety. The visuals are very pleasing to look at and the tactical gameplay is amazing. I recommend this game if you can put up with annoying players as apart from that it is a really good experience.

You defend or plant the bomb, or protect, rescue hostage. Neather these game modes rarely end up actual completing the mission. They're mostly all ending up wiping the whole oppisite squad. This game is 'THE MANLY VERSION OF CS' = More firepower, better sound environments (Footsteps behing the wall etc.) and so on.. And dont forget those noobs who shoot you in the back cause they've iching figers or are hair-triggered lunatics. One mistake with the shotgun and your teammate is gone. That's that. Cons are said.  There's gonna be 28 operatives (classes) in the game. TOTAL. Thats too damn awesome. Too much to choise once you have bought all of them. Season classes can be bought an Ingame or real money, but base classes (20 operatives) are purchasable only in ingame current. You play more, you get more.  I recommend this game to all ppl who actual like tactical based shooters. No, this is not like COD or BF.. It's different and respect that. Give it a try. It wont hurt you unless you run all out of money. Thou It wont cost much.  Sry my english is bad and i'm drunk as ♥♥♥♥.. ",

I mean, I love smokescreens, but when I have tried 8 - 9 times to join one server and all I get is a loading smokescreen, it kind of gets annoying.  Another awesome mini game which is included is called 'getting mugged simulator'. If you survive past the smokescreen simulator, there is in fact another 60% chance of all of the hundreds of points you earn during each game, actually get taken straight off of you. So Ubisoft, you've mad a fantastic game with some incredible mini games - or shall I saw AWFUL FLAWS.

The shooting feels great, heavy and destructive. The somewhat limited content is constantly being added to. I think a new map is due Monday for example. The sound design is very cool, forget sprinting up to opponents to knife them, unless the situation calls for a bit of a melee with your opponent they will just blow off your stupid, cod-loving dome if you do this due to the loud sound it generates and brutality of bullet damage. It's best played with friends but you probably already knew that. Randoms are more communicative than most games and you can ping and type team chat if you are allergic to talking to people online. But most matches at least one person is willing to voice comms.

I've never played one second of any previous Rainbow Six game before and I am sad because I now know what I was missing. Competetive FPS's I played in the past were Call of Duty and Battlefield which are different to each other and especially different to Rainbow Six Siege. Rainbow Six Siege really rewards strategy, patience and accuracy in spades. You can't just go in guns blazin' and expect to succeed. This is especially true in multiplayer. You have to scope out your enemy and plan on how to infiltrate or defend the building. There are 26 operators (13 on offense and 13 on defense) all with different abilities and uses. It's important to know the strengths and weaknesses of the operator you're currently using and to use their specialties to their maximum effectiveness. What I love about this game is that if you die once, you're out until the next round. One minor screw up or victory has a bigger impact on the outcome of the match. Siege has Co-op as well and can definitely be very fun either with randoms, friends or lone wolf, but the real draw and addictivness of the game comes from out smarting and out maneuvering the enemy team in multiplayer. In CoD and BF, it's definitely satisfying to get a kill, but a kill in Siege is so much more rewarding and special. There are no kill streaks and crazy battles. There are just 2 small groups of tactical soldiers that have small skirmishes in a building, and it's exhilerating and suspenseful as hell.",

Cons  - Only the lack of gamemodes, secure the area, secure the hostage, and defuse the bomb are different styles, but they all lead into a team trying to defend the area from the attacking team, but the game is still totally rad.

The game is made in such a way that rushing and trolling isn't really viable because you will just die. There's no way for them to get satisfaction.  Two downsides. One big, one small. The big one is the servers. Good god Ubisoft. it's like their servers are just a bunch of monkeys playing with abacusses. The small one is the shield.   In the end. I say buy the game.

Graphics are great, Gameplay is amazing, Operators are great, and the game itself is just the best FPS hands down. The only thing that could potentially make it better would be a good story that would satisfy all of the players who want a single player campaign.

Few problems with the game: 1. Limbs sometimes go through walls. 2. Some times in the death cam i feel like half the shots don't actually hit me.  I haven't played the game much so i dont find very much problems with the game.  Things i recommend in the game: 1. A modding system for custom games. 2. A stamina bar for a more realistic feel. 3. Being able to pick up dead people's weapons. 4. More weapons. (Ubisoft might be working on some more.) 5. More Operators. (I think more are coming.) 6. More Maps/Gamemodes. For example: Normal DeathMatch. I think a destroyed city would be a cool map. 7. Campaign/Story Mode/SinglePlayer. 8. A customable Operator. 9. For BlackBeard: The ability to give the bullet shield to someone else on the team. 10. For all the Shield Operators: Give the shield the ability to ACTUALLY WORK! (I feel like the shield doesn't work very well.)  Thats it. May have missed some.  Welp, hoped my review helped you.  Tip: Use drones to your advantage in battle.  ",

What else could this game possibly offer?  Well.  Not only do you get the base game, but you also get a 'smokescreen simulator' when you join 80% of the servers. I mean, I love smokescreens, but when I have tried 8 - 9 times to join one server and all I get is a loading smokescreen, it kind of gets annoying.  Another awesome mini game which is included is called 'getting mugged simulator'. If you survive past the smokescreen simulator, there is in fact another 60% chance of all of the hundreds of points you earn during each game, actually get taken straight off of you. So Ubisoft, you've mad a fantastic game with some incredible mini games - or shall I saw AWFUL FLAWS.   If you fancy playing a game for 10 hours - 7 of which are loading screens AND THEN getting mugged off for points - this game is for you.",

However, I have ran into many 'problems' with the game in the hours I have played it and would love some sort of 'fix' for them. The first one is with the servers of course. Me trying to play with my friends find myself struggling to connect to the squad or one of them trying to connect aswell. It just never seems to to run smoothly. Also touching on the squads exiting out of a game with your squad also kicks you from the quad i would like to see you stay in your squad even if you are kicked aswell. Another annoyance is with the host leaving the game. instead of the resoution call of duty came up which migrates the host to another person or the servers themselfs hosting the game, seige hasnt figuered out how to keep a game running if the host leaves. Kicking everyone out the game and resulting in no reward. Another huge annoyance is it always being online. Me living in the UK does not have a reliable connection and in result will be randomly kicked from a game for having a lag spike. ( thats not a bother for me as im used to it) what bothers me about this is it kicks me from the game completely not alowing me to play a solo terrorist hunt or anything that is singleplayer in the game. There is a few other nippicky things which i wont bother about but I still enjoy the game keeps with the rainbow six franchise well enough for it to have a rainbow six title but dont go into the game thinking it will be like R6 vegas cause u will be disapointed a little",

Some times the servers take up to 10 minutes to load and a lot of times i'm pressing ALT+f4.  The operators are not balanced what so ever. If you know how to be effective with these characters it's ok but when a level 17 or someone near that level plays as IQ or Tachanka I always find my team being set back because of them not being effective with the character and the character itself isn't effective. Whenever this happens it feels as if I'm playing with 4 team mates instead of 5.  These are my main concerns with the game. I know that I only have 44.2 hours on record and I may not have noticed as many issues, bugs, exploits as other players with more hours on record but this is what I've noticed that actually matter (in my opinion).

I already have around 100 hours in the game and still EVERY SINGLE GAME feels different. The graphics are good, the sound is good, the destruction is FREAKING AMAZING and the different strategies, tactics are what makes the game unique. Other multiplayer shooters released this year (Even though i didn't play every single one but I did play most like black ops III, Battlefront etc...) are not even close to this game. One last thing, this game is also set apart from other shooters because of it's focus on teamwork and strategy then shooting and spray patterns like (Cs:Go) I also bought Cs:Go this year and this game is MUCH better in my opinion.",

            "review_text": "This game has so many pros and only one to two cons. There is so much diversity in this game every person can find an operator that suits their play style the best. I have never played a round in almost 500 hours that played the same as another. The only con in this game is the servers, which are not as bad as everyone says. The only other con is the lighting for looking outside as a defender, sometimes it is insanely bright and other times it is fine.  Firstly, every single operator has a different playstyle. Thermite, Hibana, ash, and sledge are all about destroying walls, floors, and ceilings. However, they do it in their own special way; Thermite makes a giant hole in reinforced walls/floors that your team can go through, Ash can blow open wooden barricade, placable shields, floor panels from a distance with her Breaching Rounds (And they aren't blocked by mute), Hibana is like a mix between Ash and Thermite she can open small holes in reinforced that you can look through but not walk through (You can make the holes on the bottom and crawl though), and Sledge uses his sledge hammer to breach holes in wooden wall, floors, and castle +mute barricades. These are just a few operators that the attackers can have; they can have Thatcher who can destroy electronics with his EMP grenade, Fuze who can fill a room with grenade with his cluster charge, IQ who can find find electronics through walls, and Many more fun and unique characters to play.  Defenders also have unique characters who all have different gadgets and play styles. Rook is the ultimate defended operator, his gadget is armor plating that him and his teammates can pick up (Armor makes it harder for attackers to kill you and your team). Jager can place down an ADS (also know as Active Defense System) which shoots down grenades the come into its range. Mute can jam wireless electronics (Which include breaching charges, thermite charge, and drones). Bandit is similar to mute, however, Bandit destroys the electronics (However the batteries must be placed on metal objects like reinforced walls, deployable shields, and barbed wire)   Secondly, Even after 500 hours of play since release of this game I have never played a similar round. Even with only about a dozen maps and 3 games modes no round is ever the same. Every time you go into a new round there is always a trick someone pulls that wins the round. Even when you play against the same people who are playing the same characters while your team is playing the same characters on the same game mode and same objective room as the last time the round will be different from the last one. If the attackers lost they will definitely try and new attacking strategy, however the defenders will know this and change how the defend the area and where they are hiding within the map. There are always new holes you kind find to shoot thought, I have played these maps over and over so many times but I still find new holes I can make to get easy kills.   Lastly, and sadly the only con in this game I can find are the servers. The servers and hitreg in this game can be horrible at times. They can be absolutely game breaking. I have lost countless rounds because the servers do not detect the headshot I got on an enemy, however, I won many rounds for the same reason (Even though I won the round I still felt like I was cheated out of a fair game).   The only other con is the lighting. The lighting is much better than the servers, but they are still hit and miss at times. Sometimes the lights look like the sun is 2 feet from the window and other times it works like intended. (One map is especially bad, Yacht, as it is covered in snow and the lighting is insanely bad. At times you are inside looking up a set of stairs that are inside and still be blinded by light)   Even in this review I wasn't able to talk about the amount of love put into this game by Ubisoft. an entire year of update and 4 DLC patchs this game is still my favorite to play. I know everyone just read that Ubisoft and 4 DLCs and groaned a little on the inside, but these DLCs are completely free to everyone (But you can still buy a pass that lets you play the new character a week before everyone else). The developers constantly give love to this game with constant updates that improve the game every time.   I can honestly say this is my favorite game I have ever played. Even after a year of playing I never get tried of booting up to play a few rounds. I can honestly say I have never been happier than when a new DLC is announced and when year 2 of DLC was announced I was insanely happy that this game survived has survived this long (And is growing). Even after a year after is release I would still recommend this game to anyone who wants a tactical teambased FPS.  TL;DR Even after a year game is going strong with new updates every couple months with FREE DLC every 3 moths. Every character is unique and fun to play. Strong tactical teambased FPS  10/10 would praise Chanka again",

In addition, the gadgets the different operators provide are all nice resembles of options and routes you can take in the modern tactical close quatars combat, while providing balanced gameplay between the defenders and the attackers. All in all, a great FPS game if you enjoy tactical based combats, having a nice time with friends, and learning about keys to sucess in gun fights (in general).

One team breaches, one team defends which switches during the round. Alot of options in the form of different characters: one can breach reinforced walls for example, that can only be reinforced by the defenders and cannot be breached otherwise. Another one can place tripwire mines (on the defending team) and another one can place extra cameras around the map... and so on. It has an insane amount of tactical depth and skillcap which leaves you playing and playing. It can be pretty hardcore for beginners, since you can die quickly if you do an error, but that makes it even more rewarding if you get it right.  A downside could be Uplay, which works without error for me (always has) but can turn some people down and some rare server problems.  I cannot recommend it enough.",

            "review_text": "If you are planning on purchasing the game, here are a few things you should know:  This game is almost exclusively multiplayer, though it does contain 10 Single Player scenarios called 'Situations'. You will have to register on UPlay, and everything ingame will be linked to your UPlay account, NOT your Steam account. You are simply purchasing the product via Steam. The game has a slight difficulty curve, and several of the tactics and strategies involved, you are expected to learn on your own, since there is very little Single Player content, and you jump straight into Multiplayer.  The game contains in-game microtransactions, for unlocking operators, weapon attachments and in game cosmetics. These can be purchased either using premium R6S credits or Renown earned in-game. The pricing is such that you should be done unlocking your operators and attachments very fast, and the only real grind is for getting cosmetics and DLC operators. The game has a 'Season Pass' system. You can purchase Year 2 Pass currently, and a Legacy operator bundle for getting the season 1 content. What a Season Pass does is allow you to unlock all DLC operators for free and use them 1 week prior to others being able to. Even if you don't own a Season Pass you can still get these operators, you just have to grind enough Renown points for them (25k for each operator ~ 15-20 hours). So in that sense, once you purchase the base game, you are able to access all the content for no extra charge, which is great because Ubisoft is still adding new content and supporting the game. The season pass also comes with added benefits such as Renown Booster, extra credits, Store Discounts, exclusive skins etc and in my opinion is worth it if you have the money.    The game does contain some bugs related to hit registration and this annoying problem that happens when you look out of a window and you can't see anything. But these are being worked on, and there have been improvements in the recent patch, and since there has been another year of content promised, we can expect these to be fixed. The matchmaking system is also a pain in the ♥♥♥ for Lower Level players since you almost always get teamed up and against higher level people, which is frustrating for both parties. However, this gets better once you learn the game and get at a higher level. There is also a Ranked match system where you get various tiers based on your skill level.    Overall, at this price I believe this game has offered my my money's worth. If the concept of such an FPS interests you, and you are tired of the same repetitive type 'Run and gun' gameplay of CoD, I'd say give this a shot.",

            "review_text": "Competitive games are a big business these days with thousands of people watching their favorite pro teams or players battling it out in their favorite games. Ubisoft never really had a game to attempt to compete with the competitive game scene. So now they made their first attempt by bringing Rainbow Six Siege. Here are my thoughts about Rainbow Six Siege.   The Story   This is gonna be a short one. There basically isn't any story mode in Rainbow Six Siege. You do see an intro about some unknown terrorist organization planning attacks around the world. But it is unclear why they even planning these attacks.  In the game itself there is no singleplayer story mode. Ubisoft stated that the focus on Rainbow Six Siege was mainly on compelling cooperative and multiplayer experience. It does however has singleplayer terrorist hunt and training missions. Which let you get familiar with the different operators to choose from. So what more does Rainbow Six Siege has to offer?   Terrorist Hunt   In terrorist hunt you play different missions on either normal, hard or realistic difficulty with either friends or random people versus a.i. controlled enemies. These missions are almost the same as the multiplayer. But the difference is that in terrorist hunt more enemies will swarm around since they are a.i. controlled enemies. But don't let their appearance fool you. These a.i. enemies will literally break down doors and windows to hunt you down. Or even blow themselves up while taking you with them.   Multiplayer   The multiplayer in Rainbow Six Siege is the cream of the crop. In the multiplayer you have the attacking and defending side. The attacking side has to either rescue a hostage, defuse a bomb or capture a bomb side while the defending side had to prevent it.  At the start of a match you pick one of the twenty-six operators depending on if you are attacking or defending. All these operators needs to be unlocked by earning renown that you earn by playing the game.  When everyone has picked their operator the 45 seconds preparation timer is starting. Within this time the attacking team needs to locate the objective and find the defending team.  The defending team however has to prepare for the coming attack. They can do this by reinforce walls so they can't be breached, setting up traps and get in position for the attack.  After the preparation timer it time to start the siege. At this point the round has 4 minutes left for the both teams to eliminate or secure the objective.  But what makes the gameplay so great is that every around feels like a problem solving game. Most of the times you really need to plan how you want to breach in a building. One big part of the problem solving is what operator did you picked to breach.  For instance on the attacking side the operator Termite is has two Exothermic charges which lets you breach reinforced walls. Termite is only one of the two operators able to blow up reinforced walls. Which makes him useful to create a new path.  But if we look at the defending side there is the operator Mute that can place signal disrupter's. And if placed at reinforced wall Termite cant use his Exothermic charge anymore until the signal disrupter is destroyed.  Its basically feels like a rock, paper and scissors game.  This is what I like the most about Rainbow Six Siege. It's satisfying to play a game with slow paced teamwork. And the feeling that very round feels different and unpredictable makes it great.   Season Pass   Yes, almost every game these days has a season pass and Rainbow Six Siege isn't any different. But it is important to mention that the season pass of Rainbow Six Siege is different as most other games.  Because you don't need the season pass to play new maps or new released operators. They are being released for free for everyone to play.  The thing season pass owners get is some exclusive skins, instantly unlock new operators and get a week early play time with these new operators.  But all the new maps are free for everyone to enjoy. And the new operators can be unlocked by renown by everyone with renown.  Final Verdict  Are you looking for a bit slower paced shooter and thinking a bit more strategic before rushing in a building with enemies. Than you should definitely try this game out.   I give Rainbow Six Siege a 8,5 out of 10 ",

As the defending team you are to prevent the attackers from getting to and securing the objective. you have various tools at your disposal. from wall/door barricades to traps and barbed wire. to slow them down and create choke points. As the attackers its the good ol breach and clear like the rainbow six we know and love.  There are a good number of operaters to choose from each with their own unique gadget. Even if a gadget seems OP theres always another to counter it.  the gunplay and damge is similar to insurgencey. except there is a hud and hit markers etc.. although i noticed the shotguns aren't very effective. theres been multiple times where it took 2 or even 3 shots point blank to kill a person. but headshots with any gun take 1 shot.  Unfortunatly this is a ubisoft game and the servers suuuuck. there is plenty of lag to go around and you will rubber band A LOT preventing you from entering doors. If i blow a hole in a wall big enough to go through i rubber band back through it every time... wtf... If you don't have the greatest connection i would avoid the game all together.the loading will be insane and from what i see and hear the game will start before you can even pick an operator or the entire lobby will be stuck loading until your computer catches up. resulting in the already abundance ♥♥♥♥ talk and calling your computer a potato.  Teamwork and communication are key. except you're dealing with a community you would find in any shooter. So there is little teamwork and the majority of the communication is ♥♥♥♥ talk and people ready to call anyone a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ or ♥♥♥♥♥♥ as soon as anyone opens their mouth. I would recommend playing with friends.  The only reason i give this a thumbs up is because the game itself is very good. But the server stability and community pretty much drove this title in the ground for me.... uninstalling...   Oh and theres and issue where what you're doing and see on your screen doesn't always match up to the other team. For example: I'll just barely be looking into a window but on the other end im actually right dab in the middle of the window right in the open (no its not my connection) I've seen it happen to other players and the other team confirmed it.",

All the operators are excellent, if you use them well. I recommend this game for many reasons. -The first one is that you can, as I said destroy a very big part of the map. -The second is that the maps are more complex than for example CSGO (position of cams, hatches,etc) -The third one is that this is an FPS not like the other ones because you need a lot more strategy to success. It's not recommended to rush ennemy. You can be flancked at almost any moment. Use cams, drones, learn maps and you'll be rewarded. - And the last one is that you can custom your weapons as you like it. Scopes, barrel attachments, cross, skins, charms... Finally, I'd say that this masterpiece is beautiful. Graphics are extraordinary (except sometimes some glitchs in the killcams) Buy this game. The success is 'Bigger than Ever'",

Often times servers are done and you can't play the game, and it takes a while before Ubisoft fixes bugs in the game.   The upside however is it's a unique game. Not very tactical, but it's quite fun. As you play the game you get in-game currency that you use to buy officers &amp; different upgrades for that specific officers gun. Each officer has their own unique abillity. One of the officers in the game Sledge, has a sledge hammer used to destroying things in one hit such as a wall or barricaded window..

I chose Thermite and I'm glad I did. I brake through a window and see reinforced walls all over the place. I smile and set my special charge. One wall is down and I can hear them running around and repositioning. I let my team know.  I quickly place another Thermite's special on the opposite wall (just to stir even more panic) and I hide. The wall melts and explodes. I throw my grenades which destroy 3 of their devices. Unfortunately, no kills for me.  I hear Fuze's special grenades: great effect on target and 2 enemies down. As Blitz makes his way in hiding behind his shield, Montagne (I didn't even remember he was there) walks slowly with his shield from head to toe. I hitch a ride and we advance as one.  The enemy manages to kill Fuze. Blitz also falls, but not before blinding one of them and making him an easy pray for Montagne, who promptly hides behind his fortress again as soon as he's done getting revenge for our team.  Sledge finishes the job skillfully: he sets the defuser after killing an enemy. Now there's one tango left, so we just wait. He must do something or he will let his teammates down for not even trying. He comes, I try to kill him and I die. Montagne doesn't.  We win. We cheer and praise eachother. I add some of the players to my buddy list.  As for me, I had no kills or assists, but the 'doors' I opened (and only I could open them) paved our way to success.

TLDR: Recommend if on sale. Not recommending purchasing Season Pass, unless you're a die-hard Rainbow Six fan.   I'll make this quick by making a statement and why:   PROS:  -Graphics is great. When something goes boom, you see particles off the wall. -Weapons are balanced (in my opinion). Each weapon has their own time to shine in a certain map. -Operators are balanced (in my opinion). Same reasoning with weapons. -Not a pay-to-win. Skins are buyable, but most could be unlocked through in-game currency. -Teamwork Reliant. You go alone, you get downed alone and someone nice has to crawl through to you just to revive your ♥♥♥. -Customizable HUD for those 'Hardcore' players. Great if you want a good slap of realism and then realise you forgot to reload or ran out of explosives. -Immersive. Hear footsteps, shoot towards it. Hear Darth Vader coming, shoot it in the head. Hear 2 Darth Vaders coming, good luck. -Requires a bit of thinking.   Unlike Call of Duty.   -Great Community. We'll revive you even if you're half-across the map, as long as you're not a complete prick.   CONS:  -Hackers. No need for description. -Servers consists of potatoes. My decade-old toaster is more efficient. -'AFK Farmers' (especially) in Terrorist Hunt who just queue up until they're host and literally does nothing during the round. -Must have 5 players on both teams to start match. Can't opt to carry on with the match without 5th player. -Lack of a 'Story' mode. My opinion though. -Could use a bit more customization on weapons or armour. My opinion though.   Overall: 7/10 ",

I'm also not sure if they ever fixed those glitches where you can rappel off the map, tried to follow the bugs but they didn't seem to acknowledge them in the first place. The best part about the issues with the game is that it was $60 for a 1/4th finished game and not even a few weeks later they announced The Division for $60, which also had problems (not as bad since it wasn't an FPS).  All the BS aside, like I mentioned it seems they're finally fixing some of the main issues that was making the game unplayable IMO. The heroes/characters you get to choose from are pretty fun, unique-ish gameplay - my favorite part of the game is using the droids to race around and locate players. I still don't like to load it up much, as it's hard to find a good group of people and the level of frustration you get is beyond any Kaizo Mario level you could imagine. You're expected to know where the camera's are, or if someone made a hole in the wall, or the regular Glaz spots.  Great gift for a friend you want to passively torture.",

So basically this is a game where the premise is 2 teams, OPfor and BLUfor in which one team defends and objective while the other attempts to break into the compound/building using tools, as the defenders have a preparation time to use their tools to make a strong defense. the tools are class system based meaning the hero you choose will have certain situational uses, im sure there are some classes that are underpowered, i just havnt been able to use them all yet as i only have 4 so far, and out of those 4 the tools are pretty neat. weapon customization is pretty regular, they use a system where you buy weapon attatchments (no need to buy guns because weapon options are pre seleteced for your class, the 'currency' you use to buy the stuff with is easy because you get a ♥♥♥♥ load of it after you finish a game (especially if you did good) the game is also based around a leveloution type system as to MOST (not all) walls/interiors are able to be broken, as much as going down to a SINGLE BULLET can make a tiny hole the size of a bullet, i've personally never seen that attention to detail to leveloution in my experience before. the gunplay is honestly pretty generic but something about the leveloution and gunplay goes together like peanut butter and jelly and it feels right even with the generic gunplay, because the world (or building heh) you're in feels dynamic as most of it can be broken with guns/explosives i also personally like the gunsounds in this game, they sound meaty when they shoot but not trying to be hyper realistic in any way, feels just right. i honestly cant say much about map design yet because i have not been familiar with the maps enough yet. i also feel like this game is pretty easy to take on if your familiar with FPS games, as i took it on pretty quick and began rackin in kills. all in all so far its pretty fun",

I haven't had too much fun in random queues devoid of friends. I only really play with 1 or two friends max but that really does make the difference.   Pros: - Visually pleasing - Satisfying kills - Good community (For the most part) - Goofing around is very funny (Since its usually a pretty competitive atmosphere) - Not pay to win, only pay for small benefits. - Characters are well balanced (with maybe 1 exception) - Addictive   Cons: - Expected to learn quite a bit, this expectancy is held even in casual games. (map knowledge, objective strategies) - Peakers advantage (may vary), i dont know if this has to do with netcode or whatever, im not fimiliar with it. This is when a person peaks around the corener and kills you so fast it seems inhuman, however when watching the the kill replay he seemed to have all the time in the world.

It is a real gud expericene of painting weapons of destruction when you buy camos with dog tags that you unlock for killing the bad guys. Actually i'll give it a 8/10. I like it more than i thought. I remember one time i was killed by getting shot through the wall, i was really mad. But i got over it win we won the match and i got 500 dog tags. Oh by the way with the dog tags you can get characters that you kill terrorist or policemen with. They call them operators, but i call them people. My favorite is Rook. When the round starts all you have to do is press middle mouse button and drop some armor packs. They're great. Heh. That reminds me of frosted flakes, they are amazing with some sugar and milk.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Some of the main features we have in this game is situations, multiplayer and um terrorist hunter. My favorite is multiplayer, but let me tell you about situations. This gamemode is a single player option. The government pays you like 1000 dog tags to take out 20+ highly trained teenaged muslims, by yourself to save ONE person that doesnt even run away when the terrorist are no where near you. I'd say that is a awesome deal! Let's go on to the multiplayer. This is where your counter strike skills come into play. You become the good guys or the bad guys. I hate being the bad guys cuz it reminds me of ISIS. I hate ISIS. But multiplayer is fun when you have a full team with microphones and they know how to vault into windows. The last gamemode is terrorist hunt. This is when you are paid 1000 dog tags to killed highly trained teenage muslim terrorist holding ONE person as hostage, but with human people! I'd say i'll rather take my chances alone. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The overall game is a 8.5/10 I like it because i like counter strike and good graphics. If you think my review was helpful then i feel sorry for you. Good bye.",

As of 12.1.15 the only issue with the game was some connection / server issues which will be fixed very soon.  Game play is solid, gun play is solid, destruction is solid, winning a 1v5? SOLID. This is a very tactical game and feels very new in this water downed FPS market. Game is best played with Friends by far, this will give you and 4 other friends a chance to have great communication skills and work together to win the round / match. Just because you are a good shot does not mean you will win by any means. Sense this game is very tactical I would recommend having a headset w/ mic, Communication is key in this game. If you have a good plan and you can talk to your team about it then you and your team will be setup for success most everytime. The Devs talk about supporting this game for over a year releasing new maps, operators, guns, game modes, cosmetic items, events, ect.. This game has no single player but has a offline Terrorist Hunt mode with 5 or 6 diferent game types. It also has Scenarios which i have not tried yet but it is from what i understand is like single player missions just with out a full story. If you are a casual gamer they got you, if you are a competitive player they got you. This game is a must have if you are into FPS or want to get into a FPS that's not COD, BF, or CSGO.",

The community is cancerous to say the least. While it's not all bad, the vast majority of ranked games is either hackers or people who call hacks if they lose. Casual is even worse, where there aren't as many hackers, but holy ♥♥♥♥ is there cancer. Just every single match is salt and salt and salt. No one can just play the game for fun. Anyone you kill there's a 80% chance they'll accuse you of hacking. If every 1/10 player is a hacker, which is proabably accurate, the other 9/10 will be accused of hacking. Honestly me and my friends want to enjoy ourselves and this game, but we end up getting worked up and actually salt because we just want to have a fun time and everyone has to be the biggest autist for no reason. You won't notice this if you're in the early leagues, for a fair while the game is fun and against other low levels everyone's pretty chill. Once you go against high levels and ranked players, you start to see the cancer though. Do you enjoy this kind of game and can ignore the community? Get this game Do you enjoy this kind of game and can't stand this ♥♥♥♥? Get it if you have friends Do you enjoy this kind of game, can't stand this ♥♥♥♥, and have no one to play with? Can't say i'd recommend it.   Long story short,  Game: 6/10 alone, 7/10 with friends, needs a lot of work, by end of all dlc maybe a 7 or 8 alone/with friends.  Community? 0/10 awful, league of legends level. One of the most toxic and cancerous communities out there. And when i say toxic i don't mean Dunkey toxic.

Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege invites players to master the art of destruction. Intense close quarters confrontations, high lethality, tactics, team play, and explosive action are at the center of the experience. The gameplay sets a new bar for intense firefights and expert strategy in the rich legacy of past Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six games. Key Features THE SIEGE GAMEPLAY  For the first time in Rainbow Six, players will engage in sieges, a brand-new style of assault. Enemies now have the means to transform their environments into strongholds: they can trap, fortify, and create defensive systems to prevent breach by Rainbow teams.   To face this challenge, players have a level of freedom unrivaled by any previous Rainbow Six game. Combining tactical maps, observation drones, and a new rappel system, Rainbow teams have more options than ever before to plan, attack, and diffuse these situations.    COUNTER TERRORIST UNITS  Counter terrorist operatives are trained to handle extreme situations, such as hostage rescue, with surgical precision. As “short range” specialists, their training is concentrated on indoor environments. Operating in tight formations, they are experts of close quarter combat, demolition, and coordinated assaults. Rainbow Six Siege will include operators coming from five of the most worldwide renowned CTU: the British SAS, the American SWAT, the French GIGN, the German GSG9 and the Russian SPETSNAZ.   These Operators are specialists with their own expertise within Siege operations. Each has their own unique personality &amp; specialty. Some are focused on assault where as others are defense-oriented. They can be combined within the same team to create new team strategies.    PROCEDURAL DESTRUCTION  Destruction is at the heart of the siege gameplay. Players now have the unprecedented ability to destroy environments. Walls can be shattered, opening new lines of fire, and ceiling and floors can be breached, creating new access points. Everything in the environment reacts realistically, dynamically, and uniquely based on the size and caliber of bullets you are using or the amount of explosives you have set. In Rainbow Six Siege, destruction is meaningful and mastering it is often the key to victory.",

Even though it's from Ubi *cough* *WatchDogs* soft, the game is actually good, and this is coming from a player that has played ALOT of Battlefield, Call of duty, Arma, and Counter Strike. The game is very competitive, the shooting feels like Battlefield, but the feeling that the enemy could come from anywhere at anytime(destructible environments) is surprisingly very DayZ like. the competitive atmosphere is similar to CSGO, but it's better than CS in many aspects.   There is a greater emphasis in teamwork, in CS you can pretty much carry yourself and your friends to the higher ranks if you have good aim alone. Here in R6, aim will not save you. your teammates will, literally(through revives). But unliterally, there are classes to unlock and to choose from that can compliment/counter other classes. For example, in the defenders, you can place electricity to metal surfaces to keep away intruders which can be countered by another class(disabler of electronics) on the attacker side, kill that disabler class early in the game and they can't disable the electricity and in-turn destroy that wall, and they have less options to breach in. Grenades can be countered by an anti-grenade system, which can be disabled as well. Different classes have different abilities which can help your team win the round. You can select your loadout, and stuff your weapons with attachments depending on your preference.  There are a lot of maps, ranging from small to large, and every round, the position of the defending side is randomized(in casual, but in ranked your team can vote to choose one of many sites), and the attacking team have to find them, usually by the use of small drones. This is very different to CSGO where sites are fixed and chokepoints are the same over and over and over again. Again, we have destructible environments so pretty much the enemy can come from any side, especially if the place you are defending has a ceiling, basement and windows.  aside from the usual 5v5 casual/ranked PvP matches, there are single player missions to complete and the Terrorist Hunt COOP/lonewolf vs AI game mode like in Rainbow Six Vegas.  The only downside I can think of is the hackers, I haven't met one myself(mainly due to mostly playing casual atm) but I've heard the game is full of them. I've heard the game is buggy as well, but I haven't found any huge game breaking bugs atm.  9.5/10",

There is the tradional 5vs5 which is fun and competitive + the terroriste hunt (i love it) where 5 players fight against ai. and of course, free dlc ! this is so rare nowadays. The action in the game is great, i love to hear the gun fight, to see rooms blowing up, to think how im going to attack etc...

M&amp;K symbols are being displayed and the netcode is very stable. at least i personally had no issues what so ever. its a fun MP only team shooter were tactic and caution is required. can highly recommend it if you are fed up with COD and BF and want something less action driven but still full of tension with good people trying to be in a team to achieve the goal. no regrets paying full price for it.",

I didn't have time to play the open beta so I began to get concerned with all the negative reviews and comments about the game. I waited a couple days for some reviews to appear after release and reviews were positive (87%) when I pulled the trigger to buy it. I have never played CS so I can't compare but Siege is AWESOME! So you have to earn so renown to 'buy' your operators and accessories, big deal. It was good practice and after about 11 hours I am already up to unlocking 8 operators. Do I care that I don't have all of them open after paying $60...not one bit. It makes it fun and challenging for ME, and I enjoy playing the Situations alone. I do not have this entitlist attitude many seem to have and feel everything should be handed out without earning it. I earned and carefully picked my operators and enjoyed every second of it   I will be honest, I have only played a few hours with friends doing private squad play. It was a blast and brought back memories of Vegas 2. I have only played a couple matches in multiplayer but those I played with were great and the experience was great. I can't wait to find time for some more multiplayer!!! (I think I need to hone my skills a little more first though)  I would not hesitate recommending this game ro anyone that loves FPS action.

The community is amazing, people actually work together and communicate. At the end of a game there is a true sense of comradery with your fellow team members. You all went through that together whether you won or not.   The gameplay mechanics are also top notch, you will always be learning new ways to use the destructible environment to your advantage and likewise having it used against you. A lot of thought has gone into the operator system, there are no glaring imbalances and it makes for some interesting plays. For example reading these reviews you will see Fuze killing hostages a lot. A lot of the time if you pick Fuze on a hostage map people will wonder what you are up to, yet if you place it safely away from the hostage the other team will never see it coming. This is just one example of the constantly adapting strategies throughout this game. It’s a game where thinking is equally as important as quick reflexes. And the first time you manage to outsmart the entire team and get that ACE… my goodness, you will never forget it.   Now I personally have had no issues with the servers or cheaters, I know people do though. However Ubisoft are very active in developing this game, and have a constant presence on reddit and their forums letting people know the status on various bugs they are working on. They do seem determined to make this a success. As they should be, it is an amazing game and it’s a shame it started out so bumpy. I am every bit confident that they will sort out the issues some people are facing in due time. Keep in mind though that it’s generally the people that are having issues that we hear the stories about, not the majority that are having a great time.   I'd fully recommend the game, especially on a steam sale, you have nothing to lose.  10/10  UPDATE 25th Nov 2016  Since writing my previous review there have been a large number of changes to the game. Most noticiable is the introduction of battleye anticheat which has all but removed cheaters from the game. It took its time for the suspicions of players to die down but now that crazy death out of no where is more amazing than tilting. The recent DLCs have shaken up the meta in great new ways, people have to adjust their stratagies and play styles to compensate, always a good thing.   People complain the game is now more fast paced, no more camping in rooms waiting for the attackers to arrive. This is however not so much a symptom of the new DLC characters but more the playerbase has matured and the meta has naturally changed. If all the DLC characters were removed, people wouldn't all suddenly return to camping one room, its just not a good stratagy.   This is a great game, and only gets beter with every new update and every new player.",

Unlike the other Rainbow games, which are all about using tactics and communication to coordinate your attacks, this game allows you to do that for the defending side as well and also adds another factor into the max: destruction. Whether it be causing or preventing it, each operator has gadgets that help them cause it. Whether it be as simple as a Primacord charge or a flashbang to a wall penetrating grenade launcher or a drone able to take out gadgets with a taser, all operators have them. Also being able to shoot through walls. The gunplay requires you to think smart, too. Most guns can kill in three hits, and the ones that can't are either shock drones or have a terrifying rate of fire. But what matters the most is this:  all headshots kill.  No DBNO state, no heavy damage, death. This requires players to think instead of just running and gunning. Contrary to series' like Call of Duty, where shooting someone with a Magnum round in point blank range just leaves them with a bloody monitor.

There are so many options and things you can do on this game that makes it so much different than any other shooter, which is probably why I like it. For me, I'm not generally into these kinds of games, but if you want a first person strategy game that actually requires you work together to succeed, this game is for you. It's not a silly run-n-gun like COD. Which brings me to another good point: This community is actually pretty awesome. Most of the players are 18+ and relatively mature for what it is. Hardly ever will you ever encounter an annoying 14 year old on a mic being obnoxious. That's happened to me twice in the 100+ hours of gameplay that I have, and each time they've been kicked. Nobody wants to deal with that, so they don't.   Cons:  &gt;The ONLY complaint I have about this game is how poorly the servers are ran. If you're not constantly DC'ing during or before the match starts, you have to worry after every single game whether or not it's going to 'Synchronize your data' right before you get your XP and 'Reknown' (currency). If that happens, you just wasted 10-20 minutes on that match. I wouldn't complain if this was an uncommon ocurrence, but it's not. I've had it happen four matches in a row. After the 100+ hours of gameplay, I've only reached level 29/(I don't believe there is a max level). I guarantee I'd be 35+ if it didn't constantly 'synchronize my data.'    I guess I'm going to say that I recommend this game, seeing as the only cons are something on Ubisoft's end and not the actual gameplay. If you don't have patience, I probably wouldn't, seeing as you're probably going to want to chuck your PC out of a window after DC'ing five games in a row. The game is great in itself, but like I said, be weary of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ servers. Uber Soft needs to step it up.",

Hiding your drone in any crevice you can find is an extremely fun mini game at the beginning of each Assault round. The destruction makes the game so much more real and brings an extreme challenge to the players who are coming from basic fps games like CoD or CS:GO. I would recommend this game to any FPS player who wants a game that has a competitive and well rounded system to support a TEAM BASED tactical victory, the game doesn't end when you die, you are still valuable because you can control cameras or the cameras on drones to relay to your team exactly where they are hiding or coming from. This game brings Splinter Cell type stealth that makes you think about every aspect of what you are doing and what is happening around you. Siege has the POTENTIAL to attract a ginormous audience and become a real competitive game with tournaments and fans all around the world. This could be the CS:GO killer.",

Breaking down the gam into Pros and Cons Pros: 2 defenders 2 attackers for each nation Each operator feels unique however only some feel truely needed to succeed A multitude of maps each with a unique level design Defined roles such as Shield, Support, Trapper, ETC Free DLC for the first year  Cons:  The hitboxes sometimes feel like you are being cheated Unfair playstyles and glitches plague the game however the developers are working to fix these Hackers however every game has this problem, ubisoft refuses to use VAC anjd use fairfight (I could be wrong about what program they use) Connection issues are a big problem but have improved from launch.

I am sure there is more xp lost to this problem then there is that has ever bin recived by players. ranked battles is fun have to wiat till lvl 20 wich is fair you hsould have almost all the ops unlocked by then. ranked is also broekn do to server problems puting you in to a fight that only has 3 members agains a full team of 5. game play is fun the mechanics are verry difrent and new and fun to paly with the destructiv walls and enviroment is neat meaning for new ways to play every time. limited to op weponry is a bit of a fall. over all this game is defently worth the full pirce let alone the winter price. I would maybe pay 20 bucks for such a flawed game. Hope this helps others.",

The games optimization for me (everyone can be different) but for me is great. Specs: CPU: AMD A8-5500 GPU: GTX 650 Ti Boost RAM: 8GB DDR3   I am running medium settings getting a constant 60fps.  The game had trouble during the open beta with disconnects and server issues. Since the open beta I haven't had a single problem finding, joining, or disconnecting from games. Also please do not compare this to CSGO its only the same because its a 5v5 bomb scenario game. Thats it other then that they are completely different.  If you read the forums you will hear players say MICROTRANSACTIONS AND NO DEDICATED SERVERS. Both of these statements are completely false. The game for casual and terrorist hunt mode runs P2P connections. The game for ranked matches runs dedicated servers.  As for microtransaction they have them but it doesn't allow you to gain an advantage over other player or you only unlock something such as a weapon if you purchase. The microtransactions are for skins or renown boost (the currency you use to purchase operators in the game).   This game is a must buy for another that loves playing tactical shooters. ",

The maps are great but a few of them have bad objective locations. If you don't mind a little UPLAY, it's a painless experience. MICROPHONES are required, teamwork is paramount to an easy victory. Teams with mics win against teams without. Even if you don't want to talk to your teammates, just telling them where enemies are coming from can go a long way. The gameplay depends on communication and without it, you're destined to fail. Get some friends together and squad up! I also have to bring up that aside from a few teamkillers (I've only seen 2) the community is 1000% better than the toxic dump that is CSGO's players.

The game then resolves in an explosive and chaotic clash of weapons fire based on incomplete information and some players generally being very clever.  This is a thinking man's shooter. Running and gunning won't work because you give away your position and players who are playing smart will simply shoot you in the back. Though it does come down to reactions the outcome of the game is heavily dependent on planning, situational awareness and good understanding of the game mechanics (and the game mechanics have a great breadth leaving many options). Come with patience or go and play CoD.  My only criticisms are that there is no server browser with ping display and it requires uplay. Uplay is annoying when you've bought the game through steam.",

Team in close proximity again and get mowed down by shields  7th Last Round pretty even match its a 3v2 with the last 2 on hostage. Teammate and I are in a fire fight with the last 2 while the other teammate is on the other side of the plane for no reason. Enemy moves into my line of site and i take the shot.

I highly recommend this game to people who like FPS's but not the COD run and gun style of game play. It is as much about strategy as it is actually shooting at other players. Best shooter of the year hands down.   The current issues that are soon to be fixed by the developers are some serious refresh/tick rates that dont work quite properly and the enemy sees you at different locations than what you were actually at. This is the biggest issue that i think will be fixed soon. Matchmaking is mostly better and seems to be working 80-90 percent of the time but still suffers from some minor issues from time to time.",

        {
            "review_text": "Rainbow Six Siege is solid. I love it, so first I will talk about the things that aren't that great about it.  1 - My mic doesn't work even though it works in every other program and game I have used. When I use the push to talk button people can't even see that I am talking. In a game where team play actually matters this is really important and kind of frustrating. I'm not the only one who has this happen.  2 - No matter how much armor you have, one shot to the head will kill you with any weapon. Some of these guys are wearing helmets that should stop at least a single bullet. In a game where having more armor reduces your speed, armor is worthless. Sometimes someone will pop around a corner and kill you instantly. Which brings me to the next point...  3 - Some of the operators in this game have big, bulky helmets and earmuffs (GSG9 especially) or gas masks (SAS). These all count as part of the head. So if someone shoots you in the earmuff, or your big old helmet, or the filter on your gas mask, it will kill you. Instantly. Some characters carry riotshields, which themselves are bulletproof, but usually the tiniest bit of your helmet sticks over the top. If someone shoots that little itty bit of helmet...  4 - The attackers get Grenades like Flashbangs, normal Grenades, and Smoke. The defender, on the other hand, get Nitro. Nitro has a large explosive radius and you can usually detonate it while it is still in the air, unless you threw it on something within the blast radius. Since you can activate it so quickly you can throw it around corners and kill anyone there before they can even react, even someone behind a riotshield. So instead of placing it in hidden spots and waiting for someone to get in the killzone, it is instead a more powerful grenade.  5 - The game really wants to hold your hand. The little drones that search for players have glowing red lights on them, C4 beeps and has a glowing red light on it. One character has a trap that has not only a drill that appear on the other side of the door/window he places it on but has a GLOWING RED LASER on it, which basically makes the character's special ability useless. The objectives, if they are a 'bomb', make beeping noises which help the attackers find them, there is a Call of Duty style grenade indicator which shows you not only if you are close enough to take damage but also if you are close enough get downed by it...  6 - The damage shown on the guns is not the damage actually done. A shot to the head is an instant kill and shots to the legs/arms do reduced damage, but a shot to the chest does not do the damage stated. What is the point of numbers that represent damage if that is not the damage we actually do?  7 - The hitboxes are really simplified. Shooting someones feet is an easy way to kill them if they are stuck in an animation like placing a detonator on a doorframe covered in a barrier (which they themselves can not see through, there is a little gap under the door which can only be seen if you are looking at it from a distance). So basically my complaint is feet do the same damage as the thigh, stomach does same damage as the chest.  And then there are things that will be patched out, like how defenders can glitch through walls during the pregame phase and kill the attackers as soon as they spawn. I've only had this happen once so it is not really a problem. I killed the person that did this (he was on my team) and got kicked by my team (they were probably in a four person squad) but when I rejoined I could not be kicked again (They then accused me of hacking, ironically). I had an AFK guy on my team once and despite having four votes (the teams have five people each) we couldn't kick him. Fun.  Now that we are finally done with all the bad things, why do people love it?  The community is overall great. In my 71 hours of playing I have only encounter one group of people exploiting (the above example) and most people use their mics. If you are the last person on your team and fail miserably people usually are cool about it, and if someone gets angry everyone else will back you up. Usually jerks travel in groups, so you won't see them much playing solo.  There were a lot of bugs with hit registration, and Ubisoft just released an update doubling the tick rate from 30 to 60. !ALL DLC WILL BE FREE! (and I do not suggest you buy the season pass, you do not need to), you will be able to buy operators added post launch with in game credits.  The game has this 'One more round' appeal. Every game you play just makes you want to play a little more, and a little more... and so on.  The game is tactical. If you just run around looking for people without a plan someone will drop you like nobodies business. If you like Search and Destroy in Call of Duty, you would love this game. A lot of people that like CounterStrike also like this game.  If you die you are not just a spectator, you go into support mode. In support mode you can view cameras and spot enemies (which identifies them, showing exactly who they are playing as, and shows your allies their exact location with a visual indication). There is no minimap, you can see exactly where your teamates are through walls. You have the feeling like you are really a team. Working together matters. If you all go through the same door you will get destroyed.  Each operator is unique, to an extent. Twitch gets a drone that can go around and zap people with a low damage taser, Thermite can breach through reinforced walls, Mute can put down jammers that make enemy remote detonators not work in a small radius (like Thermite's Thermite), Thatcher has EMP grenades which counter electronics (like Mute's jammers), Montagne has a riotshield that can cover his entire body while standing up (which allows others to use him as moble cover), Blitz has a riotshield with the capabilities of a flashbang, Smoke has a throwable gas grenade that can cutoff chokepoints for a short time (and a shield will not protect you from a gas grenade), Glaz has a sniper rifle capable of shooting through the windows on the airplane map or through deployable barriers enemies place, Pulse can see enemies behind walls, Rook can give his whole team an armor buff, Doc can revive players with a dart gun instantly and from a distance at increased health, Castle can place down bulletproof barriers that can't be shot through, and using mute with Castle's barriers means that you either have to slowly beat them down, or use Sledge who can break down walls in one hit with his sledge hammer, or use Ash who has a grenade launcher than destroys walls from a distance.  That was a lot of text, and it is not even all the operators, although some of them are just not that useful (like Tachanka, who can place a heavy machinegun which... can't shoot through riot shields, and leave the operator totally defenseless, and does not even have a 360 degree turn radius...) but the point is you can play as a character that completely changes the game. Some characters work together better than others (like the mute/castle example above) and some character play off characters on the other team (like Mute/Thermite counter or Thatcher/mute counter). Fuze can place a device that launches five grenades into a room, but Jager can place down 'ADS' that kill grenades before they explode.  The idea is the game is really deep. It matters more than just what gun you have or how fast you react to situations, but who you play and how you play them. It is very rare to have two games be the same because of how many variables there are. The ability not just shoot through walls but destroy them, placing barricades in windows and doorframes, reinforcing walls (which only Thermite can break through), placing barb wire to slow enemies, placing deployable walls, I've hit the word limit, but I have only begun to describe how great this game is, and it should only get better.",

Due to the nature of the updates, the balance of the game is constantly monitored and adjusted, and the result is fun for all.   Also of note is the addition of Battleye, which has been activated and is dropping the banhammer on cheaters. Ubisoft says some 3800 players have been banned and the process will be accelerating in the future. The game has improved massively since the activation of Battleye.

The developers did a great job. The publisher however requires you to download this buggy crappy poorly made software called Uplay. This game is great. Uplay is like steam, only made entirely out of ♥♥♥♥ by a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  Uplay crashes. uplay servers are often unavailble, the game tries to cloud sync to uplay and gets stuck in a loop forcing you to lose any points you have earned. When joining a match the game will simply freeze as the uplay servers failed to work correctly and are stuck in an infinate loading loop, forcing you to alt-f4 in order to get out of it. To top it all off these are just the bugs and errors I have had in the past 4 hours. There are many many many more, all caused by Uplay.  If this game didn't have Uplay I would rate it 10/10. Even with Uplay I still think it is worth buying because when it does work the game is truely what rainbow six games where back in the day before good old Tom sold his soul.  Sadly because this game has Uplay, I rate it only, 5/10.",

Meaning that if the player who is hosting the lobby leaves, it boots you back to the main menu, regardless of where you are in the timeline of a match. Whether searching for more players prior to the match start or lining up a headshot on the final terrorist, if the host leaves, the game is over. Call of Duty has had host migration since... forever?

(Basicly what it is, is that audio clips abort mid clip or just don't play at all. Gotten me quite a few bs deaths but it's manageble, especially if you have a good team that is watching your back) Comunity is nice with just a few rotten eggs that can't take a misstake and trolls you. I have seen a rise in cheat activity or at least fishy behaviour however it seems to be just in the higher ranks, could be that my plat ♥♥♥ is just plain bad too but w/e ;)  The game play is great! Super tacticool and a lot of nice people to play with if you and your allies feel like opening up to eachother. Playing premade is definetly recomended since this game takes a lot of teamwork to play well. Ofcourse like in other shooters you can solo carry if you are good enough, if you can though you will most likly go up in rank quickly and it will soon be required to use teamwork again.  Can't compare this game to CS more than that it's a shooter and round based and seing people comparing it is just stupid. Sure, everyone will have their favorite but these games can't be compared that easily. If I would try and do it simply though I'd say that this game is more about what you can do WITH the map while CS is more about what you can do AROUND the map.  So how well does the game run on my pc? Well, I have a i5, 970 and 16gb memory and I'm able to run this game with the highest settings (not 4k textures) with a solid 86fps (70-120). I've noticed that people complain in the discussion section that they have good setups and have fps problems and from what I've been able to see most of those commenting have a graphics card from the nvidia 700 series so maybe a problem with those drivers?

If you expect this to be like the old Raven Shield with 15 human players versus Ai, You've come to the wrong place, its only reserved for 5v5, perhaps there will be dedicated servers, but it seems with the 3rd party ubisoft activation process, it doesn't seem likely we're gona see dedicated servers like in Raven Shield.  You'd probably enjoy this game if you played the old Raven Shield, although there are no more doors you can slide or peek into. There are instances where you can view with devices and also it offers different class operators who are specialized in whatever trait each soldier can do. Very tactical, 'almost' all walls and windows can be broken. There is the ability of vaulting desks and small obstacles, also you can rapel and swing left or right direction and turn your body upside down so you can shoot into the windows from the outside without exposing your whole body, well your head is exposed.

I don't feel crippled when we take a certain kind, and a good team can easily beat out its bad composition. Balance patches have been well-done and well-implemented.  My biggest complaints are the latency, cheating, and the lighting. Even with my pretty damned good connection, I typically can't find a game with ping under 100ms. This really makes 'peaker's advantage' the meta, which limits a lot of potentially useful tactics. Cheating is rampant in Ranked mode, but rare in Casual, and it's supposedly even a huge problem in the game's competitive scene. Using the recommended brightness settings puts you at a massive disadvantage as it makes any enemy in a shadow practically invisible, and turning up the brightness to see makes everything blinding and ugly.  Overall, these don't detract too much from the experience. The game is actively fun to play, especially with a coordinated team.",

If you like games like CS GO where you are on a 5v5 and can't respawn till your team or the enemy wins the round. This is the same as that but with teamwork and communication plus with better graphics and Feature's. Now my judgement on the game is Yes i would reccomend. The reason why i say this is because the game lets you simulate what swat teams use to save hostages and you have to think carfully because you actions effect your team.

I love this game for many reasons. First: The community, everyone here is amazing whether they be level 1 or 100 you will alomost always have a good encounter with them. Second: The gunplay in this game is amazing. The animations, the recoil, the muzzle flash is all on par with the realistic sense of combat in this game. Third: The sense of achievement you get whenever you do well. Haveing over 500 hours in this game I have had some amazing moments ( and some pretty shity ones as well). Like when its you versus 5 people and you still manage to win the round. that is pretty much the best feeling on the planet to do that. Fourth: The strongly oriented team combat mechanic. Without team communication and teamwork I would have quit this game a long time ago. When you're almost dead and enemys are swarming you, and your teamates break through a wall and save you, that is the most amazing feeling ever. And lastly the operators. Every round you play you will be asked to play as an operator you have unlocked. Whether it be S.A.S, GIGN, Spetsnaz, F.B.I, GSG9, JFT2, and Navy Seals the deaply rooted biography and phycological reports, that are there for every operator in the personal tab, leave you with a sense of humanity for these people you can play as. It makes you not want to Rambo the game, it makes you want to stay alive the whole match. So when you eventually find combat, you stop and think if you really want to engadge with this operator you've come to know with and possibly die not having a second life really makes you think. Alright thats enough rambling for now. you have now finnished me surely misspelled review of Rainbow Six Siege! Thanks for reding and have a good one.",

Do you like games which are realistic but not overly so that it makes it unenjoyable? Do you like unique characters that have their own style of play and personality? Then Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is for you.   Every match is a five versus five with three to four rounds (four to five if in ranked). You can pick from up to eleven defenders and eleven attackers. Every round starts off with preperation. Defenders reinforce their location and attackers scout the map with drones.   Gameplay is fluid and intense. It's intense because in this game, any shot to the head can kill you, so being aware of your surroundings is key. The gunplay in this game is magical but the hit registration still needs work (Still very accurate but needs tweaks). In this game, you can destroy any wall, which allows you to be creative with the way you reach your objective.   The graphics are nice. They're pleasant to look at and matches the style of the game. They paid a lot of attention to destructable objects like walls and props because when they are destroyed, it's very realistic. Some textures need a little work but I haven't paid graphics much mind in this game.   All in all. I believe that this game is amazing and will provide me with a lot more hours of fun.

Now, the first months of this game was rough, that is when most of the negative reviews came, mostly because of netcode issues and for a game that is headshot-based this was a big problem. But Ubisoft was always ready to fix any problem reported by the community. There was some hackers in-game, specially in the ranked matches, but after the addition of BattlEye they (the hackers) got all removed and banned. The gameplay is solid and heavily team oriented, but you DO NOT need to play it with friends to have a great time. The community is highly friendly (of course there are some exceptions) and offers great help for newcomers, and some will even end-up being friends with you after some matches. In summary, this is a great game for FPS fans and if you want to buy this game go for it and you won't be disappointed.",

No LoS to the non-shield guy. As shield closes in on hostage, I shotgun blast him in the back. I listen. Guy runs away back into the other room. I reload and reposition. 15 seconds left Guy runs in and turns and starts shooting at the pile of bodies. I stand up from prone and shotgun blast him in the chest. 10/10 best match ever  Pros:  1.) In depth mechanics and breakable objects. 2.) Fast paced and high intensity gameplay. 3.) Fairly balanced weapons and equipment.  Cons: 1.) Servers can be annoying at times (Laggy, unable to connect, etc.) 2.) Shields can be some-what OP. 3.) Headshots...Headshots everywhere. Both good and bad but sometimes the RNG is way too strong  If you like COD search and destroy with the battlefield destructibility, this game is for you.  YOU BUY NOW!",

I have to hand it to Ubisoft for updating the game and tackling issues with the game decisively. Due to the nature of the updates, the balance of the game is constantly monitored and adjusted, and the result is fun for all.   Also of note is the addition of Battleye, which has been activated and is dropping the banhammer on cheaters. Ubisoft says some 3800 players have been banned and the process will be accelerating in the future. The game has improved massively since the activation of Battleye. The recent Skull Rain update has made this game over 1 million players strong. If this trend is anything to go by, I think the game will be getting better come next season.",

It's a very well made shooter, although, there are many server issues that are present. Most have been fixed since launch, but time to time, there are some problems with the servers that pop out of nowhere. I also have come across a problem with my nat type. It keeps giving me a moderate nat type, which doesn't allow me to play with my friends, whilst on the other hand, for other games, I always have an open nat type. I have come across many people that have had the same problem on the internet, so I'm not 100% sure if it's a problem on my behalf, or on Ubisoft's behalf (probably Ubisoft since they are just TOO good with servers and connection etc).

You can't fight against half the stuff in this game because of internet. Their sniper(Glaz) should 12 feet behind, but it becomes a headshot. 2.) Mechanics are iffy aF. When you look at somebody, they are looking a totally different place. Yet, on their screen, they were looking at you the whole time. Another example is when the nitro cell is on the other side of the wall, an unbreakable one, and it kills you, but when you throw one at a shield or anyone, it doesn't do any damage at ALL! 'Spray patterns' are messed up as well. A gun will shoot and most of the time, you hit them. Aim or not aiming, you will have a 95% chance of getting the kill. Someone can shoot you across the map with a pistol hip-firing and get a 'lucky' headshot. 3.)Community will either have ♥♥♥♥ or kewl ppl. I've been lucky to be with kewl ppl. Most of the time.  There are many good things like 'teamwork' partialy. If not, with friends, you can mess around with the operators. Either way, that's all I can think of. I guess I can recommend it, but watch out for those cons.

            "review_text": "TLDR: Game as of february 2016 has a lot of server problems but when the game works it's very fun, and once the servers get fixed the game will be very good.  I've played this game for quite a bit and this game can be very enjoyable at times, but it can also be very frustrating. Game has a lot of issues, but most of them are fixable and some patches they are fixed but then they mess it all up with a new patch somehow.  So the biggest problems are all related to servers. A lot of the times you're just playing and then BOOM you get an error and you're disconnected from the servers. Another problem is hit detection and it's most notable when you're playing with the sniper. Your scope might be on your opponents head when you shoot but you wont hit him, at first you might think that you missed the shot but when this happens one too many times, it gets quite clear what the problem is and because of that the game is very inconsistent.  That being said when everything works it's very fun, if you like tactical shooters of course. Theres a lot of different classes and each of them have some kind of a speciality that makes them unique and because of that the game can be played very differently on each round, it's very dependent on the objective type, and where it's located at, also the fact that a lot of the walls are breakable adds to. In conclusion I would definitely reccomend the game if you don't mind the server problems, but when you do then just wait until they figure out how to fix them permanently and by then the game probably cheaper as well but there might be less people playing, but that depends on multiple things, for example, if the servers are going to be messed up too long a lot of people are going to get sick of it and just quit and when theres not eough people to find a game fast enough then those people will quit as well and the game will just die out.",

Siege's base gameplay is strategic mixed with the twitch shooters that we all know and love. Siege rewards player for playing strategically with operator's unique abilities. Different operators change the way that your attack plan or defense plan will be played out. None of the operators in the game feel incredibly unfair and they all interact with the game in a fun and compelling way. In addition to Siege's Unique multiplayer mode, it comes with a PVE mode called terrorist hunt. Terrorist hunt is a fun way for new players to learn maps and get familiar with Siege's satisfying gunplay. But of course the main dish of Siege is the multiplayer, which can provide many hours of compelling gameplay. Siege is well worth the money, especially if you already like games like CSGO, COD, or BF. And The operator's unique abilities will be a comfortable way to ease into the twitch shooter side of Rainbow Six Siege if you're already familiar with a game like Overwatch or Team Fortress 2.",

As a result of this there have been a couple of huge waves of seemingly endless amounts of people being banned, we know this because Battleye sends everyone an on-screen notification when it swings the banhammer at someone; probably to restore all long lost trust in this game's community by showing cheaters being mown down. I feel it is safe to play ranked once more, although there will most likely be the occasional hacker that battleye cannot catch yet, but they will be caught soon!   The idea of the game is awesome, and now the execution of said idea is catching up! It is by far my favourite game, which is why ive almost lost 1000hrs of my life to it, and if they keep improving and polishing it i will lose countless more!   The only real problem left i have with this game is ,of course, the netcode. It has been improving, but still so many times i have hit a headshot, the targets head snapped back with blood flying all over the shop and it hasn't registered as a kill is appalling, the game has 1 shot headshots for any gun at any range, except now the Luison (you'll understand why when you play caveira) yet they never seem to register, and the main problem with this for me is the game has a fast time to die, about maybe 4-5 bullets with most weapons so you want to go for headshots and kill instantly instead of taking return fire, and it is so infuriating to die to return fire from someone who's head is splattered on the back wall!   But hey-ho hopefully the next season will bring a big netcode update!  So all in all... i would 1000% recommend you buying this game! Now is absolutely the best time to buy as the game seems to be growing, with around 1.6 million people playing it now compared to a smaller number at release!!! and with the ?£15 starter edition? i believe it is called whats really holding you back now?",

I only played a couple of the tutorials because I found them boring but they get you your initial points that allow you to unlock characters. If you don't unlock a character before diving into multiplayer you'll be stuck playing as a recruit. The tutorials give a ton of points so I'd say get 1000 points and unlock an attacker and defender, then head into the matches (unless you enjoy the tutorials, there are 8 I believe).  First 5 games, I played with a friend. He was trying to lay prone and kept break dancing on the floor then got shot in the face. Then the next match, we were trying to figure out how to Rapel down a wall and fell to our deaths. We were laughing at how awful we were at the game but after those first 5 matches (which go by really quickly) we started getting the hang of things, learning the maps and combat, getting used to our unlocked characters abilities and how best use them. Needless to say, I sat here for hours playing after being on the fence because I didn't have a full group to play it with.  I don't usually review games on here but this game feels new. Such a breath of fresh air. Combat, tactics, close quarters... This game is seriously a winner on many levels. I've joined groups solo or with one or two other friends. I've never had a full group and I want to be clear that you don't have to have a bunch of friends playing to enjoy this game. Yes you can play ranked and if you do it would probably be a good idea to find some serious people to play with but I played on casual for hours without feeling like I was missing out on anything.   Get a mic, make sure you get your push to talk working properly, and dive in. If you enjoy counter-strike (or used to enjoy counter-strike) you will enjoy this game. It has those great CS moments of 1v1 where you're trying to break the tie and everything is riding on you or the other guy to win it all. (games I played were often tied at 2/2 and ended with a tie breaker round. The map rotates and changes who you play against when someone wins 3 I believe).  Don't let those 7-8 reviews scare you away from this one. It is worth diving into. Aboslutely, 100% worth it.",

There is no single player campaign apart from an advanced tutorial which they call Situations, a nice way to learn the controls and abilities but not a campaign by any means. I found the graphics to be good but not great whilst the audio was very good, from the weapons sounds to the noise when an enemy approaches it has been done very well. Unfortunately for me there is just not enough to do and very little variety in the missions - mainly protect hostage or extract. I have played Multi Player several times but not being in the US I get lag so after being killed without even seeing how or what happened numerous times my patience wore too thin and returned to CoOp which still has some lag but its playable. To sum up they should have developed the CoOp much more and had a single player campaign in there to boot which would have made this game purchase worth the high price. As it stands this game is over priced for what you get and unless you are playing on a closed LAN or private CoOp matches you WILL get lag. Decent game but could have been so so much better if they didn't aim to make a game for kids in the US who luv to play MultiPlayer, outside of there you are playing in Laggsville.  ",

Every game has the potential to be truly different and thus it can really hold your attention, and on top of that, it is far more exciting and immersive than any multiplayer FPS you've played before. I'm going to recommend this, I just want to point out why people are seeing a mostly positive and not an overwhelmingly positive average so that hopefully they can make a more informed decision. I held off on this game for a long time because the reviews weren't totally glowing, and I regret that. The truth is it does have some problems. I'm seeing now how difficult it must be to test this game for bugs, and it has taken a long time for them to work away at it. Some of it is gone now, but beware, it's not all gone. On top of this, I have never come across a game which spends more time loading than this. I understand mostly why it must be that way, but it really cuts away from the fun you could be having. The matchmaking is pretty slow on top of that, so you're really just going to do a lot of waiting for not much playing. My final complaint is that the player base can be extremely toxic. I've never seen so many people just straight up throwing insults around and being rude when there's no need at all. People use chat more to be toxic than they do to communicate about the game, and suprisingly few people use voice chat when it's pretty essential to the game. I recommend this - just please come with a good attitude towards teamwork, a mic, and be prepared to wait around.",

I have had tons of fun with it and definately recieved my money's worth. Why the negative review you may ask? The game lacks any in engine anti-cheat. Fairfight is a data collection tool that catches players based on statistics. It does almost nothing to deter people from hacking, sure it might eventually catch them, but that is too little too late. I cannot reccomend this game in its current state. Within the past two months my team went from about 1 in 5 suspicious games to 2 in every 3. It is almost impossible to enjoy the game when you hit the platinum/diamond rank. Ubisoft claims they are 'Discussing the cheating issue daily in meetings', but this means absolutely nothing to us (the game is 5 months old now...). I will update this review if Ubisoft makes a valid attempt to stop the cheating, but for now I cannot reccomend this game.  5/14/16: Patch 3.0 is out and some of the new QoL improvements look great. I would like to clarify that changing the code of conduct to ban people quicker will accomplish abosulutely nothing if the anti-cheat is not picking them up to begin with. I have heard more people have been banned since the launch of 3.0, but Fairfight can only do so much and take time to detect each new hack. We still need a first line of defense.  8/1/16: I cannot believe I am saying this, but Ubisoft has added Battleye anti-cheat. After playing many matches with it and seeing first hand people getting banned I am extremely satisfied. Patch 4.0 launches tomorrow and with it many great QoL changes. This recent refocus on the health of the game has sold me on the fact that they really want seige to succeed.",

People are jerks, especially people you don't know. A game like this is better when you are grouped with your friends. That way you aren't too worried about sucking or not, and can enjoy the game. You also have the added bonus of knowing each others playstyle, and having a fairly good idea how the other people are going to play, and that gives you an added bonus.  However the game does have 'Situations' and lone wolf mode, for those times when you just don't want to deal with people you have never met, and while it lacks a good storyline, it's still enjoyable and for that I am going to thumbs up it.",

This is probably the best tactical shooter in the mainstream (console) market and I am glad to see something generally available like this. For the most part people play as a team although most matches could use more mic communication as they can be they key to winning matches. The guns feel well balanced (keep in mind most take only several rounds to kill someone) and the different characters feel extremely balanced. Many Characters balance characters on the opposite team which is great to see. For instance Jager can be a great defense with Fuse. Characters on the same team can also give added benefits like Mute with Castle making every combination different.  For those who complain about content they are correct in that there isn't many launching maps, with that said the maps are extremely large and take place in different areas and different times (night/day). There is tons of replay-ability here, more then any of these awful 'ground breaking shooters' out there (evolve titanfall). For those like myself that held out to see if the bugs would be fix and the community stayed strong, it is fairly safe to say this game is still strong and I suspect it will be around for a while as long as they keep supporting it.",

            "review_text": " Plese read it all, it's worth your time as it explains everything thoroughly.    Real life siege scenario:  -Snipers surrounding the building/area so that if any defender would go outside they would get their brains splattered all over the pavement. -Tons of swat and cops surrounding the building (that in this case could be used by  heavilly  suppressing without actually hitting ( and causing damage to ) any defenders who would stand in front of a broken barricade on a window aiming to spawnkill the attackers. This heavy suppression could act like Battlefield's suppression mechanic and force that defender away from the window and saving the attackers from tons of frustration).   R6S siege scenario:  -Defenders can run outside and do whatever the flying f@ck they want with the only penalty being that they are visible for the attackers at all times while outside ( they don't even become visible right away, 2 seconds must pass after they've gone outside for them to be detected ). -Defenders can peek the windows mentioned above and spawnkill everyone without any risk. -4 out of 5 defenders roam for 99% of the matches thus making the attacker role very unpleasant since the game becomes 'CoD: Inside a building Warfare' instead of the defenders reinforcing everything and the attackers having to strategically create new vulnerabilities or exploit already present vulnerabilities in order to accomplish their mission.   About the game mechanics:  -No scope sway. It feels like a robot is holding the gun. When moving it feels like a wall is constantly under your gun on which you have deployed a bipod since the gun is extremely steady while moving. -You are able to shoot while mid-air and apart from the fact that it doesn't make any sense it also allows a defender to jump off a window and kill the attackers before even touching the ground. -Recoil is pretty present but once you put a foregrip and a compensator it becomes almost non-existent. This shouldn't be the case. -Bullets don't actually come out of the gun's barrell but instead they come out of the rifleman's eye ( center of the scope ) thus making it feel weird, wrong and allowing headglitching which is a massive problem especially when an attacker is peeking a window while rappeling. Instead of seeing his upper torso and his head, you see only the part of his head where the eyes are. -Drones which are very important and can save an attackers life have big, glowing red lights on them that are visible from a mile away. -When hip-firing bullets do 30-45-60 degree turns once they leave the barrell while shotguns' pellet spread is 'magically' reduced when you aim down sights. I know what you might say, that hip fire is supposed to work like that but guns and physics are not! -You are able to aim down sights and shoot while moving prone which ism't physically possible.   Support from the devs:  Ever since day 1 they have been releasing countless patches and hotfixes that address numerous bugs, glitches and issues in general. Every 2-3 months they release new 'Seasons' which means that they release 2 new operators and 1 new map for free! At the start of Season 3 they even implemented a new client-side Anti-Cheat software which is extremely hard to do after the game has been released. They also listen to the community's feedback and adapt accordingly.   About the free operators new Seasons bring us:  Personally, the only good operators we got, were Season 1's. All the others have done more damage than good by massivelly unbalancing the game and causing a lot of problems ( at least they're free ) : -Blackbeard: Apart from the fact that a shield mounted on your rifle makes no sense since you would get a broken shoulder and a serious concusion when stopping bullets with it, it also doesn't make the game any better since once he peeks a window or manages to put his body in cover and have his head covered by the shield he is a god. -Valkyrie: She was supposed to throw her cameras in rooms that were extremely important but had no cameras placed in them by default. Instead, people throw these cameras out of the building and spawnkill the attackers or constantly look through them until they find the perfect timing to kill the attackers by going outside the building ( which should not be possible ) -Caveira: They added a dedicated roaming operator while one of this game's major issues is roaming. Also, this Brazilian theme feels weird and out of place ( it's a game about special forces ) especially if you take into account that in Tom Clany's books, 'Rainbow' team consists only by operators from NATO countries. -( Will update when the Japanese operators will be released ).   About the free maps new Seasons bring us:  They aren't that good. I'd say that they are mediocre, especially the newest one called 'Favela'. They're free at least.   Unbalanced aspects:  -If someone knifes your shield, for an unknown reason your character will put the shield away leaving you open to knives and bullets. Why would someone do that? You stop bullets with that shield and you don't even flinch but when someone knifes you you send it into orbit? Wtf?... -While approaching as a shield operator people just shoot the exposed hand holding the pistol without you having an option to withdraw that hand behind your shield. As a result you die from a mile away. -Too many C4s. Instead of leading the assault with your shield while having your teammates stand behind you for cover you get blown to sh!t along with any teammates who might use you for cover. Especially now with the implementation of Impact grenades, operators who previously didn't have any explosives now have impact grenades. -The SMG-11 aka MAC 10 when used with an ACOG makes a better sniper rifle than an actuall sniper rifle ( Glaz' primary ). Also, how the f@ck do you equip an ACOG to a pistol barrell-lenght SMG?    About the potential this game had:  If this game would represent what a real-life siege scenario would look like it would have been the best and very unique on the market. Instead the defenders can do whatever they want and the attackers could be renamed 'Defenders who spawned outside of the building' since in this game there is no actual deference between 'Attackers' and '(Pseudo-)Defenders'. I think it would also have been a lot better if it would be simply a CTU vs terrorist theme ( and being able to choose from a big list of weapons that could be used no matter the side you got spawned in ) instead of this 'everyone has a shiny gadget', CTU vs CTU system.    This game is not worthy to have Tom Clany's name on it as he would never write something so far from reality where the world hasn't discovered snipers and where guns defy the laws of physics. Damn, it's not even worthy to have the word 'Siege' on its title!   HOWEVER! Although it doesn't depict what a real life Siege would look like and the netcode is terrible ( headshots don't even register a lot of times ) I say that this game is 'Recommended' because it's tons of fun to play, especially with friends. It has tons and I mean a sh!t ton of frustrating moments but the gameplay is fun. ",

This isn't a casual game in the least bit, and it has a substantially different learning curve than say CSGO. Some people just don't know how to adjust to siege, and its defintely not a game for everyone; That said it still is an amazing game. While it only has 13 maps the objective locations change around enough to a point where playing the same map on the same game mode over and over again will provide different experinces. On top of that playing against different teams with different stratgies means that tactics are constantly changing as well. Different walls will be reinforced, people might rush or be more reservered, there are just so many combinations that replayibilty is skyhigh. The characters are all unique and fun to play. The gunplay is simple but well done. Movement for the most part is easy.  Compared to counterstrike there is so much more to learn than just the layouts of the maps, but real strategy. And with all guns being a one shot headshot there is a consistancy to firefights and a real need to play carefully as dying is very easy in this game. All in all I can easily see myself putting over 600 hours on this game, and still be doing things I've never done before. Siege is the sandbox game of the competeive FPS genre.",

Gunplay is pretty balanced while the 1 shot headshot mechanic is annoying sometimes its still pretty amazing and every operator plays differently form one another example you can pick an operator which fast he can roam around the map much easier the downside he only has 1 armor another example you can pick an operator with 3 armor the downside is of course he is very slow so it makes you think whether you want to roam around the map or stay near the objective. Gamemodes there is Secure,Bomb,and Hostage while yes for a game that cost around $40 its pretty lame but almost each match and rounds plays differently.  Conclusion Rainbow Six Siege is an awesome tachtical fps i've have ever played the people are nice almost no one calls you a noob for being new,the gunplay i good but not great,team play is amazing,and gamemode while there is only 3 gamemode and 10+ i will guaranty you will have a blast playing this game solo or with friends.

However I would recommend if you are thinking about buying it, to have friends to play with as the game itself, is far more enjoyable when you play with people you know and can easily chat to while playing.  It is a game focused on giving as much information to your team-mates as possible and I find the communication can be lacking when playing with randoms.  Pros + Many different operators with unique abilities to choose from. + R6S is a HIGHLY TACTICAL game. + Wonderful graphics. + DLC doesn't limit anyone, You can play DLC maps for free and unlock DLC operators with in game renown. + Most skins only cost in game currency.  Cons - UPLAY, UBISOFT. We got Steam already. Your existence is pointless!! - Ping is a big ***** issue!!!! - RANKED matches are not balanced. - 5 rounds per game is too short. - Alot of hackers IMO. - No single-player mode.  OVERALL!,  'Excellent game that combines everything a player looking for a HIGH-LEVEL shooting game.'",

            "review_text": "Rainbow Six Siege siege is one of the funnest tactical fps s i have ever played. As it sits right now there are 2 main modes 5v5 pvp and pve terrorist hunt, both have a variety missions within them. PVP matches take pace in rounds where teams take turns attacking and defending. On both modes players choose from different operators(different for attackers/defenders) with unique gadgets such as a shield to block bullets or a sledge hammer to break walls. Different operators have different armor and speed values. Defenders at the start of a round can choose the objective location and set up defences. Attackers at the start of the round sout with drones which can be destroyed trying to find the objectives.   The big selling point of this game is the distructible enviroment where most wall and some floors can destroyed/shot through rewarding creative people who understand the mechanics and know the maps. Map variety isnt huge but the ability to destroy the enviroment and objectives being in different locations ensures every match feels unique. At one point or another your going to be accused of hacking because you shot someone through a wall which is the most rewarding feeling in the game. Visually the game looks great and every map is feels different.    In my opinion this game plays most similar to counter strike where team work and map knowledge are key but with less emphasis on mastering weapon spread paterns. Just like CS there are no respawns, timed objective based rounds, friendly fire, and you can not regain health by waiting(There is one operator whos gadget can heal though). Headshots are a 1 shot kill with any weapon which can be frustrating at times but personally dont want to see it removed because they reward accuracy and increase the risk of peaking in some situations. Just like in csgo a dropped teammate puts your team at a significant disadvantage however its still possible to win with enough coordination and skill.   I would not recomend getting the game at its full price of 69.99 can, i suggest waiting for a sale or a price drop to at least 30-40 dollars. Net code isnt perfect in this game but is always getting improved. It is frustrating when you die at the start of the round not everyone has a mic. For me i find i cant turn up teammate mic up enough. There isnt enough weapon attatchment variety the only thing i really ever change is the type of sight and put a grip and flash hider on every gun that has the option. Suppresors and lazer pointers arent worth it in my opinion. Operators are very slow to be buffed or nerfed and not all are worth it (poor tachanka:( ...). There isnt really any single player content terrorist hunt the pve mode can be played solo but you want to do it coop most of the time. At lower elos it can be frustrating with some teams that want to play search and kill instead of playing the objectives.    To put it shortly RS S is a unique tactical shooter that exceptionaly rewards smart gamelpay rather than run and gun how ever has aspects that may frustrate some people who want a very polished game or lone wolf players. Not worth full release price for most people.",

This game is kept alive with seasonal updates, releasing new content afterr every competitive season. The only problem I have with this game is that you pretty much need the season pass in order to get the newer operators like Buck, Frost, Caviera, Capitao, Blackbeard, Valkyrie, Echo, and Hibana, but its not impossible to get them for free, but it takes alot of grinding.",

            "review_text": "After 200 some hours, I feel it's safe to say that Rainbow Six Siege is the best multiplayer shooter I've ever experienced. Ubisoft seems poised to market this game as a rival to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, and I feel it definitely has that potential.   + Graphics. Game is absolutely gorgeous, especially at Ultra with the high resolution texture pack installed. There's a wealth of options, including support for switching between nonstandard refresh rates, a numbered FOV slider, and more antialiasing combinations than you can count. Shader quality is the heavy hitter setting in Siege, so if you're struggling for performance, don't set it to high. There is also a Temporal Filtering option, which uses a complex patchwork of lower resolution squares that combines data from earlier frames; it sacrifices visual quality to increase the framerate and reduce VRAM usage dramatically. A great option for low-end or laptop gamers, or high-refresh rate players on medium-spec rigs.  + The gameplay is dynamic -- every round is different, and yet it remains tactical and team-oriented. Counter-Strike has become increasingly stale to me the more I play Siege. I always check the same spots, throw the same smokes, and plant the bomb in the same places. I've seen the same round a million times, and the fact that there's up to 30 of them in a game only makes matters worse.  + Pacing. Playing as a defender, you're left to roam quietly near the objective as you can hear the footsteps and gunfire of the attackers slowly close in on you. For a while, nothing happens but information gathering. Then, one of your teammates across the map gets downed. Twenty seconds later, an explosion in that direction, then closer. Half a minute more, and the attackers begin their siege, with explosions and destruction pounding the objective area and gunfire flying past your head. Every round is a slow and intense buildup to a climactic and explosive moment of truth.  + Map variety. There's a upper-middle class house, a biker club, a christmas-themed cafe, a colorful favela, a beached yacht in the arctic, a border facility in the Middle East, a coast guard office, and several others, each meticulously detailed and impressive. Many are based on real-life counterterrorist operations, like a compound in the central US or a cramped commercial flight. And all are fileld with plenty of destructible walls, floors, and ceilings.  + Sound. Holy crap, Ubisoft nailed sound in this one. It might not be quite as aurally impressive as the work DICE is known for, but Ubisoft has some tricks up its sleeves. First off, sound doesn't just travel through walls in all directions like in most games. Instead, it travels based on the shape of the map. If there's an enemy shooting in the room to your left, but the only door into your room is to your front, then you'll hear their sounds coming from your front, but if there's a hole in the wall to your left you'll hear them directly to your left. This isn't nearly as misleading as you might think, the audio wizards at Ubisoft have still managed to make tracking players by sound just as easy as any other game. Because sound travels in a path, following it will always lead you to the enemy. In addition, the ambient sounds are incredible. Light humming of AC units and coolers, grandfather clocks ticking and chiming, distant party music, far-away screams when you first fire your weapon, and training soldiers in the distance on a military base are all there to be heard if you listen closely.  + The destruction is not only gorgeous, it adds so much intrigue and strategy to the maps. Opening new sight lines and pathways isn't a gimmick, it's critical to effective play. While games like Battlefield tout their destructive prowess, its gameplay implications are rather shallow.  + The gunplay is tight, diverse, and satisfying. After 700 hours in CSGO I was getting really tired of AK (and only AK and M4, nothing else is commonly used) taps doing nothing, and even though I had mastered recoil control the whole system felt very outdated and unintuitive. Siege takes the gunplay you'd see in most modern shooters and adapts it to foster skilled play. Headshots are always lethal and your first shot will always hit where you aim, leading to some incredibly satisfying shots.  + Operators give the player a chance to specialize in something meaningful. In CS you have riflers and AWPers. Battlefield does slightly better with its Medic, Engineer, Support, and Recon. But Siege offers a wide cast of operators with some very exciting abilities. Valkyrie can throw cameras wherever she likes, letting her keep tabs on the enemy's advance. Blitz has a flash on his shield, making him extremely deadly in a 1v1 situation. Caveira can interrogate downed enemies to give her entire team the realtime locations of the opposing force.  + Ubi's business model is great. Knowing Ubisoft's past reputation I was very afraid going into Siege. I was expecting new operators and maps to be locked behind a paywall and splintering the community, and skins were all going to be bought with real-world cash. None of this was true, all DLC operators and maps are free (with operators being unlocked with ingame currency, which isn't hard to come by). And more and more skins are becoming purchase-able with ingame currency, to the point where some high ticket items are entirely free as far as real-world funds are concerned.  However, every rose has its thorns.  - Balance. I have to commend Ubisoft for managing to keep such a diverse game as balanced as it is, but there's still some pretty glaring faults. Semiautomatic shotguns are overpowered (although this is being addressed by a patch soon), where pump actions are pea shooters. Some operators (Tachanka, Glaz) are hardly useful, while others are must-picks (Thermite, Rook, Valkyrie).  - Lighting. Looking outside a window is like staring into the bowels of the sun itself in the daytime, while you really have to squint to make out lots of things while peeking into a building. While this feature is intended to prevent defenders from picking off attackers before they even get close and to encourage attackers to enter the building, it's still very overdone. For this reason, night maps are much more enjoyable to play because of their more even lighting.  - Networking. Pings are mediocre at best, but the real problem is the semi-frequent disconnects. I don't get them often, but at least once every three games somebody on either team gets dropped from the game. I'm also matched with South American players on US servers on a surprisingly regular basis, and their absurdly high pings make them hard to fight. Peeker's advantage is king, the delay between when you peek on your screen and when your enemy sees you peek is so large that it is always better to be peeking than it is to be holding an angle.   - Voice comms. Ingame voice chat is pretty shaky. Some players are way too quiet when they're otherwise at a good volume in other games. Voice comms also frequently cut out between different screen, or lag out sometimes. It's not too terrible, but it definitely needs improvement.  - Terrorist Hunt. It could be absolutely incredible, but instead it's just something I play for the ingame currency boost. The AI is inconsistent as all hell; for the most part they're stupid and worse at the game than a small child, but the moment you blow a hole in the wall they turn into deadeye marksmen with the spatial awareness of a god. They also spawn outside with no warning, so if you're the type of player who likes to pick off players from an adjacent building, you're sh*t outta luck.  All in all, Siege is well worth whatever the current purchase price is. If you can get it on sale, great, but if not it'll still be worth your investment if you enjoy tactica and dynamic gameplay, and want to experience the most innovative shooter in recent memory.",

By dropping the price of the base package, slightly improving the connection issues, and keeping up with the free content, they've won me over. I have yet to re-attempt the Casual playlist in PvP, but my experiences over the last two days with PvE/Terrorist Hunt have been nothing short of a blast!  Changes since my last review: - I have yet to experience a CTD in over 8hrs of gameplay. - Longest wait time for co-op multiplayer was 3 minutes. Lag is nonexistant. - A decent mixture of new and experienced players in PvE. - Optimisation changes mean it runs better than before at higher settings!  For the first time ever, I can wholeheartedly change this review to a positive, and would now recommend the game to anyone interested in PvE multiplayer. At €15, it's a damn steal!   Original Review below for posterity: ----------------------------------------------------  Disclaimer: ------------ I love this game. I played and loved the Beta, but other games took monetary priority until now. ------------  I played the Situations for about an hour and a half, and some solo Terrorist Hunt for about an hour. Feeling like I'd practiced enough, I joined a multiplayer lobby. It went something like this:  I spent twenty minutes of my third hour in the game waiting to play a match. Having finally been granted an audience with the 'Casual' playlist, which ironically now consists entirely of highly experienced players, I was super-stoked to get into a proper versus match.   I got to play exactly one match.  What happened next was lag, a disconnect, more lag, and then finally a crash to desktop. All in under an hour of online. I'm now sitting here waiting to see if Steam will give me a refund. I just can't recommend the game in this state.  Ubisoft, fix your mess please.  This game has stupendous potential, but for €60 it's currently ATROCIOUS.",

I was tempted to buy it but after the last few days I've come to realise the game itself is now becoming dated, the player base dimishing so for the DLC to be released I personally think the DEV's should have had a look at the numbers of players before commiting to creating it or indeed any DLC's. Sometimes it takes ages to find enough players to go to multiplayer or Terrorist Hunt and you can't even start it by going it alone, it onlystarts when theres a full group so your basically left playing the single player 'Situations'. I will recommend the game however suggest finding a few friends to play along side to be able to play for any decent amount of time.",

After playing a proper three hours of matchmaking, I can assure you that the servers are completely and totally unusable. During the beta, I thought that the matchmaking system would be redone, but that turned out to be completely false. They barely polished the servers at all. Even after almost a month of the game being on the market, the game still crashes after attempting to join a match in progress, and sometimes exits out after playing through a match. The gameplay, however, is entirely fantastic. I absolutely love the operator system, but the fact that you can barely even play with other people ruins the entire base of the game; teamwork. I would not reccomend this game for people who want to play against other members until Ubisoft fixes their servers (which is likely to never happen).  EDIT (April 17th, 2016) - After having refunded this game for several months now, I decided to come back during the free weekend which just ended recently. During this time, I was able to find out that the servers are fully functional, and matches are easy to come by. As stated before, the game in itself has no flaws, from communication, to teamwork, to balancing. I have repurchased the game as of now, and would recommend it to anyone who seeks a strategical shooter like CS:GO, or to people that like the fun experiences of Battlefield. This, however, is not a 'CoD-like' shooter in the slightest. If you rush in or are impatient, you will die. I love this game.",

That said, even if you squad up with a group of randoms, the experience is unequaled. If you have a group of friends to play with, it only gets better.   Year 2 was recently announced, which means this game will get continued support for a very long time. This is good news because I can't think of a better shooter that I've played in recent memory.

CS:GO is slightly better, designed to be a non-grinding type of game where you just earn money, buy guns, and shoot people. There is a bomb but all in all, it's close to realism but not quite. RSS on the other hand, trumps everything. If you are looking for a realistic, counterterrorist vs terrorist, strategic FPS, this is meant for you. If you can make some friends, grab a mic and start running down the different attacking or defending tactics, you will have a lot of fun. You really need to think when it comes to this game. Probably the most important part of this game is the teamwork. Communication and loadouts are key. The loadouts MUST be balanced, that way your team is more effectively.

            "review_text": "I haven't had so much fun with a FPS for a long, long time...  Putting this quick &amp; simple:  If you're looking for a fun tactical FPS game, with a totally destructable environment, then look no further.   You have two options for this game, you can play it Terrorist Hunt (kind of Coop) with friends, solo or matchmaking or decide play it more competetive with either Casual or Ranked, or you can mix them how you want and when you want  Information about this Game:  You have 20 basic operators, each to be unlocked by gaining renown (in-game currency gained by playing the game and completing the objectives) consisted in 4 operators per squad, Spetnaz, GIGN, GSG9, FBI SWAT, SAS,  They're divided in two Teams, Attackers &amp; Defenders. Each round, there is a 'Insertion Phase', where you have 40 seconds to use your drones for scouting (attacking team) or reinforce the sorrounding (defenders team)  Then when the 'Insertion Phase' ends, the match starts and has a countdown of 4 minutes  When that part starts, the attackers will have to go and secure the objective, which can be one of the three following:  Secure Zone: You have to get in the objective and hold it against the defenders, or by clearing them out  Disarming Bomb: You need to disarm the bomb, but you can also win by eliminating all defenders or vice-versa  Extract Hostage: You have to go grab the hostage and escort him safe to the extraction zone, the game also ends if the attackers kill him accidentally or the defenders decide to put him out of his misery  The special about this game, is that it plays like a chess, each operator is unique and has a special ability, in the Attacker team there is one operator called Sledge from the SAS, which has a Breaching hammer that destroys walls and floors quickly (you can get kills with it too if you dare) and there is Pulse, a fast operator in the Defender team from SWAT armed with a Heartbeat sensor that kinda works like a 'Wallhack'. You have Twitch in the Attacker team of GIGN that has a shock drone that can destroy cameras and gadgets and at same time provide intel and hurt the Defender team with it's lazer. On the other side there is Kapkan, the Spetnaz soldier which has lazer traps that sometimes can caught the Attackers unaware and by surprise guarding the rooms where they're implemented  Besides the 20 basic operators, there are a total of 8 Season operators, 2 for each Team, and next year there will be 8 more in 2017.  They are harder to get and need more renown and time to unlock, but they're free and you aren't forced to buy the Season pass to get access to them, you just have to play more so you get enough renown to unlock them  In the first Season Pass, there are 4 'DLC Squads'  JTF2 - Canadian Joint Task Force   Buck - Attacker 2 Armor 2 Speed armed with a Rifle &amp; Shotgun Barrel which he can switch quickly between rifle and shotgun so he can provide 'murder holes' for tactical advantage  Frost - Defender 2 Armor 2 Speed Operator armed with bear traps that can caught the unaware Attacker roamers, she also has a Super 90 Shotgun (maybe one of the best shotguns in the game)  Navy Seals - USA  Blackbeard - Attacker 2 Armor 2 Speed with a selection of good Rifles, his special ability is a rifle shield that can protect him for a few shots (he used to be overpowered, now he was nerfed to oblivion)  Valkyrie - Defender 2 Armor 2 Speed - Has the SPAS 12 as shotgun or MPX as SMG, her ability consists of 3 blackeye cameras, which can be put anywere and provide extra intel in the room where they're inserted  BOPE - Brasillian Special Forces  Capitão - Attacker 1 Armor 3 Speed - You can choose between a good support LMG or the Para 303, his ability is a crossbow that can either shoot a fire bold into an area or provide smoke support to the Attacking Team  Caveira - Defender 1 Armor 3 Speed - Her ability is very situational, but once managed she can turn the tide of the battle. Her ability consists in 'Interrogating' the downed foe in order to extract info about the wherebouts of the opossite team, but in order to use it she has to down one attacker and use the ability. She has a good silenced pistol that helps in that aspect and she can temporary run a bit more silent while her ability is on  Now to the last  Japanese SAT  Hibana - Attacker 1 Armor 3 Speed - She can fire a special pellet which can melt the reinforced walls, providing entry points where it would not be possible in other way then using Thermite from SWAT FBI, armed with Supernova shotgun and a small and high RoF machine pistol  Echo - Defender 1 Armor 3 Speed - Has a flying drone with night vision that can stun the enemy so he can take them out  There will be 4 more DLC squads next year, now getting into Pro's and Con's  The Good:  Good Graphics Fully Destructable Environment Each match is played different Use of rappeling to get inside the buildings. Tactical aprouch of the game, you can use flashbangs to temporarily stun the oponent, create holes in the walls with shotguns to shoot the enemy on the other room, give cover with shields, use c4 to wreck the shields Good amount of operators, each own unique on it's own way Each map has it's own diferent zones for the objectives, giving lot of replayability value to the game There is no 'p2w' in this game, you can get everything there is in the game for just playing it  The Bad:  The netcode of the game is a complete mess Peekers advantage The Matchmaking is also a mess, you can get a team of lvl 20 against lvl +100 or viceversa, the more balanced way you can get for this game is to play in Ranked but there are also some problems there I've heard",

            "review_text": "PROS:   The game is fun when it works, a lot of fun. The community is great! Love all the team players playing the game. Which makes it hard to down vote. BUT:  CONS:  The final product is not much better than the beta. For a 'BETA' the game was great, but as a triple A title and a price of $60, I expected a lot of the issues in the beta to be fixed- I was wrong.  - The match making still has issues.  - Players still get stuck in loading screens.  - The menus for pretty much everything are not very well designed or intuitive at all.  - The game has been out for 3 days and the Ubisoft servers have already been down/crashed multiple times rendering the game unplayable since even most of the (very limited) single player requires it to be online - Wall physcis, game physics can be a little... weird sometimes. - Game crashes randomly - TOO MANY PROBLEMS FOR $60  PvP:  -Assuming no one crashes, gets DCed or stuck in a loading screen, they are fun and intense.  Terrorist Hunts: - The AI on 'Hard' is really not that 'hard' at all, but the AI on 'Realistic' is all-knowing and will headshot you through smoke, a wall and a barraicade with one bullet.  - Spawning is horrible. You can clear an entire building only to have to go back and clear it again because the AI will spawn in rooms randomly- sometimes directly infront of you on screen, but most of the time it's directly behind you.  ----UPDATE FOR THE PEOPLE IN MY COMMENTS----  Response for Mad Ninja - As stated at the beginning of my review, I said I was going to keep it short and simple- hints why I did not go into detail about the things you are requesting. If you want an indepth review, go read the curators reviews or some gaming websites review. Mine was just a simple snapshot of what stood out from the game to me.   As for your comment about spawning, I have seen [In game] [With my own eyes] enemy AI spawn directly infront of me inside rooms. I have also been 100% sure a room was clear (Only one way in) and while camping that room, have had enemy spawn directly behind me and kill me.  The aiming of bots in 'Realistic' is astrocious. I have watched multiple death cams of myself and end of round death cams, where the AI 'should' have had no idea where the player was located but was able to get off a headshot instantly. The difficulty 'hard' on terrorist hunt is not that hard at all, while the increase in difficulty to realistic makes it nearly impossible. The AI -HAS- changed since the Beta as it was no where near as difficult to complete on realsitc mode during the Beta.   As for the game physics and wall physics, I am referring mostly to the damage that is done by explosives. In many cases the damage of explosives seems to just completly ignore walls entirely and kill anything regardless of material of the wall or location. I have also on occasion had random things [Walls, barriers, barbed wire, equipment, etc] blow up for seemingly no reason or all. Or I have seen a single grenade blow up WAY too much in one room/multiple areas.  Characters also sometime clip through walls and get stuck in the maps. I can recall two occasions where other players have been downed, and upon revival they were stuck in the floor and unable to move. This broke the game as the player was not allowed to attack the enemy, resulting in having to wait 8 minutes for the round timer to expire.  Clipping through walls is a HORRIBLE problem for a game that allows players to shoot through so many surfaces. If players [Legs and weapon barrels] can be seen through walls, it gives the opponent an unfair advantage as they can just shoot through the wall without the other player having any idea he is there.  As for the matchmaking issues, I must repeatedly click to join both multiplayer and terrorist hunts. My game will 'act' as if it is trying to find a new game, tell me it is joining and then kick me out to the main screen for seemingly no reason. I have also had multiple games get stuck in loading screens, seen multiple other players get dropped from games and had games completly crash for no reason at all.  Plus the way the servers update is way to slow for this type of game. The lagg can be absolutely horrible with people and enemies rubberbanding all over the place.  As for the menus, you are correct, that is a personal preferance- but if new players of the game have to ask older players how to upgrade their characters or how to get into the screen to kick inacctive players, there is a problem. Plus some of the menus require the player to use the arrow keys instead of just using the mouse which just doesn't make senes to me. You are right it is not 'game breaking' but definetly annoying and on top of all the other problems... You get my point.  Response to Bucie-B: How about you read the review before you comment. I clearly listed Pros first. If yet very short, they are there.  I honestly hate having to down vote this game. It is incredible fun when it works. But with all the issues with the game and networking.. I cannot and will not recommend to anyone that they spend $60 on this game. It just simply is not worth it.",

            "review_text": "I really like this game, and I've played it a lot since it came out, but Ubisoft needs to get their ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ together when it comes to connectivity issues. I'm sick and tired of getting dropped out of ranked matches exclusevily because of Ubisoft's ♥♥♥♥♥♥ servers and that automatically causing me to lose a rank. It's nearly impossible to find a match, ranked or casual, in which 1 or more players don't get dropped and, sometimes, 5 players or more will get dropped at once. Not to mention that it takes for ♥♥♥♥ing ever to find a ranked match, so when you get dropped on the 2nd round after waiting for 10 minutes to find a match, it's pretty frustrating.  This game is a lot of fun, but connectivity issues are ruining the experience for me. I'll give it a negative review until Ubisoft can fix their servers.  EDIT, January 12th, 2016: The game has been out for well over a month at this point and the connectivity issues persist. Constant drops on casual and ranked games that cause you to get banned and make the rest of the match unfair, matches taking WAY too long to start after all players connect, matches taking way too long to be found and other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. The issues aren't as bad as they were on launch, but that's not saying much, since the game was bordering on being unplayable when it came out. To put it in perspective, I would say connectivity issues on this game, as of right now, are hardly acceptable for a Beta, much less for a AAA $60 game that already lacks content. Oh, and it crashes quite frequently, too.",

            "review_text": "I wish Steam would let me rate games with a neutral rating instead of just a thumbs up or thumbs down: Rainbow Six Siege can be a decent and enjoyable game, BUT... it's not a Rainbow Six game (lore and gameplay-wise) and not much of a 'tactical shooter' like we saw from the original installments, and other examples like the SWAT series, etc. From the series that brought you pre-planning, realism, high customizability and weapons that YOU must control for more accuracy, Siege turned it into a 'competitive multiplayer' downgrade, with arcadey character movement -  still smoother and more precise than other games like CoD and Battlefield  - and removed offline experience with friendly AI (which is, frankly, an insult to old fans like me) at full-price.  -  Let's get the pros out of the way.  - Destructible environment is cool and accurate (which is the main thing that makes the game a bit less stale and give it a bit of more personality), rappel system, kamikaze terrorists, non-linear gameplay and operators with different abilities and paramilitary gadgets. Level design is also worth mentioning. Controls are responsive and the game doesn't feel like an unoptimized console port with stutters and lack of anti-cheats. You finally did something right, Ubisoft.  -  Lack of a proper singleplayer mode, my biggest gripe  - No friendly AI (either basic or AI to give orders to) like, you know, all Rainbow Six titles before this one. Forget about Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta and milestones. You are all by yourself clearing entire buildings, and even succeed in that! To enjoy this game and make it more realistic, you're forced to jump into multiplayer, where you gotta pray people play tactically and don't use cheats or troll around. You also hope this game will never die, since the playerbase might move into other games in the future, thus 60 beloved bucks wasted. As you can see, I'm not the MP-type of player. Obviously, every game is so much better when playing with friends, but SP is a different experience AND one that lasts forever.  -  Realistic?  - Character movement is arcadey and guns don't have much recoil (or at least, no effort needed to shoot accurately). Ability to lean left and right very fast while shooting accurately with long bursts, 1 second insta-melee kills, aiming down sight while proning-and-moving, still 100% accurate while aiming and moving, no movement and accuracy limits when injured, ability to stop reloading by sprinting. AI terrorists can also be cheating aimboters sometimes, and other times they incompetently do nothing, and for a tactical/realistic/whatever game it's a problem that is not yet fixed.  -  Pricetag and exclusive content . This is a game I consider the most 'cashgrab'-y from Ubisoft. It's a tiny little game sold at 60 bucks (it's cheaper now, but exclusive content are still a problem) and microtransactions containing overpriced gun skins and boosts. Want to know the biggest problem of them all?   Time-limited content and time-limited season passes!  Holy ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥. I feel sorry for the people who paid full-price for a game, only to realize they can't unlock ALL content, unless they open their wallets at the right time. You might say 'they're only cosmetics, so you shouldn't care', but a big fan of a specific videogame wants to unlock everything and beat it 100%. Doesn't matter if it's something that affects gameplay or something that can only be collected. Devs like Ubisoft, Blizzard, etc. are doing the most cancerous business model for their games.  - Just a personal con:  there's lack of mod support.  - This game could be a lot better and varied with custom maps, definitely.  -  No quick-chat function   (à la CSGO) - for people who don't use mics/don't have time to write in text chat.  -  Hitmarkers, kill indicators/announcer (that can't be disabled) and weapon skins.  - The cancer of today's FPS games. They don't belong in a 'tactical shooter' game.  -  Port-forwarding in 2016?  - To make a party and invite friends you need to either open some ports in your router, enable uPnP, or adding your static IP in the DMZ (unsafe) if you happen to have a 'strict NAT' according to the game.  The review says I've played 1 hr of this game, but I played the alpha, closed beta, open beta and the free weekend. The devs made some survey for us alpha testers to give feedback about the game, but from alpha to final release the game didn't change much. I gave this game 4 chances and I also tried to force myself to like it. It's not a bad game, but just disappointing. I couldn't get into it, I'm sorry. I will update my review if future updates will improve things, and will play again once its price drops. 60 bucks is too much for me.  PS: I've been told so many times (mostly experiencing internet's psychological warfare wannabe) that I should not 'go back to the past' and forget about the old Rainbow Six games and singleplayer games in general. That's funny, because the competitive multiplayer scene came around at the same time as the birth of the Rainbow Six franchise. That's hypocrisy, isn't it? My point is that the original Rainbow Six concept is still original, because it's hardly used, and I wish to see it back with modern videogame technology  (since the original games are, sadly, outdated. If Ubisoft doesn't feel like developing a new old-school Rainbow Six game, at least just give me a remastered of the trilogy with better controls and AI).  Just disappointed by the fact that the series has gradually gone down this route, developing the same core concept that we often see in most other games these days.   TL;DR - With no friendly AI, pre-planning, customization and realistic gameplay, this is literally a downgrade from past games (sold at the same price + season pass and microtransactions). In fact, Siege mostly focuses on competitive PvP - which is sadly becoming a trend these days - and 'good-enough' Terrorist Hunt mode.",

EDIT: In the essence of it all it's my opinion. Someone else may love this game and think it's worth every penny. As I have stated, the game is good and I do like it, my only gripe is the value for money. The AI isn't the best during single player segments and I hate how you can't pick your map/side (attack or defence) when creating either a private or single player game.  All in all it's the little things, however I stand by my previous statement that it isn't worth the price. You have other AAA games like Fallout 4 and Just Cause 3 priced at £39.99 and there is no justification for the extra £10.00 in Siege's case.  EDIT 2: Yes, I know that they have dropped the price but my opinion still stands. It is good of them to realise that they were overcharging but it shouldn't be like that in the first place. The current price is more than reasonable and due to that fact I can now recommend this game.",

I'm leaving the review as it was to avoid resetting the stats, but I thought I'd just add an update at the top: Ubisoft did a fantastic job at fixing this game. Play it.   (Written in January 2016)  This is a multiplayer, team-focused, strategic shooter, AAA title, 60$ game. In which you can't reach the multiplayer part 9 times on 10 because of the netcode and servers issues. But buying the Season's Pass apparently works just fine. January 2016. Game has been released in early December 2015. Maybe in one month, it'll work. But there will be nobody left to play with. Ubisoft, if that's the way you're going, I'm not following and I want a refund.  I can't recommend buying, at this price and in this state, Rainbow 6: Siege.  ====================================================  Pros: the game is everything a strategic, slow-paced FPS aims to be. The game may needs some tuning and adjustement, but really minor stuff (often loudly requested by the community).  Mid: your teammates (and/or yourself) can be phenomenal mindplayers and teamworkers or all the way down to basic rushers and campers. This game  requires  you to cooperate and communicate, a concept that is sometimes forgotten. You'll have to improve yourself and do what you can with what you'll get.  Cons: the servers are in cardboard and the matchmaking is in plastic. For a game that offers maybe two hours of solo content, you can tell it's bad. This baby's only a few months old, and Ubisoft is apparently trying to kill it even before it matures. On the bright side, the server issues of Siege will make you feel better about any other's games server issues. ",

            "review_text": "Since I am bored, I am going to write a long, full review of this game.  Overall, this game has a fantastic concept that is (or soon will be) trashed by greedy money grabbing tactics and horrible severs.  When you start up the game, you have 3 options.   1. Missions that are pretty much just tutorials to help newbies understand the game mechanics. 2. The cancerous Terrorist Hunt Mode 3. Multiplayer  The tutorial missions are fine as they are in my opinion, although some seem a bit too difficult especially since the majority of people that play those missions are people fairly new to the game.  Anyways, on to the actual gameplay!  MULTIPLAYER  This is basically what 99% of the game is, or at least what is focused on, so you would expect it to be flawless, right?   Haha, yea...  You join the queue to get into a match. The recommended time is 30-50 seconds. That seems pretty amazing, but no..  Everyone get's into the match and gets to pick the operator of their choice. Everything goes smoothly. But every single time.. there is always that one guy that is playing on a potato with bent paper clips sticking out of it trying to pick up the signal from his 1 KB/s internet plan. The game takes 5 minutes just to start. This gets super frustrating considering each round only lasts 2 minutes on average.  PROS:  +The multiplayer has lot's of content, fully destructive maps and intense fire fights. +Killing enemies is difficult and satisfying. +Literally no match is the same.  CONS:  -Uplay  -Potato servers that make everyone lag and sometimes causes players to get disconnected  -Godawful netcode (What's that? You shot that guy in the head 17 times and saw blood go everywhere!? He still has 67 health, even though 1 headshot counts as a death)  -Cheaters everywhere. I shoot a guy 15 times and then it says he has full health.  -Frost's shotgun  -Lag is insane  You'll be eyeing a corner, making the best choke point the world has ever seen. You are so focused that even if someone appears for just 1 microsecond, you'll be able to get them.  BAM, you're dead!  You're extremely confused on what just happened. Did someone get behind you? The killcam comes on and you see that the guy came around the corner and was standing right in the open for 5 seconds, and shot you. The lag caused you to not even see him appear! FANTASTIC! (And no, my internet is fine. Thanks for not asking)  -The level 3 guy that has no idea what he's doing and ends up shooting the hostage point blank with a shotgun because logic.  -Buck is severely underpowered. The skeleton key is weak, and his assualt rifle recoils so much you can barely shoot anything.  -You'll be put in a match against fully cooridinated teams that are basically level 150 that will wreck you every single time.  -When you spawn as the attackers, take 5 steps to the left, and get sniped from a window.  -Defenders that jump out of the building and start shooting at you 15 seconds into the match.  -Lack of customization. Each operator has around 2 guns they can pick from, and 9/10 times one gun is 100x times better than the other so there's really no point in choosing.  -25,000 renown for the latest operators that you can get if you buy the season pass. What does this mean? Are the next operators going to be 50K, 100K? Don't force people to buy your season pass. (Keep in mind that even 25K is a bit high considering you only get like 200 renown a match).   Okay, yea.. playing multiplayer on this game is just going to leave you feeling unsatisfied. Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of epic moments that happen, but it's severely outweighed by the all the previously listen bad things.  Time to review the.. ugh..  TERRORIST HUNT  Choose to play alone or with a team, with 3 different difficulties. The harder the difficulty, the smarter the AI.  PROS:  +It's fun.. I guess.. +Good for warming up before going into multiplayer matches  CONS:  -It sucks  -Suicide bombers In a game where a couple well-placed shots means instant death, these bombers are a pain in the ♥♥♥. You'll be cautiously scoping a hallway, when a bomber appears and starts sprinting towards you. You put an entire magazine of ammo into his chest, but it doesn't do anything. He then goes boom-boom in your face, causing you to lose.  There are so many cons about it that I'm too lazy to list them all.  FINAL VERDICT:  5/10 if you're a casual lonely player like me. Probably an 7 or 8/10 if you got an actual squad to play with.  I'll update this as the new content slides in and more patches get released. I have faith considering they are aware the servers are crap and they are fixing bugs, like the invisible Kapkan laser exploit.",

EDIT (8/26/16): So, I gave this gamesome time to see if they could fix some of the bugs... guess not. Instead of fixing the bugs and connection issues to make this game more stable, they decided to break it even MORE.

More time is spent in matchmaking than in game in r6 siege.  This game is largely unfinished and like many other unfinished games, has been labelled as a finished one. I can accept that ranked play is in Beta and should be reviewed as such, but the entire game as a whole is a bit broken and as a whole, should have a rating below its current.  EDIT - I have been randomly kicked off of ranked matches and temporarily banned 3 times now, I'm actually losing ranks because of this game's flawed 'toxic community' paranoia. If you're going to temporarily ban people for prematurely leaving games, perhaps exclude those who have been thrown off games by unstable connection to unstable servers from being banned.  EDIT 2 - randomly losing connection to ranked games happens every single day that i play the game now, as well as game-breaking black screen crashes to desktop as well as a black screen glitch on any gamemode, getting temporarily banned from ranked is a common occurance and often happens more than once a day.

Also, I cant join one of my friends' squad or he cant join mine (&amp; we both have NAT open). When the black ice update came out, I was excited because it stated that they fixed most of the connection issues when joining the squad and in general esp. the (2-0x00000067) error. Unfortunately, this issue isn't fixed, which is a load of baloney.  Imo, the connection issue is what I really hate, because I really like playing with my friends. Before the update it worked somehow when joining the squad, by being online on uplay and accepting the invite from friends' uplay chat and the game will automatically open and join the squad, but now somehow that doesnt work anymore because the error now pops up.  (Ubisoft you should really fix this, but I somehow doubt it due to your reputation.)  Anyway, If you play with friends or with a friend, there is a slight chance you could end up not playing due to the squad error, just a small warning. There are chances that one of your friends will be able to connect to your squad or you'll be able to connect to theirs. I'm irritated by those squad invite issues or whatnot so therefore, I cannot recommend this game at the moment.

I really miss good single player campaigns in the days where multiplayer is the entire focus, Vegas managed both. If nobody I knew was online I'd switch over to campain or training sims with the AI team and hunt terrorists.   The gameplay is okay, it works but in this day and age of perfected annual shooters, is that a positive worth mentioning? The modes consist of breach and clear, sometimes collect a hostage, others destroy a bomb. The maps are extremely linear and offer a minimal amount of destructive enviroment except set areas, there's not many of them on the base game so varaity is at a minimum.  Graphically the game falls on the middle, their not shocking but they won't show off your new graphics cards prowess either. Some of the textures stand out as noticably bad while others pop nice and sharp, the character model designs for some of the operators look clunky and in real life unmanagable,  2008 saw the year of Vegas, it feels like Ubisoft decided that was just too much effort and settled on the bare bones approach, gone are character customisation instead opting for pre-made 'Operators' (Don't get used to havign a favourite, if someone else on your team picks the same one you lose out using it.) Gone are intelligent AI who instead of covering and running, wave at you or stand in the designated area. Gone are the AI team mates, want to practice the few modes this title offers? Tough do it alone.This really is as stripped down as it gets, screaming laziness at the top of it's lungs.  I actually refunded the game but it was kindly gifted to me later, i do not however feel i made a mistake asking for my money back.   So far the game ranks around a 3/10, it feels shallow and cold. If this title retailed at £20 instead of double I may of been a little kinder but at the price it was released and the time waiting between this and the last installment is not worth it. The release is no more than a beta for what should of came in it's place and apart from hardcore fans of this, no one will really come back for more.",

Not to mention they took a page out of Evolve's book by charging $30 for a season pass that doesn't really get you anything. The season pass is a complete rip off, don't buy it.  Next, there is no campaign. This is RainbowSix, there has to be a campaign. And on top of that they removed a lot of the features that made rainbowSix great, like removing your suppressor during the game.   There's a lot of potential in this game.

I'm talking about the netcode, it is terrible, I checked out if there's anything you can do about it, but we will have to wait for them to fix it. There is about a 150 millisecond delay. that's over 2 seconds, that is so crucial in a FPS, especially when it is a very strategic game where every milllisecond counts. There is even a delay from being shot to taking the damage, so you can see one shot then die, watch the kill cam and they unloaded a clip into you. This would be one of the best games ever to me, but it isn't playable at the moment. Stopped playing for quite a while due to these issues, came back because of the update, the net code is at a solid 4 second delay now, and hackers are more rampant then ever. And nothing is being done about it, so I will try again in 6 more months. It still isn't getting any better, the reporting system is very slow, and people have figured out how to abuse the already bad netcode by having a 200+ ping they gain an even greater advantage for time, they will have about 3-6 second over you, so you won't see shots coming or you see someone at the bottom of the stiars and get knifed by them, and on their screen their behind you. Wonderful idea for a game, but the netcode still makes it so sadly unplayable. Sadly after stopping playing for several months, nothing has changed in the least, the net code is still terrible and it is still very rampant with hackers, it has a great concept and I would love to be able to play this game and have fun, but becuase of these game breaking issues I cannot attempt to have fun with this game.",

            "review_text": "In true Ubisoft fashion, Rainbow Six: Siege over-promises and under-delivers in it's latest 'tactical' shooter, and I use that word loosely. What looked to be a fresh take on a saturated FPS market, Siege captured my interest first with its enticing and slightly cringey E3 trailer. In the demonstration, a laughable stereotype of a 'gamer' voice chats with his teammates about strategies and callouts as he and his friends blast their way into a building to rescue a hostage, with superb visuals and lighting, and most cover being showcased as destructable. The final product though is an embarassment coming from a AAA developer and costing a mere 80 ♥♥♥♥ING dollars CDN, which will also be the last money I spend on an Ubisoft title, and I'll explain why.  To start, the final product looks 'good enough'. The intense visuals and lighting effects shown at E3 were scrapped for rather bland console style graphics, and lighting has no aspect on gameplay whatsoever. The free-form destructable environment was also thrown in the trash for preset 'breach panels' in floors, meaning games will be fairly stale and play out the same after you've experienced most of what the game has to offer. Instead of having custom player setups, the game opted to have special characters called 'operators' who have unique weapons and gear, which sounds good on paper, however the asymmetrical classes are not all completely balanced, and some are just far too good not to have on a round, making team composition basically nonexistant. Remember how in the E3 trailer the team was planning between rounds, and they even had a playbook to scribble on? Yeah that didn't make it either, and even if it did, you won't be planning anything in this game, because despite bearing the prestigious 'Tom Clancy' name, this game is about as tactical as any run of the mill Call of Duty rat maze shooter, minus the killstreaks of course. Teammates aren't going to stick to any plan, even in ranked, because this game is too fast paced and twitchy for it.   There is an awkward preparation phase between each round that allows defenders to reinforce walls and setup their gear, while attackers send in remote camera drones to scout the area. Again, this sounds good on paper, however when you have 5 tiny drones scouting constantly against 5 players that are standing around holding buttons down to set up their gear, 1 drone is 9/10 times is going to get in and find the objectives and ID players, meaning every prep phase is basically the same and boring. Defenders stand around way too much setting up gear, and drones will always find the objective on small maps, especially when a player knows the preordained spawn points.  Hostage mode is a complete waste of time, you'll never drag a hostage through a gauntlet indoors like in E3 when you can just jump out the window and run 10 feet to the rescue point, and I wish I was overstating that case, because most hostage rounds play out exactly like that. Also there was clear time and thought put into the outskirts of maps, but they NEVER get used because defenders are not allowed to leave without getting marked for all to see through walls and having their screens blurred with an annoying orange tint and the text 'YOU HAVE BEEN SPOTTED' flashing on their screen. Forget defending hostage rescue points, this game doesn't want you to play that way, it's absurd and insulting to the genre and Tom Clancy name. Counter Strike offers a far better hostage rescue mode, and it uses an ancient game engine, what's Ubisoft's excuse?  In the end, Siege feels half-♥♥♥♥♥ compared to what was promised at E3, there's plenty of things that need fixed in the game that shouldn't have to be asked for, like automatic team killer kicking, map voting, and other blatant oversights like the hostage mode. Coming from a company that has no shortage of resources, Siege is yet another bland, soulless shooter made by people that probably cared but most likely had corporate dumb ♥♥♥♥s meddling in the development process. If you want a real tactical shooter you're probably better off playing Counter Strike or even Insurgency, this game will dazzle the mainstream gamer and disappoint the true FPS fan.",

            "review_text": "I absolutely love this game, but can't give it a positive review because of the reasons below. I used to play Counterstrike a lot and switched over to this and Overwatch, so I hope that gives a little background into my opinion. I guess the easiest way to explain my thoughts is a simple Pro-Con list.  Pros -graphics look amazing, and run at a consistant 60 fps on my PC, even at the highest settings. -sounds are really well done. Every gun is satisfying to shoot and reload. You can easily tell where enemies are coming from if you pay attention. -Level design is great. Each one has multiple floors and dozens of entrances to choose from, giving you a variety of options on how you can take the objective. -gameplay is ridiculously fun. Seriously it feels really badass breaching through the ceiling/walls with gunfire all around you as your team pushes in, not to mention strategizing a plan with your team beforehand. -Great community too, 99% of the games I've played I've had a great time talking with my teammates, and even the enemy team. Besides the occasional hacker, everyone is a good sport and they're open to new players and willing to show you the ropes. -Gun customization is fun  Cons -Queue times can range from immediately jumping into a game to waiting more than 10-15 minutes. Sometimes after waiting forever to join I can back out and restart the search and suddenly join a game after 12 seconds. -In game credits called renown: you don't get the operators that you can play as when you get the game. you have to unlock them through saving up renown and buying them in the operators page. Most only cost 500-2000, but the newer operators cost 25,000. Each. and that doesn't include weapon attachments, or skins, or anything. Just the basic equipment and gun(s). Getting all the attachments you want on a gun can go up to 800+, and even more if you want to be able to have a choice between different sights/muzzles/etc when picking at the start of a round. -So you may be wondering how fast can you earn renown in order to get this stuff, well luckily there are some single player situations that grant you 200 renown for each of the 3 objectives you complete in them. there's 10 situations each so you can get 6000 total if you really want to grind that. If you want to play multiplay you also get renown, but it's only 100-300 renown each game, and depends a lot on wether your team wins or loses.  -To expand on the last point, the game feels like a grind at times when you're focused on gaining renown by playing as many games as possible, but since it takes close to half an hour to find, play, and finish a game, you're only getting maybe 800 every hour. Not to mention times where you get randomly disconnected for no reason or even worse, stuck on a perpetual loading screen that won't let you back out unless you alt+f4. -So you want to play one of the new operators that came out? well I hope you're happy with paying either $5 of in-game currency for each one, or paying an additional $30 for the season pass, even though this is a full price game at $50.  TL;DR: They have a really, REALLY, great game here that's hidden under a pile of ♥♥♥♥. It has, by far, the best online multiplayer gamemodes I've ever played but you have to deal with their ♥♥♥♥ servers, and grindy in-game economy, to really appreciate it. Maybe after they've fixed their terrible servers and either made it easier to gain renown or got rid of the system all together, I can consciously say that I'd reccomend this game.",

Good luck getting you and four other friends to connect the same party without playing musical party leaders for half an hour. Once that's done, experience the joy of watching Ubisoft's servers try and fail to connect your party with other players. On the chance that you successfully make it into a game, get ready for lack luster gameplay and a terrible netcode.   Goodbye custom loadouts, hello weapon restricting 'Operator' classes. Why can't attackers use SMGs? Why can't defenders use grenades? Why don't any weapon attachments I unlock transfer to 'recruit' classes or any other operator that uses the same gun? Why can't I choose my own weapons? Because ♥♥♥♥ you that's why. Not that any of that really matters since every gun is a 1-headshot kill, so each class chooses whatever gun has the fastest firing rate, slaps a holosight on that ♥♥♥♥♥, and goes to town.  If that wasn't bad enough Ubisoft's veteran coders implemented a wonderful nostalgic netcode where even players with less than 100 ping fall victim to getting killed by players who haven't appeared on their screen yet. Beware of traversing hallways and stairs, as anyone who peaks around a corner will have a full 1-2 seconds to fill you with bullets before you so much as see their head coming into view. The fact that Ubisoft was ok with shipping the game with a netcode this bad simply astounds me.  Congratulations Ubisoft, of the hundreds of games I've purchased in Steam, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege is the first game I've regretted spending money on. This was the first new Ubisoft title I had tried in quite some time, now I remember why. This experience has definately turned me off from getting The Division.

Then I ran into a hacker, then another one, and another one, this went on game after game. I then got tired of the horrible hitboxes and peakers advantage. My friends always talked trash about the game, but I told them no, the game is still good. I finally got tired of the game, tired of all the hackers, tired of all the horrible hitboxes.   This game is horrible, one of the worst games I have ever played.   The first problem is that this game has no anti cheat. The anti cheat is horrible and bans almost no one. I have ran into the same hacker multiple times, the guy blatantly cheats and does not get banned, I even had video proof, nothing happned to him. So all I can think off is that Rainbow six siege supports hackers. Also I was banned for a minute for hacking, even though I wasnt. If you can find a game without hackers, then its incredibly fun, but sadly, most games you play   Another problem is the hitboxes. They are complete s+++. The guy could be standing still, you aim for his head and shoot, and the game wont register it. Every time I get in a gunfight, I put 30 bullets into him at point blank range, I either die or the last bullet kills, same for the other guy. The last game I played, I had peakers advantage, I put 20 bullets to the guys chest and 10 to the head. Guess what happned... I died.   Another problem is that this game is based on luck, not skill  Do not even think about getting this game, its horrible. AND they put it down to 15$ to support hackers. A guy gets banned, and can easily rejoin for a measly 15$.   Spend your money on something better.  *edit - Even after the new anti cheat, there is still plenty of hackers. Right after it was introduced, there was a lot less hackers, I got my old rank back to, but in a week, a new swarm of hackers came in. Trash like that needs to die. If you can find a game without hackers, then its incredibly fun, but sadly, most games you play there will be a hacker.  Last game I played, we got put in Brazilian servers, like we normally are even though we are in the middle of the U.S, my friend threw a c4, it rubberbanded back and killed him.",

There is a temporary fix to this, though sometimes it will force you to restart rather than fixing the audio issue.   Crashes are; in my opinion, the biggest issue with this game.

            "review_text": "This game has great features and gameplay but few of us can actually enjoy that because of the bugs and Ubisofts lack of care. While playing the game you will start to notice how some things are not quite right, like:  - you got killed with headshot while loking down from cover, you didn't see the enemy, in killcam you see that your WHOLE head was sticking out, reason - your cameras is at gun level, your head will always peak from cover, this so annoying beacuse when you crouch behind shields (deployable cover) you cant see behind it while enemy can see your head!  -you see the enemy, you shoot at him, hit him in the head, blood is splattering from his head, he shoots back and kills you, killcam shows either that 1. you didnt shoot at all, he saw you and shot first 2. you were shooting at air while he wasn't actually there, he spotted you because of your fire 3. you shot 10% of bullets you actually shot so you didn't even fire those bullets that hit his head in your version, reason - Ubisofts server netcode, every round in every match is version of Han shot first but the server/Geroge Lucas jumps in and Han is now returning fire which results in him being dead, this also applys for enemies killing you when you are behind cover, happens alot  - hackers, 4 of 10 matches in CASUAL has hackers in it, Ubisoft outsourced anti-cheat to some lame company, and what we got isn't even anti-cheat, it is statistical analysis of player actions, kills, where he looks (if he is following players with aim through wall he has wallhack obviously), but this isn't working because hackers get boxes drawn around you and they just need to aim NEAR the box of the player and they can't be tracked for cheating, I played few matches in RANKED and every match had hackers so I stopped playing ranked, RANKED CHEATING goes so far that pro-players are CHEATING in STREAMS!! FFS! Even when everyone found out that one of the 'pro-team' were cheating Ubisoft let them play and they won F*****G PRIZE!  -glitching on table, in walls, like in not being able to move, happens a lot, happened to me at least 5 times, when you are near obstacle you press space and your operator jumps on/over it, in some cases you are stuck until killed, in some cases I killed enemy players who were stucked like that, in one case when I started to rappel from the roof down the wall from the outside of the building, I glitched and was now hanging from the ceiling INSIDE room full of enemy players and got F*****G REKT  -teamkilling, this game has frendly fire in order to prevent people storming in under machinegun fire to extract hostage, this is cool but game isn't punishing people fast enough for teamkills, only when he teamkills 2 of the players in short amount of time player gets autokicked, great, since teams are made of 5 players you are now playing 2v5 until the next round if any new players join whatsoever, vote option is opted out in match point (when who wins this round wins match), so you can't KICK teamkillers when it matters the most!  -chat options, you dont have chat history, everything that is written in chat will be gone when text fades after 5 seconds, seriously Ubisoft, and worst of all, now check this out, YOU CANT MUTE ENEMY PLAYERS! WTF! So when enemy players start spamming in chat, and since there is no chat history, YOU CANT READ WHAT THE F**K ARE YOUR TEAMMATES TRYING TO TELL YOU!!  All of this has to be fixed or this game has no future. You can't enjoy this game when at least one of this problems will happend in your current match. If this game stays like this I am predicting that in about 1 - 2 years servers will be shutdown and game will cease to exist because of 'lack of ineterst' and all of us who bought it will be left with invitation to new Ubisoft money grabbing game which will repeat same mistakes.",

            "review_text": "This is an outdated review, many things have changed (for the better and for the worse), I'll update the review to the latest patch eventually.  UPDATE for Patch 1.1:  The patch fixed minor issues. But not enough to compensate the patience invested to handle all the random issues within the game.  Biggest problems still are present in the game, the most important issues are: Netcode issues, random disconnections and random high ping spikes, there are many more, but these are the most annoying ones.   I'll put you an example. If you play with your friends 5v5 for 10 matches (casual or ranked) in a row. I can be so sure that at least 2 of your team or the oponnent team will suffer a random technical issue before the 5th match, eg: random disconnections or error, netcode issues, high ping spikes, etc.   Still feels like a Beta, get it for $30, is not worth $60 for what it offers.  If this was a Beta, it would be a solid Beta. If this was at $30, I would put down the standards a little bit. But, this is a game for $60, you must have good standards for a well known Franchise, for a $60 product, the consumer it is expecting a product that should work at 100%.   I will update the Review for the next Patch.   --------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------   Review for the Original build 1.0  I played the closed Beta and Open Beta, Ubisoft didn't bother to fix many things, and I don't know if they are working on the most of important issues (Netcode as an example).  Can't recommend because: 1.- Is not worth $60 (got it for $38 instead), wait for a good sale. 2.- Netcode issues, and this is the most important issue we all have. Competitive players will be so frustrated. Ubisoft shouldn't be bothering about e-sports when Rainbow Six Siege netcode is not good. It is worse when Battlefield 4 launched. 3.- I'm not surprised why the RS core fans are dissappointed, no Campaign.  4.- Lack of customization. 5.- Compare the RS SIege from E3 build to the current one, you''ll be even more frustrated. 6.- You might have issues with Uplay. 7.- Always Online 8.- There are reports with different kind of Rigs, from mid high to high end Rigs that have issues with the performance, including some SLI configurations. 9.- Only dedicated servers with Ranked matches 10.- There is a glitch where you can see which operator your team has before the match begins. And if you are playing casual, doesn't matter. But competitively, depending in the map AND objective it actually matters a bit. Minor bugs and glitches are consant, but it will get annoying later on, example:  -Drones sometimes just fall in the map. -Sometimes, you can get through the wall when rappelling (instead going up, down, left or right), so anyone can see you from the other side of the wall (and shooting you down). But it gets fixed automatically in a moment. -Joining a squad with your friends sometimes doesn't work properly, or you are in the squad already, but doesn't proceed with the matchmaking, you'll have to reboot the game to fix it. -It is very rare when it happens, but the sound in a match fades out, it can ruin the experience and you can lose a match because of it. In overall, It feels like a Beta.   Some opinions:  The Microtransactions and Skins are meh, doesn't matter how much money they put in. If you have a good team, you'll be fine. Skins are merely cosmetics in the weapons, doesn't improve your gameplay, only few you can get them with in game currency, but most of them only with real currency or money.  I recommend it because: Teamwork it is necessary for victory. Don't forget to configure the Mic for Push to Talk. If you like ''tactical camping'', you might like being the defender.  AI it is decent, but not that good. If you play for casual fun (not competitively), you might like the game. Sound design is good. The sound enviroment plays a huge role.    Ubisoft is working to fix some of these issues with a patch. I will update this Review after testing the new update.",

Although I am connected to the SEA Server which is showing as 67 Ping I am averaging around 110ms each game. Most of the time you don't see the enemy kill you until you watch the dreadful kill cam which shows the person 'Perfectly spraying/not even hitting you directly and getting a headshot.  I really hope they do fix the hit detection as it's a very important part of the game.  The game is playable but you will become frustrated with teammates abandoning the game/afkers and teamkillers alike.  I cannot recommend the game in this state. I find even Early Access games are better than this and I'm apalled that Ubisoft can call this a 'complete product'.  I have checked the forums and I'm glad to see that they at least noting the issues that players are advising of but all the responses are 'We are investigating'.  The game engine definitely needs more time and fixing.  Edit: Fixed up 'beta' testing section to reflect opinion.",

But no story or over-arching mission line. Weapons and equipment are locked to characters. Each character has A special ability, 2-4 types of primary, 1-2 types of pistols. and two pieces of equipment. They are weighted in scales of 1-3 and armored aswell 1-3. It ends up feeling more like a class system, than individual characters... Light, med, heavy, with a special ability. Doesn't remind me of the flexibility of your R6 team in previous titles.  Terrorist hunt AI is bad, they rush, flank or camp. Magnetic aim on realistic or intentional missing on lower difficulties. They have NO FACE! Worst of all there are men in biohazard suits, with extremely high health that walk around suicide bombing. Makes the game feel like a joke. Takes away from the realism and makes it even more arcadey.  After forwarding all the correct ports my NAT is OPEN. I always have 50 ping connecting to the ubisoft servers.

They will be closed completely on your screen. But during the kill cam there was a hole, and someone was sitting looking through it at you. Carefully aiming the whole time.  There are sound delays where an area will be breached, and the sound will be delayed by 3 seconds. By then you're already getting shot through the hole made. After almost a year of patches, still terrible networking.  Advertizments all over your home page. Microtransactions galore! You can have the most vibrant colored weapon of your team! Skins for your characters and guns have been added over and over, whoopie! They are overpriced for a grind. Some are exclusive and use 'R6 points' which are basically real money.  It feels like Counter Strike meets Battlefield/Call of Duty with the smallest dash of Rainbow 6. (You can lean while in any stance!) Next year is confirmed to have 4 more seasons, with characters and maps for free. But if the networking issues aren't fixed I won't even bother to play them.",

This same error seem to appear in the middle of a game and kicked me out of the game and squad. The game itself would be nice if it wasnt so buggy. In every game I've been in, it's one life and no respawn. the wait time is ridiculous. I cant even tab out of the window to do something else. It has to be in fullscreen. Definately not worth $60  EDIT: It's been about 6 - 7 months later. Review still stands. I thought someone on my team left, until in the middle of the game, all the sudden I drop, and permantly stuck on the main menu screen. woo hoo. Still buggy. Season pass is not bad though. That's a change. Still playing this game and still disappointed because of how much I love to play it until it gets all buggy.  EDIT: Still forced to play this game with some friends. It got better, a lot less glitches. But now the gameplay is changing for the worse. Now the electric drone is available upon starting the game. It's the only thing in the game that can attack at the start of the match. Wow that's just genius. Unbalanced is the new...balance. Still running into hackers, but not as many. People headshot and kill you the milisecond you come around the corner. Now you actually have something to spend renown on which you had too much of with the season pass. More attachments for your gun fantastic...whatever.  EDIT: This game is unplayable when you reach a higher level because it doesnt match skill level. With the new patch, there's still bugs where you basically have problems joining a game together in a squad including getting teammates kicked out of the game all the time. What could they possibly have changed that does this? They also put completely useless guns in the game as if there werent enough guns to exist. Too bad Activision didnt make this game. Ubisoft made this a disaster, yet this game is somehow popular. Can't imagine how they tricked people into thinking this game is actually a well made because it's not. Innovative, but poorly executed.",

I played it a lot before on my uplay. but quit it cause of cheaters and matchmacking. recently heard that they fixed problems with cheaters and also noticed sale on steam on gold edition (i didnt have season pass). so decided to give it a try once more and bought it on steam. and i noticed that cheaters are really not such a big problem anymore... plus new maps and new operatives are very cool.  But here come big cons: - uplay (it was bad before its bad still) - cheaters. not so many but still very annoying when you get them. - ping even more crucial now. - finding game can be a problem (maybe cause of there new anticheat. idk). 4 out of 5 times you will get error and have to restart matchmaking. and it can be really boring to matchamking for 10 minuts for game that will be 15 minuts. - if you dont have at list 3-4 friends than this game totaly unplayeble. because in matchmaking you will get 90% of time arranged teams (at list 2-3 players). and arranged team vs random almost win every time. - also everyone saying that any operator can be good or can be countered. but u will understand fast that some operatives are too OP.  but in the end all those cons can be forgiven. except two: matchmaking still broken if you dont have friends. but even if you have frineds matchmaking still broken cause will give you error 4 times out of 5.  PS so if you are a solo player (or your friendes paying not as much as you - thats my case) i dont reccomend this game to you. play better in payday or dirtybomb.",

Also, needs some menu adjustments and game mechanics tweaks.   **Update: The game has been out less than 3 weeks and is already on sale for $45. I will not be preordering anymore UbiSoft games from here on. I will wait until it hits its first sale... **As was predicted by many, there are too many hackers and tkers. You can barely go a match without someone killing you at the start for no reason. Vote kick? No, they do it when they have a group of 3 or more just to be stupid. Why isnt there a mechanism to auto kick someone who tks at the start of a match? Because UBISOFT.    They released this bold move of zero tolerance ban for cheating. The problem is they cant detect the cheaters. You can pay $21 a month for a hack that isnt detectable. I know people who I have reported and openly admit(evidence in t hunt), and still are on the game. What is worse is I am beginning to think that Ubisoft is selling the cheat. Consider this: You buy the game - $60. You buy the cheat $21 p/m. Ubisoft EVENTUALLY bans you. Then they came out with this $15 starter edition. You buy the game again. You buy the cheat again.

However, because of terrible matchmaking, you typically end up with massive gaps in skill level between players, rank 30s often end up with people over 125 in their games and therefore the massive learning curve becomes even harder to hurdle over. But that actually isn't even the main problem. The real issue is that more than 50% of the time you are stuck in queue for a match for over 2 minutes when the ETA is roughly 20 seconds and once you join a match, the odds of at least 2 players leaving mid match and never having the spots filled for 4+ rounds is about 85%. The matchmaking and queues are legitmately broken. I rarely ever back-fill a game when in queue even though it's blatantly obvious many games in progress are missing players and worse part is even if you do back-fill there is no bonus for doing so. Back-filling in the game is just aweful to begin with and then when it does happen you get an average of 50xp because the team you joined is still down one or two players or just blantantly out matched in terms of skill and usually rank. Another failure at the basic level for another wise good game from Ubisoft. This will be my last purchase of an Ubisoft product.",

The appeal to those games, and indeed the appeal of the entire franchise, was the tactical planning involved in the single player missions. The story that progressed from mission to mission, in both games, kept the player involved, and feeling as if they were unpeeling an onion-like storyline that kept getting deeper and deeper, as the missions got harder and harder.  This legacy is nowhere to be found in Rainbow 6 Siege. There is no tactical planning. There are no friendly AI 'operators' that you can command. No squads, no overview, no story, no plot. This is just another shooter game, made on the back of a once-great franchise, for the purpose of selling DLC by making unlockables that are so difficult to grind, people are more inclined to shell out a few bucks to just buy the in-game currency...  ... but for what? Why would you want to buy anything in-game? It doesn't help you advance through a compelling storyline, where the unlockable items might be required to complete any specific mission. It only helps you to use different (although not often 'better', as each operator is a 'YMMV' type of thing) equipment that's nifty to play with. (e.g.: Riot shields and mounted light machine guns)  Then there's the hacks. My second multiplayer match, I had a guy say 'watch these hax', and he proceeded to just run around and headshot all 5 of the opposing team without aiming.  And througout it all, I have yet to be able to participate in voice chat during multiplayer... a problem that is evidently very widespread, long-standing, and still unresolved.  I bought this game for $15 via Steam. Because of this, unlockable things are far more of a 'grind'. That's fine. I feel like I saved myself the additional $45... because those unlockable things aren't all that compelling or necessary anyway. At least I got to experience the game and know I made the right choice to not waste any MORE of my money on it.",

The biggest gameplay annoyance was the rfrequency at which one dies, resulting in you being out for the rest of the match, and if there's not more than one round, that can mean several minutes before being able to play again, and you can die very quickly. The ratio of menu time to game time is very bad.

The controls and feel of the game have compleatly changed to a more of a COD handling experience, with quicker movement of your operative and you can no longer lean against walls and blind fire like Vegas 2. But you can lean to look while aiming. The physics have changed and there is much less ragdoll. You can no longer customize your operative like in vegas 2 and there is no main storyline. so some of the leveling incentives are not as motivational and is less immersive. The AI can seem overpowered at times and proves it watching the kill replay camera on single situation missions. However the ammount of stragity has incressed amazingly and there is so much more you can do than Vegas 2. There is a lot of ephisis on teamwork now which is great. The AI has become very smart and you cant just go in shooting . If you are thinking this is going to be the next Vegas 2 and loved that game so much and was waiting for the better awesome verison your wrong and I dont recomend this game. But if you like all FPS games and are a COD (i hate by the way) fan and want a tatical twist on the game then this is your game. Overall Im very disipointed with what they have done with the series and the reason I liked Vegas 2 so much was for the uniqueness of it and the ability to customize your guy and loadout. now things are much more limited and have a more arcade feel than an actual simulation.",

            "review_text": "((Hours played: 3 hours)) This game could be the best game in the world, and I still couldn't give it more than a 5/10. Rainbow Six: Siege is a technical mess. I always say that most games shouldn't be released when they are because of the amount of technical issues they come with, but this game  really  should not have been released with the staggering amount of bugs, instability, network issues it has.  To date I have only played around 30 minutes of the actual game. I really want to play this game, because it seems fun. The game crashes all the time, you don't get XP when ubisofts servers are offline, I'm locked to the brazilian datacenter, nobody speaks english. Seriously, I could go on and on. From what little i've played the game, I like. But the amount of issues this game has is outrageous. So I cannot reccomend this to anyone just yet sadly. Wait for it to be patched. --------------------------------------------------------------- ((Hours played. 20 hours)) So I've had time to play this game and come back and update my review. Will I be giving this game a thumbs up? God no.  I actually like this game, I think its fun as hell. I've generally been loving this game in spite of its myriad of issues.  Heres a list of said issues: - You don't get alot of game for $80 cdn. I couldn't in good faith reccomend this game to anyone, its straight up overpriced for what you get. I could see my friends buying this at *maybe* $40. Lets be honest here, anyone who buys this game for $80 is an idiot. Myself included. - Stuck on the brazillian server with no way in hell of playing with anyone who speaks english.  - Stuck on the brazillian server (part2) Playing with 250-400 ping.  - Matchmaking sucks in general, and its particularly horrible in this game. - No dedicated servers. - Dozens and dozens of bugs that you can just google for yourself. - In terms of gameplay you should be able to see what classes your team is selecting, while you pick your class. They don't give you alot of time, so it sucks when your team has 3 shields or something. Also show the map on the class select screen.  - I wouldn't say there are overpowered classes, but there are definately classes that contribute almost nothing in terms of usefulness. IQ, Doc, Pulse. to name some.  In summary this is a good challenging tactical shooter that requires teamwork, that should not have been released in the state that it was, and is in no way worth $80. Don't do it. Don't reward this kind of ♥♥♥♥, its already too late for me.",

It would be one thing if we were paying $60 for a title that pushes the visual or technical envelope but this one does NOT. Seeing the few guns and tools that were unlockable did not entice me to keep playing nor did a Season Pass which probably will contain the missing elements to this game in the future. Will purchase the game again when the Season Pass and full game are around ~$30 because honestly this is a fun little mini-game, not the next counter-strike.

Their are numerous characters for each faction. However only a couple are really viable in any given map and you will be short changing yourself choosing someone else. Also , and im being serious here, only about 1/5 of your deaths will be because you were out played, out smarted, made a mistake or some other game related thing. 4/5 of your deaths will come from someone walking around a corner, killing you, and never even appearing on your screen. Then you get to watch what THEY saw, and compare it to what you saw. You will be confused, you will be enraged. On a side note, you only have to spend $192.72 to get all the horriblly rushed dlc that no one asked for. I mean why would they fix the servers or other game problems when they can put out a skin for only 1 character and charge $8. This game is not worth $50. It is not even worth the $25 when it is half off. You could pick a random game of steam in the same price range and most likely end up with a better game.

            "review_text": "It's been some time since my last review of this game, but here are my thoughts after a few more weeks of gameplay; This game is under-patched and over-hacked.   Patches are rare and news updates constantly revolve around new content, with no recognition of the absurd cheating running rampant in the community along with irritatingly horrible netcode and gargantuan hitboxes that they have claimed to fixed, but alas no changes.   The matchmaking system takes upward of 10 minutes to find a game, eventually pooling you with other people on the opposite side of the world and everyone sits and waits for half of the other team to leave before the game actually starts.   Just another game where matchmaking doesn't work and server hosting needs to be in the players hands, allowing devs to fine-tune the game. But here, you're paying money to play a game inevitably against a hacker who will grief you in competitive 'ranked' play and you will die over and over until you join another game with another hacker, only to relive the experience for who knows, up to 30 minutes of griefing? With no power to report or remove the player, you could just leave the game, but then you will be penalized and unable to play ranked for 10 minutes because, 'Shame on you for quitting.'   I can't recommend a game like this when so many others have achieved the same basic qualities of a standard FPS gameplay to a standard that is so much higher than this. I can't believe a company would think it's okay to release a game and not have patched obvious necessities within 2 weeks time of the last patch. I'm pretty sure people don't want to get their nuts stepped on for 2-4+ weeks by griefers while you write a giant service pack for a newly released game engine, but that's exactly what's happening. Similar situation with GTA5 and cheaters, but that game is much more fun.",

Pros: Extremely satisfying destruction and physics  Noises travel around rooms and bounce off walls(not through them)  The more pieces of crap there is on the ground the louder footsteps are.  Extremely tactical when you can find a functional team.  Cons: There are no good functional teams  Everyone quits after they die once  bunch of cod kids trying to be tactical(screwing over teammates)  Nearly everyone teamkills you if you don't instantly do the the job your operator was meant to do.  Matchmaking is terrible.  No one knows how to play the game.  Not enough loadout customization.  when someone kills you, sometimes it will look like you died for no reason and it gave the kill to a random person because there was no sound and your guy just has a heart attack on the floor while all your teammates look at you and go, 'Hey! He died there better stand on his body and hope I don't get shot!'  The new operators in the DLC are super expensive and overpowered.  SuperCons: Frost. The Super 90. This gun is so overpowered that you could shoot somebody from over 100 meters with it and it will do more damage then sticking an AA-12 up someones nose and honding down the trigger. The Super 90 is also an automatic basically, however fast your trigger finger is, the Super 90 matches it. (For those who don't know an AA-12 is a fully automatic shotgun that pulverizes anything in it's path)   Peekers Advantage- With this extremely overpowered game mechanic, anyone who peaks another person fast enough will not even be seen by the opponent. Whoever is being peeked on will simply look like he was shot through a wall.    Superpeekers- When someone peeks with a Super 90, you have 0% chance of living. To compare, you have a better chance of winning the lottery while getting attacked by a shark while getting hit by a meteor with advanced aliens that are also winning the lottery on that meteor. 0% chance, or for you technical people out there that I hate so much, 0.0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001% Don't.

Level design.... not to shabby however the maps really just suck the bomb place ment is really only ever in 2 different spots so its not hard to find them or guess. and they don't give the players the ability to place the hostages or bombs as they please. kill cam sucks half the time when the kill cam is going the killing shot isn't facing the target and it makes you wonder what in the hell. Connectivity issues. horrible for everyone. Ubisoft put Tom Clancy's name on this garbage.

The developers should add an upgraded version of 'recruit' that allows more customization.   Also where is the single player???? I have a hard time believing that this is a $60 game that only has some multiplayer. Seems like a ripoff. I get there are solo training missions, but that doesn't count.

I don't even consider this game an FPS, it's the least fun strategy game I've ever played and the only appeal was the shiny physics and breakable walls, which wore off shortly.",

Oh and ranked will soon be as casual as casual is, with grenade indicators and hit indicators, etc The devs ignore the players and just listen to newb-forum users who are too bad to play ranked as it is currently; hardcore.  Update 1.1 brought some better gameplay, shields actually work, you are finally where you see yourself on your own screen instead of 1 second behind on server-side. The issue of playing casual matches and joining an already in-progress or ending match still exists, there is a matchmaking filter but no option to chose for not joining already in-progress matches. For now I am still keeping my negative rating until I see some more progress with fixing their game that feels like it is still in beta. I can't wait to see how hard they ♥♥♥♥ ranked.  EDIT 1:  Ranked is just casual but with more rounds with the addition of killcams to 'stop people from blaming someone for hacking.' This game is being forced onto the ESL scene so hard that the devs are ignoring game-breaking bugs (like peeker's advantage, playermodel glitches, hitbox exploits, rubber-banding grenades, shield glitches) and continue to lie about updating the tickrate. At first they said they updated it but all they did was change the netcode of how guns work and think which after the most recent patch, you are unable to get a 1 headshot 1 kill if the enemy is moving or prone. They have yet to change the movement in the game from being 1 second behind client-side which can make a whole match if you know how to abuse it (peek a corner really fast while leaning and you have 0.5 seconds invisibility, enough time to hide again and then peek while spraying where you last saw someone which usually pays off because they never see you until it's too late.) I don't think this game is redeemable now but I will continue to play it because I am a miserable person who gets bored easily and this game is a fun game to kill time with as long as you don't take it seriously. Current cons: -Hitreq -Netcode -Shields dont protect your entire head hitbox -Each patch/update breaks something subtle like headshot hitbox or grenades realizing the server is delayed from client side and rubber band back into your face or into your teammates. -The devs -The community  Pros:  -Battlefield level of destruction but less destructive and more intricate",

(what do you mean, money hungry game developers?)  2) the in-game recoil&amp;spread ratio is kinda questionable. I mean, with a sniper you have more recoil than a submachine gun spray and praying 40 bullets in 3 seconds. #logic  3) then there is also the fact that you HAVE to install and use Uplay, which not only is a program which has loads of bugs, but also is a program which takes 75% of your processor and makes your other applications either crash or lagg super hard -could also be my own processor but idk about that so this is just my own experience, could be different for you guys-  no honestly, this game is just a ''milk your customer'' pay 2 win game. kinda like Payday 2.  so no, I would recommend you either buy CoD, The Division, or CS GO if you want a game that's not money milking as hard as this is.

(30/7/16 Australian Date)  *Sees Rainbow Six Siege is free to play during the weekend *Downloads and installs RSS *Goes to start game, and what do you know, Uplay is still a thing *Starts up game, watching the pretty cutscenes that noone actually watches *Whew, finally finished cutscenes, now to play the game *Two words that I dreaded to see appeared on my screen *Creating squad *Always creating squad, no matter how many times I reinstall  Now, enough of that, and on to the serious part. At the time of writing this review, this game has been out for more than 7 months, almost an entire year, and yet as soon as I install and start trying to play the game, it breaks on an infinite loading screen. Now, I know what you might be thinking, 'But reviewer, why don't you just try to mess around with your router settings to get it to work', and while that might generally be what you have to do, it isn't something you SHOULD have to do just to play a game that has been out for 7 MONTHS.   I'm sad to say this game has most definitely failed to live up to its potential, squandering it on who knows what. Rather than fixing gamebreaking bugs that have been in the game since release, Ubisoft has instead opted to release yet more content, making the game even more broken than before. I can safely say that this game is NOT RECOMMENDED!",

But that’s where it stops UBI is infamous and notorious for having great vision but suffers from myopic creativity and this title is some of the greatest evidence yet. In golf and Baseball, they say it’s not just about the swing, it has a lot to do with the follow through. *Hint Hint* UBI that goes for game developing as well. After months of frustration my limit has been reached. Snails show more concerted effort to get things done than UBI. Sloths, chained to Rosie O'Donnell, swimming in an Olympic sized pool full of molasses shows more earnest and vigor to get things moving than UBI. The game had so much potential to turn the FPS market upside-down than many games in the past 5 years. What they did however is release a broken game. Then proceeded to release fixes as and when they felt like it. Game breaking bugs and glitches reigned supreme. Then came the hackers. Then the 8-year-old team killers. All these things coupled with UBI's lack of enthusiasm in releasing a decent amount of content has driven game play to an all time, record setting, level of repetitiveness.  With only two modes of online gameplay and very few maps you are left feeling a little on the jilted side. So they pour out weapon skins, boosters and little trinkets to hang on your weapon yet the major issues that players actually want fixed are left. A game of this proportion should have way more content than what has been released to date and the gameplay bugs that have continued to plague the game and its community should be fixed within a few days of discovery not left to cause gameplay to suffer so bad as to make those dedicated players want to give up. Yes, there will always be hackers and players whom will take advantage of in game bugs but again that’s why UBI should be more on its toes than they are. Don’t wait 3 months to fix a game breaking glitch such as the dreaded Castle Reinforcement glitch that hung around for months or the pregame setup slaughter glitch that cause many of the honest players leaving the game. Modes like Pilot Escort and Team Survival, being staples of the original Rainbow series have been discarded like a cheap hooker on the curbs of Los Santos. Other ambient issues that the game lacks miserably of are things such as effectible lighting (Shooting the lights out), weather effects, reflective team damage (for those that enjoy Team Killing), hostable lobbies so as not to have to wait up to ten minutes to get into a match.  There’s more but I’m tired of typing….It’s broken, they don’t care, don’t buy it. I warned ya.",

I'm not sure why Siege got the praise it did. Maybe I missed the boat, playing it a year after release, but I hate it. The game is ugly and runs very poorly on a 780 GTX. The combat is meant to have a focus on environmental destruction, but it's chaotic and confusing. The inclusion of offensive/defensive characters seems to limit tactical options rather than explore them.  I only played this because it was on a free weekend. Ubisoft has a terrible track record of treating PC players like second class citizens and releasing half-finished games.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

It is in perfectly with the pace and pace of interactive media devices. It also is a very nice chair to sit back and listen to it as you sit on the chair and make everything is and you are ready to go. The sound are very nice (my fav soundh is and the Naval Alarm) it makes you fell like you are part of the wheelchair and gives immersion to people who want it. The wheelchair tanks and wheelchair sounds are all very painful.  Gnomeplay ------------ The gnomeplay is in and very introesting and is is very difuse from the unturned of Iron gnomes of the future. Don't away have they have with the boob what?, is a bad and a bad thing and also in good. The floorplan system is very to makes sure store fronts. (UK)combat good. At in seconly after the fact thought i would not it, but me is be cloned and he is and evil man who is like me but very good and makes sure it is and also in is and whoever tries to make the plan of what is known the your earth who is is helping the sun force. The satnav aspect of the car is doctor, but i wish you could do more with the broken legs navy when it comes to Sublegs and wheelchair Raiding.   Prawnduckshot and Industry -------------------------- The Prawnduckshot is changes as it adds alot of blocks like the creeper spawner and helps you build your mob grinder.xample Guns and to make sure your divisions have the edge in a triangle. You also have this for Tank Aircraft and Ships screen can also be used for making varients to improve the thing you are making.

Also in the middle of a ranked match, while we have round six when we were matched by 3 points, the game ofcourse crashes in the middle of gameplay to desktop. i have reached a point to believe that rainbow six siege is a very terribly set up game, although the idea of the gameplay is fun and addictive. but the developers could have done better in terms of testing the game for bugs and issues. laslty, the servers are pure awful, you wait for ever to get in ranked, which they said is gonna be better since the update, but ofcourse Ubisoft is good at words, as always. I did write a good review about this game a few months back, which was really good. but now my mind has changed alot about this game.

            "review_text": "I tried 3 free weekends since Beta. You might not want to hear it, but the game is unplayable due to one thing. Listen me out please.  Let´s start. The game looks beautiful inside buildings, with fantastic destruction and shaders. It looks awful outside with plastic grey shaders and mediocre textures. It´s average graphically at best. It´s based upon the anvil next engine which, if you remember the latest Assassins Creed, especially the older 'AC Unity' game, the games done with that engine will be horrible. It runs nice on an R9 290X or for 1440p an Fury X with and I7 4770 or Xeon E3 1230v3. All perfectly fine on ultra settings if you can accept 60 fps minimum which isn´t enoughon this game because of these reasons: each time when I had those specs and tried it, even a friend on GTX970, complained the game only got 90 FPS average. Why is that bad? It isn´t unless you want one thing with this engine. Smoth mouse input and mouse accuracy without input lag. That´s the first technical issue I have that makes it unplayable Unless you run it 1080p medium (which looks mediocre to awful) on an single core strong and gpu strong build, it will never satisfy your mouse control input. We as PC gamers know smooth, fast and accurate, none smoothing or acceleration induced gaming control inputs. which is important for multi and singleplayer no matter the genre, even indie adventures. Unless you run 120 fps or higher the input is felt incredibly intense and makes aiming feel like ♥♥♥♥. No acceleratrion in windows settings, no energy saving settings on system control. My mouse and OS are free of any hinderances, works perfect everywhere else. Aiming fells hard. It´s ♥♥♥♥ optimization wise. Even on console it´s an issue. My old PS4 was feeling the same issue but 4 times worse. This is basically non acceptable, aka extremely nauseasus to play with. NOT TOLERATABLE. I quit the game and never bought it ever. Broken gameplay by technical issue I thought. They fixed many performance issues and now I´m running low settings 170 fps on my Fury X, Xeon 3 1230v3 3,7 Ghz and it feels playable, Win 10 64 bit. Besides that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ optimization and ♥♥♥♥ engine that makes playing that game feel awkward and swampy non matter the plattform, the game itself is mediocre at best. The bot fights in terroristhunt are buggy. They shoot through walls sometimes and often shoot you aimbotwise before you appear, as if you can even see them. They are not fair. Playing against real players is easier and more fair, unless you step from realistic diffifulty, down to easy. Which makes it all too easy. Normal is normal but not challenging enough. Difficulty wise the game is not properly balanced in singleplayer modes. Multiplayer worked like ♥♥♥♥ until mid 2016 when they updated their matchmaking. Before that it was unplayable mouse and lobby wise. Only a few are online right now, but enough to play it online in a team. I can not recommend this game on any plattform. Xbox One, PS4 or PC. It´s just playing like ♥♥♥♥ due to input lag and engine. Even if it makes fun with it´s customization and so on, it plays barely smooth enough to call it even a shooter. I hate the controls of this game with passion for a reason and I don´t recommend you playing a game which has ♥♥♥♥ controls. Video games first rule of playing is: Make the controls great. If not, go home and learn how to make games.",

I'm not even going to rant about the matchmaking, because everybody knows how bad that is generally, but what pisses me off is there are far too many games publishers now who seem to be keen on outright scamming gamers and yes, I'm calling this a scam.  Here's what is now standard business practice for games publishers like ubisoft and EA and all the other craptastic games publishers.  Step 1: Hype up their 'game' with lots of highly scripted and suspicious looking 'gameplay' trailers  Step 2: Hire big name actors or well known public figures to talk about the game who have no ♥♥♥♥ing clue about the product to read it from a script or outright make up utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t about it that makes no sense to the actual game, for some reason this particularly irks me because it seems like they haven't even tried playing the game properly for five minutes  Step 3: Give pre-orders and a release date en masse to generate even more hype, offer up exclusive usually game breaking content for people who pre-order the game or alternatively, offer up something that has no ♥♥♥♥ing worth whatsoever ( Usually some sort of skin for a gun or outfit for a character ) and tack on £10 or so to the original base price  Step 4: Release the game, people play it only to discover that there is far less content than what was promised, outrage will soon follow so either go quiet and never respond to any emails hoping the outraged gamers will go away. Or issue a grovelling apology and talk about how they made mistakes and will try to fix it all.  Step 5: Ignore the gamers in either previous scenarios  Step 6: Start releasing DLC content that was prepared before games release and what the developers really worked on, usually the DLC can be most charitably described as what I call 'content unlockers' as the data is already there and they have the models prepared but they want to charge the price of a full independent game for you to unlock it. These DLC come with all sorts of new problems that didn't really exist in the days fo expansion packs ( Which are like 7 DLCs combined or even a nearly seperate game for those who don't remember or were too young ) things like maps which segregate online communities because the people who refuse to pay for them won't get to play them and as mentioned before offering up overpowered weaponry etc. which further break the game especially if it's in multiplayer.  Step 7: Profit  Step 8: Make absolutely no changes after several months, ignoring any complaints made by gamers and move onto the next game, then repeat the process all over again.   I admit, I am rather rage downvoting this because I was stupid enough to let the game go over the 7 hour game time limit for steam refunds however when you consider how much this game costs and how much it is supposed to be offering even without the technical issues it really is a damn rip off. Games publishers need to be stopped from doing this and I think as of now I will actively boycott games publishers like this who think they can just release games for this amount of money and then force people to buy DLCs at ridiculous prices if they want to get any new content.  Yes, the gameplay they have shown us isn't bad, the destruction is actually quite good, however as an overall game, I am not impressed by it, I suggest everyone should go and buy this other little mentioned game called 'Due Process' when it opens up for early access. It is being developed by indie developers and is a much more reasonable price and has pretty much the same type of distruction minus the fractal door stuff but for the price of rainbow six siege you can get about 3 copies for you and your friends.",

Pros:       Mediocre Weapons Play    Potato Graphics (from what they showed at E3)    Decent Community (But most are stupid or cancerous)     Cons:      The match making is trash (still is) (Ranked: My team, all silvers except 1 gold 1; Enemy Team: All golds and a platinum)    The wait time is   ridiculous       No consequences for team killers (far too lenient)    Lighting looking from inside to outside is absolute trash, it's like peering into the f*cking sun!    Enemies being able to run outside all willy nilly and use it as a trashy, no skill, tactic. (needs to implement instakill for being outside for 2 seconds, similar to terrorist hunt) (Peaking is almost impossible to counter as lighting is trash, and holy heck, don't get me started on the cheap smg-11 w/ an acog, simply too overpowered.     Explaination   Overall, an okay game as long as everyone communicates and plays together. I would recommend if ubisoft fixs the smg-11 and problem with peakers.    TLDR:   Sh*t game, don't bother, everyone is cheap and plays dirty and talks tough.   3/10 Game  &lt;edit&gt; The matchmaking is better as the wait time isn't as long but sometimes the match making just sucks.

I have done everything to get past this. I have bought a new router. I have forwarded ever port under the sun. I have enabled/disabled UPnP. I have sacrificed baby goats to the gods of every religion up until that of the flying Spagetti Monster. Yet nothing works. I have spent hours foraging around forums for a fix like a junkie through a dropped baggie in a dodgy pub toilet. Nothing works. I have contacted Ubisoft to help me, only to be told to look though a forum ive already trawled through.   Great game, f.ucking terrible connection issues. Fix these issues, and you've of had a 5 star rating from me. I havent played this game since the Black Ice release due to not being able to connect. Good job Ubisoft.",
