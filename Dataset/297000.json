            "review_text": "I am old. My first PC game purchase ever was Heroes of Might and Magic III. A Windows 95 CD-Rom with an instruction book on real paper and my PC was not even met the requirements. It was an amazing experience. Little figures on a map searching for treasures and fighting monsters was something I only knew from table top games and now happened live on my 14' CRT screen. A whole world opened for me and since then I was really addicted to the Fantasy Turn Based Strategy genre. Later played the Warlords series, the Age of Wonders series and the Disciples series.  Almost 20 years later I still have Homm3 installed on my PC and now and then I even met people with the same experience from this game and we play hotseat together a whole night. I still own the original homm3 box, the Shadows of Magic boxed edition, the Collector's edition and the GOG version and when I don't have one available when I'm somewhere else I pirate it for a moment. I guess that's legal because I own the game in four different versions.  All this years so many progress is made by the real fans of this series to make the 20 year old title even better. We have VCMI, HD mod, Hota and so much user created content now that it is almost impossible to make a new edtion better then what is available fromt the community.  Maybe the biggest reason for me to play this game all this years without getting bored is that every map I play is different and unpredictable. This is because a generator creating a different map every play. IMO a must for every strategy/RPG/Adventure game on the market. I do not like scripted games, predictable games or story campaigns so much because after playing it one time I lost my interest to play the same map again. Also it keeps multiplayer fair because this way the map cannot be learned by players so nobody have advantage of knowing a map better then you.  Now imagine the best book you ever read and imagine a cheap B movie producer turns your book into a bad movie. That is exactly what happened with this version of Homm3 for me. The menu's of the game did not have any overhaul and are not fit in my laptop screen resolution anymore while the original 20 year old game does. For every click I make in the menu I have to wait at least two seconds while in the original game I misclick because the interface is so fast. I don't see any progress in interface or menu artwork and it's so much slower then the original. I don't understand this.  All content after the original game came out like the expansions, the user created content, the new factions, the thousands of maps/campaigns and even the RMG (random map generator) is not there. It's just the base game and even the base game on GOG have more content because it's at least updated with bugfixes afterwards.  The unique selling point from Dotemu is the graphics overhaul and Í have to admit that it is very nice to see that someone spend so many hours creating better looking monsters and heroes for my favorite game of all time. The units are cleaner and less pixelated on higher resolutions now and that is not bad. But they do not try something original or different so it's not amazing or surprisingly good. Just ok. In the town screens and on the map I cannot see any difference with the original and because every click is so much slower then the original game for me it's not worth the graphic overhaul.  I bought the game just to support the graphic artist and to have a voice on Steam to write my review.  I don't like the remake of my favorite game is not the perfect remake I can imagine. A remake IMO can never be a downgrade of the original. If you don't have original code from expansions you have to wait more time to release while hiring people from the community to make the perfect game or just don't touch it. It looks like a quick project to make cashflow for the company instead of a soul project led by people dedicated to the Homm series. That's something bad.   ",

Sadly i would not recommend this product to anyone, just look for the original 'Heroes 3 Complete' (they use the complete picture for one of the adds kind of false advertising if you ask me) and buy that instead. I would absolutely ammend this review in a more positive light if they add the expansions in a patch but for now it's not worth it unless you get it for less than $2.",

Heroes - limited from the original one, enemies - same problem, will take me too long to tell how many Ubisoft did not include from the original game.  Gameplay: I have that issue of enemies spawning in quite vast numbers randomly on the map. That leads to my heroes blocked out by hords of griffons(or any other creatures) which are preventing me from getting to key locations. There is still no random map option(where computer generates new map completely different to others, in case you have completed all the maps, which I have done in the past).  Very lazy, can't say graphics('HD EDITION') make it different from the original version. Do not recomend, the only reason I bough it is because I love this tittle.

Specially considering that it only the base game (its 2 expansions notwitstanding)  Only thing that is in true Widescreen resolutions is the main map, every other screen is in 4:3 with borders which is offsetting. And while the textures have been beautifully brought to HD, they are just redraws of the spritesheets, so they still have the same limited animations they had decades ago. The main menu is a great example of this (the angel's sword looks really rushed) They have recycled the cutscenes (which is the aspect of the game that has aged the worst, and they seriously needed a remake) which brings down the value of HD Edition.  Personally, Im dont like when games are graphics &gt; gameplay; but isn't the goals of HD Editions like this one to bring the graphics up-to-date to an already existing gameplay? (and a great one at that) I usually expect more when decisions like just remastering the base game are taken into account.

Go to  gog.com  and buy original game with expansions and download HD mod if you want to. The game itself is gold and I really appreciate the detail that has been done for the textures.",

Heroes 3 is seen by many of us fans as the best in series with a huge number of scenarios, campaigns and the ability to create and add more.  The game itself is a good strong RTS where you build your bases, build your creature armies and develop your heroes. The real winning thing about the game for me was always the ability to win scenarios in several ways. Set in a solidly created fantasy setting, the writing and world building benefits from the years of writing in all the previous Might and Magic and Heroes games. Sadly, Heroes 4 onwards ignored all this previous world building with Ubisoft's psychotic need to make their own mark on a franchise. What it resulted in was pathetically poor writing and betrayal of fans.  I'd recommend that anyone try Heroes 3, it's a truly awesome game.  That said I CANNOT recommend this edition. Aside from it being a stripped down version of the full game, this edition is WAY too expensive. The HD video is not enough of an upgrade to justify fewer campaigns and scenarios or the higher price tag. Worse still, they've built in the ability to revert to the SD video/graphics. The problem is that the SD video is not representative of the original game. It looks like it's been designed simply to make people avoid just recommending or picking up the original game on GOG. It doesn't work though.  If you want to try Heroes 3, and I highly recommend you do, go and buy it from another vendor. I'd suggest GOG. If you're a diehard steam fan though, perhaps we should all be asking Steam why they couldn't bring the originals to their store just like GOG have.",

The graphical retouching is of excellent quality, I have absolutely nothing bad to say about it.  Yet, this HD-remake let me down. I was dumbfound when I realized that the expansions, and their features along with them, were not included in this remake. The scenarios provided by the game are enjoyable, but this HD-remake doesn't have the amazing replay value that the original game has, due to not having the ability to generate and play random maps - the mainstay multiplayer fun of the title, in my opinion.  I have really mixed feelings about my purchase, after owning the HoM&amp;M III Complete, as it feels very different without all the added content in the expansions. I will be 100% happy with this HD-remake after the expansions become available, and I really do hope they are being worked on.

Now, the HD mod that many praises only gives you a zoom out on the whole screen to support higher resolutions and that's it. No changes to textures/sprites/bitmaps. So it's hardly the same thing.  This HD edition is based on vanilla Heroes III that has only one campaign, Restoration of Erathia. Also, Random Map Generator was added in Armageddon's Blade, along with other additions like Conflux town, more artifacts, etc.   I have GoG Complete version, even big box Heroes Complete Collection and I bought this too. It's a nice feeling to play the game that gave me so much wonderful memories. I've played the demo of this game for weeks even tho it was only one map with limited time.  The only bad thing is that the chances are very slim for an HD edition for AB and SoD and maybe the price.   This is the same game that many of us played back in '99 so don't hate it because Ubisoft is involved.",

I have both versions and this one has far superior graphics.  What the unofficial hd patch does is blow the map portion up to 1920x1080 so it fills your screen. It doesn't increase the resolution of any of the assets, and probably most irritating to me, it doesn't rescale the UI to match the larger resolution. So yeah, you see a huge area of map all shrunk down, but all the icons and creatures and towns are tiny! I actually had to downsize my res to like 1400 something just so I could read the text without squinting.  The HD remake here on steam is a ton better. It displays in 1920x1080 but it keeps the correct scaling of UI and creatures. And they look really nice, they have been touched up for this edition.  So all these people complaining about price, really you get what you pay for sometimes, or wait for a sale. I got my copy of a humble bundle. Although I do understand missing the expansions, that could be a deal breaker. But just want to put to rest the idea that the hd patch is equal to this remake- it's not at all. This version is comfortable to play and definitely doesn't feel like a 15 year old game.",

The only complaint I have so far is that the bottom resource bar looks really goofy with all the extra room on the left now. Not sure what the best way to go about fixing this would be though, maybe some extra info like income and daily resource intake or some stats like creatures raised/killed, or something like that.",

The Erathia base game is pretty much the same as the Complete eddition, aside from small few things. The most important things missing are: unit hotkeys (most people won't notice), artifact combination (happens rarely anyway), 1 town (the worst one at that, but beautfull), random map generator (not for long, as someone is making one), a few other heroes, and a few units), and obviously the campaign, but that's not why you're getting this game anyway. The multiplayer works well, but you do need to go to Firewall and add exception rule for 3 ports (given in the manual of the game that you can find on steam). Overall, the product is an 8/10. PRO: -Most of the stuff works well, the game has slight lag but you probably won't notice it. -MULTIPLAYER :D -Price is alright CON: -They could have just made the campaign withing a month or 2 tops... (this might come if the game sells well though) -slight lag, and slight things missing compared to complete eddition is a slight pain point -MULTIPLAYER: No ladder??? Also, 8 people can join a 4 player game, and the game doesn't always load on first or even 2nd try... Given that I run powerful rig with fast internet, next to the servers, i shouldn't be experiencing problems, hence we can tell that the problems stem from the poor software or servers (probably software..., duh...) -No replay function, nothing new what so ever.... THe graphics look slightly improved, but I'd rather see stable multiplayer and a rehall of the game without changing any of the gameplay features... DESCISION: Buy if you enjoy multiplayer with random people. DO NOT buy if you're expecting it to be perfect or if you're not a fan of HoMM 3 series because this is not a good representation of the potential that this game carries.",
