            "review_text": "An interesting little game and a nice way to while away an hour or so. Puzzle games are fun and they can be played in short little bursts. The game play still requires a bit of work (swinging, etc) but the humour is there and that makes up for it; for now. Hoping to see a bit more work and an even more polished product soon.",

            "review_text": "I tried to like this game , I really did. But i cannot recommend it.  At its core it is a platformer with push puzzles , traps and physics. Problem is , the difficulty stems not from the game design but rather from the lack of it. Some puzzles require you to jump on chains but the chains move without logic , sometimes catapultig you randomly around the room , into spikes. There are purple mushrooms that act like springs , but they seem to ignore gravity and intertia and just catapult you as they will into spikes. The final straw was a room of cannon enemies , their shots bounce like a pool ball , completely unpredictable , and explode on top of that.  I've had the broken mechanics work in my favor at times when i tried to push a treasure chest up a lift to distract some knights , it got stuck , bounced off a wall and crushed both of them. Another time a cannonball took out three enemies for no reason , they all just bounced into one another and died without taking any fall damage.  If you can forgive frustrating mechanics the concept is unique enough to check out , but right now , as far as I am concerned , the challenge is not designed as much as a chaotic physics engine that doesn't know whether it's coming or going.",
