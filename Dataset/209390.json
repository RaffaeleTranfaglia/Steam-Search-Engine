            "review_text": "I am of the rare breed that prefers Dungeonbowl to Blood Bowl; after extensively playing and enjoying the tabletop game, I waited for this game to be on sale. Purchasing it I was initially impressed with the game play but frustrated with the difficulties in finding an opponent. I made teams to match my tabletop ones which won consistently but here this was not the case. I pressed on assuming that I did not have the skill and it took me time to get used to the interface. I eventually realized that my gameplay had little to do with it: the rules were subtlety different and at times broken, such as game duration limit and no blitzing off a teleport. The final blow for me was the Dwarven Deathroller which in my opinion is so broken that I have caught myself swearing at my monitor at least forty times. All other 'big guys' have a detriment skill like take root, really dumb, etc. but not this beast. I calculated that teams I played against that did not have a Deathroller, I won &gt;65% of games while if they did have one, I would win less than 20% of the time.   Why not make a team with a Deathroller, Trou? My answer: why not make a game that is at least reasonably balanced?  I am able to look passed a lot of this game's flaws that are stated here in these accurate reviews but combined together with this diarrhea on top, I would not recommend this game even if you love the table top version like I do.   Jepumk said it best: it is a poorly realized version of the table top game.",
