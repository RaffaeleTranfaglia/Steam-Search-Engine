            "review_text": "Honored Members of the Steam Customer list, My name is unimportant, but I am here to dispense the rational defense that this game has deserved. As you all have seen in recent reviews, it has been berated for being half complete, or ending after the 3rd act. Yet after 3.5 hours (I am a vet. of Pheonix Wright) we can come to the conclusion that it is absolutely a blast to play. The humor is witty, and quick. The art is stupendous, the story maybe not as complicated, but these people need to hit their stride, and they can do something great with this. Maybe not 10 games worth, but maybe a sequel or something better. Anyway, the music is great, the characters are charming. Is it buggy? Maybe a bit, but nothing so outrageous that this game cannot outweigh its pros, and enjoyment. People will talk about a horrid, or unfinished ending, but this game ends on a note that makes you want more. With evidence of completing the game after 4 acts, the best ending I have reached in a game since Fallout New: Vegas, I believe we have a bit of a gem on our hands, and that you should not waste this opportunity. The ending is not unfinished, it has more than 1, it is overly original, and I believe it is worthy of its price. The defence rests its case.",

The country has received ceveral political turnovers in the recent decades, made a swing from republic back into the Ancient Regime and is currently in the final stages of Louis Philippe's reign.  The system in Paris is corrupted as we know and love it, filled with strong characters prone to dramatic acts and speeches. The humour I found particularly good. The whole theme of justice as a moral feeling and a social necessity is played out very well. The only negative point I could think of is that it is not particularly hard to figure things out.",

            "review_text": "Sparrowson and Jayjay Falcon, the eponymous aviary attorneys, live in a version of 19th Century Paris populated by animals. The gameplay very much resembles Ace Attorney‘s, with the player taking control of the game’s protagonists to investigate crime scenes, interview witnesses, and gather evidence as they work their way through the duo’s cases. While the core mechanics remain the same throughout the game’s story, the overarching narrative will take you beyond the courtroom and into the bowels of Paris where revolution is brewing.  The game’s visual style and sound are both fantastic, uniquely making use of actual artistic works from the period now available in the public domain. For those who have played Aviary Attorney, an image search of artist J. J. Grandville’s name will show a lot of familiar characters who have been faithfully represented within the game. The use of composer Camille Saint-Saëns’s works adds a congruity to the game’s sonic identity that greatly enhances the experience.  Solving the cases is mentally stimulating, and there are a few different endings for each case depending on the choices you make as you progress. The game’s plot is intriguing and features a satisfying amount of twists and turns that pulls you into the story. And of course, the game is just really damn funny. If you like terrible bird puns, I’d highly recommend giving Aviary Attorney a look.",

            "review_text": "Taken by itself, this game is alright. Stick with me, there's more to this, or this would be a thumbs-up.   There's a good narrative, but the gameplay suffers for it. The gameplay is immaterial for the first half of the game; while it's true that winning or losing a trial affects the game, it's a cosmetic difference in the end. Nothing actually changes, you're not locked into or out of any ending. There's a lot of promise here, with the time passing mechanic, the ability to miss evidence and lose lose trials and continue, and having a jury to convince, but the game shifts narrative gears after two cases and that opportunity is squandered.  My other big complaint is that the game deliberately attempts to evoke Ace Attorney, and does a poor job in practice. The gameplay is incredibly shallow; you never have more than a couple handfuls of evidence, and the contradictions should be incredibly easy to spot for any veteran of the series. The most likely thing to trip you up is the time mechanic. It's also short. I've got 4.4 hours on record; that's how long it takes to beat the game and get every ending.  Truth be told, this would probably be better without what feels like a token amount of gameplay. The narrative is interesting, and if you're looking for a good short story you could do worse. However, you will likely leave very disappointed if you're looking for gameplay of Ace Attorney caliber, as I was, which is why this is getting a negative review.",

            "review_text": "A very charming take on the Ace Attorney-style gameplay. With a refreshing, underused setting of 19-th century France, beautiful artwork by J. J. Grandsville, and a musical score that ranges from whimsicall to outright epic, Aviary Attorney turns into an experience thatI had no idea that I had wanted previously.   For those who aren't familiar with the Ace Attorney-style detective games, here's a brief introduction: The main characters ar edefense atorneys, who have a new case brought upon them with each chapter. In the alloted days leading up to the trial, they must travel about the city in search of evidence so that their defendant may walk free from impending incarceration. The unique gameplay element that Aviary Attorney introduces is the ability to fail a case and have the story progress in spite of it. Because of this, the game allows you to re-load any given day within a chapter so the player may make new decisions and achieve a different outcome. This is really handy, considering that there are several subplots that can develop differently over the course of the first three chapters.  One of my favorite additions this game brings to the genre is its sense of scale. Aviary Attorney takes place in a society on the cusp of revolution. The meta-narrative of the game is presented not only in some of the major cases, but also in optional cutscenes that not only flesh out the world, but do so in a manner that helps present the story in a manner akin to a noir television serial. Within the three possible endings you can achieve, it's very interesting to see how our characters will eveolve along with the plot. There's welcome character growth within each route that builds on previous cases in a different way. It's definitely one of the best introductions of consequence in a murder-mystery game.  This game is definitely worth it's price if you're itching for a new murder mystery series to explore.With the added ability to fail a given trial and have the story go on despite it, the game's ability to re-load any individual day of a case allows for an unexpected ammount of replayability. Fans of mystery novels, the French revolutionary period, and witty humor should definitely crack this one open!",

The visuals are stunning, and very well implemented from the original source material, the score is excellently chosen (who doesn't love Saint-Saens?), the scripting is witty, and the storyline gripping.  The interface is very simple to use, and the evidence-finding and trial systems require thought and reasoning - it's most certainly not a sure thing that you'll be successful!  The only thing I have found (and I had to think hard) that is mildly irritating is that if you do badly and want to go back to a previous day's save, there is no way to speed past all the dialogue you've already done that day to get to the bit you want (this can take quite a lot of clicking). I believe, however, that they are in the process of implementing a fix for this by improving the saving points.  Also, thinking about it, I have finished it in two evenings - although this could well just be because I couldn't put it down! You can replay the later chapters for a couple of different ending options, should you so wish.  I thoroughly recommend this game - it would not be a stretch to say that this has been the best money I have spent on Steam this year!",

The ways in which the different outcomes are achieved and the dialogue systems were well thought out. The storylines that were finished that is... sadly when you achieve one of the main story branches it states that the path is not yet finished and you have to step back a few days and try a different course of action. Not a good selling point for a supposedly non-early access game. That aside the game achieves what it sets out to do, create an Avian parody of Ace attorney. Mechanically the game works great. You travel around Paris in order to collect evidence and defend your client. There are several different locations you can travel to but traveling to most locations takes a whole day and you only have a certain amount of days before you must appear in court. This puts contraints on what you can do which makes matters seem more pressing. Avian Attorney really pushes you to actually investigate rather than blow money gambling on black jack (which is totally an option). the nice thing is if you missed a crucial piece of evidence you can always step back a day to get the ending you want. as I mentioned above the dialogue is also well written. There are so many different approaches you can take to obtain different forms of evidence or get past obstacles. will you bribe them or persuade them or just threaten to beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of them? the shear variety of choice within what is a relatively short storyline is the main draw for this game, well.. that and the glorious amount of Bird puns. all-in-all I give the game an 8/10 purely for being unfinished and me wanting even more of it! Although seemingly a simple novelty game at first sight Avian Attorney proves itself to be a fun and interesting ride for those who enjoy investigative games.

Though this seems like a lot of content, I was able to go through the game in approximately 8 hours at a leisurely pace. I have no doubts someone could get through this game in 5 or less hours.   I will say this game has great music, art, and dialogue. You can definitely feel the love and effort that was given to these areas of the game and I loved it. It truly felt refreshing.   The story however is short and, in my opinion, a little lacking. All of the cases are quick and have rather simple scenerios. Especially Case 4, where investigation is streamlined and we are given short and simple endings. Case 3 probably took the longest but only because you have to go through it fully twice to get both the endings.   Now, at it's modest price tag of 15$ (compared to Ace Attorney's 35$ on release) you get a comperable amount of time for your dollar. However, don't be expecting long/intricate cases or a thrilling plot. But do prepare to chuckle whenever Sparrowson speaks.  ",

            "review_text": "Note: This review was orginally negative before being changed to positive as a result of the 1.02 patch. I have saved the original review down below for future reference. ----------------------------------------------------------------  Let's get the obvious out of the way: Aviary Attorney is clearly inspired by Ace Attorney. Everything from the gameplay, the type of humor, the dialogue and courtroom sessions are incredibly similar to the Capcom classic. Hell, the initials of the two series are the same and I doubt that due to coincidence.   If you like Ace Attorney, I'll cut straight to the chase and say it: You'll probably like Aviary Attorney as well and it’s worth your money.  To go into detail, the game functions very similarly to Ace Attorney. You get a client coming in to defend them from a crime, usually murder. Then you have several days to wander to different areas of Paris, interview witnesses, gather clues and generally stick your beak where it don't belong. At the end of that period, you have a trial where you cross examine witnesses, present evidence and find contradictions.  So far, so Ace Attorney, right? The similarities go deeper: The main character is a bumbling and struggling defense attorney with a puntastic assistant. The prosecutor for the first case is inept before being replaced by your hoity toity high class rival who delights in insulting your skill. Many characters debate the true meaning of 'Justice'...etc. etc.  So what sets it apart? Why buy it when Ace Attorney 6 is announced.  Well for one, there's no guarantee that Ace Attorney 6 will ever make it out west with the latest title in the series, The Great Ace Attorney, unlikely to ever release here so.....you don't have much of a choice.  But yes, there are some changes from the Capcom series that sets this title apart.  The most obvious is the art style. Aviary Attorney's most well known feature is that all the characters are anthropomorphic animals taken directly from the works of the 19th century French Caricaturist J.J Grandville. The art has been touched up in places, mostly to add animations such as blinking eyes and beaks/snouts/muzzles moving. They're not extensive by any means but are done quite seamlessly with a minimum amount of 'original' artwork to fill in the blanks. (For example, one character pulls out a gun and a sharp eye can see that the outstretched arm's cross hatching isn't quite as detailed as the original art, indicating it’s a new change for the sake of the animation).  Some people might be turned off by the black and white visuals but I greatly enjoyed them as they gave a real picture book feel to the game and it’s always nice to see a game that increases the appreciation for classic art.  This extends to the music in the game which is also lifted mostly from 19th Century French composers of the Romantic era such as Hector Berlioz and Camille Saint-Saëns (as well as some original tracks made by the game's composer) which sounds absolutely beautiful.  When compared to Ace Attorney, the graphics in Capcom's offering are definitely better (though I like the style of Aviary's more) but the musical tracks are a no contest to Aviary Attorney, as much as I like the music in Ace.  This all fits in perfectly with the time setting of the game: 1848 Paris. If you know your history, you'll know that 1848 is a pivotal year for France and you will get embroiled in France's real life history one way or the other. (Err....but with some liberties taken of course. It's a game about anthropomorphic animals after all).    But how is the gameplay? I won't lie; the investigating and interviewing processes in Aviary Attorney are pretty simple. Especially when compared to the multiple games in which Ace Attorney has had to grow out its staple of gameplay mechanics (i.e., adding in forensics, multiple angles to a crime scene.....etc.). Due to being limited by using J.J Grandville's art, the creators couldn't create incredibly complex locations for the game's crimes and therefore, all the cases seem rather simple when compared to the genius of Shu Takumi's crime drama writing. Aviary Attorney has the very simple mechanic of simply talking to witnesses and clicking on various objects in the background to reveal items and even the latter is only in special locations designated for investigating.  Overall, the game's cases are simpler and shorter than that of Ace Attorney. Still intriguing and interesting but not as good.  But Aviary Attorney has an ace up its sleeve, time and branching pathways. In Ace Attorney, it’s not possible to advance unless you have all the evidence you need to win the upcoming trial. You can keep switching around the various locations available to you till you find that one person or one event that will propel the story forward.  In Aviary Attorney, when the game tells you 'The trial will commence in three days' You're on the ♥♥♥♥ing clock. Visiting most locations will consume an entire day and if you overlook a piece of evidence or go to the wrong locations, you can very well end up in court short of the evidence you need to clear your client. This is most evident in Case #3 which can end up in three different case #4s depending on how well you utilized your time and dug for evidence. It is entirely possible to go to the wrong locations and ♥♥♥♥ up the trial. Another possibility is you get a partial success. In case #2, you can clear your client but still not expose the real criminal, giving you partial success and access to case #3 regardless.   On top of all this, you have a money system in the game. The main character (J.J Falcon) has a wallet to carry his francs in which he can spend on various items in the game. You can usually get around paying by bringing another item or by clever dialogue choices but the currency mechanic means you can just skip some of the tasks in the game if you wish (As J.J Falcon says when asked for money or food in exchange for an item 'I'm done with this fetch quest nonsense, just take the damn money').  Overall, Aviary Attorney isn't as good as Ace Attorney but does a lot of stuff that Capcom should really look at and implement into their series to break it from its linear structure. The writing Besides, Aviary Attorney is 15$ while Ace Attorney games are over double that so the shorter game time is justified by the discounted price.  As of the time of writing though, some bugs in the game remain. The steam overlay still does not work (A 'bug' EA and Ubisoft will no doubt love to have), Saving is still not working (Saving and quitting sends you back to the last checkpoint, the beginning of the day) and achievements are still not implemented.  The devs have promised to fix these in addition to announcing a bonus chapter and a Linux version. So you might want to hold onto your francs if you these things bother you.  See you in court, monsieurs!  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Original Review Posted: 30th December Patch:1.01 Rating: Negative  This will revert to a positive review once the issues are resolved.  Aviary Attorney is an excellent, funny game with a unique aesthetic and as a detective/laywer game, it gives Ace Attorney a run for its money.  But at the moment, I can't recommend it. The game is incomplete.  One of the three endings is not implemented at all (It simply leads to a 'sorry! We're not finished with this branch yet!' message)  Quick save was removed in a patch due to buginess so you have to use the in game checkpoints.  There's no log for the dialog spoken so be careful of errant clicks.  Steam overlay bizarelly does not work with the game so I can't take screenshots from Steam itself.  If the game was labelled early access, I would have given it a pass but at the moment it's marketed as version 1.01. A full title.  Hopefully, the devs will live up to their promise of an update in the very near future.",

It's not just a rip-off, though. I liked how it's possible to miss evidence and fail trials, and wind up with different endings. It adds more realism and replay value, compared to Ace Attorney where you're forced to follow the correct path or it's game over. It was also refreshing that it included the ability to find someone 'not guilty' without necessarily having to prove that someone else did it. Which is the way the law actually works, at least that I'm aware of. The art and music are beautiful. I love the way the characters are animated, and the huge variety of animals involved. Also: stepladder jokes.",

If you have any love for Phoenix Wright-style games, you owe it to yourself to give this a try. Difficulty is a bit low, but then I never liked having to fish for the one connecting piece of evidence that the devs thought of (I'm looking at you, Ace Attourney). Also, since we're in France, there's an actual jury! Most of the time.",

I've only finished the first two cases as of yet (there are 4 total), but that's more than enough to recommend this game. It bears many similarities to the popular Capcom series. The gameplay is almost identical. In the field you collect evidence and interview persons of intrest and then you try to prove your clients innocence in court by cross-examinating the witnesses and finding contradictions in their testimony. Fans of Ace Attorney will also find few familiar tropes within the characters, but other than that the game very much stands on it's own. Its unique asthetics, characters and humor are mixed with a story set in the dawn of the French Revolution and makes for a very compelling narrative.  Few shortcomings: The music (although very good on it's own and definitely fits the setting) doesn't quite pack the same punch as the Ace Attorney soundtrack. Also the cases (at least the first two) are nowhere near as complex. They're pretty straight-forward and the twists and turns are not very suprising although still very well written.  PS. I've encoutnered a few bugs. Mostly the game locking up on a screen and not letting you progress, but it's just a minor annoyance since the game allows you to replay individual days rather than whole cases.",

In this game, you can miss evidence, as well as fail trials (and keep playing). Which makes this game all the more worthwhile. Your actions will have weight to them.  I do have something to say to the devs, though. For f***'s sake devs, change the game to Early Access.  I also have something to say to people who obtained the unfinished route and downvoted because they couldn't finish the game.   You guys are terrible lawyers.  ",

It has a decidedly different feel from Phoenix Wright; it's both darker and sweeter, in some ways. There's a bit more pressure on the logic of investigation than in other attorney games I've played, which makes gameplay feel a bit different, too. Although it's a short game, it's definitely worth the money, and I look forward to more games from this team!",

AA is a visual novel with court-scene puzzle sections, where you have to present your case by choosing the right evidence in order to win the jury’s favour. What I love about this game is it strikes the perfect balance between serious and silly. Yes, the characters are all anthropomorphic animals (a lion smoking a pipe anyone?), and puns are lavished throughout courtesy of Sparrowson, (usually accompanied by a world-weary sigh from Monsieur Jayjay Falcon).   But the dialogue is well-written, and the characters and crimes are ones you end up genuinely caring about. The deeper you get, the more you realise you are being played. And what’s best about the game is the way it comes down to making a choice between doing the right thing, being a good lawyer, and keeping yourself out of trouble. You’re racing the clock to get the evidence you need and piece together a water-tight case, but ultimately the truth is much harder to find.   I actually have nothing negative to say about AA.
