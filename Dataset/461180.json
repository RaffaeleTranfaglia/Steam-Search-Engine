            "review_text": "This was my first time getting my hands on the Vive and I thought the game's tutorial introduced me to using this VR system nicely. SurrealVR's use of the controllers gave a good experience in being able to interact with a virtual world and others in it. I liked the set pieces and atmospheric sound design. This game offers a few different game options that help illustrate the power of the Vive (and VR in general), and gets me excited to see what new updates come out for this game.",

This game has real potential, especially given the developer's willingness to listen to our suggestions - speaking of which I have several to pass along, particulary on the controls. I can't wait for more people to discover this game as I can see it being a great place to hang out and meet new people.",
