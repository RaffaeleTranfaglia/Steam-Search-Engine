            "review_text": "It's a very fun game, and is surprisingly challenging. The problem is, the game is short and relies on the New Game+ mechanic for replay value. However, if you're looking at this game, it's probably for one thing:  -Making your own spells.-  To this end, the game really does shine. While certain elements are better than others, -most- of them are fairly balanced, such as the three 'DoT' elements. Burn spreads (which makes it really good in areas with lots of small enemies (Desert...)), Poison stacks on the same target, and Curse deals damage to nearby enemies when the target dies. Then you have two elements that change the mana cost of the spell (these are, in my opinion, not recommended for the wand, which deals little damage but uses no mana). Blood Contract gives the spell a boost to damage and effect, but causes the spell to consume health instead of mana. The other is the Arrow element, which removes mana cost (or causes the health cost to go down a ton in the case of Blood Contract + Arrow), however the spell now becomes more like a bow, with very limiting ammo that you have to then retrieve to continue firing.  The game also allows players of various playstyles to play the game. One of the artifacts, for example, increases the damage you deal and take by 1% for each enemy you kill, with it reseting when you finish the dungeon (it stacks multiplicatively, so your damage dealt and taken are doubled after the first 70 stacks.) Combine this with the Blood Contract spell effect (just be careful, as the Blood Contract's health cost increases too... I have gotten to points where I've killed so many enemies that the spells takes more health than I've got) and the Repulsor Energy robe effect (After taking damage, your next spell gets a massive damage boost), and you're looking at dealing huge amounts of damage. Conversely, you could make a shield spec revolving around Harpy Feather spell (pushes enemies back), Evercold Ice robe effect (supplies an absorption barrier after not taking damage for a couple seconds) and Lightning Rod robe effect (after a certain amount of time it creates a barrier that deflects incoming spells.) The options really are staggering.  So, despite the short playtime, I would definitely recommend this game. It's a lot of fun messing around with the spell mechanic to find something you like. Just be careful with that last boss...",

It's a short-ish game with vast replayability, the style is quite unique (I know, I know, there's Magicka and some other titles, but none compares to this little treasure), it has some small bugs, but most of them are hilarious, and it's easy to play, but hard to master.  The only thing that makes me sad about this game is knowing that there's no other plans about it, besides fixing bugs since the developers decided to start working on their next project.  Very recommended game!",

So many cool combinations of spells and wand effects to make, leading to endless strategy possibilities. Or just push all of your loot into a pile and go berzerk with it while mashing buttons and laughing maniacally. It's all possible and encouraged here.   It's worth $10-15 and is a steal at $5. Buy it now so you don't irrationally get mad at the studio when you come back in a month and it costs more. Buy it today so you don't feel stupid at a later date!",

Someone PM if I am wrong here but there are not many game that really let you tailor your actual no BS spells to looks and feel and act how you would like them too. Just needs more time and this game might just might make it to a forever play (i.e. Meatboy/Balloons TD). A little more random on the maps and a bigger story line or DLC would be great. It is like I have to give this game a 9/10 because after I beat the game the first time I did not feel the need to play it again but am hitting the follow button because 'I WANT MOAR CONTENT'. Time trials are cute but more spell and different bosses are going to be must.   Overall, worth every penny and you will only get more value out of this game when they add more content. ^_^  P.S. stacking mana for shield and 15% dodge might be a bit more powerful that you all might of thought. *Cheers* ",

If you *do* want that sort of excruciating thing, there are race courses, and new games + and so on.   It's deeper than you might think from that description, and the art/writing are warm and delightful. I actually looked forward to quest descriptions and so forth, because they were consistently good for a chuckle.   At some of the harder levels, everything turns into a damage sponge, but while that's occasionally annoying, there's enough dynamism in the levels (and each of the five worlds are all distinct in the kinds of motion they require--truly an elegant design direction) that it's usually an interesting new challenge.   Basically, I expected a toybox of Metroidvania items, and I got a fun game with character and depth and I had a great time. Thanks, developer!",

If you're an avid completionist, you'll probably get a lot more out of this game than I did, it has a plethora of extra challenges that require you to modify your spells in creative new ways that you'd never think of before.

            "review_text": "I love this game, and it certainly delivers the whole 'many, many combinations' thing. I've had lifestealing boulders, gigantic hand-shaped beams which curved towards enemies and set them on fire, ridiculously powerful magical swords; right now, I have a homing tri-beam with enough recoil to let me fly around the map, even without my quadruple jump.  The humor is great too, and I've wasted a good hour or so just paging through the descriptions and laughing at them. The dialogue pokes fun at archetypes and the absurdity of a society of wizards, and the physical humor's pretty great too when it shows up. It's all round a funny game.  Now for some things that aren't there. If you want story, this isn't the game for you. Boss fights are pretty lackluster too; they seem to be randomly generated in terms of attacks, but any two bosses from the desert area look almost identical, for example. In fact, the entire level seems to be random, from the times I've died and not recognised the layout when I got back.  Another problem I have is with the level gimmicks. All the areas I've been to have had one (except the starting area), and they're all fairly obnoxious - periodic sandstorms which damage you if you're outside, darkness which can only be lifted by expending a material slot and thus weakening your spells, and pseudo-puzzles where you have to push crystals while avoiding the boss. None of them are especially fun for me.  Overall though, this is seriously worth the money. The visuals have a very nice papery look, the choice of spells borders insanity, and the spells themselves provide fun, unique combinations which are great to just mess around with. Pick this one up if you feel like playing a fun, casual game with a playstyle to make your own.",
