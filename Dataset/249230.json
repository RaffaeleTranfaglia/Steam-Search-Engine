            "review_text": "This is a long review, so just read the bottom paragraph for a simple summary of my thoughts.  It surprises me that the general consensus for this game is worse than Risen 2: Dark Waters. To be fair, if you hated Risen 2, there likely are not enough redeeming factors about the end of the trilogy to be worth your while. But nevertheless, some substantial improvements to the overall experience have made this a promising step in the right direction for Piranha Bytes as a developer.  Risen 2: Dark Waters was ultimately a failure as an open world, engrossing RPG. It was extremely shallow, overall having one of their smallest and most lackluster world designs to date, with most of the islands consisting of winding pathways with few interesting landmarks leading between major locations. These locations were greatly devoid of life, as the characters were as dull and two-dimensional as wooden boards. The combat wasn't the worst I've ever seen in a game, but it took forever to get the necessary skills to stay on top of combat, and by then you just got used to button mashing between prayers. Beyond combat, half the skills in the game were worthless or used in only scripted situations that were easy enough to do without.  At first glance, or maybe even for the first couple hours, Risen 3 hardly seems any different. But if you put some effort into it, you'll find much more in store here. The combat system is widely criticized for the wrong reasons. To be fair, the easiest way to fail at Risen 3 was the only way to WIN in Risen 2: button mashing is heavily discouraged in Risen 3, as timing your combos poorly results in substantially slower attacks. Instead, the game encourages you to time your attacks with precision, and focus your efforts between multiple foes instead of trying to spam them to death one at a time. It also has a dodge maneuver, which Risen 2 lacked on release (and when they patched it in, it was hardly any more useful). In fact, the dodge led to quite the opposite criticism: that combat was too easy, since dodging made you invulnerable during the animation. (A patched-in 'Ultra' difficulty removes these invincibility frames, if you dare - as well as forcing a cooldown between potion uses.) Beyond that, skills you can learn from instructors give you a parry ability, faster combos, additional combo attacks, and further stat increases to make you unstoppable by the end of the game. It's still not a flawless combat system overall, but this is a world where Skyrim's dreadful DPS-focused combat dodges any ounce of criticism while a game like this is torn to pieces over a moderately tactical system.  The magic system is a bit unique, and certainly much more appealing than the lame voodoo system of Risen 2. Combat magic is available to all three factions, but much more varied to the Guardian faction. Some spells are equipped as a primary weapon and used in place of a sword - these spells can be used as a moderately-ranged attack in melee, or aimed as a projectile. Support magic can be placed in your quickbar for a single rapid cast, after which it requires a cooldown. Each faction has their unique spells which can only be acquired through the faction, but single-use versions (scrolls, voodoo dolls, runestones) can be found and used by any class as a disposable magical support with no cooldown. The only thing that truly disappointed me about the magic was that there was hardly any difference between the different types of offensive magic. Fire and Ice did the same amount of damage, for example, and had no unique effects, such as freezing enemies or igniting them. You only switched between them if you found an enemy who was immune to one and not the other.  The world design is notably improved. The game does re-use two islands from Risen 2, and scales them down considerably, but the new locations are significantly larger, have more to explore, and have areas of the map that open up as you complete more of the story. The maps themselves are a bit more open, but still tend toward a frustratingly path-focused design that makes most of the locations seem more linear than they really are. Thankfully, they've expanded the game in a vertical direction, allowing you a BIT more freedom in climbing. It's still obvious where you can and cannot climb, for the most part, but ambitious explorers may find rewards hidden in unexpected places if you can find a way. A large assortment of books can be found throughout, attempting to expand the game's lore or close some of the plotholes left between the previous titles.  I can't say the characters have improved significantly - there are plenty of fodder characters who just seem cut and paste from the previous game, and are often indistinguishable from others, but they've greatly increased in number, and the dialog has vastly increased as well. Many of the characters are still cringe-worthy or dull as dishwater, but a few still made a note with me as I played, such as the woeful Mortimer on Fog Island, the quiet yet stoic demon hunter Kane, and the misforunate Burke, many of whom have interesting quests or even just stories to tell.  You know what to expect with the questing - most RPG's these days have the same number of fetch or exterminate quests, but even in this regard, I'd say Risen 3 at least makes some of them more interesting. If you're feeling adventurous, make sure you disable quest markers - otherwise, if you're getting bored, use them to wrap up sidequests quickly. At least Risen 3's questgivers will tell you what to do and where to go, so you don't HAVE to depend on floating arrows to guide you if you don't want them.  The number of items in the game has increased, with more variety to melee weapons, magic, and firearms. Some of the weapons are mechanically indistinguisable from each other (crossbows vs. pistols, for example) yet require different skills to use. The 'legendary items' quests from Risen 2 make a return, and number slightly higher, providing potent stat increases. Unique weapons can be found in two pieces, to be reforged at a smithy - but with no clues on how to find these weapons, it's quite possible you'll have better ones by the time you find both pieces.  Unfortunately, the game again shipped with day-one DLC, with two story DLC's and one item-only one. Needless to say, developing gameplay content prior to release and charging separately for it is not a practice that consumers should ever endorse, but at least each DLC is slightly larger than Risen 2's, with a smaller price tag.  Final consensus: this game does not do enough to change the most vitriolic opinions about Risen 2. Nevertheless, Piranha Bytes appears to have taken some of the largest points of contention into consideration with Risen 3. Not everything got done that fans wanted, but in the shorter development time, dealing with internal restructuring and losing major designers, I think Piranha Bytes was able to focus on their most egregious sins and provide a substantial package that I don't regret paying for.",

This game isn't worth 50€ 25€ would have been appropriate. I lost hope in PB, won't buy anything from PB for now.   This game is even worse than Risen 2. I would even call it Risen 2.5.  The game pretty much feels like Risen 2 with factions. The fighting system is again pretty flawed and boring. I wish the developers would just take the one from Gothic 2 ... It was challenging and got never boring at all. This fighting system is a left click spamming fest to be honest.  The story feels like it was made one week before release. The quests are boring and dull. The voice acting (German) is pretty bad and unimaginative. The jokes are also lame and cringe-making.   The graphics are the same from Risen 2 and aren't even decent. Many textures are blurry and everything looks unfinished.   PB used to make great games with a great stories, a believable world and interesting and challenging quests. This game however feels like it was made quickly just to make money without any love.  PB, please just make games like Gothic 1 and 2 again. I know you can do it.",

It's hard to talk about Risen 3 without referring to the previous games, which I'll call 'PB games' for short.   To summarize:  Risen 3 is definitely a step up from Risen 2 but all in all, it is probably still a game that only fans of PB games will love and a game that only fans of the genre may learn to like.  To talk about this game more in-depth, I'll take the list I used for my reviews of 'Risen' and 'Risen 2'.   Melee combat",

However, patience is a virtue, and as you progress, a fun and addicting longing for adventure prevails. Piranha Bytes is known for its imagination in the genre of RPGs, and Risen 3 is yet another fine example.   This game is full of charms, and will keep you entertained for many hours. The voice acting is good, quests feel authentic and give you a sense of importance, and the overall objectives are virtually always clear. There is room for improvement in graphics and final polishing, but I'd give Risen 3 a solid 8 out of 10. It doesn't quite rival the brilliance of Skyrim, but for RPG fans, it's still a no brainer.",

            "review_text": "First impressions....objectively balanced! I've only parted five hours of my life, to Risen: Titan Lords. With these three hours, I must confess. I'm sold! However, I will admit faults where they are due. I'll outline the good, the bad and the ugly.  The Good 1) Shiny enviroments to look at! Crystal clear water, and reflective water bring life to the world. Much improved over number 2 in the series. 2) Combat mechanics, the skill system is similiar to Dark Waters. They've improved on the 'wheel' so to speak.  3) UI layout, it's simplistic and opitmized. You wont feel, it's a waste of space. Since it barely takes away from the visual sights. 4) The music, it's well done. 5) Swaggity swag, more swag than you could possibly swag out to.   The Bad 1) Sounds and atmospheric immersion. Combat sounds are sub-par. The enviroment sounds, just seem off. I know, pervious incarnations have had these issues. Hopefully, patches/mods will fix it. 2) LOS on enemies, so far mobs just seem to see you at a ridiculous range. Sneaking, definitely helps trim that. Movement can be awkward and disorienting at first. Just need to adjust. 3) Lack of interface options for fullscreen mode. Game started out windowed, I had to ini file, fix it. Not a major deal, but easily fixable via placed in-game options.  4) Character identity confusion? Okay, minor spoiler...you're not the nameless hero from the other games. Yet, you're with Patty and the character is Steelbeards son. However, you're still nameless. I call him 'Ted Dos Lagos' we get it Piranha Bytes, you don't name the 'heroes'. I'm sure, ya'll over there have some inside joke about it. It's from the Gothic days, and eventually the heroes name get's revealed.   The Ugly 1) Claw monkeys!  2) Facial expressions and animations. They just don't really have a quality feel, it's irky. The combat animations, aren't amazing. Yet, it could've been better. I know, the guys at Piranha Bytes, have it in them.  3) Lesser polished look on model textures and meshes for bodies They took a step backwards, this go around. Dark Waters, had really nice textures and meshes. I will admit, the armor looks pretty dope, which helps overlook the body.  4) Dead Veggies, you'll spot dead vegetation on living healthy plants here and there...it's weird to see. I know it adds immersion, it just looks off. Minor gripe of mine. 5) The dialogue, lots of sarcastic remarks. Lots of profanity for profanity sake. Sailors, like doing that. The voice acting is ugly, but it's not terrible.   7.5/10  Overall, based on my first impressions. It's solid follow-up to Dark Waters. It needs some patching, needs some shiny boot polish, needs a bath. However, it's Risen the only successor to Gothic. You get, what you pay for. If you're a true zealot of the old Gothic series, whom are rare. Give the Risen franchise some more thought and maybe even you can help improve it. I will say, we'll never have another Gothic II. I'm okay with that too. I genuinely feel, the guys/gals at Piranha Bytes, have the best intentions at heart for their products.  Edit: I'm just going to add, if you do still enjoy Gothic II, in all of it's fantastic glory. There are a few mods out there. The community is dim and with little life, I know World of Gothic closed their doors. Folks, are out there though. Just need to try and find them.",

Don't like that pirate-setting? It's just the tutorialmap, afterwards there is not very much of that left.  Personally i liked it, even though it often feels less mature than Gothic1,2,3. But hey, it's not that you're drowning in major quality RPGs to be picky, is it? :)  It does many things better than R2 (combat, feats, size of world) and it does many things equally good/bad (quite shallow story, ocasionally repetitive fights, etc.) but in the end it's still funny to explore, find the secrets, discover things, visit new islands, fight sea monsters, have sea battles, take different companions with you, etc.  Biggest plus is that the companions (of which there are some to choose) now respond more to the world you are and to the things you do. Sadly their commentary in battles start getting repetitive and annoying pretty soon.  Although the Gnomes are not nearly as funny as Borderland's Claptrap, they're quite cute and often good for a smile.  One plus to mention is the balancing. I'm the explorer type and discovered nearly everything so the final island (which is not really small) i could master in well earned god-mode :) So if you're just rushing through it, it could be a bit more challenging.   tl;dr: Recommended if you liked Gothic1,2,3 or Risen1&amp;2.

Now I'm in the game for 8 hours and I must say, that it is difficult to get away from the game. It is not political correct, which is such a relief. It is not the top notch technologie, but it doesn't matter. It uses vivid candy grafics, which soothes (I found myself just walking the beach to collect clam :) for 10 min.)  All in all it is more Gothic 3 than it is Risen. I really enjoy this game and was long waiting for something like this. If you are a Gothic-Series fan, you can buy Risen 3. Well, it is not as difficult as G3, it is not so political incorrect as G3, but for the time being it is just at least s.th. good. Really missed. :) A must buy!",

However, that doesn't matter since this final game finishes the series close to perfectly. From the first moment of playing Risen to this last moment of Risen 3, the series has made me replay the games several times, that's how good they are.   There are a few noticeable differences between Risen 3 and Risen/Risen 2, apart from improved graphics of coure. In Risen 3, the combat is slightly different, as many people before me has noticed aswell. While the combat in itself is very cool and not very hard, your character is pretty weak and your NPC companion has to help you quite a bit. At least in the beginning.   In Risen 3, you don't play as the character from the previous games. You play as Patty's brother, who I hadn't heard about before playing Risen 3. But that doesn't matter too much since you get to know him during the game and there's a little surprise somewhere in the game if you've played the other games...  I highly recommend playing this game if you've played the former Risen games first, if you haven't. you risk losing out on a lot of the precious story. The combat gets better and better the more you play and it's the kind of game you just want to keep playing, even after finishing it. Even more so since there are different factions that you can join, changing the gameplay for every playthrough (to a certain point).",

The game is way too easy for a 'Gothic' game. No real challenge, all you need is your trusty fireball spam and you are good to go.  Overall the story is not that great and engaging as the one Gothic 1 or 2 was. Characters are plain and have not much depth to them. In Gothic even a simple guard was more interesting than a named NPC is in Risen 3. Simply put, there is not enough character development going on in Risen 3. (For example Milten the mage from the old camp becomes a close friend later on in the story of Gothic, turns out to be one of the closest helpers of the Nameless hero and in the end helps restore the blade Uriziel. Something like this was missing from Risen 3.)  The game is fun overall after the first playthrough, but after that, it becomes bland and not that interesting at all. Maybe it is, because it is so simple or it's just me who expected it to be even more challenging than the original Gothic 1 and 2.  Overall, if you are a new generaion player and want to try a 'Gothic' game, Risen 2 and 3 are the games for you. If you are up to the challenge, try Gothic 1 and 2 too. (Even though if you ask for my opinion, neither is Gothic 1 and 2 that hard for new generation players to play it, but whatever...)  Piranha Bytes should have focused more on PC players who expect difficult RPGs from them and put less console like tutorials and mechanics in Risen 3. I almost felt like they were holding both of my hands while I was playing. Consoles really ruined this game the most as I see it.  The DLCs are a sorry excuse of aditional content. They are by far not that satisfying as one would expect. The 2 islands added have only a few quests and even though you meet some old faces from Risen 1 and 2, they didn't hold my interest for long. 1 hour of gameplay per Island is not worth 10€.  Even after all this, I still recommend this game, but you should buy it once there will be a discount, as it is by far not worth 50€. Maybe if they upped the difficulty a bit and added more depth to characters, Risen 3 could have been the game we all waited for so long. (And of course less hand holding and console nonsense.)",

Muskets felt really underpowered in this title. But magic is straight up powerful and feels (and looks) pretty nice. I really like that they don't use a mana system in this title but rather cooldowns only. It helps to remove those annoying downtimes I really liked the idea of the parrot spell, where you can just fly around the world for a limited time. A stronger version you can learn would have been great though Like in the previous title there are some minigames you can play in most major cities, which is a nice idea although not a time dump like in some other games.  The very numerous quests played out nice. The map system has a solid design. The fast travel points are well placed enough to be helpful and still in 'believable' locations. As in all RPG titles the story plays a major role. The story telling is pretty solid in this title. The story is interesting to the end although nothing too new. For fans of the series there are a lot old acquaintances to meet. The voice acting was pretty solid, although some npcs obviously shared voices. Calling spiders insects all the time drove me nuts though (Yes, I know that in olden times people probably didn't know, but still).

Character appearance and gender fixed.  Not a great RPG but a good one so give it a try.",

Combat can be a bit trying, especially when even oversized chicken monsters can somehow parry sword swings, but all in all it is still a decent game, just don't go in expecting something like the Witcher 3. 6/10.",

Although this game does have its flaws so far the voice acting is sub par but the dialoge is good (ive only meet a few main charcters though so far, but the main charcater is really the worst compared to all the other pb games, imo. But then again im a mel blanc fan, so im a kinda snob for good voice acting) the movement is very stiff of your character, and take some feeling out at first. Ive gotten used to the melee... and the magic from all the differnt factions looks crazy sick! (as in awesome, which pb has always been good at mage combat, again imo) ... and once you get used to attacking only when you need too, and same with dodgeing, it turns into a game of patience, kinda dark souls style but not necessarily as difficult, but still fun and rewarding (btw, i really like the dodgeing system, where you double tap the move keys in the direction you want to go compared to the camera angle rather than where your character facing.) ive been playing 3 and a half hours now and ive still only been to one island and im nowhere near explored all the lush forsest full of beast and minions, and the cliffs (conveniently staircase-like so you can climb it up and up and up, lol, I guess it gives me an old school nostalgia;) I really enjoy Risen 3 and after I got past the beginning, it started feeling like a world i wanted to explore. (reminds me most of gothic 1 &amp; 2 quest-wise where you've got your three factions, and gameplay handleing/movement, its very much like its predecessors. To me the movement could be less clunky, (which makes it hard for me to play it with a controller) I cant wait to get my magic going though, itll be a whole new game after that! Two thumbs up from me (was a bit pricey but like i said ive been a fan since gothic 1.) No regrets here...",

Game says you can chain 3 hits. No you can not at all. 2 hits fairly easily but the 3rd will always be interupted by an enemy attack and even power attacking enemy block will just cause them to hit you first or roll away instead. Combat ends up being this really slow boring grind of slash roll slash roll. Theres no real strat as you get frames when you roll even if the attack hits you. It feels like it tried to be a budget darksouls combat system and ended up just being trash. Story is meh. Not much to say but pirates and feels like a recycled plot from the second game but much more watered down.

            "review_text": "Don't let the metacritic rating fool you, but don't expect BioWare quality either.  Risen 3 is a solid and competent roleplaying game. Featuring a decent magic and combat system, interesting variations on 'classess' (factions within the game), interesting and attractive environments, a good looting and gear system and a good chunk of play time, its a game that can be easily enjoyed with a little patience and forgiveness. The leveling system is complex and interesting, asking you to increase stats to be able to learn perks and improvements to your combat abilities, which can be bought from trainers scattered all over the world.  What is wrong with the game are niggles and annoyances more than bugs or bad concepts, and even then are only highlighted because we, as consumers, have come to expect things that aren't provided here. For example, the story told in the game is threadbare and confusing, never coherently explaining what's going on or why we should care. This is only exacerbated by the dubious voice acting, particularly by your own character who speaks in a constant gruff monotone. There are allusions to the past games that can make it even more confusing, such as a cameo by the past two games protagonist that should be foreshadowing and cool but is instead just strange.  The dialogue options are not the range you would expect for an RPG, giving you little choice and little chance to actually roleplay, being limited to gruff piratey responses rather than varied. The combat system takes some getting use to, and requires a combination of attack, dodge, parry and riposte, and enemies have a tendency to mob you even when there are other characters attacking them, resulting in a lot of constant dodging and pot shots until their ranks are thinned and you're back in control. This can sometimes be exacerbated by clipping problems, or the mobile camera being blocked by scenery.  Overall, Risen 3 is worth playing and enjoyable if your expectations aren't too high, and I would recommend playing it when the price drops to a level that is better value for money.",

I will say that I watched some reviews whining and complaining on how bad this is or how 'average' this is but I recommend you get the game on sale if you're uneasy about it. I received it as a gift and I personally think it's been unjustly panned by reviewers. The combat has a learning curve but when you get used to the timing, it can be pretty fun. The story is kinda crazy, most of the characters are nicely voiced with unique attitudes (The shaman is really weird though), but there are moments when you will see a characters face that resembles a previous character you have encountered. Some voices seem off in how the dialog is delivered and the shaman, though funny at times, can get repetitive with his one liners during combat. There is a ton of content in this game and surpirsingly the graphics look quite nice though not mindblowing as this is also on PS3. Thankfully the PC version looks and performs much better (Duh). For those who want fluid smooth animations though, you may not like the attack animations, though it's not as bad as demonicons slo-mo loaded combat. Some may also be put off by the need for gold to learn skills, but you can find places in this game where they basically throw gold at you, if you take on a lot of side quests. The story has a sort of pirate theme but it's overall a means to an end. If you want a blockbuster story, you won't find it here. You may find great gameplay and hours of quests to kill time, but not much hand holding. The map is a very appreciated addition over Risen 2, I found it frustrating that Risen 2 lacked a map, making pathfinding really tedious. You also have 3 factions to choose from, each with unique abilities and gameplay. Overall, there are a lot of reasons to give Risen 3 a try, save for the so-so story.

The game is rough around the edges, but has more personality and charm than you'll get out of the latest Dragon Age. It harkens back to a time when people were more concerned with what they could do than how it looked to be doing it.  Once you get through the fairly standard 'tutorial' and intro sequence, the game opens up. You are free to make mistakes and follow the story at your own leisure and choosing. This means you can go places you shouldn't be and do things that make your life harder. This isn't a point-and-click follow the dotted line adventure, this time you are in charge with nothing more than your sense of adventure and desire to explore to fuel you. Thanks PB!

The hero first has to swing his blade for even a standard attack. This gives the enemys plenty of time to attack themselves. Basically, the hero needs about one second to commence a standard attack, while an enemy needs half the time. Thus you can expect the enemy to hit you during your attack, interrupting it. Enemies do combo attacks, meaning they will knock you back and onto the ground without you being able to do anything. Even on the starting island, I spent more time laying on the ground than actually doing anything. Feels strongly reminescent of the boars from Gothic 3. Only in Risen 3, pretty much every enemy is a boar. Now imagine fighting enemies in groups. As long as there isn't some proper balancing here, I can't recommend this game.",

            "review_text": "The best looking game in the series but the laziest and weakest overall.  Except for the visuals there really isn't anything that's improved since Risen 2 and much has gotten worse.   The Good:  I like the visuals, the enhanced edition really looks good. The models, the colors, and the overall look and feel of the environments are well done. There are are few small anomalies here and there but nothing horrible or overly distracting. Weather effects could be a bit better, but it doens't really take away anything.  I like the magic. While I haven't used all the systems if the others are similay to the way voodoo works then that's pretty good. While magic isn't a very in depth process it's interesting and diverse enough to be fun to use.  I have always liked the quest system, where you can complete the goals of a quest even before you get assigned the quest. So if you kill all the creatures in some corner and then come across a guy who gives you the quest to go kill the creatures in that corner, you can complete it right then and there.  Some minor (and major) rewards for exploring. I like being able to look up at some rocks and ask 'What's up there?' and much of the time I am able to clime up there and find something there; a dead body, some gold or food, or whatever. Very rarely have I been disappointed from randomly exploring the areas.    The Bad  So mcuh of in this game is left over from the previous games. Very little is completely new. You'll interact with just about everyone you met before in the previous games, many of these meetings are forced and add absolutely noting to the plot. Especially the ones you meet in your very short stints into the underworld which are forced upon you at various times when you go to sleep. Boring and a complete waste of time.  Combat still sucks ♥♥♥. You pretty much have the same moves you did in Risen 2 and most of the enemies still use the same tired old attack routines. Save for a couple of the newer mini bosses and bosses every creature uses the same attack pattern that existed in previous game. It truly boggles my mind that an alligator has teh exact same attack pattern as the wild beaked birds. Combat adds almost nothing new in installment. Even my voodoo combat is the same as my melee combat save that it will hit multiple creatures rather than just one. Not to mention even on hard this game is easy save for the random times the AI just goes ballistic and starts throwing up a stream of attacks there is no way you can defend against. Also, some monsters, despite how powerful your armor is, will kill in one hit if you fail to dodge. Combat is an annoying chore instead of a fun activity.  Auto saves: Autosaves are nice, but they are very strangely activated. Most are okay, but there are times where they should be used when they're not. An autosave should activate right a fast travel and tehy aren't. If you forget to save after a fast trave to your ship and then travel to another island and then get killed by something on the beach, when you reload you'll be way back on that other island. Also, I have encounterd puzzles where once you solve them you get ambushed and if you don't save and get killed you have to solve the puzzle again. One took me 10 minutes to solve and I got ambushed, die almost instantly, and had to redo the god damn puzzle. That's a horrible flaw. Autosave on complete puzzles is a must.  Vague quest resolution: A few quests are completely vague in how they are supposed to be resolved. One in particular I have done every single quest on the isle of mages and all I get is 'I still have soem things to do before we can start' with absolutely no clue what I need to do or am waiting for.  Companions: Kinda hand for combat, though they're really slow to start fighting (I can fimish most foes before the companion even makes one attack) they are almost always in your way when you wanna loot the corpses. You have to specifically make sure the corpse is highlighted because you companion will usually be right here in your face when trying to loot. This is annoying as hell.  The underworld: Often times when you sleep you're whisked away into a stint in the underworld which serves one of two purposes. So you can have a brief chat with someone you killed in Risen 2 which adds nothing to the game in the least and another to collect 'soul dust' which can help elevate your soul rank, but they always end abruptly as you collect one or two and then a creature appears and kicks you out of the underworld.  The Ugly  The main character is a complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. This guy is absolute o fun to play unless you want to be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Even if you follow the 'good' path everything that comes out of this guys mouth is pure garbage. Even when you select the nice dialoge option the character sounds like he's ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off that he even has to talk to someone else. He has set a new standard for me as most unlikable video game protagonist ever.   This game is a disjointed mess. All of its parts do not equal up to its whole. Most of its parts are average at best, a few are good, more are bad, and a lot just doesn't make any sense. All in all, I'm just not really enjoying this game. Risen 2 was so much better.",

            "review_text": "A pretty good game for sure! I got about 60 hours of fun with it using both DLCs.   On the plus side    Great exploration! They don't limit you so don't be surprised when you finish a quest you didn't even know about yet.   Graphics are quite nice. There's an 'enhanced' edition rumored but the stock graphics are really quite nice.   Good quests. Organization of the quest log can be a bit dicey (was that an island quest or a crew quest??) but having so many quests that they can be a bit hard to track is a great problem to have.   A nice sprinkling of good humor.   Mostly bug-free. There are a few bugs here and there but nothing that really hurt my fun.   Good autosave PLUS quick save PLUS named save system. Why can't all games do this?    On the minus side    Manual level scaling (see below).   Too few monster types.   Sea battles start interesting but get tedious. (Luckily, there's only a few.)   Inventory gets too huge to find things.   The game is open world and is intent on letting you go wherever you want, with only a few areas locked off. Unfortunatly, that means that at least half of each island is full of stuff you can defeat with your starting character! (The fog island DLC is an exception to this.) So, once you finish a bunch of the first island you go to, the second will be a bit easy and the others will be a LOT easy. To counter that, you'll need to up the difficulty level as you go along - essentially doing your own level scaling.  The game has lots of crafting. You can craft potions, rum, spell scrolls/stones/dolls, and so on. I collected TONS of crafting ingredients but I barely used any. Why? See the previous paragraph. Why bother making yourself stronger when the game isn't difficult?  While the game has major balance issues as the game goes on, don't let that throw you. The game is fun! Just don't make yourself too powerful and keep pushing the difficulty up. There's much to see and many, many people to chat with!",

The map is almost identical to Risen#2, gameplay mechanics, very similar. Graphics, again, no major evolution.   The worst thing about this game though, is the horrendous decision, to move away from the nameless here we played in Risen#1 and Risen#2 and introduce a completely new protagonist, Patty's brother. WTF ? Whoever smart guy at game studio made that decision aught to be taken out the back and flogged. Long-term fans of the franchise like me were looking forward to Patty and the Nameless hero finally getting together in Risen#3. Totally unfinished plot arc from the first 2 games.  Now, to be clear I loved the Risen franchise, up until #3. I have recommended the original Risen, and also Risen#2 multiple times. How could the devs be so dumb as to completely change up the protagonist we came to know and love in the first 2 games ? Not only that, the world is almost the same as that of Risen#2 with the addition of a couple of scorch marks and some fog.  I totally cannot recommend this game. I am bored with it now, I already played Risen#2 and I dont want to play Risen#2.5 which is what this game really aught to have been called. Game uninstalled, and not completed.  So, the major gripes about Risen#3 :  - Same maps as Risen#2, just with some minor changes - Different protagonist from the one we spent 60+ hours with if we played the first 2 games - Game feels cheap and definitely not as well done as first 2 games  So basically IMHO Risen#3 is a cheap piece of crap and a money-making scheme on the Risen name from the developers.

ALSO, there are no pros because this game did not impress me in any way; therefore, i did not find it important for me to say something like, 'Yeah, this part wasn't totally bad', or 'I guess they did this part okay-ish'.       I found this game to be a waste of $50. I mean, the game looks and feels like a game i played back in 2003, and it's not even as good as that one. Now, let me elaborate a bit on what i found to be bad about different parts of the game.    First and foremost, the combat system. Absolutely awful combat; it feels like you're playing an RTS game(They attack, you block, you attack, they block or don't). Not to mention the fact that it's nearly impossible to kill more than one enemy if you don't have a follower. To sum this one up, the combat is, like i said earlier, an annoying RTS game.   Next let's talk about the voice acting. It's horrendous. I mean, the way people talk makes it impossible for you to be immersed. To sum this one up, you'd be better off using JUST the subtitles.   And last, let's talk about the graphics. Well, there isn't much to say about the graphics, seeing as they are pretty non-existent(that's an exaggeration, of course). But really, they are pretty awful-even on max to near max settings. To sum this one up, the graphics are similar to that of a game made back in around 2010(Just an estimate)  Now, to sum everything up, i would avoid this game unless you are a hardcore Risen fan that doesn't mind poor game development, or you just don't mind poor game development and think this game is fun.",

Positive: + Graphically it is pretty good, with latest patch they've improved texture resolutions. FPS does drop when everything is maxed out. + Story is fine. At least I didn't forget what I was supposed to do, when playing this game only 1-2 times a week + Minigames. Although simple, some of them are pretty fun to play. + Exploration. The game always encourages you to look for something special that is hidden near by. It is a very rewarding experience + Map design, overall pretty good and with a nice variety.  Negative: - Combat. The most frustrating combat experience ever. I couldn't find any other game where combat experience was that bad. Controls have a lot of delay, some keys don't register so you have to mash the buttons multiple times to make sure it will. The overall dodge mechanic is just annoying and doesn't make the combat fun in any way. In fact, while you are dodging you are complete invulnerable to damage ? Batman Arkham series have shown what a good fun and fluit combat should be like, take notice Piranha Bytes !  - AI. I don't even know if there is an AI in this game. Pretty much all the enemies just charge straight towards you, and go into attack/dodge cycle. Funny thing almost every single monster in the game behaves pretty much the same way, shouldn't there be a better variation of enemy AI, maybe ? Companions pretty much the same thing, while they do follow you, sometimes they just get stuck and become missing, or they go and run away from you, just to hit a monster. And why enemy AI always targets me first ? The fact that I have companions doesn't seem to matter to them. - Glitchy and buggy, for some reason the game kept crashing on me, I occasionally get stuck in the walls, enemies don't care and just go through them. Many other minor issues as well. - Difficulty spikes. In the beginning when you are going with melee, you are going to be destroyed a lot. In the end when you go with magic you are going to destroy everything so easily that game becomes extremely easy. Shouldn't there be a different difficulty curve, like easy in the beginning and harder in the end instead ?",

            "review_text": "If you liked the other Risen games then this does follow in the franchise foot steps. I think it is an under rated game. It runs flawlessly with no crashes and the graphics/sound are good. The story is a bit weak but there are lots of great characters and many side quests to follow. I got a good 56 hours of playtime doing all of the dlc and most of the side quests. Many of the sidequests are fetch this and that but there is enough variety to keep you interested. Combat again is more or less hack and slash if you play as melee as I do.",
