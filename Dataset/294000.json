Take on current friends and future frenemies in any of the incredibly fun game modes, ranging from Last Man Standing to Medieval soccer. All of that using only weapons from the middle age… and laser guns… and miniguns.",

One of those fun games i like to pass the time with a friend or friends when waiting to play another game or just feel like playing something different although the match making can be annoying if your trying to have a private match since not many people seem to be in lobby at one time but that wont stop me from buying the dlc and enjoying this game more.  *Controller recommended but not needed*",

More pros than I could list. Only drawbacks: Nobody playing online at present, spawn locations are not spaced out intelligently when playing with less than 8 players, and no map maker! One might wonder why a map maker would be an expected feature, but when you see the maps in knight squad it will become clear why I'm not the first to recognize how awesome that would be.",

            "review_text": "Knight Squad is simple to understand, it's fun, and doesn't require much skill to play.  Some people hate on it for that reason : it's too random and not skill-based enough. Maybe. I would tend to believe those people simply have trouble seeing where in Knight Squad is skill required (ie. moving so that your sword ends at the right place while your character doesn't end impaled), but let's admit they're right. Is this game made for huge esports tournaments where skill is everything and randomness has no place because of the money at stake? Nope, it's just a family-friendly party game for everyone...  But let's forget about that and focus on the game itself. When I booted it, what greeted me? A nice interface that automatically chose the correct resolution (2560*1440, which isn't properly detected or even supported by way too many games), and an options menu that let me remap controls.   Of course, I remapped the keyboard first, since it's not QWERTY. Then, I plugged in an xbox controller, which obviously didn't need remapping. Then I plugged in an old usb1 controller that's some kind of chinese knockoff of a ps1 controller. It worked and I remapped it so the game was playable with it. Then I plugged in a Gamecube controller adapter I got on Aliexpress for 8€ a while ago, and plugged two gamecube gamepads on that adapter. Each Gamecube gamepad was tied to a player and remapped.  The result? I got 5 characters that could be played properly, with literally zero investment because I already had several old controllers. And I could get 8 players like this if I moved my butt downstairs to get the other old controllers.  My point is, it's really well made on the technical side of things, and that's a big plus. Contrary to Clusterpuck 99 that disappointed me a lot on that matter (doesn't allow remapping so anything non-xbox is useless), Knight Squad truly has a solid technical foundation.   Now, for the gameplay, I can't say that I've played a lot, but it does look fun. Several game modes, tight controls (it's not twin stick but that's a gameplay choice, not a missing feature, for anyone that would think otherwise), nice graphics (nothing pixelated because of stretched textures)... Looks like the family reunion will be fun this year.   I'll try to think of updating that review as soon as I've spent some time playing it in December, but for now I really want to make it clear that 80% of the negative reviews have been written by disingenuous and/or stupid people.",
