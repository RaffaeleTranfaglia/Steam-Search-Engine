            "review_text": "It's an ok experience for that price. Basically you get 4 places to explore if you don't include the starting place. As for gaming goes, there's absolutly nothing to do in these places except for launching fireworks in one of them. However, the fireworks were really well made with good sounds and visuals, and made it a joy to watch. I thought all scenes seemed a bit empty, with few details and things to look at. If it would had provided better details overall, like in one scene you can see the raindrops moving down the window, it could have been a very nice experience, but the world seems very empty and static. It still delivers good sounds and who doesn't find sitting in a cabin in the woods, while the rain is pooring outside, relaxing? You basically get what you're paying for, and for that price you really can't complain over what you get.  ",

As somewhere just to sit and chill and relax, it's great. Would be even better if there were more interactive elements such as the fireworks, or different times of day etc. But for the cost its a relaxing diversion.",
