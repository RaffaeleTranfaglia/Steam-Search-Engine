            "review_text": "I bought this game in a sale for really cheap, but it totally worth the whole price without any discounts. The game has a really nice enjoyable theme and really nice art work. Love how happy this game is meanwhile also everything is turned upside down by evilness. The story itself is also really nice, there totally has been thought good about it and all makes sense in the end. Even though the game isn't that hard, the final boss really is hard. It takes a really long time. Because of that I didn't played it for a few little months and just now tried it again. Once you understand it, it will get easy but still takes a lot of time. So I realised I gave up way too soon. Regretting that now.  The only down point I would give this game is about the little side missions you can do. I would go out and search for whatever I needed to find but when you realised you've gone way to far into the game, you cannot finish that quest anymore. Meanwhile it keeps staying in your journal.   But anyways, a really good joyfull game for that price. :3",
