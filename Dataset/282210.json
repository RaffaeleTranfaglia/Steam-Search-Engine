            "review_text": "**UPDATE** - This review was written with the game running on 'Hard'  This is the worst game I've played that bears Sid Meier's name.  'Surely it's not that bad' You say.  I'm afraid it is.  In the build up to the release of the game there was little doubt that it was going to be a less involved game to play then the typical Sid Meier fare, more Ace Patrol then Civilization 5. When developers were discussing the game, that was pretty clear and I have no qualms with that.  In fact I was quite happy with the idea of a strategy game designed so I could play over an evening after work.  The 3 hour play time of this review was playing a game to completion on a 'large' map.  Initial impressions are poor. The game launching in a tiny window and into a bare, personality-less main menu that could have been ripped from any sci-fi title (it reminded me of the Sword of the Stars 2 menu). I sought out the settings menu and within that I found volume controls and 'Windowed Full Screen mode'.  I'm sorry what?  I know the game was being made for tablet as well, but this is Firaxis. I asked another friend playing it 'Am I missing a settings menu somewhere?' bemusedly. 'Nope' He replied 'It really is that sparse'  Oh well. Not a great first impression, but not necessarily the end of the world. I setup a game.  Setup lets you pick a faction and a leader. Each faction gets the same leaders, with slightly rejigged artwork. Which comes across as a bit lazy. The factions have a unique bonus with the leaders adding an additional bonus of their own. I was a little bemused at what the various bonuses meant as I only knew about one aspect of the game (crew morale) from previews nothing else made a lot of sense and there was nothing to explain the benefits of a choice, no tooltips, nothing.   The lack of tooltips persists throughout, with a general lack of accessible information.  I setup my game, stabbing blindly in the dark at things that sounded useful   The galactic playing field looks alright and I wait for the useful tutorial to kick in and explain things to me over my first few turns. I get nothing. I understand there's an info button to click but I don't understand why there's a lack of tutorial and I fumble around the first few turns getting to grips with the games systems.  As the game is all about moving a fleet around space bringing disparate planets into a federation you'd expect load out/designing of the ships to be one of the most involved aspects of the game. Instead, you're presented with a list of things to click away at to upgrade or downgrade (removing components nets you some resources back to spend elsewhere) different aspects of each ship.  My fleet consisted of three ships throughout the course of the game, starting as corvette's, ending as battleships through upgrades and the games automatic ship classification. All 3 focused on speed, one was paticularly tough and loaded with close range weaponry. One was less tough, also had close range weaponry and could cloak. One had longer range weapons. The limitation to what you can actually do with ships meant all of them had max speed, and were stupidly tough by about mid way through. But this simple setup felt game breaking. I could defeat any mission or enemy fleet, outside of the missions where you have to defend an outpost that can only survive two hits with fast enemies that just head straight for it.  The empire building aspect of the game is no more involved. 'Click this to make numbers go up, because numbers' about sums up this aspect of the game. There's no interesting trade off between balancing metal, food or energy. Get lots of whatever you can, click stuff to have more stuff.  I actually beat my game accidentally. I was working my way from planet to planet, building one ludcriously over powered wonder after another because why not, then a conquered a planet which also had a wonder and triggered the wonder victory.  Well victory nets you a much more rewarding end then it does in Beyond Earth at least. You get 10 seconds of video which is better then a text box. But does it really matter when the rest of the game is so unengaging?  Overall, it's an ok game to have on a tablet, nothing stand out, even where there isn't much competition. But on the PC there's tons. Weird Worlds in Infinite space did something similar but better years ago and it's Early Access sequel likely will to. There is no reason to buy this game for the PC, and very little for a tablet.",

            "review_text": "Alright, so, I finished one playthrough and tried to start few new games with different settings, here is the impression so far:   Gameplay: +Simple to understand resource management +-Some super basic diplomacy that creates a light feeling of space empire game, although, you can break peace and attack your opponent the very same turn which kind of completely defeats the point of a diplomacy +Few different ways to build up your ecocnomy\\strength +Fleet upgrades are very flexible and allows for some interesting ship specialites +Fights are decently strategic although: -(huge minus, I ragequit the game few minutes ago because of that) Asteroid moving system(unless it is a bug). So, let me make an example: I hid my fleet behind a formation of really big asteroids, launched a few fighters, checked my LOS and every ship on the enemy team was untargetable. Clicked Next Turn. First thing I see is that an asteroid that was right in front of my fleet dissapeared and now 5 enemy ships are shooting me with 100% damage modifier. Now. If it is a system, there has to be some form of an indicator of which ones are moving(not necessary the location, but just an idea of which cover cannot be reliably used). If it was made for preventing people from defensive camping - good, but in this case you might remove all the asteroids as there is no way to predict your enemy's next turn(it is a strategy game , afterall). If it is a bug - GOD, this has to be fixed as soon as possible. I am EXTREMELY interested in the point of view of any developer\\community manager on that topic.  UI: +planetary management is simple enough and UI does it's job -No HP/Weapons/Modules indicators (that I've seen) on enemy ships aside from the info on a pre-mission briefing. How can I tell if the ship is going down soon? How can I tell if that ship is stronger at close combat? Which ship should I target?  -Line of sight is really hard to manage, there is no visible indicator if the ship is in range of attack OR if the ship will be able to attack after the move (again, it is a strategy game not an aracde shooter). Defeats the idea of tactical movement, you just HOPE that your lasers will reach -No Indicator of which weapon will be used at the certain distance, Would be great to see a tri-colour targetting arrow that shows which weapon will you fire at what range. I think it is a simple to implement and yet very important feature(again, we are trying to make tactical decisions in a STRATEGY game) -Diplomacy screen is super-simple(also, very small for some reason) and a bit hard to understand from the first glance, and I am used to the complex screens of CIV and other 4x games +Global view gives just enough information to the player, very functional and not cluttered.   Graphics: +- Functional, nothing to praise, nothing to complain about -No options. I want to skip\\speed-up animation on a global view, same in the battle screen. Every CIV game has it...   Overall: I REALLY want to like this game, I was excited from the moment I heard about it. I have done the pre-order and... I think it was a mistake. The game has potential, but it is buried behind tons of questionable decisions. In ideal world it is a fun, fast, strategy game, that can be finished within an hour. As it stands, I have very little desire to start a new playthough after I learned some of the flaws. I helped design\\QA some UI for Network Software and I am genuinely surpised how most of the things I mentioned as a negative were missed\\not mentioned during the development process.  You might have a different experience than I did, maybe it is just a matter of personality.  Regards,   Dark Sun",

            "review_text": "I don't usually write reviews, but in this case I needed to make an exception.  97 minutes.  Yep, that's how long it took to start up the game, futz around with it a bit looking for settings, reading the options for your new commander and then win.  I know - it's a bit slow, but in my defense, I did actually read the initial missions thinking there would be something deeper there. There isn't.  Get enough energy to build your ships up to battleships, take enemy home planet (which gives you instantly everything they own) and rinse / repeat for however many players there are. No need to build wonders, cities, or anything else meaningful (though I did waste at least half of that 97 minutes doing just that thinking it would matter.)  Makes you wonder as to the replay value, though I suppose if I'm truly bored I can try a variety of the missions just to try them out.  Sorry, Sid. For as much entertainment your games have provided me over the years - this one just plain stinks.  ",

            "review_text": "I have followed (and enjoyed immensely) Sid Meier games from the very first one in the early 1980s and I must say that StarShips is my first major let down.  At a glance, this game looks like a hybrid between Civilization Lite and Ace Patrol. After playing a few games, Starships fails to live up to either one of those titles; it is an unbalanced mess with very little replayability. The only reason to replay it is to unlock perks in Civ : BE. (Scroll to the end of the the review for info on this feature).  An iPad app at best, Starships is devoid of personality, customization and meaningful choices for the player.  Ship upgrades could have been this title's saving grace but after a certain point, all your ships will have impenetrable shields, lethal lasers and cannons and enough fighter squadrons to avoid combat almost entirely. For a game which is supposedly centered on tactical gameplay, this seems like a pretty major flaw.  Sadly, after a few rounds, brute force seems to be the only way to win the game. Once you have built a few key wonders and expanded your empire beyond 3-4 systems, the game becomes one of patience as the player waits to see his galaxy coverage slowly reach 51%.  Pros :   - Great Art for mission summarys. Might not be your cup of tea but I really like it.  - A full game session from start to finish can take from an hour to an hour and a half.  - Playing Starships unlocks new perks/loadouts and maps in Civ : Beyond Earth.  Cons :  - No option to play fullscreen. The settings menu makes it painfully clear that this is a port of a tablet game. For a company like 2k/Firaxis, this is inexcusable.  - Most of the textual descriptions and 'story elements' are nothing but flavor text.  - Diplomacy only serves to artificially lenghten the game.  - No customization; you cannot rename starships, planets or change the colors of your spaceships. Funny as this is one of the bullet points on the game's store page.  - The end game often occurs without player input. More than once I've won the game because the AI did something which triggered something else which gave me victory. No way of knowing what exactly happened.  - Sound guy annoyance : A capital ship explodes and the sound it emits is that of a single person screaming in agony. Rookie mistake.  To sum it up, the game feels unfinished, untested, unbalanced and unpolished. I have nothing against shorter games or games with more limited scopes (Ace Patrol was a great example of this) but this just feels rushed. There are many ways to better spend 15$.

            "review_text": "Very cool idea, very boring execution.  This feels like it was supposed to be 'Civ in space.' In reality, it's not even close. This isn't even Civ lite. The idea is cool. Instead of cities, you have planets. You send your eponymous starships on missions to help the residents of various planets in order to win them over to your side.  The glaring problems:  You get one fleet. The game is built around only having one fleet, so it kinda works. Just doesn't make any sense. Why would a space-faring civilization artificially limit themselves to a single fleet of eight warships? If this game didn't have Sid Meier's name on it, I wouldn't mention this. If it wasn't obviously meant to be viewed as 'Civ in space,' I wouldn't mention it. Want Civ in space? Go play the 'Final Frontier' mod from Civ 4's Beyond the Sword expansion.  Diplomacy is stupid. It's a ridiculously stripped-down version of the Diplomacy mechanics from Civ. You're always either at war or have a peace treaty with every other federation. If you're not at war, you can't move onto one of their planets. You must first declare war (using the diplomacy menue), then the move will be allowed. Here's the stupid part. Try this:  1. Declare war. 2. Conquer one planet belonging to enemy faction. 3. Move to second planet belonging to same enemy. 4. Accept bribe. 5. War is over. 'Enemy' will not attack you on their turn. 6. Repeat.  Battle AI is stupid. Enemy ships tend to stay in groups of at least two ships, making them very susceptible to torpedo attacks. Even if this wasn't the case, the AI hardly ever uses torpedos or stealth, making your opponents boringly easy to dominate.  Conquest is the entire game. There are apparently other victory conditions but I can't see why you'd pursue them, since this is a game about spaceships fighting each other for control of planets.  Battle tactics quickly become about filling the map with as many torpedos as possible to make sure you take out enemy ships without having to get lucky. You could certainly swarm the enemy with fighters instead, or pump the crap out of your plasma cannons and stealth units, getting in close for the kill. The point is: any 'tactic' you choose simply works. The AI provides no challenge whatsoever.  I'll admit that some of these things might be the result of me only playing on 'Normal' difficulty. I'm going to go try it again on hard but I'm not hopeful that I will meet a much greater challenge or that I won't be able to loop a war with one opposing faction at a time.",

            "review_text": "Very shallow and buggy. Crashes often on start or when winning. There's really just a hand full of different unit types, and realistically you ever have access to three of them. The integration with Beyond Earth is a neat idea, but it really adds nothing of real gameplay value. Some buffs, etc, but it doesn't make the game any more interesting, just easier, which it doesn't really need help being.   Diplomacy is limited, as is what you can do with planets, so there isn't really a diplomacy 'win'. Most planets have a wonder, which makes the 'culture' win objective really easy. Most of the objectives are rather easy now with how extremely streamlined this game is, with population being at 51% (you can pump up the population of your planets infinitely with city upgrades) and conquest being the regular old 'kill everyone', which is now by far the hardest objective to aim for what with population boosts from taking over enemy federations.  A lot of AI behaviors are locked off behind difficulty walls, so if you play normal or whatever you'll usually never see AI get aggressive enough to invade your homeworld. I kept digging looking for some sort of 'rare' encounter, planet, etc, but it seems like no matter the difficulty or size you'll probably see most of everything.  I've definitely played worse strategy games, but I feel like the Sid Meier name gets affixed to titles that tend to have some depth. I came in thinking this would be something like a 'Civ lite', but it's more like 'Civ barebones' with just the most basic of gameplay elements left to the Sid Meier name, almost to the point where it looks like a halfassed attempt to clone the Civ franchise.",

Frankly, it's a pretty poor effort at a mini-game spinoff of a stand-alone spinoff of a good game (Beyond Earth and Civilization V, respectively).  The real problem that I have with this game isn't the stripped-down options, the modest graphics, the periodically-uncotrollable game volume (I'm serious - have your hand on the volume when you win or you'll lose hearing), or the clunky and insipid AI. No, none of these broke the game for me. What broke the game is that when you capture an enemy capital you suddenly control the entire enemy empire. Ta da! It's like a game show bonus round worth more points than all of the previous game show rounds, making them a complete waste of time.  HOWEVER, if you really enjoy Civilization: Beyond Earth, Starships does have some really neat unlockable content for that game. The new goodies are two new maps and two new customization options each for starting ships, settler attributes, and cargo when you start a new Beyond Earth game. That alone was kind of a consolation prize as I worked through the achievements for Starships.  There's a catch, though. These games, although running through Steam, do not track each other's achievements through steam and require a 2k account (free, linked on the title page of Starships and Beyond Earth) for the games to 'talk to each other.' That is not at all clear and I only discovered it later as I tried to figure out how to get the Beyond Earth save achievement for Starships. The achivements are not awarded retroactively - I had all of the Beyond Earth achievements before I linked the games through 2k and so had no unlockables for Starships. Frustrating.  Unless you're a fan of Beyond Earth, pass on this one.",

I accidentally went to war, won a battle or 2 but was not quick enough to pull a 'suddent-death' population victory. It was that quick. Certainly not worth 14.99. I would have liked and expected something more indepth- social engineering, ship design options, a Federation-esque council, an interface that reflects my affinity, maybe even a full screen presentation. Yeah, the Civ series was never one to show awesome graphics in units. The tradition still carries on with Starships. The ship designs look more like sprites from an old 2000s or late 90s game. Eitherway, its not detrimental. Its just I would have expected to see more in that arena of a game with the title 'Starships'.   Like other Civ games, opponents are placed way too close to me. Most interesting was that I was placed in a corner in Starships. Where is the buffer- the exapnse of space/planets that allow me some peaceful expansionturns? I know this is a civ simulator, war is going to happen but I always wonder why the AIs are spaced out but I am placed right nextdoor to an AI.   Diplomacy and/or War Room screens, like BE, are paintings. Nice to look at but offer nothing in terms of universe immersion. I can overlook the short game, the bland UI or cartoony ship models. But I am tired of seeing paintings. Give me a reason to care about my people, show me videos for Wonders (What is the Dadaleus Ladder?), show me more background on the faction leaders- do something!

The unit is used in missions, which give influence with the various planets you visit; and when 4 points of influence are accrued, the planet in question will join your federation, giving you access to all it's resources.  There are several ways to win the game: domination, population (controlling 51% of the population of the galaxy), science, wonder (building 6 wonders). You can choose to have them all available, or just one.  There are a good number of leaders available, each with different skills, and with three different versions of each leader to choose from, allowing yet more customisation.  Despite all this the game feels a little unfinished and clunky, and is frankly in need of a decent tutorial level - as it can be a little confusing to start with. There's also no real warning when the AI's about to win, which would be nice - so something could be done about it, like in Civ 5.  All in all, I'd give this game 7/10 as once you get to grips with things it's a fun game. I'd like it to be longer, but you can't have everything. I consider it worth the money.

If I think about the first day I saw Starships announced, I was very enthusiastic about a space game made by the creators of Civilization. I couldn't wait until the day it comes out on Steam, checking every day the time left.  And then the time came, and I made the leap of faith to buy it and play it. What happened next not only puzzled me, it saddened me quite a bit.   The first time I launch a new game I always check the options menu to set up my audio and video settings. This time I couldn't find ANY graphic options and I started thinking of Starships like I would an unfinished/unpolished game. It felt like an Alpha version of a future game.  Nevertheless, I still wanted to see the game mechanics and what was in this game content wise.  A couple of clicks and choices later I was in a brand new universe managing a planet and 2 starships.   5 hours later and a few restarts I already finished the game on domination and I slapped my face because of the lack of a challenge behind the game. I'm not even inclined to open it another time for another game. :(  If you are looking for a quick, skirmish like, march of war style, starship game, this is the game for you, if not, don't bother.  My packet thoughts :  - over simplified options (every option included ! actions/buildings/research/ship modules/wonders/even the EPIC galaxy is tiny) - very stupid AI (shoot 5 torpedoes towards them and they will turn tail and run) - few research options and too easy to reach - lvl 8 capacity on every ship module (WHAT?!) - 8 maximum ships in a fleet ! - only 1 FLEET ! - very weak graphics  I hope with all my heart this is not a finished game. It had potential and it was a very, very, very bad failure!  Overall feeling for a PC game : 8 year old mentality  I think this game is much more suited for tablets or phones. Even those are more complex..... did you know they developed MMORPG's on tablets?!?!?!??  Please tell me your going to make massive changes to this game !",

            "review_text": "Kyu's Review for this game, Sid Meier's Starships:  Me: I play way too many games, almost all the time. I grew up on RPGs and turn based strategies, but I would play everything given the time and money. That being said, I mostly stick to strategy, rpgs, fps, arcade, rhythm, ccgs, lcgs, board games, fighting games, etc  I am going to tell you how I boiled the game down, and win relatively easily. I don't have a sample size of 100 games, but I am 3 for 3 on easy, moderate, and hard, with max players, small and epic sizes, all 3 affinities, etc. Impossible is the only mode i have yet to touch.  #1 strat: Fighters. The names may not be exact, but here is what you need:  Dual Command Wonder -- allows ships to perform 2 actions per turn (but cannot Fire twice) Hyperlauncher Wonder -- allows your fighters full movement when launched  Upgrade as you normally would, engines, armor, shields, primary weapon. Get more ships, 5 or 6 is a good strong fleet. Then, get 2 or more fighters on every ship.  Here is why 1 starfight is not good --&gt; If you turn is to move ships up, and launch a fighter from each, opponent can move up, and destroy them easily. So nothing is gained, your fighters are dead, effectively a waste of your energy on that upgrade, right?  However, with the Dual Command Wonder, you can launch two fighters. So even if half of them are destroyed, you are now up the other half on the enemy. If you have 4 fighters per ship, you can do that again next turn. The Swarm is an achievement, and its a very real thing. Make sure to science upgrade fighters 2 or 3 times for the random modules on them. Even on hard, I had Fighters that could take 2 or 3 hits from enemy ships. You can also use the Hyperlaunch to get a full move out of the fighters, and hit them, before they are destroyed, even if you dont have the dual command wonder. Dual Command Wonder also applies to your Fighters, though all they can do is double impulse, or fire+impulse.  The rest of 'how to win' is upgrade sensibly from the bottom up, find the cheapest thing, upgrade it first. Get the most for your money. BE SURE to get every planet a WARP NEXUS. This will allow you to be able to protect all of your planets from any of your other planets. You will be able to move between them without crew exhaustion.  A note on torpedoes, use them to Zone the enemy fleet. You can see where they will be in 2 turns, so aim for places you dont want the AI to move into. If they do, boom they die, if they dont, fine they are in worse position and you get to move in. Just watch out for their torpedoes, especially if they have stealth torpedo wonder.  So what will happen is, you do your turn, the AI does theirs, and if you have a strong fleet of Fighters and Warp Nexus upgardes everywhere, you can defend everything successfully, taking little to no fleet damage, meaning you dont need to repair or worry about attrition from battle to battle. New turn, go dominate someone. Survive the counterattack, and this continues until you finally win.  I will say that on Hard, the AI fleets were better upgraded significantly. They are more dangerous early on, so be a little wary.  All in all, a 1 thing beats all strategy means its not good gameplay balance. But... its just comp stomp i guess. So nobody can be too mad. For $15 you will get your value out of it, but it doesn't offer any super great planning or depth of thought. I was hoping there would be more to it, I thought you would be making separate fleets, possibly an actual tech tree, so on. I don't hate what is there, I just think it could have been a little better.",

Comparing it to other AAA titles is a bit unfair because it started as a $10 game and isn't much more than that. But it is fun, unique, clever and will give a few hours of gameplay.   But it doesn't have the 'one more turn' additiction of other strategy games.  Also, lasers and fighters are overpowered. :) Torpedoes are too, but harder to aim (except against easy AI).",

Don't expect too much, if you want to play deep and long games go to Civilization. If you want to relax after work for an hour or two this game could be for you.  What is Sid Meier's Starships? You have an intergalactic empire and the goal is nothing less than to rule the galaxy. You can build some basic industry on planets which produce resources like food, metal and so on. With those resources you build your fleet and travel to other planets where you can do missions to gather influence. If you have enough influence the sytem joins your empire. Very simple.  There are several mission types like 'kill all enemies', 'protect a convoy' or 'escape from a asteroid field'. You can customize your ships, which means you can add long range lasers, short range plasma weapons, torpedos, shields, hull, fighters etc. The fights are the fun part, with the different weapon types one can develop different tactics which makes really fun. The torpedos e.g. are good for a crowd of slow ships. Once fired they can't change direction but you decide when they explode. If the timing is perfect one explosion hits several ships and can even destroy them. Asteroids give you cover and the back of your ships are the most sensitiv part. I managed to destroy a big ship with two or three hits from my fighters in the back of the enemy.  The research is very basic, 9 (if I'm not wrong) different techs which can be upgraded some levels. The results are weapons with more damage, faster engines and so on. No new weapons or other ships.  You can build wonders, like in Civilization or Beyond Earth, but they do not cust so much. As far as I could see those wonders are powerful, one e.g. gives you clocked torpedos so the enemies don't see them anymore, which makes them even more powerful.  Sooner or later you meet the AI players, they want to rule the galaxy too. The diplomacy is very basic (not that its counterparts in Civilization or Beyond Earth are better in my opinion, but...) and is like 'hey, how are you, what have you done in the past, lets compare our genitals (fleet strengths, plantes, etc), do you want peace or war?'. Sooner or later one AI will declare war on you and you must try to conquer their planets. Or go straight to their home world and end their suffering.  The integration with Beyond Earth was promoted as a special feature. You need an extra 2K account for this (not sure if this hasn't been possible with Steam, but anyway). Then you are able to 'continue' a save game from Beyond Earth in Starships. Not sure what this means in detail. I managed to unlock some kind of bonus in Beyond Earth, but haven't played this again. I'm sure they extend this feature over time and it might add some replay bonus to both games. We'll see.  As I said at the top, don't expect too much. It costs only 15 bucks, I got it for 11 on GMG which is ok for the game. If you are unsure wait for a sale.",

It polished its core very well, you need to explore to expand, and you need to exterminate your rivals to make sure you end up with a controlling majority of the galaxy. You explore other player by playing off know rivals, for boost in you tech or resources.   I've only complete the one play through, and it took me roughly an hour. The controls took me about 15min to learn.   Comparing it to MoO2, combat is hex-bases rather than square based, and you take on the role of fleet commander. Very similar to each other, and it was nice.  The game is really basic, focusing on the core of what makes a 4X game, well, a 4X game, you can gain tech/recourses from fighting for a rival of a allied faction.

This is a great game to play on your ipad or machine when you have a couple of hours to burn and want to unwind after work. It is not a Civ game and will not have that level of cmplexity. I think it has potential to be very moddable if they make that an option.  Now with that said there are some things people need to know: The tech tree is very imited and has no appreciable effect outside of combat The game centers around space combat and gathering territory You can only have 8 ships and they always travel as a group It can feel a little rinse and repeat in the late game on Epic stick to shorter games  None of those things surprise me this is not a $50.00 game. What it does not have is any bugs I have found, it performs perfectly, and I have had fun playing it. I like space games, I like to unwind, I do not like to feel like I am managing an empire when I get off work during the week. This is exactly what I expected when I bought it, I watched a lot of game play videos from the creators before buying.  I suggest if you like science fiction and want something to play thats simple and fun. Give it a try, watch a few videos first if you are unsure.  If however, you are expecting the next Orions, Civ in Space, Galactic Civ or what have you then you will be dissapointed. It plays like a lightweight X-Com in space.

I have repeatedly seen the AI bring a fleet that should have had me struggling just to survive get crushed as it makes one moronic choice after another. Another thing I can't say I like is that so far every time I conquer a homeworld of a rival I inherit their entire empire. While that might work on a National lever (and I doubt even then), it seems a bit lame in this sort of game. It also makes achieving an outright win over a mighty rival possible in 1 combat. Wonders are fun, but get a powerful 1 early and your enemies are doomed.  Fun? Yes. Limited replayability? Also yes.",

Usually the AI wonder victories because it's the dumbest way to win when you are losing everything else. You CANNOT play a long game because of this. Either I win by turn 20ish by wonder or lose to the AI by wonder. The AI can hold 8 planets and win by wonder even when it can't win a single space battle. It's a stupid AI too it just sits at home planet and upgrades wonders when the victory condition is domination or science, AND IT STILL WINS WONDER VICTORY WITHOUT WONDER CONDITION SELECTED !!!

I beat it once on normal and never looked back. I wouldn't pay more than a deep sale price for it (66%+).  You get to take over planets, research tech, build a fleet, and fight other empires, but everything is very simple to the point of feeling limited.  You only get one fleet - yes that's right, one fleet total. The entirety of your combat and conquering happens with that one fleet. You have a 'fleet fatigue' counter which means you have to manage your turn to be as efficient as possible with your fleet.  Research techs have different names but come down to 9 categories that just 'level up', rather than some kind of tree with decisions to make about similar space drives with different advantages or anything like that.  There are 'wonder' type things that provide bonuses. Planets can have very simple buildings built to improve them.  Combat is turn based with a hex grid, and you get to make decisions on how you outfit your fleet (weapons/shields/etc take up space and add weight which require stronger weapons to move farther per turn).  Overall I felt like the decision making was fun and I especially enjoyed outfitting my fleet and planning out my turn movements. But it also was so simple that by the time I beat a game it felt like I'd seen everything I needed to see. I have 5.5 hours playtime total, but I did spend a couple scrapped games figuring things out so that's basically 1.5 games.  I'd recommend the game if you want a fun simple 4x that's almost mindless, or you like 4x but find them too complex with too much stuff to manage, or you want a simple intro to the genre (although Endless Space is a better intro imo).

I was able to defeat much larger forces where I was given a very unlikey chance of winning . But you can win the battle but lose the war which is what has been my fate so far .

If you've ever wanted just the turn-based tactical combat without the baggage of empire management, this is the game to get. If you've ever set up a Civ5 game on a huge epic pangaea with only elimination victory type, you might want to try Starships using epic + impossible + domination-only setup. You get the fun battles with much less empire management baggage and with much less possibility for lopsided technological mismatch.  And if you want turn-based combat in the form of starships in space, this may well be the only modern take in existence because I haven't managed to find any other. Most other 4X games have gone real-time with combat and they come with massive empire management and ship design overhead.  Here are a sample of things I liked compared to other tactical (mostly RPG) games:  - You can reconfigure your party instantly with little to no resource loss, promoting build diversity. You can refit your fleet into any spec to suit the next battle and respec it back. In most other tactics game, you're locked into particular builds accompanied by long grinding process which you have to repeat if you switch builds.  - The game gets going fast with minimal build-up time. Within 2-3 battles, you're already progressing up to considerable strategic options (e.g. cannons, fighters, new ship). In most other tactics games, you'd have to grind around for dozens of missions to gather resources and gain EXP.  - The galactic screen is essentially a very good mission chooser screen. Most other tactics games offer very little choice with regard to choosing missions. (e.g. limited to open sidequests, random battles that interrupt your travel, etc.) In Starships, you can look at your borders and choose a mission based on the other empire's strength and your crew fatigue. Mission types on non-federated planets are quite varied.  - Planetary Wonders are a really nice way to differentiate the strengths of each player in the game in a way that's halfway between randomized and controlled, and also in a way that you can't plan for from before the game starts the way you could with Civ5 leader traits or world wonders.  - No random chance to miss. (looking at you XCOM) Cover reduces damage instead of chance to hit.  The only real complaint I have for this game is the lack of multiplayer, although ultimately its addition would probably be no more than what multiplayer was in XCOM which didn't really do much.  Another possible complaint is that the AI is not terribly difficult, but I find that it only really has problems when you start using special tactics (like invisible torpedoes). In an open brawl, I find that the AI is quite competent with finding odd line of sight that I can't fire back to and are pretty good at finding a way to shoot your engines. The Impossible difficulty should be good for the vast majority of average players.  I like what the game has to offer in its current (and probably final) state and wholeheartedly recommend it for fans of turn-based tactical space games.",

It can get a little old after a while, simeply because there is no real depth to play.   The mission variety is low, and can really wear thin after long sessions.  In late game it can become a long slog between each faction going back and forth.  Very easy to lose on population when two factions join out of the blue. Several times I have gone from 49% population with an easy lead and then been overtaken by two factions, leaving me in the dust.  Bugs. You do find many, visual bugs mostly, animations looping, funky camera angles and windowing issues. All normally sort out with a quick save and restart so nothing game braking.   Overall I would reccomend if you fancy an every so often time sink.",
