            "review_text": "Very buggy, couldnt progress past 2nd level because the game would lock up. Upon defeating the boss in level 2, it would completely freeze at the screen that shows how many enemies you killed. I had to tab out and back into the game to get the option to exit. When i restarted the game a selected a different aircraft my movement keys would not respond...i dont feel like messing with it anymore...",
