    "description": "Combining its own unique take on the real-time roguelike genre, with a nostalgic 16-bit look and feel, Diehard Dungeon is a game that feels both familiar and quite different at the same time. Followed by a trusty, treasure collecting companion chest, you must make your way through the dungeons many randomly-generated rooms and levels.",

            "review_text": "Diehard Dungeon is a homage to the dungeon crawlers of old, mixed with some new, combined into a retro styled game that is not only aptly named but also a lot of fun to play.  Diehard Dungeon has you making your way though a series of dungeons, collecting gold keys and fighting various monsters and other enemies in an ultimate search for loot and glory. It has a surprisingly large amount of depth for a game with no story, and oddly enough, has a mini-game included that is almost worth the purchase price alone.  The game starts you off alone, in a dungeon with nothing. You quickly find your sword and a few stages later the Companion Chest. The Companion Chest stores your treasure (you never actually access it though) and will even help you fight your way through the dungeon. Upon your first boss battle you will also pick up a hand-cannon, which is literally, a handgun that shoots cannon balls. These make up your primary combat abilities in the game, with your sword being the focus ultimately. At the core, Diehard Dungeon is a hack and slash, but positioning yourself properly against certain foes is still important, as is proper use of the hand-cannon. As one might expect, with such a simple combat system the controls are also pretty simple.  Speaking of abilities, rather than leveling up and using experience points or any system like that; Diehard Dungeon simply has you find or win extra abilities. You can find them in chests that operate like slot machines, a mini “trap-door” game or just laying on the ground. These range from becoming fireproof, adding shrapnel to your hand-cannon or as suggested before, an ability that allows you to kill everything on screen in exchange for one heart of life by pressing B. These abilities are random and make all the difference in your ability to make it through the dungeon in one piece. This makes finding and collecting the abilities incredibly important, but also leads to one of the main downsides to the game.  While Diehard Dungeon is a blast to play, the name is very appropriate. The game uses a simple “heart” system of health, where each hit takes one away and you can add more (if you find some) along the way. That said, when you die, there is no check point; you don’t go back to the beginning of that dungeon room with all that you had when you got there; no, you go back, all the way back. To the beginning. With nothing. While this certainly makes death a big deal, it is frustrating when you seem to have a fairly decent start but then a really tough middle-range area in the game. Basically, if you get overwhelmed in a single room (which happened to me on a couple of occasions) you drop all of your progress from the last half hour and start over again; something made even more possible by the fact health can sometimes be quite rare. Does it add more weight to your death? Absolutely. Does it make you fight that much harder to not die? Of course. Does it make you absolutely want to stop playing the game for a few minutes after? You bet your ♥♥♥ it does.  Luckily the game does offer another mode of play to distract you for a bit while you let the anger inside you dissipate. The mini-game “Mayhem” is not only fun, it comes close to overshadowing the main game. Who would have guess that built within a dungeon crawler would be one of the better twin-stick shooters on the XBLIG service? Mayhem has you playing as the Companion Chest in a room that quickly fills with enemies. The goal is ultimately to get as high of a score as possible in only three minutes, but the “gimmick” is that your score multiplier only goes up if you don’t get hit. It is, simply put; a blast and you will strive to reach higher and higher on the leaderboard (I managed to take first place for an evening). The one downside to this mode is that quite often it seemed I was “being hit’ when there was no conceivable way that I actually was (unless the game punishes you for standing still). I was clearly not near any enemies (or crates) yet felt my controller vibrate like I was hit and saw that my multiplier had gone down as well. I’m assuming there was a reason for it that I just didn’t realize, but for the life of me I don’t know what it was.  Back to the main game, there is one other… issue that soured Diehard Dungeon’s experience. Despite playing through the game well (well? I kicked ♥♥♥) and killing everything in sight and breaking every crate open, I still made it to what I presume is the end of the game without enough golden keys to open the giant chest at the end; so I died and lost anyway. Looking at the developer’s website, “gold key rarity” is something that is planned to be patched in an updating coming any day now, so this is hopefully a non-issue going forward but it was incredibly frustrating to have gotten to the end and still lost because the game simply didn’t generate enough of a crucial item.  Death resetting everything is rough, but it is part of the game and what makes it work (even if you kind of hate it in the moment). A lack of a crucial item that makes an otherwise successful run a waste of time though is very, very close to being a deal breaker. Luckily for Diehard Dungeon, it was fun getting to that point and the mini-game Mayhem compensates for this oversight. Hopefully the patch will fix it, along with a lot of other changes coming soon as the patch is approved, but it is enough to take a great game and knock it down from where it should be; for now anyway.    Highly Recommended ",

            "review_text": "A decent addition to the 'fake roguelike' genre (a nice name for it might be rogue-like-like.) I would recommend it as it has most of the elements that fans of the genre like including permadeath, random upgrades, random dungeons, and a retro feel. The only problem that keeps me from loving this game is that it feels very slow, but only on the players end. The dungeons side on the other hand will seem very fast and can kill you in just seconds with the crazy amount of enemies on the screen (which is no problem at all of course.) The issue is that killing the enemies seems so slow sometimes with your cannon gun and tiny little dagger. Yes, you can upgrade both of those, but sometimes you wont get upgrades through out the dungeon if you are unlucky and it will just make things slower. One may argue 'that's what rogue-likes are all about. They are going to be tough.' This isn't really that kind of game. In this sort of game you want quick difficult gameplay where the upgrades make you feel like you are progressing even if the game is getting more tough. A few floors in and i'm doing the same damage. The only buffs I have make me immune to fire or that the chests wont be empty (yet you can still get unlucky and recieve nothing.) The game is fun. Just seems slow. I think it's safe to say that if you know what you are playing 5 dollars is a good price.   LET IT BE KNOWN THAT THE UPDATE THAT MAKES YOUR SWORD SLASH WAS A GREAT IMPROVMENT. IT IS A LOT MORE PLAYABLE FOR NOW. THE GAMEPLAY FEELNIG A BIT SLOW AS SAID IN THIS REVIEW STILL APPLIES A LITTLE BIT, BUT IT IS NOW ON THE RIGHT TRACK. CAPS LOCK YES.",

Part of me wishes items rolled over to your next death as they can be difficult to aquire right away, but the fact that they don't increases the difficulty a bit.

You've got a choppy chop sword and a kind of crappy gun and with the right powerups the gun is less crap and the sword is more choppy. That's pretty much all there is to this.  It's not complicated, it doesn't have much staying power, but it's ok for a lark. Solid 6/10.",

It has steam cards and if you sell those on the market this game is less than 4 bucks for hours of entertainment.   There is a mayhem mode which is basically a twin stick shooter where you compare scores on a leaderboard with your friends and other gamers world wide. Nothing spectacular but again...the game is $4.  Gameplay wise it doesn't get old until a few hours in. This is a rogue-like so it's one of those where after 1 death, you start over from the very beginning. You will lose health is some really cheap ways too. I found myself getting frustrated from the cheap deaths on more than one occasion but thats when you just boot up a differant game and come back later.",

            "review_text": "Sorry, I just found this to be boring as heck.  TL;DR: You run around repetitive, boring rooms, killing repetitive, boring monsters, with repetitive, boring weapons.   Graphics are '16 bit', but they are just dull and uninspired. Rooms all the same. Enemies are boring. Graphics that would have been dull in the 16 bit era. Secret of Mana this ain't.  You collect gold but what does it do? There's no shop.  You collect rings or something. But what do they do? They don't seem to do anything.  You've got a treasure chest that follows you around - and it can level up - but what's it do? What's the level up do? What's the point of the chest, except being able to hide in if you get a rare lucky roll? The chest seems like it's central to game's uniqueness, but it doesn't seem to do anything.  I beat the boss - but he was the same as an enemy I had already fought several times before, all he does is run at you, and then I went to the next set of levels - which was more or less just like the last set, except a bit harder.  Every time you die, you lose all the stuff you've been collecting, and it never seems to help you or do anything in any way.  All in all, I didn't want to get better at this game, I didn't want to explore to see what else the game had to offer, I didn't want to beat it - because everything about it was boring as spit.  I'm not sure what I paid for this, but whatever it was it was too much, because I've gotten vastly more enjoyment out of free flash games.  Sorry.",

A shy guy from Mario. A mimick. Meh! The only advantage they have over you, the only way they ever damaged me, was with teleporting or simply because they were running faster than me. Lame.  3. The items and power-ups suck. Your sword reaches a quarter of an inch and your gun shoots blueberries instead of, y'know, bullets. So your projectiles bounce off everything and rarely connect for full damage. The power-ups include lame things like status immunities, larger health pools, and the ability to run faster. Where's all my exotic weapons? Damage shields? Dashing? ANYTHING fun?  4. Many enemies either run from you, slow you down, or are faster than you-- making every single one tedious.  5. Crates can contain explosives and/or enemies that hit you as soon as they pop out. Chance rules over skill.     TDLR:  I know this is a rogue-like, but the power-ups and enemies are dumb. The setting/dungeon is UGLY. The difficulty is artificial, where chance rules over skill.",

A treasure chest 'companion' levels up (and it caps out fairly quickly) although not to much effect. Itemization is similarly lacking: you have a sword and a gun and... that's it. They don't upgrade. There are 'perk' cards you can find although I only manged to stumble on one in about an hour of gameplay and you are limited to two total.

Though there is one problem I have with this game... The cannon, it feels like I'm going to use that instead of the sword as it's long ranged and I have a higher chance of not getting stabbed in the face. Also I love how the game lets you choose your path of where to go and progress through each level. You can do a diehard level or just a regular one, but you wanna be a badass then go diehard.
