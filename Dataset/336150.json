Overall, the best Pool Simulation for decades, it can only get better with graphics overhaul, and better net play compared to Virtual Pool 3 (not the Steam version) which uses GameSpy.  Too bad that Celeris don't implement SteamWorks multiplayer and implementing credits/real cash investment for multiplayer.  It is understandable tho, since VP is their only IP and they're doing their best to polish it on every releases. This is the only way to keep the dev team fed.  So keep it up, Celeris!",

I've put in a few hours on this today and I'm really liking it. still wish there was a way to speed up the gameplay when the AI was shooting (I know about 'zip' but still have to wait until my opponent shoots)",

Only downfall I have with this game is , I bought this game to play at work. I did not realize I had to be connected to internet to play this game....having said that I can still recommend it to those who play with internet connection.",

            "review_text": "Having played pool in competition for a few years my opinion about this game might be a bit focused on the sport itself, more so than the gameplay element. The simulation aspect is very good and indeed I have great fun playing a few matches every day, just because in heart I am still somewhat of a pool addict. The gameplay elements however might be a bit lacking for someone looking for more of a in-depth game, rather than just playing pool. Careers for example are essentially just a large number of matches, without much variation. The different tables (size and cloth) are nice tough. I haven't touched the multi-player and I believe the online part would require a few euro/dollar per year subscription after the first year. Don't get me wrong, I get much enjoyment from playing the careers in pool and snooker (speaking of snooker, the simulation is very good). If you're hoping for an action packed experience with intense and sophisticated career development, you might get bored after a while. If you just want to play some pool without leaving your house/chair then I can wholeheartedly recommend this product.",

The game engine is very dated, it uses the same engine as its former counterpart VP3 released more than 15 (yes fifteen) years ago. very poor outdated GUI interface, and a very, very poor online profiling system which has NO PRIVACY options, so beware. have now uninstalled the product, and will expect a full refund for a lower than mediocre product.",
