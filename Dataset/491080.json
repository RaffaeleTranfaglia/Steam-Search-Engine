            "review_text": "   tl;dr: All the spam-clicking of an idle game without the satisfaction.   BoneBone is a simple game. Waves of skeletons will approach your castle, gradually increasing in duration and enemy toughness. Your job is to click to fire arrows from your bow and prevent them from breaching your defenses. There's not much to the game besides spamming arrows. You can purchase two additional weapons but their cost and slow reload times make them inadequate for general use. You can hire archers and gunners for your tower and upgrade its health. That covers all the upgrades this game has to offer.  My main gripe with this game and the reason I have given it a negative review is that the developer has destroyed any replay value it might have by failing to include a wave select option. I made it to wave 20 (which was more tedious than it was fun) at which point a catapult-manning skeleton showed up with no warning whatsoever and blew my tower to pieces. I would like the option to choose to start from wave 5, 10, 15, or 20 with either the upgrades and money I had at those times or better yet, with no upgrades and the average amount of money players would have earned by that time, free to spend on different upgrades to see what works.  This is a feature I would expect from other games of this type. I'm not wasting half an hour every time I lose at wave 20 just to get back to where I was and possibly get wrecked again. Additionally, this game could be a lot less repetitive. I understand it's only $2 but Steam shouldn't be a place for newbie developers to dump MyFirstGame.exe. Add some new upgrades...a campaign...anything.",

This should deff not be on steam for the lack of content and how boring it is. After 20mins the game does get harder and harder but if you buy the right stuff you should be good.  Pros Have to lead your shot when shooting Steam achievements and trading cards gets challening as you progress  Cons Lack of different kind of skeletons Needs different kind of defense upgrades ",
