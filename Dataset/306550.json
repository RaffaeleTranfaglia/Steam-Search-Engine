            "review_text": "Runers is a top-down, may-as-well-be-twin-stick shooter with roguelike qualities, including permadeath. Contrary to what you might have expected after glancing at the screenshots, the game does  not  feature traditional loot, consumables, equipment or an inventory system, other than what’s required to craft spells. With this in mind, I didn’t expect it to have much depth but was pleasantly surprised to be proven at least partly wrong.  The main attraction here is the magic system that lets you combine a catalyst with one to three runes from eight elements to create 285 different spells. Most results are unique in both animation and effect and generally fall under buff, debuff, direct single-target damage, area of effect, or some combination thereof. Spells can be further upgraded in power by dragging duplicate runes of the same element onto them, which augments their damage, knockback, cooldown, bullet size and speed. Runes, and the catalysts needed to combine them, drop from enemies and destructibles and are presented as a reward option when descending floors.  Spell quick slots are limited, maxing out at six after you’ve beaten a few minibosses, and excess spells must be in one of two storage slots or discarded. Two primary spells can be set to autofire so that they blast toward your cursor each time the cooldowns are up, which really makes casting feel like a twin-stick shooter without actual twin-stick support. Spell quality varies wildly with a few feeling overpowered, many feeling useless, and most falling somewhere in between. Casting does not consume resources and is only limited by cooldowns, so it’s fun to experiment with different builds.  Adventuring begins with choosing a difficulty, a racial passive ability, a class that determines your activatable special ability, and a starter spell (or, in roguelike fashion, just hit “random” and let the game decide these things for you). After this, you’ll be placed in a ten-floor dungeon with a toggleable map overlay that shows which rooms you’ve visited and any items you’ve left behind.  Enemies often feel just as, if not more, powerful than you because they cast the same spells available to you and can quickly fill your debuff bar. Combat involves a lot of running in circles as a result, dodging projectiles like you’re in bullet hell while slinging your own spells toward the pack of enemies that’s chasing you. Emerging as the victor will unlock the exits in that room and let you progress to the next. Rinse and repeat. The bulk of Runers’ depth and imagination went into its magic system and there isn’t much in the way of surprises outside of that. There are really only three room variants in the game: rooms containing a throng of enemies, a boss or miniboss, or a challenge (which is often just another throng of enemies whose conditional defeat rewards you with a perk).  Upon leveling up or completing a challenge room, you get to choose between four perks that are drawn randomly from a huge pool. With a few exceptions, these bonuses are more about augmenting your spells to be as deadly as possible and less about traditional character stat building. Even though death is permanent, a runedex keeps track of all the spell combinations you’ve unlocked thus far and a bestiary does the same for all the enemies you’ve encountered. There are also leaderboards for each difficulty and 30 optional, standalone challenges.  As long as you delve into Runers with an open mind and no expectations of it cleanly fitting into a particular genre—and you’re prepared to deal with the difficulty of projectile hell—you should enjoy the ride.",

            "review_text": "Runers is an amazing combination of discovery and rogue-like gameplay. You use 1-3 of 10 different types of runes to create hundreds of spells. Of the 285 spells you can only discover a handful per run, and runs can take hours. In other words, this game's element of discovery can last hundreds of hours.   The spells are incredibly unique and versatile. You'll find that they fit into general categories and serve similar purposes, but that no two spells are the same. You can also upgrade the spells you have created by using additional runes on them. This doesn't simply upgrade damage or cooldown time though, but any of a number of aspects of a spell including but not limited to: buff duration, radius, force, speed, knockback, stun duration, and even 'leash elastic.' Clearly not all spells will have every one of these and more aspects, but how a spell can be upgraded is just as important as how it first appears.  For me the best thing about this game is that it is a rogue-like with meaningful general progression. Usually in rogue-likes, once you die you start over and very little will have changed other than your knowledge of the game. In this game you might discover a very useful spell on one run and feel great about your progress even without winning or performing well.  A really important thing to understand about the mechanics of this game is the meaning of 'discovery.' Creating a spell for the first time does not simply mean adding a new 'recipe' to your runedex that you could have just looked up on a wiki. You need combiners to create spells for the first time, afterwards you can create those spells using only the required runes. Combiners have another possible use though, in that you can break them to gain experience. I can't stress enough how important it is to be aware of this aspect of the gameplay. If you look through the discussions you will find many, many people who didn't become aware of this until they had put many hours into the game.  I definitely plan on completing my runedex so there's no way I couldn't recommend this game.  I should also add that this game has a pretty cool soundtrack.",

            "review_text": "Runers is a great game for folks who want a challenge and a multitude of strategies to defeat it. My recommendation to first-timers is to do the tutorials once before you start, then again after a few hours of gameplay. You'll be grateful you did since coming up with your own winning build requires a good understanding of the mechanics, the more advanced of which are best learned once you have a good understanding of the basics. The game is challenging, both in gameplay and in build-creation.  Here's a quick example of the diversity of the game. There are 285 possible spells, of which I have discovered just under 100, and already I have 3 or 4 high-powered builds that are capable of winning (at least on the easier difficulties). Throughout the game, you will complement these skill-builds with a set of unique abilities you acquire from accomplishing various in-game feats (e.g. completing a floor, defeating a boss, succeeding at an 'event room', leveling up). You can base the abilities your spells or your spells off your abilities, but certainly you will want to think about how they will pair with each other to make your character perform best.  As far as the enemies, I haven't counted, but I would say there are well over a hundred unique types. Developing a strategy on how to approach each enemy type is another critical part of succeeding. The game is not easy to win, even on the 'easy' difficulties, so be prepared for a challenge. Once you get to know the majority of the mob types, you will find yourself laughing in the face of enemies that you used to curse for their ridiculous difficulty! Except for bosses... Boss fights are just as diverse as the 'normal' room fights, with what seems to be at least a few dozen different bosses that you can encounter. These will range from 'Oh, I can easily beat this guy when he does such-and-such' to 'I'll never beat this guy!' (don't worry, you can definitely beat him, the question is are you resourceful enough). All of them are distinctly different experiences which is what kept me coming back to replay it again and again.  As far as the different difficulties, well, I haven't beaten it above the first two difficulty levels, but that is mostly because I've only tried the harder ones a couple of times at this point (the game is pretty new, after all). As I said before, even the 'Wimpy' mode presents a challenge and I would recommend sticking to this mode until you've honed your skills and developed several effective combos that you can be prepared to deploy. You have to be ready to be effective regardless of what rune types start dropping from the enemies you dispatch.  All in all, this is a pretty stellar game. I quickly grow weary of a game that either feeds me an easy win or sits me in a rail-car and doesn't let me deviate or forge my own chosen path to victory. Runers does neither of these things, and is winnable with literally thousands of different builds/strategies. And just when you think you're a master, you realize you're playing on 'Wimpy' and it's time to up the ante and break into the higher difficulties.  Runers has been fun so far and hopefully some of the remaining spells I discover will give me the edge I need to beat it on Apocalypse. Rune ho!",

            "review_text": "On first sight I thought this would be an interesting game. Sure enough it has an interesting concept, however the implimentation of it doesn't seem very successfull. You will find that most spells you discover are just plain useless either because they are too weak or don't make sense against the AI. Another big problem is that you depend on using 5 different spells at the same time. This itself is not a problem, but I really couldn't enjoy it since there isn't a comfortable control 'layout'. I ended up having to bind 2 spell hotkeys to different buttons on my mouse and using 1 hotkey on the keyboard for spells with long cooldown. The bossfights seem to be pretty nice, I can't say this for all of them since I only did the first 3 before I stopped playing the game, but I got to say that they were enjoyable and unique. All in all I would not recommend this game, simply because it feels unpolished and not comfortable to play.",

            "review_text": "Runers is a more or less classical Rogue-like game, unlike most rogue-like/lite games it is NOT fun.  The basic idea of the game is that you are a wizard and you can make spells from runes that you randomly find, get as a reward or that are dropped by enemies. However you need double-combiners to make spells with 2 runes and extremly rare triple-combiners to make spells with 3 runes. In about 30 minutes of gameplay you can on average get about 1 triple combiner, and 3-5 double-combiners. The game has 285 spells and unlocking all the spells takes forever - also in your first runs before you unlocked some good spells you can't get very far. If you want to try to enjoy this game you NEED to use a wiki and look up the powerful spells because 80% of the spells are completly useless. I didn't use a wiki and eventually i called this game 'disappointment simulator' as a joke but it really isn't far off.  Another problem is that is constantly crashes, in my 15 hours with the game it crashed at least 10 times, the developer also hasn't updated this game in over a year other than a language patch - so it will most likely never get fixed.  The combination of a grindy game with lots of disappointing spells and constant crashes makes this game terrible and you should avoid this game even if you are a fan of rogue-likes.",

            "review_text": "My first review, and unfortunately not a positive one.  Runers is one of those games that has great ideas, but lacks in implementation and utilization of those ideas (and in my opinion, aesthetics). Like most rogue-like games the game thrives initially on exploration, in this case the collection of runes, enemies and different status-elements that can be found through casts and rooms. Unfortunately, almost all of these 3 mechanics seems kinda lost in this game.  Lets start off with the collection of runes and the alchemy-style combination of different runes. The idea is clever and could be interesting and rewarding if the spells are unique and rewarding. Unfortunately, this isn’t the case. Yes, almost every spell and combination is different, but most casts lacks uniqueness and character and sometimes seem to dull. Most casts differ in color, different animation, different damage modifier, and sometimes in tactics ♥♥♥ well, but mostly I don’t get the idea having created a great spell which impacts my progression (I guess this has a lot to do with my dislike to the aesthetics of the game). Eventually, when most spells are discovered there isn’t much going for the game because its lack of unique elements.  Secondly, most enemies seem to be dully animated moving sprites. Specially the bigger enemies, which seem to be a scaled version of the smaller ones without any additions or anything (some of these enemies are really poor scaled, like the big rat/guinea pig, where you can see the resolution is equally to the smaller one and see the pixels of the sprites. Guys, this is really poor work!).  The status effects doesn’t seem to change the gameplay a lot. To be honest, I haven’t played the game long enough to really experience this though, but what I’ve noticed didn’t really impress me.  Again, this goes all pretty much with my dislike for the aesthetic of the game. The graphics, animations, music and gameplay feels like a flash-game or run-of-the-mill dungeon crawler created by some guy in late 90’s at game maker because it's his first 'real game'. Most of all, it lacks in a lot of ways.  2/10",
