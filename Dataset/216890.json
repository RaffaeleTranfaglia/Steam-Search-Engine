            "review_text": "I had the legendary edition previously and was holding out for BloodBowl 2. I was disappointed with what i saw and even more disappointed with the wave upon wave of issues Blood Bowl 2 has.   At 75% off I was convinced that I might as well finally opt for Chaos edition as I had always wanted to play chaos dwarfs anyway. Initially I was put off by 'made-up' new teams but the Khorne and Underworld teams add some variety that remains balanced in line with others.   Rest of the additions is simply more of what we had before.....  If you want to get into Blood Bowl then by far your best option is to ignore 2 and get Chaos edition of Blood Bowl 1. If you have either of other versions of Blood Bowl 1, then stick with what you've got unless you REALLY want to play one of the 3 new teams.  I loved Blood Bowl on tabletop and this version of the game is the best available! Highly recommended!",

            "review_text": "Rather than going for an re-interpretation of the Warhammer table-top game (Dawn of War), this game takes the Warhammer Fantasy football game 'Blood Bowl' and ports it perfectly onto PC. The game itself plays a lot like chess, with a turn based system in which one team attempts to score as many goals as possible (as you'd expect). The difference between Blood Bowl and an ordinary game of football, however, lies in the fact you can maim, bribe and murder the other team if you so desire, making for some intersting matches to say the least. The selection of teams is diverse, with each having their unique feel and playstyle instead of just being re-skins of the same team. If you're considering getting into the tabletop version, I most certainly recommend playing this first as it can teach you the basics of the game and is incredibly fun to play with friends.  Don't enable the real-time option if you value your sanity.",

The underlying mechanics are great, and Chaos Edition was, even with the release of BB2, the definitive edition of the game.  Keyword was. With the release of BB2 we saw a slow downward spiral of the MP community, to the point where today, the only action going on in BB1, either CE or Legendary, is in scheduled organized leagues. As such I cannot reccomend BB1 to a new player. BB2 may be a steep ask what with the lesser amount of teams, but it's where most of the pickup MP community has gone. There also is the freeware alternative called FUMBBL, that's 2d and java based. Both are a far better option than BB1 now for actual MP.  Ordinarily I would not go an remove and change the thumb to a down for a game simply because of the MP community drying up, but for Blood Bowl the entirety of the game is both MP, and has moved on to a nearly identical platform as well at that, and thus I feel obliged to steer people to those two alternatives, either the updated retail version, or the smaller, more hardcore community of the freeware game.",

This is the edition that has everything and I heartily recommend it.  If you do play it, I recommend reading the rulebook (just google blood bowl rulebook). Although the game generally works very well, it's much more enjoyable when you sit yourself down to the actual rules. It's a little bit of work, but these rules were honed through years of playtesting and active experience and what has come out makes sure that every game is exciting, unpredictable and challenging. Above all it's a game that teaches one to learn to deal with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ situations you can be put in or marvel at the gutsy gambles that have paid off.  Not recommended for people that dislike chance as a whole; you can minimize the risk to a great amount and the winner of league is generally the better player, but the winner of a match is sometimes decided by the dice gods.  My very first game my most expensive player was hit and killed by a rock thrown by the audience; before I had even made a single decision. If that kind of thing sounds like fun, this game might be for you.",

I have no problem with RNG in games in fact I love that aspect, however, this is not the case here. Yet again alot of fanboys and other will continuiously state that it is not rigged, that people just dont understand the brutality of RNG and statistics. but, I do thats the problem, and thats why I know that the game is rigged. In conclusion I would rate this game a 2 out of 10, some people may like the way the game AI cheats, but I think most casual gamers playing on easy just want to enjoy their experience when playing. If I wanted unfair and imbalanced AI I would play on hard setting, Overall, I got this game on sale for 75% off so you would think I cant really complain... but I just got my refund. So if your going to spend any money at all on this title I would suggest doing some research first. You will find I'm not alone in my review. Ok fanboys, let me have it now, you know you all can't contain your bias.   Overall rating 2 out of 10 main issue being rigged gameplay on single play mode  no casual settings just easy=hard normal=real hard and hard=brutal   ALSO BEWARE FANBOY BIAS, (they can't help themselves)",

The dice has a very high chance in failing you in this game. It fails your AI or human opponent as well. So its fair in that sense.

Based off the original board game, Blood Bowl is an American Football game mixed with chess-like strategy. You'll position players, throw blocks, and hopefully score touchdowns. Graphically BB doesn't offer much, you have a handful of stadiums and some customizable players, but where Blood Bowl really shines is its diverse character roster. 23 races fill BB stadiums, from the sleek Amazons, to the toughened Orcs, to the completely useless Halfling teams, each race works differently, and it's up to you to find which one fits your play style. For those who love destroying the enemy team, the minotaur teams of Chaos are for you, boasting strong players to help maim as many players as possible. Want to go around them, Skaven will do just fine. Wanna launch a hail mary, High Elf. However, keep in mind that each team has conflicting weakness that you must tailor your strategy to.  BB plays out kind of like chess and American Football wrapped in one. Two teams battle it out over 16 turns to score as many touchdowns as possible. This is where things get interesting. It takes a whle to get used to the rules and understand how everything works, but stick it out and you'll see the beauty. You'll see all kinds of strategies, like the typical punch everything style of Orcs to the outrageous physical game with Skaven, and you have to tailor your plan accordingly. Keep in mind that all the mechanics are dice based, like the original board game, so even though you baited the team and are set to make a perfect hand off, Nuffle (the BB God of the Dice) may say 'Nope!' and have him drop the ball, so no strategy is fool proof. When your not beating people/getting beaten sensless, you're buying players, leveling up players, and hiring cheerleaders and coaches. Blood Bowl's skill system is a lttle weird, having you roll dice. If you roll singles, you get to choose from a select few. Singles over a certain amount allow you to boost one of their skills. Doubles lets pick any skill or, if allowed, mutate, which gives you special abilities for certain races AND changes the corresponding character model, so expect to see a few Chaos Beastmen with tentacles, claws, or an extra head or arm.  The Verdict: +Fun Customization +Strategies for each race +23 races -Dice based combat system  8/10 Great  If you can get past the rules, find the right team, and accept that a few bad rolls are going to happen, then I sincerely recommend buy Blood Bowl.",
