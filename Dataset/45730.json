Third-party DRM on top of Steam AND a 5-machine-activation restriction, to this day I have yet to play the game, because it simply won't go past the CD Key activation screen. It returns an 'invalid' error. The product is nothing short of broken and the 5-machine-restriction is a major publisher practically begging its audience to stay away from its own product.   Do not buy, despite the low price-tag, unless you feel adventurous enough to deal with its technical baggage on the customer.  PS: I would like a refund, Capcom. Otherwise, we're done.",

For me this was a title that looked and sounded better in promos and reviews than it actually ended up being. The controls were not as intuitive as they could have been considering the type of gameplay involved.  The audio failed to impress either to be honest.  The gameplay became stale very quickly too, and I can't really place my finger on the exact reason for that. Perhaps it was the difficulty level, or some combination of the above. I just know that I lost interest in a very short amount of time with the presentation as a whole.  Usually I am a fan of these types of retro styled games but this one just didn't do much for me.",

Dark Void Zero is all that was great in those games, and yes, that includes the difficulty and all the frustrations of trying to clear the game! The music alone is a massive dose of nostalgia, gameplay is reminiscent of Contra or... well... I forgot. It has been a while since then!

Don't let me get started about the atrocious platforming mechanics either.  Do not make the mistake I made and do NOT buy this game.",

It lasted for the moment when I tried to find it on some NES related websites and found nothing. What does that mean? Dark Void Zero have an amazing atmosphere and while playing, it really feels like old game. It bring so many good memories, when platformer games were simply and fun. It's not a long game, have only 3 levels and 3 boss fights, and if you are not begginer when it comes to this genre, you can complete this game in 1 hour. Is it hard? At first, on hard difficult level, but once you learn how to deal with enemies and boss, it will be piece of cake. I guess that's most fun thing in such a games. I can recommend this game to every platformer games fan, it's a great game.  ABOUT SecuROM DRM - not only the activation limit was raised up to 20 times, but you can also revoke activation limit in this game, check the guide in community hub. Still, it sucks that game which already have a DRM (Steam) are using another one, just to make lifes of us, gamers, harder.",
