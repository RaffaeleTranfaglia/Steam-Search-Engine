Now that I finally get to play it again, it was a very worthwhile purchase and worth the wait. There's a lot to love here, whether you're in it for the speedrun or for the item collection or a little bit of both. This is a fun physics game that anyone can get into.",

            "review_text": "Disclaimer: I personally know a member of the dev team  Magnetic By Nature is an enchanting yet difficult game. The art style is simple and beautiful and the music is atmospheric. The gameplay does take a little bit to get used to but is very fun. I've finished the main 4 zones, and have yet to pass the first level of zone 5. It is a bonus zone for a reason, zone 5 is HARD. I like how they've added 'collectibles' to, well, collect. Usually trying to get them increases the difficulty of the level.  There are bugs: -getting stuck in the floor or wall unable to move forcing you to restart level. This doesn't happen often but is annoying. From what I understand from the dev team it would require re-coding from the ground up to fix, and it rarely happens anyway. -UPDATE (this has been fixed!) PC version showing Xbox controls.  This game also lacks the ability to remap keys. I have trouble with my mouse hand after an injury which made the default layout difficult. I solved this by downloading Key Remapper and rebinding Lctrl and space to simulate L and R mouse buttons enabling me to play one-handed.  Overall I'll give this game a solid 4/5. I'm glad I bought it, and likely will play it here and there for years to come.",
