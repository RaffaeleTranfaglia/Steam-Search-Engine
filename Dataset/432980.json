            "review_text": "Menus are great and aesthetically pleasing.  Music fits the game wonderfully.  Gameplay is simple but can get deep and engaging.  The single player and multiplayer are both very fun, online needs more players so far (day one).   The game maker's vision is clear, and the game feels complete.   Flaws:  - Game may need to be restarted when plugging a controller in after the game is already running (happened once with an xbone controller not showing in the available controller list) - Slow matchmaking. I never got into a match after 5 minutes, but the game just came out and my guess is there just wasn't anyone playing online at the time. Hopefully this improves with time.  I absolutely recommend picking up this game if you like arcade multiplayer games. It's a game I'm going to enjoy playing with my friends for quite a while.  ",

They managed to make the single player REALLY enjoyable for high score chasers like myself cant wait to dive back in. I also got to dive into some multiplayer which i was really excited for. Someone named Gongon poped into my game and we went back and forth at it for about an hour stright !!! keep in mind matches last what, maybe 2 minutes or so ? so you can do the math how many matches we played ! You can tell after a while we were both playing mind games and trying different strats on each other, what a blast.   You can pretty much see what your getting yourself into this game in the trailer so ill tell you a thing or two that you CANT SEE. There is actually a good amount of strat. that goes into VS. people in this game. From Board Managment (controlling a specific part on the board or just trying to control the powerful/fast Red Bullet pick ups) or the Bullet managment (When to shoot or try and counter what the opponent is going for, when to use a charge shot as opposed to some quick fast shots) Cant wait to dive back in =)",
