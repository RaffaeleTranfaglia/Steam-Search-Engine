            "review_text": "   Fun little Time-water   I remember playing the original 7 Wonders game and several of the follow ups in the past. I can't remember where I played them, but I do remember the art style, and building the 'Wonders'. So, let's get into it here...   Pros:  -Game is exactly what it is advertised as: A   Casual   Match 3 Puzzle game. (And by Casual, I mean VERY Casual...) -Nice music -Nice graphics -Runs smoothly on a toaster, or a potato, or a turnip... would run well on a mobile device (which is what it seems best suited for...) -Workers are still as cute and annoying as always, annoying enough to be cute or vice versa -Board rotation (allowed constantly w/o needing to earn it), and needing to move a special piece through a set path, to lock it into a specified location to finish each level is different from many Match 3 games, so a few twists on the standard. -EASY, with a very generous timer and power ups (This is both good and bad... good if you want very casual and easy...)   Cons:  -EASY, possibly TOO easy for anyone looking for a challenge. Timer allows far too much time to really ever feel any imperative to make matches quickly, power ups are almost too easy to get and too plentiful. Totally subjective. - Price - I got a key for free, so I can't complain. But I would NOT recommend this game at full price ($10 USD is way too much), would not recommend unless you get it for 75% off or more.  Game has replayability to a degree, since it does rely on random placement of the tiles you have to match. I have played for a few hours, 15 minutes at a time. I could keep playing this as a pure, casual, relaxed time waster. But it is at the bottom of my list if I want a challenge tbh.  Fun little game, but don't get this thinking it is as 'difficult' as earlier versions of the game, The frustration and challenge were removed in this version. That said, it would be a great game for kids, because the satisfaction of completing levels and successfully building a Wonder are almost guaranteed. But a possible disappointment to fans of earlier versions of the game.  6/10 Overall Would buy at 75% off or better, would never buy at full price of $9.99 USD",
