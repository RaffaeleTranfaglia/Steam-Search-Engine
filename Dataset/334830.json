Playing through it you can tell it is heavily influenced by Portal and Braid, and possibly other puzzle games. I really enjoyed the puzzle aspect of this game, however I give it a cautious recommendation as it suffers from some presentation and pacing issues.   Thoughts, game play wise:",

It has some really interesting ways of experimenting with gravity to create puzzles. Most of the time I really enjoyed the game. The only thing, I do not like so much, is the controls. Moving the balls around sometimes feels a bit random and slugish, which means that I had to try a while for solving a puzzle, even though I knew how to solve it in theory, just because the balls would fly off. Fortunately in most cases this can be fixed quickly by going back in time.  Overall a nice puzzle game :)",
