            "review_text": "So here's my review after finishing (a branch of) this VN after 34 minutes, with an abrupt end literally saying 'loading diskette B. Fatal error.' and then dumps you in the main menu. Guess this game is grossly unfinished?  From what I read there are some interesting plot points put up. What happened to the world. Why is the moon so important, why did the night go away, what mysterious work does the player do, who are the people behind the mysterious message, is the player going crazy or is there really something strange going on with his surroundings? But as stated, it disruptly ends everything, telling you just go make a few other choices. If all are as unfinished as mine, I don't see the point really.  Now that we've got the good stuff out of the way let's go to the bad. Which there is a lot of. The most grievous and harming has to be the absolutely broken translation. While the overall story sounds interesting the text itself is barely readable in most cases. Then there are the graphics, SFX and music, which are all really bad. REALLY bad. Add ontop of that a protagonist which doesn't seem to be clearly defined (he heavily hammers on being a loner, then there's a whole section where he asks people to actually visit him). And as stated the story being unfinished leading literally nowhere being all questions and no answers.  Unless this game gets some serious added content, a total pass-over in the text department I definitely don't recommend it. I can even forgive the bad GFX and SFX... probably.",
