I used to cook for myself and clean my apartment once in a while. I used to have  house plants  for god's sake!   I thought becoming king would take a week or two of gaming sessions at most.

You won't find a game that allows you more freedom in a sandbox medieval setting than this. This can be one of the best games you'll ever play, if you are adventurous and enjoy making up your own scenarios and backstories. If a guided experience is more your vibe, this won't be your cup of tea because it has no main quest line or any real defined goals outside of being your character.  Gameplay is fantastic and the combat is intuitive, with a variety of modifiers should any aspect be too easy or too hard for personal taste. The menus are a little lacking and can be confusing to navigate, but a few hours of play and it comes together. The variety of weapons is great, and having taken the time to read up on how to command troops in battle I feel that while it isn't immediately accessible it isn't terribly obtuse, either.  As if the core game for the price wasn't enough, the mod scene is amazing. Try North South and fight in the American Civil War. Prefer playing in a low fantasy Europe setting? Sure, there are mods for that. Vikings? Bryntwalda. Or maybe you prefer Lord of the Rings as a setting? Yup. That and Game of Thrones both have mods that allow you to truly inhabit these worlds as anyone from a peasant to the highest of Kings. And there are many, many more.  The only thing I see dethroning this as medieval sim king anytime soon is Mount &amp; Blade: Bannerlord.",

Choose your destiny amongst 6 unique factions each of them with their own mentality and troops, or assemble a mighty army from all realms, be a trader or mercenary to a faction or become vassal to a King or even become a King yourself - choices are nigh infinite. You can replay this game an infinite amount of times with different settings and it will remain interesting, and on top of that you can modify certain aspects of the game or go for one of the many mods out there ranging from all kinds epoches and additions (i must admit that M&amp;B 1 fares a little better what regards the amount and quality of mods released). There are some downers: You will experience clipping and other graphic absurdities every now and then, it is not perfect. The AI is a bit dumb-witted at times, in terms of field movements and tactical behaviour - the latter does not really exist actually, it is just troops spawning running towards one another and starting to beat each other up, it is up to you to be better than them. There is a saying that 'a lot of good work is lost over the lack of a little more', this is found to be true here as the grid for many diplomatic and military game options is actually present - it is just not used well by the vanilla game and left for modders to patch up. The modders in turn often work on their own vision of how the game should be but then lacking the manpower to achieve their conveyed goals. Good examples for this might be the 'Sword of Damocles'-Series which is wonderful yet stricken with bugs on M&amp;B 1, and in a seemingly eternal unfinished-we-are-working-on-it-but-play-this-in-the-meantime process on M&amp;B:Warband. Taleworld wanted to encourage modding for this game, but failed to provide an easily accessible scripting interface for modders to work with. This results in a game that is never 100% satisfying in vanilla, and a bunch of mods that aim to provide that satisfaction but fail half-way due to lack of manpower.  Nevertheless i must say i enjoy this game tremendously glad i bought it (M&amp;B Package) as it offers a completly different feel of gaming compared to most more action-oriented games these days. No big explosions or noisy shooting and blurred vision and other mess, just a nice game with nice and sometimes funny NPCs and an eye for the neat things in life as well as a semi-realistic view on what life and war in medival ages might have been like. 8/10",

Players are easily engaged by it, but it bores them pretty damn fast (if we're talking singleplayer). But then again, there are tons of mods. As a multiplayer part, it's fun, but not fantastic. And has the same fast-boredom issue.  Don't expect an epic story (but there are mods containing it, like Prophecy of Pendor), or a deep party management, or something like Shadow-of-Mordor-social-system, or an empire management.

Warband added many new features from the original, and one of the largest was multiplayer. Multiplayer is in my opinion Warband's strongest attribute. The PvP combat is excellent, the maps are well made, and the experience overall is superb. Battles are large and epic, ranging from perhaps 10 people on each side to over 100. The vast array of weapons to use assures a new experience every time you play - everything from One Handed Swords, One Handed Axes, Spears, Bows, Crossbows, Javelins, and huge War Cleavers. Each faction (six in all) has a unique loadout, which adds a unique flavour aswell. Sieges are also quite ferocious and time consuming, some taking almost an hour or more. Combat involves a four-directional combat system, and a simple but practical approach to projectile drop. The community for this game is amazing, although players in Asia and North America may find slight problems finding populated servers due to the majority of players being centered in the EU. The Singleplayer is fun, but very repetitive. Your objective is to have the entire map controlled by one faction or your own. You can do a variety of quests for lords, kings, and villages - but are all repetitive. The character levelling is good, with a good array of choices to make your character how you like. A variety of different mods that are available for this game adds to the replay value of both the Multiplayer and Singleplayer aspects.   Pros +Intuitive Combat +Great Mounted Combat +Sounds and Soundtrack are superb +Singleplayer has wonderful RPG elements +Many mods and additions to add hours of fun to the game  Cons -Aging Graphics -Hit Detection can be a bit sloppy -Does not have DirectX 11 support (DirectX 7 &amp; 9 only) -Smaller community than most games -Singleplayer has many repetitive aspects and quests (which can sometimes be snuffed with mods)  Overall Rating: 8.5/10 (Good game, has a few flaws)",

            "review_text": "Mount &amp; Blade: Warband (along with its predecessor, Mount &amp; Blade) is a game so unique it is difficult to fit it snugly into one category. It's an action RPG, it's grand strategy, it's a simulation, it's open world. This game is a whole bunch of things that melt so perfectly together, and it is unlike any other game I've ever played. For anyone who is even the slightest bit interested in medieval warfare, this is the game you never knew you wanted.  You start out by answering some simple questions about the life your character has lived thus far, and critiquing the way your heroine (or hero) looks. You are thrown into the large continent of Calradia which is split into six unique factions that are constantly at war with each other. The world map is familiar to those of us who enjoy grand strategy games; you can view the land and the castles/towns/villages/hideouts etc. that exist on it at any one time, while your character and her horse moves along it like a pawn on a gameboard. The colors of the names tell you which faction currently owns and controls each piece of land. What you begin to do from here is ultimately up to you. You can try doing favors for lords and kings to win their favor and ultimately work for them, whilst building up a small army of ragtag soldiers that you recruit and hire from various places, or you can be bold and try almost immediately to begin taking over land yourself (which I wouldn't recommend for the first dozen or so hours into the game).  Battles in this game are nothing short of amazing. Both warring sides start out on opposite ends of the map (I've never seen the same battlefield twice, by the way, so I believe they are randomized based on the terrain type you are currently traversing). You can issue commands to your army, and this is fun to mess around with. For example, you can tell your archers to stand their ground and your cavalry to charge the enemy, while giving a different order to infantry. It's all up to you. By default, all units will charge, and for the most part, this is sufficient. You will then meet your enemy in the battlefield, where cavalry can run over infantry, archers can shoot riders off of horses, and you can kill horses while their riders are still living, making them fall face first into the ground before swarming them. Basically, if you've ever seen two opposing sides charge in a movie and have felt that intensity and awe, you can actually play as one of those people involved in Mount &amp; Blade, and each and every time it's amazing. This game is fantastic for nerds like me who love anything medieval; not only are there full out battles like this, but you eventually (and your army) get strong enough to take over castles, towns, etc., and you get to be one of the units that is a part of this, each and every single time.  The goal regardless seems to be to take over the entire map of land, whether through an existing faction or through your own, which you may create once you have a strong enough army to begin taking over land by force. Lords will double cross you, downright insult you, and even beg their respective kings for the rights to a castle you may have taken over yourself, and depending on the circumstance, you may or may not be jipped out of a piece of land you worked hard for. You can then, however, decide to accept that or give a one fingered salute to your king before renouncing your allegiance and going your own way. It is entirely up to you.  I would highly, highly recommend you play as a woman character, even if you are not a woman in real life. The game is fantastic at reflecting the negative attitudes toward women at the time, and those mentalities can highly influence you during the game. For example, I created a woman character and named her after myself, much like I did for the first Mount and Blade. I set about leveling up my character and recruiting soldiers, and picked up a mercenary contract for a faction. After taking over three castles single-handedly for the faction's king, I spoke to the king, introduced myself, and asked to be promoted to being his vassal. He told me outright that he didn't care what I had accomplished. Because I was a woman, I could not be his vassal, and I couldn't own land. I asked him what would happen if I took an enemy castle by force, and he replied that he would 'think about' letting me keep it. This sexist attitude (although very realistic for the time) got me so fired up that I promptly cancelled my contract with the king and began taking over his land by force. After about 40 hours of in-game time, he was exiled from the land, his faction was extinct, and all of his land belonged to a new faction appropriately named 'Rosie's Kingdom of Awesome.' About 40 hours after that, I was Queen of Calradia. But it all started because of my motivation to overthrow an arrogant and sexist king as the woman he insulted, and no other game has done such a great job of inspiring me to create my own grudges and follow through on them until I conquered all.   This game is one of the most perfectly put together pieces of work I've ever played. I've seen people question the graphics, but I think the game is simplisticly beautiful (also, I grew up in the 90s--graphics don't matter to me). The game runs perfectly on my older non-gaming laptop, so that's also a plus for those of you looking for a large scale warfare game that can play on a toaster. There are some glitches, although nothing game-breaking (people spawned on the outside of a castle wall in 2/500 or so sieges I played, and I once had to sit out one siege because I fell through a crack in a floor of a castle tower and floated perpetually until my soldiers won the battle without me and I could exit). The character animations are a bit stiff, but I actually like them that way; it brings humor to the game for me, and if any future Mount &amp; Blade doesn't have the stiff animations, I'll miss them.  Mount &amp; Blade: Warband took 90 hours of my life away in the past week, and very few games can pull me in so relentlessly. This game is one of my personal favorites, along with Mount &amp; Blade (I haven't tried With Fire &amp; Sword yet, but it's only a matter of time). A solid 10/10 from me. Buy this game. Buy it now, and let it consume you. :)",

A glorious combination of deep combat mechanics, kingdom management, and sandbox roleplay, there's really no other game like it in existence.Since its release many games have tried to capture the format to varying degrees.   I have enjoyed watching this game develop from a sleeper hit to a bona fide 'must-play' title over the years.The combat is brutal and intense. There is no hand-holding, and even though you can change the difficulty it is still realistic because no matter how well-armored your character might be, you can still be brought down by a well-placed spear thrust or arrow. The closest thing to experiencing medieval combat outside of the Society for Creative Anachronism.  The mods Floris Mod Pak, A Clash of Kings, and 1257 AD push the envelope and expand the gameplay in exciting new ways.   Buy it during the next steam sale, you will not be disappointed.  Many people play this strictly for the multiplayer, which is worth it by itself. A legion of modders have worked to improve the ultra-realistic combat settings and given players even more places and soldier-types to rend, maim, and kill.",

            "review_text": "What exactly is Mount &amp; Blade? Partly it is a medieval fighting simulator, partly role playing game and partly a strategy game. All of this is present in this huge chunk of buggy code wrapped in mediocre graphics. But that is little too harsh, because this game has something to overcome all of this. Flawless gameplay.  You start by creating your character in not too deep creator. There is couple of background choices which will determine your stats. Stats are the RPG part of the game, you get all the basics like strenght, agility and intelligence, followed by skills that determine your abiliy to hold shields, ride a horse or get better prices from traders. At the very last there are the weapon stats, those are here to tell you how well you will fare with different kind of weapons. You can choose between bows, crossbows, short or long swords, spears and polearms.  After you are done spending your points, you get a piece of the fighting simulator. You get thrown into an one on one fight without any sort of tutorial, this game is expansion after all, so you should already know everything right? Well, in case you did not play the original... Generally you use left mouse button for attacking and right mouse button for defending. That's pretty common right? But that is obviously not everything. By moving the mouse to either of four directions (right, left, up, down) prior to the swing you determine the manner of the attack. To add more fun to this, you can do the same while defending, so basically you have to check your opponent's movement and react fast enough to block. However if you are not up to the challenge you can use automatic blocking, in this case you will only need to time the block and the direction will be automatically chosen by computer. So that's it, quite simple is it not? Other weapons are similar with small differences mostly in possible manners of attacking. Ranged weapons are even more challenging. There is no aim indicator and arrows, bolts or javelins respect the laws of gravity, so it will take a while to get used to it.  Well, that was quite elaborate description of fighting system, I hope I did not bore you. This leaves us with strategy part of the game. So yeah, after you finish your first fight you get your first quest (yep, another sign of rpg) and end up on a huge map, not too unlike Total War world maps, but way uglier, and move your character around. Everything is in real time, but since the time stops everytime your character stops, in principle the game is more similar to turnbased games. So there you are on a huge map, large groups of enemies moving around you. You may try to challenge one of the groups yourself and find out, that you are no hero, just another warrior who gets butchered when facing more than 2 or 3 enemies at once. At this point you get to one of the villages and recruit yourself a bunch of peasants. Soon enough you will find that peasants are more like meat shields and die a lot, but with a piece of luck and good commander (you) they can make it as far as to knighthood. This all sounds more like tactics than strategy right (wink)? Well, to be honest I am not sure how it works in vanilla (unmodded) game, since after original Mount &amp; Blade, in Warband I started with mods right away.  Yes, mods are the greatest thing that could have happened to this game. The basics are great but the game itself needed helluva lot of polishing to become a legend. There are tons of mods ready to be tried and some of them are really robust. I myself am using Floris mod pack (to be find on  nexusmods.com)  which combines many different mods improving graphics and gameplay alike. And the strategy part I was talking about is part of this mod, since in here, before the fight starts you get to strain your mind by choosing how will your units behave during the battle. You had probably already guessed that I think that Mount &amp; Blade: Warband is a good game, well you are right, but with mods, it becomes a GREAT game.",

Tips don't be with one kingdom too long or else they will be hard to defeat if you start you're own kingdom and make sure to go through with quests and missions it helps with your reputation a lot! Also at the beginning stay active in making money from attacking bandits to fulfilling quests and such.

This game made me vote for Trump but I influenced a Lord to exchange his city for my village This game made me destroy ISIS singlehandedly  This game. This game is awesome.  In all seriousness, Mount and Blade: Warband is a game with outdated graphics where you can control a single character and slowly gain power into the world. You recruit soldiers, starting off with mere peasants and work your way up. Soon you can join another faction leader as a mercenary, swear oathes to him, and take control of a village. Soon you will marry, soon you can own a city, and one day a kingdom. Eventually, you may even control the world.  An absolutely fantastic game that is hard not to enjoy, easily a classic. Highly recommended to players who love RTS, RPG, medieval themes, and realistic combat. On top of this all, if you get bored of vanilla, there are hundreds upon hundreds of mods, some of which are total conversion mods meaning entire new campaigns in different settings. There is easily 100 or so hours of gameplay in vanilla, and another several hundred with mods. (really recommend TLD mod, it's a LOTR total conversion)  Game can be slow and can make you ragey at times, and the graphics aren't particularly jaw-dropping, but when you're doing well and commanding an army of 100 men strong and siege castles and raid villages, it's simply fantastic fun. All in all, a rating of 9/10 and an eagerness for the soon to come sequel.",

Mount And Blade Warband does a fantastic job to recreate a medieval world and puts so much effort in detail. You can become a well-respected trader or a warmongering king! The possibilities are endless!  NOTE: When you are more of the historical person (like me), I recommend highly you try the mod 1257 Anno Domini. It's Soooooo good! Exploring medieval Europe in an brutal timeperiod. Become a vassal of one of the many kings, choose your allegiance to one of the countless factions or become a king of your own.   Where Mount and Blade Warband did a very good job, the modders of 1257AD did a fantastic job!  Good Points: - Huge troop choice - Countless possibilities - Eye for detail - Looks amazing  Bad Points: - May become repetitive. But If you can roleplay your hero, you can play this until the end of times. - Relatively slow start. (Building up renown, army, relations,...)  Conclusion: This game earns a 8,5/10  (Note: This is my personal reflection of the game and mod)",

I really wish they were politics involved too, it would really reflect the political instability in Gracemeria, given the turmoil after the meteors.  But Taleworlds really have to work on the penetration system for the weapons. I mean seriously, theres times where I've been one-shotted in the hull armor with by an Arquebusier in mid-lane. As a CSAT Ranger nonetheless, 10 minutes after the paradrop!  Don't listen to the hate either, the microtransactions are very worth it, and are very cheap for the amount of content they give too. I bought a few DLC skins for the MMO mode, where 1000s of players get together in a 3-way faction open war. My recomendation? The Naval Warfare DLC that comes equipped with authentic and historically accurate weaponry for the period.  All in all, flight combat is a blast, avoid the riflemen, try not to get ganked, and romance everyone.   0/10 Terrible Voice acting.",

When you just start creating your new character and send it to the world you are confronted with so many little decisions and adventures that you can take on many approaches. Be a soldier, a merchant, an outlaw or an adventurer - You can do it! The first 10-20 hours in any game are simply pure fun and all are unique in their way. Choosing your lord is exciting, joining a war is exciting, attending tournaments is exciting - it is all just great and has a unique feel that sits just right.  However, the game seem to stop giving an effort at late-game, once you become strong enough to be a lord which is the one and only end-game scenario you can achieve, things become dull and repetetive. You will go about the same way from castle to castle as you slowly see the map turning your color. Expect no suprises, there will be none as politics barely exist and every war can be calculated and work as expected. Once you have the leverage over the game it will stay there and the game basically ends.   The tactics are nice in this game. There are alot of ways to go about into battle and a combination of skill and strategy is needed to curve through a rough enemy. However the AI that is against you is pettiful at best and will always act similiar in terms of strategy, making it too easy to manipulate. there are only handful of scenarios and tactics you need to grasp and once you get familliar with them managing the battle becomes just another repetetive thing.  The economy is also nice, however getting too much into it doesn't help you by much and you can probably profit better by just killing stuff. I still like it being there.  Alot of design flaws... Auto resolved battles between AI is pure ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, it almost does not matter(if at all) which type of troops battle against which type of other troops or it the battle was a siege or an open battle. The AI gets more money than you by having cities and castles which breaks immersion and breaks their whole point of logical economic system and makes you feel as you are treated as a player rather than a character within the world. Diplomacy is merely a joke, there is nothing interesting to do with prisoners. Being captured always ends the same way for you. Characters can't die. Killing bandits is too profitable and destroying their hideouts usually gives you nothing and stops their spawn which is anti intuitive and kills profit. I can go on for ever with the design flaws of this game, but it is expected from a small company.  I mention all this flaws just to say I still recommend this game, because understanding flaws is easy for a reader but understanding the sense of wonder and atmosphere I get each time i open a new character is beyond simple words and I think you should buy the game to experience that.",

Its a role-playing storyline where you customize a guy, that'll get to go from town to town, battling guys, getting a following, etc.  While the graphics, and battles are great, there are some issue's: controls are pitiful, in storymode, press backwards, you'll keep going backwards till you press the forwards button, usually a couple times. Riding a horse is cool...until you keep running into walls, stalls, citizens, etc. in battles, the controls say press the X key to toggle weapons. By pressing the X key, my guy does absolutely NOTHING. The fighting controls are simple and confusing at the same time. Left mouse button attacks, right mouse button defends. Simple. The confusing part is, attacking from the side. Want to do a left-side attack? Hold the left mouse button and move the mouse left. Often miss's. To perfect it, or at least make it good enough to do damage in battle, its gonna take HOURS of practise. Crossbows and bows, while can be handy, except I never killed a single guy in a custom battle!  On the bright side, battles are really good to watch. Feels medieval like.  Oh and one last issue. DO NOT BUY if your computer has a couple already big games installed. Will cause some lag, and may cause computer to act strange(like mine is) while this game aint for me, its worth at least trying. If I had to recommend other games similar, I'd suggest Medieval Kingdoms: Total War, for the medieval fighting.",

The graphics are outdated, but somehow they are good enough to get immersed, especially the castles and battlefields. I suppose the upshot of this is that it will run on virtually any computer people reading this will have.  The single-player sandbox is also quite good, you can either serve a king, or cede and start your own kingdom. Single player is much easier than multi-player, especially when you've upgrades your gear and troops.  If you like medival combat, sandbox gaming, PvP, and have an older computer, I highly recommend this! ",

In a lot of other bot reliant games, I see that you always have to clean up after your bots and they can't really do anything on their own. In Warband, I could easily stroll around in the back of the map while my soldiers win for me. Even though I do not play so much as I used to, this is a game I play for the relaxing factor of single player.  After playing a fair bit of single player, I moved on to multiplayer. Warband has one of the most brutal transitions from single to multiplayer that I have ever experienced.

            "review_text": "TLDR: If you want to play one of the best games ever, you should buy this game. I promise you won’t regret it.  Now that Warband is the first game I've put 1,000 hours on I want to write a review saying just how much I have loved the game. I can honestly say, without a doubt, that Warband is the best game I have ever played and is one of my favorite games ever. Now I am 24 years old and in law school but I have been playing the game since I was 19, and a freshman in college so understand that I have a tremendous love for the game. First we'll start with the good things about the game.  The best thing about the game is the incredible amount of replayability of the game. In the base game alone you can easily put 500 hours in on the game due to the countless options you have in playing the game. You want to play as a mercenary working for whoever pays the most? You can. Do you want to work for a singular nation and take over the entire world for them? You can. Do you want to become the empire of the entire world? You can. Do you want to be a knight, or a Mongol, or an archer, or a crossbowman, or a merchant, or a Viking, or anything in between? Whatever you want to be you can be. The game is a complete sandbox where the world is constantly changing and you find yourself in the center of it all.   The next best thing about the game is the amount of mods that the modding community has created. Do you like Game of Thrones? There’s a mod for that. Are you a fan of Star Wars (like myself)? There’s a mod for that. Are you interested in a more historical mod based on the crusades, or Ancient Rome, or the Trojan war, or Turn of the century Russia, or the Napoleonic era? There are mods for that. If you’re more interested in a high fantasy/Tolkien style? There are numerous mods for that. You are only limited by what you are looking for in a mod, and most of the mods are great. That at least doubles the replayability of the game.  Another great thing about the game is the multiplayer capability of the game. The game has some of the best multiplayer that I’ve ever experienced. Both the vanilla game, and the DLC include multiplayer versions that you can play. The mechanics of multiplayer can be difficult to learn, and even more difficult to master but when you get good at the combat the multiplayer becomes even more fun. The Napoleonic Wars DLC is a great value especially if/when you join a regiment for the game. I’ve met people from the ages of 10-60+ playing multiplayer and a lot of them are very cool people. I started playing multiplayer in February and just under half my hours are multiplayer now.  Now we will talk about some of the areas the game is slightly problematic. The biggest turn off for people is generally the very basic graphics of the game. Warband itself if 6 years old, and the graphics were already dated when it came out so the graphics have not aged well. If you are someone who refuses to play a game unless it has the best graphics this game is certainly not for you. Another turn off is that some of the mechanics are a little off, due to its age. The rag dolls are usually awful, and the AI is even worse, however sometimes the AI and ragdolls can create some great and humorous memories. Furthermore the initial difficulty of the game can turn people off from it, because the game is NOT easy; as soon as you learn how to play though it is a great game that you will not get tired of easily.  The other bad part of the game kind of goes hand in hand with the multiplayer modes in the game. A lot of the Warband community (particularly the NW community) is toxic in every sense of the word. Imagine CoD community, heightened by the difficulty of the game. The community is oftentimes terrible, however if you join a group or a regiment you find a new layer of the community. For me, I joined the 21st Regiment of Foot in February and ever since I have loved playing multiplayer and have made countless friends through the regiment. If you find a group to play with the community becomes actually quite fun.  Ultimately I cannot stress enough how great the game is, and it is pretty cheap as well especially when you get it on sale. The game itself goes on sale all the time and if you can find it for under 10$ it will be one of the best 10$ you will ever spend. When I first got the game I got it on sale for 5$ and have well made up for that price in hours played. So in the end if you want to play one of the best games ever, you should buy this game. I promise you won’t regret it.",

You'll be spending a lot of time in singleplayer going up and down trying to get somewhere in the game but you'll have tons of fun while doing so. And once you get somewhere oh man does it feel good. Multiplayer is a blast especially with the Napoleonic Wars DLC (musket warfare!!!) and even the native multiplayer is god damn fun with player caps reaching to 200 players! 100 vs 100 in brutal and intense sieges and battles provides you with endless fun!

            "review_text": "This one is interestig, in a good way. Mount &amp; Blade places you in a far away medival land with nothing but your wit, a horse, some weapons and some clothes. There are some factions you can join and fight for, but the point of the game is that you don't NEED to. There is no finite goal. Want to become the king of the land and rule the entire map? Sure can do. Want to be a bandit king and stike fear in the hearts of trade caravans? Sure can do. Want to be a lowly soldier in some army and fight for the money? Sure can do.  M&amp;B is a sandbox game, a damned good one too. The combat is easy to learn, yet hard to master and very satisfying, and also very adjustable to your preferred playstyle. Blocking is a challenge in itself on higher difficulties, and fighting multiple enemies at once can be really hard if you are alone. Being outnumbered can end up with you taken as a prisoner (you can't die in battle or be sold to slavery, you will escape sooner or later and have to start from scratch), but luckily, if you don't like that sort of thing, you can set the enemies to only do half or a fifth of the damage that you can do.  The only negative thing that I have is the AI. When you are travelling across the map, the AI will attempt to follow paths DESPERATELY. Even if that means that you will run into an enemy and get slaughtered, all for a measly 0.5 speed increase for walking on roads. Similarly, the combat AI is also not the greatests. Your allies will not attempt to hold a strategic position, such as a mountain, but rather charge right into the enemy.  Oh yeah, and the graphics suck. Low quality textures and an extremely low amount of polygons per model. It works, don't get me wrong, but it is not pretty. The trailer is very accurate when it comes to graphics.  The sound design is very nice, good and fitting music and neat combat screams. You can even extract the music from a folder and ctrl-c ctrl-v them somewhere else so you can listen to your favorite soundtracks whenever you want to.  With mod support this one is easily worth the money, maybe wait for a sale and get it with all expansions for around 20$/€. Thats what I did.",

The hours I put into Mount and Blade are but a fraction of these other games, yet I am equally as fond of M&amp;B.   This game's combat system is one of the most immersive 1st person experiences I have ever had in a video game. It is so easy to get lost in the atmosphere of medieval warfare. An arrow hurdling through the air right past your air will make you flinch! You feel the weight of an iron-hewn axe pounding the face of your splintered wooden shield.   Consider playing this game, as it is revolutionary when it comes to hand to hand combat in the first person.

If you cannot stand trolls or team griefing, dont play on the servers obviously and stay to the single player aspect, because let me tell you around peak hours for servers there are many trolls, but i find them pleasant in a game like this. Take a look at my screenshots, you should see some of the faces people create for they're characters. And they're names, oh lord, always funny relevant names.  If you want a good multiplayer experience i say play siege on 63e in the server tab. Around 5-8 pm EST, when its at peak hours for nearly 200/200 players online. Like i said if you cant handle trolling or very vulgar banter, dont play the multiplayer aspect , atleast during its peak-hours, but i think its something you get used to and the trolls have a certain charm.

Wondering around growing your forces, going to tournaments, causing intrigue with the local lords, raiding villages, fighting in wars. Those are the kinds of things you primarily do. Its surprisingly much more satisfying than Rome Total War, where you start to dread entering battles. Clobbering through enemies never really gets old, although infantry to infantry combat could stand some improvement (the game is built around riding on a horse, as per the name). Think of it as Dynasty Warriors Total War with a faint hint of Crusader Kings.  There's a lot of different approaches in playstyle, army composition, etc. So while I imagine there's a lot of replay value in the full game (seems like it would take quite a long time to become king or have your faction take over the world), you'll probably want to play it again to take another approach.  All in all, its easy to get into, and doesn't seem to get boring, even though I played the demo for about double my steam time a few years ago.",

This is by far my favorite game to this date, and with the expansion to the series (Bannerlord) coming out within the next year, It will likely remain that way. Although the game certainly lacks in graphics - due to it being developed by an indie developer several years ago - there is a certain charm to the game that keeps you playing it. Some mods greatly improve on the graphics of the game, with new models and textures, and the modding community for this game is massive. There are thousands of mods for the game, and atleast 12 full make-over mods that give you a completely new experience in the game, giving you many choices for the kind of kingdom that you want to build.

The game will challenge your tolerance to difficulty and time management in life (I've missed dates for this game)   The game will throw you into a never peaceful land of Caldaria  The game will have you lead your 500 man army against another 500, or a castle or an entire city. You know the beach scene from Saving Private Ryan? Like that except you're there with way more bloodshed.  The game will have you staring at the screen for minutes to hours questioning ever decision made. Will it screw you over? Will it give you more power? Are you greedy? Evil? You choose my friend.  The game will have you owning an entire empire. The empire's cost being up to you.   The game will allow you to choose what to do with the other factions. Do you side with them? Create a diplomacy? Split the continent in 1/2 or maybe less? Or do you sweep the land?  The game will have you hiding behind your castle walls as perhaps hundreds and maybe a thousand men are throwing up ladders and sieging your walls, burning your towns.  But most importantly, the game will fill your whole of power, accomplishment and overall fulfillment of a great sandbox game that will forever go in history. If you can buy the game.

Entire fortresses may fall beneath your banner, or you might simply be shot down at their walls, depending on your choices and party configurations.  -An incredibly simple, but somehow intricate diplomacy system that allows you to gain nobility and make alliances within nations, from gaining foothold for your king or leader, to staging an uprising to overthrow him.  Cons: -After some time, it can get repetitive completing the same missions over and over to improve relations with lords and nations. -There is no learning curve. If you make the mistake of making too many enemies, you will fall. Simple as that.  ",

            "review_text": "I kept hearing about this here and there but did not quite understand what it was. After purchasing I thought 'Ah, it's a MMORG with huge battles with other players'. WRONG. I then came to the conclusion 'Ah, it's a RPG'. Kinda. What it turned out to be was a sandbox type experience set within a large continent divided into various kingdoms. As a player you drift around the land fighting for yourself or others with the aim of building up your reputation, wealth and standing. Whether that is for yourself or for one of the established rulers is up to you.   By building an army you can make futher gains up the reputation tree and it's the battles that really make this game shine. Huge armies clash on various terrains and these are what really make this so much fun to play.  I won't give any more details away as it would ruin the fun of discovering things for yourself but this is thoroughly recommended, go buy.",

            "review_text": "This game is great but unforgiving. What this game will give you in my personal opinion: It will give you the satisfaction of being whatever you want. Want to be a marauder, sure go for it. A mercenary go ahead be one, a loyal vassal to a king go ahead and suck up to the king, become a king? Sure. Keep in mind that you can be anything as long as is combat based, don't expect it to be &lt;insert favorite medieval/fantasy game here&gt; because you can't be a bartender or assasin or anything too fancy.  As for the combat, winning usually goes to the one with most soldiers, or who is better equiped. At the start if you are not careful you will get robbed constantly by bandits, the looting sucks unless you are willing to upgrade your character or kill a merchant. The game is especially hard on female characters, although there is a faction that supposedly has no probs with female characters. Try not to wage war on a faction early on because they will send you to El Calabozo. Getting out of prison is not hard, getting out of enemy territory, evading patrols, evading bandits, aquiring money and rebuilding the army is the hard part.",

            "review_text": "It's a good game that's pretty fun, but I won't waste time saying whats good, but instead about the bad points which may drive you away.  -AI The AI is almost on something like Digital Homicide level. It has troubles doing almost anything on it's own, with a lot of trouble from navigating simple terrain. Though I do have to say it is 100X better then the first game, as in the original the AI couldn't even navigate most castles. While this can be ignroed mostly, it will cause a little anger towards those moments when a unit could have secured victory but failed to do the simplest task.  -Play trackng. Maybe I'm just paranoid, but it seems the AI tracks the player. When in the arena, I've noticed groups of enemies breaking off from a fight just to follow me, getting up to 4+ people attacking me at once. And it doesn't seem to be based off of any in-game factors, as from start to finish it seems to remain the same. This can make combat extremely difficult for the player, as it is hard to fight off multiple troops when they are set on killing you alone.  -Feels unfinished. Many aspects of the game feel like they were being created, but ceased so the game could release. While it isn't too big a problem, you will clearly see some things that should have been worked on.  -Forced opening quest. Unlike the original where you start off by a training field, you are forced to kill a bandit and meet the merchant. While it isn't technically forced, the merchant will remain there untill you help him. And the annoying thing is that you must do it each and every new game.  -Should have been the original. Simply put, this amount of work should have been put into the original. This feels like the improvements they should have made to the original as it went on. It's kind of like an aplha game, except they made improvements and sold it as a serperate game. The only real reason to buy the original would be to play some older mods, which are mostly ported to Warband now. Other then that, it's a buggy mess which shouldn't have been abandoned.  -Nothing is hardly explained. There are many features that are never explained in the game. Just recently, around 500 hours in, I discovered that retiring actually gave a score and ending story for your charecter. There are also many other things I'm guessing I don't know, which can be a fault ofthe game trying to keep to much information for you to learn.  Overall it is a good game, but it isn't the best out there. The original Mount and Blade was like the 20-30% completion mark, with this being the 30-50% mark. I'm hoping bannerlord will be a more complete game, as it seems the games have each been a stepping stone to a final, bigger, product.  This will end the review, thanks for reading.",

            "review_text": " Mount &amp; Blade: Warband  is the best medieval simulation I've ever played. The way it was executed was excellent and TaleWorlds deserves nothing but praise for the obvious effort they've put into this game. Though the graphics are nothing to be marvelled at (for good reason), the gameplay is great: The combat is fluid and responsive, with a focus on perfect hitboxes and timing attacks, and the make-your-own adventure feeling of the game adds to it's fun and political based world. I bought this game some months back and at first I simply could not put it down, clocking over 50 hours within the first week and a half! The game is truly addicting by nature.  Though the graphics are nothing to marvel at, the game still looks good in what it's intended purpose is: massive scale battles in which you control a sole character amongst hundreds of soldiers on a battlefield. If the graphics were too over the top, I could see many framerate issues on older machines. However it's something you don't really notice because you're too busy hacking and slashing your way to victory. Each battlefield is fully rendered and require  no loading times past the initial load , which is impressive for how varied each of the environments are. Each castle in the game is unique, and there are dozens of them to siege and take for your particular faction. There are also dozens of cities which also have their own unique look and style which can also be sieged and taken for yourself.  The combat is fantastic. It's responsive and the hitboxes are perfect. If some one shoots an arrow at your side and it hits your shield, it will hit your shield eventhough you don't have it raised. If some one shoots you in the back while your shield is on your back, the shield will protect you from the arrow. If you attack from the left and your opponent blocks to their left, you'll land a hit. If yout attack to the left and the opponent blocks to their right, they'll block your attack. You can also feint an attack to make it seem like you're attacking from a certain direction and then come in with a strike from the opposite direction, tricking your opponent into blocking themselves on the wrong side, scoring yourself a hit. It's things like this that make the combat interesting and challenging, as it has a certain amount of depth to it that will keep you guessing on what your opponent is going to do next.  The make-your-own adventure style is strong with this one. You can literally do anything you feel like, as it is an open sandbox style of game. Want to join one of the warring kingdoms to help your leader achieve dominance over the domain of Calradia? You most certainly can. Want to create your own faction to vie for power yourself and take the throne of Calradia for your own? Of course you can do that too. Want to be a brigand and rob caravans, and amass a fortune to rival even the wealthiest of kingdoms? Go ahead. There is a lot of creative freedom in what you can do in the game, which encourages multiple playthroughs with characters that have different skill sets.  The game also supports online multiplayer which is very smooth and runs very well. Participating in massive scale battles where every soldier is a player is a blast, and where the game truly shines as people are much more clever than any AI could be, making the multiplayer the most challenging part of the game. There are still plenty of people that are online in the multiplayer portion of the game, so don't let the release date of the game fool you; people are still very much active in the online portion of the game.  The game also has several DLC expansions (I have the viking conquest expansion, which is a lot of fun) that change up the gameplay immenseley. Fire and Ice adds guns to the game, which completely revolutionizes ranged combat (like it did in the real world), Viking conquest adds longboat battles, so you can now take to the sea and fight other vikings in large scale longboat warfare. The game is also fully moddable and you can find plenty of them to keep the game fresh and interesting no matter how long you've been playing it for.  Overall, it doesn't get much better than this in the medieval simulation genre. If that's your thing I could not recommend Warband more. If I were to give it a rating it would be 9/10, the only thing holding it back from a perfect score being the graphics. You're guaranteed to get dozens of hours of enjoyment from this title if you love medieval simulation, if not hundreds of hours for the most infatuated. The combat system is impeccable, the make your own adventure style is done very well, the freedom to create your own story is present, the online multiplayer is alive and well, and being able to mod the game keeps it fresh and interesting for multiple playthroughs.  In conclusion, buy this game. You will not regret it. I've only had the game for a short time and it quickly became one of my favourite games ever made. If you're a fan of medieval simulation, you owe it to yourself to experience  Mount &amp; Blade: Warband ",

Mount and Blade (MB) will offer tactics and teamwork to the players who found it difficult manoevering around a quick succession of buttons to jump and no-scope your way out of a close encounter with the opposing team. The large scale warfare wil re-inact the deadly elements of the medieval battlescene, with servers supporting games of over 200 other combatents. I highly recommend purchasing the Napoleonic Wars DLC, unlike CoD's similar priced DLC which grants you access to a few extra maps, this DLC could be sold as a seperate game, and yes, their are new maps being added nearly every day thanks to user modification which are moderated by secure servers.

There was a discount on it, so i decided ' Why not, let's bring the old memories'. It was worth this 6 Euro. If you want to play this game, wait for a discount 'Like this'. I'm personally a big fan of the RPG's and the whole series. Paradox Entertainment's series HAS the potential for... Let's say 37 percent. The modders do a huge piece of work out there, raising it to 55 percent. Would a person sitting aside better games buy it: On a discount.  This RPG series deserves the 6,75/10 for sure.",

It can take a very long time to play this game since relationships are hard to increase unless you want to enlist in a lord's army and talk to them a lot to get it at least to 15. The game will certainly fill that medieval combat and army’s you always wanted to do. Good melee combat and rang combat which is very helpful at picking a good amount of enemies and you do feel like a soldier from medieval time you are not overpower in like many other games and while you can get a good amount of kills you can die very easy and there goes your control over the battle. You will get destroyed many times in this game. You can command your army and plan ways to deal many deaths without losing a lot of your army and will you will lose some and many more when you start out. However this game suffers many drawbacks mostly due to the nature of the games age and time. This game does not look very good even with mods that do improve it but it’s not Skyrim which also in not the best looking game for a long while. It also suffers from the NPC and I would say greatly the NPC are so bland and dull to the extreme. They have no life and only say things with a few change words whatever this is due to the games age and or developers of this game I would say so. I have a very difficult time trying to feel and get into the game. It just so set back by the NPCs they are boring and what holds this game up are the mods and the medieval combat and the sort of RTS elements.  Would I recommend this game I would if you are interesting in the medieval combat of this game and feeling like a commander of a Amy you charge towards you enemy and smite them down whatever you plan to become king or lead a faction to victor. Fighting and trying to take out many enemies yourself to give you and get a lead over you enemy in battle you do make a difference in battle and if that looks good would say buy the game. And there are mods that can and will improve a lot of details and enjoyment of the game even though now I cheat as in I change my characters file to have my player have like 1000 life and pretty along with it one shot most things I can still be beaten and simply being over whelmed by numbers.   However I will warm anyone that if you are looking for interesting npcs and a game that feels really alive in a world that is alive. This game has almost none of that, again that has always been a big problem with me and this game it just feels complete dead npcs towns people wildlife it’s all feels dead they always say the same stuff with a word or a few more change depend on what’s going on. All are very boring and you will end up barely paying heed to what npcs say.  ",

There's just so much stuff to do in this game. Customisation is also great. You can pick from a large variety of armor and weapon. I'd keep going but just give it a try!

What I like about warband is there are various different activities in the fictious world of Caldaria, from figthing bandits, to playing politics, trade, arena fighting, or even starting your own rouge nation from the ground up.  I also really like how the combat works, because you can control which direction your character attacks and with weapons you have to match attack directions with block directions to make the most out of melee combat. Ranged combat also has some interesting features where it takes into account your movement and projectile drop off when taking shots. That light RPG aspect comes into play also as your character gets stronger, faster, and more precise as you develop his skills, making him either into a lethal warrior, an agile bowman, or a cunning tactician. Which gives the game a lot of flexibilty as to how you go about it.  The world is a true sandbox in that it doesn't require you to do anything or go certain ways, but gives you all the tools to make things happen your way but also have the world adapt to your actions in a way that forces you to continually change your tactics when approaching situations.  I myself have sunk hundreads of hours into this game and have reccomended it to everyone I know on steam. I would even go as far as to say that this is one of my favorite games of all time. This is definitely a must own game, and if your not aware of it and like hack/slash gameplay with character skill progression give it a shot.",

            "review_text": "A lot of my friends on steam ask me about this title so I decided to rewrite my initial review, so here goes.  Let me start off by saying that Mount &amp; Blade Warband is a great game.  The game is set in the dark ages with 6 Factions spread over Calradia which is the only world you will know for a couple of days once you start playing this game.  This game is highly addictive and once you get hooked you won't be able to stop.  The aim of the game is to conquer Calradia and you can either join up with a faction and help them fight to conquer all of Calradia or you can start your own faction and become the ruler yourself or the last option is joining a Claimant to one of the 6 factions and retake their throne but the game is not as easy as it sounds.  You start off with just you alone and the history you choose at character creation will determine what skills and inventory items you have at game start, from there you start recruiting soldiers and companions to help further your cause in the many third or first person battles you will have and even though there are many companions in Calradia not all of them get along so it will take some time to figure out how to manage them.   As you progress through the game the types of battles you have changes from fighting bandits and pirates in the start to gear up and make some gold to full on castle and town sieges. When you start you attack groups of bandits anywhere between 5 - 15 bandits in a group, but as the game progresses and you level up your character and companions and get bigger armies the battles sometimes scale to 2000+ troops. With only your horse and your choice of weaponry ranging from Bows, Crossbows, Lances, Axes, Swords, Maces and Throwing weapons like daggers &amp; Javelins the fun is endless.   This game will take up a lot of your time especially if you decide to start your own faction or claim Calradia for a claimant. But it is time well spent.  There are also thousands of mods for this game that opens new worlds for conquering.   1 Mod I will definately reccomend for the base game is the Diplomacy Mod, it doesn't change the core game at all but gives you more speech options and outcomes when treating and talking with other vassals &amp; kings. In my opinion Diplomacy Mod is a must have.  My Rating - 10/10 It simply is a awesome game.",

But I escaped! A lone soldier carrying only an axe and shield. The bandits rode away with my 6 surviving men as prisoners. Their mistake was to let me escape, I now had a purpose. Despite being underlevelled and unskilled I attacked those bandits 1 on 30, and was captured again, and again, and again. But each time I got stronger, each time I learned more about how to combat them and whittled down their number until I finally broke them and got my men back! Now I was a hunter of Desert Bandit, crushing all who stood in my way until their lair lay in ruins before me!  1 year in game time later and I own several villages and castles and hold an army 100 strong. I sometimes visit those bandits and smash the ♥♥♥♥ out of them for old times sake.  WOULD RECOMMEND.  And the multiplayer is fun too.",

            "review_text": "I have to say that this might be my current favorite game. I have totally lost my life to it, since in only 3 days I have almost 20 hours logged in it.   If you are the kind of gamer that likes; middle ages, fast paced melee combat, managing a kingdom (I don't have one yet, I only have 2 villages after 20 hours.) large good looking maps with up to hundreds of units hacking it out. Then you will most likely love this game.  As a disclaimer I have a brand new high end gaming computer, so if you system is at or just better then the reccommended you might have issues, I don't know, all I know is that I don't have a single flaw when I play. I also have yet to play any multiplayer, so if you want to know about that you might want to read another review.  Some quick pros and cons.  Pros; +A long and tricky balance working your way up in the ranks of your chosen faction. (lots of gameplay) +Smooth fastpaced melee and ranged combat. +Simple easy to use controls. +Many different job/quest types. (Adds some varity.) +Large army were each unit thinks and acts on its own, or follows simple commands. (Follow me, Charge, Fall back, ect. (Default is charge.)) +The chance to go from peasant or son (or daughter) of a fallen lord to as high as King. +Defeat isn't the end! You are only captured, loose your normal troops, some gold and an item or 2. Then you get released or escape. (if you get another army you can free your captured troops.) +Free troop training, and you get exp as well. (Go-to a training camp and spar with your troops to train them. No gold needed.)  Cons; -No autosave, so make sure you save OFTEN! -Female faces are UGLY! (the male faces arn't bad) -Some starts are unplayable. (step out of the first town on your first quest to get troops, and get attacked by bandits. I had this happen 3 times in a row.) -After your army grows, sometimes you cannot complete some quests, because your too slow to catch up to a target. -No multiplayer in main campaign. (would have been pretty easy with a few minor changes to time progression.) -Not alot of varity. Kill some bandits. buy some troops. Train troops. Buy/steal food. Train troops. Sack a village. Fight off raiding armies. Buy troops. ect. -Hard to make gold when your faction is at peace.  Thats all I can think of off the top of my head, time to go back and keep playing.  Overall 7/10 (multiplayer in main campaign would make it 8.)    ",

You might as well be the first one to get an arrow in the face and drop like a rock.  -Ability to play the game on a single save file ( You never die even if defeated in battle because you always drop unconcious and then taken as prisoner. But if this happens you lose your army and maybe some of your inventory. So 'dying' in battle is a huge blow and that is why you can't just go out and play a hero, you gotta watch your back because in the end it can take just an arrow or two within a second.  -Great combat system for attack and defence ( attack from left/right/top/center defend from left/right/top/center etc)  -Great RPG progression system ( You can level up your character to be a strong warrior or perhaps go into another direction like leadership, etc. ) and there is also room for progression.  -Own villages, towns and castles and earn money from them.  -Great reputation system.  -So so much more, the game is great, I wont go into anything more since if you really want to know more there are hundreds of reviews out there that go into specifics.

This game dont have two-man tall swords (But some modders have added them), dont have fantasy beasts or elves or even dwarfs ( Well, mods have them). Shame that Native module is boring (Try the Diplomacy or Silverstag modules, they are most fun without breaking the base game idea). And yeah this game have great community who still working on the improvements of game ( One bad moment that some mods got repitive at ideas and compilations of features). If you looking for 'One-of-many' melee fight, or even line-battle firefights (Napoleonic wars DLC for MP, and Sayazn module for SP line-battles). This game will hook you for hours without geting boring (MODS! MODS! MODS!). I bought it two times personally, first in 2009 on DVD and second was a digital copy from steam, and didnt regret it ever, but not tried all features, mostly because this is real 'role-play' sandbox medieval game. Get it and ride into battles, build court relationships, have fun with pillages, spend your nerves with sieges and have fun in world of Calradia (Or Westeros, or Middle-Earth, or Old Europe or even Warhammer fantasy, as modders still doing little miracles for community)",

I climbed up the ladder of success, smashing my enemies, conquering cities and castles, bringing war all over the beautyful lands of Calradia.

            "review_text": "Have you ever watched a movie, or played a game and hated a character in it? Well Mount &amp; Blade Warband is the game for you!  In this game you can do things like, oh I don't know. KILL EVERY MAIN CHARACTER YOU DISLIKE BECAUSE OF THEIR BEARD... well sorry, you cant 'kill them' You just murder all their friends and then take them as prisoners or sell them into slavery for the rest of their sorry lives so they can regret their neck beard that looked at you wrong.  At this point in the review you should have bought it....  But if that sales pitch didn't work just look at my hours!  Do you really think someone like me, a five year old kid with good grammar  Who seems to know the english language too well  Would possibly waste that much time on something boring? NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO    I have one word for people who dislike this game, (insert insulting word here),   they are just mad that they cannot defend their friends and families  from the onslaught of marauding pychopaths that exist in-game.    This game is plain amazing, so amazing that it mocks real life!  No not with its graphics-  But with the fact that as soon as you make a new game, starting a new life,  a bunch of important people hate you for existing! Isn't that great?   ITS JUST LIKE HIGHSCHOOL!   Not like I would know though, im appearently five!  and you will believe me because im advertising something!  so be quiet and buy this product ^.^    For those people who think every game needs a pro and con list here you go you petty insignificant pleb- PROS (that means things that are good about it for people who don't know) -is a game -can be played -worth your time -just buy it you little whimp, scared you will be killed by bandits in five seconds? -its basically Skyrim on a larger scale with better combat and mechanics. CONS (everything written on your birth certificate) -the graphics (I guess?) if you for some reason have a 180p fetish -pretty much nothing -some more nothing -if you haven't bought the game by now you are probably a Call of Duty fan -get a life and stop reading this, you can start by buying the game.  If at any time you felt offended whilst reading my review, remember that because of the fact that I played this game and took over the entire world I am the king of the land. And as a king I have the right to tell a dirty peasant what they are. Unless of course you want to prove me wrong by buying the game and fighting me yourself for kingship. If not then I take nothing back and its all true fo sho.             If you didn't notice I ran out of things to say  like ten words in,  I wrote this review for people  who are offended by dirty  neckbeards.                                                                  10/10, would write stupid review again ",

It will swallow you whole and digest you without exception.  Mount &amp; Blade: Warband is a 2011 RPG by Taleworlds Entertainment. While other RPGs only pretend to let you tell your own story, Mount &amp; Blade actually does.  In the war-torn world of Calradia, you play as an entirely customizable character.  You can decide to either  a) help one of the six fractions, b) one of the six claimants for each throne,  or you can  c) create your own faction entirely by yourself d) be a peaceful merchant instead.  Most of the time you travel around the poorly presented, yet big, but negligible, map.  You visit various lifeless towns and villages, on the quest of gaining renown and money. You talk with lords and ladies, you capture and sell lords, you fight raiders. You win or lose tournaments, you get rekt by bandits when you simply wanted to visit the horse merchant. You receive a small, yet enormously rich village by your king which you find devastated by an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who somehow managed to teleport across the entire map. You travel with your mates Jeremus and Artimenner who start ♥♥♥♥♥ing around who is the better doctor. Following a group of soldiers who promise some mighty fine loot, you discover that you have nothing to eat, because the chicken you had bought have rottened.  And at the end of the day, when it's already 3AM you finally manage to turn away your face from the monitor and ask yourself: What have I done? Shouldn't I have spared this group of poor villagers?  ALL HAIL TALEWORLDS ENTERTAINMENT Mount &amp; Blade: Warband really isn't a perfect game. It's graphics are short above awful, combats are sometimes deeply frustrating, quests are repetitive, the lords and ladies of Calradia all seem to do the exact same stuff, feasts resemble an exhibition of Gunther Hagens' 'Body Worlds'... The list of cons is near infinite. But at the same time, Mount &amp; Blade is a perfect sandbox. You can do whatever you want to. The story might be non-existant in the game, but inside your head it turns into the best story you have ever seen inside a game. You write your own story.

            "review_text": "If you are a fan of RPGs like me, you are going to love this little gem.  Although it has a few years, it still holds up pretty well. That is, if you ignore the graphics and some of the clunky mechanics. When I first found it some years back, I thought it had an interesting concept that I had never really encountered before in a medieval-type RPG, like choosing your background and what drives you to do what you in the story. However, it has little to no importance to what happens during the game, unless you are actually roleplaying an avengeful warrior that was born as a street urchin.  I would have liked to see an cross between those elements so that your own story could be even more rich. Perhaps the loved one you lost was murdered by a specific (that the game chose, or you chose, going as far as choosing the motives maybe?) lord of a faction, and seeking vengeance against said lord is sort of like your 'main objective' until you confront him (and kill him?). Better yet, you should be able to have a menu where you could actually stipulate your objectives, and a narrative would be drawn from it. Maybe the lord begs for his life and persuades you into helping him overthrow the higher-ups, until the end, where you stab him in the back and become lord of all, while tales of what you did could be told in the inns of many castles. Then again, that's just my idea of what would make this game even better.  Pros: -Medieval period, which means a lot of bloody combats and diplomatic confrontations.  -You can have your own faction/kingdom, including territory that you can capture, your own House sigil, and even a bride if you are into that sort of thing!  -Awesome sieges and different tactics that you can employ by giving commands to archers/infantry/horsemen.  -A wide variety of scenarios (Desert, Snowy Hills, Green Mountains, and even Steppes).  -Interesting combat where you can parry your opponent and attack in different directions.  Cons: -The A.I. shows its age, and it's not the best. The enemy often just charges towards you (or whoever they are targeting) in a barrage of blows like mindless zombies. They don't really strategize and usually break formations when the fight happens, and when it does, there isn't much... beauty, if we can call it that, in the swordplay. As an example, if you are the last person standing, the enemy will often form a line while they are after you, instead of trying to surround you. It's almost like they are the Cliff Racers from Morrowind!  -There should be more variety in the conversations. After the 200th time you are talking with a lord or a peasant, you start to get bored of seeing the same options and doesn't stick out.  -Although there are different factions, (that resemble Barbarians, Khans, French/British knights, Vikings and Moors), they don't really have distinct customs and manners of speech, which could spice up the conversations a lot more. In the end, they are all the same besides the different armor/weapons/territory/flags.  -Customization. In an RPG, you should be able to customize your character to the best of your liking, but the truth is, almost all of the characters are kind of ugly to look at. I made many attempts to make an elegant knight, but failed miserably. Come on, at least let me dye the hair in different colors!    In the end, if you like the setting and enjoyed playing the demo, I believe you could have dozens of hours of fun with this game!",

Automatic blocks and swings based on emeny position. At first you may FEEL like this is cheating, but trust me, it's not. It makes the game a little easier, but the enjoyment of this game doesn't come from having MLG PRO SKILLZ at the combat (Unless you are playing multiplayer) it comes from being a badass lord with a kick ♥♥♥ army that pwns everything in his/her path!   Do tournements to level and get some money.  Level Training and Tactics! (After at least level 4 in Ironflesh and heavy swing) Training will SAVE YOUR BOOTY. It makes losing a ton of troops SOO much easier to deal with. (Tactics is kinda iffy depending on who you ask, but the way I see it: it's a must have at 6 or so minimum [gains benefits every 2 levels, so don't leave it at 7 or something])  Don't pledge yourself to a lord just yet! Remain their mercinary so the weekly pay will cover the cost of your army!  Raid enemy villages! (Make sure no enemy lords are around) you can make MAD bank doing this. Just make SURE you are at war with the faction you are raiding. Otherwise you WILL lose honor and it WILL bite you in the ♥♥♥ later on. (RiP my friends nation 'The Booty', had no allies and was wardeced by everyone ;-;)  UNDERSTAND THAT THE GAME CAN AND WILL ♥♥♥♥ YOU OVER AND OVER AGAIN. Sometimes you just get those downward spirals. you lose all your troops, get caputred, escape halfway across the map in the middle of enemy territory, get caputred again, escape, leave you computer for 2 seconds to grab a glass of water and come back to find sea raiders have caught you, and then go cry in a corner. It's the nature of the game. THIS is why training is so important. Training will make bouncing back from these setbacks SOOO much easier! Training is what I call a 'MUST HAVE' skill, as it makes the game SO much more forgiving. Even if it doesn't help a lot with higher level troops, it makes it so you get T2 or T3 troops SO FAST after losing all your troops to MOTHER♥♥♥♥ING SEA RAIDERS @(#*I$)(@*#$)(@#$ ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥ GO DIE IN A HOLE ♥♥♥♥ YOU SEA RAIDERS  ♥♥♥♥ SEA RAIDERS.

            "review_text": "Mount and Blade Warband.  Short: Phenomenal, fun, many hours to be had, medieval fighter.    Medium: Warband is a game set during the early-high medieval period. It hass a multiplayer and singleplayer game where you control your character. In singleplayer, you have a giant map of Calradia to roam and conquer, do quests, and become the new king. The multiplayer is solely combat-based, no map, just combat funtimes.    Long: Welcome to Calradia, a war-torn piece of land split between the Rhodoks, Nords, Vaegirs, Swadians, Sarranids, and Khergits. Each faction with its unique weapon choices. IE. Rhodoks with their kite shields and crossbows, Nords with their axes and round shields, Khergits with their horse archers, Vaegirs with their sabers, Swadians with their great swords, and Sarranids with their spears and lances. Each faction also has unique armor. Rhodoks have a more militia-style armor, favoring cheaper and less durable clothing, Swadians with their stereotypical medieval armor, Sarranids with an Arab-style armor, Khergits with a Mongol-Arab style armor, Vaegirs with their Russian armor, and the Nords, with their Viking-style armor.   The singleplayer is a giant map of Calradia, with towns and cities dotting the map. From there you can recruit special NPCs or regular levies or occasionally mercenaries. As you fight with those troops, they gain experience, and with that, they can use it to upgrade their armor and weapons to a higher tier, or take a different upgrade path. With them, you fight bandits who roam the map, and when you are strong enough, you can fight a noble, and attempt to capture them (Or start a war) and ransom them. With a rather in-depth diplomatic system, running from noble to noble to invite them to your war path is interesting. Quests are endless, although many are mundane, there are a few special quests that grant large rewards.  The multiplayer is a bit different. Multiplayer is a combat-oriented system, you join a server and fight. Gamemodes range from epic two-team shield walls to gladiator-pit style free-for-alls.   Warband has many interesting mods to offer, so take a look!  Now. Go forth and become the king of Calradia!",

The Combat -   The combat in this game is undeniably the best combat style/ Is extremely accurate as to what armour you are wearing, how much protection it gives you, and what weapon you are using, and how much damage it does to the enemy.  Trading System -  Not much to say about the buying/selling of this game, you dont start of with alot of gold that you can make a huge army in an instant, you gotta be carefull what you spend it on, and you have to make sure you have enough money to supply food for your army and also pay them.  Army AI -   Oh my god, if anyone has anything bad to say about this well then you should probably kill yourself, the army AI of this game is so accurate, the moral is perfect, you gotta keep your troops at high moral so they do not desert your army and you end up getting wrecked by bandits and starting a whole new game.  My Experiences -   Well to start it off, bandits are the worst thing in this game, ive raged many times over them, because your troops are pretty hopeless as recruits, i try to mainly get a few troops 15-20 and head straight for a training field, so then i can get them a bit of xp and they can hold off in a fight a little longer and maybe actually win.  AND PLEASE DO NOT USE CHEATS!!!!, i have tried it once, and never again will i ♥♥♥♥en cheat, first off you can put the amount of xp, money, ability points, weapon proficiences etc to whatever you want them to be, second off you can dodge all the bandits by instantly teleporting to the position of your mouse, and then stupidest of them all you finish the bloody game in about 5 minutes and then your gonna go request a refund because you didnt even get to experience the game at its full potential.  and i have also played this game outside of steam (bought it on disk) if i had it on steam earlier i would have about 2000 hours + on this game  BUY THE GAME AND SEE FOR YOURSELF  ",

Your goal may be to terrorize villages, live as a mercenary or perhaps you prefer to serve as a Lord for your king or queen. You can do that and more in this medieval world, all from a third person perspective.  Mount and Blade allows you to recruit your own army from various kingdoms, along with special compagnions that you can grow your own way. While doing that you can travel the land choosing to gain favour in villages, cities or from lords and rulers. With patience you might even start your own kingdom. The game features real time combat where you can control your attacks using your mouse. There are a wide variety of weapons ranging from sabres, straightswords, lances, axes, polearms, javelins, shields etc. As you play you can develop your weapon skills, customize yourself with armor and choose your skills.  When you start out you will be a weak and unimportant character with no band or army to support you so you will have to head out and recruit villagers. As you fight battles against bandits and fulfill tasks for cities or lords you will soon grow your character and army to rival established lords and kings. But having a large army is not all, you can change how lords see you, improving your relationship or deteriorating it based on their personality and your actions. The more friends you make the more you increase your chances of becoming a powerful lord or ruler.   If you have finally settled into the world you can decide whether you want to join a kingdom or start your own. Once you join a kingdom you can help them fight wars, capture castles and towns or rebel against them once your ruler has done you injustice. Just make sure you are prepared before you proclaim yourself as king, before long other rulers might see you as a threat and declare war.   This game gives you a lot of freedom in what you want to do, it requires a ton of patience and many hours but all the politics and tournaments, battles and so on make this a very enjoyable game. There are too many details to explain but you can influence your army size by your own renown and skills in the land and improve your army by upgrading individual recruits, training them and so on. I started off as a 50-man mercenary army but after a few months I joined a kingdom, made a name for myself and about 1 ingame year later I have proclaimed myself as a ruler and conquered many cities, castles and villages. Now lords serve me and I am on my way to become the one true ruler of the land, ending the conflict between the existing rulers.  In short, requires patience, uses real time combat, involves thinking, planning and strategy but will provide you with a very long open game.",

Some of my recommendations and favourites are  - The Prophesy of Pensor (low fantasy, high difficulty) - Brytenwalda (Britain in the Dark Ages, improved infantry combat, Shield walls etc) - A clash of kings (Game of thrones Mod) - Floris Mod (a compilation of lots of mods to improve the native campaign)  The game is so good and is a true sandbox game no matter what mod you play or just the base game. Its all about choice, you can basically do whatever you want. Some of the things you can do include :  - You can be a merchant selling wares from one city to the next. - You can be a mercenary selling your sword and company of soldiers to different masters - You can swear fealty to any of the factions and be given lands and castles to govern. - You can start your own faction by force and become king. - you can marry for politics or love  The list could go on but the point is theres LOTS to do in this game.

            "review_text": "If you are thinking of buying this game but the dated graphics mean a deal breaker for you, then you are about to commit the biggest mistake of your life.  This is one of the best medieval combat/strategy games I have ever played.  If you’ve ever wanted to experience what it must have felt like to lead a group of men into battle to further your ambitions then this is the game for you.  You customize everything about your character including his or her physical features as well as his or her background and skills, and then quickly set off on your adventure. You’re a nobody at first and very few but the most desperate are willing to flock to your banner and cause but that quickly begins to change as you slowly but surely begin to make a name for yourself in Calradia. You get the freedom to play however you want, from becoming the loyal vassal to the king of one of the many countries in the game to a rogue bandit lord pillaging and burning his way trough everyone that crosses your path, eventually carving your own country out of blood and steel. The combat is amazing, and very responsive. It all takes place in third person so you can lead your men and fight from the front line. It might take you a little bit to get used to it since it has a bit of a curve, but once you learn it it’ll be the richest experience you’ll have. There’s a ton of community support and mods for it that are extremely varied. You can play a mod that adds a fantasy element, a mod that lets you play as a common soldier that joins up with a Lord’s army and fight for him, a mod that turns the game into the Crusades or lets you lead your own Roman Legion, or fight in Japan during the samurai era. My personal favorite has got to be the Game of Thrones: Clash of King’s mod that drops you into George R.R Martin’s Westeros during the War of the Five Kings. You can recruit men from any of the seven kingdoms or across the Narrow Sea and pledge your loyalty to any of the houses playing the game of thrones.  It’s a great game, and I cannot recommend it enough, if you’ve ever wanted to experience leading men into battle in the middle ages, feeling the exhilaration of storming a castle and putting each of it’s defenders to the sword, going from being an orphaned gutter rat to the king of the entire continent then this is the game for you.",

Lenght: Infinate  While definately entertaining, this game feels like it was never fully developed and was released in it's beta, or even alpha state. It presents a weird mix of game types, from RPG like conversations via dialogue options to Heroes of Might and Magic style overland map travelling to open combat in third person, like in Oblivion.   While this may sound great, and is infact entertaning (for a while), the game is lacking in so many departments that it's almost embarrasing. It could have been so much, but unfortunately, this is what we get.   The worst about this game, is, that it's unwinnable. There is no purpose in the game, so it's just a sandbox freeroam game with randomly generated missions and encounters. That get's old quickly.  While not a true paradox game, I can see why paradox published it. There are some similar elements. This game is extremely addicting and can feel overwhelming at times, which is what hooks the player. The potential of going from lowly peasant to ruler of an empire and the danger of losing it all even at that point.   There is so much unused potential in this game.   A new title is coming out soon, a 'sequel' of sorts, I recommend waiting for that.",

Overall Mount and blade provides decent character creation, a good amount of RPG customization (e.g. stats and skills galore) and a relatively large world to explore. The combat in Mount &amp; Blade: Warband is similar to games like the 'War of the' series (Vikings, Roses), or the Chivalry series.  The strategy and the scale of battles however are much larger. In Mount &amp; Blade; Warband, battles can have up to 250 players, so that in itself can be crazy hectic fun, and gives the multiplayer a unique edge over the rest of the games mentioned in this review. I have got to say though, if you get a chance to play any of these awesome games take it, only you will know how you feel about each game, and Mount &amp; Blade: Warband brings a unique flavor of strategy and action combat to the table.

You just have so much control over youir characters actions and overall destiny, it truly feels as though you are playing a role and not some prescripted story with some minor branching like many modern big budget RPGs.   Speaking of budgets, I guess this game didnt have one when they developed it initially, but it became immensely popular despite its myriad flaws. There is still absolutely nothing like it on the market. Armed with a bit of resources, the Warband expansion helped the developer add some graphical poilish and even more depth to the role playing as well as online multiplayer which I have not yet tried but can only imagine the insanity of.   In many ways an old school throwback game, with very little instruction given to the player and high combat difficulty (make sure you set combat to 'Normal'), this wont appeal to everyone. But for those who want a real taste of the Middle Ages, this game puts something like Assassins Creed to shame in its ambition, length, and scope.

This is one os those old games that you wish you'd found earlier. I bought this game about 3 years ago but I still create a new single player every once in a while to do enjoy the game some more. This is very open in what type of player you want to be.  Character Customization: I've created dozens of characters to try out, an incredibly strong warrior with no intelligence, a great leader who can hardly fight, multiple balanced between the two, and with variations of what weapons to use.  Gameplay: You can choose to simply be a mercenary for hire and be a key role in the warfare of any kingdom of choice, you can choose to join a kingdom and help it prosper, you can join an outcast and help them take back their land, or you can even declare war on a kingdom on your own and start your own kingdom.  My favorite reason for playing this game is having the freedom to choose just about anything. And i've chosen to only play single player, some people only play for the multiplayer and thats part of the freedom to this game. As long as the combat and managament mechanics suit you, i think anyone could enjoy this game whether they like the sp management mode or pure multiplayer combat.",

Never buy NW, since litterally everybody there is, let me put it this way. 1. Tryhards. 2. Recruiters for some god awful third world regiment. 3. ♥♥♥♥-heads. I cant say that? What kind of a world do we live in? 4. 3,000 hour trolls who decide annoying people by ♥♥♥♥ing their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s is a great way to spend their day. 5. Regiments, need I say more? 6. Actual, living and breathing, nerds. Like, I call some dude a racial slur and theres a 12% chance im getting ddosed. 7. Broken asf hitboxes. 8. 'Spin to win.' It works. Then you call them out and their only response is to say your just bad. Hilarious bait, you lowlife ♥♥♥♥♥♥s. 9. Nappy. 10. They broke the game with the update made two years ago, which completely ♥♥♥♥ed the melee system and has since destroyed all faith I had in this game. 11. By the way, im still banned from NA1 for saying '♥♥♥♥' one time? Its been a year guys, :)  Aside from all that, Viking Conquest is fine, and the mods are great. So, the only reason to buy NW, is to litterally use it for Full Invasion 2, Persistent World, or some other great mod out there. Otherwise, don't even use it. Regiments are the cancer of this community.  So yeah, buy it for mods and stuff, ♥♥♥♥♥.  By the way, just downspam, because that apparently one shots litterally every single ♥♥♥♥ing boss in the universe, as long as it directly hits their ♥♥♥♥ing dickhole.  Dont buy Napoleonic Wars, EVER.

Mods are truly the ONLY thing keeping this game alive and with the autoblockers and aimbots in multiplayer, the game's community quite toxic.   Camera, mouse movement and WASD keys are all very disconnected, blocking during combat with the mouse is a chore, needing massive amounts of input on the mouse end in order to get the correct block angle unless you have god tier gaming mouse, a good trackpad and superman reflexes or the aformentioned autoblocker program than can be found in 5 minutes with google. On very populated servers, you can often often chamber an attack in one direction, only to swing the opposite way or in a way not intended, sometimes striking your teammates. Decent gameplay if you stay off of the multiplayer component and can deal with terrible graphics even by 2006 standards. 6/10 if you can get it on sale.",

            "review_text": "EDIT: Downloaded mods. I WAS SO WRONG.  EDIT: Played this game again....  I tried to get into this game, really really hard. I will admit that it isn't good for the first 5-6 hrs but can you really blame me for quitting? Although the mods are great, the singleplayer is kind of dull. Let me explain.  Most of the singleplayer has you running around and doing favors or quests for the Nobles and Lords around the area. However, sometimes you'll be doing the same quests over and over and/or just hunting down the bandits in your way. As much as I really wanted to get into the game it takes a LONG time to build a good enough army to handle your own kingdom. While I do understand that you just have to be extremely dedicated to doing the same tasks for the same lords and nobles of the area. The thing is, I want to like this game, but I can never dedicate myself the hundreds of hours of time required.  Don't get me wrong, it's not that I am not into these games. I guess it's because I've played this game before: Feudalism 1&amp;2 which is a flash game. Basically the flash version of this game. Feudalism just felt a whole lot more organized and less messy or random. While MB has a lot of features that the flash game rip-off didn't have, it still doesn't make up for the problems it has. Such as traveling. Traveling in this game is much more complicated, slow, and probably worse than the flash game. Traveling in Feudalism was quick, but provided the risk of running into bandits. Traveling in M&amp;B provided the risk of fighting a superior force, but while traveling is risky it can end up being costly and wasting your time. Sure, there's a risk and a challenge but when you invest all that gold and time into getting your armour, weapons, companions and army... aaand it's gone. There will be times when you will HAVE to fight mounted ronin raiding the area and there is no way you could've ran away. It becomes a grindfest trying to get it all back, it's like rolling a boulder up a hill only to have it roll over the other side.  The quests are either incredibly boring or they will sometimes be too tough for you to handle. If you want to speed up the game, the game sees it as a cheat so you have to configure that in the launcher, which is annoying. Bandits that run around will be either 10 or so men or 30-50 men. Countless times I've lost an entire army to these fights and keeping only the elite veterans and even then... even then those fights don't give back the money you've lost.  The combat is nice, and commanding your men is awesome. The game can be a cluster♥♥♥♥ though, and just numbers will win outright most of the time. My problem isn't the combat, but rather just the singleplayer experience. Doing quests and favors for lords can be boring, tedious and if you haven't played the game before you won't know where to find a certain criminal or bandit party. Sometimes you don't really know what to do other than a vague description.  So, why is it this important? Because leveling up doesn't feel very rewarding or great. Yeah you get a few points for your stats, but the fact that you have to tediously grind bandits, do boring quests, quests you don't know what you're supposed to do (until you look up a ♥♥♥♥ing guide) or tasks that are impossible to do at low levels... It doesn't feel great, at all. It doesn't feel good looking in the store staring at the armor and weapons I can never buy because everytime I build an army it gets killed by bandits, then I have to build it up again if I want to stay alive, it's slow and I can't advance forward to being a Lord or a peasant that grew up to take over the Kingdom.  I feel like feudalism was a better game. The items and abilities you could get if you played enough, the awesome looking armor and the special troops you can recruit for conquering certain towns. The items for sale in M&amp;B feel like random items pop up when I'm in a town. Certain weapons or armor sometimes disappear from shops (replaced by other items) so I can't buy them and I have to travel to another town. The Lords and Ladies of the land don't seem to have different personalities (they all basically say the same thing and do the same thing) and towns don't seem to be varied at all (Like having certain swords or armour for sale or different towns breeding different types of horses, etc.)  So, I bought the Napoleonic wars dlc and yeah I don't really feel that dignified getting it. I did it for the MP since that's all it seems that everyone plays and it's absolutely nothing like I expected it would be. No teamwork or formations, no organized charges, just a bunch of guys shooting and stabbing each other haha. Sadly, I kind of think Chivalry: Medieval Warfare does a better job at that as much as I'd hate to admit it.  Is it worth the money? At full price? No. Buy it during steam sale.",

This is going to look like one of those reviews where the guy writing the review has several thousand hours in the game yet he's talking about how bad the game is...  This is technically a terrible game. Models, textures, UI, writing, animations, programming, controls... All terrible. (The music is fine although a bit low on quantity. Gotta give'm that.)  What makes this game so appealing for all of us that plays this game is what it features. It's a game that lets you go out, build an army from nothing, use that army to either side with a Kingdom of your choice or murder anyone in your way to have political importance in the continent as you capture forts and cities.  You build up your own character much like in any other RPG by levelling up certain stats and gathering better equipment over time. But when in a fight, the game almost has this RTS feel to it where you command your army as you march in front of them.   Or actually, in the middle of them. Getting bodyblocked by your troops. Every... Time...    You can witness armies with hundreds of men clash and fight to capture a fort. It geniunely feels amazing and makes you forget about how incredibly poorly developed this game is.  So, yeah. If you're into the type of game that I explained in the three pharagraphs above this one, this game is your best bet until a new and well developed game comes out.

I have always loved the idea of rising to the top as 1 person and being just that 1 person on the battlefield as a commander, so that made me wanna try mount and blade warband a lot.  When you first start this game out it will probably give you quite a hard time since the tutorial barely explains anything to you or give you any indications as to what you should do next, but thats the beauty of it, if you push through that rough patch at the beginning with barely any money, weak fighters, bad equipment and everybody looking down on you it will become great... let me rephrase that even the phase were everything you have sucks is great, but it will get better if you push through that.  After grinding quests from lords, villages and cities for a while and killing looters, sea raiders, steppe bandits etc you will be looking to get an enterprise ( a steady income for you so you can pay for your group of soldiers ) and from then on you can probably start out being a mercenary shifting the land to your favour.  You can help the nords defend against the veigirs or help out the sarranids against the khergit khanate and all that good stuff.  To sum up the good things and worse things about the games I will just make a pro's and cons list.  Pro's:  - The game is absorbing and interesting - The gameplay is good on the map its just pointing and clicking and the combat feels fluid and great - if you like medieval settings ( dont confuse this with fantasy ) this is the game for you  Cons:  - I can look past this personally, but the graphics aren't really all that great certainly not bad, but not great - Can be really frustrating when you lose your soldiers and your companions start leaving because you lose them ( which is the beauty of the game and this could be a pro aswell as a con ).  Cant think of any other cons right now though  Conclusion: just buy the game.",

            "review_text": "Lets face it, anyone who plays this game forgets about the graphics and gets immersed in the game. massive battles and bloody sieges make up the game. Other elements come into play adding to the feeling of leading a warband. While you may choose the life of a barbarian, political nature sits very nicley in this game as well.  WOuld love to have a more immersive story for the game however seeing as this is more of a true RPG, i can live without it. If noticed and given a chance, this game style of revolutionary possibilities could take over several genres and develop into something greater than we could ever hope for.  Definatley could add dungeons(bandit caves and such)   the expansions such as viking conquest were all together another revolution that were gifts i had asked for a very long time. The story that followed that was distinct and left many craving more as it changed how you originally played the game. Plus the historical aspects that the game had made things very intersting as well. Sailing and vicking battles brought the game to a new level assailing across the world could bring you fortune, or slavery to yourself and your men.  THough simple combat, it was often entertainng. though i could easily see the combat engine getting a complete over haul in the next and coming games. Such as different movements or even something as simple as rolling. climbing up small obsticle would be another great addition.   THe mods, god some are pretty weird, but others... i forget that im playing mount and blade with the overhauls and additions with charecters, wepaons, soldiers and factions. SOme even have stories that can catch your eye.   PROS  -open world -tons of weapons -easily modable with a variety of options -unique and massive battles -revolutionary gameplay -politcal and economic elements -the obvious VIKING CONQUEST element that added so meny great things to the game.  -the ships(customization and quanity)  -the new interface menu for towns.  -again the story option! LOVED IT! &lt;3  -definatly the make your own little base option, and the many small places to visit  -Ponies, not in that other sense, but the one where i can ride a small furball into battle.  -hello, VIKING?  -other ways to earn small amounts of cash. -easily become the most hated person in the game after conquering a region and nameing it Petoria.    CONS (not complaining really, just things that caught my eye in a negative way. love the game either way.)  -obviously needs updated graphics. -Better managment of the fiefs and army(mainly more options for the fiefs i.e simple walls or small destructable envierments. army wise wold be color of uniforms and definatley a way to make your own banners without the use of modding) -music was often to repetative, nice but a need for possibly a few more scours. -needs more elements as simple as more maps, possbly even a map generater similar to CIV. Though would need the addition of the ships from viking conquest. -castles were a little plain on the inside as well as the feasts. -maybe more imersive conversations, the ending of 'very good' seemed a little weird. -sometimes a repetative AI, though it can be funny sometimes. Every charecter is the same size... every guy is built the same way, same for the girls. Is Caladria made up of clones? 0.o -only option is to use one mod at a time... i have so many i like! why cant they all be used at the same time!   RECOMENDATIONS (things i personally selfishly would like to see in the coming game.)  -possible DLC for building your own castle. Nothing too immersive, but enough that each castle could be unique and different sizes. -definatley a customization option for the character. -possibly change in the way you say things, liek options in the beggining, Cocky, Prude, Intelligent, Charasmatic, Barbaric, comidiac, ect. -needs more elements as simple as more maps, possbly even a map generater similar to CIV. Though would need the addition of the ships from viking conquest. (i know it was a copy and paste comment but it fit both bills.)  -Fog of war, always fun when discovering new parts of the map.  -Ability to build your own castle as mentioned before but also forts and watch towers.  -Definatley other building options, bazars, levels of farns, castle defenses, forges, craftng houses, even personal guilds for your castle (oooh maybe even make a guild as an option of route for your charecter!) -Dungeons! Dungeons DUNGEONS!! for the army aspect you can pre set up or change as you enter the dungeon a small team to go with you. BUT seriously lets get some dungeon dwelling in!  -maybe a little body modification in? okay perverted ideas out, i just would like to see some people shorter than me or taller, some brawny and others smaller. -random events like forest fires or sandstorms or even icy blizzards to affect you and your army.

            "review_text": "Tl;dr version: Your money or your life!  Note: The pros and cons are mainly based on the singleplayer. Some things about the multiplayer near the end.  Pros: - Has a lot of depth to the game.  -Your decisions for the most part matter. One example is like choosing whenever or not to release a lord, or take him prisoner when you defeat him. This can lead him to like you more, or dislike, depending on your decisions. You can't always choose the simpliest option.  -You are right there in the thick of the battle or sitting in the back commanding your troops as they take to the field against the enemy (which can range from several guys to a full on army).  -The open world map is large, with multiple areas to fight in. On the open world map, everyone is either running around, sitting on their ♥♥♥ doing absolutely nothing, or constantly picking fights with each other. It's overall chaotic in the world of Calradia, but you just can't see it (unless you use cheats). Not the greatest looking overworld/map, but it's not that bad.  -The combat is quite fluid and satisfying. Using the mouse to swing and block in four directions is simple and fun. If you are going to play the singleplayer, then do it right. Go to your options, turn the damage of you and your allies to normal, turn off auto block, and experience Warband with all of it's ups and downs :)  -Become the king/queen of Calradia. Who wouldn't want to become one? Just make sure to keep in the realm in check or else you might have some problems on your hands.  -Tons of mods to choose from, although the Vanilla game can last you for a very long time. and other such things  -Pretty good music. Fits the game.  Cons: -Not the greatest looking game. If you are looking for graphics, then this isn't the game to look for.  -There isn't really a story. You basically create your own story/background and then thrown into the world of Calradia, where 6 different factions fight for control over the realm.  -Can get quite repetitive, since all you are doing for the most part when it comes to the gameplay, is running around on the overworld, and fighting other parties.  -Has no real tutorial, and does not tell you about what it has within the game. Basically you need to either look up a guide or explore the game in-depth, in order to figure out what the game has to offer. Don't be to suprised if you've missed something or experienced something new after hours of playing the game.  -Siege battles are not great. Definitely not the strongest part about the game.  -Getting knocked out isn't fun. Neither is being taken prisoner (since you cannot die). Try and not get screwed over, or you will be put in a rather bad position.  -You may get graphical issues with the game, like having part of the overworld turning into a blue sky. It isn't game breaking, but can be kind of annoying.     All of that was, for the most part, the singleplayer part of Warband. The multiplayer:  -Involves the combat system like the singleplayer, but with other players (obviously). It can be a blast, and quite chaotic if you can get on the populated servers. Watching 30 players charge into another 30 is quite a beautiful sight to behold, wouldn't you agree?  -Having a few men and woman swinging away in their undergarments is entertaining to watch. Especially if those players are wrecking ♥♥♥♥ :)    What else is there to say about this wonderful game? The combat is smooth, the gameplay is fun, there is alot to do in it, the multiplayer is chaotic, and the only thing lacking is a basic tutorial and not so good graphics. The pros heavily outweigh the cons and the only reason why you shouldn't buy it is because it isn't your game. So yeah, it's pretty much a must buy.  Still holds up well for an old game.",

It's not all sword and blood in Calradia, up-and-coming heroes with short arms and long pockets can also dabble in the seedy world of economics with trading, purchasing industries and upgrading their properties.  Socialite? Intrigue and deceit await you in the halls of powerful rulers, making friends, marrying elegible nobles and backstab until you reach the top!  The down side? Multiplayer can be entertanining if you can find a properly administered server. A flimsy vote system, easy-to-exploit crutch mechanics and scarcity of world-wide servers can make the multiplayer experience an excersice in futility.  Warband may lack the finesse and depth of big developer titles, but has laid a solid foundation for better future development.",

You can organize your forces into Infantry, Archers, and Cavalry. think theres no tactics to warband? get your archers into position and hold fire untill the right moment to watch your enemys advance crumple under the weight of sustained volleys of fire, before watching your cavalry close in and smash whats left into paste. Lead an ordered charge with spear, lance, mace, sword, axe, 2h sword, 2h axe, bows, xbows, staves, and im probably forgetting more! You can be a bandit, you can be a noble, you can be a trader, you can have your own kingdom won through bloodshed and heroism. become rich through treachery, pillaging and looting. you can do whatever you want. warband is my personal favorite game of all time for so many reasons, and for the current price, theres no reason not to support these amazing devs. 10 out of 10",

The most appreciable fact is that there have been so much improvements yet the game still can be played even on cheap computers. Not to mention the brand new approach to medieval warfare, which wasn't common at the moment when this game was released for the first time. Some people compare this to hardcore simluations like Total War. However, I think it's a different story. Players like me who love the games with authentic taste but don't really enjoy games with steep learning curve would love this sort of game. This is one of few games that I really adore.",

Another few slashes and I've made a big enough space for the men following me to flow onto the walls as we slaughter every man and take the Lord of the castle captive.  The first stand-alone expansion to Mount and Blade, Warband is a free-roaming, horse-riding, medieval RPG. Making an army, conquering towns, and doing quests for your Lords and Ladies are the brunt of what you will be doing in Mount and Blade: Warband.  You can also dabble a bit in setting up trade routes, creating your own stores, and ruling over a fiancial empire, but I much prefer an empire filled with battle.  Don't bother with the next expansion, Fire &amp; Sword. Stick to Warband. It's the best game in the series.",

(to be continued) Quests you can't finish. How the damn hell is it MY fault that you were dumb enough to get captured by the enemy, thus eliminating my chances of finishing the quest you gave me?? (for example: provide me with x amount of a certain troop type).  Damaging relations for refusing quests you couldn't possibly win. (eg: My small army of 50 moves fairly slowly, stop giving me tracking down missions...)  um... mediocre graphics....and.. um... peasants repeat lines.  The good...it's all good.  The negatives I mentioned only affect you if you want to impress local lords early on and align yourself with a kingdom (which, LOL, turns out to be a mistake).  Trade is simple and straight-forward. Buy here, sell there... Starting businesses is easy, but expensive. So win some tournaments!... Tournaments are unique to the region you are in (so is the arena) and the pay is quite decent. Combat can be adjusted to suit you. AI difficulty, blocking mechanics, attack mechanics etc. Find what works for you, and you will decimate all.   Overwhelming, this game really is. You start off as a nobody. (To borrow someone else's words) you are not the Dragon-Born, you are not The Witcher, you are not Neo.  If you want something, you need to take it. You want military dominance? Then you need to raise and train your army. Trade? You need to do a lot of travelling. etc.  This game also has no clear-cut objective, you can literally spend your entire time playing on your own wasting time.   So decide your path and what kind of person you want to be. Play to those desires and everything will be pretty :-) ",

As a character you trade in goods which include the usual garbage RPGs deal in; food, weapons, armour, gold, frankincense and myrrh. But also beasties of an equestrian persuasion which you can ride depending on your riding skill obviously. This makes getting about way faster which does make a dfference on the war map when you become tin soldier in scale and hurry about as the cosmic fluctuation in light levels tell you day and night are passing as your tiny horse dances along between the province capitals. And in battle when you charge the enemy and slap the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s away you feel alot more powerful too (This is the mount bit). Then you gather men around you to be able to hold your own in a fight as well as leveling up yourself, meaning you can take on larger groups of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s (this is the band bit). You see mount and band, the war blade bit just sounds right to me. Screw it! The title is irrelevant this is a unique and addictive RPG, one could write stories based on the military adventures your avatar can partake in here. It can be a slog though and I'm not talking about the creatures in Oddworld. Warband is a hefty brute and requires attention to detail, patience and guile. If your level or the difficuly is high you might get maimed. The game has options to escape capture sometimes when you lose a fight but this means getting away from your captors on the war map and reasembling an army just to cover yourself. Evading fast travelling squads is harder if you have no horse, but generally as a rule the larger the force is the slower it is, ergo you can skirt arround larger armies too big to combat successfully. The combat here is fun though, I just suited my guy up with knight armour and a massive cleaver or axe and went to town on my opponant. Riding into war is particularly high on the agenda. Many armies are large in size often dwarfing your own, but when you rally under the king you follow whole sieges are won with you and your men in the ranks. When the day is finally yours everyone cheers like off a scene from a period movie. There is alot to balance here but this guy (Me) had a good time playing warband leading to a solid 8/10 the repetition gets a little boring after a while.

Well, there's no magic, and it's not quite that simple.  Mount and Blade: Warband is the expansion, if you will, of the original M&amp;B, where the primary difference being that you can command a party as small as Robin Hoods band of Merry Men to a massive army boasting over a thousand troops (hope you have enough resources to support that). This series is the epitamy of roleplay, where you can be anything from a humble peasant, to the greatest master of trade, to a greedy mercenary, to the damned king/queen (yes, you can play a girl). The game runs along the feudal system of the medieval age, where if you don't have a d*ck in your pants and nobility to your name and blood, you're essentially nobody (it doens't go quite that far, but you'll be surprised at how tough it is). Now, the base game is good and is fun to play, but the real beauty of this title are in the mods, and if you don't play at least one mod, you're not doing it right. Mods expand the game and add new roleplaying abilities to the game. My personal favorites are A Clash of Kings (A Game of Thrones mod, albeit, it's taxing, buggy, and the developer is one of the unfriendliest humans ever) and Brytenwalda (turns the world into a historically accurate 6th century or whatever United Kingdom gripped by all-out war), and I usually play as a bloodthirsty mercanary or a bandit king/queen (playing women is so fun). Never shy away from a commoner's background or to play a female, because that's when the game gets interesting. So strap on your sword belt, sharpen your blade, and mount your horse, it's time to enter the world of Warband.",

Pros: The combat is very hard to master, especially ranged combat, but works well. Quests add replayability to the game and, while side quests, they add to the main storyline which is whatever you want it to be. The flexibility of a Choose Your Own Adventure allows you to play without walls and major restrictions, so you can be as evil or as nice as you want to. The level system allows you to make your character how you want it to be, and you can change from full agility to full strength if you wish. You can't perfect everything without major grinding, and this makes the game challenging. The game has modules that is Workshop supported, meaning this game is heavily reliant on mods, my favourite being Perisno. The modules represent what type of game you play in Warband, the default and main game being 'Native.' The modules add nice campaigns, weapons, characters, and multiplayer aspects. The DLC is 100% not needed, but adds a lot of content if you wish to buy it, notably in the Multiplayer section of the game. The characters, while bland, add to the story and are actually important unlike some RPG NPCs, which are more one-off. This is because relations are very important to getting a higher standing in the realm, so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ off one guy might ♥♥♥♥ off a lot more of his fellow brethren in his faction, and this can put you at a disadvantage.  Cons: The game loses saves via corrupt files too often, and is too common of an issue to ignore completely. Sometimes this can be avoided by saving multiple times, but if that's something that is required, it cannot be discounted and is definitely a detriment to the game. Arena and Tournaments are sometimes lost by scenarios that are out of your control, such as getting a bow and arrow in Arena with 5 guys teaming up to concuss you, and by your teammates fighting 2 lots of 4v8's in an 8v8v8 Tournament round and losing all of them, leaving you to be the sole remaining person on your team. Quests are often lost due to phantom events, such as a Jarl requiring your assistance in battle within 5 days but appearing on the opposite side of the map in the space of one day. You cannot alt-tab in fullscreen without auto pausing the game while in the party map (i.e. travelling with your party to somewhere on the map, which is your way of traversing the world in game).  Overall, I rate this game 7.5/10. Discounting the few lost saves that ruined the experience a few times, it is probably a 9/10. Mods are endless and make this game one that could easily be played for 1000 hours. The Native module is also endlessly replayable, and these things make M&amp;B:W probably the best all-around RPG on Steam at the moment.",

Its historicly accurate as far as the politics and culture goes. for example you do have the option to play a female charecter but its extremly difficult to become a vassal, or to own a feifdom. the charecter creation really impressed me. you choos multiple aspects of your charecters background (which determins a few base stats and some of your starting items/gear). the model options are a bit lacking but considering how cheap the game is i wasnt dissapointed. the map for the game is huge, and i dont even have any of the expansions yet. So far the only things i dislike about the game is how blatantly overpowered any calvalry unit is. unless you want a serious challenge you pretty much never want to be near the kergit khanate early in the game because alot of the regions bandits are horsemen. and you pretty much lose every fight even if you have double troops. Ive also had minor graphical errors (mostly with the water on the world map). All in all this game is a great buy if your into mideval style games.

You create your character, give him a character background and lead him onto the battlefield. As if management and battle wasn't enough for your medieval tastes, there is the option to marry noble ladies, get in good with local lords and even (if you work hard at it) work your way to becoming king of a land. Going over all these little details will quickly see you playing the game for whole days at a time. Most importantly however, it is just very fun!

This one has it all, weapons physics (attacks actually do different damage based on direction of swing and your velocity relative to the target), RPG-style skill improvement, a colorful cast of NPCs, an (admittedly rudimentary) trade economy, an interesting setting with multiple factions, diverse troop-types, and a completely open-ended sandbox world. Do you want to earn glory and lands serving a noble liege? Become kingmaker in a bloody civil war? Declare your own claim to the throne and conquer the world? Just ride around plundering caravans? All of the above are possible.  The only downsides are the graphics (not bad when the game came out but a bit dated now), the rather weak AI (pitched battles tend to have the tactical depth of a soccer game with 5-year-old kids where everyone converges on the same point and starts hitting each other), and a repetitive late-game (the early game is very fun and interesting, the late game is still challenging but you end up fighting a plethora of siege battles on the same castle map again and again).

The closest thing to finishing the game is taking over the world known as Calradia, for yourself or a faction of your choosing. The idea of the game is basically, raise a company of troops, take as many places for yourself and make lots of cash, and it's lots of fun.   You start the main game by picking your backstory/background, depeding on your choices you will begin with different items, cash, skills and attributes. After this you get a screen where it shows your skills and attributes, and gives you some points to improve these, this is also where you name your charcater. Next you will be presented with a character customisation screen where you will pick how you look. You are then dumped in an alley and left to fend of a robber. Afterwards, (whether successful or not) you will find yourself talking to a merchant of the city, and he will offer you a simple starter quest to get you started.  After this you are released the world, you can hunt bandits, join a kingdom (or maybe start your own), and grab quests from the various importqant people around the land. It is not a good idea to do this alone however and you are expected to hire some troops and keep them well fed and payed in return for them helping you not be a prison ♥♥♥♥♥ the whole game.  Now thats what you do in the game and how they do it is good too. You basically have an overworld map where you wil lead yourself and your party into groups of people and locations where you will be presented with menues and a chance to walk around. The field battles are good and the seiges are... well quite messy but can still be fun! The controls go along the lines of easy to learn hard to master, and there are tutorials for combat and such.   Anyways i haven't gone into great depth but i have given you enough information to make your mind up about the game, and if not theres a demo of it to try. If you enjoy this game you will also find a great modding community that will expand the games life tenfold.

In Warband you take the role of.. well, honestly, whomever you want to be.   Do you want to gather up your army and roll around the map killing bandits or burninating the peasants? Or would you rather pledge yourself to one of the many kingdoms and become a lord? Maybe you'd prefer to aid one of the pretenders onto the throne in a grand coup, or even go entirely independant and forge your own glorious empire?   All of this and more is possible in warband, but the really interesting thing is how the game actually plays. Initially you cruise around a campaign map, in the style of older RPGs. However, when you enter a battle, the fun begins. Yes, you have your own army, and you can give them tactical orders, much like Total War. The unique thing here is that you don't take the role of some sort of omnipotent flying general; you are in the battle itself, in a 1st person perspective.  Combat itself is fairly satisfying- attacks are made by left clicking, with the direction of the swing determined by your mouse movement. Likewise, parrying is directional, and requires fairly precise timing. Enemies can be caught offguard with a swift kick, but bear in mind that this will also leave you vulnerable for a short time. Advanced players can also feint, changing the direction of the swing at the last second.  However, it isn't all hitting peasants with swords. The variety of weapons available is massive and includes: swords, axes, clubs, warhammers, knives, halbards, polearms, spears, lances, javelins, bows, crossbows, throwing knives, throwing axes, and more. Of all the different combat styles, I found lancing and horse archery the most satisfying. Lancing as heavy cavalry is huge fun- get up some speed and charge at a knot of infantry and you become and unstoppable juggernaut, skewering foes like so many kebabs. Horse archery is probably the most difficult playstyle, but also the most rewarding- travelling at speed on a horse affects different weapons signifcantly- it'll impart momentum to melee swings, allowing you to lop off heads with axes as you charge, and projectiles will also inherit your velocity. As such, arrows won't go where you expect them to, until you get used it it.  Graphically, the game isn't brilliant, but it's functional. There are numerous graphics enhancing mods around that help with this. Speaking of the mods, the modding scene for this is fairly massive, and there are some mods and modpacks around that really change the game. The best of these is probably the Floris pack, however, I've had issues running it with the steam version.  tl;dr: very much worth buying, but only if you're prepared to sink a lot of time into it",

I assured her that I would put a stop to it. I would talk with him during the break-out. I continued journeying to the castle. I disguised myself and stuck into the castle walls. Feeling pretty good. Knocked out the prison guard and stole his keys. Got into the prison. Before we left the prison to try to escape the castle, I told him about his lies against my friend. He challenged me to a duel, inside the prison. I win the fight, and he surrenders to my valiant heart. Knowing he is already weak and malnourished, I tell him to wait while I fight off the castle guards. I grab my axe about the size of a large lance, and proceed to slice the guards in half as they charge down the narrow stairwell. We succesfully escaped the castle. The wife thanks me multiple times, and pays me enough money to recruit a small army.  This is now my life every day. Never going to do real life again.",

This is a game set in a medieval environment where you start as a freelancer and get to fight for or against 6 different factions who have very different troop trees and ways of fighting. Wide variety of different weapons to play with and if Native gets too boring or easy for you there's a wide variety of mods like Floris, Nova Aetus, Gekokujou, Brytenwalda, Pendor, Perisno, Light and Darkness (the only mod with a story that I know of so far), and many more. There are also several good mods that are still in development like Silverstag and L'aigle (this is a mod that takes place in the Napoleonic Wars) that you can count on being good once they're complete. If medieval combat sounds interesting to you then this is the game for you.  Two things of note is that while most computers that aren't 7-8 or more years old can run Native, many mods improve the textures which is great if you have a relatively more modern PC (not a gaming rig, but something that's decent by the standards of around 4-5 years ago) but a computer that could barely run Native might not be able to run a mod that's more graphically intense like Floris. Also, spears are rather weak in this game since the face-hugging AI will get right up next to you making it practically impossible to hit them (you can try thrusting your spear in a slightly different direction from the enemy and then immediately re-direct the thrust to the enemy once the spear is moving). I can see this being annoying to spear fans and HEMA enthusiasts but...nothing can be perfect. Although, in Viking Conquest, spears get a new overhand thrust (you can do it the same way you'd do an overhand swing with a sword, by moving the mouse up before clicking the attack button) that will hit an enemy no matter how close they are.",

Or, go all Evil and raid Villages, attack innocent Farmers, harass Merchant Carvans and being a total Jerk.  You can also sell your sword (or whatever weapon you wish to use) to one of the many factions in the game, 6 in total, who are all competing for complete dominance in the land of Calradia.  Firstly, we have the Kingdom of Nords. The Nords are Vikingish people who majorly rely on their Heavy Infantry, the Nordic Huscarls. In my opinion, thease are the BEST (and I mean the BEST) infantry units that you could possibly get. Their position in Calradia, is in the North West. A word of warning, even though this faction is pretty much the faction that all beginners will join, the game is made to have this faction ALWAYS, ALWAYS, trying to be at war with any faction. One time when I was playing with them, they were at war with EVERY SINGLE OTHER FACTION in the game! I couldn't even leave a city without being attacked by another faction.  Secondly, we have the Kingdom of Vaegirs. Russiany Axe Wielding, Bow using merry men who live in the Snowy areas of Calradia. Along with a few villages and a city of the Nords, they are terrorised by Sea Raiders, who plague the Coasts. Becareful when fighting them, as they are the strongest, and most dangerous bandits you can run into in this game, but also carry some AMAZING start loot, and can be used to XP farm for your men. The Vaegirs also boast the Best Archers in the game, the Vaegir Marksman, who's only possible equals are the Sarranid Bow Masters, who we will get to later. This factions position, is in the North East.  Thirdly, the Kingdom of Swadia. A mix between English and possible French, who are in the very middle of Calradia. In my opinion, they are a faction I would not choose to join, because due to the fact that they are at war, any faction they go to war with, will be right next to them, meaning you would not get a break, unlike the Nords, who if they were at war with the Rhodoks, would get some breathing room, as they would be a kingdom away from them. The Swadians also have the Best, but most expensive, Cavalry in the game. The powerful Swadian Knights! The Sarranid Mamlukes (who we will get to later) can also possibly give the Knights a good challenge.  Fourthly, the Kingdom of Rhodoks. They have the same origins as the Swadians. They rebelled against the Swads and founded their own Kingdom in the mountains. They are a nice beginner starting area, and possibly a very nice faction to join, as long as they are fighting in their own land. Their position is in the South West of Calradia, in the Mountains. They have the strongest crossbowmen, and have some very decent infantry, who mainly carry Spears. The Rhodok Seargent (Sorry if that is spelt incorrectly) may be the Second best Infantry, if not the third. Their Crossbowmen, the Rhodok Sharpshooter, is the best Crossbowmen in the game, beating the Swadian Crossbowmen. A mix with their Crossbowmen, along with some Vaegir Marksman and Nordic Huscarls, could become the strongest force in Calradia, especially if mixed with some Swadian Knights and a few Sarranid And Khergit Cavalry. Also, like the Nords and Vaegirs, are under siege by some powerful Bandits, the Mountain Bandits, who do have some annoying units, but also have some nice loot and can be used to get some early starting XP.  Now to the Sarranid Sultanate. Deserty people who have some very nice Cavalry and Archers. They are in the South East part of Calradia. Just look at the Deserts and you will see them. You could say that their Mamlukes are equal with the Swadian Knights, and are better than those knights, as the Mamlukes cost less to pay for. The Sarranid Master Archers are also the second best Archers in the game, with the Vaegir Marksman being the first. Their special bandits are the Desert Bandits. Horse Riding, Lance wielding people who are very annoying, especially when you have a poorly equipped and upgraded bunch of soldiers. They can be used to get a nice bit of XP, but their loot in not impressive.  Finally, we come to the Khergit Khanate. People who possibly take after the likes of Ghenghis Khan (I think so, and no racism is meant). Mostly all their units are horse riders, so getting across Calradia, and the battlefield, will be no problem. They mainly rely on their Bows and Lances, and are horrible when attacking a Castle or Town, so becareful when using them when on the attacking side of a siege. They are also in the middle of Calradia, but just a little to the right. Honestly, I would not join them, because if you are attacking a well equipped army of Rhodoks (which most games I have had, the Khergs and Rhods are at war) your Lancers could be decimated by their Spears, and any remaining units would be shot down by their Crossbowmen. The special bandits that are in their lands, are the Steppe bandits. Like the Desert Bandits, they ride horses and a quite a few may use Lances, but most of them will be using Bows  So in the end, the faction of choice is yours.   In Conclusion, I find this game highly addicting and enjoyable. The only downside, is that it may take time to get to know how to play this properly. But trust me, once you get to know how to play, you will be playing it A LOT!",

            "review_text": "An excellent sandbox rpg game. Game lacks superior graphics in today's world, but makes up for it in immersive gameplay. Start out as a nobody, then rise and become king! You recruit men in your party, battle other regiments, and gain xp, gold, loot -- albeit, not with magical properties or extreme value -- and level up. And it gets better... You can upgrade your units so that they become stronger.  One cool concept about the game is the relations. You build prestige or hate with nobles, or factions, and can earn fiefs, or towns that you earn money from, and can garrison troops. You can even rob other nobles, and start wars with other factions. (Do not recommend this if you have a low reputation with your liege king) Even in the boring stage, you can hire heroes other than yourself, get married, learn poems, and trade.  One downside is the parallelogram of gameplay. Sometimes, it gets too repetitive. But, ignoring that if you can, it is very enjoyable.  There is multiplayer in this, but I have not played it, so look to other reviews for more info.  The game too hard? No problem. Just increase the portion of damage enemies can give you. (This works in reverse, too) Too small a battle? Done. Just increase the battle size to pit your 100 against their 100 instead of a 20 to 20. The AI too predictable? Increase AI difficulty. (Tactics wise, it does get tricky in battle.) Also, when doing this, don't attempt to eviscerate 10 archers with just a two-handed blade. It goes south pretty fast.  Dozens of mods to choose from without having to spend 15$ on a half-asser DLC.  10/10. GET THAT GAME. I MEAN IT.",

Start out with one main character, gather your companions armies, befriend lords and court ladies, and then strive to become the richest merchant, the most brutal lord, or the scourge of the world. You must have quick reflexes and a patient demeanor though, else you find yourself in a prison for a week and lose all your abilities. Warband is fun and addictive on easy mode and unforgiving on hard, so it is a welcome to causual and experienced players; the relatively low graphics of the game make it laptop friendly. Plus, the game is steam-workshoppable, so many users have recreated vastly different scenarios -- from Gekokujo (war for Japan's Shogunate of 1500s) to the American Civil War to The War of the Five Kings (A Game of Thrones). This makes the game's replayability high and enjoyable. I recommend Warband to anyone who loves adventure and rpgs with a little dash of strategy.",

To all that comes the option to upgrade yourself and your heroes, awesome combat style adaptable to your playstyle and much more..

Centered in the room -- a large table spread with an elegant dinner fixed fresh by the many servants of the king. Smiles and stories of conquest wasp through the air with the smells of roast pork and fresh breads.  And here am I, amid lord and lady, a son from no noble birth. I was a studied lad in my youth, but intellect makes no matter in turning a lord from a peon. Still, I've served under my liege, King Harlaus, for near a full turn of the seasons. I had proven myself to him through simple errands and by winning a tournament not unlike the one we had participated in on this day.  Proud of myself and my accomplishments, my reward thus far has been two small fiefs. Despite them, my Lady Sondel, the one who holds my heart, seeks a man of true endeavor. I must make more of myself. I want a castle, or something more than simple peasant villages. Though I try my best to care for them, they are too often raided by the enemies of my king. He calls me to battle upon which my return is met with ashes and death.  There was a rumor of one such raider. A certain Lord Crahask.   Now, here's where things get interesting...  I stand amid this cheery and bubbly room of richly garbed lords and nobles, only to sight Lord Crahask in the distance. After saying my words to Lady Sondel, the only other person I truly cared to see, I turn and approach the honorless Lord. This fool is no longer an enemy. He fights for my King. Upon starting conversation, the brigand immediately condemns me for my courtship of Lady Sondel and a clear rift forms between he and I. Previously, I thought my grudge was merely one-sided, but now I know more. He tells me of his own long pursuit for the hand of Lady Sondel. In an attempt to avoid more confrontation, I decide to move from that conversation, give my farewells to Lady Sondel, then venture from the castle. Perhaps a walk will cool me down.  While sauntering along the dirt paths within the keep, I turn to a quieter area away from the bustle of the shops. I hear the sliding of metal across scabbard and the disgruntled arguing of common scum. A group of five men pull bows or swords from their backs and ready themselves against me.   *What is the meaning of this!?* I think to myself.  I press back around a wall and aim my bow at one and take him down with two arrows under his shield. By then, two others had closed in and I pull my sword from its sheath. The first blow I dodge with a back-step. I lunge in only to have my attack deflected and the man at his side begins to lunge in at his advantage. I pull back and lift my shield to glance off one, then another attack from either man. I see an opening and swing my blade, a hit, a block, then another swing and the man crumples before me. Now, one man is no match for my swordsmanship. I dismiss his life to the floor and head to the street corner wall I had moved behind. When I look out, I see the other two men with bows and arrows at the ready. I ready my own and poke my head out once again. *Zip*, *clack*. An arrow finds its way past my side and into the stones of the wall behind me. I notch my arrow, aim, loose. The shaft of the arrow visibly vibrates as the first archer's skull lurches back, arrow embedded in its depth. The second archer loosed two more arrows in my direction, but my own two met his chest.   I decide to search the bodies and come upon 500 denars.   Hm... Perhaps a payment from someone who wants me dead. The timing is truly impeccable.",

There is a certain satisfaction that this game gives you that I have yet to see in other games (Watching a horse rider topple from his mount when you hit him vitally with an arrow or javelin, Or charging full speed and landing a mace blow straight to your enemy's face.) This series of games just does something for me I've never seen in a game before, it's pretty magical.   You can be a bandit and raid caravans, you can be a merchant and build quite a bit of wealth, you can become a vassal for a king and be granted lands, you can get married, you can turn the vassals of another kingdom to your cause with some fancy convincing, OR you can start your own kingdom and gather followers through positive influence, or you can take the land by force. I suggest checking a wiki, some of the routes you can take are not very intuitive.   On the downside, I kinda wish there were more options in the ways of diplomacy and resolution, once a territory decides to go to war with you, the only way to get them to give it up and leave you alone is by smashing their entire kingdom to bits, or by coaxing vassals to join your cause, which (depending on the kingdom) can be nearly impossible to do. I also don't like how often enemy vassals escape from a defeat in battle, since when you are defeated in battle you almost ALWAYS get captured... Very annoying. I also wish there was a way to garrison villages or dispatch patrols without using vassals.   Over all, I would definitely recommend this game to anyone with a bit of patience and bloodlust. If the looks of the game put you off, wait for the new game to come out, it looks gorgeous and they may even address some of the negatives I brought up. Definitely worth a good look for anyone who loves midieval style fighting.",

Multiplayer is fun too (according to my son) and it works well with the Oculus Rift DK1. Here's my journey:  I got this game (and the original) a long time ago, for like a buck. It is easily worth full price, but it took me a few years to figure that out. I installed it, was confused by the overhead map, and absolutely sucked at combat. So, I uninstalled it, and forgot about it.  Then I kept reading little bits and pieces about it here and there. I thought, did I miss something? So, I re-installed it, and was still confused, and I still sucked at combat. I did bother to check out some mods, and was impressed with the Star Wars mod for Mount and Blade (not Warband). Still, it got quickly uninstalled, and forgotten about yet again.  Then, my son was looking for games to play with his Oculus Rift (I'm too old for that crap), and I bought M&amp;B: Warband for him. Well, I decided to re-install it again, so that I could maybe help him with any technical difficulties, pick up the trading cards, and just to check the game out again, it had been more than a year. Well, third time was the charm. I took the time to start figuring out the strategies of the overhead map part of the game, and spent some time learning the combat. The amount of depth in the base game alone is amazing, and the combat is very gratifying. Not to mention there are many well made mods that add plenty to the game to keep it fresh for a long time.  All I have played is single player, but according to my son, who doesn't like the overhead map bit at all, but loves the combat, multiplayer is great fun as well.",

On the other hand the 3rd person action sequences also keep the twitch gamer in me awake while I direct my troops to execute a flank, it's very balanced and satisfying.  The downsides would be massive amount of grinding / repetitious activities you have to undergo and how 'larger' fights are just a bunch of smalelr fights chained together. I can see this being a rendering and performance issue but there is definitely something a little disheartening of playing a 920 vs 800 battle played out 70/150 soldiers vs 70/150 soldiers at a time. Still the only real complaint would be some colision problems when seiging castles and how annoying the interface is at times when trying to access certain options through dialogue and pointless running through the same town to speak to a npc (because they just didn't add the option to the town menu).",

            "review_text": "This is the most disempowering simulation I have played.  That is not, to say, that it isn't also an excellent simulation. It's a mediocre game, but a phenomenal simulation. Maybe not for its efficacy of allowing you to do what you want, but for its complete obstinance in making that anything other than easy. If you have fantasies of living in a medeival land and being a roamnig hero, beholden to no-one and helping the common man, prepare to be bored out of your mind. The peasants mostly want to be left alone, and when they do want things it's things like grain. Or cows. And when they actually have problems you want to help with, like bandit attacks, they don't ask you to hunt bandits for them. They ask you to teach them how to defend themselves. Everything they ask for is reasonable. That's what makes it so numbing. Eventually you abandon your desire to be a roving, solo hero. (Perhaps you are sick of being run down and gored to death by a practically untrained mercenary who just coincidentally owns a horse, which elevated him to the status of a god. So you get a few friends and wander with them instead. You do some good deeds. You train some peasants. Whatever. Your small warband starts asking for pay. You realize you can't just keep a dozen skilled warriors on retainer without producing an income. You start working for guilds. Then lords. Your warband grows.  Flash forward a bit and you're collecting taxes, refusing to give the collected taxes to the lord you're collecting them for, razing villages and selling their valuables, growing rich on your mercenary war-profits by collecting pay from a liege whose wars you never actually help with and going mad with transitory power.  I mean, if you want power. And frankly there isn't much else to aspire to, despite the level of simulation. Sure, you can romance a few noble ladies. Or men, depending on your gender, but they predictably require far less romance. But that process is ardurous and takes agonizing months if not years of letter writing and 'visits'. 'I need to see you, love!' 'I am here!' 'Okay, later!' +3 affection.  Wow.  Maybe you want to lead a kingdom. Become a rogue power taking castles and villages and coming to lord over a vast army.  Well, your army size is limited by your Leadership. Better grind that. Not that it matters, your enemies scale so their armies are always bigger. Lords who you need to woo into your service take months if not years of letter writing and 'visits'. 'My friend, we should speak!' 'Okay.' 'We have spoken, goodbye.' +1 affection (sometimes). So...you'll never in any reasonable timeframe get what you want.  So it's an excellent simulation of medeival life. You can't really get what you want. The most effective short-term gains come from screwing over peasants, and your success can be instantly destroyed at the whim of a lord that glanced at you across a field and happens to have a larger army.  Who am I kidding? The game's rigged. They -all- have larger armies.  ...actually, that doesn't sound very simulationist.  Worth playing. Not at full price. Thank god it's on sale all the time. Don't spend more than five bucks.",

Mount &amp; Blade, as a game was meant to be modded which makes it a great platform to essentially play any game that you want.   Another fantastic feature, is the ability to have large battles without very much lag (obviously this depends upon your computer and graphics settings, at least to some extent). Most other games auto resolve combat or never even touch that type of combat because it would make the game slow to a stuttering crawl.   The low graphics have been brought up as being a detracter from the game (which in my opinion is a not an excuse). the reason for the low graphics, is that the massed battles would kill most any low to middle end computers.   I have played close the 300 hours and I do not see myself stopping anytime soon. I might be done playing the base game (which is pretty fun in its own right), but there are many mods left to play.   I highly recommend this to anyone interested in medieval warfare and/or RPG's.  Thank you for reading, and I hope you find this review helpful.",

What little I managed to achieve while running around slaughtering bandits as a young female warrior, I barely scatched the surface of what this game had to offer. There's certainly a lot in here.  It does have a very steep learning curve and the graphics have not aged well. While this may not be for everyone, if you're the type that likes to brag to your friends about what you managed to do in games like this, give it a try. You'll be entertained no doubt.",

            "review_text": "Mount &amp; Blade: Warband is an action / role-playing / strategy / medieval simulation - game developed by turkish developer TaleWorlds Entertainment.  I personally love this game and spent way too much hours on it, while never having stopped to have fun with it. Let me start off with the world map, which is pretty decent in size and variation. At the beginning of a new game the world, named Calradia, is split up in 6 factions: Kingdom of Nords, Kingdom of Swadia, Kingdom of Vaegirs, Kingdom of Rhodoks, Khergit Khanate and the Sarranid Sultanate. Those six factions are able to wage war on any other faction, even if the player doesn't take part. Every faction has it's own ruler and vassals, which can also change (I'm not sure about the ruler, but I've never seen him change). You start off alone in one of the big Cities and meet a merchant right at the beginning of the game, after you've been ambushed by a few bandits you can kill pretty easily. He gives you a quest to gather a few fighters in order to rescue his sibling, who is held captive in a nearby bandit camp. That's how you're thrown into the game. Now you have the choice what to do, you don't even have to help that guy. You could choose any faction you want and join it, as soon as you fulfilled enough quests for the respective leader of that faction and your party is big enough. You can expand his kingdom and hope to get some villages or even your own castle, if you're a very good fighter you may even get a whole City. But if you don't want to fight for a permanent income (Or you want to just invest in the future) you can also get a few businesses in some cities. Depending on what the surrounding villages produce a brewery for example can give you 400+ denars (the currency in the game) per week, or even cost you some money. Trading is part of the game and in every city you can go to the market for a few hours and just listen to the merchants and find some profitable trading routes for yourself.  But you may ask yourself now what the actual goal of the game is? Well the answer is pretty easy... Conquer EVERYTHING.  Build up your party, while being vassal for one of the rulers and if you feel strong enough tell him to f*ck off and then you start conquering every castle and city for your own kingdom. You can also promote your companions to vassals or 'steal' some from other factions. Or you help one of the throne claimants (every faction has it's throne claimant), but I never tried this so I sadly can't tell you anything about it.  To be honest, this game has pretty damn ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics, but at least it will run on a toaster from 1990...  The audio is acceptable and the soundtrack is very enjoiable, but is not guaranteed to run the whole time it should...  The controls are easy and you can get fast into commanding your fighters in the battle.  All in all this game definetly has more potential, but is astoundingly good and a deep medieval simulation, but the sequel (M&amp;B II: Bannerlord) promises to give us everything that is still requested. If you think you could like this game, get it. It probably still is a long time until Bannerlord is released, since it's release is to be announced...",

This game focuses on becoming the Emperor of Calradia, or making someone else the Emperor. So you go to towns, recruit farmers and such, and train them. You use that army you build to take cities and castles, and the towns they coincide with(which you may or may not get to keep if you have a liege) and take over the continent. Way too much to put in to one review, just get it if you like RPGs. It's great. Plenty of mods, too, if that's your preference.  As for multiplayer. It's rather bland. It's just a bunch of battling. Nothing too special. Not trying to offend the Devs, just my opinion. There is a good multiplayer addition to this, however, called 'Mount and blade: Napoleonic Wars'.

            "review_text": "If you want to 'live' out something akin to a stategic conquest game where youget to fight and order soldiers, which is immensely addicting and a whole lot of fun, then get this game. It has some flaws, yes, and the graphics are dated, but a lot of this can be fixed thanks to the amazing modding community which has created so many solid mods. There are complete era and map changes, that come with their own gameplay dynamics (and the existent gameplay dynamics are very fun). The game IS an RPG, and while I wouldn't compare it to Oblivion or Skyrim for example, because it's not complete open world exploration (which is a bit of a shame). It is, however, something that gives you real choice. You can choose to fight for an allegiance or kingdom, or work your way up as a vassal with a fief (a property such as a town, village or castle) and gradually collect more as you fight for them, and this creates a sense of drama between actually trying to get the fiefs (which is difficult as there is almost a fight for them). In that way, you can try to incriminate lords who might want it, losing honour but increasing your chances. You fight in your area against other people with your party. That's just one way to play it however - you can find an heir or claimant to the throne who wishes to claim the throne of a certain nation, and then work with them, and then later betray their trust or continue to work with them. A lot of human greed and human nature falls into it. You can either get greedy or choose to be honourable and fair - and there are consequences and benefits of all of this. I feel that there are some imbalances with this game. You can use a ool known as 'TweakMB' to tweak the game to your likings, but just remember not to overdo it because the game might get too easy and boring (but really, play how you want to). The game can be a lot of trouble and stressful on harder difficulties. I started at an easy difficulty and found a lot of challenge at the beginning, then found it progressively easier (but still somewhat challenging).  The game requires some time investment to know how it works, but when that's all done? Good luck on getting potentially hundreds of hours of your life consumed (although I wonder what else you could be doing that could be better than the hours you spend here).",

Learn the mechanics, do a few test playthroughs, and you'll get the hang of it eventually.  Also, for those interested, I highly recommend the Gekokujo mod; it fixes a lot of the base game's annoying mechanics and gives you so many options on what you want to do and how you want to do it.

Sounded like a good way for enterprising mercenaries to make coin. More fool me. We captured Senuzgda Castle from the Swadians and we soon made peace with them. Problem was we still faced the Sarranids. Lo and behold, their marshall assembled an army to capture Senuzgda from us.   My warband help defend the castle in the first attack. Their numbers: about 750. Ours, including the Rhodok nobles: 300. We managed to fight off the first attack, but the castle remained under siege, and it was a matter of hours until those dirty, dastardly Sarranids rebuilt their ladders and initiated another attack. They had the numbers, and the first battle wore us down. Defeat was inevitable. All we could do was wait it out for the sake of honor, and when the time came, we would fight to the very last--Then my month-long contract with the Rhodoks ran out. I had the opportunity to resign for another 30 days, or let it expire. I let it expire, left Senuzgda Castle, talked to one of the Sarranid nobles, and signed up as a mercenary. I found and captured a Rhodok noble whose warband was wondering nearby. I joined yet another successful siege of Senuzgda Castle toward the tail end. Love live Sultan Hakim! Long live the Sarranid Sultanate! At least until the end of the month. ;)  Pros: The sandbox aspects create so many unique situations. The writing remains strong despite a lack of narrative focus and surplus of the generic characters (see below). Combat's fun and complex. So many different builds to try. Customizable difficulty accommodates both beginners and hardcore veterans (but keep in mind how changes rebalance skills and stats).  Cons: Gameplay mechanics can be frustratingly opaque (eg. character creation). Diplomacy options are narrow unless you resort to mods. After a couple of hours, you'll begin to realize how generic NPCs all are. Graphics are fine, but it just looks indie-rific, lol.  Final Score: I AM HYPED FOR BANNERLORD. Warband is a rough gem for sure, but its depth and charm make up for any flaws.",

Help along an usurption? Be a loyal vassal? Get married? Take over the world? Or just run around alone whacking people with polearms? It's all possible.  Battles are a strong point. You are but one man, and strength of numbers is depicted quite realistically; on higher difficuulties, running alone towards an army will get you KO'd in a pinch. Build up your 'warband' of followers and you'll have a much better chance.   Unit types are not strictly enforced, but rather roles are determined by equipment and skill points. There is the 'rock paper scissors' of specializations, to some extent, with archers, infantry, and cavalry, but there is more nuance there too: skirmishers vs. heavy infantry vs spearmen, horse archers, knights and lancers, standard archers and crossbowmen... On harder difficulties, this becomes very important, as does tactical positioning of each unit on the battlefield. You'll want different soldiers for facing an army in an open field than you'll want for taking a fortified castle.  If you're a warmonger you'll often find yourself at a numerical disadvantage; exploiting your field's terrain and the strengths of your units is critical to your success. Variable terrain and constantly changing composition of both your own forces and your enemy's lead to enjoyably varied real-time tactical puzzles to work through.   Tweak config files to turn up the maximum army size in battles, and you'll witness a spectacle. Watching your troops line up across the field in front of you, shields at the ready; or leading a cavalry charge, slamming into the enemy line and taking out the enemy lord with a single blow from your lance; or standing atop a hill and watching the enemy get cut down by your archers as they approach; or stockpiling a force of crossbowmen and have them unleash a hail of fire that cleans off castle battlements in a few volleys; I haven't seen any game match the epicness that can be achieved here.   Behind it all is a large overworld, trading and an economic system, and some rudimentary politics / relations between factions and also between specific characters, which can be enhanced or altered by mods.  In later stages the game becomes a bit grindy. High-end gear costs astronomical amounts of money. The balance of income with tasks such as quests is also not quite right in the late game. To some extent, mods will fix this. Quests, dialogue, and menus in general are a bit messily done.  It's not the most polished experience, but if you can get past the faults and feel the roleplay, I think you could sink hundreds of hours into this game.",

            "review_text": "Possibly one of my favorite games of all time, Mount and Blade Warband has so much to offer, and so much of it is filled with depth.  The series is often called a Medieval Lord Simulator, and while I'd say the title is accurate for the most part, this is by no means the only way to play. It's more like a medieval life simulator, unless you want to simulate being a peasant in which case there's a gamestop just down the road. There is no structured story in the base game, though Viking Conquest does add one that is entirely optional, the player is left to their own devices. Become a powerful vassal, usurp a king, start your own kingdom outright, become an infamous bandit, or a wealthy trader, the world is your oyster.  The one issue I have is the intra-lord relations are pretty weak, in this respect it's almost like the player exists in a vaccum, the lords react to the player, forming friendships and rivalries with them, but no such system is in place for lords when interacting with one another. It's a trivial complaint but it's noticeable after a while.  Overall, Mount and Blade Warband is one of the best value for money games out there, I've enjoyed my time with it a lot and will continue to, and I've never heard someone say they flat out don't like it.",

But it's incredibly deep considering the rather simple interface, allowing for a decently wide array of content to explore.  The combat system shines. Mounted combat, including couching a lance make the biggest frustration in the game NOT finding a constant string of fights. It's a gloriously simple mechanic to learn, but rewards skill and timing the more effort you put into it. Easy to learn, difficult to master.  The range of fighting types is amazing. Spear combat is often overlooked (ie Skyrim) but in M&amp;B it's here in all it's glory. Horse archery, heavy cav charges, mowing down peasants with a mace while you look down from your mighty war steed.  On the fly unit orders are quick and effective. Lead your troops from the front or roam the rear lines barking orders and overseeing the battle from on high.  Companions and leveling them offers immersion in character back stories and in-fighting. When companions sometimes leave your employ, you feel their loss.  The content is far deeper than expected from an indie title. Fight as a merc, swear fealty, rebel and put yourself on the throne. But add in personal relationships, courting the ladies, hosting feasts, trading between cities, doing quests for lords and guild masters, fighting in tournaments, and more....and this game packed with content even though much of what you do is watch a tiny horse move around the world map.  Modding is a big part of M&amp;B. There are some amazing mods out there. Floris is huge but upgrades every aspect of the game. Gekokujo is a wonderful Samurai era version. LOTR, and GoT are both represented as well.  Just get this game. You will not be disappointed.",

If any element of the game seems lacking to you, than mods. There are so many mods to improve every aspect, or just modify it. The game is incredible.   One thing to consider, is how frustrating this game can be. You play for hours, get awesome gear, awesome companions, and an awesome army, than you get attacked by enemy armies and lose. You really lose. Taken prisoner for 10-100 days roughly, and when released your army is gone, companions are gone, and random items from your inventory or that you have equiped are gone.

Its like Pirates mixed with some old Amiga game where you was conquering castles, and winning knight challenges....You will start as merchant, novice Lord, or bandit, its on your choice what way you will choose, you can serve to Lords, to kings, you also can fight them all, you can be only Bandit Hunter with small army of knights, whos travelling from city to city to win a competitions, you can raise your power and install new goverment under your control, you can be despotic Lord whos hated by every coutry on map, also you can be so much feared so every army you will be atacking will run away...i was chased byten Lords with king in lead, but when i turned to deal with them with my less than 200 knights, they just turned back and run like rats....This is The game where you are not just clicking mouse to fight, this game make you feel it...you must use mouse properly to make hit, your mouse controls the aim of your swing with sword, and when you are swinging you still can little change a way, like in real world, also you can speedup your swing with mouse moving the same way...to do more critical hits...if you will do it properly you can take down enemy with one hit only with wooden practice sword!!:-) Fist you will be not able to htis someone from horse, because it need practice too...but after hours, you will be like death on wheels:-D you can sell captured soldiers for money, you can find heroes around, which be you companions, with skills like you have, you dont need to be medic if you have some, you can read some books to improve your skills, you can train your army if you are good trainer, to make them upgraded without any fight, you just grab some peasants, and after few days you have solid army from them, if some city hates you, you still can try to sneak in, ..if you remember the Pirates!....so you will love this game, its way better, its one best single player game ever made...and only reason i dont ahve 500 hours here on it is that i played it so much before i bought, so i payed money only as thanks to developers, and now on sales i should buy dlc, which i didnt play...but i am really scared to play this game again, its taking me away, to the meavil times, where i am Lord BallSmasher, and nothing around me in real life cant take me back:-D so, play it more wisely than me...it is little addictive!!:-)",

When I first started playing this game, I thought it was so dumb and way too difficult, so I pushed it aside for a few months. My friend then urged me to start playing it with him, so I did. Once I figured out everything, I couldn't stop playing it. That's when my life started spiralling downward. It all started off with me missing meals. I would skip dinner to play this game. Shortly after, I began to miss work because I was so addicted. I would be up until 6 A.M. playing this game every day. For my body to be able to obtain the energy needed to stay up late and play the game, I decided to take some 5-hour Energy. Once I phased out of that, I realized I needed something much stronger. That's when I became addicted to something more powerful than Mount &amp; Blade. I became addicted to heroin. To this very day, I inject myself with 7 heroins every night just so I can stay up to play this beautifully created game. My wife left me, my children died from starvation since I had no time to feed them (beseiging castles come first). Now all that's left is me, and my lovely Calradia. I love every bit of it.   10/10 Would lose job and become addicted to heroin again.",

There's always something to do because you'll likely never conquer all of the land in Calradia, and even if you did you can start a new character and start a new journey. There are endless possibilities for your character's adventure, tons of weapons, armor, an in-depth trading system. The only set back is there isn't a story, and the quests are fairly repetitive. Whenever you get a more advanced piece of equipment, or move to a new stage in the game it feels very rewarding because it takes quite some time to build up your renown and to get a lot better. The enemies are well balanced and varied for early game as well as late game experience. As well, if you turn the difficulty up all the way the game is insanely more difficult, and there is a lot of customization of difficulty; the 'happy-medium' for you is very easy to find.  I've played all of Taleworld's games and this one continues to be my favorite, as I'm not a fan of the multiplayer.  Definitely worth the $22 and even more in my opinion.",

The amount of paths you can take are grand. From King/Queen, to bandit, to loyal vassal, to bounty hunter. Another thing I love about this game is it's pace. The game can be slow, or hectic, and you can always make the game exciting and hectic by going to war with another faction (but be warned, peace is hard to come by at times. There will be moments where you can finally breathe because you have somehow managed peace from a stuborn nation.)  In the grand scheme of things, the only cons I can think of are its graphics. Also the game can get boring, but then it's exciting to start a new character, to experience new things!  Between the still active community, outstanding mods, and fluid gameplay, I am in love with this game. I can always come back to it, no matter how long it's been.",

A bit of strategy, tactics, good combat system and the soundtrack tho helps to identify yourself in the game. The world that you live is a REAL world, with its wars and its economy. Wanne be a good innocent mercant? Feel free to go, but watch out for bandits. Wanne be a cruel Lord that leave death and destrucion behind his trace? Recruit some men and ride for the next age of terror and tyranny or just remain a good Vassal at the service of your only one King and help him into his mission. Mount and Blade: Warband is really a hard game to talk about, harder from a person that played only 37 hours. But if you wanna a really good medieval immersive game, totally go fo it.  Note: If you can buy also the expansion 'Napolenic Wars' that add a new game taking you from the age of steel and fire to the age of musket and great revolutions.",

            "review_text": "I've been playing M&amp;B since before Warband and still do. I pulled a lot of hours in retail version, before purchasing WB on Steam and never regretted spending money. Crazy, right? So the vanila itself is fine until you get used to the game. It brings up lots of recognizable weapons and armor design from the most popular cultures of Medieval period to choose from. It gives a satisfying feeling, when defending a wall among your men bringing down scores of men. It's a great feeling to outflank your enemy that surpasses you in quantity (nearly most of the time) with a solid Knight charge. To capture an annoying lord that has been pillaging your village over and over and getting ransom for him. To either become a marshal and bring forth the lords, or try to start your own Kingdom, which is a difficult task at the beginning. You will end up sooner or later (after a hundred or two hours), realising that challenge is basically gone, since you've cracked the mechanics and finally got everything right and start thinking there is nothing more the game can show you. And then you find mods.. Bryttenwalda, Europe 1200, 1257 AD, MP Mount and musket, CRPG, and coop like Nord Invasion and many more, like roleplaying Persistent World. With new features, reworked morale, recruit system. Completely new and quite accurate maps with a lot more Lords, towns and Castles to play through. It's hundreds of hours of fun for such a small price.  And then, there are payed Add-ons, basically mods going in a full fledged release. Not all of them are definetly flawless, they carry many bugs in them and some additional work is always required, but that is only due to the engine problems.  The engine itself is very old now and is not suited to work out so many scripts in huge mods like the 1257 AD I mentioned earlier. All of the new features are difficult to implement properly, especially there are problems with Spawning and Path finding, with high-end machines dying with 600-700 hundred men fighting on the field, with crashes and stuff like that.  Still, it's one of the few games I so highly will and do support with my money, getting all the add-ons.  Since the latest Viking Conquest, I need to mention a few words. 1. I got crashes as everyone else, but applying checkbox in Launcher configuration: Load textures on demand, fixed it entirely. 2. As I mentioned earlier, there are some geodata problems once in a while, where you can fall through the floor during naval battles while making a transition between ships, some invisible walls (bugs) that make your soldiers stuck in one place, until they walk around it. 3. I got into trouble when becoming a lord of Fierse in the beginning. A little later still been made an Outlaw (that's one of the few outcomes when playing Campaign in the beginning) with this kingdom, making me their sworn enemies. I figured out a way later how to fix this trouble, by going to the King's town while NPC was inside, talking to him (this way he can't fight you) and paying a tribute of 17k to end up this problems. Then I left the Kingdom. I realise developers couldn't potentially figure out someone could pull this off, like me and I don't hate them for it. :) 4. Somehow troop number on the field is been capped at 3054 (smthn like that), so you'd better check that option, or you will get a lagfest in 700-1000 battles.  Overall I like it, the naval battles are funny, though not with their own problems (in a mess it's hard to navigate ship through other ships and not getting lipped to them), but this is simply the engine, that can't pull this off in a more fancy manner.  All in all this is a 10/10 game, that gives a player some unique experience. Bannerlord 2 is somewhere behind a corner, which is one of the most personal highly anticipated game.",

            "review_text": "This game has a deep 3rd person medieval battle simulator at its core, with strong RPG-style leveling, map conquest, and some simple questing to build relationship with NPCs. To explain how GREAT this game is, let me tell you the story of a character I just retired. I started as a no-name who got mugged in a big town, and ended as the emperor of the known world. I was a level 1 son of a ruined nobleman with a rusty sword, a hunting crossbow, and a lame horse. I ended as a level 43 king warrior with a coat of plates armor, riding a heavily armored horse, and I could swing my masterwork sword twice per second. Did I mention I was carrying around 2.5 million gold coins and ruled over 22 towns, including the one where I got mugged? My first company had seven peasants with pitchforks and butcher knives. A few months I had leveled up my peasant and had a decent infantry squad supported by deadly but weak archery squad. The battle system is well fleshed out and you can command separately each type of unit and issue them about 25 different commands. When I retired I ran a company of 150 elite cavalry units, the famous swadian knights. I could literally take on companies almost thrice my size with favorable terrain (armored horses with armored warriors on them don't do so well in mountainous terrain you see.) When I retired I had leveled 4 NPC heroes in my company to level 35+. I had made them all cavalry, but I could have made them archers or infantry, it was up to me to choose their skills. One of them was a good engineer to build siege towers promptly, another one had great spotting so that my map vision was extended. I also ruled over 25-ish lords to whom I had given countless villages and castles as fiefs so that they could run large companies, some of them larger than mine. When I retired I was the most famous man in the land. I was also known as a man of honor since I avoided looting villages, freed allied lords and let rival lords go when I captured them on the battlefield. I had won hundreds of battles, some against rival kings and their gigantic companies, and had killed 15,000 foes out in the open battlefield or during sieges. If anything I said here appeals to you, do yourself a favor and pick up this game. Yes the graphics are not that great, but I was having so much fun that I did not notice.",

Starting off it is important to cover this point. There really is no story to be had here other than what your actions cause. This game is driven by the player's actions and that of the many war parties that prowl Calradia. Mount And Blade Warband is about Tactics in both the battlefield and somewhat in the political spectrum. Also with dozens and dozens of mods from a great community this game has plenty of replayability and each one introduces a fresh feel that almost makes the game feel entirely different.   Some mods worht lookign into are:  The Clash of Kings Mod which sets the Game in the world of A song of Ice and Fire (Game of Thrones) The Veiled Stars or the Last Days which both set the game in The Lord of The Rings. Gekokujo which sets the game in feudal Japan Full INvasiojn 2 which is a mod that intrduces a multiplayer cooperative expireance of waved based combat of enemies that vary from Roman Leagions to Star Wars Drones.  The Multiplayer aspect of this game offers somethign exciting and just feels purely seperated from any other game besides perhaps chivalry. Sword and shield, Bow and Arrow or one large Battle axe all fighting in death matches, And even a siege game mode where one tea, defends a keep while the other fights to take control.   Moving back to singleplayer to finis hthis review, this is the core of the game and my favrorite part is the ability to choose a faction to fight for and claim Calradia, or, if you have to gonads for it, fight for yourself and carve your own empire. You start off by choosing your own past varying from a poor street urchen who grew up to be a burglar to being to child of a vasasal who has lost all of their family title. From there however you choose what to do. Do odd jobs for casdh and build a small band of mercenaries or immediately begin working under a vassal or lord to gain favor and be awarded a Lordship and a place among his Vassals. There are even Tournaments and arenas to win you money and reknown. There is so much offered in this gem of a under the radar game that for anyone with hundreds of hours to blow or simply looking to pass some time with a sandox where they can see who would win a fight between a few hundred Pompus Swadians and a few Grizly Nord Berskers can find something to keep them coming back for more.",

There isn't any real story here, but that's fine - it means you can make your own. You can be a merchent, a mercenary, a vassal, or even make your own kingdom.   In addition to the hundreds of hours you could put into the singleplayer, the multiplayer offers hundreds more. It offers team deathmatches, free for all deathmatches, battles (where if you die you stay dead), duels, and my personal favorite sieges, where one side tries to capture a flag in the center of their opponents castle. The multiplayer is where the amazing combat of Mount and Blade shines. The best players are amazing and will defeat you nine times out of ten in one on one combat, but don't think its not easy to get into. Everyone is friendly and if you stick by your teammates as you get a feel for it you'll soon be fighting with the best of them. I highly recommend looking up combat guides for the game - there are fantastic ones out there for each of the three general troop types (archer, calvary, footman).

Get a fast horse to outrun bandits or hire a few Bodyguards. Establish a traderoute and learn which village sells cheap goods.  Rather be a Bandit ? Harrass villages, steal cattle and be a thorn in any lords side.  Lead a mighty army and solve the problems that arise with that, food for your troops, gold for their wages.   Personally i play a solo character, no army. I hunt groups of bandits, compete in tournaments and go on quests for villages and lords. Amassing the fortune i need to set up shops all over Calradia.   Once i am wealthy enough i will set up an army and lay my claims.  And that is why this game is so entertaining.",

This game does not have a set story line, and has so much flexibility, making it very well rounded in what you could be. A marauding looter, going to raid villages screwing over townspeople, and running from the law as you make a healthy profit on stolen goods, a trader who...trades! Yeah, not much more to that one. A lord under a kind alligned with a faction, kind or cruel is your choice, or top it all off as king of the land. Obviously, with all that said, this game is set in a medieval like land, so that is a heads up if I've ever told one. Graphically, the game isn't stunning, but it gets the job done, and a job well done it is. The tracks are far and few between, so it is hard to appreciate the game for that, it does not break the immersion however. Then finally, the key aspect of the game, it is a mix of a strategy game, as you try to figure out the best course of action as you wander the land searching for glory and excitement, or men and war, or riches and fortune, but also manage villages, castles, and even cities, should the King grant you the fief. However, it's not all about managing fiefs, you also have to have an army at your back if you hope to live out in the bandit and war infested world, and you must manage it, and be their leader. The fun part is when you ride into battle with your men, but I'll let you experience the glory for yourself. I highly recommend the game if you're looking for a unique game to play, as this game requires skill, and commitment for progess to play.",

Be warned though,the initial gathering of troops can feel a little grindy,as can going around kissing all the lord's asses,so I recommend for your first playthrough that you create a male noble,and start out either in Swadia or in The Kingdom of The Nords (KotN). Sarranid Sultanate and Khergit Khanate have annoying mounted bandits that travel in large packs,the Rhodoks have lots of smaller bands but they're deserters will tear you a new ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ like its their ♥♥♥♥ing job. the Grand Munincipality of the Vaegirs is just kinda empty and boring. However, KotN has sea raiders which,in my experience, were much easier/fun to fight. the Swadians have very few bandits and the largest empire,but they're surrounded by literally ever kingdom so they get gangbanged pretty hard in the first year or so. I highly reccomend Floris Mod which adds ons of improvements,big and small. If you're a fan of The Game of Thrones then 'A Clash of Kings' is for you! but these aren't the only mods!

I had it through other (possibly pirated) means and played for hundreds and hundreds of hours until I finally gave in and just bought it to support the devs. M&amp;B Warband is a game set in a fictional world of Calradia in which several feudal kingdoms each wish for total rule over the realm, and will do whatever it takes to reach that goal. You start, if you don't cheat, as a peasent with nothing more that cheap weapons, some gold, some food, and a merchant asking you to help him out. If you do so, it'll start you with a 'getting the basics' tutorial quest, and set you on your way to carve your adventure. You can do anything you want from being bandits, to leading a mercenary army fighting for whatever side has the most gold, or even break away from one faction and start your own kingdom with its own vassals and ladies. You can fight in tournaments and bet on yourself to earn money and honor. This game has a lot replability, not to mention the endless hours you can get from modding (which is extremely easy, btw.) The only bad thing I can say about this game is that the graphics are sort of sub-par, but they're not really that bad when you look at everything else the game has to offer. This is DEFINETLY worth the $20.  TL;DR: M&amp;B Warband is set in a stage of warring feudal kingdoms, and the player can set out to do whatever he/she wishes. The swordplay is very nice, the content is never lacking in playability, the graphics are iffy, but this game is sooo worth the money.  Verdict: 9.5/10",

In all seriousness, I highly recommend this game, especially being a milliteristic orientated RTS junkie. Theres virtually no rules to the game, well, excluding the laws of physics and common sense. The success of your campaign is completely dictated by your decisions. Everything is decision making. The battles can be a guarenteed victory or an absolute bloodbath depending on the quality of your army. The qulity of your army comes from how well you are doing financially. Theres so many features that I obviosly didn't even know where to start with this review. Just buy the ♥♥♥♥ing game.",

These knights will likely become the backbone of your kingdoms army [should you so choose to join or start a kingdom]. You can be anything from a merchant, to a bandit warlord. This is the best medieval style game with large scale battles available. Companions are a nice bonus, but they are very simplistic and unfortunately unlike other games I am unable to remember a single companions name becaues they are really flat characters with relatively uninteresting stories. The siege battles are amazing, fairly unrealistic due to engine limitations but I havn't seen better; but that doesnt mean they shouldnt improve this feature significantly where possible. Also I think another benefit would be having romances that matter, and actually interacting with said romanced character.   Negatives are the weak companions stories + over companion interaction system. GAME NEEDS MOAR' diplomacy options, more RPG elements. I hope the next iteration has a an overhauled companion system with deep characters. They should also implement more interesting side quests, all the side quests in this entire game feel empty. Towns, Castles, and villages are need many more building options that have more significant impacts on the game. Also I believe it would be beneficial to add some way to tell lords [that like you a lot where to go] the current options are extremely limited and make running a large empire/country/kingdom/whatever a pain.",

There is no story in the base game but the story you build for yourself which is something I've always enjoyed and feel is the best thing that an RPG can do for you.  The difficulty can certainly be up there at times, but if you need to you can always bring it down. Just never expect to one man an entire army. This is not Dynasty Warriors.  The Viking Conquest DLC continues to be even less Dynasty Warriors-esque with an very increased difficulty and even more vicious AI. The story provided with Viking Conquest is pretty good, i have yet to complete it as, unfortunately, the expansion is quite buggy and crashed fairly often. However, the addition of sea transport and the setting make it very worth it and the company continues to support even the base game and continues to fix any and all bugs they are able all as they prepare for the next entry into the series, Bannerlord, which I am also eagerly awaiting.",

It is also one of the few games that makes more out of melee combat than simple button mashing.  Set in a fictional medieval world with six kingdoms that vaguely resemble historic cultures, Warband is part action game, part RTS and part RPG. It´s basically Medieval 2 with a focus on the actions and development of your own character.   Magic, elves and orcs are completely absent. Instead, there´s lots of different weapons, armor and fighting styles as a result. You start the game wandering around on the map, gathering a small warband around you and battling here and there. As you progress, these battles will take on a grander scale, be fought with better weapons and for different motives: where you'll be running from bands of robbers at first, the end will hopefully have you fighting to expand your own kingdom. Multiplayer is also fun, offers a whole bunch of maps and a few different modes, all of which work.   As for the actual combat: Warband is one of the few games that really took care to do melee well. It´s much more than simply mashing buttons like a maniac, knowing when to block, what direction to attack from etc. matters here. Newer players are nevertheless given plenty of options to make things more forgiving for them.  The game does both of its core parts very well: the action is fun and the strategy stays interesting, but gets a little grindy towards the end. It also runs really well on older systems. The graphics are not top notch, but definitely ok and in fact give the game a nice old-school feeling.   All in all, Warband offers you great value for money.

I bought this game through amazon and put 100+ hours into before rebuying it on steam and putting another 200+ hours onto it. Play the PC demo, it will show you what the basic game is about. From there its time to embark on countless battles as you work to develop yourself from a nobody to mercenary captain to a lord to a king.   Combat in this game is responsive and enjoyable. Galloping down the field and delivering a couched lance to the enemy king is deeply satisying. Your army is truly however you want it to be composed. Want to skirmish? Build up a core of powerful archers and harass and distract the enemy forces as you tear them apat. Want to charge? Assemble an army of power Swadian Knights and crush the enemy underfoot. Want to settle down and turtle? Get Rhodok Crossbow and Spearmen and hold the line. You are an important part of each battle and must juggle the roles of commander and powerful warrior.   If you ever find yourself unimpressed with certain game mechanics, look to the mods you fool! Native Expansion, Floris, Prophesy of Pendor, Brytenwalda, Clash of Kings, SOOOO MANY GOOD MODS. Modding in this game is SUPER easy. simply download the filepack, place in modules, and when starting choose the module you wish. Mods in this game are full fledged new games. Native Expansion tweaks and adds to the many bast features of the game, improving diplomacy, fief management, and character options. Floris continues improving, overhauls the graphics, and revamps the troops trees entirely. Prophesy of Pendor creates an entire new world with new lore, units, factions, cities, knighthood orders, rogue adventurers, and MUCH hight difficulty. Brytenwalda changes the setting to 1066 British Isles and has like 60 cities compared to the base games ~15. Holy ♥♥♥♥ does this games mod scene rock by bringing forth the most direct improvements to the game.   Play the game, appreciate its quirks, play the mods, fall in love.",

Commanding is extremely basic, this is far from Total War. While on the other hand you have different attacks and blocks - you can even manually strike/block from the direction of your choosing.  Viking Conquest is worse. Graphics are not much better than stock game, but optimisation is worse. The original release was bug-ridden and received a lot of criticism. Granted, most of these problems have been fixed since then. Sadly there is one thing you can't fix: the online experience. The online community is probably the worst I've ever seen, even compared to other games in the series. Mob mentality, TK-ing, spoiled kids... the dregs of online gaming humanity.  Recommended only for singleplayer and overhauls.",

(depending on your difficulty setting.)  multiplayer is pretty much the same. small to large scale battles, duels, CTF, TDM, battle (no respawning in a 100 v 100 fight is exctutiatingly painful to wait on)   on the positive side, the game has excellent framerate and loading times, even on low end rigs. the gameplay can be addicting if you learn it, and the multiplayer is an exciting foray into what it was once like to charge onto the frontlines of a medieval battle. the soundtrack can get a bit repettitive and annoying, as does the sound design.  on he whole, i'd give it a 5/10. the game functions, and there aren't many bugs or gliches to complain about, though it's a bit slower paced for my liking.

Warband uses a combination of third-person/first-person fighting, a couple of RPG elements and RTS management to create massive fights between armies of people while keeping you in the middle of all the action.  The game allows you to join one of the many different and unique factions in game to loot trade caravans, pillage villages, siege castles and much more in the name of your faction. Though you can even take this a step further however, if you are brave enough, by taking on all the factions by creating your own faction and fight for the goal of ruling over all of the land in the name of your faction. The game can have an impressive amount of troops on the screen at a time, making these epic fights that never becomes bored to play, keeping you constantly in the action. Your character can be customized in a great variety of weapons, armor, and horses. Your character can also customized in a variety of skills to maximize both the character's and the army that you control. One other nice addition to the game is the ability to change to either first-person or third-person at anytime giving you option to change between them at anytime.  However, I have ran across many bugs in game for both the PC and the Mac versions of the game, though none of these bugs were game breaking, it was just a little annoying to see. On the PC version, I was having some problems with the map screen textures not working correctly making it a pain to see anything, though this was easily fixed by rebooting the game. On the Mac version, I would sometimes see a gigantic red shadow of myself in the sky when doing the tutorial quest to save the merchant's brother from the sea raiders and I also saw some untextured wire frames for the trees in both the map screen and the battle screens, though this might be fixed in a future patch. Also, the textures in this game are not that good, but the still definitely get the job done.   I would still recommend that you try their free demo first to make sure if this game is right for you, but at the end of the day, what the game does it does fantastically. Its a solid third-person/RPG/RTS-like game with only minor problems and I highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a unique RPG that stands itself out of the crowd.",

So much so that I would easily rate it 9/10, and that is just the base game. Add in the modding community and it becomes a 10/10.   Gameplay:  You create your own character and start off making a small group of infantry, cavalry, and archers. You then will be working your way up by defeating enemies, joining factions, making alliances, betraying commanders, attacking villages, castles, and cities. Eventrually, you will have opportunities to either take a castle or city for the faction you chose to side with and govern it under their name, or take one for yourself as king, and raise up armies under your control.  Gameplay is amazing and can not wait for a new Mount and Blade.  Keep up the work.",

Oh and the music. That also sucks, although you can change it if you play around with the sound files. However, its the gameplay that makes up for it. M&amp;B:W is a third person hack &amp; slach, a RTS and a market sim. You create your charecter and you are ploped into caladria. You choose a faction (6 I Belive) and start there. The tutorial isn't one. You start getting attacked by bandits. The combat is simple Depending on how you swing, you swing in a diffrent direction. There is also a First Person mode, but its only use is if you are crosbow sniping. Then a tradesman helps you out asks you to resque his brother from bandits and then you are off on your own. The world is huge. To move in the map, you click where you want to go and then your party moves there. You can hire vilagers from towns and train them. If you run into a lord they'll talk to you (Or Attempt to destroy you if you have a bad relation with them). Runing into bandits causes a battle. You can also make a living off being a bandit yourself. You can also buy land and make an enterprise. There are often tournaments of some towns. You should start by going to a King and getting a mercanary contract. Gain some renown and become a vassal/jarl/Something. Or instead of the contract gain renown and get a claimant to thier throne. Or make your own faction. Just a warning: this game can get a little addictive.",

The answer, as easily reflected by my (low, as a result of offline play) play time, is yes.

Plus, with M&amp;B2 in development, it's hard not to be curious for those who never touched it and it's bound to bring back some veterans while waiting.  +Good combat. Easy to get in to, but fairly difficult to master on higher difficulties and in multiplayer +Highly flexible difficulty settings: Have your character or allies take less hits for a more forgiving experience, or keep it 1:1 for a more difficult but 'realistic' experience, or make parrying easier by turning automatic blocking on. +Open-ended Single player campaign: Your character can be part of any faction, rise up, betray them or forge your own kingdom. Build your army from the ground up, train them and fight for what you want in this low-fantasy Medieval universe. +Character customisation: Surprisingly deep, tons of RPG elements with a variety of skills and attributes makes it decent for role-playing. +Item and Unit variety: Each faction had a different upgrade tree from their basic peasant unit. There is a huge variety of weapons, from maces to longswords to crossbows to bardiches. If it's a medieval weapon, it's probably in the game. There are also a ton of armour sets available fitting for the fantasy-medieval theme of the game. +Incredibly fun Multiplayer. Difficult to get into, but insanely satisfying because of the combat system. +Insane modding community: From total conversions to add-ons, there's an insane variety on the official forums.  -Poor diplomacy between factions in the singleplayer. It's very bare and consists of two factions either being at war, at peace, or in a truce. No alliances are possible between factions and it's practically impossible to influence the state of war/peace.  -Little to no gameplay for governance, making peacetime insanely boring. The only things you can do related to governance is choosing a marshall (if you are the faction leader) and build some buildings in villages or towns you own.  -Graphics are pretty bad. They look outdated and the textures aren't great either, but the game runs very well even on low-end computers because of that. They're still easy to overlook.  +/-The DLC seem to be very hit or miss. I personally adored the Napoleonic Wars DLC and spent a lot of time doing community Line Battles, but the community is practically dead as far as I know. I have yet to try the newer DLC, but it seemed to have been poorly received on launch, with patching helping somewhat.  All-in-all, it's one of my favourite games ever because of the amazing gameplay, good multiplayer and great modding community. Its replay value is simply unmatched.",

(which was weird considering I was biding my time to take the whole world from under everyone's noses.) The world itself is massive. Every town has imports/exports and that affects prices greatly. Honestly anyone looking for a medival caravan simulator would love this game based on that alone. Be a lone warrior patrolling from tournament to tournament. Or be cliche and rule the world (this will take hundreds of hours however) The combat is also pretty good. You can customize enemy AI (also affects allies) so if they're not putting up much of a fight you can turn it up. If they're filling you with arrows from a quarter mile away you can turn it down.

Hire villagers. Train them to fight. Win tournaments. Fight bandits. Rise among the ranks. Overthrow the king (or make your own faction). Unite the land.  - Average soundtrack. Extremely small collection of tracks that ends up repeating MULTIPLE times throughout the game, Sometimes the game even ends up falling silent.  - For Beginners, really hard to find a specific town/castle/city, (Some sort of search needs to be implemented)  - 95% of the game is spent travelling from one place to another and sometimes the 'realism' just ends up sacrificing the gameplay (ex: half movement rate on night time).  - If you don't have the patience to read stuff, this game isn't for you, As the NPC's don't speak,,, they only chat with you with a streams of wall of text.

The game features one of the best medieval combat systems I've seen in games, the system is simple to learn, but tactical, utilising distance and momentum that makes it a better representaion of medieval combat than games like TESV:Skyrim.  This in combination with the accurate collision zones and hit boxes make a great game to own. Also worth mentioning is it's modest size and fast loading times, from starting up the game you could be in the middle of a saved story or a custom battle in minutes. Don't let the modest graphics fool you, the campaign map itself is massive, and battles can include 300 soldiers or more at a time, each with evenly rendered detail and smooth animations, with a freat unit command system good for all players. This game also counts as a great platform for mods, and now that it has Steam Workshop, Mount &amp; Blade: WARBAND is a must buy, especially on sale. IN SHORT Massive map with cities villages and castles controlled by six independant factions that the player is free to roam at will, a unique and satisfying combat system, a modest size and system requirements, fast loading times, hundreds of units with massive battles and features for fine or coarse army management and everything in between, excelent mod support, and now with steam workshop support, and a great combat system. I love it. 9/10 ",

Mount And Blade: Warband looks as if it was built for Windows computers in the XP era, but it runs nicely in Windows 8. The attack system is unique, utilizing the mouse to determine the direction of your sword swing. If you run out of money early on in the game, like I did on the first time I played, there is an Arena in which you can fight computer players for money. Then you can use the money to buy things to sell other places to get more money. I think. I never really did understand the purpose of the sausages I bought.  One problem I had is the how the horse controls. The direction the horse faces is different from the direction the camera faces, and this can be a bit disorienting when trying to attack. Also, the horse doesn't stop when you let go of your forward button (For me, W). You have to slow it down manually using your back button (For me, S).  ~PheonixSK13's sister",

However, with mods Warband is perfection. Fight off zombie hordes with a band of survivors; Conquer medieval Europe with armies of thousands; Crush the Rebel Alliance in a galaxy far, far away; Carve a kingdom out of the warring factions of rich, completely original lands; Command ranks of infantry, cavalry and specialists in the Napoleonic Wars; Defeat wave after wave of thousands of combinations of enemies. All of this is possible with mods that TaleWorlds fantastically supports.  I cannot recommend this game highly enough. If you enjoy ANY kind of roleplaying or combat game, you will adore Warband for the base game and the mods/DLC it supports.

What i especially like about this game is the scope of battles, as you could be in a group of 10 in a battle of 100 and i like the feeling of being on the ground and being apart of an amazing conquest. This game also gives me the feeling as if i am playing the old battlefront 1 &amp; 2 as it makes be in the shoes of a soldier who is fighting for a specific side and you see epic and massive battles in front of your face! Eventhough Mount &amp; Blade is not based off of real events and real civilisations, the different factions still take inspiration from real kingdoms and countries; for example the Sarranid Sultanate take inspiration from arabic hierarchy as the leader is called Sultan Hakim and the word 'Sultan' is an arabic word for ruler or king.  Now it is time to talk about some minor issues with the game and may i remind you i do not dislike this game but it does have a few minor issues as every game does. Obviously this game can get a bit glitchy and also if you want to use cheats then you can, but from personal experience but not spam specific ones such as ctrl+alt+f4 because this could push you out of the game as it has done to me, so dont spam.  In conclusion, i can definitely say that if you like medieval fantasy, strategy and rpg games then this is a really good game. Eventhough it has the odd glitch or lag here or there you should be fine for the rest of it and so i'd finally like to say that this is a good game worth playing and if you don't like then that's ok. I would recommend this game to most people and it can be worth it [depending if you want to get into it or not] The price may be a bit steep but if you buy it you wont be dissapointed",

You can level up your MP character und earn game-money to buy new weapons, stuff etc. Also, the Napoleonic Wars modification Mount and Musket changes the game completely into a new game.

From humble beginnings leading peasants while you're wearing leather armour and chipped weapons to being hired as a mercenary for a kingdom that you will someday betray and take over their lands.  It does take a while to become powerful and a lot of bad runs but maintaining a sustainable power kingdom is really satisfying. Or you could ♥♥♥♥-around with cheats which is a good idea for the first run so you can learn the mechanics of the game.  Oh and don't forget the mods! Game of Thrones - kill all your most hated characters and sit on the Iron Throne! Warhammer Fantasy - dude... you get to play as a skeleton with a gun... nuff said  Needent I say more?

The map is impressive, whilst the missions make up for some entertaining outcomes! This game had the feel of Elite (to all those old 80's/90's gamers!), open ended, and allowing you to progress at your own rate. What made this game particularly special though, were the sheer amount of modded gaming engines available to download. I played the Roma Bellum mod, and the only description I can give is superb.

If any element of the game seems lacking to you, than mods. There are so many mods to improve every aspect, or just modify it. The game is incredible.   One thing to consider, is how frustrating this game can be. You play for hours, get awesome gear, awesome companions, and an awesome army, than you get attacked by enemy armies and lose. You really lose. Taken prisoner for 10-100 days roughly, and when released your army is gone, companions are gone, and random items from your inventory or that you have equiped are gone.

That's a long development cycle, but the game started as a two-person operation between Armagan and his wife. Since then, the graphical presentation has improved slightly, while the models have remained somewhat behind the curve.   Nonetheless, I consider this game the game of my last decade, with gameplay that is second to none. This is the game that inspired the entire medieval combat simulator genre. In addition to addictive multiplayer arena-style matches, this game also has a robust single-player campaign that is open-ended and not story driven. You make your own story in Warband.  The graphics, while not really pretty or even the best optimized, are good enough to carry the gameplay, which is where this game's strengths lie. There's no other game in the rpg genre that does mounted combat, and melee combat better. It's rare to find a game where you can be the single warrior, among hundreds and in some cases (if you have a strong enough system to support them and capability to mod the game) thousands of troops on the same map, duking it out and cutting down their opposing ragdolls.  I don't know what else to say, I've been playing this game for so long that there's probably a ton in here that I'm taking for granted and not mentioning here. The best advice I can give to anyone who is on the fence, is to try the demo first, that should put you over the fence on whether or not to buy it.",

            "review_text": "Crysis sells itself largely on the strength of its graphics. And I know I’m not the first to say this, but that means that it will age like Andrew Lloyd Webber in the African sun. The Mount and Blade series is a shining example of how to make a game for the ages. It was released in 2010, and even then the games graphics was unimpressive. But if you can see past that, it is an unappreciated gem. It is an open world RPG where you move across the world on a 3D map. There are five factions who at the start of the game are equally balanced, but as soon as the game starts they start fighting over territory. It’s almost as if the player’s aura is so bad that it immediately corrupted everyone. The premise of the game is total freedom and you can choose to play the game in whatever way you want. Of course, this isn’t entirely true. It is a game, so there will always be restrictions, but the gamer makes it work because they actually had enough self-awareness to give the central characters backstories, some of which are even compelling. There are a number of NPC characters you can recruit to you party, and they boost your party’s stats. You can choose to do jobs for hire until your party is big enough to take down a fort, and begin you journey to absolute world domination, if you are a Sauron kind of guy. Or you can join forces with one of the disgruntled lords, and help him take back his faction, and the the world, if you are more of Boromir kind of guy. Or you can live your life in peace, and make your living trading goods, if you accidentally opened Mount and Blade when you meant to open EVE online, in which case you might be better off not bothering mate. It’s not all sunshine however. The AI act like they have lived their entire life in fear of knowledge of any sort. I concurred the world in two days by putting all my immortal NPC buddies in heavy armour, equipping them with huge shields, and arraigning them in a line in front of my archers, like a human wall. The enemy archers would fruitlessly fire at my shield wall of doom, while my own archers shot the enemies to ♥♥♥♥. Another petty niggle I have with the game is the slave trading aspect. You can take prisoners, and sell them to slave traders. But they don’t stay in one place, but travel around. This means that when you want to sell your prisoners as slaves, you have to run around to the different towns until you find one. And one wonders what purpose this could possibly serve, besides ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off. So that aspect of the game can ♥♥♥♥ right off. It’s boring and unnecessary.  But in broad strokes the game is an engaging and interesting experience. It’s like Skyrim if you had the option of killing Ulfric Stormcloak from the get go, and then concur Skyrim by yourself.",

I had recently gotten the original Mount &amp; Blade for free during the  GOG.com  Winter Sale and had been playing it. The original leaves a lot to desire and Warband actually does a pretty decent job of adding more content. The premise of Mount and Blade is simple; You play a charcter who has traveled to the medival realm of Calradia which consists of multiple constantly warring kindoms. You can mind your own business and simply kill bandits, be a bandit, help villagers, or even start your own trading operation. Or if you want, you can ally (or just start and uprising) with one of the kingdoms and TAKE OVER THE WORLD!! (Well, not quite the world, the GAME world.) The graphical differences between the two games are minimal. TaleWorlds has changed some armor and weapons and has added a bigger map with a new faction which is meant to resemble Arab cultures. If you've played the original, you'll also note some differences in how weapons are swung, while they are definitely more realistc, if you are used to the original then it takes some getting used to know when to release the mouse button to swing the weapon. In War Band, TaleWorlds has added more quests and other things to do. Bandit quests are more present, you can get married, the role playing aspect of the game has been improved overall. And the premise of the original game has been preserved as well. Overall, even if you own the first M&amp;B, Warvand is well worth the buy for the added features and I absolutely reccommend it.  100/10 Would recommend to anyone.",

        {
            "review_text": "This is a tough one. Not recommending this title despite wasting many, many hours playing it would seem dishonest...so I'll 'not recommend' it with conditions.  I thought I loved what this game was trying to do but after playing it, I'm not sure even that much is true anymore.  The original Mount &amp; Blade was ground-breaking; Warband was like having having three scoops of ice-cream! I didn't even know that was possible! Viking Conquest is more like your brother's promise to return your stuff in the same condition.  Fortunately, they simply modded the best game ever so in the end, it comes out to a pretty great gaming experience anyway but kind of in a, laughing at a B-movie, sort of way. The language and dialogue options are funny and sometimes infuriating, particularly in the early parts of the story. The odd 'SCRIPT-ERROR' warnings seem like something that should have been fixed long, long before it was ever released.  Just when I get really infuriated with the bugs and glitches, something redeeming will happen and make me love this game...just a little bit. For example, while sailing my fleet along one afternoon, I noticed a lord and his ships stuck on some beach and decided to go have a chat. 'What are you and your men up to?' I asked, pretending it was asked in a rather threatening manner. 'I don't know' was his reply and I nearly spit coffee all over my monitor. I thought to myself 'Fair enough then' and continued on my journey with a smile on my face.  There are quite a few oddities in here but I'll try to touch on the ones that stand out in my mind right now. Very few lords appear to have much interest in women. Not only does this cramp the wanna-be defender of ladies' rights style but it also makes for a harsh world when wives are some of the few people who can give you good directions. This rampant 'bachelorism' is making it really, really hard to find people! It also makes the feasts into veritable sausage-fests.   Then there is the racial 'harmony' aspect. Personally, I find this disconcerting on several levels - primarily, this was clearly a decision someone made because the original game certainly made an effort to be much more inclusive and representative of human populations. Everyone in Viking Conquest is white! Every sailor, wool merchant and mercenary. This is simply ridiculous not only from a realistic viewpoint but from an historical and archaeological one as well. Science, archaeology and the historical record itself all attest to the fact that human beings have met, mingled, traded, fought, bred and cried together since before we ever came down out of our trees.   Then there is the cloning program. Whatever cloning technology the people of Skyrim used to make their children, these folks are using to make tavern hosts. Speaking of women...I always thought Irish women were particualrly beautiful, I never had a clue that there were only about two of them and they both look like they could lift an ox with each hand...while planting a field of wheat and giving birth! Lady Mor...she is strong like traktor. Maybe this is why none of the other lords are interested in marriage? We can't all marry Lady Hild, after all.  I think I'm convincing myself that this is more like a recommendation with conditions, instead?   Many of the changes appear to be made by people I have had discussions with in here before. Those 'my Nord Huskarls can beat your (insert alternate for bestest army ever here)' type of discussions. The ones where after exchanging numerous flaming posts, they finally admit that '...IF there were no horses...and no bows...and everyone had to walk everywhere and hit things...THEN my Nords would win'. So they made a world just like that. Everything that made life a living hell for the poor Nords in Mount &amp; Blade has been removed from the game...or at least its simply much more difficult to have those things. Viking Conquest is the poor Nords swan-song. Even so, it's still pretty awesome and I do appreciate learning a different set of skills in order to enjoy this game. I've been determined to develop my archery just to spite the developers though and by about level thirty, I'm only just becoming sufficiently deadly with it. Of course, it's still the same Strong Long Bow I've had since about level four because there simply aren't any other options in loot, shops or for upgrades.  There is also some evidence of genuine historical love. Place names are particularly interesting for example. How much of it is true or accurate, I would never hazard a guess about but it is fun to try and decipher some of it. Somebody clearly put some thought into it. I'm also curious about this 'Cantiga' song now too.   If you are new to the series and looking for a good, story-driven, RPG-type game then Viking Conquest most certainly is not for you! Consider this more of a battle simulator that doesn't work all of the time. Of the many reported hours put into this title, my guess is that almost all of it went into tweaking the online multiplayer aspects exclusively. The single player parts were obviously left for last and abandoned just prior to release. If your idea of a good story is 'Ima gonna beat up everyone until there ain't no more people to beat up', then disregard everything I've written so far.  The BIG drawbacks include instability first and foremost. Ignore anyone who tells you the game runs fine or that it 'may have one or two bugs', etc. So many people have already written about the exact same problems, the truth of the matter is plain enough for anyone to see for themselves. My game crashing for various reasons has become totally commonplace such that I am in the habit of frequently saving my game because I know it will crash at any moment. When you see code spliced into dialogue options, it's a rather clear indicator that the problems are not originating with the end-users. PEBKAC certainly does not apply in all of these cases, sorry.  Another big one that cannot be overlooked is the rigidly confining mainquest storyline. The player is hamfisted into ridiculous scenarios simply because the writers couldn't be bothered to do any play-testing whatsoever. It can only make sense if you slavishly obey and follow it step by step without ever faltering. Say for example, you think...geez, these guys seem tough, maybe I should go level up a bit before continuning? DON'T do that. I didn't find out that I would be given a free ship until AFTER I'd gone to England, kicked many arses and bought my own boat...and then went back to find out about the main quest...Arrrgh. Later, it gets worse, a certain King expects you to swear an oath of fealty to him and unless you do so, the story simply stalls - I already had a King and I liked him, there is no way I was going to give up all of my towns and castles just to find out what the story says about my mom.   Besides, from what little I could gather about her fate, she seems to be doing rather well for herself. Perhaps that is the biggest tragedy of all with this game? The relationship between the player and their mother is central to the entire quest line and I actually couldn't care less about her. That just sounds horrible, sorry mom. It is true though.  Lastly, I have to bring up religion. What a waste of everyone's time. How wonderful it would be to have the option of playing as a blood-thirsty, Pagan warrior...perhaps one day we'll get that option? This game seems to be about as open-minded about spiritual beliefs as a Baptist Minister might be. The 'Pagans' are murderous beasts spawned from Hell and are punished and hated for merely existing. The Christians are all happy and loving and wonderful. No priest or other Church funtionary is ever involved in anything untoward. 'The Church' is all squeaky-clean, just the way Grandma would want it to be.   I suppose I would recommend this, with reservations.",

(You have to use crossbowmen, or archers to do any damage to people in a siege.)  Also, if you try to start a kingdom, you are suggested to assign one of your companions as representative and magistrate to the kingdom you found. If you lose your last fief (easy to do early on.) your companion is dead and gone forever. No the game doesn't explain this to you when it happens. Go eat a ♥♥♥♥.  Only worth buying if it's on sale.  Viking Conquest:  Told my troops to 'Hold this position.' They promptly ♥♥♥♥ off 500 feet to the west up a mountain backwards and under withering skirmisher fire.  Got this game on sale, and even then it wasn't worth it. Troops just refuse to listen to simple 'Stand here.' orders, even after lumping every unit under the 'infantry' unit tab. Stand here doesn't mean ♥♥♥♥ing moonwalk towards your enemies enmasse. Being posessed with the spirit of Michael Jackson will not save you from incoming missiles.  If you let them split off into spearman and infantry units, they run all over the ♥♥♥♥ing place and don't hold formation, dying to units half their tier. Even if you lump them all into one category, they STILL DON'T HOLD FORMATION. The base game didn't do this ♥♥♥♥, so what the hell?  Buy Viking Conquest if you like giving yourself cancer.  ---------- EDIT----------------  Apparently there's an option in the camp menu to turn automatic unit facing off.  This fixes all the michael jackson moonwalking problems.   I'm still leaving the frustrated rant up though, so people can see how ANGRY I was at this game with this option enabled.

            "review_text": "Having played this game for a little while, I found it to be a challenging, if stupidly fun game. When you begin, you arrive in a new land with not much more than the clothes on your back, but eventually by doing quests and with practice and time, you can become a powerful leader (or a cowardly lion, like me) and lead a band of misfits around the land of Calraidia, helping or hindering the factions and peasants you come across as you please. Its even possible to take over a town- or if thats not enough- fight your way through the opposition to get to the top of the food-chain and become emperor, (not that you have to of course, but always worth a try).   The individual factions are a great idea, with each having their own strengths and weaknesses, this means that if you want a versatile army, you have to travel the land and recruit from villages owned by them. This can bring problems for you though, if the particular 'brand' of unit you want is found only in hostile territory (e.g an area infested with bandits or a faction that is hostile to you.).   Another fun thing with this game is the way that combat works, though it may have a steep learning curve, those who master the various weapons and tactics availible can become unstoppable.....unlesss you come up against 300 Rhodok Crossbowmen, nothing can survive that. Sieges are also a fun aspect of the game, just hope that you have a good axe or bow, keep your head down, and maybe you'll survive long enough to watch all of your allies get wiped out by Vikings :D.  All in all a fun game, just read some of the many guides availible if you want to really do well in the game (I'm pretty terrible myself) but skill isn't required to enjoy it. Just sit back relax, and begin your adventure.",

I got this game about 1 and a half weeks ago, and luckily I had a long break this past weekend, so I got to play this game a lot and enjoyed most of it. This is a really fun game, but it is a little outdated (which should be expected because it was released in 2010).  What is good: Fighting - I enjoyed this more than combat systems in other medieval games, such as Elder Scrolls games or Chivalry Not Fighting - The non-combat aspects of this game were great. You get to manage your troops, villages, and castles. I think you can do some political stuff, but I haven't really tried that too much yet Content - I like games that can keep me occupied for $1 an hour, this game has done this. Mods - So many mods. I've only tried one, which was supposed to enhance gameplay. I haven't played the game without this mod, but I plan to try some more later Music/Audio - I really like the soundtrack for this game, it fits very well with the game's theam Art Style - I really liked it, it reminded me of Age of Empires III  Meh (I'm not really sure if I can mark this as good or bad): The writing - The writing itself is not bad, but there's not enough of it. This means a lot of the text is reused, making a lot of the NPC interactions feel the same.  What's not so good: The graphics - They aren't great (again because this was made in 2010) Grindy - This is probably an effect of the lack of writing. A lot of text and quests are reused making tasks sometimes feel repetitive. Lacks polish - I'm not really sure if I can just chalk this up to being made in 2010 because some of these problems look like they could have been fixed with a few more hours of bug tests and fixes. Some of these problems include:  - Battles not ending, forcing me to restart my game (this only happened once for me)  - The intro video opens, then closes, then the game opens in a new window (I found a way to shut this off online)  - Walking into spikes, instead of killing you, forces your character to be stuck there forever, or until an enemy shoots you to death  - If you walk into a town after finishing a battle, the people in the town (like shopkeepers) will sometimes puch the air or swing their weapon as if they were fighting someone, realize they're not actually fighting someone, then stop.  Stuff I haven't tried yet, but are probably good: Multiplayer (if people still play this game, this seems like it would be fun) The DLC",

Alternatively, realm defense and patrol options are somewhat limited..for example, if I wanted a Lord and his men to sit on a position for an set length of time, laying in wait to ambush my enemy should the opportunity arise, I would like to be able to have them do exactly that.  I guess what I'm hoping is for further development in warfare tactics and strategy..the political maneuverings within the game seem to be on the right track..one's influence upon other lords/ladies is based one controversy and renown, which makes perfect sense. 8/10 ",

What I want to praise is how - in every way except really the combat - Mount &amp; Blade is truer to history than pretty much any other game I have ever played. The developers clearly did their research (either that, or a lot of developers don't do much). The only real exception to this is the Sword Sisters, because a lot of them don't wear helmets (but pretty much everyone else does. Hooray, realism!). It would be a problem that a historically based game had female combatants that were not an extreme exception, but it takes place in a fictional land, and the game gives a very plausible explaination for it. The female player-character also has a harder start as she proves herself, but after she does that goes by the wayside as one would expect would happen in the real world. The attitudes of the lords - while at times basic and repetitive - are a good representation of nobles as well, and are diverse enough in their various forms of self-indulgence and vanity that you can't always tell if it's intended that they be so loathsome. Also there is thankfully no dual-wielding in actual combat (I don't think you can even punch with your left hand), though it might have been interesting to have one of the tournament variants involve it.  I know most people don't really know about or have any interest in the history - if it's not your cup of tea I don't blame you - but for those of us who do it's heartwarming to see that (many if not all) aspects of medieval life can be mostly faithfully represented without tarnishing the gameplay experience.",

One great thing about this game is how it sticks so closely to it's roots. The core is combat. There is something very satisfying about the combat.   Many melee based combat games detach you from the experience, where you click a button and your character performs a physically precise set of movements that constitute an attack. Mount &amp; Blade connects you to the combat like no other game, by factoring in the direction of your swing, height, timing, etc to make it feel so good when a hit connects. Defense is also simple but effective, and balancing your attacks with your defense makes each battle a little chess match.  The rest of the game is fairly straightforward basic RPG, stats enable items, favor enables ownership of land, you eventually stockpile enough money and get a big enough army that it all just comes back to combat.  If you haven't tried this game and you like the idea of a sandbox army mangement and combat game, give it a shot.",

Somehow, even though it would seem like a perfect setting for a video game, we don't have many non-fantasy medieval advetures we can play. Mount &amp; Blade: Warband is that game, the one I've been looking for.  You start as either a male or a female noble or a commoner and it is up to you to work your way up. Being a noble right from the beginning gives you a little boost, but if you choose to start as a peasant, that's fine too, it will just take a bit longer to get a decent army, that won't get slaughtered during the first encounter with the sea raiders. One thing to note would be if you don't like tedious work and grinding in games, avoid this like a plague. It takes about 20-30 hours, depending on your playstyle, to get a respectable army and then you are still very likely to get crushed by one of the members of an opposing kingdom (you can choose a king to serve first as a mercenary and later become his vassal), who has three times as many soldiers as you do, backed up by a couple of his friends. Battles of 70 of your soldiers versus 650 of their's is not rare. But let's say you did it. You worked your way up from being a smelly peasant, through serving as a mercenary, raiding villages for loot that you can get ripped off of by the local merchant, all the way to being a vassal, having your own land (be it a village or a town) and be able to tax those plebs you used to call equals. You have enough honor, or too little of it, you have enough renown and right to rule and your liege recently screwed you over by giving that castle or town you fought so hard over to somebody else, ideally, to himself. That would be the perfect situation for renouncing your allegiance an starting your own kingdom. Becoming a king and maybe, just maybe, an emperor of Calradia is all achiavable in this wonderful game.",

I started out on the wrong foot, I did zero research and made all of the wrong mistakes because I didn't understand any of the game. I believe there was a tutorial but I skipped it. So, i strongly suggest playing a tutorial or researching how skills and diplomacy work.  This is NOT one of those games where you can just conquest, conquest, conquest. You will need time to rest and regroup, train new soldiers and make friends. In this game, having friends can save your empire. I can't say enough good things about it. I have ran in to a few small bugs, but nothing anywhere near game breaking. Visuals are decent, skills and items make a huge difference in combat, especially a versatile army. I'm bouncing everywhere with this review... All I should say is that this game is massively full od depth and... just play the game, you will NOT be disappointed if youre a strategy fan.

            "review_text": "I woke up one morning. It was in my bed, noticing my father coming back to our cottage with only enough denars to buy bread. Lived a poor life, father was a simple farmer, mother, a hometaker, and me. A blacksmith apprentice. Life was tough, but we made it threw. Years later, I set off to live the life of a master blacksmith. I wasnt some petty labourer, I was a craftsmen. Appreciated by the many who buy from me. Easy living I should say. One day I will never forget.. I received a letter. Speaking of my parents being dead. I vowed to find who did it. I set off. I made my self a set of tools and trust worthy sword. I am now an adventurer, and I shall await my journy to present its self. I met a lord. He was a d.ick. He called me scum. I wasn't going to take that so I attacked him being the cocky blacksmith i am. I got one shotted from 50 yards away. I fell unconcous. My tools and my denars being taken away from me i cried. Days later i was freed. I then got attacked by a small group of looters. Slaughtered every one of them. I took what i could and sold it in the market. I visited the arena. Intrested I wanted to fight. So i did. I ended up besting every warrior in the city. Boy i was happy. Grand prize. Only 150 denars. I wasnt satisfied. So i asked the man whens the next tounrnmant. I then set off to so said tounrmant and lucky me there was a feast there. I joined the tournemnet and bested every fighter and lord. I even got revenged on the lord who called me scum. I played with him. Letting him attack me. Then just destroying his noble ♥♥♥♥ up and down the arena. I won. A nice sum of 6000 denars in my pocket. I was noticed in the fighting and was invited to the feast. I talked to all the lords and the king of the Rhodoks. Wanted to be a vassal i did a few petty arrends. Getting my reknown higher, being the word of the time i offered my sword in vassalage. Sadly denied the first time i then killed a group of looters. I went back to him and he granted me vassalage. I was now a lord. But with no men.. I then set off to train troops. Having an army of about 60 i gathered up my men. Feeling cocky i attacked a castle of the Swadians. I won. But my king wouldnt give it to me. So, i rebelled. Took it for my self and called my kingdom Anti-Rhodok. Just to p.iss on his little old face. He gathered up all his men and attacked me destroying my kingdom i raged. A few actual life days later i came back and remembred what he did to me.. I then again, took up arms. Taking one of his lords as prisoner and looting a village i was considred an outlaw. I didnt let me stop me. I then took another castle. One of the Rhodoks. Right after, they signed a peace treaty with me. I kept the castle and then highring some of my fellow companians to be vassals i set off to make a kingdom of my own. I conqured the lands. Using army varieties of all troops from the swadian horses to the veiger archers i was ready to rule Caladria. I finally took it. The final city. The Rhodok capital. Jelkala. Ive finally destroyed that peasent and took him prisoner in my dungeons for eternity. Making sure he is fed worms i finally united all of Caladria. The end. Good game, 10/10. Would rule again.",

            "review_text": "I've played the original Mount &amp; Blade, loved it so much I bought the sequel Warband! Just started playing it again, but also just uninstalled it again. Yes, it's enjoyable, especially the arena fighting, BUT I'm really frustrated because I love the fighting mechanic's but they need a lot of working on, so many schemes to choose from I can't really find the right scheme to give me a decent fight. Blocking is hit or miss when you need those movements to count, especially when you have 3 or 4 AI's targeting you at the same time.  If they improve that mechanic, because there's nothing bugged that I see, just needs improving, to deliver a decent 1 on 1 abiity to send your attack however you intend it to go in whatever direction you want, that goes for blocking as well; I may consider installing it again!  I used to be so good at this game, then I realized maybe it was because the controls may have been set to 'automatic', but that takes the fun out of developing the skill through the mechanic, which I haven't found in any other game.  Another thing they could improve is the Arena, make it more entertaining, such as give us the choice to spawn with what ever weapons we want. I prefer the heavy sword and the bow, as it is now, Arena fighting is as dry as it was in the original game, you'd expect more from a sequel, in the area of creativity.  I can't give the game a bad review because I like the game, and have put countless hours, but I sincerely wish they'd work on the fighting mechanic's so that when you swing your sword it connects where you want to go, and explain the control options for fighting and blocking, rather than just allowing us to pick the options without an understanding of what they do in the options screen.  Block by mouse movement... Block by movement keys... attack b relative position of enemy...  Combat needs to be fluid and you don't have time to study arrows on the screen when you have numerioius ai's attacking you from every direction, I'm thinking the Computer gets confused and doesn't know which enemy I'm engaged with when there are so many swinging at me.  The Bow needs working on too, because I don't like playing with cross hair's on, in real life there are no cross hairs on a bow, it relies on skill, but without the crosshair theres no way to hit anything, because the aiming mechanism isn't accurate as you would expect. It feels almost like a mini-game to get a decent shot off with the bow.  All in all, it's worth a buy, and worth playing if your not broke and want to have some fun, they did a good job with this game.  I want to see this company come up with more ideals, and not just stick with the Mount &amp; Blade concept, because there is a lot you can do with these ideals they are coming up with, like an awesome massive eco simulator, sorta like monopoly, create like a virtual boardgame. This engine, and its' capabilities would put Monopoly to shame!",

I peacefuly wanted to not make eye contact with them, but it was too late. ''I will drink from your scull!''  It was great fight, all of my man fought bravely, but all one by one died. Then i was there. 1 vs 22. They knocked me down with their sharp arrows. I was deafeated. They took my best items. But. I didn't gave up. When i escaped, i attacked them with my club. I killed some, then got imprisioned again. I attacked them once more. Got defeated. I attacked with no armour, no weapons, i managed to kill everyone except for 3 in 6-7 attempts.  My final battle against these ♥♥♥♥♥♥. I was going to get my items back. I was ready. I was going to make them cry! They started to run away. I followed.   I failed. Manhounters were first.

I think i spent 15 minutes chasing a Sea Raider party, perhaps more. When you reach level 63 the game is over because this bug where it shoots you to level 2117 is not all bad until you start quests with bandits and find yourself rebooting your computer. It pours it 2115 bandits over the maximum permitted on the battlefield. You can only imagine the frustration when you game locks up and there is no fix for it. Well, I personally give it a C because it's not new or innovative since the targetting system is crap and inappropiate mouse directional attacks are low responsive to your input to not inputting.   5/10  I honestly expected worse since Paradox Games is King of Half-♥♥♥♥ productivity but it was developed by TaleWolrld whom need a new publisher.

You can be a king, Marry women including you compainions, theres a whole relationship system with it to its pretty cool. You can rule feifs that gives you money every time you pay your troops. Theres a ransoming system others ransom prisioners for money, which is were you will most likely get most of your income from. You can build an massive army, raid villages, seige castles, and even capitols with many cool looking units and huge battles when you start to really get into the game. There are many awesome total converstions of the game, and some make the game worth buying all on its own. I would totally recommend this game to anyone who likes medieval, or renessaince warfare.",

This game... is... the greatest I have ever played. (voice breaks) Oh, my gosh... Ha-ha.

You can be a horrifying guy who leaves the dead to rot and loots villagers or a chivalrous crusader who is also a family man. 10/10. My literal only complaint is the amount of repetitive grind, but combat is interesting enough to keep it from being outright boring. Hack and slash, sell loot, defeat Count Tellrog for the hundredth time, annoy Count Tredian, get King Harlaus angry, provoke Sultan Hakim, beat down on Boyar Belgaru for being an ingrate... yeah.

            "review_text": "This game is pretty darn good for what it does.  Basic idea is that you are a warrior of some kind looking to build your own army, independant or under the banner of one of several kingly type guys. There isnt a whole load of content, its pretty simple, the main feature being the combat and the politics between the warring factions. Theres a ton of problems with the game though, some gameplay and others are more along the lines of flavour and detail  Pros:  Your character can be nicely customised, specifically in character build, you can give your character a ton of health and combat strength or become more of a support character and boost your tactics allowing for more troop advantage or become a surgeon and avoid retraining new Sword Sisters.   You can use a bunch of different weapons, swords, maces, spears, crossbows, longbows. They all have their own strengths and weakness, personally, be thing to do, double handed sword and a horse and just chop guys down with one strike. It always felt the most kingly type thing to do.       As much as I like this game, I have a lot of negative things to say about it.  Cons:  Its a bit plain, its just plain. So, among the the several factions, there are a ton of Lord characters, that basically control a portion of each of the factions armies. There are a ton of them and fairly forgetable. But they dont come across as very dynamic or interesting. You're going to fight a lot of them and you'll kill them in battle a ton of times but they never actually die, they just manage to escape and run away to heal and try to fight you again. They all have their relationship trees though, they have daughters and sisters and brothers and fathers and wives and uncles and whatever else, but they never really say much more interesting things. I sort of wish they were randomly generated, so then at least if you could kill one someone new could take their place and it would be a bit more interesting since it would damage the faction they were in.    Siege battles are pretty ♥♥♥♥. Any zombie game where you're trapped in a room and all the zombies are trying to get through the only door but you can shoot them down as they pour into your room, would be a basic explantion of defense. Attacking is a bit more fun I suppose, but you still have to wait for your troops to get in first.  Regardless, they could be a ton better, unfortunatly, they only seem to allow for one point of attack and its seems to be more of a battle of how many people you're going to sacrifice for a city or castle.    Graphically, its not horrible though I am forgiving when it comes to graphics. I think its environments are better to look at than character models.    There are like 2 different voice actors for this game :C you're gonna hear the same caveman grunts over and over and over.     Its pretty shallow and you'll definitly want more from it which is why the mods are vital to truely enjoy this game. The combat and character progression are fun enought that I've kept playing for a few years now, (a bit over 200 hours at the time of writing). Its a bit of a diamond in the rough and a good one at that if you can tolerate the short comings.",

Though there is no defined storyline like in most RPGs, this is where the sandbox aspect comes into play; you, the player character, are free to do whatever you choose. If you get bored of singleplayer, there is also multiplayer; it involves fighting in a number of game modes (the most popular ones I've seen are typically team deathmatch and siege in Native).  The DLCs are alright and you can buy them if you wish. Napoleonic Wars takes place during said era and is strictly multiplayer. Viking Conquest takes Native Warband and places it in the real world; instead of Calradia, the game takes place during the Dark Ages (868 is the starting date, I believe) in western Europe (France, Denmark, and the British isles.  However, the most important part of Warband is the mods. There are numerous mods for this game that can be downloaded for free. They come in numerous forms, but they all enhance replayability with their own unique attributes. You can't truly experience Warband until you start playing with mods.  Overall, you should give it a shot. If you're not convinced, just look at the other reviews. Download the demo if you're still cautious. In the end, it really is a great game that you should enjoy. 10/10",

This game uses mouse movement to control your players' attacks and defenses (unless otherwise toggled), unlike any other game in this genre (with the exception of the War Of Roses). The singleplayer and the multiplayer are two different experiences using the same combat system. Singleplayer is the more complete RPG exerience, with customizable armies, companions, nations, entirely open map, and an unforgiving, uncaring world. (Quite realistic.) Multiplayer is mostly combat, with the exception of a customizable avatar and what you bring into combat (essentially your loadout). This game almost reaches it's full potential if you're willing to modify it (singleplayer, anyways).  PROS: Extensive RPG experience, Original combat system, Singleplayer/Multiplayer, Large &amp; active playerbase, realistic, Globally played, Difficulty is easily adjusted, Entirely Open Word, Decent price, Almost 2 games in 1.  CONS: O.K. graphics (This isn't Skyrim, folks), Tendancy to house Bugs, Glitches, and other Parasites, , Difficult to learn, Addictive ; )  In CONCLUSION, this game is worth picking up if you're a true RPG/Fighting fan. On Steam you can grab the entire series for $8-$15.",

There's a well-known memory leak that causes the game to crash. At first, it'll occur after several hours' gameplay and doesn't intrude too much. You can actually see it coming as the graphics start to glitch, and save before it's too late. But as you get further into the game and (presumably) your save file takes up more space, it happens more and more quickly. With over 300 in-game “days” under my belt, I can play for barely a couple of minutes.  The “MacOS and Linux” thread in the discussions has been full of reports of this bug for months (it also makes it hard to run the DLC at all), and nothing has been done. I've been holding off posting a “not recommended” review in the hope that it might be fixed. But I give up. It's obvious the devs don't care.  So, a word to other developers: It's great that we're finally getting decent games on Linux, but this kind of half-hearted attempt does more harm than good. If you're not prepared to  support  Linux, we'd honestly prefer you didn't release for it in the first place.  Brilliant game, terrible port.",

I think it's partly because what's drawn on the screen bears so little resemblance to what the game thinks is happening, partly because the input scheme is so awkward and counterintuitive, and partly because the mechanical assumptions behind the combat don't make sense. Someone is attempting an overhead cut, and the ONLY option you have is to block overhead? You can't swipe it out of the way sideways? You can't sidestep? And you have to click AFTER directional input rather than during, as you would if your mouse was the sword?

I could have tolerated the very outdated graphics (the screenshots on the store page actually look a lot better) if it weren't for the other issues I have encountered in my short playtime.  - Terrible AI/Pathfinding: I was fighting a band of bandits almost alone while 18 out of 20 of my men were spazzing up and down a cliff (instead of using the path).  - Horrible Animations that can't decide if they prefer to twitch around or play in slow motion, making it really hard to gauge what's about to happen. It also seems very counter-intuitive where a hit of your own is going to land.  There's also bad camera control, lack of rudimentary quality-of-life features and a nasty interface.  All in all I feel that if a game advertises active combat in an NPC army you lead (cool idea), then animations and AI should be a lot more polished. Nicer graphics also wouldn't hurt the enjoyment.",

Graphics were bad, but if I wrote this review in 2010, I think I will strongly recommend this game.  Hopefully an improved version of large medieval warfare games can arrive in Middle East with better graphics.

Midway through the singleplayer game (after about 80 days) there is a bug where all of the in-game currency disappears, all of the items disappear from the stores, your character's face is warped, all of the lords and ladies are suddenly your husbands, many of the important AI are either gone or glitched out and many times your screen is filled with code errors in red text. So all of those hours you spent building your army are wasted as the game becomes unplayable. I am not the only one with this issue and there is no solution that I have found. I have twice tried contacting Taleworlds regarding this issue but have received no response.

            "review_text": "I've played the hell out of this game. Though usually while stoned out of my mind so it's easy to just laugh and have fun. When playing totally sober though, the problems shine through. I should mention I'm talking about multiplayer only. The single player campaign is, meh, horrible. The towns feel 100% lifeless as do all the people including the NPCs you'll recruit.   Back to the multi... Big problems are archers and the feinting system. You can feint an attack, which takes time to learn to do well. The problem I have with it is that it looks stupid. The characters half swing the weapon, so it looks like a baseball player not taking a full swing at a ball, and not a sword fighting feint. I don't think this was intenional by the game designers, and was more or an expliot that was learned early on. 'Good players' will feint a lot, and look like morons. They'll kill you though, so you should learn the stupid ♥♥♥ feint so you don't just die ughh.  Then there's the Archers. Horse archers are the worst. They can simpy gallop at a slow speed ahead of you and continue to shoot arrows, while all you can do is die, or disengage them and hope they just go after someone else. Like regular archers, they're usually pretty idiotic in that they usually just stand still. Archers will spawn and immedietly just look for targets. This makes it easy to kill them because you can usually just walk right up to them and stab them, because they're never paying any attention to anything around them. Just spawn, shoot shoot shoot die, repeat. This makes being an archer boring, and killing archers even more boring. Sometimes you'll find some elite player being an archer which is hellish. They'll do the shooting game, BUT they actually pay attention and will pull a sword on you, and then, yup baseball feint you to death. This just comes off as them being cocky 'look at me, yeah, I'm just here leasurely killing people from afar but oh, hello there, let me show you how awesome I am by kicking your ♥♥♥ as an archer hahahaha'....   People complain sometimes of Cav players taking cheap shots like archers, but the Cav still have to come right up to you to kill you. Its much more personal and you have a chance to defend yourself if you were paying attention and didnt let them sneak up on you. No such luck with archers. Youll be walking and then just dead. A problem with this is that were's no cap on how many archers there can be, so if theres enough of them, things get really boring really fast, except for the archers which get a kick out of it.  Things would be good if the creators did anything with the game, but they don't. I believe they're making another which probably has their focus. So no changes ever happen. No fixes to the problems. These are my personal issues with the game, though I'm sure plenty feel similarly. Something like spawn killing is something I'm sure everyone despises but once again, will never change. In the Arena map, some archers will sit in a spawn area and just shoot newly spawned players, OR spawn, walk outside the spawn and then just do their sitting there thing. Never taking more than a few steps outside of where they themselves spawned before just shooting and shooting before some just walks up to them and kills them.   SO, play if you smoke weed. Which I do, and will be doing right about now before I go back to playing the god damn multiplayer. Like I mentioned earlier, I have played the hell out of the game. TONS of potential and the best swrod fighty sort of game out there. Way better than Chivalry or whatever those other complete horse ♥♥♥♥ games are.   ♥♥♥♥, so I should mention the mods. Like Brytenwalda. That is SO MUCH BETTER for single player. Like holy ♥♥♥♥, if you're gonna do the single player thing, just get that.

The native UI and UX is absolutely horrid. Menu choices don't make a whole lot of sense, and my god, is item management horrible. I played with the Floris mod and that made the game much, much more enjoyable.  Sadly though, the Mac and Linux versions experience frequent bugs and crashes. If you're on a PC, it might work for you, and in that case, go for it if it's on sale. But stay away if you're on a Mac/Linux. The game crashes every hour or so, which forces you to play with autosave. That doesn't sound so bad, but the game is unforgiving if you stop paying attention, or get a little too comofrtable. You can go from being a rising lord with a badass army right back to square one. If you have autosave enabled, you can either deal with those consequences, or do a force quit, reload and load a previous save. Starting over wouldn't be so bad, but all the other armies in the game have been progressing right along with you, so this can really be a game ender, especially if you didn't amass enough gold to get re-established. Oh, and there's no way to turn that off once you create your character.  I am usually pretty forgiving about bugs in games and don't normally write negative reviews because of them. If a game is still in early access, or the developers are still working on it, I'll give them a pass. However, I haven't seen anything in the way of an update for this game, and from what I can tell from the forums, the devs have been/should be aware of these crashes for about a year and a half, as of writing this. I know they're currently working on M&amp;B Bannerlords, so I have little faith this game will ever get patched.  It really is a shame, because this game has so much potential. I understand that PCs are better for gaming, but if you're going to sell a game on a platform, you'd better gorram support that platform.
