            "review_text": "Since this game has many reviews relating to how it is as a casual game, I would like to look at it from a speedrunner's perspective, since much of this game seems to revolve around that part. I've spent almost all of my time on this game speedrunning it rather than trying to go through and 100% the game, so I feel like this would help people looking for something fast to play.  To begin, this is basically platformer, except you get to fly around so there's no actual platforming involved. Much of the challenge comes from a few enemies and obstacles scattered around. The amount may vary from no enemies and only a couple thorny bushes to 50 lasers shooting at you at once. Each map is a course where you must go through rings to complete the level.   This game offers fairly simple movement in the form of flight that is nice for casual runs, but it can be very fun to utilize to its full potential in speedrunning. This is obviously subjective, but the movement is extremely fluid, making it so the only reason why a person would fail would be due to their own ability.   Once you move into the actual level design, that's when things get a bit murky. I don't want to talk badly about the levels since anything can be speedran if you put effort into it, but some are extremely difficult and require a great deal of time and patience to do at the speed of top runners. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it is something to think about if you're just looking for a fun and easy game to run. This game focuses quite a bit on ILs, so getting top times on each level could take quite awhile. I would say there is massive variety in the levels so I would also let that be known.  This game offers a ton of things to collect in each level if anyone ever wanted to attempt to speedrun 100%, so that's a plus for dedicated people looking for some replay value. I wouldn't say it's to the point of obnoxiousness, but some of the levels are fairly difficult to 100% complete, which is where the speedrunning part becomes a lot more challenging to master.   Overall, I think this is an excellent game with an active community and plenty of room to improve on. It has simple mechanics that take time to master and a hefty amount of content to explore, which is great for people looking for a lot of replay value.",

            "review_text": "Great and simple puzzle game with tons of skins that make solving time tests and finding secret areas all the funner. Great game for the young ones too.  Bought for my 4 year old and he loves it. Controls are simple and limited, though the game can still get pretty challenging at times... I can say that it was a little to hard to resist giving him a hand on some of the harder sections when he asked and I actually had a lot of fun with it too.  I also liked how you got awards for completing levels quicker, which can be tricky and dying can even be a strategy for speed at times. My son liked changing the avatar up by buying new heads and stuff - and there are A LOT.",

Pros: - Great soundtrack - Good boss fights - Colourful graphics - Customizable HQ and character - Local CO-OP and Arena mod  Cons: - In a few level,there's FPS drops - You need stars to proceed further levels,and sometimes it's hard to earn it - Sometimes the leves are a bit hard",

That being said, I've only played for about an hour and a half and I love it. It's a great game if you've got 30 minutes to spare, or need something to do while another game loads/matchmakes.  This game probably isn't for everyone, but if you think that you do fit into the criteria above, I'd confidently say that this game is a good pickup.",

All the places he visits has a ton of gold coins and the occasional gold rings he has to fly through in order to beat the level. Sometimes whenever he's bored he'll change his outfit and skin color because why not? He's an intergalactic dinosaur trying to save dinokind from extinction.  It's rad.",

            "review_text": "I can fullhearthly recommend this game. I clocked almost 10hrs so far without any co-op or another difficulty and im still not finished. The game really reminded me of Blues Brothers from the SNES sometimes. You have your basic abilities at your hand and need to get good with them to beat every level and get every star. You will rage a lot but mostly due to your own failure in timing or wrong technic in using the abilities you have at your command. I noticed that first hand as I progressed further into the game, at first some time based stars in the earlier levels were impossible to get for me but later on I just breezed through them as I mastered Rex movements more and more. There will be challenge, but dont be afraid to take it. Play with a controller, warm up and then attempt the star you want to get. All stars are possible as far as I noticed, some require strategy but that is expected.  I hope I get to play the co-op based modes (race and normal adventure).  The only negative I could think of might be story related. But a game like this doesnt need a lot of story, the old SNES games never had a lot of story and carried their weight purely on the mechanics as does JumpJet Rex.",

Before my friend moved away, the developer was kind enough to deliver me a key for JumpJet Rex. I introduced the game to my friend, and he instantly fell in love with it. JumpJet Rex has many factors to why it's such an amazing game. Here are some things.  - A shop to customize your dinosaur - Very well made - Online scoreboards that you can beat with a friend - Fun levels - Fun bosses - Great soundtrack  The only bad thing about JumpJet Rex is that the game is faily short.  In a nutshell, I rate this game 8/10.",
