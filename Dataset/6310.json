I've only recently discovered the universe behind this and Dreamfall and as a real sucker for good stories, I went for the first one in the saga. It blew my god damned mind. You play as April Ryan, an unknowing savior of the two worlds that had been split ages ago. She is able to cross the border between them and is able to fully interact with both of them. You'll meet dozens of interesting people and creatures that are fairly believable and likable. You'll be solving some really tough puzzles that don't compare with what's called puzzle now-a-days. Some mysteries which don't make any sense in the beginning will be revealed and fit so perfectly in the story at the end. Other mysteries stay concealed until now and keep thousands of fans excited for more. I highly recommend playing this one before jumping to the newer Dreamfall games. I give this game the ultimate rating   10/10    In fact, I loved the game so much that I made a complete walkthrough   guide  to it, feel free to check it out if you're seriously interested in buying this game because the tasks can get very confusing sometimes.",

            "review_text": "My review will only show the amount of hours (very few at time of posting) I've played this on steam, but don't let that fool you into thinking I've never played this game. I've just recently re-discovered it on Steam during the winter sale and couldn't be more excited.  This literally was the first PC game I ever purchased with my own money back in '99. Entire evenings and weekends and school breaks were devoted to this game.  I forgot the name of it years after losing one of the discs (the monster 4 disc collection to install it back then) and used to ask people all the time if they had heard of this game. None had, so I figured I was out of luck.  Yeah, the graphics are dated, but it's still a beautiful game. The voice-acting is phenomenal for the time and pulls you in.  I'm so excited to start the journey over again, this time with my boyfriend watching as I play and getting interested in the lore as well. This type of game is not his 'genre', but he will sit and watch me go through it like he's viewing a movie, and pretty much, that's what this game is good about doing. It's a slow moving movie, with a great plot and characters that you help move along.  I even remembered the rubber ducky outside the window right off! That's how long lasting this game stays with you. I loaded the game, went through the opening sequence, and as soon as April was in her apartment I declared 'There is a rubber duck outside this window that I have GOT to get right now!'  I'm not a puzzle person, at all. So that aspect of the game has always had me pulling my hair out, but I'm excited to take this game on as a 30 year old and not as impatient 14 year old, who'd give up and find a guide online to just get through it.  Long story short: If you love point-and-click stories. Get this one. It is most definitely my favorite of all time. Right after that, find Syberia and Syberia II. They're another series of point-and-click adventure games that I thought were from this same developer and they were very close to the style of The Longest Journey.",

I absolutely had to finish the story, and I was not disappointed.

Unfortunately, it does show its age compared to some of the other adventure games, which was the problem for the early 3D games that weren't extremely stylized like Grim Fandango or The Neverhood (both worth checking out).  However, once you can get past the low poly characters and the resolution being what it is, it's very easy to become fully immeresed in the game. That's when the voice acting and story quickly come to the forefront, and you will realize that this game is easily on par with many of the modern games. It's rating is completely is justified.  For only 10$, this game is a steal.",

It is nothing like these newer games which revolve around forgettable characters and sexual connotations/strong graphic scenes or violence. This is a classic adventure from the time when games had soul and you were expected to pay attention to the story for the game to make sense.  The conversations are funny, sad and feel real. The puzzles aren't too complicated and won't drive you to look up walkthroughs or drive you so insane as to forget about the story or the game all together, but they are complicated enough to make you use your brain and not think the creators made this for imbeciles. In this game you don't have to worry about dying or making a fatal error, this is a casual mood and story based adventure for all of us who don't feel like being tense throughout the game. The controls are, as one would expect, very simple. In my pre-Steam era I've played through this game at the very least 50 times, and I'm not exaggerating. I believe I will play it at least as much times now I've gotten it on Steam.",

The important part is that it's fun! The puzzles aren't that hard to figure out either so it's not one of those frustrating puzzle games.  In regards to characters... I only like 3 characters, including the main character, April. The other characters aren't as endearing or impactful, I suppose.  The ending was a bit lackluster and didn't offer much closure, so I can't wait to play the sequel. 8/10 would recommend you playing this game though!",

If you like (old) point and click games like me, you got to get yourself a touchscreen laptop as point and click and touchscreen are a match made in heaven.

Puzzles are pretty logical, and not very difficult. Death is impossible. But none of that is the reason you want to play this game.  TLJ has one of the most incredible stories ever told in interactive format. It's like playing through an epic-length novel in 15 or 20 hours of gameplay. The voice cast is outstanding from front to back. The lead character, April Ryan, is likable and intelligent, and by the end of the game, you'll feel like you know her, and you'll be sorry to see her go at the end of the game. Despite being dialogue-heavy, this game is never boring. The plot advances with every puzzle solved, every character spoken to. The cultures of two entire worlds are brought into conflict through April Ryan.  April is an art student in a slightly-dystopian, near future version of our world, a high-technology two-class society. Magic doesn't exist there any more than it does in real life. But April gets involved in a complicated plot that finds her being trapped in a parallel universe on a world called 'Arcadia,' where magic is real, and technology is sparse. April occasionally goes back and forth between worlds, and even into space, in order to save Arcadia and her own world, and in the process learns a lot about herself.  Best $10 you could spend on Steam. ",

You can run it in a windowed mode, but unfortunately there's no option to increase the resolution.  There were some parts in the game that lacked a sense of direction, I found myself getting frustratingly stuck at least a handful of times.  Still, it was all worth it for such a fantastic title.",

Then and now the graphics don't hold up terribly well, but considering that it was launched in 2000 I'd say it's not that bad. However even now the voice acting, story and dialogue are still fantastic after all this time and it's in these areas that Longest Journey truly shines. Like a good book you can't put down, I was sucked into the story immediately and hardly noticed the time passing until looking at the clock to see that it was the middle of the night. The themes are mature and intelligent, the dialogue extremely well crafted, and the characters believable. I almost feel like I need to exhaust all dialogue options because I want experience all of it and to see what the characters say and do in each situation.  It still has faults in the same way that point and click games usually do - the solution for the puzzles are sometimes opaque, or sometimes you know what you need to do but you're pixel-hunting to find where exactly you're supposed to click - but these are problems with the genre and not this particular game. However, there are relatively few of these genre-related problems given how long ago this game was launched.  The one glaring problem that may make this game unplayable for some people is the graphics - if you can't stand fairly blocky character models and low-res textures then this may not be the game for you (just check out the screenshots on the store page to get a good idea). Out of all the re-make games coming out, this is a game that deserves an HD remake. Once you look past the aging graphics however, you will be transported to an incredibly detailed world with an inventive mixture of fantasy and sci-fi in this excellent story.  9.5/10",

For a title almost 15 years old, some elements of course have become dated - the pre-rendered cutscenes are a clean giveaway - but Ragnar Tornquist's ability for story telling more than makes up for this. He created a universe of two worlds where The Longest Journey tells a great story and lays the groundwork for further developments. Dreamfall neatly expands on this and as of Q4 2012 it is clear that he will work on continuing the story in Dreamfall Chapters. If you are a fan of adventure games and you can appreciate a good story development I would recommend The Longest Journey. It's a great game in and of itself and if you have become involved into the world and characyers, you can continue your experience in the sequels.",

The protagonist April is a lovable character, and the voice acting really makes her seem like that she could be a real person. The game starts out pretty slowly as you learn everything about yourself and the world around you, but it picks up. Some of the puzzles can be a bit obscure, but it doesn't take away from the story.

I remember playing Sierra's Torrin's Passage when I was a child, and this game hit me with an extra large dose of nostalgia. When it comes to point-and-clickers, The Longest Journey dominates the field and is a classic staple that all people interested in the genre should definitely check out.  If you like point-and-clickers, expansive storylines, and challenging puzzles, then you will really enjoy this game.  The aesthetics are good, but the graphics are very, very dated. Despite this, the environment and the examinable items (in your inventory) remain well-detailed.The character models are a bit lacking, and this is most evident during cutscenes. The music and ambient sounds are approporiate for the themes presented throughout the game, The story is slightly convulted, but also fairly easy to follow if you take the time to read/listen to the dialogue. Your character records her thoughts in a diary, and these can be helpful for summarizing key details and better understanding the story. Each interactable character provides a good amount of backstory and lore. The voice acting is great, but I personally find the main character's voice a bit irritating.  The controls are simple and typical of a pount-and-clicker. There is no tutorial - you are simply dropped into the game, however, it is easy to pick up how to play if you experiment for a few minutes. The learning curve id minimal to moderate - the most difficult thing so far being item combinations (a number of the possible item combos are not obvious). I've also picked up A LOT of items, but their value and use have not yet been determined in my playthough.   The game and story are very cool - the main theme centralizes around two worlds (the magic and non-magic worlds) that can be traversed through 'shifting,' or moving through portals. At the end of each chapter, you are usually presented with a choice of two options, each potentially moving the story in a different direction. Much of the game involves you combining items and giving them to people, or using them to get more items. You can also 'look' at certain items in your inventory, and experimenting with clicks on different areas may yield a new item added to your stash.   You can press 'x' to show all the exits in an area, and this is useful if you don't want to scan with your mouse for different exit points. There is a metro train system, where you can travel to other unlocked areas freely.  Overall, this game provides a very good point-and-click experience, and I suggest you give it a try if you are interested in that particular type of gameplay. The story is well-written and pretty expansive, so you will be spending a lot of time reading/listening to dialogue (all skippable).  Recommend!  Cheers, DJSF  @DJSF's Rogue Reviews ",

It is filled with great ideas, interesting well written characters, and a wonderfully immersive world for players to dive into. If you are a gamer who cares about a great story in your games, this is one not to miss.  The gameplay, as you would expect, is of the classic point-and-click type, mainly focusing on talking to various characters, picking up and interacting with various objects, and using those objects in various combinations to solve a range of puzzles to progress the story. In truth, many of the puzzles in this game are obtuse to the point of being annoying, but there are plenty of walkthroughs around if you don't want to beat your head against them and want to simply enjoy the wonderful story. Given that the game was originally released in 1999, its graphics have aged quite badly, even through they were lauded at the time for being pretty cutting edge. Fortunately, point-and-click adventures do not depend heavily on fancy graphics to be playable, so its not a gamebreaking issue. The music and voice acting however, stand up very well, and once you get used to the dated graphics the game remains immensely enjoyable. Given the insignificant price you can get this game for these days, its well worth the investment if you love a good story.",
