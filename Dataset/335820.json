Leveling here is not quick (unless you grind endlessly like a mad man every single day)  DoMo is very casual and social. You can level up by either doing quests or grinding (but mostly grinding). There is no dungeons in this game. I repeat, there is no dungeons! (although there are raids for guilds)  Don't feel like leveling today? It's okay, DoMo still has something for you!  Hunt for recipes,  Complete treasure maps, Conquer the market with your mysterious stall, Join PvP matches at the arena, You can even pet play in the Guild Cottage.  That's right, there's an actual Guild Cottage Where you can hang out and access your bank amongst many other things.   I've tried 23 other mmos this year and DoMo still beats them all for me, So come give it a shot!  It's free~ ",

The endless combinations of jobs and sub jobs is fantastic. Like most MMOs there are parts where it's grindy and parts where levels fly bye. The graphics aren't as realistic as other games, but the cartoonishness adds to the games character and charm. With hundreds, even, thousands, of costume pieces and combinations, you can easily make your character your own. Make friends, join a guild, never have to choose 1 job ever again!

If you don't have friends to play with and aren't looking to socialize with this game's playerbase, then this game isn't for you -- solo play becomes a grindy, arduous chore and all but the most dedicated MMO players will grow bored before hitting Lv. 20, and oftentimes the sluggish feeling is only mitigated by purchases from the currently-lackluster Item Mall.  If you're a socialite and tend to stick around to play with friends and meet new ones, then you'll be all over this game for sure. Partying up for a good grind is much more enjoyable -- relaxing between punching sessions nets some fun conversations and memorable moments, and joining a guild makes for the opportunity to establish real connections with some of these people. While the in-game social structure isn't used quite as much as it was intended (to my knowledge), it certainly lives up to its promise of emphasis on social interaction.",

            "review_text": "Solid game play progression with fair difficulty curve. Friendly community (with its fair share of bad apples)- generally speaking, if you ask questions in the 'broadcasting channel', which broadcasts across the entire map to all players, multiple people will answer your question *expect at least 1 troll response. Tutorial is short and barely covers the basics. A once unique job system, copied over time (this game is over 10 years old, brought back from the dead) that allows 14 different classes to be leveled INDIVIDUALLY, while also utilizing the power you gained with the 'sub skills'. I.E. you level your doctor to 30, you can switch to your level 10 mercenary and opt to keep your healing skills. Each job class (minus commoner) has a variety in how you play it. Martial artist can use staff attacks or gloves, Mecenary can use a spear (team play) or an axe + shield (solo play), etc.  Decent late game available currently, not all that is available, but a good variety to keep players interested. If you are willing to look past the incredibly dated graphics of the 'gamecube era' of games (early 2000's) you are in for a treat!  Very solid game that only recently got revived, and for good reason. Definitely worth looking into if you want a solid Free to Play MMORPG with light Pay to Win aspects. Pets, slight armor / weapon upgrades (double gold), experience and item drop rate boosters are some of the things in the item mall; the Pay to Win aspect is very minimal at the given moment.  Solid game for casual or hardcore gamers.",

I won't deny that the people who love this game very clearly grew up with it as I did, and it was a shame that Aeria cancelled publishing it before we could fully enjoy it.   HOWEVER.   The memories I have of this game are a prime example of the term 'nostalgia blinded'. I was overjoyed to hear that someone had began publishing the game again, and eagerly downloaded it. Needless to say, I only downloaded the steam version afterwards to write this review. As the game is nothing I remembered it to be.  The UI and controls are crazy asinine and clearly haven't been updated since its original publication many years ago. The class system, while diverse, has lots of really dumb out-of-the-way requirements for getting certain classes. The stat system is impossible to figure out before you hit the cap that allows for free resets on your own, hence why the game has to link to the damned wiki in the first place, and even then you're not gonna be 100% happy with your stat build.   The story is a product of its time, quickly written and thrown in just for the sake of saying it has one. And the gameplay consists of near nothing but quests containing 'Kill this thing until you're ready to get the quest where you kill its palette-swaps. Maybe get a party and kill a boss or two.'   As much as I loved DOMO back in the day, playing it now makes me firmly believe that it should have stayed dead.",

            "review_text": "So, I played this game for half an hour; after playing it way back in the day. A lot has changed since then; unfortunately games like this have not. In addition to the very stiff controls {I'm not talking movement which can be changed in the Options with the WASD toggle}; I found that the game pace was very slow. So I settled on playing through what I thought was a good pace, following quests; killing level equivalent monsters; etc. I only found out that this is not the best way to level to the point of acquiring your first job and in fact adds on another 30-40 minutes of un-necessary exposition and needless gameplay. But that can be overlooked; because let's face it, no game company wants their games considered to be fast paced anymore.    But that wasn't what bothered me; what actually bothered me was the somewhat estranged fact that despite having a Quest Tracker up; none of the quests I had gotten would add or could be added to it. It was just a big ol' block. So I constantly have to open my Map just to see where I am going next. I even paid attention to the information the NPCs stated.    I also noticed the majority of the models had yet to be updated to what DOMO was like just before the shut down. So, if anything; this could be called what DOMO was a good year before it actually ended. Also, does anyone else find it odd that the text is some sort of binary but doesn't fit on most of the bars and descriptions; or it is just me?",

            "review_text": "I don't have a full hour yet, but I decided to go ahead and make a review because of one thing regarding this game:  The initial impression. Read the whole thing before you go 'well, what do you know, with only one hour?'  Upon starting the game up, it tells you to link your account with their site. That's fine, whatever. The big issue is the fact that the game's resolution is automatically set at a messed up number (couldn't tell you what one, exactly), and you can't change this, until you get in game. In fact, there are no options settings at all at the inital menu, and they are only visible once you get in game.  Besides that point, there is also the fact that the music, for whatever reason, is automatically muted, and you have to turn this on as well. Even after the music is turned on, it's still kinda wonky, and doesn't loop very often, so you'll have a thirty-second period of music, then another few minutes of silence (not counting the attacking sound effects).  Character creation is a joke, and I don't know if this was done the way it was AS a joke, or if they weren't finished with it, and never got around to fixing it. You can give your character a large head, and make them taller, shorter, thinner, or fatter. You then have a handful of hairstyles and even less hair colors to pick from. The races seemed interesting, but not too terribly to get me to pick something besides human.  While on the subject of characters, the motions are kinda weird. They don't seem broken, but they don't seem too fluid from time to time. The motions themselves are just weird, and it's hard to explain them without seeing them. Basically, they seem a little bit under par for the course, in regards to them.  Humor is kinda bland. The game tries to throw it in, but it's too forced.   Now, some long term player might say 'it gets better at level 15/20/30!' and that may be so, but when you're looking at this game, which is still free of course, against something that did the same thing, such as Mabinogi or Dragon Nest, and did it better, why would you waste your time on this?   The game is rather outdated, that's a given, but there is still a lot about the game that would have been pretty poor, even when it was released.   So, if you're looking for an anime MMORPG (or any new MMORPG for that matter), I wouldn't look here, unless something shifts in the game's favor.  ",

This game was released in 2005 (NA: 2007).   The controls are made to make you angry. Basically everything is CTRL-***. Why? I have no idea. The combat is basically as follows, it's very complicated, so take the time to grasp what is happening: STEP 1-CLICK ON ENEMY; STEP 2-WAIT.

This game has a very simple yet complex class system that is utilized well in the later levels, a pet system that is my absolute favorite, and an easier dungeon type setting makes the anime themed world seem real.
