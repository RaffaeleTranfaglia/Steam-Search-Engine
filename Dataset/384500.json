            "review_text": "I haven't played it for long yet but the concept is obvious. You know that horrible phone game that is supremely well made and charges you out the ♥♥♥ for upgrades? You know what I mean. That one action game that got past your radar because it's got everything you want - mindless fun, internal consistency to the classes of enemies that lets you make up little stories for them in your head while you play, beautiful animation.  Of course, it was a phone game, so there was a catch - the little spaceman outfit you thought would be so cute was $20 of hard-earned cash. And let's not even talk about what it cost you to get that sniper rifle - you'd have to do the walk of shame out of the room while your friends laughed at your dejected rear end. (Yes, your butt would be dejected too. It's attached to the person who spent $99 to play their game, the way they wanted.)  Zombie Party is that game. Minus the butt of shame. Well made, perfectly animated, would be in classic videogame toplists if it was made 25 years ago. Just some shooting, satisfying booms, careful adrenaline flow (some crazy parts, some less so), and strategy to boot. Pop it in, play it for five minutes, and your sleepy eyes will turn into bright awake and with a smile.  It's like an energy drink as a video game, but with lots of customization and no real money to have to spend after you buy it.",

            "review_text": "Honesly, Zombie Party just a really good bullet hell game. Sure the online play is a bit buggy at the moment, but it's fun and has plently of content for a nice price. It has a large and colorful cast of characters, customizable (and unique) weapons, a variety of pets, and even a magic system. In addition, the game features a leveling/stat mechanic that allows you to talior your character to your preferred playstyle on the fly.  'But wait,' you say, 'This genre thrives on simple but hectic fun and all this sounds complex. Surely this bogs down the gameplay.'  And it's true that there is an absurd amount of stuff packed into this seemingly simple game, but it's all to the point. Weapon upgrades do what they say on the can. Stats are also straightforward. The bombs, magic, and items you pick up are also self-explanatory. The overall effect of all this is a sense there is more meat to the game. Theres more diversity in how you play and more you can customize to how you play. Which is a nice break from the normal progression of gun -&gt; bigger gun -&gt; biggest gun  Zombie party also features several game modes. From the rougelike dungeon mode, to the traditional bullet hell pvp of deathmatch, to the classic arcade mode.  On the downside, it has occasional dips in performance, and online play is a bit iffy. They don't distract from the overall enjoyment though.   If you want something that you can pick up and play anytime while still having a large amount of content to earn and unlock this is the game for you.",

Amazing stuff, lots of weapons, customisation in and out of game, loot, magic, tons of ennemies, local multiplayer (up to 4 players) and now no more slow time due to the mess on the screen. This game is so good ! It's hard to find any default : the lovely old school design matche so well, the sound is great (♥♥♥♥ing good music ! ) ... it's one of my best games !",

            "review_text": "This game is beyond awesome! First lets get the cons out of the way. 1. you will spend way too much time playing it. 2. you may become upset at the sheer number of customisation options available to you and be sad that you cant have them all. 3. All jokes aside there is one huge problem I found playing this game I got to 'you will die' skill setting and was killing everything as normal and then the game froze and crashed due to my spread/split/firerate bomb machinegun the game just could not keep up with the projectiles/damage numbers and crapped its pants causing me to lose 2-3 hours of farming for gold and my damn high score! lol   the pros  1. guns/guns/more guns/ and then GUN MODS FOR EVERY SITUATION 2. fast paced fighting that reminds me of the good old amiga days 3. playing with friends is easy  4. peachpiegames joined my game #blessed lol 5. the bosses are tough even though they are not very unique in attack patterens  6. a mod that lets you fire cheese burgers like for real I took down a flaming skull boss with a cheese burger how the hell you guna top that? 7. exploding cat grenade launcher shooting down a pyramid..... ok consider yourself topped. 8.Even though this is a rogue like (die and restart from the begining) you can keep gold and use it to level up your character or buy pets and guns to start with (disclaimer you can only start with 1 aditional gun eg, instead of shotgun you start with dark bow. 9. you get cute little pets that aid you in your quest. Whether that is gathering loot, shooting projectiles, taking hits or just killing enemies for you.  10. Its easy to just pick up and play I'm not saying you need no skill to play this but you can play this with no skill you just wont get far, how ever the learning curve is pretty gentle except the moon boss, god damn worm mofo recked my ♥♥♥♥ a ton of times.  and now story time.  Woke up in a forrest in some kinda pod, break out of pod and look around. Suddenly hear zoimbies turn around and there is a damned army of them pull out my gun and start mowing them down (pro zombie hunter screw you jill valentine) ammo boxes galore falling out of them but realise my pistol doent seem to need ammo, find red square on the floor touch it and it vanishes. Now pistol fires one bullet that becomes two! twice the zombie killing power! holy crap I have a shotgun when did this happen. Murder everything for the next 10 mins suddenly the forrest goes quiet but the silence is broke by a booming zombie voice. 'ARE YOU READY TO GET FUNKY' it yells. Suddenly starts to get dark, hmm didnt think it was that late I am puzzeld looks up to see the sun but there is no sun there is only size 155 boots bearing down on me. I run like hell switch to my GL and start shooting think to my self 'hows this gun guna kill me if he cant get close?' kite fight ftw when suddenly he shoopdawoops my ♥♥♥ back to the stone age with a beam of pure green energy.  17/10 would get murdered by zombie bose ~ IGN",

There are a lot of characters in the game, each spawn off with a different type of weapon (which can be bought inside a match anyways, the character just saves you the money from having to purchase the weapon in-game) and have their own default stats. You can use earned money in the game to add permanent stats to a character. I just saved up for one of the most expensive ones (which just took a couple of games) and I just added permanent stats to him. It's beyond pointless to buy more than one character. This game is getting very little attention from the DEV's, considering this is a very new game, that isn't a good thing.",
