            "review_text": "This is a temporary review. Many pros and cons can change after a couple of patches.    So the first thing everyone will say: It's like Banished  While that statement isn't that far off I find Villagers' freegame mode to be a completely different type of challenge. Everything is kept small, beginning with the numbers of villagers to the limited recources and jobs. This results the challenge to be micromanagement and carefully placing new buildings. More often than not I found myself starting a new map and my people quickly starved to death or got sick. Every single guy seems to make a difference and I'm always in need for more after I managed to get my food supply working.  You might say that some aspects I see going for the game are bad. Everyone has his tastes, so here are my Pros and Cons.  Pros:  -Slow but steady growth.  I am thankful for every new worker  -Requires attention.  As I said micromanagement is important. You might miss a tiny detail on why whatever you are working on makes no progress.  -No grid based maps.  Min/max players might find this one debatable, but I like putting down buildings around a village center in circles.  -A rather colorful style.  Having a friend who says Banished is too depressing, this is a welcome change.  -Tutorial in form of a storymode Yes, a tutorial is important to me. While it doesn't prepare you too well for the freegame mode, it really helps exploring possibilities.  And most importantly: The devs are very active and listen to the players.  There will be at least weekly patches. Expect many bug fixes and new content. Heck, they still improve Ghost Control Inc. which came out years ago.   More Pros may follow.    Cons: -Bugs and slowdowns.  A great annoyance, indeed. But really I haven't seen a bugfree release in a while when it comes to smaller studios.   -Tiny gameplay annoyances. Putting down fields for the farm can be a bit of a pain if you want them in a very speciffic place If you want to place any building in a free space you can't do it if a villager stands there   -Questionable AI priorities. Sometimes I get the feeling my villagers do anything BUT the job they are assigned to. Fulfilling personal needs like going to church etc more often than not. They don't even go get medicine despite being sick; their only reason for being unhappy  -Speaking of not doing their job: I have encountered which I believe is a bug where woodsmen and herbalists won't do anything. Leading to wood shortage or when a disease breaks out there's not enough medicine to heal everyone. Villagers burn through 32 medicine (max for one herbalist hut) quickly and until the the next outbreak I don't have nearly enough despite resources being available.  -'disasters' aren't much of a threat. Except diseases(reasons given above), bandits, wild animals, storms and lifestock infestations don't have much on an impact.   -Maps will always stay the same size, no random map creator. This one might be the most important con to some. Personally I haven't reached the point where I either wished for a bigger map or seek the challenge of random maps    Cons might be added or deleted in the future.    I cannot find a lot to dislike which is not patchable. The devs will look into it, no doubt. If you are looking for a game which has not too much depth to it while keeping your attention, check it out once it's a little cheaper or on sale",

            "review_text": "I didn't think it was fair that this game got mixed reviews. Therefore, I decided to write my own first review because I almost didn't buy it because of the mixed reviews. I am totally enjoying the game. In my oppinion it is not like bannished. Perhaps if you play it in sandbox mode. I am playing the campaign. The storyline is wonderful to me and easy to follow. Granted, it does get a little wordy at times and you have to read several screens. However, that's what makes it a story.   I did find one minor bug. My quest would not register that I completed them. I believe this was due to the fact that I was pausing the game ALOT during the storyline and all. Once I stoped doing that I didn't have a problem. So, you might want to watch how much you pause the game.  I think if your looking for a fun and reasonably challenging game this is for you. I really am having a good time with it.",

I am playing through a story right now and I am enjoying it. The story isn't Banished this is a game in its own right. I am liking the steady pace. The graphics are functional, not outstanding. They don't need to be. he sound is acceptable, no complaints. I am enjoying the journey. Decent value. This village has marked itself on my map, so I'm giving it a thumbs up.",

            "review_text": "If you are really bored and looking for Medieval Builder then you are probably going to buy this anyways.   I really can not recommend the game unless you have low expectations. It has a really low replay value.   The story to the game pretty much follows tutorial missions. The story was somewhat interesting yet definitely one of those stories you probably do not want to hear again.  There is a lot of comparison between Villagers and Banished. The similarities are both there and not there. Seeming how they are both medeival builders there is always going to be similarities. Meanwhile most those spouting the similarities avoid the simple answer. Which would you rather play Banished or Villagers? Since I own both I would pick Banished even without mods.   So why the thumbs dumb?  1. Maps. The game does NOT have a random map generator. I mean seriously, that is the majority of the replay value of any sandbox builder game. There is no map editor either.  2. Production balance. After playing a while the production values of various buildings seem very wonky and unbalanced.  - Barn had animals that pretty much died of old age before producing enough offspring to keep the barn producing. - Other production issues resolved.  3. Combat. They tried putting some form of combat into the game. Wild animal attacks and raiders. Honestly never should have bothered. Neither raiders or wild animals actually killed any villagers so kinda not seeing the point in investing in guards. It looks like the raiders basically ran in stole some stuff and ran off with it.  4. No refilling jobs. Anyone who played Banished knows this one. If a villager dies their job should be automatically filled from the pool of available laborers. Not having that feature in this game made it annoying once your settlers start dying off and you miss filling their job.  5. Bugs. Quite a few have been fixed however still a couple big ones that can ruin a game through population aging and starvation.  The game is getting better, there has been work on it since release. It just aint quite there yet I would recommend people to buy it. However if I knew someone that bought it, I would not make fun of them for owning a crappy game. So almost a thumbs up.",

            "review_text": "This game looks like it has potential, but I found it to be very buggy in ways that spoiled the game play.  Problems I had include quests in the campaign mode that cannot be finished (especially timed quests; it will sometimes say 'day 17 of 10' or whatever and never finish), each time that happened I had to revert to an earlier save and try again. Even more annoyingly, at one point my entire village simultaneously died 'of natural causes', the seasons sped up to a blur of constantly changing, but despite the fact that everyone was dead according to the population screen, there were still people wandering around the village. Zombies, presumably. Also, I couldn't figure out why my farmers would only grow vegetables despite having a grain field as well, they never touched it. I even built a second farm house, but they all just wanted vegetables.",

The ESC menu is overlaping with the game so if you accidently press ESC while you in a building management window you might close the game or restart a level.
