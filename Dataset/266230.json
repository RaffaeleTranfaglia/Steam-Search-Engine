            "review_text": "As seen in the forum, my impressions after a few hours:   Its quite free-roaming, and wandering around and getting into trouble in a couple places has been nice.  The skill system works quite nicely. Battles give you Skill Points that you can use to purchase skills for each class. Some are active and some are passive. Actives become abilities/spells that cost mana. You also need to meet level and skill prerequisites to get the more advanced skills. There also seems to be quite a lot of them.  The stat system has really grabbed my attention. It really seems to open a lot of potential for playing parties in different ways. You can focus on damage, magic, defense, health, mana pool etc. I've so far focused on getting my party faster than all the monsters so they go first in combat (with reasonable success) while making them all beefy. Its a simple yet elegant little system.  Classes are varied and fun, with unique properties that make them viable/worth consideration. Hunters can tame you Chocobos (moas) that you can ride around, Thieves let you steal from towns without worrying about guards, engineers let you take shortcuts etc.  The puzzles scattered around the world are also nice. They're just complicated enough to make you try more than once, but I have yet to get frustrated by one or take what I would consider too much time. They are also so far all different, which is nice because it doesn't feel like a harder version of the same puzzle every time.  The game also lets you customize difficulty with what must be at least 7 difficulty settings, as well as choosing when/how you allow yoruself to save. The New Game + modes include options to achievement hunt with a powered up party or just keep your gear and start a new party, or wipe all achievements to start again.  Graphics are the standard RPG Maker sprites and tiles. While this is not the most amazing game to look at, visuals are really not the point of this game and the gameplay is great. If you're a bit of a 'graphics ♥♥♥♥♥' you might not want to pick this one up.  Overall, very fun game so far, and it does indeed remind me of the older final fantasy games in terms of gameplay. ",

            "review_text": "Holy crap, I did not expect such an amazing game! I haven't had this much fun with an rpg since I was a kid. I've never played an rpg maker game before and had reservations about trying a game that looked very cheap and generic to be honest but I'm really glad I did. What the game lacks in original art it more than makes up for in game play and sheer scope. It does what old snes rpgs did so well then improves on them in subtle ways like letting players choose what skills to pick and the option to distribute character stats. This features are so well implemented that it makes you wonder how come it's so rare to see them in jrpg games.  The story is a little weak, you play a silent protagonist and your party members are completely anonymous henchman that get mentioned I think once in the entire game. There's a sort of trade off; instead of a tight narrative that restricts where and what your character can do like a more tradtional final fantasy story does, by not focusing on your character at first it allows for a very open world and gives the player a tremondous amount of freedom for exploration, especially once they get off the first continent. But the story does tighten up, you do get pulled into it more and more the further you get and I was pleasantly surprised by how good the ending was and by how varied it is depending on how you played through the game.  I don't like puzzles much, but they're all %100 optional which is a really nice and I found myself going out of my way to finish them all because they were so much fun. I've done almost every puzzle in the game (over 50!) and only a handful had me quit out of frustration or had me running to the strategy guide.  There's an amazing developer made guide for free, a giant 700 page pdf, and for a game this massive and complex it's a very welcome addition especially if you're new to this genre because this game pulls no punches when it comes to dificulty. Hard mode is extremely dificult, I consider myself a veteran of snes rpgs and this game had no qualms about kicking my ♥♥♥ and forcing me to reconsider my gear and what skills I should use for each character.  I can't recommend this game enough, can't wait for a sequel.",

            "review_text": "If you liked the first Final Fantasy and you are looking for more games with similar mechanics, you will love Last Dream, as I do. There are a few tweaks and improvements but do not expect anything new on the gameplay side. It's an ode to FF1 gameplay, with some inspiration and references to FF2 (US numbering). If their goal making this game was to do the perfect FF1 clone, in my opinion they achieved it!  I really like how the game lets you customize your party like FF1 (with more class choices) but at the same time delivers a strong story like the following FF. I took my time playing this game (on hard, save anywhere) and spent at least 100 hours on it, so I would say it's totally worth the full price. I didn't even complete all side quests, and could try a harder difficulty with different classes, plenty of unlocked achievements, etc. My point is there's plenty of content and some replay value.  Cons: - Controller support could have been better. Cannot use cross (must use thumb stick), customize options doesn't make sense and when you figure it out it doesn't allow you to choose from all the buttons you would want. So basically you better just learn to use the default mapping, it works though it's a bit unusual (confirm with X, switch characters with start and select instead of triggers...) - This kind of game is repetitive by nature, and fights can often be either too difficult or too easy. I just want to mention it, it's not really a con because that's what this game is supposed to be.  Pros: - Customization of start party and levelups - Customization of difficulty and save settings, for more/less old-school challenge. - Classic turn based combat - Awesome music (classic composers remixed on electric guitar: checked!) - Great story, original and different although inspired by FF. - A lot of content: side quests, crafting, fishing, arena, etc.",

            "review_text": "This is possibly one of the most fun and involved RPG's I have played in the last 10 years. IT IS GRIND HEAVY. However, the sheer amount of content that is within the game as well as the multitude of class options available to you make this game addicting.  I began with a black mage, monk, engineer, and thief  Here is my reasoning.  Monk  I feel the monk is a vital character late game. He kind of sucks on the outset, but upon building him with the ability to perform multiple attacks per turn at late game while buffed he is able to dish out tens of thousands of damage. (I had him buffed doing 25-35k around level 50-60). So he becomes vital as the sole damage at some points so the rest of you part can buff/heal.  Black Mage  I love AOE (area of effect). So while he monk can deal tons of single target damage bosses, the black mage mops up random battles with a single cast of a spell. Furthermore, the monk/ black mage combo is an absolutely vital choice. This is doubly true if you want to tackle all the optional bosses in the game, because the black mage has spells that seriously buff the monk's damage. So the monk falls off a bit if you don’t have the BM to back him up.  Engineer  I have a love/hate relationship with this character. Believe it or not I took him in place of a dedicated healing class, which was a source of frustration for 75% of the game. I will argue that he is an AMAZING HEALER, but you MUST invest time into fishing in order for him to be good. This is not optional. So if you don’t want to be forced into a butt load of fishing don’t take him as a healer (fish are the best source by far of healing in the game). That being said, what makes him so good is that he gets a skill that doubles and then later triples the effectiveness of the items he uses. Sadly, he is the worst class by far for early and mid-game and often just becomes a source of a few minor buffs and an item user.  Thief  Stealing is love, stealing is life, steal. He's mediocre but you need him to steal the best items in the game of the optional bosses. Did I mention he steals?  Music 7/10  The music is good though I feel that the developers tried too hard to make every battle sound epic. This often leads to points in the game where the music becomes abrasive to the ears when you hopping in and out of battles every minute or so. I actually had to shut the music off at some points because all I would hear is maybe the first 20 seconds of the song when it’s at its most explosive volume. This also translates to the map where it does not pause the music, but instead chooses to start from the beginning every time you come out of battle. However, the boss music is phenomenal. The only reason this doesn’t get an eight out of ten is the technical oversights in its execution. The rest of the game is littered with classical covers (which I love) and a steady stream of acoustic guitar and metal.  Gameplay 8/10  No complaints here. Just your standard RPG elements.  Story 7/10  I don’t know why I am supposed to care about the main character. In fact he or she is kind of an enigma through most of it. Other than that it’s just your standard crazy bad guy with delusions of grandeur.  Exploration 10/10  This is a place where this game REALLY shines! The world feels HUGE and only continues to grow when you access the submarine and can explore underwater. The areas in the game themselves can often time be complicated requiring you to backtrack with multiple branching paths to make sure you found everything. I am a completeionist so the amount of area to explore really added to the fun of this game to me.  Side quests 10/10  This is possibly the best part of the game as I am one who absolutely loves side quests! For as much as there is to explore, there’s even more side quests to do along the way. For starters in every dungeon in the game, there is an average of 1-3 puzzles you can complete. While they are not necessary (but they are, lets be serious who wouldn’t want to do them?) they can give you exceptional loot assuming you're not over leveled when you complete them (that happened to me a few times). Now they may be as simple as pushing a few blocks such as the first puzzle in Oakwood sewers to the horrific and arduous hour plus trial in the great southern marsh. (Screw you developer who came up with that).  Now these puzzles are but one of the many side quests in this game. Next is my favorite. Bounty hunting! That’s right folks early in the game you are tasked with exterminating baddies across the world map. Now you start by killing some lowly trash, (don’t be fooled though the first time I fought the goblin king I got wrecked) but end up working your way to fight creatures of myth. Once again these are all optional and I recommend that you have a thief in your party because some of them hold the best items in the game.  Next is the abyss which as of writing this I have only tentatively tried out. This thing is brutal and that is taking it lightly. The game starts you at level one with no gear and it’s up to you to relevel inside and make it all the way to the bottom. The catch is you have to pretty much do it all in one rip. In fact due to my party setup (engineer/black mage/thief/monk) I may have to replay the game with a different party because the engineer is not a viable healer in there. Which attests to the difficulty of the game if you are not properly prepared.   I don’t want to list all of them here, but besides these there are many more points of interest in the world that you can reap many benefits from finding and doing. Half the fun is finding them right?  Difficulty 10/10 (assuming you don’t over level)  Party: monk/black mage/thief/engineer  I want to say that I started out on hard. This is considered by the game guide to be the standard difficulty the developers wanted and it wasn’t a joke. Maybe it was my party set up, or maybe it is the game itself, but damn this game was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at points. I started out as a black mage and they didn’t even give me a single damn spell to work with! (Was fire 1 too much to ask?) So early on if you lack many physical options in your party it will be much harder. I finished the main game at 70 that was after doing every optional boss I could find. To top that off I had some of the most broken equipment (Amaranthine Ring/ kali's ring/ rainbow gear) in the game! And still the final boss could one shot some of my characters fully buffed. However, fishing is an MVP in this game that really helps 'tackle' (get it....) some problems.  It seems that almost every damn enemy has a status afflicter so at any given time you’re either blowing MP or items almost every fight in an attempt to keep your party in top shape. This is both a blessing and a curse for me because I have always felt that status attacks were a really underdeveloped aspect of most rpgs and used as a gimmick to make certain encounters harder. Last Dream on the other hand makes status a constant worry for you and your party especially if you enabled the 'no saves in dungeons' option. This means that you must careful allocate what resources you want to use and when because you may just end up being totally unprepared and have to backtrack to resupply. However they were not entirely jerks when they did this and if you so choose to forego healing an ally many of these status ailments will wear off over several turns. (I usually found it to be 4-5 for most)    So you may be asking: 'is this game for me?' I do indeed hope so. I also hope that my review gave you the push you needed to get it. There are a million more things I could touch base on concerning this title but I feel like I have taken enough of your time. In summation I have never seen more love put into a game than this title, and I feel that the industry itself would benefit for more developers with this amount of passion for their projects.",

In terms of design philosophy I would have to compare it to something like Dark Souls or God Hand in the way it effortlessly conveys complex game mechanics to new players without 'hand-holding' as well as featuring gameplay both equally challenging and rewarding.  A genuine throwback to some of the finest hits of the golden era of 16-bit RPG classics like Chrono Trigger or Final Fantasy 6, dare I say even better. Anyone who grew up during the height of the 16-bit RPG owes it to themselves to add this gem to their collection and for those who did not get to experience it firsthand this is a great oppurtunity to relive the magic.

There are loads of side-quests, collectibles, and other completion things that will keep you exploring the massive world for hours on end.  The world is great. The soundtrack ranges from fast and heavy to ethereal and serene and even includes a few classical pieces. The environments are charming. One of my favorite parts of the towns is the books on people's shelves and tables. They're actual books written by actual people. I love the attention to detail and the surprises you find in exploring the world.  Beyond just the game itself, the developers are very helpful and responsive to player feedback. They have produced a gargantuan strategy guide (available on their website) that can help you with whatever you need. There is also an expansion that is nearing completion as of now (October 2015) and a sequel on the horizon.  If you're going to have one turn-based RPG in your library, this is the one to have!",

There's tons of secrets and achievements in the game, and you can customize your party's stat gains and skill advancement completely. It sounds cumbersome, but it's rather simple - you can even just set them along preset paths if you wish. It's well worth your money, and the developers are hard at work fixing any bugs that pop up.

            "review_text": "First impressions:  Last Dream plays very similarly to Final Fantasy (the first one), but is re-imagined for a more modern day. Just like FF1, you have a selection of classes to build your party from (although you get 8 instead of 6). All the old classes are here; the warrior, monk, thief, black mage, white mage, and grey mage (the analog to red mage). As a side note, even the old Dia spell is here; the white mage spell whose sole purpose is to deal tons of damage, but only to undead. The two newcomers are the engineer, who lets you take shortcuts via tunneling and specializes in consumable items in combat, and the hunter, who lets you scan enemies, revealing their stats and granting a damage boost against them. Of course, just like FF1, you only get to pick four. Picking my four from those eight proved to be one of the most difficult choices I've made in my gaming life. I won't tell you what I picked; I'd rather not influence your choice.  The game itself seems to have a strong emphasis on building your party the way you want. No part of character growth is automated; you get to control it all. Your characters learn skills by accumulating skill points in the same way you gain xp, then spending them on the skills you want. Even when your characters level up, nothing happens immediately; rather, your character gains a pile of stat points which you can allocate as you choose. As a result, combat is less about the exact skills you use in combat and more about how your built your characters. This can potentially be a very bad thing; if you suddenly reach a boss who consistantly wrecks your face, it may be a sign that you built wrong. On the flip side, it can reduce the grinding you need to do to get past a problem boss. If it deals exclulsively physical damage, just level up once and dump all your points into physical defense.",

(it's a ~15 min cutscene).   - gameplay/combat: overall good, though some things are a bit unbalanced (thief's throwing stars, I'm looking at you). once you get the powerful abilities it gets a bit repetitive, since you just spam them and one-hit almost every non-boss. but I have to admit I was a bit overleveled by the endgame. other than that, bosses are (usually) a real challenge.  - gameplay/character progression: fantastic, you build them the way you want. LOTS of options, and not just 'flavour' ones, every decission matters.  - level design: overall good. I didn't noticed anything annoying regarding it, so, that's a good signal. on the other hand, I'm not sure I liked the 'flavoured' dungeons, e.g. the dread woods (was that one?), where it seems to be a perpetual storm. sure, it added immersion, but it was kinda difficult to see where you were going....   - puzzles: some of them are actually intelligent ones, but some of them are just a matter of skill (eg. run following a pattern). overall good. also, you can skip them if you want.  - graphics: they fit the game. but obviously, if you are looking for fancy 3D graphics (like skyrim's), then looks elsewhere. this game is not about graphics.   - bottom thoughts: maybe I haven't played anough JRPGs to make a better comparison, but it kinda reminded me of pokemon. It has that kind of replayability, sadly, my backlog is too huge to starti it again now. It will have to wait a bit. also, be sure to take a look at the manual/guide. I'm not saying you need to follow the walkthrough, but in some points, it's well worth it to take a look at where you are supposed to go next. else you could keep wandering around for some time.... or finish a dungeon before you were supposed to start it. (say, I got to the end of the marsh before getting the crystals... and the medallion wasn't there, lol. it was a difficult dungeon, so I ended up overleveled. but it was FUN to take such a high-level dungeon a few levels under the recommendation. maybe I need to try a higher difficulty on my next playthrough)",

            "review_text": "I'll start by saving you and me the time of repeating the points listed in the Developers Trailer... They are all ones I would list as 'Pro'. While the few I enjoyed the most being the custom Leveling and Party Building.  Put simply, this may be an RPG Maker game, more than enough effort was put into customizing the experience so that it hardly feels like one, and more like an old skool JRPG.   I'll also note that I have not experienced the Arena, Abyss, or the Hunters Guild... But if I understand them, I doubt I would appreciate them if I did. They strike me as cookie cutter grinds, and there is already plenty of that in the default travel mechanics as most point of interest are extremely far from each other.  lastly, I'll mention that I am still intent on playing the game, so the 11 hrs (as of this review) is just a start, though I think PLENTY of time to form an opinion.  Here are my criticisms. (In order of irritation)  #1: Lack of quest log. With all the custom scripting put into this title I am dumfounded as to WHY even a simple quest log wasn't one of them. As a result it is WAY TO EASY to get side tracked and no remember what the hell the point was of being wherever you are. ESPECIALLY after taking a few days off from playing it, or playing other games in the interim.  #2: Skill Purchasing. There is NO WAY to know why you should choose one skill before another, due to a complete lack of cost, restriction, and condition information for almost ALL level up purchasable skills. A one line blurb simply isn't enough. Its implementation is an illusory depth that would serve equally if it were an auto gain on level up, like 99% of JRPG's.   #3: Specialty Classes. There is simply NO reasonable excuse for the way the specialty classes, (e.g. engineer) are implemented. One is forced to choose this specialty before the game even begins, and is LOCKED into it without full context as to how each ones 'specialty' (*cough* weakness) is made up for by choosing it.   I mention the engineer specifically due to the LOUGHABLE specialty to side step travel via tunnels... Which IRONICALLY serves more to remove needed leveling (grinding) than anything, as the time saved using the tunnels will have to be made up for in between by fighting more battles to make up for using the tunnels in the first place. AND you've stuck fighting those 'make up' battles with a weak alternative to another class, or whatever...   You're BETTER OFF totally ignoring the specialty classes. (or so it seems)  There are few more but they are minor.   Over all, the positives outweighed the negatives, and I would recommend this game. ",

Quest journal would be nice, but on the other hand, the story is quite linear, so I guess journal won´t make any difference anyhow.......

My only complaint would be the grind, i just got off the 1st continent and im level 15, you stop learning new abilities at level 20. now im assuming theres either not a level cap and you keep going without adding more skills but if that were the case i would still like to see some skills post level 20 added even if its just a few 'ultimate' skills that have a very large SP cost to learn. But i digress the game is very retro, the game is exceptionally fun and the story is kind of plain but there are dozens of side quests and places to explore making up for any short comings in the main story. overall 4/5 from me, highly recommended and cheap retro style rpg with a couple hundred achieves, well worth the price.",

Odd that within the intro you show up outside of town with NO equipment whatsoever, but during the initial cut scene it speak of your party as being awesome warriors who've gained so much experience. LOL I walked into the forest and got my ♥♥♥ handed to me. Didn't realize you need to go back into the town you just walked out of and buy some stuff :) Mind it was about 1am when I was playing, not my finest work, overall LOADS of fun I enjoyed the heck out of it and will continue playing it.",

I actually completed it, which is rare for me and JRPG's nowadays, and I had fun doing it.",

            "review_text": "Many appear to be saying that this is one of the best JRPG games that they've ever played. Despite only playing for about an hour, the initial impression that it leaves on me isn't a good one.  From an RPG game, I expect a likable and exciting story line that captivates me and just makes me sit on the edge of my seat in anticipation as to what's going on next. This is because most well-written stories have the player empathize with the characters on screen, and make the player feel motivated to reach that end goal. This game, not so much. You have no clue what's going on, and it never really explains. There's no apparent end goal from what I can see, and the only goal thrown to you at the start is one you could care less about: saving a person's daughter who you have no connection with or have never met.  Next up: controls. They suck. I've heard some stuff that the mapping for controls on an XBOX Controller is terrible and awkward, but I'm focusing on the keyboard, as that's what I've used. It's uncomfortable and awkward. It's strictly keyboard usage, which means you can't use the mouse at all, so navigating through menus in a pain to me, because I'm more used to using the mouse. Perhaps I'm just being picky, but the controls for the keyboard aren't the best, and it took me about thirty minutes just to figure out how to select and name my characters.  The last thing I'm going to touch is how difficult this game is. Now, a challenge in any game is good, and defeating that challenge makes it even more rewarding in the end because you feel as if you actually conquered something. In this game, it's cheap. All monsters do so much damage, while you can only do anywhere from 1 - 10 damage to them, depending on the class type. And you don't get any special abilites or skills to start with, either. That means every class you picked is basically just a stronger or weaker character that only has one attack. So, it makes it hard to get anywhere in this game, because in the beginning, you're getting your butt handed to you by a low level slime. This is why I have only played an hour on this game, because I can't get over this hill which prevents me from completing a battle and earning XP.  This game was a real disappointment to me. I'm sorry that I haven't played more of it to get a bit of a feel for the game, but as I've said, the initial hill to pass to actually beat monsters effectively is too steep to climb. That's why I can't recommend this game to anyone, and those who believe this game is actually worth $10, I'm afraid you're wrong in my eyes. It could have been done much better, but this was made in a $70 program that you can get on Steam, so I doubt much coding was really needed.  Thank you for reading my review.",

It would seem to me that you have to grind, grind, grind to make your way through. Something I really don't want to do. I'm putting this one away for a while.  Edit: One other thing that is really bothersome is MP comsumption and regeneration. Black and white mages are pretty much useless without mp. The cost of spells is rediculous and there's no way to get mp back other than an inn or using fish. Even fish are awful though. The beginning fish give 1, yes, ONE mp back per fish (or the other fish that gives 1 mp for the party).  At this point I think I might just remake my party...",

(the 4 grey mage save which does no harm)  It could have been avoided if the Devs were more competent, 'test' prior to the hotfixes. Difficult to justify spending time on indie title when you don't know when someone would just mess up your progress.  Last Deam itself is quite a nice game for oldschool RPG player, if you ever buy it when it goes on sale, I heavily recommand avoid using the first 2 slot of saves and make multiple saves of your main party. Maybe turn off cloud sync for his title so your local files will not get replaced.  People have limited time to play games when you grow up and it really hurts when you end up with a title that backfires. It is a real shame when the market is flooded with RPG maker titles and I paid for a unpleasant experience.  TL;DR Do not use 1st and 2nd save slot and disable cloud sync if you ever play the game.",
