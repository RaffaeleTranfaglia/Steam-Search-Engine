            "review_text": "After putting over 100 hours on UT3, I still like UT2K4 more, but I do feel it has one thing going for it. That's the Vehicle Capture-The-Flag gamemode.   It is the perfect combination of teamwork and individual skill. There needs to be someone who can snatch the enemies flag and move it effectively while being gimped (Flag carriers cannot use vehicles). The rest of the team needs to simultaneously support the carrier as well as protect their own flag.  All of this is made more complex by a diverse array of vehicles and this is further complicated by the fact that one team may not have the same vehicles available to them as the opposition. And somehow the game maintains balance! It is an incredible feat of game and map design.  This game has other merits worth mentioning. It's still gorgeous after all this time. Soundtrack lives up to the brand. The Godlike AI is still intelligent as hell (aggravatingly so on vanillla CTF).  Definitely worth your money and the time your minced bits will layer the walls like a grisly fresco.",

            "review_text": "This game is one of the best multiplayer shooters ever made (besides UT2004 of course).   UT3 is very fast paced compared to other first person shooters. Players have the ability to dodge and wall dodge in order to move even more faster &amp; to avoid being hit by enemies. Players don't have to worry about reloading their weapon either. Some servers may require you to pick up more ammo or weapons &amp; some just have an unlimited ammo supply, but there is no need for hitting a reload key like in other first person shooters.  Servers &amp; mods- Different servers have a variety of mods and maps. If mods aren't your thing you can join one of the official servers and play there instead. I personally love the mods though since it makes the experience more worthwhile with better weapons &amp; being able to level up weapon damage and health.   Game type- I appreciate Greed which makes UT3 different from other Unreal games in a way. It may be said that Greed is similar to Bombing Run due to the 'hoop' that one has to go through in order to score but they obviously aren't the exact same. In Greed, there are two teams (red and blue), the objective is to capture as many skulls as possible by killing enemies and score them at the enemy base.   Even though not many people play anymore this will still be one of my favorites and I will keep going back to it just for fun. I really can't stop playing because it brings back good memories with my old clan members and the game nights we use to have every few weekends. Some of the best people I ever met were from UT!   (My time in game on here isn't even close to how much time I've actually played since I used the CD version for years before the steam version.) I've been playing the Unreal series since 2004.",

It won't change much anyway.  - no vehicles and hoverboards, that supposed to be better? Lol. They could just add an option to turn them off; - weapon design is worse (just look at the ♥♥♥♥ing sniper rifle, who designed this ♥♥♥♥?); - weapons don's shake while you fire them (hello Quake Live); - player models are MUCH worse (the only better part is the face) with thin and small arms and hands; - voice acting - ♥♥♥♥ing terrible (ok, you can say pre-alpha placeholders); - perfomance is much worse with almost the same graphics; - less game modes;  Literally the only good thing about UT4 is the UT99 Facing Worlds map remake.

Graphics are great but for the most part distant objects are blured. There is no story here.  Competitvness:  - Noone is playing this game anymore so no online multiplayer with real opponents,  - Weapons and the overall killing schema is mostly based on luck for an average UT3 player,  - If you somehow do manage to find populated server youll be wrecked and by wrecked i mean GET DA fffffff-c-k OUTA HERE NO KILLS FOR YOU!  Conclusion: If you wanna play this download it from t-o-r-e-n-t-z youll get the exact same game. FOR FREE! This game is not worth the purchase after GameSpy services went down.  Side note for me: EPIC can provide Kick-♥♥♥ engine but crapy unsuported games. (DO not ever buy games produced by EPIC again)",

            "review_text": "Of all of the UT games made after 99, this might be the least bad.  The gameplay is sub par, but it is a lot easier to get 10 people to download UT 3 off steam than it is to hand out UT99 CDs. Actually that's not true; we had a bunch of authentication problems playing UT 3 on a LAN even though we all purchased it.  The game DOES have a sniper rifle, and does NOT have that stupid ♥♥♥ lightning gun, so that's a huge plus.  The rocket launcher's alternate fire only fires 3 rockets. The only weapon with a lamer alt fire is the bio rifle.  There are some classic maps which cool improvements, like Deck 17 and Facing Worlds.  The single player campain is incredibly annoying. Plotwise, they try to sort of invent this unecessary, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ story backwards from deathmatch to explain people dying and respawning all the time. It seems complately unrelated to the 'plot' of UT99. The worst, though, is that you can't choose to play only deathmatch levels and/or completely ignore certain game modes.  For multiplayer, they also try to force you onto some lame social media thing (which does not connect to steam) in order to play with other people. I wish I had known that before buying. At the last lan party I attended, no one was able to connect this way, so we all opted to play in disconnected/offline mode or whatever they call it. Unfortunately when you do that, there is no UI for changing your name; you have to open the console and type something every single time you join. Also, so far, I haven't found a way to save your single player progress in offline mode.  A lot of very simple configurations and settings that I took for granted have been removed. For example: you can't do random map rotations. UT 99 had a simple checkbox that let you enable map rotation to avoid playing the same order every time, or disable for people who hate fun. It does seem like they've opted to have 'mutators' take the place of simple configuration options, and I don't have a strong opinion on that, but they didn't include a mutator to put the random map feature back.  The bot skill levels are a little wacky. 'Skilled' level bots spend a lot of time standing in one place waiting to be shot. That seems like something that maybe only the first bot level should do.  There is some new war mode thing with spheres. Its kind of cool, although the vehicles are pretty lame. Especially the hover board. And Assault is gone.",
