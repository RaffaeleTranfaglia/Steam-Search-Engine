            "review_text": "The good:  Soundtrack Physics  The Bad: Lack of levels Takes 30 minutes or less to complete whole game Not much special features going on   Overall, this game I somehow still enjoyed, I liked the music and the smooth movement. The art was paper style and was simple. So graphics were fine. However, I think it isn't worth 3 dollars. I say this game should be a mobile/free online game. It's worth about free or a dollar. It's still somehow fun to play for a little while... So I say it's your go on whether you should buy it or not. I personally think it's okay.",

        {
            "review_text": "The game is pretty fun, but there are some pretty bad bugs in multiplayer (Like not being able to beat a level if there is only 1 player left - that might not be a bug, but it should restart the level if that's the case. And on the moon level, the rover goes underground, pops up about 20 feet forward, then explodes.). Also, the game does seem to be a bit short. For the price I would say it's worth it, but watch out for a few bugs.",

But it's a fun little game, works as expected. Its main appeal to me is the local co-op; I don't believe I'd ever play it solo.",
