            "review_text": "I recommend this game for every Shmup fan on steam because it's free.  BUT :   This is a Danmaku made by a guy (Italian I think), and we can clearly see that he's a fan of Touhou. Everything looks like Touhou, the enemy Health bar, the first character, and the spellcards are pretty similar. That's not a bad point.  BUT (So many Buts, pun intended), it fails at creating a real atmosphere. You just have a background (like fog, space etc), and you're shooting enemies familiar to the elements (example : Aliens or Robots in space). Of course, the main goal on a game like this is to score a maximum of points, but it looks generic.  Gameplay is pretty much the same as Touhou or eXceed, you can graze (you have to if you wanna score anyway), you can bullet cancel with bomb, you also can cancel your death with bombs. You have a focus button to slow down and make your hitpoint visible.  The problem with the game, is the optimization. Sometimes it's full of colorful effects and the game runs at 60 fps. Sometimes, just because of the moving background, the game runs at 45/50 fps, creating a feeling of playing into the Matrix. Looks really weird.  Music-wise, it's good, not great. It's good because I heard some Dubmood in it, but like I said, it fails at delivering an atmosphere. Think of Touhou (very traditional music) or eXceed (more action = more agressive music). Jigoku offers good music, but that kinda feels off for this type of game. Musics don't fit that well to stages/bosses.   FINAL : It's free, so why not give it a try ? I still recommend it, but if you wanna play something more serious, go for Touhou, eXceed, Ikaruga or even Alltynex Second.",

            "review_text": "I like to play bullet hell game. And since this was free, why not give it a try?  Overall I would recommend it since it is free and it is pretty interesting to see how different spellcards of Touhou got combined together (Seriously, I was laughing non-stop through the game. The bosses' attacks are.... fun in a sense.). It has almost the same mechanics as Touhou so if you know the basics you're good to go.   I have only completed the first character upon this review (Tenshi, 1cc Normal first try) so it will be mostly based on this one experience.  The normal difficulty for first 2 stages are harder than most other bullet hell games. Mostly due to unexpected patterns when you think it is safe to go to auto-collection point.   And the more I play, the more it become a 'Try-to-guess-the-original' game. I was thinking of 'Ah, hi Satori, your lasers look good today. Oh? Suddenly Byakuren graced this occasion. How gracious. Mokou, please do not sudden leapt at me like that!'  That happened in just a spellcard for a boss.  The monsters pattern are also strikingly similar to QB shooting and exCeed (Touhou is already a given). Stage 3, it is almost the same as QB Shooting's 5th stage, barring rockets flying alongside you.   The music is almost the same for all stages (at least that was the impression I had while playing). It feels like the music is there for the sake of it, and does not fit the characters / their danmaku style. Not a single sound track has a lasting impression on me.  And Tenshi is just Reimu in disguise.  ====================================  Update after finishing Easy/Normal with all characters and losing Hard at last spell card :  There... isn't any story.Yes, you do know a little more about the characters, but there is no story to be seen. You could look at the bios for more backstory but...   The difficulty range, to be honest, is pretty narrow. For the stage battles, I do not feel much difference between easy and normal (except for more bullets) and between normal and hard (much more bullets but still easy enough to dodge). Spellcard battles on the other hand have nice difficulty increase.   The playable characters (excluding the hidden characters) have attacks all exactly the same as Touhou's characters. Youmu's short range attack, Marisa's laser, Aya's spread attack, Reimu's homing, Yukari's hold position. Personally I prefer to use homing / laser. The laser girl has movement speed that is ridiculously slow (which is actually good in spellcard battle) and limited range of attack (straight above her), but her damage output is way beyond what others can dish out (other than perhaps the hidden hidden character, or the hidden character if you placed your position correctly)  Even after repeated playthroughs, the music still does not leave much of an impression on me, except perhaps some of the different last stage bosses.   And I am not sure if I am glad that there is no lasers in this game, or am agonized that a straight chain of bullets are replacement for lasers. Either way, curving lasers are sin. (Wait, there are lasers.... and I hate Shou's (of Touhou) laser spellcards. Alien girl is my achillies heel.)  ================================================================",

The gameplay works fairly well and there is a decent amount of challenge even on normal, and the character designs are all pretty good. Additionally, there are 4 difficulty modes, different playable characters, and your performance is graded at the end of each stage, which adds replay value. That said, this game isn't great, its inspirations are obvious and it's inspirations are to the extent that Jigoku is too afraid to take risks and do its own thing. Danmaku Unlimited also has very similar if not the exact same mechanics as Touhou, but Danmaku Unlimited has its own unique theme and style in regards to presentation, which helps it stand out from the crowd. The same just can't be said for Jigoku, what with the somewhat generic chiptune soundtrack and 'indie retro' graphics.  But it's free and it's fun, so who cares right? Might as well just download it for yourself and see if you like it or not.",

These types of Japanese indie games are designed with controllers in mind, so hopefully you have one, but it is still possible to play it with a keyboard, you use won't have as much control over your character.  If you're just starting out with these types of shumps (aka danmaku,) start on Easy, because it's like a Roguelike/lite, it's going to be hell.  What I really like about all danmaku games is their portrayal of bullet 'art' and great music. Music in this game is no exception.",

I primarily had a problem with the first stage as there is no gradual decent into bullet hell, it’s just bullets flying out with no mercy right from the start, and also there is no grace time between waves, boss attacks, and spell cards to use the item collect area. Only notable GOOD things are that the portraits aren't as horrid as ZUN's artwork and that the sides of the playfield are dim so you can see if enemies are entering from the sides. ",

        {
            "review_text": "Let's start with the review. The game is a Danmaku style, most popularized in the west by Touhou, so the two games feel very much alike. They are not the same game, as each has its own differences. Jigoku Kisetsukan is slightly harder then most Tohuou games, resting at about Touhou 11's or 12's level of difficulty. Early on the game consists of a lot of what i call panic spells, attacks that look scary, until you sit back and notice the pattern, then they become rather easy. Later on, about stage 4, the game changes into actually difficult attacks that don't rely on panic spells to kill you.   My pros for the game are as follows.     Large cast of playable characters, 5 main and 1 unlockable     Interesting characters and designs that don't feel overly sexualized for the sake of 'because'    Boss Attacks that both look and feel unique    Interesting take on the spare life counter and interesting ways of collecting lives and bombs    Boss attacks are genuinly challenging and require skill to complete    Stage practice mode for all characters and difficulties    Character dialog. say you are playing as Tenshi and reach stage 4 and you fight Fumin, then you play as Fumin and reach stage 4 and fight tenshi, the dialog will be the same. Tenshi will say the same lines if you are playing as her, or as Fumin and same with the other Characters. A little thing, but one that I liked as it made the different characters all feel like they are in the same general time zone. Plus if you are playing as Nibiiro, you can see what she is thinking during her periods of silence from the other character's perspective.    Parts of the OST, stage 3, stage 4, stage 5 and several of the boss fight 5s come to mind when I think of the good songs in the game.    Depending on which character you pick, you will get a different final boss. All the final bosses share 3(I think) attacks, but the rest are unique to that boss    The bars on the side of the screen that house the HUD are slightly transperant so I can see where enemies are coming from, before they start firing so I can prepare to kill them off quickly.  I may add to this as I play the game more.  My cons for the game and reasons why are as follows    The HUD for it is a little... not good. The life, power, and bomb bar are cramed down in the bottom left, rather far away from where you focus on causing something like checking how many bombs you have can mean opening yourself to get killed. Plus the actual number amount of lives and bombs is a bit small, making it harder to see, and thus adding to the first reason.    The stage 5 attacks have a very sudden jump in difficulty, they feel a bit too hard all of the sudden. Though I suppose that will go away with time and practice.    Character's don't handle the best. this is more of a personal con, but everyone except Nibiiro moves around a bit too fast, where as Nibiiro moves a little too slowly. I did end up adapting to Nibiiro's slow speed and massive power and she is my current favorite, but the other cahracters all have the same move speed which is just a bit too fast for me to really play well.    Some of the shot types are rather unfair. Another personal Con, but Eiko, Mizuiro and Fumin all have weird shot types that just feel so akward, especially Eiko with her TD focused Youmu-esque short range blade cuts.    The chiptune OST at times, while there are some good songs in the game, some bad ones that give me a bit of a headache. Plus if you take too long killing the midboss and the stage song runs out, it doens't loop meaning you have no song playing until you reach the boss.    The location of the enemy names bothered me a bit, simmilar to my HUD con, they are kinda out of the way and you don't notice them much so I have been having trouble learning the names of the characters.    You don't get bombs back after death, making it so that if you run out of power due to constant death during a boss fight, you are screwed unless you are willing to use a continue.    During boss fights, loosing power to dying often is hard to come back from. Clearing a boss attack doesn't give enough power to make up for losing 1-3 points of power    The plot is... hoping to be there. The gist of Tenshi's story is understandable somewhat, if not a little bland. however the other character's stories are nearly non-exsistant. Not to mention The last unlockable character, ??? or    TenSHI    has no plot, and actually conflicts with something else in the game's story.    You play as tenSHI, who is Thanatos, the embodiment of the fear of death who stole the body of Tenshi, yet you fight Tenshi as the final boss. How can you play as TenSHI, yet fight tenshi?   . While it does feel like there is indeed different stories all going on at the same time with how each character fights Tenshi where you would fight them if you were playing Tenshi, it still feels like there is no plot to the game, and the little plot of Tenshi's story isn't well ended.    A continuation of the last one, what about Muzuiro? Her search for the Druid that helped her as a child was an interersting idea that I wish we could see more of. does she ever actually find the druid?   Those were the cons, and here are a few things that don't fit in either con, or pro, but that I want to mention, mostly to the dev.    Midbosses, like the stage 4 one I think. Negadev was it? I want to know more about it but there is nothing about it, same with the other midbosses like the pilots of Nibiiro's space ship, or Mizurio's dragon thing in her stage and bombs. Plus why did Nibiiro blow her own ship up and then cry about how it is gone now.    I feel like Eiko, at least as tenshi, wasn't explained well enough. I didn't really get that it was a curse giving her the ears until after I beat her, which at that point I was too busy getting into the game to realize it until I played through Tenshi's story again to 1CC it.    Nibiiro's ball things also confused me, what exactly are they? The eye things I mean. Playing as her, they act as her fammilars to fire her lasers, but I don't see them in her boss fight, or her ever think about them. I assume they are her weapons?    I would like it a lot of there were volume controls, like to make the sound effects louder, but not change the volume of the music. Also a Music library like the Touhou games has would be nice.    There is an issue with the achivements, not sure if this was intended, but I can unlock ???/  TenSHI    by unlocking Dev, then just going back and playing another character for a second time, instead of beating Dev's story. Plus I could get achievments by playing on easy and using continues. Lastly playing as ???/  TenSHI    lets you get the 'immortal' achievment by simply playing the character as you should. I think getting that achievment should be locked if playing as ???/  TenSHI      Lastly is my overall opinion of the game. Freaking awesome. I wish more fans of Danmaku would make games like this.    Reminder, 5/10 is average, 5/10 doesn't not mean it is bad, just that it is not good or bad    Music: 6/10 Attack patterns 8/10 Character: 9/10 Challenge level: 8/10 Story: 3/10 Overall Score: 7/10 I hope to see a sequel of some kind eventually. Whether it follows directly after this game, takes place before, later, or has an entierly new cast, I want to see more of this kind of work.",

The music motivated me through each level and boss with an amazing soundtrack that I would buy no matter the cost. After 3 days of playing, I soon realized it wasn't that hard, and I charged through. It captured me in its art style and gameplay with a story line that affects all the main characters. The bosses seemed a bit too challanging at times, but the are supposed to be. They're bosses, duh. But overall, I give this game 8.5/ 10 stars and would recommend it to anyone interested in free games or bullet hells.",

Pros: -Amazing, original soundtrack -Unique story -It's free, and has steam achievements -Very challenging  Cons: -Not for casual gamers, this game requires grinding. -Can become repetitive if you are hunting the achievements. If you want it only for achievements, I don't recommend it as it is extremely hard to get all the achievements.  This game surprised me, and it is one of my favourite games.
