If you're into the whole side-scrolling, rougey, procedural, pixely, dungeon crawlers then this is for you.  +Graphics and audio are top notch +Controls feel good and responsive (espeacially on xbox controller) +Enemies can get pretty damn hard +Fun weapons and stat modifyers +Wall jumping!  -Game is way too short. It didn't take me very long to beat it -Could use more variety of weapons and stat modifiers -Needs more enemies -WTF, there's no boss!!!  Nonetheless, it's a fun playthrough. I don't regret the $4.00 I spent on it (Steam Summer Sale 2014)",

            "review_text": "This game is pretty awesome. I enjoy these rogue-lite genre games, and this is a pretty decent one. The controls are (for the most part) rock solid and the gameplay is fantastic. The art style is enjoyable, and I LOVE the music. Two marks against it are inventory management, and a lack of rebindable movement keys. The invintory tends to clutter up with old useless tat that I can't seem to get rid of. All of the other keyboard keys CAN be rebound, but not the movement ones. I hate using the arrow keys, so I had to resort to autohotkey (binding of isaac method much?) to reconfigure my keys. Beisdes those two small issues, I find this game to be a keeper.",

            "review_text": "This game is very, very fun. It's like a Castlevania game with roguelike elements. I've only played a bit but I am currenty enjoying it. It is a difficult game, which I am personally a fan of, (though I know many others get frustarted easily and may be annoyed by the difficulty), and I feel a lot of the games fun comes from good gameplay and difficult levels. This is an early access game, so obviously many things will be added to the game in time. But there are a few things I would like to see added to the game. First, some bosses. While I found each level to be a challenge, I was dissapointed to see no big bosses. So I look forward to that hopefully being implemented. Also, some sort of stats for wepons in item descriptions would be nice. Maybe even add some new characters with different starting stats and weapons like dark souls? I look forward to each new update and seeing what's added to this awesome game!",

After changing the default controls and getting used to play, it was a comparable experience to the best of it's category. I enjoy the control sensitivity, easy and ability to save mid-dungeon dive. Not sure how deep or interesting the level design will get but the bosses, equipment and combat so far are cool. After an hour: I dig it. If it's the same play in hour 3, I'm done. Let's hope for more diverse abilities/spells/mobs/hazards/puzzles/things to destroy and not a broken random level generator - we shall see.",
