            "review_text": "Recommended game if you like Metal and action games. This one is pretty straight forward: Enter a room, beat all enemies and continue. So far i haven't finished the game yet, but since you can get permanent upgrades, the permadeath is not so punishing and the game gets a little bit easier with those. I highly recommend buying first of all the powerslide upgrade.",
