However, if you're looking for a game with an interesting/creepy story (containing grisly murders, a crazy therapist, and the supernatural) and LOTS of hidden object scenes, then this might be right up your alley. Really though, the whole game is reading through newspaper articles, journals, and emails - and in between, doing ho scenes. I really enjoyed it. Redrum: Dead Diary also has cards and is an easy Perfect game since all you have to do to obtain all the achievements is just play through it. DON'T buy this if you don't enjoy hidden object scenes. :p The rest of you... give this a look. :)",
