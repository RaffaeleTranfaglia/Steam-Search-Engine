            "review_text": "EDIT: When I first wrote this review, i didnt recomend it, to be honest I think I was wrong. As of today, there was an update, where there were some additions and fixes. There was one problem that I had that was the input lag, for me, it was unplayable with that in the game, but today it was fixed. I was actually suprised that the developer listened to our critisisms and didnt take them too harshley, which im greatfull for and this only made my intrest in the game peak, the fact that they made an extra update before the scheduled one for feb, was awesome. I hope you keep this up, because I can see this getting better and better over time. I apologise for not giving this a fair review and please, do take what you are about to read with a grain of salt. When more of the problems get fixed then ill edit this post to remove them! keep it up guys!  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  While this game is rough around the edges, animations are bad, key bindings are broken most of the time and the input lag it terrible, i do see some potential. This could be a great game if there was more time put into it.   THINGS I LIKED:  1. THE ATMOSPHERE IS GREAT, THERE WERE TIMES WHERE I ACTUALLY GOT SPOOKED 2. THE MUSIC IS NICE AND FITTING 3. THE OPTIONS ARE BETTER THAN MOST CHEAP INDIE GAMES CREATED WITH UNITY. THERE ARE SOUND BARS!!! 4. HAVING TO MANAGE YOUR HEALTH AND HUNGER GIVE YOU SOMETHING TO DO WHEN YOU ARE WALING ARROUND AND LOOTING ROOMS  THINGS I DISLIKED:  1. THE LACK OF VSYNC 3. THE ANIMATIONS ARE SUB-PAR I did find 1 or 2 bugs where the crosshair would dissapear and my weapon wouldn't swing, but at this current point in time, do I recomend it? no. There is lots of work to be done and while it is in early access, all I can say is that it needs improving, alot. If I come back to this in a future date, and some of the issues have been fixed, then I can reccomend it. Keep up the work guys, you have yourself a great idea here, you just need to work on executing it :)",
