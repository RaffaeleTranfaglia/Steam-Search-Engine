            "review_text": "What I love about scribblenauts is its creative problem solving and peaceful attitude. Problem: Did the children of the neighborhood land their ball on the old geezer's lawn that won't give it back?  Solution: Spawn a gun and kill him! It works! Problem: Nurse being chased by an angry heart? Solution: Spawn a gun and kill it! Problem: Want to contact a manager at the other side of a wall? Solution: Spawn a grenade launcher! Problem: Frozen people encased in ice? Solution: Spawn a flamethrower! Bonus: Watch their life points diminish as you melt/burn away! The thing that bugged me the most and made me sad is the cruelty towards animals. For example, as I visited a restaurant I made friends with a brown recluse spider and a cockroach, petting them and watching their happy little faces light up. Then some evil quest-giving person wanted me to kill them for a pest-control inspection, the nerve! And for a starlite fragment I had to kill my newly made bug friends?! What cruel madness is this! Also while going through the object shards achievements I had to prod a cow?! Shame on you scribblenauts. I hope they will fix those issues in future installments. In the meanwhile I will continue riding my black&amp;red huge supersonic fire-breathing dragon that is immune to damage, while going around helping people and making their lives better (sometimes with the use of supreme firepower).",

            "review_text": "This game just makes me happy when I play it. It's fun and I laugh a lot while I play it. Do you really need anything else from anything?   It's not a difficult game by any stretch as a simple story game of collecting stars to help save somethign from something with a lot of cool/cute art and object making. It lets you use your imagination to create an enormous amount of objects to just drop into the world and play with. Want a monkey? How about a GIANT monkey? You can make one and then ride it. Hilarious notebook? Sure. It will make every NPC that it passes by laugh. Create a Living Garden Gnome riding on a Tiny Goat. You can even create NPCs that will fight with one another, or even jsut play nice. Using adjectives in front of objects makes them even more interesting than they already are.  You can save objects you create in your backpack for easy access, you can get objects created by other Steam users in the Workshop with simple in-game menus and a couple clicks. Tons of user created stuff is amazing and hilarious so make sure to spend a good amount of time in the Steam Workshop for this game.   This is a Family Friendly game that anyone with a soul should play and enjoy. If you are a ginger, well we know you have no soul, but even YOU would probably be able to find some joy here.   It's an easy 100% Achievements game and they just take the time of finishing all the stars mostly and making objects they tell you to. Trading cards as well of course.   Fun and hilarious casual game for all ages!  NOTE: If you look at the credits and use the Developer's names to create in-game characters they will all appear in the game with some sort of special attribute. One dev NPC has the ability to turn every hat you put on them to spawn wings that you can take and fly with for example. There are a ton of these and it is fun to mess around with. You can view the credits at any time so write down some developer names and experiment in the game. :)",

The notebook enabled them to create anything they wanted, and the world globe allowed them go to any place they wanted. One day they were out and saw an old man, so went up to him. They gave him a rotten apple, but the old man was a wizard and bespelled Maxwells sister with a curse, gradually turning her into stone, every day it gets worse. Maxwell is sent on a quest to save his sister. They learned that Maxwell has to collect various starites, but the only way to obtain a starite is to make people happy.",

While it did not have the option to customize objects or use adjectives, most levels were both fun and challenging, forcing you to push your creativity's limits in order to reach the starite. Scribblenauts Unlimited allows much more depth with creating items, but the levels/puzzles do not reach beyond simply creating a category of object when prompted. There are no action levels in Scribblenauts Unlimited and as a result none of the levels are really challenging and there is no satisfaction in completing them. The object editor also allows you to create overpowered objects as well, decreasing what little challenge there is. It is fun to fool around with the object editor, but Scribblenauts Unlimited does not offer much depth beyond customizing your own objects.",

Now, with English not being my primary language, I learn a lot of new things through this game, and I like how I am sort of forced to learn words I rarely or never use in daily life.

This game has its quirks and sure there were many things i wish i could have made appear in this game, mostly im assuming to having a crude adult mind but again i think children are just as bad for that lets be honest here.  To be fair there isnt really anything about this game i would say is a deterrent as levels are creative and incorporate a smooth playability, everything works perfectly in tow and it gives you a good laugh here and there so that definitley helps, the only thing i could say is that i wish i could spawn more items and interesting objects that i would like to have been able to use and more playability, maybe a create my own level generator or even some sort of online playability though im not sure as to how much you could get from online, alas.  In any case in general i would say this game is pretty fun, especially for the younger generation and can be a bit educational as it can teach you proper spelling and more thinking outside the box, i give it an 8.5/10.",

Most of the puzzles are very straightforward, and allow the player to come up with many different solutions, but every now and then I would get stuck on something. Usually it was because the answer the game was looking for was something completely different than I was thinking, so it was unable to interpret how the objects I created were supposed to be a solution. So while the game is pretty smart considering you can input thousands of words, sometimes it just balks and has no idea what you're trying to do.  That said, it's still amazingly fun. There is a map where you can select different levels, each of which you can explore. Each zone has a funny theme, named with a funny grammar pun. The characters that you have to help are often silly and almost always endearing.  Steam achievements: Half of them are completed by being a completionist and making sure you finish every detail in every level. But then the other half of the achievements... don't seem to be listed anywhere. I had to go online to figure out what 'find all the object shards' entailed. It was basically a list of special word combinations, and if you spawned them together, or made the items interact with each other, then it counted toward the total score. For instance, one required you to make a marionette with the adjective 'alive' to get the 'Pinocchio' object shard. How in the world are you supposed to figure that out on your own? I needed a guide to figure out what I was looking for, but I didn't want to just run down a cheat sheet, so I searched for a guide that was simply a list of the object shards without the solutions. That was extremely helpful to get the achievements without feeling like a complete cheater. I looked and could not find a list like this anywhere within the game itself. If there is one in the game, it was pretty darn hidden, which is frustrating.  (Also, the game says you cannot type in proper nouns. However, one of the object shards requires you to create 'William Shakespeare'. The last time I checked, that was a proper noun. What? Okay, whatever.)  Object editor: So much fun! I didn't do much editing myself, what with my limited artistic skills. But when I found an avatar with 3D glasses, I dyed all of his clothes brown (except for the shoes, of course) and ran around the game, going, 'Woooo, I'm the Doctor!'  You can also search for and download other objects that people have created. I downloaded a bunch of Doctor Who objects. I was amazed at the amount of customization people were able to put into the objects, from a piece of celery inside of the TARDIS, to a banana in 9's hand, to the combatitiveness of a dalek. I had a great amount of fun playing with these items that other people had created with the object editor.",

            "review_text": "Firstly, let me say that I really enjoy, the game, but that I am also deeply disapointed at how much they seemed to have back tracked from their previous versions in a few ways. Although you can now edit your object and creations more than ever before, as well as get new and incredible creations from the steam commuity workshop and upload your own fairly easily, the most glaring flaw is that the game is also easier than ever before because the 'challenges' are not as intricate and put together as they used to be. In fact most of the shard 'challenges' are one-word-one-step solutions. So, although I fully recomend this game with its incredible library of possible creations, adjectives, and small challenges, this is also to say that it is not as great as it could be. If you can, i would fully recomend first buying SUPER scribblenauts on a different system (it's not on steam sadly) where you can experience the more developed gameplay. This said, it seems that by making the game easier and more user friendly, they are aiming at a younger audience, so if you wish, buy it for a child to enjoy, they likely won't notice the flaws or problems mentioned above. I hope you like the game as much as i do, even with these problems, i am happy i bought the game.   Also, on a side note, for those of you whom wish to try and get all those achievements on your game, this game is pretty nice. While it may take a bit of work past the end of the storyline to get all the achievements, they are all pretty straightforward and accessable, meaning you can very likely 100% the game if you put in the time. I would say it takes about 6-12 hours to do this depending on how familiar and witty you are at quickly and correctly   guessing   creating the wanted items. You'll need 60 starites to 'finish' the storyline and 107 to get all the achievements.  Enjoy!",

If the game cannot summon it, just hop on over to the workshop and see what others have made, or make it yourself with the painlessly easy object creator/editor. Suddenly you've got yourself a nuclear bacon launcher and catgirl with the face of an elder god in the game.

There is alot of fun to be had in having almost complete control over creation. The game clearly has a massive.. point, in helping children learn how to spell, and gives incentive to knowing masses of words.   For the adult audience, we get a more advanced version of enjoyment coming from already having gone through such education, and knowing these words already. While some words can come up with entirely odd things (If you type 'Lucifer' you get a blue shrimp.) most words that i've found, or used, tend to be extremely accurate so far as what they make.   The fact that Cthulhu is spawnable is one thing, but setting Cthulhu into battle against God, Satan and Odin can be hilarious. I personally like to let them all fight for a bit, and turn them into doves. However the puzzles tend to be extremely easy, and once you've got a few words that work, you'll tend to rely on them, to the exclusion of others.   This game is as fun as you have imagination. Sure, you can spawn rational objects and have a dull time, or you can run around with a giant flaming chocolate chainsaw, while riding a mechanical dragon and fighting ninja.

If you aren't familiar with Scribblenauts the game is basically a puzzle game that you have to use your imagination to solve the puzzles.   The story revolves around a boy who gains ownership of a magical notebook. Anything that the boy writes in the notebook becomes real. Similarly, the words you type into the game appear before your eyes. If I were to type floating spotted firebreathing bathtub, then thats exactly what I would see appear in the game.  The puzzles are mostly very simple, though I would still say its fun for all ages as I am an adult and even I had fun playing it.  The only flaws the game has are that many of the puzzles are very similar and you tend to solve them the same way. The game usually doesn't put any kind of restriction on how many times you can use a word, which means i can solve 10 puzzles the same way if I wanted to which I feel takes away from the puzzle aspect of the game.  For instance, once i found out i could add attributes to my own character, i made him 'invisible superspeed tiny flying invincible' which lets you beat the missions in probably half the usual time or less but again takes away from the fun of the game. My only other complaint is that theres not much in the game that can kill you, even the things that do attack you take so many hits to kill you that you can easily stop them. They should have included a difficulty setting in the games menu.  Conclusion: Over all I would give Scribblenauts a 8/10 in the category of childrens puzzle games. I would value it at up to 15$.

Controls are simple and intuitive, though sometimes a bit slower than need be. Level design and exploration is creative and engaging, with fun visuals that are unique for most levels.   The downside of this game is that there really isn't much challenge. Most of the time, solutions are painfully obvious as soon as soon as the puzzle is presented. Even though there are hundreds of possible solutions to a puzzle like 'The student is hungry!' there's limited fun in finding out the most obscure food that the game recognizes.   Levels are expansive, but predictable. Within each larger area, you'll find a handful of sub-levels that contain a handful of starite fragments, as well as a full starite earned by completing a sub-sub level. Although the locations and characters you encounter are varied and interesting, this continued structure leaves the game feeling flat...almost bringing up memories of games like 'Mario is Missing.'   Although as an adult I've always been drawn to the charm of Scribblenauts' promise to allow the player to create anything, this game's vocabulary seemed more limited to me than the initial title. Yes, you can apply adjectives now, but that's rarely important to gameplay.   Scribblenauts Unlimited is a good game, though it's formulaic gameplay could end up turning a lot of people off. There is some appeal to gamers of all ages, but this feels distinctly like a game for children.",

Travel around a cartoon universe solving everyones problems with a notebook that creates whatever you can write in it.

The problems the Protagonist receives are more like puzzles to be solved by the object created from the notebook. In some cases I created logical guesses to solving problems in the notebook, and did not receive a disirable result. It still needs work but none the less its entertaining. I played through half of the game and received little challenge to solving puzzles so its easy to pick up. I'm keen to finish it and definately reccomend this game.",

You play as young Maxwell who uses a magic notepad to bring his imagination's fancies into reality in order to help others. You string together nouns and adjectives and then objects spawn into (or disappear from) existence. The game provides base objectives that can be satisfied as practically or ridiculously as you'd like. You might be tasked with rescuing someone from a wild animal intent on attacking. You can create a weapon for defense, create a barricade to keep the animal out, bring forth the Loch Ness Monster to frighten it, or simply modify the animal itself to make it less hostile.  Previous (console and mobile only) Scribblenauts titles offered the core notepad gameplay with very few trimmings. One would select a level from a menu and complete a single multi-stage objective. Unlimited offers a much richer and more complete adventure driven by a story that explains Max's past and gives him motivation to seek out and assist people. There is a large world to explore, divided into distinct regions that contain thematically similar places to visit. Within each area there are now several more minor tasks of assistance for Max to carry out in addition to the traditional multi-stage type of challenge.  High resolutions are supported, there are no more limits on object creation, objects can be attached to each other (fire hydrant and hose), favorite creations can be remembered for quick re-spawning, and the game features Steam Workshop integration for continual communal expansion.",

Maxwell also with his Sister Lily with her Magic Globe in which can teleport them anywhere in the world.  You can create literally anything and share them on the Workshop.  The extent of the creativity is amazing, 'Flying giant rainbow Chicken' is a favourite of mine in which it literally does summon a giant chicken in rainbow colours that can fly and i can ride anywhere. Another example is 'deadly evil magical apple' in which summons an Apple which magically moves around and attacks people. The creativity is endless and with this creativity you can use this ability to help people with their problems and activities like helping a chef prepare a meal, help a cat get down off a burning tree, repair a broken robot etc. but also with the creativity you do not have to literally do as they expect as you could help a chef cook his meal with dead body parts and toxic waste and it comes out it many ways or help a man get ready for a date and you can give him a dead rose or a gun and she will love it no matter what.

The game has a vast variety of puzzles with every single one of them having lots of solutions and all of them fun. The game isn't hard by any means. There are a few semi-difficult moments but that's about it. All of the gameplay however is fun and imaginitive. You can create pretty much anything from the vast variety of words available and have fun with it. The puzzles are, as I said, vast. All of them are unique. Some of them are longer and gives you an entire set of instructions to do. Some are just like 'This woman is complaining about her legs' (I made her legless for the record) They're simple and fun and all manners of answers are accepted. This game gets a 9/10 from me, for what it does. GET IT NOW!",

            "review_text": "To sum up this review right away, I will say this is one of the funnest time-wasting pseudo-sandbox games I have ever played. Now onto the real reason why:  Scribblenauts has you playing Maxwell, a little boy with the ability to make anything appear, change, shift, etc. with his handy dandy notebook. His sister Lilly is sick with some weird disease so he has to go out into the world and find little shards of star thingies called 'starites' which will hopefully make her all better.   This game is part messing around with whatever strikes your fancy (aka a sandbox), part puzzle, and part adventure. It also requires a little bit of thinking and creativity to get past some head-scratching or seemingly impossible tasks. This game is designed to tap into the ingenious little child you once were, where the possibilities to accomplish anything were endless and only limited by your imagination. You need to get a ball off an old man's lawn without touching the lawn itself? Fly yourself over the lawn in a helicopter and pick it up! Need to get past a killer robot? Dress yourself up in a suit of armor to deflect the attacks!   The art is adorable, the animations seemless and what is humorous to note is to watch how the objects you've brought to life interact with other objects, creatures, and people long after you've set them free or completed a mission. I find myself accidentally unleashing less-than-friendly little beasties on the unsuspecting populace, much to their depleting heart bar and my wry schadenfreude. The music also fits well with every place you go, perfectly setting the tone to where you are and what you're doing. I have not had the chance to mess with the object editor but from what I can tell by popping in and taking a look around it only adds to the possibilities of further customization of your little adventure.  It is at times so easy to earn starite shards that I sometimes feel like I'm progressing too fast and not enjoying it for what it is, namely a pleasant time-waster, as I've said before. Personally, I find that you can tell a lot about yourself by what beings you bring into the Scribblenaut world to solve your problems. For 'man's best friend' I always type in some breed of terrier, and when I can afford to I always use sponges to clean stuff up. Is it familiarity or my lack of thinking outside the box that makes me lean towards these choices? Who knows.  This is a fun game that unlocks the imaginative kid in all of us, and for kids that know their way around a computer this is the perfect game for them to play, too.",

When I noticed there was a version of the game on steam, i immediately decided to get it.   This is not something i regret. There is alot of fun to be had in having almost complete control over creation. The game clearly has a massive.. point, in helping children learn how to spell, and gives incentive to knowing masses of words.   For the adult audience, we get a more advanced version of enjoyment coming from already having gone through such education, and knowing these words already. While some words can come up with entirely odd things (If you type 'Lucifer' you get a blue shrimp.) most words that i've found, or used, tend to be extremely accurate so far as what they make.   The fact that Cthulhu is spawnable is one thing, but setting Cthulhu into battle against God, Satan and Odin can be hilarious. I personally like to let them all fight for a bit, and turn them into doves. However the puzzles tend to be extremely easy, and once you've got a few words that work, you'll tend to rely on them, to the exclusion of others.   This game is as fun as you have imagination. Sure, you can spawn rational objects and have a dull time, or you can run around with a giant flaming chocolate chainsaw, while riding a mechanical dragon and fighting ninja.

On another level you have to give a halfling something to throw into a volcano. Afterwhich, he rides off on an eagle.

When you look at Scribblenauts first time it seems like ordinary colorfull game for kids where you help everybody (and everythink) by creating things by writing them in you're magic notebook. And you know wath ? Maybe its a game for kids about helping humanity with their problems. It may sound odd, however this game brought me much more fun that many 'adult' games. The whole positive music, the posibilities, the awkwardness (i guess thats a word), and mostly just happiness that brings helping everybody made this game one of my most loved title. (Small hint-before buying this game first try it out somehow. Its a really good game, however its not a thing that everybody would like)",

            "review_text": "This is undoubtedly the definitive version of Scribblenauts. It’s especially well-suited to PC, with the mouse for precision item-building and placement, and the keyboard for quick, no-fuss item generation. Furthermore, the object editor adds some extra depth to the experience, offering creative folk the opportunity to create abominations that act as they deem fit.  Starite collection isn’t mindless in this instalment; while fleeting, there has been an effort to give meaning to Maxwell’s journey. His life and family’s history are also delved into. The premise of Maxwell’s grand quest is odd, but charming in a way: Maxwell’s twin sister, Lily, is cursed by an old beggar whom Maxwell played a trick on. Starites, apparently, are able to stop Lily’s body from petrifying, so Maxwell sets out to do good deeds and acquire the cure for his sister. Along the way, Maxwell will run into all forty of his other siblings—that’s right, Maxwell’s folks have forty-two kids. The siblings are an eclectic bunch, and once found, may be used instead of Maxwell as the playable avatar. The other siblings don’t add depth to the plot, but they’re fun to find nonetheless.   The level editor from previous games has been replaced with an object editor, which allows the player to create *virtually* anything, although they must start with a base object (Eg., “Cat”). Thereafter, the base object may be adorned with whatever suits the creator’s whim, and colours and textures offer added appeal. The editor also enables the player to alter/add/remove a wide range of behaviours and attributes, which can have hilarious or disastrous results. Usually the latter, but that only adds to the fun. The object may also be renamed, and that name need not stick to any naming conventions.   5th Cell have done away with linear progression and opted for something far more versatile; perhaps the most welcomed change to this version of Scribblenauts is the player’s ability to traverse the large overworld in an unrestrained fashion. While they will need to collect a certain number of Starites to unlock neighbouring chunks of map, the available chunk of map contains several areas the player can discover at their own leisure, in any order they choose. One can skip the trek and simply select each area from the map menu, though there seems to be greater reward in discovering each area on foot.   Scribblenauts Unlimited is full of curious and sometimes head-scratching puzzles, all of which are a delight to solve. For the first time, players are able to create their own objects to solve puzzles and/or hassle NPCs—both equally fun. Players are offered a lot of freedom in this game, which is another first, and definitely a step in the right direction. My only quibble is the complete lack of multiplayer, or a level editor that can be used to create scenarios for friends to stumble through.",

He does this by doing good deeds for people using a magic book that create anything you type in. Theres lots of different themed levels ,such as underwater or in space to name a couple, full of NPCs that need your help. Most of it is pretty simple but the game lets you be quite creative in how you handle the NPCs requests. You can also pretty much spawn anything you can think of excluding sex related or copyrighted items (yet it still has all kinds of weapons and some requests have a bit of dark humour to them).   Good points: - the range of stuff you can spawn is really impressive. Everything from guns to food, helicopters to banks, Napoleon to Cthulu, if you can thinkof something its proabably there. The game also includes Steam Workshop support where even more things are uploaded or you can have a go at creating something yourself. -the game has universal appeal. Simple and colourful enough for kids to enjoy with pop culture and humour that can appeal to older gamers. - the game has a nice colourful charm and the variety of levels is nice as well  Bad points: - once the initial novelty of being able to spawn whatever you want wears off it does start to get a little dull. You do pretty much the same thing in everylevel. Running around to NPC's spawning what they need rinse and repeat.",

The puzzles are quite enjoyable and humorous if you can finish it in an unlikely manner (like putting out a huge fire with a microscopic raindrop). You can also make weapons and mounts and clothes. You dress up as a samurai with a blue mouldy bazooka riding a flying robotic squid through the sky. Or a knight with a rusty cheese knife riding an orange shoe.  The possibilities in this game are endless and I'm sure that you'll enjoy blowing things up with explosive goats and laughing at the humorous results just as much as I do (If you meet the imagination requirements).",

This or Unmasked?  I own both and i reccomend this one before. Unmasked is a great game, but it is limited to creativity compared to this one. Im not saying don't buy unmasked, it is great, but i like this one more.  in the end, Scribblenauts Unlimited may have some limits, but it is one of the greatest games you can buy.",

            "review_text": "Scribblenauts Unlimited is a very creative and good, clean fun sort of game, which takes the usual monotonous and time-waster style of puzzle games which flood the market by storm. It's a very unique blend of sandbox creativity and puzzle action, which we don't often see on the steam market. You play as a odd-looking character named Maxwell as you go around the world solving problems and helping others, and collecting Starites. The game has very freeing gameplay, with no linear path to follow in order to complete the game, and is packed with gimmicks which allow you to express your creativity and ideas, while also letting you explore the great depths of the game's enormous vocabulary library. Yes, this game is like a dictionary in disguise, letting you spawn anything that you desire into the game, whether it be a flying bathtub or a evil chicken which shoots lasers. You are given a notebook which allows you to write an object into, spawning it in-game. This gimmick allows you to solve level puzzles, or just have a bit of fun messing around with what you can write. Another creative feature is the Object Editor, a whole sub section of the game which allows you to basically design an object of your imagination. The Object Editor has a steam workshop, which allows you to download other people's creations and play around with them.The Object Editor is easy to use, although it is a tiny bit limiting in the amount of 'stamps' that can be used for one creation. Overall, the game's unique features make it a game that's hard to get bored of. The visual in Scribblenauts Unlimited are stunning, with bright colours and a beautiful art style. As for the music, it's great. It's vibrant and has great variety, but I must say that the music in the previous Scribblenauts games were a bit more memorable and tuneful. The story gameplay is simple, and a lot easier than previous Scribblenauts games, which means that the story mode can be completed with every Starite fairly quickly. The slight difficulty drop doesn't necessarily mean that it is in any way bad, but it's considerably less challenging than some other games. The puzzles are creative, don't get me wrong, but there isn't any challenge proggession as the game goes on. Overall, Scribblenauts Unlimited does what it needs to do. It's fun, light-hearted, creative and give you alot of freedom to mess about. I would say, if you like what you see in the trailers, or you have played the other games,you will not be dissapointed. 9/10",
