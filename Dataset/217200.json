Mostly because it's kinda newly released in Steam, but also because I've played it a lot with  friends the recent weeks.   Worms Armageddon is a game that's made to play with friends, if you have nothing to do between playing a game of CS:GO and are too tired to get back to your Campaign in Civilization V, than look at Worms Armageddon. With Worms Armageddon you can murder your friends with a Banana Bomb, or throw a huge metal Donkey on them.  The game has a wide variety with weapons, everything from MMA to rocket launchers.   If you see a worm on the edge of the beach, should you kill him with your shotgun or perhaps your grenade?  Or why not only stand beside him and push him into the water. (Protip: Worms can't swim)  The game is 2D and you can only walk to the left and right, and jump. There is a map creator so you wont ever  run out of maps, I can also recommend playing on an empty map, just try it, It's fun.  Either way, if you are bored and have friends, get this game, play it with them.   You won't regret it! (Hopefully)",

            "review_text": "The best artillery game ever made and one of the best turn-based strategy games ever made. This ain't an opinion, this game still holds up today and it was released almost 17 years ago.  PROS: - Timeless, humorous 2d graphics that make even the most gruesome worm death look funny. - Rewarding turn-based gameplay that focuses on strategy and being careful. One small mistake can ♥♥♥♥ your whole game up. - Randomly generated levels provide a new experience every single game, and if that's not good enough for you, you can even make your own levels. You spoiled ♥♥♥♥♥ucker. - Customization options up the ♥♥♥♥in ♥♥♥, you can set your team of worms to speak Chinese or even Polish for christ's sake. Although granted the Polish voice is annoying as ♥♥♥. - The soundtrack kicks ♥♥♥ even after 2 decades. There's nothing like sneaking around and setting a stick of lit dynamite under a worms ♥♥♥ while some super sexy bass line plays in the background. ♥♥♥♥. - The developers, Team 17, still and I mean STILL support this game. It's 2016 and they're still releasing patches and fixes for this ♥♥♥♥in game man. Now that's dedication. This ain't like modern games where the devs abandon that ♥♥♥♥ after like 2 months. These guys are the real deal. Team 17, just for that, I'll let all of you bang my wife. Free of charge. You guys earned it.  CONS: - The AI is infamous in this game because it blatantly ♥♥♥♥ing cheats. Jesus christ, I can't tell you how many times I've wanted to punch a hole through my monitor over the years because some ♥♥♥♥ing smug computer-controlled worm threw a grenade across the ♥♥♥♥in level that just so happened to land right next to my worm. I can't really complain about this though because it just makes the game more challenging, so stop being such a ♥♥♥♥♥.  BUY THIS GAME, NERD.",

While there are others with similar sized arsenals, most were just full of filler weapons. Not this one.   Seriously, if you don't own this game, buy it now. If you do, play it some more. If you're Team 17, bring back Patsy's Magic Bullet, the Mole Squadron and the Priceless Ming Vase. Please?",

My second being Worms 2, which was also available on disk for PC.  - A casual, 2D side-scroller  - A game of war between worms, vs AI, PvP, or campaign modes.  - Customisable with voices (die a brave hero, or scream like a little girl)  - Create your own maps and terrain    Slightly sad that the mini movies as the game started up were not included, I loved watching those!

This game, which, other than World Party, was the last good Worms game, contains more weapons and enjoyability than all the new games combined. And for the haters crying 'why is there no customization?' there is tons of it! You can customize yourself with an auto-tuned death cry, a flag, a tombstone, a team name, and your 8-worm team of soldiers with names you choose. 'No hats?' I hear you crying, who in the hell cares? Just get your head out of the dirt and dodge this well-placed air strike. 'Bad graphics' my ♥♥♥, this thing looks better than having a worm with a water baloon for a head 'Revolution I'm looking at you.' I think I'm done ranting now. Just buy a couple copies with your friends and have some bloody good fun, with all the exploding sheep you'll ever want.",

It's hard to articulate exactly how perfect and balanced this is. Maybe it's the range of weapons that includes your typical bazookas and grenades alongside magic bullets and sheep strikes. Maybe it's the way it feels so much more responsive over all other iterations allowing for perfectly timed ninja rope swings. Hell maybe it's just nostalgia. One thing I can say though is that even after 15+ years, this game is THE Worms game that we all love and play. It's THE gold standard of Worms games that has yet to be matched.

During the effort of turning the franchise up-to-date-ish, putting it in 3D did not help the game mechanics at all. Nothing was as much fun as SuperSheep-ing the hell out of the opponent in the good old 2D.   Fortunately Worms Revolution realised that and re-discovered that perspective again using 3D just as briefly as it should have been used from the beginning so it is some sort of follow-up of Woms Armageddon where this game concept worked the best. It is a challenging game with a sense of humour and some nasty hostilities against your opponents. It is best to play hotseat (like in old times) with a couple of friends. After 10 rounds and a couple of holy grenade drops and ninja rope swings, the term 'friend' will get a new meaning.  May the concrete donkey be with you.",
