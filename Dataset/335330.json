            "review_text": "this game is meh, just meh, BUT there is more to this game.  -WEAPONS- there IS alot of good weapons, like the tarantula-41 (ppsh-41) and there is the basic weapons, which I might recommend investing in weapon gems, because hey, i know the basic weapons might be bad, but try to upgrade them. -ARMOR AND GEAR- so, let's get armored. so YOU can get swat armor, basic armor as well. AND there is ammo pouches, and cosmetics like canteens, backpacks, and also some more stuff. -PLAYERS AND PLAYERBASE- there is ALOT kids who play this game, well some do anyway, but i am 14, and i play this game AND i am really good, good that some kids might call hax on me, but i don't hack, ever. and i get there might be SOME hackers, but seriously, no one likes hackers, especially in call of duty. -THINGS THAT COULD BE IN THE GAME- Fairfight-an anti cheat that can show the name of the hacker banned on your screen.  No p2w elements-seriously, THIS is why people hate this game so bad, because brick-force is p2w. i suggest keeping the force points AND remove the tokens, seriously, the game needs more positives, but no trolls, definately no trolls, and i'm sorry if i typed definately wrong. More Force Points and Experience (XP)-another thing people hate, people hate the low force point and experience rates. i suggest more FP and XP be gained through matches. Unlock system-wish you can unlock stuff? well, warface has that, rainbow six vegas 2 also has that, call of duty as well. BUT, brick force should get that system, IMAGINE, how much greater would it be to unlock something PERMANENTLY. yes, that is PERFECT! if the devs were nice enough to do that, anyways.  all i have to say is: this game is ok. i think the devs should put the nice features in this game, hopefully. so i think this game should better, well, ANYONE could like these features i talked about. so, here is my end review. 8/10 ok game, needs no p2w features, and most importantly, NO HATERS, seriously, none.",

How about where all games start, the log-in  This game did not except my email or username,anything witha hypen is banned,Except the TITLE OF THE GAME HAS A HYPEN  second,my computer hates this game, never has this happened. My Anti-Malaware gave a (Are you sure?) before i downloaded this game.it even had this bootleg anti-virus called X VIRUS..or something,it scared the crap out of me because i thought this game was a trojan and i would lose my computer.Thats a bad sign developers!  and once i got to play, this game did not impress me  it automatically puts you into a tutorial. it shows your the controls and weapons (i will talk about those later) it also has building elements like (minecraft)........its not obvious that this game rips off minecraft infact IT IS A SELLING POINT.  and with some games adding creativity (Like terraria) this game is both TF2 (even if it says call of duty it is still TF2) and this game shares the same problems with Blockade 3D as in that you have to pick the right weapon or you lose, that or you just get points of idle players.  and i like FPS games like Unturned, murder miners and TF2. so i dont hate the style, (i think it is overused) but FPS's can still be fun.  ALSO PAY TO PLAY IS FEATURED, but i think all free games can get away with this, usually.   Never in my life as a gamer have i been more scared downloading a game. its bootleg anti-virus,wierd login, it reaks of thievery, its unexceptable to think after scaring me like that I would still give them money, i did not.   this game gets a 1/10, i do see some sort of game,but i hate all game there, Just play TF2,Unturned or Murder miners all are better games than this. and for the first time, i hate this game. ive done a lot of bad reviews for games, but those games tried. but this one, I HATE IT DONT DOWNLOAD IT",

Grease and line two 20cm/8in sandwich tins.   2.For the cake, place all of the cake ingredients, except the boiling water, into a large mixing bowl. Using a wooden spoon, or electric whisk, beat the mixture until smooth and well combined.    3.Add the boiling water to the mixture, a little at a time, until smooth. (The cake mixture will now be very liquid.)   4.Divide the cake batter between the sandwich tins and bake in the oven for 25-35 minutes, or until the top is firm to the touch and a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean.   5.Remove the cakes from the oven and allow to cool completely, still in their tins, before icing.   6.For the chocolate icing, heat the chocolate and cream in a saucepan over a low heat until the chocolate melts. Remove the pan from the heat and whisk the mixture until smooth, glossy and thickened. Set aside to cool for 1-2 hours, or until thick enough to spread over the cake.   7.To assemble the cake, run a round-bladed knife around the inside of the cake tins to loosen the cakes. Carefully remove the cakes from the tins.   8.Spread a little chocolate icing over the top of one of the chocolate cakes, then carefully top with the other cake.   9.Transfer the cake to a serving plate and ice the cake all over with the chocolate icing, using a palette knife.
