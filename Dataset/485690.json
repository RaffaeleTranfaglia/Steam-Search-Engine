            "review_text": "The amount of mislabeled items in this game is so far beyond acceptable. Nearly every single HO scene contained items that were mislabeled so far from what they actually were the only way to complete the scenes was to repeatedly hit the hint button or randomly click around. Maddening. I'm not talking about simple mistakes... I'm talking about plumbing pipes being mislabeled as trumpets... and fishing rods mislabled as winches.   The puzzles were brain dead simple too. Difficulty level on this one is incredibly low.   Aside from the many dysfunctional gameplay elements and mechanics, the story itself was interesting, and the artwork isn't half bad.",

It would say literally bottle but mean the coke can or say key and mean a wrench. but then in the next puzzle say key and mean a doll. But other then that it was a nice little time waster",

The hidden object parts can be misleading (some names don't match the stuff you need to find), the puzzles are too easy - in almost all of them you need to flip things once and it's solved. Also my language wasn't translated properly and some words had errors or missing letters.  The story is not so bad, I guess. But overall it's a waste of money. Don't buy it even on sale.",

The game really has two elements: looking/using the hint button to get random objects to solve simple puzzles with and the iSPY part where you have to find a bunch of items in order to obtain a secret item.   Story wise its kinda crap and I kinda guessed what was going to happen but overall the gameplay made it enjoyable for me.",

The story keeps you interested and, while the cutscenes may be a little lackluster, the mini games were hard but for the most part stayed with the theme of the game and, minus some language issues (in some locations 'keys' and 'wrench' were mixed up for some reason?) it was never necessarily impossible. It made me think and it stayed interesting and fairly exciting the entire way through. Some parts were a lot more tricky than others (I reached a point in the game where there were no actions I could perform according to my map) but the game is mostly smooth sailing.",
