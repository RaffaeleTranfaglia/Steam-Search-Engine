            "review_text": "I wanted to give the game a chance since I really like top down shooters. It seemed to be in the style of old classics like 'Desert Storm' for the Amiga. But even that game had a better handling 20 years ago than Heli Heroes. The controls are bad, the camera is shaky and tends to fade out completely. The action is lackluster, the aiming isn't good and there just Isn't much to do overall. Yes, I only played the game 20 minutes, but believe me, those 20 minutes are enough to make up your mind. I won't install it again and I can't recommend buying or playing it since it's both, a waste of time and money.",

There is so much wrong with this game, You can fly though moantains, missiles that should hit mis you, ''strategy'' = just hold down shift and ctrl and to top it off you have to hear the most terrible voice acting in your life with every kill you make.  If that wont stop you buying this game then you are a true Hero!  PS: Dont judge me i got this 1 for free!! :'(",
