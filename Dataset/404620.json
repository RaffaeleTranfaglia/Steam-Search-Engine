            "review_text": "What the heck?  This is the same game as 'The Political Machine 2012', but with different canditdates, and slightly different issues!  Stardock has been releasing these games since at least '08 and every version feels just about the same.   There is SO much they could do to make this game much better:  -Third Party system.  -Steam workshop integration. If Stardock doesn't want to add more content, why not let the community?  -Third Party system.  -More customization parts. Seriously, this game doesn't have ANY new parts to make your characters!  -Third Party system.  -Some form of map editor maybe? Why not make a way to customize the money, population, electorial votes, ect, of all the states?  -Third Party system.  -Debates. How about a Debate system where every few turns or so, you and other candidates take turns not just making statements about different issues, but also engaging with each other on the issues? Perhaps each candidate could have another stat determining how well they can do in the debates.  -Third Party system.   -Primary elections anyone?  -WHERE THE HECK IS THE THIRD PARTY SYSTEM?! The community has been asking for YEARS to add a way to make your own party, or just go independent, or something!   Please Stardock hear our cries...  EDIT 3/1/2016: I'd like to point out that none of my criticisms are a reflection of my political views. I'm purely saying what I think can improve this game.",

Not much as been added rather than changed issues, and a new list of candidates for the 2016. Don't get me wrong, I like TPM, but an extra $10 ($5 on a sale) dollars for the same game isn't worth it. Unfortunately, the devs didn't add primaries/debates/other scenarios, which left much to be desired. Hopefully since it's early access, they'll do so, but I'm not expecting it.  EDIT: Devs also removed the 2012 version from the Steam Store, possibly to not compete with the current edition as it was slightly cheaper.  postdata: TRUMP MADE ANIME REAL",

Its worth the 10 dollars, trust me. Hang on cat needs food................................................... ok sorry bout that. Anyway its worth 10 bucks. Its the funnest experience ive had in a while. Playing with friends and their wacky characters is the best. Even if you're playin with a random person. In conclusion its an amazing game so buy it. Its worth it i promise.  P.S.- Hipster lincoln is a cool idea for a character, just sayin. Also another character idea, Trumps hair or Wizard Reagan.",

It comes equipped with many candidates, each with a unique playstyle, and a create your own candidate feature.  Also included is an accurate representation of the many intricacies of American politics, as well as lots of up to date and current issues.  Pro Tip: Even if you aren't a Democrat/Republican, it is a good idea to oppose and support issues that benifit the majority. As an example, say you're in Oregon, and you're a Democrat, but most of the population is Republican. While it might seem like a good idea to reduce gas prices because that benefits Democrat and Independant leaning voters, it is actually a much better idea to increase gas prices, a more Republican leaning option, as the Republican leaning voters will say 'Hey, these Democrat guys are actually pretty cool!' and decide to become Democrat leaning voters.  On an unrelated note, it is a sad, sad day for the world when Donald Trump becomes president (Good bye, Russia, China, South America, Canada, Africa, UK, Germany, Korea, and Japan. I hope it's over quickly when you get blasted by a few hundred nuclear warheads).  9/10, needs less Republican presidents and a smoother learning and difficulty curve. ",

This game really is overall decent, but it isn't much more than decent. Like others have suggested, it would take relatively little to turn this into a great game. I highly suggest to the developers that the following features would make this game an absolute home run:  More Talk Show Opportunities/Personalities, with more questions and options. Debates Primaries Third Parties Speeches/Ads more dynamic and impactful in nature 'Issues' Rework (It feels silly I can only have a weak opinion on ~ten issues and that's it)  It isn't a ton to add, but I think it would turn this minigame into a full, good game.]  P.S.
