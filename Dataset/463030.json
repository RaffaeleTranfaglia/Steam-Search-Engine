            "review_text": "Bottle is a  first person walking simulator , where you follow the path in a  snowy landscape  and with the help of a  mysterious person  you will find letters, that makes you familiar with the story. The game is short, so do not expect from game some kind of a massive story. The graphic is really good and i liked that the game is very  bright, fresh and soothing . I liked the music too, it was really enjoyable to walk on the path and hear some  sounds of nature  like wind, birds, trees and water. The big plus for achievement hunters is that this game has a  7 easy achievements  so you can do 100% game. I think this game could feel free to have a longer story and they should add tone of horror game.  The low price  is really fair to the fact, that game is just walking simulator and it is really short. I recommend this game for screenshooters because there's a lot of positions that may make seriously unique screenshots.    + fair price + relaxing music + noir mode (great addition to a game)  - short story     Walk Noir  After passing game you can play a new mode - walk noir. Already the name implies that it will have something to do with black or dark color. It is a new mode in which you follow the same path but the  graphic is darker . If you want 100% achievements, you have to also complete it.  8/10",

At the time I played this, it was raining outside and I really just wanted to go for a walk to think about things--this game gave the feeling of walking alone with your thoughts. Recommended for folks who like non-traditional games.",

            "review_text": "This game is true art. Stunning visuals combined with perfectly fitting classical piano music is what will give you goosebumps while playing this. The poetry in the game is great.  All I missed in this game is more building around the story, the introduction to a story is given, but perhaps more narration would have been great.  You can get in this game and be done with it in no more than twenty minutes, but if you take your time this is truly an enchanting gem!  I recommend Bottle to patient and art-loving people, so if you would categorize yourself as one of these, please, go ahead and spend those two bucks and judge for yourself!",

            "review_text": "Bottle is a short, walking simulator. That fact, in and of itself, should deliniate who might like this title. It doesn't contain any traditional gaming elements, and the 'story' is minimalistic to the point of being opaque. That said, it looks very nice, is well thought-out, and contains pleasant music.   For folks who are drawn to walking-simulators, note that this title is developed by a single person. I'd caution against comparing it too harshly against similar titles like Dear Esther, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, or Lifeless Planet. It lacks the philosophical 'depth' of Dear Esther and has none of the puzzle elements of Ethan Carter or Lifeless Planet. It is also much shorter. Each of those other titles aspire to different goals than Bottle, which foresakes plot, narration, and interactivity for beauty and mood.  It accomplishes that goal very well. Just be aware of what you're buying when you purchase this title--a very short, pretty walking-sim with a minimal artifice of plot.",

The athmosphere and environment was alright but nothing special really. Didn't bother buying though, it only cost 1.99 €, I can give that to the creator.",
