Less amount of weapons, which was something good, no longer having to toggle between 3 handguns or taping flashlights to all of them since you now carry one. Nice acting, decent story, hopefully someday another Obscure will appear.",

The enviroment/setting for the game is done well! Monsters feel/look scary. If you are a silent hill fan or resident evil fan, then this game is for you!  Pros Aiming system is improved from the first obscure Local coop supported music IMPROVED interface variety of monsters horror feel Many secret items to find Puzzles Switch characters (each character has a special trait)  Cons Ai for single player is terrible when fighting bosses or monsters",

            "review_text": "I just can't do it, the first Obscure game grasped what a B movie horror is, even though it had it's clunky stuff with the controls and the exaggerated ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ characters, but the redeeming factor of these issues were that the controls were working and the characters didn't get screen time, the cutscenes were minimal. Now Obscure 2 made these two so f'ing bad, that I can't bear to play this game anymore.  The controls were reworked to some TPS/classical survival horror controls hybrid and it's awful. Just in the first five minutes my character wasn't visible on the screen while I was controlling it. The camera angles are changing by themselves and you can control them too, it's just something I think don't work well together, especially when the execution is so terrible. I have no idea why they implemented this TPS type of feel to the game, the combat is more hectic and chaotic from it, you autolock on stuff and you press left click hoping that they will die before your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI partner does. Sure, you can play co-op, but I don't know anybody in a 10 mile area who wants to play Obscure 2, ♥♥♥♥ me I guess. Also the enemies are faster, which makes the left clicking and AI not keeping distance even more exciting.  And the storytelling, there are too many dialogues. This sounds ridiculous, but hear me out. When you have annoying teens as your characters who are also underdeveloped and dumb as ♥♥♥♥ you probably want to use them simply as moving flesh to hack. But no, Obscure 2 had to make them talk every 2 minutes, using cringe-worthy and overacted lines. You probably saw it coming, but the voice acting is obviously terrible, so that doesn't help the case.  The only positive thing is that they toned down the loud and unfitting music from the first game, they do this rarely now. The atmosphere also stayed the same as in the first game (not considering the constant hair pulling from the things read above), which is great.  If you liked the first one maybe, but only if you feel like you can handle the more trashy nature of this game than that one.",

            "review_text": "I would recommend the game itself but not here. The entire thing is a plain stupid port for PC, thank you Bandai Namco games! I see my mouse ingame which is a bug due to steam overlay, the same as in Dark Souls and its also from the same company who did Dark Souls and they haven't fixed that bug in Dark Souls so why should they fix it here? are the developners ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for not seeing that or ignoring that problem? The game also laggs like hell for me on my high end system while Obscure I has better 'widescreen support' and runs smoothly while Obscure 2 laggs, ♥♥♥♥ING LEGIT It would be fine if I could just play with my controller but apprently the game only supports Xbox 360 controllers GOOD ♥♥♥♥ING WORK ITS NOT LIKE THE GAME CAME OUT FOR PS2 AND SO ON AND DOING SUPPORT FOR THOSE CONTROLLERS IS NOT HARD AT ALL. Also I readed online that they announced widescreen feature, well, TOO BAD ITS NOT ♥♥♥♥ING WIDESCREEN...got black bars on the side, Im seeing my mouse ingame, the controllers dont get supported, just WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥? I feel extremely betrayed for my money, I mean this is just plain stupid, its not that hard to polish the game a little up. I mean the game itself is great and incredible, especially in coop but with all these 'problems' I rather download the game per torrent now cause there I dont have this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. As long as they at least did not implement widescreen support, DO NOT BUY. If they did you might have some fun while always seeing your mouse ingame..or maybe you got a Xbox 360 controller after all but im not a fan of that. To summarize that: Unplayable -&gt; strong lag on high end system/obscure I runs fine and stuff like Metro2033 too, no widescreen, seeing my mouse ingame, no proper controller support  3/9/2015 STILL NO WIDESCREEN SUPPORT You can choose 1920x1080 but black bars -.- Still continueing with the Retail version...",

            "review_text": "Obscure 2 is a dissapointing sequel to Obscure. While it still eschews teen horror clichés and quite a bit of intentional cheesiness and campiness, the game for some reason includes monster ♥♥♥♥, monster pregnancy and suicide which are very jarring to the overall tone of the game. The gameplay is fun if unpolished and the combat system is even clunkier than O1.  If you long for a late 2000s low budget survival horror, you could pick much worse.",
