            "review_text": "Beyond Eyes is about a blind girl looking for her best friend, a cat. The most successful part of the game is how it conveys her blindness. Often she’ll hear something ahead, and from her limited experience she’ll think it’s one thing, but when she gets close it turns out to be something else. At one point what she thinks is a fountain turns out to be a drain pipe, or what she thinks is scary birds turns out to be cuddly hens. At the start her frames of reference come from the environment she grew up in. But over the course of the game you see her learn what the world is really like through experience.  The animations are superb, as the girl gropes and feels her way through the world, and the art direction is wonderful. Other parts of the game like the voices and music are merely good. They do the job, but are a bit blunt. It’s the same with the sound design. I don’t think a blind person will be able to play this, as many of the queues a blind person uses to navigate the world aren’t here. This is generally a problem with games, as sound designers only tend to aim for movie realism, and never true realism. If you have sight you might not think about it, but you can hear how big a room is, and you can learn to hear where objects are by subtle wind sounds or echo location. I’m ok with Beyond Eyes lacking these things, because no games has those, not even blind games.  The girl walks slow, which gives the game a slow pace. This felt appropriate, as the environments are quite detailed, and it’d be easy to miss things if it was faster. The story follows a reasonably good dramatic curve, with a few scares, and moments of joy and wonder. How it wrapped up made the journey feel worth it. A strong payoff will always give the whole experience a rosy tint, and that's definitely the case here. It’s not a long game, but because of the deliberate simplicity of the story it’s the right length. I couldn’t ask for more.",

            "review_text": "This was a charming little tale about a blind girl on an adventure to find her only friend, an orange tabby. Along the way, she ends up meeting an actual human girl, and they become friends.  ...and that is pretty much all there is to this tale besides the message to move on and live your life despite sad and/or tragic events that change the path you are on.  The graphics themselves were beautiful watercolor art which opened up as you encounter and experience things.   The controls were simple. You basically just walk around interacting with a few items along the way.  There are 10 achievements, which I personally wont bother trying to complete. Why? Because you slow walk everywhere, and I just dont have the patience to ever play this game again. It was a nice experience, and I get that you walk slowly because you are blind, but that also doesn't make for an amazing experience repeated to try and find everything.   Overall, I liked the game, but I also found it to be a tad boring as well. Still, the game basically weighed in at about two hours, so just at the point where I was starting to get tired of it, I reached the end. Perfect length for this game.  As much as there are some negatives regarding pacing though, I thought the journey itself was worth taking. I'd give it 7 butterflies floating around a path of enlightenment out of 10 possible.",

Pros +Amazing Atmosphere, I think they did a great job of showing the player what it would be like to be blind. +Visuals are good, the water colored scenery fits really well with the story. +The music does a great job of setting the tone  Cons -The character is very slow, which most of the time is fine, it fits with the story and character, but becomes excruciating if you go the wrong way or in some levels have to double back. -Too short in my opinion for a $15 game, it only took me about 2 hours to finish the story and nothing extra is opened up by doing so(at least not that I am aware of) -There are 10 achievements for this game, one of which is for completing the game. The others, however, are hidden achievements and the lack of mobility does not make me want to go back in and explore every corner of the game to attempt to unlock the remaining 9 achievements.   Despite my griping, I really like this game, but it isn't something that I can recommend someone pay $15 for, it just isn't worth it. Buy it on sale if you are really interested.",

Cons:  Everything else that I would put down to poor design decisions by developers.  It's a pretty lame story, but I don't down-rate for bad stories. Basically, you play a blind girl walking around to find a cat she used to play with that has disappeared.   The world around is a blank canvas that gets colored in as you walk around. There are some cool effects where things get painted when you're further away, like if there is a sound from afar, such as a bell ringing or a babbling brook. Sometimes the girl will hear something and think it's one thing, only to find it is another as she walks closer -- like misinterpreting the sound of a lawn mower for a car.  Anyway, the primary negative aspect of the game that cannot be ignored and ruins the game:   The girl moves sooooo sloooooowlyyyy ...",

That said, it has beautiful visuals. The way the world paints itself as you move along and listen to passing fauna is well-done. The sounds of the game, from the trickle of water to the clucking of chickens goes a long way to painting the world as a real place. The developer has clearly put alot of work into the world, and it shows.  I cannot honestly recommend this as a game at £9.99, but if it's on a sale or you wish to support these evocative indie games, go for it.",

Or maybe someone just let a hose open? The only way to figure that our is by exploring. I guess for a real blind person it would be kind of the same.  At the end of the game I was starting to wonder if she had the colours of her surrounding right. Everything was lush and green, it is spring so it is possible, but it could also be gray, a completly poluted area or something else.  The game makes you think about these smalest things and more.

One point against the game, however, is the apparently poor surround sound implementation. Playing with 7.1 surround, it feels like the sound is designed for extremely basic stereo or even mono channel setups; I experienced trouble detecting which direction sounds were coming from. Very curious decision, and missed opportunity, for a game following a blind protagonist.",

If you think you will like this just because it is story drivin and it beautiful and an adventure game that this will be your jam in a sense. I wave caution to you because there are some frustrating parts of this game. My biggest upset about this game are the bounding boxes on everything. You hit something and because of how the character controller works and now slow you move you spend 5 seconds moving off of a wall instead of 1 second and that really adds up when this game is about finding walls!!! It is something that needs fixed and maybe the dev just didn't ever run into the walls that they made. also personally a little feature that would not mess up game play or even change it would probably help it some is a little button to get a slight jog going. Rae's walk is way too slow personally when you're running from something and it just isnt fun walking away from danger in my opinion. There is only 2 cons with this game, bounding boxes and character controller and for each of those there are about 500 pros. Pick this game up if you want to have your eyes melt out of your face from the pure beauty of this game. You won't regret it!",

            "review_text": "I think my copy might be broken. There doesn't seem to be any game here, I just walked for about an hour and did pretty much nothing.  No but seriously, huge props for making a child control like a tank stuck in mud. I didn't think that was possible.    No, but being actually serious, I get it. They wanted to do something different. But this is not how you do it. Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons did something like this very well. It told a story without a single word of dialogue, it built characters, it had a unique mechanic, it was beautiful, and most of all it was fun. This is basically just a walking simulator, and that's all I can say about it. But to make it worse, it's not even a good one.  Hear me out here. If you're in it for the story, there's next to none. And what few bits there are don't make any sense. For some reason when you're playing with your friends a tree explodes and blinds you (and only you). It also doesn't burn you or anything, it just somehow completely blinds you. Already that's a pretty lousy story, and it only gets worse from there. Not going to go into details in case you do decide to play the game.  But say it's not about the story, say it's about the art. Fine. It's not ugly, but it's not amazing either. There's plenty of much better looking games out there. Hell, if you just want to look at pretty things, a museum or art gallery will serve you much better. Although even if the art was stunning, you'd have to drudge through the level incredibly slowly to reveal it all before you can even see it, and even then, you can only partially reveal most of it.  And the only other thing is the gameplay, which there isn't any. You just walk slower than you've ever walked in any other game. There's no way to walk faster. And while normally walking simulators are bad enough, you can't even see where you're going. So more often than not you'll end up walking into a dead end or bumping into a bush that you haven't revealed yet. Then you have to do the walk of shame back through the area you've already discovered, and boy, is it the longest walk you've ever done, because again, you walk incredibly slow.  Some of the 'objectives' also require you to go several minutes out of your way and backtrack. The only thing that could have made walking slowly worse is walking slowly through areas you've already been through. The only reason I can think of to make the player do this is to pad out time. In some cases, it's not pretty, it's not necessary, and it's not fun. It's just a two minute walk out of your way and a two minute walk back just for the sake of making the game longer.   So should you get it? No, absolutely not. Say what you will, tell me I can't appreciate 'art', tell me I only like games where you're constantly shooting things. Reality is, there is no game here, it's a chore. Even if it was all artsy fartsy, it wouldn't be any less so if you could at least walk at a decent pace. It's just a shameless way of trying to pad out the game and make it feel longer than it really is, and shame on the developer for putting length over enjoyment.  If you want a game that does this type of thing well, go play Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons. It did all the things this game tries to do but better, and there's some actually gameplay there.",

The game mechanics and controls are simple, the gameplay is easy to follow, the visuals are beautiful, and this is a feels trip from beginning to end.  Calling this game a 'walking simulator' is not far off the mark. Aside from the occasional interaction with a ball or stile or bread, all you do in this game is navigate the big, ever-changing, and sometimes frightening world. As a result, the controls are very simple: WASD, space bar, escape, and mouse. That's it, that's all you need.  Simple controls are helpful, though, because at times it's easy to get turned around lose your way entirely. There were a few times that I really needed to concentrate to figure out where I need to be going, and how I should get there given all the new incoming information about the environment. But that's the beauty of the gameplay here: simple to learn, but difficult to master.  Getting turned around isn't all that bad though. The art style, and watching the world form and change around you, are wonderful experiences in and of themselves. Beyond Eyes looks very much like a children's storybook, with the playful watercolor art and the short blurbs of text that pop up sometimes. I was especially impressed with how sounds are visualized, and how environment color changed to portray Rae's emotions.  The colored indications of Rae's feelings, however, did not prepare me for the emotions this game had in store. For all its bright, cheery colors, this is a very sad game-- even heartbreaking at times. I will admit it, I cried twice playing this. The sadness, though, and the way it reaches out and touches you are incredible. Not many games are able to accomplish this, in my experience.  Taking everything into account-- the simplicity, the gameplay, the visuals, and the emotions-- I most definitely recommend this game. It's short, very well done, and an experience that will not soon be forgotten. Well done, Tiger and Squid! I hope to see more of what you come out with someday.",

But then I started playing it, and that's when it all fell apart...  This is a very soft recommendation. If you're genuinly curious about this game, or you got it from a Humble Bundle, then you owe the game a playthrough. It's not a great game, or even, in my opinion, a good game, but it is interesting enough to try.  My biggest issue stems from the games central idea. Since you're playing as a blind girl, you're unable to perceive anything in the game world unless it's making a sound, or it's directly in front of you. This encourages exploration, and since Rae seems to have a pretty good memory, she can remember just about everything about where she has already been. It's a lot like dealing with the Fog of War in an RTS, but from a more personal perspective.  The downside is that you often don't realize you're walking into a dead end until a wall or other obstruction appears right in front of you. This leads to a lot of frustrated wandering. You spend a decent chunk of the game hugging a wall or fence, looking for the gate into a new area, or backtracking because once you realize you've just spent two minutes going the wrong way.  And that's when my other major gripe with the game pops up. It's one thing to have to backtrack, but having to do it over and over with Raes sluggish walking speed. I haven't wanted a run button this bad since Gone Home.  The obvious counterpoint to these gripes is that the game is making an ernest attempt at replicating the experience of navigating an unfamiliar environment while blind; an effort that is both successful and admirable, yet seriously damages the overall gameplay. Maybe there just isn't a good way to gamify blindness.  But even after managing to endure the gameplay issues, there's still not a whole lot to praise. There's a simple story with a final emotional payoff that is both underwelming and predicable. Replay value is almost completely non-existant; two or three hours is all you need to really need to see everything.",

I experienced everything the game had to offer in 3 hours, and that was taking my time, however I feel like this was the right length for the game as it doesn't overstay its welcome and in some respects makes the story more powerful. Gives an interesting insight into aspects of what it is like to be blind, but I don't want to say anything more as I don't want to spoil it.",

            "review_text": "Beyond eyes tells the story, in third person, of a little girl, lonely and blind, looking for the only friend she's ever had: a cat that used to visit her and play with her. The landscape is drawn bit by bit, as it is discovered by the blind player through the touch, the smell, and the hearing. Soft pastel colors emphazise that what is on the screen is the written imagination behind the heroin's perceptions... and not necessarily the reality. Exploring the world about expands the understanding of the scene and let the story progress, but also gives rise to surprises: certain things are not what they appear, and desires can further cloud the perceptions.  The game has a slow rythm: with both eyes disabled, it is impossible to run, and even walking is riskier than for persons with able eyes. For the love of her cat friend, Rae sets out to a journey where she must battle her handicap, face her frustration, her fears, and accept the limits of her perception. The player shares her journey of initiation.  This is a sensitive and poetic tale of rare quality: one of those few games which, while telling you a story, also deliver a strong emotional experience. Don't be shy: cry at the end if you feel the need to!",

After I realized that, it became more fun to watch the world unfold in front of her. It was a beautiful game with a simple yet poignant story that will resonate with anyone who has loved a pet. The soundtrack is also nice, with a mellow piano that matches the soothing watercolor art.",
