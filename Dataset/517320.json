Traverse through a miriad of increasingly challenging locations as you try to stop the world from ending. Accompanied by an amazing soundtrack, gungirl and gundude must fight their way through whatever is left of the human race.  This game was the most solid game available for absolutely 0 bucks in 2010. As a long term follower of the dev's productions, this is by far one of the most successful releases ever and should be experienced by anyone.  Highly reccomended and i really hope this blows up enough to warrant a 3rd part :D",
