            "review_text": "While people complain that the Elder Scroll games can be quite bland and you play an expressionless psychopath mass murdering your way to the top of society, Oblivion is a sterling example of one of my favourite things about PC gaming - mods. I have hundreds from total conversions to one that adds little street cats that wander around looking cute. Oblivion really captures the DIY aspect of PC gaming I love in a shiny giant studio package, allowing me to change almost anything i don't like about vanilla. Unlike console people, to merely review and make judgements based on vanilla is to miss the beauty of PC gaming. It's that kind of community that keeps an aging game fresh interesting and addictive.  As far as the extras in the GOTY go, whether you care about player houses shapes much of the DLC, Mehrune's Razor quest is a large dungeon, nothing mind blowing if you play with Lost Spires mod, but some very shiny loot. The Knights of the Nine was a fairly straight-forward quest, would call it a good DLC rather than an expansion pack as such. However although you have to seriously stab someone at the end, at least some of the quests have variety in what you have to do a bit.   However Shivering Isles makes this edition worth your money imo. It adds some much needed oddness to the game, the kind of thing where you pause to think 'wtf is that?' as some creature shuffles or leaps towards you. Without getting into the whole 'which elder scrolls is best', one thing i felt was Oblivion and Skyrim settled with standard pseudo-medieval europe fantasy world, whereas Morrowind felt quite alien, but with it's own culture to be read about and discovered. Shivering Isles brings that to Oblivion. The books are a delight, and it's nice to experience a daedric realm aside from the Deadlands (which while fun, never felt like a place people lived). All in all and bearing in mind what i said about the still quite vital mod community, I totally recommend you buy this game.",

            "review_text": "First of all, if your question is 'Should I buy this game, period?', my answer is simply: Yes. If your question is 'Should I buy this game, or skyrim?' the answer's a bit more complex. I would not say either one is better, but they're two different tastes, like vanilla and chocolate.  In this case, I would say Oblivion is the vanilla. If you're looking for a straight-up, classic medieval fantasy, Oblivion might be more your thing than Skyrim, which is 'themed' around the viking-style Nords. Likewise, Oblivion has the default fantasy setting of castles and forests and rolling green plains, where Skyrim is, again, Nordic themed, and focused mostly on mountains and snow. Because of that, and some differences in art styles, Skyrim and Oblivion look very different, to the point where I would almost say that might be the deciding factor in which game is right for you. Skyrim is very much a modern game, with fairly realistic art, and that includes the recent trend of realistic games to be primarily brown and gray. Oblivion, on the other hand, is vibrant and colorful, and perhaps a bit stylized. If you are longing for a colorful first person fantasy game, Oblivion is for you (if you're looking for a sidescroller, I'd recommend Trine). If you've been wading through the Real-Is-Brown trend, the sheer vibrance of Oblivion can be a real breath of fresh air.  As for gameplay, the two games are relatively similar. I personally prefer the spellcasting setup in Oblivion over that in Skyrim - in Oblivion, you equip spells in their own slot, rather than in a hand (which could instead be holding a weapon), whereas Skyrim just treats spells like a sword that has to be put in one of your hands. Speaking of which, you cannot dual wield in this game. If you want to play a classic sword-and-shield knight, this particular difference in mechanics is more or less irrelevant, except that it's easier in Oblivion to cast the occasional healing spell. Furthermore, Oblivion offers a much greater degree of freedom in spellcasting than Skyrim. You can create your own spells by adding effects and designating whether the spell is a projectile, area of effect, etc. Enchanting and Alchemy are slightly more complex than in Skyrim, as well. If you like playing spellcasters, I'd say Oblivion is probably a better choice than Skyrim, which has you simply pick from pre-determined spells, and has a far more limited alchemy and enchanting system.  The biggest mechanical difference is the level up system. Without a doubt, Skyrim's level up system is more user friendly and intuitive. It might be a little more friendly to those who want to play these games casually, where Oblivion requires a little more care, planning, and effort. In Skyrim, you level up your skills as you use them, and after you've increased any combination of skills by a certain amount, you can go up a character level (on the spot, even). When you do, you increase one of your three stats (yes, only three: health, mana, stamina), and pick a talent tree to put a talent point in, which gives you bonuses - with different talent slots unlocking as you raise the respective skill. In Oblivion it is completely different. For one thing, you have several stats, each tied to three skills. The number of times you level any combination of skills attached to a given stat affects how much you could POTENTIALLY increase that stat by when you level up (and if you dont' get those +5s, you will find that the game swiftly outlevels you). By the way, you only level up when you raise ten points in any combination of your class's seven major skills, and only when you sleep. Skyrim has no classes, and therefore no major skills. This makes Skyrim's character-building system a little bit more freeform, as you can, if you want, change directions as you go, if you decide you don't like a particular aspect. Oblivion allows you to create a custom class, but you're basically stuck with that choice after you finish the tutorial. In short, Skyrim has a simpler, more intuitive, more fluid leveling dynamic, good for building your character as you go according to what feels natural, while Oblivion might be better for those who like to plan or min-max, and requires a bit more thinking ahead.  I should also mention that on certain computer systems, the music in this game may not work. It certainly doesn't work on my system, but otherwise the game runs just fine. From what I understand this is an issue with the CODECs and may be related to Windows 7.   One other thing I think is important to mention is that this game, despite being a fantasy, is surprisingly arachniphobe friendly. As someone with arachniphobia, I find it hard to deal with how ubiquitous giant spiders are in fantasy games. Skyrim's spiders are particularly horrifying. But Oblivion has no (true) spiders at all. It does have the Spider Daedra, which are essentially spider-centaurs, but I didn't find them particularly phobia-triggering. They're also very rare outside of the oblivion gates, so you won't often find yourself being jumped by one unexpectedly. If you are an arachniphobe looking for a fantasy game, I HIGHLY recommend Oblivion, especially if you're comparing it to Skyrim.    Also, this game has Martin Septim. That's reason enough to buy it.",

            "review_text": "I played Skyrim before Oblivion, but still feels Oblivion has much to impress me.  After I saved Kvatch, people started calling me 'Hero of Kvatch'.  After the Bruma Battle, a statue of my character was built beside the city gate, which was generated based on my weapon and armors instead of using a pre-set one.  After the main quest line, all the guards hail me as Champion of Cyrodill when I pass by.  After I became head of a guild, I recieve unique benefits like a real man in charge.  After I became Grand Champion of the Arena, there is an adoring fan who wants to worship the ground I walk.  All these details make me feel like that I am really living in the world and making a difference. I am really changing my place in the age of chaos through hard battle and honest work.  Instead, in Skyrim, guards still call me a sneak thief after I saved Skyrim from dragons. Nobody on Solstheim recognizes me even after I saved their asses from Miraak. I helped a Jarl to reclaim his throne but all I got afterwards is 'You are not as dumb as you look'.  Bethesda, WTF?  ============================================================  pros: +Not bad graphic as a game in 2006.  +Despite some strange looking NPCs and their strange chit-chats, Cyrodill is a much better place than Skyrim, considering climate, city scale, politeness of the guards, etc. +The Woold Elves are so cute. +The Shocking Oblivion Gates. +Elder Scrolls music never fails to impress. +Magic crafting. College of Winterhold looks like a bunch of rookies in comparison. +Newspaper about the quests you have done. I don't know why they cancel this in Skyrim. +Shivering Isle is really something you should not miss.  cons: -Bug. Bug never changes. -Poor motion design. Takes some getting used to. -Awkward NPC chatting systems. Mother and daughter greet each other like strangers, have some random talk, say goodbye, and then immediately greet each other again. -Useless followers. -Dungeons are like f**king labyrinths and have little to offer other than common monsters and meaningless random loots. No related quests. No background info. I can see why Bethesda hired experienced level designers to construct dungeons in Skyrim. -It ruined my life like Skyrim did.",

            "review_text": "A definite must-buy for a fan of The Elder Scrolls series. 'Ermagerd Skyrim is better Oblivion sucks cus graphics!!!11! You're just an Oblivion fanboy!11!!!'. Well no.  I first started playing The Elder Scrolls series a few years back, when Skyrim first came out because of all the hype. Reason why it shows a ridiculously low number of Skyrim playtime hours on my Steam profile would be that I didn't get the Steam version as I didn't have a Steam account then. I finished the entire main storyline, finished all the DLC, 90% of all sidequests and explored almost 80% of the dungeons in Skyrim.  Now, I only got Oblivion after much insistence by a few of my friends. At first, I was very turned off by the bad graphics and combat system. I compared it a lot with Skyrim, but I tried to look past the graphics. It was then I got really surprised. Funnily enough, after playing Oblivion for awhile, I like it better than Skyrim. I appreciate and get attached to the characters in Oblivion more than the characters in Skyrim.   Maybe it's because the character development in Skyrim pale in comparison? Or maybe it is because they hardly (almost never) kill off companions in Skyrim. In Oblivion, a lot of the main characters of the side quests    even the main quest    get killed off, and you cannot simply ressurect them using console    like if you accidentally kill off Lydia in Skyrim. Face it, everyone does that   , because their death is crucial in that plot.   I like the change of pace in Oblivion compared to the rest of the games I have played so far, because you are not the main hero here. You are just a Blade, assisting the next Emperor to take over the throne and stop Mehrunes Dagon. You do not get to do the final blow to the villian, you do not get to be 'hero' at the end of the main storyline. Because someone else close to you will do it for you. And trust me, you will get this feeling of emptiness for a very long time after that.  The soundtrack is really beautiful here, although it may make you feel lonely especially when you are exploring the wilderness. The horses actually make a satisfying galloping sound, although they are not as ridiculous in climbing vertical walls.  If one were to compare Skyrim and Oblivion, I would say they are both incomparable. It's like comparing an apple and an orange. They are similar, but you cannot directly compare them both. If you are looking for something different, and something more story-based, and a f*ck ton of plot twists, go for Oblivion. But if you are more of the graphics, modern-day sandbox game which follows a linear plot, go for Skyrim instead.   Overall, I enjoy this installment, will definitely put in more hours in this game.",

            "review_text": "90% of my time spent playing was: duplicating poisoned apples, placing them in guard barracks, and watching guards slowly die  11/10 would buy horse armor  tl;dr: It may follow Bethesda's formula of open-world enjoyment, but this one (and Morrowind) doesn't hold your hand. It has enough RPG elements to make one playthrough of the game different from another. Combat and bugs are aplenty, but the quests and varied map make up for those shortcomings.   9/10  I first played this game back when I was 13. This was the first Elder Scrolls game that I was subject to (I was slightly too young to be interested in Morrowind at the timeit was released). I had never played a game that allowed for such open-ended exploration and freedom. This blew my mind when I first played and it seemed like there was always something new to find out in the world. As a kid obsessed with this new experience, much of the flaws never really surfaced.  Fast forward 10 years. For nostalgia's sake, I take another trip down memory lane. It isn't as fantastic as I remember it (but nothing is as good as the first time). The exploration is still the best part of this game (as it is with all Bethesda games), but the problem is, once you've seen everything, a game can get old quick when it relies heavily on exploration. This is the problem with all future Bethesda games (but that's a conversation for another time). The quests are what elevate Oblivion. There are still some fetch quests, but I think those are few and far between in this game. If there are fetch quests, they dress them up and throw in plenty of twists to make it interesting. The best part is there are tons of quests in this game. Reliving those, or trying out new ways to complete them made this second playthrough incredibly enjoyable. Oh, and do yourself a favor and play through the best DLC/expansion Bethesda has ever made. Shivering Isles was so diverse and included so much content that I feel like I still haven't done everything to do there.   Downsides: Bugs, no real controller support, potato faces.",

Oblivion was my very first introduction to the Elder Scrolls and I enjoyed the game so very much from start to finish. The sense of immersion along with the well balanced gameplay and epic storyline was quite enjoyable for a roleplaying enthusiast like me. This title is so chock full of adventure and combat that it will keep you busy for hour upon hour which will eventually compile into weeks and months before you realize it. Graphically, you have to remember that this title was released quite a few years ago, it pales in comparison to some of todays RPG's but even so I found the basic game to be quite beautiful with a uniqueness of it own that completely fits the fantasy world and story that it places you in. I said that graphically 'it pales in comparison to some of todays titles' but I think this game still looks as good if not better than alot of the current roleplaying games available...this title was ahead of it's time and the work that the developers put into it definitely shows. Of course, as with many of Bethesdas RPG's, after you finish the basic game the first time you have the ability to modify the game to your liking for many more playthroughs by way of the Oblivion Nexus. You can mod the game from the start but I as well as others agree that playing through the base untouched game the first time is a wise thing to do. This title is simply fantastic and is highly recommended!!!",

            "review_text": "Right after its release, Oblivion divided people on many patterns. I've heard friends who felt it was not a big step above Morrowind. In other words, they were disappointed with how little was changed. They wanted more of new game design decisions, and Oblivion, following all basic guidelines of the previous games, was not such a huge leap forward that someone expected. At the same time there were others, who felt lost and enraged with the amount of obscurities in compare with their beloved TES 3. 'Conspiracy of simplification', some people called new trends, shown in the Oblivion. 'They trading deep, thoughtful gameplay for WOW moments!'...  It's been almost a decade since then. We saw Skyrim, Fallout 3 &amp; 4, many other open-world RPG and wanna-be RPG titles. While it's a common thought that Oblivion was not a bad game, the main question is - Is it worth something now? If you haven't played it before, by what conditions would you like that game and will be motivated to actually play it? Simply put - should you buy it now?  In the line of Elder Scrolls games, despite common lore, every volume is quite unique. Morrowind goes with oriental motives, religious cults and huge, comprehensive and insane magic sandbox. Skyrim is about Nords, snows, dragons and their powers, and really huge open world to explore. Really, like hundreds of hours of adventuring...  TES IV has its own focus - the Central province of Empire, being overrun with hordes of demons from the lower plane called Oblivion. The problems of central governance and very dramatic main storyline, with all adventuring and other freeride activities pushed away in favor of highly orchestrated quests. The Empire in perils, the one and only Emperor dead, along with all legal heirs... The high dosage of Pathos seems unavoidable. Is it a bad thing? No. The Oblivion still much more free-play oriented than, say, Dragon Age Origins or Witcher. And those 'orchestrated' quests are not giving the feeling of moving in the narrow intestines of scenario where you're more of the observer rather than actual actor. Some of those quests will be memorized as perfect examples of quest-writing and performing. You know, the gold book of RPG quests, bonfires, fanfares, all that stuff...  Sure, the creators of Oblivion dropped many of the gameplay mechanics that Morrowind fans were proud of. On other hand, we've got a world much more alive and reflecting with your actions, than it was before. All those things that were simply nailed to the one place in Morrowind, including god-like beings like Vivec - in Oblivion have not only a place to be, but the duties to perform and some logic to praise or disregard the course of current events in the game plot. Although... less static doesn't necessarily means good dynamics. It is safe to say that the world of Oblivion is not that capable for providing player with adventures as Skyrim. Besides main story line and some of fraction quests (like assassins or Daedric quest lines), some of us could even find that Oblivion is somewhat dull. On the contrary, the world of Skyrim is noticeably less colourful, so there certainly will be others, who like Oblivion More than Skyrim...  You know that? You should try it for yourself. Placing yourself in the sabatons of the knight-by-fortune, saving the Empire from fires of Abyss...  My mark will be 7.1/10. I'd give it more, would there not been all those useless pricy dlc's like shiny 'armored' skin for horses. They downgraded my overall expression out of the game, but it is still a nice piece of work, well-worth of attention from any RPG fan.",

When playing you will see alot of NPC's, some NPC's will only be talkable during quests or guilds. Or they might have a quest or just be people that are there to fill the area. There is about four guilds in the game, following the Thieves Guild, Dark Brotherhood, Mage's College/Mage's Guild, and ofcourse Fighters Guild.  The story off the Dark Brotherhood is that you have just been spyed on by a man when you have killed a innocent, he will tell you to kill a man (Not saying due to spoilers) when you have done so you are invited. But to the guild you will be nothing but just a new member. You do quests to advance and aqually mean something in the guild.  The Thieves Guild is similiar to the Dark Brotherhood in the sneaking aspect. But you can't kill people as that gives you a boun ty. The story follows: You have been thrown in jail, the people off the thieves guild take you as a criminal now and has given you a chance to join the group. You start off as a normal low ranked member, not being of much use, but it will change when you become a higher rank.   The story of the Mage's Guild is self explanatory. Mage's Against some evil people. This guild is the most boring one in my opinion, but if you're playing a mage I recommend this guild.   The Fighter's Guild, this one is very mixed for me... it didn't have much for a story except for stop that guy, do that, stop that guy. But was still very interesting and had alot of fun moments.   Overall, the Elder Scrolls: Oblivion in the ends turns out as a great adventure game with alot off challenge and alot of fun, you will spend about possibly even 90 hours trying to complete everything or less if you just wanna finish the story, but then you're just missing out off the actual game. As the game is very good and still has quite decent graphics compared to some games. I give this game a 9.5 out of 10 due to how it was made and how much there is to do. The graphics aren't the greatest but are actually quite decent. This game is very recommended from me if you like adventure and RPG mashed togheter.",

            "review_text": "The first time i played this game was somewhere around 2009 or 10 for PS3, after being hooked on Fallout 3 i thought that this game was going to be just as awesome and time consuming, but it was difficult for me to get hooked as i did not understand the lore to this game much. Fast-forward to 2011 when i got my copy of Skyrim i found that i was able to play an Elder Scrolls game, and i found it to be one of the best games i have ever played, and went well over the 300 hours of gameplay estimated for the game.  After playing Skyrim i chose to play Oblivion again, and i loved it. After having a bit of knowledge on the lore and the way Elder Scrolls games worked i found that the world of Tamriel became a more interesting, and definitely beautiful place, but i never did complete Oblivion until today on the PC. (18/10/2014)  I can tell that Cyrodiil is very much based on England, or countries alike; with the vast and beautiful forests to explore to the rolling fields and meadows of County Skingrad and The West Weald, i felt like i had taken a journey back in time to the days of Albion, where tales of magic, dragons and heros were told in regular supply. The experience of delving into the past in Ancient Ayleid Ruins was exciting and jumpy, and all the more rewarding once you come out with a good bit of loot, gold, and tons of welkynd stones... maybe too many, but aside from the visuals and personal experience, i found the story to be very much like the fantasy stories of gold, and i cannot believe i never took the time to follow the main storyline before, but alas, i have now completed it.  There are a few letdowns however, one being the lack of variety in voices for NPCs, and the very static movement of the animations for the game. I admit this was made back in 2005 and was BGS' second major 3D game, i think, but it made the game quite immersion breaking at times, and nobody would want to be pulled out of this amazing world. Speaking of voice acting, there were times where the voice acting for certain characters were not on par with the voice acting of the regular NPCs, and i found this to be disappointing with the amount of quality this game tries to bring to the table.  Graphically this game has a very artistic feel to it, for where it wants to be as realistic as possible, it still has a sense of handmade effort in the visuals that gives what you see value, because the world of Cyrodiil is like looking at a painting: a true masterpiece.  So my final rating for this game is a very strong 9.2/10  Before entering the world of Tamriel, i recommend looking up on some of the lore, i would recommend ShoddyCast on YouTube with it's lore series, but this game, and Skyrim, are a definite purchase.",

And so begins one of the most popular RPGs of all time. A fantastic example of what a modding community can accomplish,  The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion  has nearly unanimous love amongst the community, even after 10 years since its release. If you've played any of the Elder Scrolls before, from  Arena  all the way to  Skyrim , then you'll probably already know what's in store but if you're new to the series, then you absolutely owe it to yourself to play this as soon as possible.  Though still a flawed gem, this revolutionised the role-playing genre back in the day and marked the bittersweet end of the isometric days of  Baldur's Gate  and its ilk. A huge step up and a breath of fresh air in a saturated market, the success of  Oblivion  was primarily due to its ability to perfectly combine so many elements together while still producing a coherent, easily accessible and, above all, extremely enjoyable game.   'You. I've seen you before. Let me see your face.  You are the one from my dreams.  Then the stars were right and this is the day.'   Threatened by total annihilation from the other-worldly Daedra, you alone are tasked to stand against the horrors that continue to pour into the world and save Cyrodiil from those that seek to destroy it. Ultimately, the world's fate is in your hands to do with as you please.  Personally featuring my favourite campaign of the  TES  series, the huge range of activities, quests, factions and general shenanigans you can get up to is remarkable. While the implicit morality system tends to favour reasonably good characters, the grand campaign and truly epic final battle more than makes up for it. There's little else that has come close to achieving the experience of that final battle in the Imperial City. Plus Jeremy Soule's superb soundtrack will have you engrossed all the way through. Good times.   Technically, this game is a marvel and will run excellently on nearly all rigs.  Oblivion  has certainly dated, that's for sure, and if you're more interested in more recent games, then please be warned because, yes.. even back in 2006, PC games were filled with atrocious console UIs. Thankfully, there are plenty of mods and unofficial patches available, as well as graphical overhauls and ENBs to bring it up to looking its true and (breath-taking) best. The 'Bethesda bugs' and the amusing A.I. remain the same, but almost have a charm to them now and, though noticeable, don't detract from your experience.  Gameplay is a mixed bag. For its time, it's great and offered a great depth and freedom to the various playstyles the open-world/blank slate roleplaying encourages. Simply put, this has some fantastic dungeons. Yet by today's standards, if you're playing this for the first time, it will most likely frustrate you with supposedly clunky and repetitive combat. It certainly can also take some time to adapt and navigate the menus and inventory system. Though you've probably been hounded to play this classic, if you don't enjoy this sort of thing, then I cannot recommend it. However, if you do consider yourself to enjoy the fantasy/RPG genre, then this is the essential addition to your collection.   It doesn't matter whether  The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion  is better or worse, or more or less watered-down than  Skyrim ,  Morrowind  or even  Online.  At the end of the day, it simply is a great game in its own right.   So what are you waiting for? Stop right there, criminal scum and hit play already.",

            "review_text": "Oblivion is probably feeling a bit forlorn these days, with most of the hardcore crowd sticking to Morrowind and most of everyone else abandoning it for Skyrim. And it's no great mystery why this is the case, but I still think Oblivion is a game that shouldn't be overlooked, with the proper precautions taken.  It's no secret that Oblivion is an RPG full of problems. The most grievous one in my opinion is the level scaling system, which scales basically everything in the game from dungeon loot and quest rewards to enemy equipment, gradually making the game more tedious as you level up until you finally find yourself face to face with a highway bandit who somehow found a full suit of Daedric armor and you just have to wonder where your decisions went so wrong that led you to this moment. The persuasion system is literally a joke, in which you just play a little wheel minigame where you dish out your best knock knock jokes (or boasts, if they're into that) until they have no choice but to tell you everything they know so that you'll leave them alone. I still don't know what the Speech stat even does, because as far as I'm aware you can start working on your standup routine fresh out of prison and never suffer any penalty. There's very little feeling of character specialization, and there's no reason at all to not be the leader of every guild in the game, the owner of your own order of knights, and more because even if you want to play the game as a stealthy archer or something the game all but forces you to become a combat focused character where your major choice boils down to 'magic or hitting things' and there are no guilds that are strictly designed around a certain playstyle, making each of them less interesting for the people who did specialize towards one guild. The main storyline in general is fairly boring, and even the Shivering Isles expansion is fairly dull, to the point that I didn't even think that the collective content of it as a whole was as amusing as the single little Sheogorath quest in the base game.  The good thing is that thanks to the magic of mods, most of Oblivion's faults can be fixed, and when you can play through the game without being constantly reminded of its flaws there's a lot to like, instead happily focusing on preventing the game from crashing whenever it feels like it. While it certainly has its fair share of tedious quests, Oblivion has a surprising amount of actually interesting content. I found myself enjoying more sidequests than not, and there are a few that are up there with my favorite quests in any RPG, like a certain Dark Brotherhood quest. Most of the 'organized' quests like the guilds (for reference, play the Dark Brotherhood if you want to have fun, play the Thieves Guild if you want to pretend to have fun, play the Mages Guild if you hate fun, and play the Fighters Guild if you really hate goblins) and main story fall flat and feel like they build up too quickly for an ultimately weak payoff, but the real good stuff is in the one-shot stories you'll find in the towns and wilderness. Another perk of Oblivion is that it's home to the outstanding mod Nehrim: At Fate's Edge, which is a massive total-conversion mod that is arguably better than any of the Elder Scrolls games.  Ultimately, Oblivion isn't an amazing game, but it can be pretty great or at least good after a bit of tweaking. As a special note, if you buy the deluxe edition I would personally recommend just disabling every minor DLC instead of bothering to grab all their unofficial patches, because as a whole I found them majorly disappointing in that almost all of them were just cheap excuses to get you things for free, like a house that has an ability that lets you skip one of the longest sidequests in the game or a house that has everything you could ever need for alchemy or any other of like 5 houses, quickly leaving you desperate for a quest that doesn't end with a deed to a mansion after being overloaded with a dozen quests you don't know the first thing about the moment you leave the prison. Even Knights of the Nine, the not-expansion expansion, is fairly short and not really interesting at all, unless you just think the armor reward looks cool. Ideally I'd recommend just not buying the deluxe edition at all, since the regular game of the year edition comes with the two worthwhile bits of content, but since there doesn't seem to be any way to buy the rest of the dlcs separate if you're a completionist you may as well jump for it. But overall I think Oblivion is definitely worth playing, especially since it goes on sale fairly often.",

Because skyrim was so racist towards elves and khajits which made me hate the nords more.

Instead of counting on the stones, You chose your perks and name your own class.  And the fact that you can 'talk' to NPCs made the game more alive. Like you can tell them jokes, Bribe them, Boast, etc it felt like the NPCs in the game are a living things. Instead of accessories or an 'atmosphere'.

I therefore enchanted my self an OP bow early that does a ton of damage spread over a large radius(it one hits pretty much everything in a certain radius from the guy that was hit with the arrow). However I like the fact that you can cast spells whilst having other weapons equipped unlike in skyrim.  Guilds: This will be an oblivion to skyrim comparison thieves guild is better in oblivion- you steal more, get better rewards and it is less of the dungeon crawling. dark brotherhood I would say is equal. In oblivion it is long but entertaining whereas skyrim it is short but sweet mages guild is better thsn the college of winterhold. The recommendations can be tedious but the rest is a lot better. fighters guild is do not know about as I have not done it. Arena is better than the s**t bards college  DLC: This will be a skyrim to oblivion comparison Oblivion has a lot of useless dlc that pretty much equals hearthfire so i will only be talking about Knights of the nine, dawnguard, shivering isles and dragonborn. Shivering Isles is amazing and the best part of oblivion. It at the very least equals dragonborn another amazing dlc. Knights of the nine looks great whereas I did not much like dawnguard.  Main Quest: Oblivion main story was a better plot the skyrim and felt more important. However the oblivion gates mechanic and the dragons both got boring. I enjoyed playing through both of them a lot and to be honest if you enjoyed either of them you will like the other.  Overall: If you like skyrim do not be afraid to try oblivion. It might be tough to get used to but it is definitely on par with skyrim and if produced tomorrow would probably be a better game. ",

If you like Bethesda RPG's and are tired of the over simplification of their games, Oblivion is a nice medium between 'I have no idea what I'm doing in this game(Morrowind)' and 'I wish the game didn't hold my hand so much(Skyrim)'. I have beaten every quest in the game twice now so I am pretty comfortable in my viewpoint. When it came out it was a 9/10 in 2006... by todays standards I'm gonna give it a 7.5/10.  My only compaint is that the environment scaling to the characters level completely destroys any sense of looting and novelty when exploring things. For instance, in Morrowind you may encounter a cave populated by extremely high level enemies at level 1. 99% of people are gonna die and just not come back until a higher level. But if you are intuitive, or can just really design a good build maybe you make it past them. And find some insane Daedric artifact or weapon, something ACTUALLY WORTHWHILE. I wish TES would go back to that type of system, it added such a huge element of surprise to the game and made exploring things actually worthwhile.",

I still haven't gotten around to completing EVERY quest in the game, but I got most of it.  In Oblivion, you start out in a prison cell after a small monologue and character creator. An NPC mocks your choice of race and then the emporer himself comes to your cell. The Septim line is being attacked by an unknown force, and he is escaping the city to survive. Destiny destiny destiny, tutorial, class picking, bla bla bla... and then you finally are put into the world. When you first step out, you'll either say one of two things: 'Wow! This is amazing!' Or: 'Wow! These graphics suck!' Oblivion is a dated classic, and doesn't look as good as games do now. But, if you can look past that, you can really find a gem.  Like many RPGs, they either leave much to be desired or a years worth of adventure. The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is full of places to go and things to do. But, this is where some problems arise. With so much to do leaves a lot to be desired, and some quests end up being your typical dungeon crawler. But the idea of having an open world to explore and do whatever you want is overwhelming and terrific. Every 1 in 3 quests though did have a great amount of originality to it, from stealing a prized gem in the imperial castle itself or going to another dimension to stop a man from destroying the world. It really is amazing if you can look past the typical dungeon quests that get boring after a while.  Finally, the gameplay; the meat of the review. Oblivion's leveling is complicated at best and very hard to do sometimes. It tends to be stressful, and quite honestly, dull. Skyrim had done it much better. Swordplay tends to be just slashing around a sword hoping to hit. Magic is cool, though, as if you can get into the mages college, you can customize your spells. Archery takes precision and is pretty fun to try out. The difficulty slider in the options menu is literally just 'How many times do you want to hit this guy until he goes down?' There is no reason whatsoever to put it up, just keep it 1/4 up to make it better. Fighting is fun in general, TL:DR.  In the end, Oblivion is fun. It's really hard to critique this without coming across as a fan. But, I am a big fan of RPGs and you should take this review in the eyes of one. I can't see a huge FPS fan getting this and having as much fun as I did. This is really only a game for people who are not new to RPGs in general and like the idea of them. This game is a great game though, and I do fully recommend it from the eyes of an RPG fan.  ",

            "review_text": "I know that Steam says (at the time of writing this review) that I only have about 21.5 hours on record, but I assure you that I put hundreds of hours into this game on my Xbox 360 before I got my PC. This game is undoubtedly one of my favorite and most likely one of the greatest games to ever be released. I can almost guarantee that you will like this game if you are an Open-World RPG fan. Let's open this game up and take a look inside one of the best isntallments in the Elder Scrolls Series.   Gameplay: The most important element in a video game is the gameplay, and the Elder Scrolls IV has that down to a science. Sure, this game does a bit more hand-holding compared to its predecessors, which is completely undeniable. This game also has a simplified dialogue system and, in my opinion, terrible voice acting, but do not let these cons detract from the great game this is.   Oblivion, being one of the only titles in the series to not be named after its main setting, offers amazing exploration and rewards it nicely, especially for you dungeon-crawlers. With the vast and open world of Cyrodiil at your fingertips, you can explore and discover some of the most beautiful and historical ruins, forts, hamlets, cities, castles, rivers, lakes, caves, mines, and many other dungeonesque sites. you won't just find enemies at these sites, though. Like I said before, exploration is rewarded.  As for a replay-value: you will never play this game the same way twice. Sure, with the lack of 'radiant' quests that are present in Skyrim (Oblivion's 'sequel') you basically know what's going to happen in any given quest you've already done, but you don't have to approach these quests the same way you did before. Perhaps in one playthrough you are a battlemage that wields a Dwarven axe whilst sending a barrage of lightning bolts towards your enemies, but in another playthrough you are an assassin that wields an Elven bow whilst sending a barrage of poisoned arrows towards your foes. With the class system in this game, you won't ever have to be the same character twice. I have had several different characters in this game, and each time I have played I experienced everything differently than before.  Combat: The combat in Oblivion makes so much more sense than it did in Morrowind (Oblivion's 'prequel') in which you would swing your weapon into an enemies face and it wouldn't even phase them, but here in Oblivion, every hit is rewarded with a blade covered in blood and a scream from the other end of your sword. While the game doesn't do a very good job of challenging the player in combat as long as they follow the course provided for them, but there are places in this in which you will be absolutely brutalized if you go in unprepared. This is where exploring and being prepared come into play.   Bows and arrows, swords, daggers, magic staves, maces, axes, or your own bloody fists are all at your disposal when it comes to combat in this game. Each comes with its own positive and its own negative, but the more experienced you become with your weapon of choice, the more rewarding your trudge through the cons will be. Choosing a weapon choice and becoming proficient with it is always a great choice, but, of course, you are not forced to do this. If you want to use swords and axes at the beginning and then halfway through decide that you want to use bows and arrows, go for it! You won't be held to the weapons you use in the beginning, it will just make the journey a bit more difficult on your way to mastering your new weapon type.  Finally for combat, there is the Arena. This is perhaps one of the most popular features in ES4, and rightfully so. At any point, you can enter the Arena, join the team and fight for glory and money in a gladiator style throwdown. This is a great way to not only get yourself into the swing of things when it comes to combat, but it can also help you level up pretty quickly near the beginning of the game; be careful though, because the further you get in the Arena, the more challenging the enemies become!  Graphics: I won't lie to you, the graphics in this game aren't the best, though at the time of its release (I remember very well) these graphics were some of the best I had ever seen! Without the proper mods, this game makes everyone look like they have a potato-face and makes blood look like a powdery substance rather than a liquid. Fret not, though, like I said, mods are a beautiful thing when it comes to this game. I downloaded a buttload of mods and now my Oblivion looks almost as good as Skyrim. Don't worry, graphics have no effect on the gameplay anyways, unless graphics are very important to you.  Immersion: As is the tradition when it comes to Elder Scrolls titles, immersion is a key feature in Oblivion. From the small details like being able to pick a random magical gem off its stand in a random tomb or being able to go for a stroll and pick flowers and mushrooms, to being able to commit murder on any unsuspecting NPC for no good reason and then going to prison because of your vile actions. Your actions have consequences, and almost everything you do will have an effect on how the world treats and sees you.  Have a beer, read a book, eat dinner, spend the night in a hotel, buy a horse, ride that horse to another town and repeat the process. Any small action you can think of, you can most likely do it (no f@pping guys...)  Performance: Considering this game came out almost 11 years ago, I'm pretty sure everyone on here will be able to run this game on at least the lowest settings and still hit 60 fps, but who knows.  -Ratings- Gameplay: 9/10 Combat: 8/10 Graphics: 10/10 (At the time of its release) Immersion: 9/10 Performance: 10/10  =Conclusion= Definitely give this game a chance. If you're still on the edge of whether or not you want to buy it, watch some gameplay on Youtube, or look for some streams on Twitch, you are guaranteed to find something online somewhere that allows you to get a glimpse of the amazing game that Oblivion truly is.",

One thing that I found can't quite be fixed with mods is the horrid level scaling. Sure there are a few combat and level scaling overhauls and what not but they're a bit of a pain to install and get working and they tend to either not fix the problem or make it worse by making basic enemies like bandits tough as ♥♥♥♥ from the start.

With many other 'open world' RPG's you are still pressed to follow the main quest line and, once it's done, you're done and left with little else to do. This adds to how immersive the game is and, above all else, stresses the 'Role-playing' aspect of 'Role-Playing Game'. So what the combat isn't as impressive as that of Dragon Age? You don't have to min-max in Oblivion: you just play and enjoy the beautiful vistas of Cyrodill. I would also like to add that there are literally thousands of mods that improve upon every problem present with the game and even improve on the good aspects. (P.S. There's no Workshop support, so you have to use a mod manager and stuff. I personally suggest OBMM (Oblivion Mod Manager) and the use of the Nexus mods webpage.)

It's not quite at the levels of Morrowind's landscape, but what sets it ahead is the combat. Morrowind's combat SUCKS. You don't always hit, and there is no mandatory blocking, and half the time you try to cast a spell under destruction or conjuration or whatever level 50, it just won't work. Oblivion's combat is the perfect middle ground between Skyrim's fantasy stereotype cardboard cut-out combat controlls and Morrowind's 5 year old who can barley lift a sword. It's just the right amout of difficult. Also worth note, is how you will never ever ever ever ever ever ever finish this game. There's too much stuff to get sidetracked with, and not in a bad way. You'll be walking along, and see, say... Some ruins. So you go to check them out in hopes of finding a weapon or a potion or something, then, you see a door. Five years later, your hero finally reamerges from the caves with a new weapon and 20 more levels. Also, the main theme is the best idderation in this game. 10/10 Recomended for everyone",

Wonderful, personally find it better than Skyrim, because to me, Skyrim you are paying for graphics, Oblivion you are paying for a game. Oblivion can be very easily modded, but seeming that it doesn't have a steam workshop, it makes the process generally longer, but, as Gaben had once said ; ' Worth the Wait. ' Oblivion will more than likely keep you occupied for easily 200-300 hours, and is very easily replayable, because of the different races, and some perks that some races get. The map of Oblivion is easy to read, when Skyrim's map was rather awkward to read, because of the stupid angle. Oblivion's storyline is rather a small portion of the game, when there is guilds, e.g Fighters Guild, Thieves guild. Some of the quests in Oblivion can be quite lengthy, and some even require you to be a certain level to complete/start a quest. The combat system of Oblivion is rather simple, where Skyrim you couldn't use a spell with a sword and shield for example, where as in Oblivion, you can use a unlocking spell, and you can just rush into a building, loot, and complete a mission for a guild.  I highly reccommend Oblivion, and would definately choose it over Skyrim.",

Well, it also has it's main quest story line (optional), and a number of optional side stories.  Oblivion is, in essence, the entire scope of an MMORPG, but without all the other people. As a singleplayer game, it's great since you can play it offline when your WoW/EQ/etc. server is down, or when your internet is on the fritz, etc. On top of that, you can expect all sorts of awesome things you can't do in normal MMORPGs because of the problems that arise.  For instance, you can steal from nearly any character, but beware the repurcussions if you're caught!  With Oblivion you are the master of your own adventure. Oblivion is just the location where that adventure takes place.",

There are costly upgrades for the lair that are more that arent just cosmetic, a prisoner in a cage (if you have contracted vampirism you can feed off him, also the lair has a vampirism purging chamber for ridding yourself of the disease), pimped out coffin replacing bed, an actual minion who you send out to kill people and every 4 days he brings you loot, there are a couple other neat little things. in the lair there are several hidden sacks of jewels and cash dotted around, i made my knight of the nines companion wait and stand in the lobby as my minion attacks the punching bag in his room for hours and whenever i make an dangerous outing i make him occampany me, placing all your belongings in your room and planning items for a specific quest is a much more satisfying mechanic than having a swiss army knife of tools on you for every single situation that could come your way weighing you down so you dont feel like you should pick up or search for loot that isnt particularly valuable at the level you are playing at. lastly, i spent hours moving props around and arranging them to create my home and it feels super satisfying to be out on a quest and to be able to pick up an item that looks nice and place it in your room even if its super heavy and has no value. whereas before there was nowhere to put it. i found myself questing for cash to buy upgrades for my death cave and during those quests looking for shiny jewels and trinkets to put on my desk.   vile lair dlc feels like stardew valley in a dirty cave full of skulls and virtual satan.",

For every other Skyrim player who has been curious about this game, here are some differences I have found between the games so far:  -The Controls: while moving around and dialogue options are the same as Skyrim, some of the controls are switched around. E to jump, SPACE to interact; F to sheath/unsheath weapons, R to switch from first and third person view. Also, you can't sprint, but you can switch between walking and running using the SHIFT and CAPS LOCK keys. -Lockpicking: Not only does it have a different name (security), but the format is also different and can be hard to get used to. Once you understand how it works, it's a lot easier than Skyrim's guess and check system, as long as you have sound because your success kinda depends on that. There's also an auto-solve feature, where there is a chance that you will still fail. -Speech: Increasing this skill means talking to NPCs and playing a mini-game that is complicated at first, but not too bad once you get the hang of it, or bribing them. -Race Perks: For the most part, they are the same as Skyrim, just not as many, for example Khajiit don't have the claw perk, but they are still good thieves. -Standing Stones: They don't exist in Oblivion. However, you do get to choose a birth sign in the beginning, which is almost the same, but you can't change it later on. -Leveling Up: In Skyrim, your character gets xp from every skill that levels up. In Oblivion, only leveling up in a specific set of skills will give your character xp. You also have to sleep in a bed to do this, and your enemies get stronger as you level up, so working on other skills is highly reccommended. -Equipment: It wears down the more you use it, and can break if you're not careful. You can also fix it by using a hammer, as long as you have one in your inventory, at any time. Keep in mind that the hammer only has so many uses before it breaks, so you may have to get a new one. -Interactions with NPCs: Expect to get a lot more comments about your character's race within this game. Make friends with them with conversations, and they will tell more information on topics. You can even have conversations with the guards. -Pickpocketing: It still counts if you look inside an NPCs inventory but don't take anything.  Of course, there are more differences that I haven't noticed yet, as I am still exploring the world, but there are plenty of places on the Internet if you want to see a good comparison of the games. I was personally intimidated by the differences I found online, but I can tell you that I do not regret my decision to buy this awesome game.",

('Turn the difficulty up u nub' is a common answer to this claim.) Oblivion isn't meant to thrill you with loud explosions, sword wielding zombie like creatures, and fire breathing dragons. I feel Oblivion is meant to entrance you. To make you look at the scenery and say 'Wow' and proceed to screenshot it. The quests as well. Skyrim quests bore me with the same 'Go get this' or 'Go kill this' while Oblivions are incredibly deep. The Knights of the Nine DLC for example left me with some incredible new gear that looks fantastic, and memories. Sadly, many others do not agree with me, as you do you.",

The DLC is a joke, though, but as a fan I still wanted to get everything Oblivion so I opted in for the GOTY edition.

People seem to only take a glance at it before calling it 'outdated', simply because of its 'outdated' graphics. This is total bogus, because 1: the graphics were actually great at the time of release, especially for such a massive game and 2: since when do graphics make a game anyway? In many ways, I prefer Oblivion to Skyrim. The world of Cyrodiil feels much more rich than Skyrim's does a lot of the time, the cities feel varied and are filled with awesome people, and the quests feel less contrived or boring, and more diverse and interesting. Don't get me wrong, I love Skyrim, but I'd recommend for more people who have avoided Oblivion to play it, and I'm 99.99% sure you won't regret it.",

If you come from playing Skyrim, beware: this game is not the same as Skyrim, and you should have reasonable expectations of Oblivion. I have had a few friends dislike the game because 'it doesn't have smithing?! how am I supposed to get good armor?! This game sucks!' In my opinion the reason that some people don't like this game is because they can't appreciate it on its own, and think that it's not good because it doesn't have some of the features that Skyrim does.

If you don't want to download from third party sites, you can discount this point.) - Customization of characters, from their bone structure (though a character's height is race locked) , to their hair cut, to the spells they cast, and the skills they employ. Patrick Stewart will even ask your birth sign, which isn't entirely out of the ordinary for those in regular contact with him, but I digress. - Big world. Contrary to what many Morrowind fans say (and I'm one of them), the main cities, while sharing some characteristics do tend to stand out with their own architecture and style. - There's no radiant ai or refilling quests (without mods that is...) but you probably won't be able to complete all of them anyway in under a hundred hours of playtime. One quest or one dungeon crawl can take over an hour. Quests are largely self-defined as in Morrowind. - Elder Scrolls lore, but that's largely subjective and a matter of personal taste. - Bigger, less stupidly easy-to-navigate dungeons than Skyrim. - Combat feels more fluid than Skyrim. But there's no way natively to unnock your arrows after you've taken aim. - Spells can be used while using two handed weapons and shields. - No dual weilding.  Cons:  - No dual weilding. - A quest system that gives less in the way of directions than morrowind, and as a result relies heavily on quest markers. - Ugly, potato-faced npcs and pcs if you aren't good at character customization. - Spell creation is less complex than morrowind or daggerfall, but still better than the abortion of magic in Skyrim. And better balanced into the bargain. So again, not really a con as much as a comparison. - DLC that if checked when you play the game, will inundate you with messages as soon as you're free of the tutoria... er, beginning sequence. - A game that almost requires mods to be playable for most isn't what most would call a good game. Yet I've rarely enjoyed a game for long that didn't allow for modding of vanilla. Subjective. - Mods aren't always professional quality, and can destroy either your game or your computer if you load too many or the wrong ones. - No proper beards.

            "review_text": "Oblivion and Skyrim (plus all add-ons) are the best RPG's i have ever played! They are so vast that you can spend 100 hours on one character and if you start a new character you can have a completely different game/experience! The thing i love about these games are the fact it is not linear at all (as i find with a lot of RPG's), so you can basically do what you want when you want and at what pace you want.  Also, the graphics for Oblivion and in particular Skyrim are fantastic as alot of RPG's sacrifice graphics for gameplay/storyline etc. however both these titles have the best of both!  The only minor fault with this game (and this is me just being objective) is that when you get past a certain point/level with your character it can be a little bit to easy even when set to high difficulty taking some of the challange away.   If you like the RPG genre then you will love The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion &amp; Skyrim and i would highly recomend this to anyone!  I rate both these 9/10 (one of the best games i have EVER played)",

            "review_text": "In the spirit of brevity: I completely recommend this game to anyone with a computer capable of running it.   Even if you never fight a single enemy or finish a quest, this game is beautiful and you could spend hours just exploring , talking to NPCs, running with the wildlife, mixing potions, or just cloudwatching.  However, I suggest that you do attempt every quest and engage a large number of enemies. The fighting and enemy AI mechanics for the game, while sometimes quirky, make combat , exploring, and even buying and selling items an utter delight. There is a difficulty selection scale that can be changed anytime, and console commands, enabled through the use of the tilde key (~), allow one to activate invincibility, set any attribute to the desired value, and even instantly kill any/all enemies in the area, thus ensuring that players of any and all skills levels can complete the game 100% with ease, or set overwhelming odds for themselves to triumph over, all at a whim and quick set of keystrokes.  The game is fully voice acted, so there is considerable emersion, and dialouge can be enhanced through the use of mods (found on Oblivion Nexus mods site). Actually, there is a mod for just about everything the game offers, and, if you care to put in the time to get the mods running, or write your own, the game can be made into a practical sandbox. (Even adult mods are available, if that is what you desire.)  The music is gorgeous, as are the scenic graphics. Battle music is invigorating and explortion music is inspire. Easy listening and living tunes fill the towns, and more sombre melodies fill the plains of Oblivion.  In conclusion, I can't recommend this game enough; every gategory is either extremely well crafted, or readily improved through the addition of mods, and an avid gamer could easily clock hundreds of hours on this game, with mods or without.  It is worth every penny, even when not on sale, but, I believe it is actually on sale for $5 or less at the time of this posting, so, if you're on the ropes about this game, give a try now, and if you're one out of millions who finds it to not be worth it, you won't be out any more than burger and coke at McDonalds would cost you.

            "review_text": "Decided to re-write my review seeing as my original review was pretty basic and was written almost three years ago (in 10 days time at the time of writing) There is a TL;DR at the end with summarises the pros and cons of the game.  So, The Elder Scrolls: IV Oblivion starts out you creating your character inside a prison cell, which in Elder Scrolls games has almost become a tradition. You are able to choose between any of the races in the previous installment: Morrowind. Character creation is good, you're given the option to choose your race, gender, looks, hair, hair colour and eye colour among other things. After that you take control of your character inside the Imperial City Prision where in the cell across from you, a Dunmer will give a brief paragraph or two depending on your race. I would almost call him racist seeing as how the only race he 'likes' are fellow Dunmer. After that the Emperor, Uriel Septim VII, Who is voiced by Patrick Stewart is brung to your cell as there is a secret route out of the City which is in your cell. You tag along with the Emperor and his body guards through this passage as you are attacked by assasins who are part of a Daedric cult called the Mythic Dawn who have assassinated all of the heirs and Uriel is next. Eventually Uriel, and two of his body guards are slain, and you are given the Amulet of Kings and are told to stop Mehrunes Dagon from entering Cryodiil. You exit through the sewers and once that's done you are free do to as you please.   You can do a multitude of things after the tutorial, wether it's join the Arena in the Imperial City as a combatant, Join up with the Mage's or Fighter's guild, join the Dark brotherhood etc.  The plot begins with you taking the Amulet of Kings to the city of Chorrol and finding the head of the blades, then you must visit the destroyed City of Kvatch and find Martin who is unknowingly the illegimate child of Uriel Septim and as such, is the last surviving heir. The plot then focuses around stopping the Daedra invading Cyrodiil and crowning Martin as the Emporer. Eventually Mehrunes Dagon mangages to get into Cyrodiil and Martin must sacrifce himself to force him out and seal the bound between Oblivion and Nirn.   Side quests are fun and intresting, often yeilding gold and unique items as rewards as is the same of the faction quests. The Dark Brotherhood has my favorite quest in the entire game, and probably the entire series, in which you enter a house filled with people who believe there is a chest full of gold somewhere in the house, There are multiple ways of killing them all and the best one is gradually convincing people to split up and then silently disposing of them, until you and two others remain, you can convice them to turn on eachother, and then you can kill off the survivor. Doing this will even earn you a bonus.   Pros  +Large open world, free to do whatever you want +Quests are intresting and are unique +Able to enchant your weapons, armour, clothing etc. +Able to make your own spells +Lots of dungeons and Oblivion Gates to explore +NPC's feel alive and react to your presence as the Hero of Kvatch +Mods, which fix most if not all the problems +Game looks great, even if it is 10 years old. +Shivering Isles DLC is amazing.  Cons -Monsters and NPC's are leveled meaning that certian items are impossible to acquire at lower levels and that there aren't any 'easy' fights -NPC's have potato's for faces, but mods can fix this. -Unique items are leveled but they don't scale, meaning if you get an enchanted sword at level 5, it won't scale the damage and enchantments with you, meaning soon it will be useless. Again mods fix this. -Horse Armour DLC (In no way shape or form necessary)  TL;DR Quests are intresting and fun, there's much to do, Shivering Isles is great, mods fix like 99% of the game's problems, Good RPG elements like atributes, Major and Minor skills. NPC's aren't the greatest, Horse Armour DLC exists, game still looks good today. Replay value is amazing. I could go on but I won't  Easily 10/10, so much better than Skyrim",

Well Oblivion is a fuly open world, meaning if you see a mountain in the backdrop, you can climb it. It's not just a painting. The sense of exploration is equisite, no other developer has ever managed to quite hit it for me.  That said, the gameplay is nowhere near as polished as in, say, Skyrim.

I spent the most amount of time in Morrowind, but Oblivion will always hold a special place in my heart.

I enjoy the different approaches you can use to get what you want. You can bash your way in, sneak around, cast charm spells, etc. A few downsides to this game: tons of bugs and gliches (the Unofficial Oblivion Patch is a must addon), spotty and repetative voice acting, a lack of NPCs travelling the roads (it takes place in the capital of Tamriel, there should be a good ammount of traffic). Overall though, the pluses outweigh the negatives. If you like open-world games then this is one to add to your collection.",

The enemies scaled slightly better than they did in Marrowind, and the hit detection was 1000 times better, but the inability to get quest without warming up to a person was a little crippling in the early game and I often found myself running from enemies I punched to death in Skyrim. Arrows wieghing did little to help, and the fact that going over the wieght limit stops you in your tracks was very saddening. Still I had more fun with this game than I did Marrowind, and from what of the story quest I did complete, it looks to be promising in the future quest. I recomend getting this game, just don't use console commands to set your level to 100, enemies will take 3 years to kill if you do.",

            "review_text": "I played this game because I did not own a pc that could run Skyrim very well, and now I'm only playing Oblivion because I never beat it. This game was groundbreaking for its time and while some stuff was done much better than in Skyrim, there was a lot more that was simply awful.  Some Good Stuff: -The dialogue in this game is absolutely amazing. While there are very few voice actors, each npc seems to have their own unique dialogue, and that dialogue is rarely boring. Skyrim's dialogue got boring and seemed recycled at times. -Spellmaking in this game is awsome. Being able to make my own spells that can have a bunch of different effects is so cool and I seriously wish that they kept this for Skyrim. -Cyrodiil is a wonderful and varied area to explore. You've got snowy mountains to the north, marshes and rivers to the south, and coasts to the west, and if that's not enough, you can go to Oblivion where everything is on fire. It stayed fresh as opposed to Skyrim's all snow and mountains. -The quests were interesting and always fun to do, not much more to say about it because I don't want to potentially spoil anything, but you won't spend a lot of time playing the main quest at first. -While not intentional, the uncanny potato faces and character creation is hilarious. I made a new guy recently after taking a long break and I decided to not care if my guy looked normal or not, so I made a Nord with a concave face, huge puffy lips, a tiny nose that almost touches his lips, and tiny eyes that are far apart, I created a monster and he is wonderful.  The Bad Stuff: -The combat in this game is way too floaty. I never feel like I'm hitting what I'm swinging my sword at. -Having to chose a class with major skills being your only way of leveling up is very restricting. While choosing those major skills can vary due to custom classes, players are still stuck to leveling up by only increasing those major skills, which can hurt you in the long run because you may need some of those other skills later on (my new uses swords, heavy armor, and shields but I've lately started increasing alteration to use those lockpicking spells). Being limited to only 7 major skills for leveling up does more harm than good, as it also restricts your level cap, and I don't think players should be so heavily restricted in rpgs, especially when it comes to character building. -Increasing those major skills is broken in so many ways. Being a mage simply felt much more rewarding in Skyrim because your magic skills increasing almost as quickly as everything else. Mages are dealt a bad hand in Oblivion because all useful magic skills except alteration increase so slowly players might as well dump gold on training their other skills. I wanted to grind my sneak the other night, I go into a tavern, face a corner, and push auto-run while crouched and then left to take a dump and get something to eat. I started with 14 sneak, by the end of it, I was at 80. -Lockpicking in this game is possibly the thing I hate the most about this game. It makes almost no sense and new players are punished for not being able to react faster than humanly possible and end up losing all of their lockpicks. I ended up just going into console commands to open chests and doors that weren't very easy before remembering about the lockpicking spells. -Spells on the C button as a default. What? When I make a mage, I don't like using magical staves, just spells, so not being able to click to use spells really bugged me, but I may be alone on that one. However, duel-wielding spells in Skyrim opened up some possibilities. Have fire in one hand and ice in another to take out enemies that are stamina-reliant and fire/spark for magic users, and then there was the perk to make the spells even stronger by 2 of the same spell. -The Dark Brotherhood. Once you finish their questline, there is nothing left to do with them. No more contracts to kill people, nothing. After finishing the DB questline in Skyrim, you can get radiant quests to kill unnamed npc's. While doing just that gets boring, it is really great that you can go back and kill a man/woman if you need some gold or just need to increase your sneak or marksmanship. You don't get that in Oblivion, it just ends.  This game was fun while I played it before moving on to Skyrim, but after going back, I can't get over the glaring problems Oblivion has. If you can get it for cheap or simply want some nostalgia, get this game. If you haven't played it and don't the cons listed, then this game most likely isn't for you because once you notice these problems, they never go away. Hopefully it won't take too long for the dev team to remake this game on Skyrim's engine, that'd be the Oblivion worth buying.",

My excuse is I was aiming to play as much as I could of it to figure out why the hell people enjoy it so much, and I still have no ♥♥♥♥ing clue. I played the main quest, all of the DLC quests, a bunch of side quests including some guild stuff and did quite a bit of exploring.  This game is beyond boring.  - Literally 5 voice actors. - Zero effort for any sort of facial animation (or any other body animation for that matter). It's frighteningly awkward talking to people and having the camera just zoom up as close as possible to their face. - No outcome or punishment for anything. 'Oh, you can kill people, join a guild, rob a merchant, be any class you want, go to jail....' ....so what? What's the end goal? Nothing, there is rarely any reward for anything you choose to do. - Casting spells is brutal. Choosing them too. The whole UI is pretty terrible. - The story is awful. Or at least, it could be interesting, but even the good voice actors seem to fall asleep by it given their performances. The best quests were the funny ones that didn't take themselves seriously, such as this one you do for Sheogorath where you trick this one village and some others in the Shivering Isles expansion. - A mind-numbingly easy levelling system.  - Very poor variety in enemy encounters. (Most of them just run up and attack you and don't do anything unique or challenging.)  The biggest redeeming thing this game has though is the world is actually pretty nice to lose yourself in. It's fun to just walk around, discover an old cave or ruin, kill everything inside it, get some loot and keep going on your way. I can appreciate that. One problem is, there are literally 4 types of environments in this game. Hills/forest (which covers 95% of the map), the Oblivion gates (which all look identical), caves (again, all depressingly brown and identical) and ruins (very similar to caves, but nicer, especially the Ayleid ones). So everything becomes really boring, really fast.   The only other thing that I can say is appreciated is the availability of mods. While I only played with a couple, it's nice to know that the developers are so open about that kind of stuff.  In the end, I'd give this game a 2.5/10. I think it's pretty terrible game that is massively overhyped. One day I'll play Skyrim and see if it's any better, but from what I've seen, I highly doubt it.",

After beating the tar out of Skyrim for several hundred hours, I was fascinated by the Oblivion lore contained within the game. Having skipped over it from Morrowind (on the original Xbox), I wanted to play out the storyline for myself. I purchased and installed it, waiting to immerse myself in the story. Ehhh. Didn't happen. Post-Skyrim, this game was severely disappointing. I'm not saying it's a crap game by any standards, but once you've played the next in the series, the predecessor just doesn't cut it at all.     UPDATE 2016:  I've decided to give Oblivion another go 'round, mainly because friends who know something about modding have enlightened me that the clunky feeling I originally felt can be obviated through extensive modding. When I wrote the original 2 1/2 years ago, I had little to no experience with mods. So here's what I'm going to do: reinstall the game and play through the introduction again and formulate what else I don't like about it sans mods, then install all the mods that I have been recommended and try again and hopefully log a s***-ton of hours and give Bethesda the thumbs up that will surely make/break its reputation.  Yes, I now realize my original review left a lot to be desired aside from 'No, I didn't like it,' so here's why I didn't care for it the first go 'round from what I can recall.   What I didn't enjoy (prior): The either flat- or blobby-feeling facial textures of character creation, the huge open spaces with little to no vegetation with flat-seeming coloring, the character movement, the cartoonish feel to the menu interface, an overall clunky feeling that I found it impossible to separate from the contrasting crispness of Skyrim.  Given that even unmodded Skyrim was fairly beautiful and lush, I could not even get to the points of Oblivion that were supposed to be amazing, as mechanics and textures felt like such a step backwards, it was almost physically jarring to me.   What I did enjoy (prior): Patrick Stewart's voiceover. Sadly, that's kind of it.",

The world is huge and open, but repetitive environments and fast travel negate any enjoyment of exploration. Don't forget how ugly the vanilla game is, the guards who psychically know what you're doing, NPCs who change voices mid-conversation, the bland music, the guard who stole your freaking horse, and all the little bugs.  Sure, it's moddable. You might think it's easy to fix any problems with it, but getting several mods to actually work together requires so much messing around you'll probably waste your weekend converting OMODs, scanning readme novels, and experimenting with load orders and conflicts.

Upon creating a redguard character the memories came flooding back and I was on my way to completing the game once again. Despite my spending hours and hours on this game in my childhood, I continue to discover new areas and new quests which fill in my time with extreme splendour, showing just how vast this game is. In this timeless classic, gameplay is pleasurable and graphics, while dated, are still acceptable by today's standards. Among my favourite games, Oblivion does an incredible job of telling the story of Emporer Uriel Septim's assassination and subsequent opening of gates to Oblivion and the lengths to which the protagonist must go to prevent the complete destruction of Cyrodiil. Even after completing the main quests, players can immerse themselves in many terrific side quests which are sure to keep them busy for hours on end and fulfill the feelings of accomplishment upon every quest completion.  Oblivion has been one of my favourite games since I first played it when I was younger and continues to offer me a lot of joy 8 years on. I can not recommend this game enough, especially for those who enjoy open world, action RPG games.   9.5/10",

It is an open sandbox game, so you can do whatever you want, and don't have to follow the main story if that isn't your cup of tea.  The base game is now very dated visually, but there are a lot of mods to improve the graphical quality if you care about that sort of thing. Modding is one of the best bits of this game - there are tons of the things and they are pretty easy to find online. I would personally recommend the DarNified UI, which massively improves the usability of the GUI and HUD, the Qarl's Texture Pack, which massively improves the visuals, and the mod which colours the in-game map (I don't recall it's name). If you find that your inventory is always full and it's really annoying, there's also a carrying capacity mod that allows you to adjust how much you can carry.  Overall I would rate this game 9/10.",

However, with mods this game is still really stunning to look at. That might not sound like much; but consider this, Oblivion is almost ten years old! No game before it can be said to look modern.(sure mods are making that happen, but without them it is still decent)Or play like a modern game.   Every NPC has a job like a modern game, the quest are all voiced, and the world is totally open. The thing is this a game that modern games are still compared to. The only game older that gets this treatment is World of Warcraft, but thats very different. Getting many updates over the years. Oblivion didn't get such things. No, but we still compare it to everything else.   As for the game there isn't much to say. The story is my personal favorite of the series. Even the DLC Shivering Isles has a stronger story than both of Skyrim DLC did. I still perfer Skyrims game play and modded is a sight to behold, but Oblivion is prettier. More interesting, being that one third of the map is not artic wasteland. See this is where Oblivion is the oldest modern game. I can compare it toe to toe to its successor that took 5 years to make and with mods is probably the best looking game ever.   If there is a problem with Oblivion it's because of its age. Like how it has stutter(stutter remover mod works wonders), it runs rougher than a modern game, you need mods to make it 100% stable, the water looks terrible(check mods at Nexus and its fixed), and no Xbox conroller.   Really, think about it. Ten years before this was 1996. So do you compare map size/graphics/gameplay/ammount of content/story to say Mario 64 or Resident Evil. Funny how all you have to do is update graphics and you can keep a game going forever. Ah, now it sounds like I'm talking about World of Warcraft and LOTRO. Still for a non MMO this is the oldest modern game in my eyes, and still has an active modding community. Obviously you know you should buy it.",

The mod community is still running stong on tes nexus (and other places but thats the big one). THe thing about the modding community is that its been around for so long now that the 'cream' has had time to rise to the top. Whereas skyrim (which isnt nessecarily better but has improved graphics and gameplay) has had less time to have the 'cream' mods rise to the top.  Nevertheless the mod community is what makes this game great, not the game. The game alone, aka vanilla, is excellent and I would still recommend it. However, Bethesda gets too excited about their games and forgets to debug all of their content. Its cute, like watching a puppy smash his face into the food bowl and spilling kibble everywhere. There are UOPs (unofficial oblivion patches) for all of the content and it makes the game the way Bethesda wanted you to experience it. Outside of that youll lose yourself in an ocean of mods. So keep in mind the following about mods and the game itself:  Its a game, find time to play it and not just build it.   get quest award leveler mod (or something similiar that exists out there) if you are afraid to jump in and ruin getting an item scaled down to a low level thats amazing throughout the game.  ask questions in the community (perticularly about modding tools i.e. BOSS and wrye bash).  reddit.com/r/oblivion  is one such place as well as the bethesda forums and tes nexus forums. We love answering questions and we are a very inclusive bunch.  Its a medevil RPG with fantasy elements. Suspend your disbelief and roleplay a little bit. Swing from evil factions and the like to good stuff (or reverse) with some story you make up along the way. Or make multiple characters among the races.  dont horde stuff as the game will have a harder time balancing itself out when it has to load all of your junk.  the main quest picks up and REALLY starts grinding into you once you speak with the heir (not a spoiler, its just an event trigger in the game you should be aware of). Be a higher level (17 -25 I recommend) to fully enjoy that quest line and be prepared to focus on just that for a while.  the leveling system is quirky, put up with it and manipulate it to your whim.  Finally, this game is so customizable that I cant really say anything bad about it because I can be satisfied through another's work to add on to this game. Its a great game, buy it already.",

You sense something isn't right as the emporer himself strides through your cell with some gaurds. He clames to have seen you before, and you follow him in an attempt to escape. However, minutes later, he is assassinated by a mysterious cult. You must then escape.  Giant gates called Oblivion Doors have been appearing all over Cyrodiil. These gates allow evil beings to transport themselves to the real world and attack. After escaping from prison, you head to the city of Kvatch, which has fallen victim to one of these gates:the city has been sacked and many of its denizens have been slaughtered. However, as you liberate the city, you find a man named Martin. He is the emporers only heir, and he seems to have the key to defeating the Lord Mehrunes Dagon, who has created these portals.  Now proclaimed the Hero of Kvatch, you must attempt to stop this lord's evil plans. Cyrodiil is in your hands now.  First off, for the people who don't know, this game was the one preceeding Skyrim. I've asked people if they'd played this one, and they've replied 'OH, i thought Skyrim was the only one.' That's why part of this review will be dedicated to differences between Oblivion and Skyrim.  So basically you can do what you want. There are plenty of guilds to join, which give you missions to accomplish, new characters to meet, and exclusive gear. You can become and assassin, a thief, a warrior, or a mage and have a guild to back you up.   You can have any playstyle you choose. Want to go in stealthy? Go in with a large greatsword? Or kill your enemies with a spell? You choose. Adapt to each situation you are faced with, and use a combination of steel and magic to solve your problems. Become an outlaw or a do-gooder. Whatever you want.  Oblivion Gates are great challenges for you. They transport you into a realm resembling Hell, where you will fight deadly creatures. You must make your way up through a tower to claim a sigil stone, which destroys the gate. Though these are innovative and are challenging, they can be very annoying if you encounter one while doing something else.  For Skyrim players, there are some key differences. The leveling up in this game is more vague compared to Skyrim. You also choose a class to play as, such as the mage or the agent. You can also make your own class.  Combat if also different is well. Spells are single use only, and theres a slight cooldown until you can use it again (to use a heal spell you raise your hand to apply it, your hand falls for a second, and you raise it again, no duel wielding of any kind in this game.)   Overall this game is amazing. Buy it.",

I also like the magic which doesn't take up a slot on your hand (you can carry a shield or a bow and still use magic), there's a greater variety of spells and you can create your own.  The atmosphere overall seems more appealing to me but this is just an opinion.  On the other hand some of the game mechanics may feel outdated and frustrating if you've already played in Skyrim. Also, the locations are getting very repetitive and after some time you are sick of the caverns and mines.

Each time I've tried to start I've instead found myself modding it for hours on end over the course of several days before eventually getting distracted by something else and I 'forget' about it. I once spent two weeks modding the non-Steam version of Oblivion back in 2008. I still remember buying all the original DLCs from the official Bethesda site, including the infamous horse armor DLC, and then spending hours upon hours combing through the mod collections on Nexusmods to find all the best mods, from unofficial patches, to UI improvements, to graphics mods, to whole new content packs with their own dungeons or questlines. I still have all of those original files saved on my NAS, totalling 16GB, neatly organized by category, all these years later.  If you enjoy tinkering with mods, play-testing each one after install, troubleshooting mod compatibility issues, using/learning archaic and obscure third-party mod managers (BOSS, OBSE, OBMM, Wrye BASH, TES4Edit, etc.), optimizing the load order of each mod, learning new scripting languages, and generally not getting anything done because you waste all your time on modding a game instead of actually playing it, then Oblivion (or Skyrim) is the game for you.  10/10 - would start to play again and never finish, every time.

Additionally, the characters are very interesting (even though they have the same 8 potato faces) and are worth exhausting dialogue options for.

Skyrim was a fantastic game, but the whole dragon prophecy approach you can only do so much with (and dragon combat was kind of pathetic), and Oblivion feels a lot more creatively driven-- the oblivion gates are really neat and good areas to get some combat experience. I like that you can kind of take a lot of approaches in this, stealth feels just as powerful as all-out warrior combat where I felt rogues were underpowered in Skyrim. (The whole, shoot-arrow-and-cower-in-the-shadows approach could get a little tedious and became more than necessary as a rogue after things scaled enough) In Oblivion as a more stealth-oriented class, my movement speed allows me to dodge and bait enemy attacks and then strike after dodging the blow, and illusion spells combo wonderfully.  Also, you can choose main specs that affect your level, so leveling non-combat things doesn't completely screw you over. I remember my lockpick had gotten me high in level in Skyrim and I was fighting things that completely outgeared and outdamaged me because my  combat  levels were low, but in Oblivion their leveling system is more specific and you can avoid that problem easily. Though, the scaling is global and REAL, so expect to run into bandits with daedric weapons at some point. You'll probably be strong enough by then though, so it's just good gold if you can carry their stuff.  Overall, an awesome game in my opinion, lots of hours of gameplay and playing it lets you appreciate the plot of Skyrim a little bit more, personally experiencing the history that you were told about in Skyrim.   PROS: - A really awesome main story - Tons of gameplay hours that Bethesda games love to offer - Guild/faction playthroughs show an interesting perspective on Skyrim's same guild/factions - Balanced combat system - Narrowed-down leveling system kept me from fighting OP enemies  CONS: - Naturally the graphics are older and some races are not done any justice - The game tends to freeze, sometimes freezing the second I load up (this wasn't bad enough to be intrusive, but I did suck my teeth many a time) - You're going to hear the same like 5 voices for the entire game (with different dialogue ofc) - Sometimes item leveling ♥♥♥♥♥ you over-- you wander by chance to a place with a great item and it's forever superweak because you discovered it at a low level - Psychic guards, nuff said",

Even when you finish all the quests you still wont be bored . You be a fighter or a mage or you want to be a dark assasin or even a thief its up to you. There are 4 main guilds that you can focus is to become a master. You can either be a knigh or a powerful mage or maybe a marksman. It big contet is just amazing. It can drag you to 100 of hours and even more. New DLC's are good too. It has amazing story too. Magic weapons armos and spells are just amazing. But one little problem are the bugs in the world. Because its so huge its full of bugs too. Some times NPC's get bugged out. But overall the game is pretty amazing and worth a buy. You can sit on your horse and enjoy the cities from far away.

The dungeons have a limited number of room designs compared with the number of dungeons, so eventually you will start to recognize the room layouts as you enter them, but they give enough combinations so that the dungeons themselves are (mostly) unique combinations of the standardized parts.",

Usually its fighting about which one is the best one. Oldschool / hardcore gamers like to point out Arena or Morrowind, casual gamers love Skyrim. It is Oblivion though, which I am going to review now.  Oblivion had astonishing graphics when it came originally in 2006. Nowadays its very outdated, but the graphics mod still make it look good to this day! And this is for most of the Bethesda's games, thanks to their understading to the importance of good modding support. Modding can make a good game to great one.  Oblivion has pretty generic and cliche main storyline, but the side quests are where it is at it's best. Very interesting characters, lore and missions. Brotherhood of Dark, Glarthir's paranoia, mage stuck on dream world, man missing in a painting... Amazing guests and mods add even more of them. And not only quests, but bunch of weapons, redone (better and sharper) textures, better sound world etc.  Speaking of sound... Music is very, very good in the game, as it is in The Elder Scrolls games in general. Oblivion however has been stuck in my head as a best one. I love how easily you can add your own choice of music too and even for the right spots (battle music, wilderness music, dungeon music,...). It is such a wonderful feeling coming back to Oblivion once again, walking down the roads and finally coming in to Anvil or perhaps to Skingrad, listening relaxing soundtrack and just wondering around, talking to townsfolk. It is a fantastic feeling, especially if you hold that special place in your heart for Oblivion.  Scenery and cities are way better than in Skyrim, cities like Anvil, Imperial City and Cheydinhal actually are interesting and beautiful.  Books (if you like to read) are very interesting as well and can give you plenty of new information about quests or just lore in general.  Factions are mostly great, Dark Brotherhood especially. Thieves guild is pretty interesting too. Mage's guild was disappointing, as it was in Skyrim too. Fighters Guild was decent. There are other (minor) factions too, some joinable, some not.   Arena is a wonderful place to bet (and lose) some money or just fighting yourself. Imperial City - what a place.   Sure, animation can be pretty bad, technology outdated and it has plenty of bugs and crashes (as does every Bethesda game) - but if you can play with these flaws you might have a great time ahead. I know I've had.   Overall, its a great experience with flaws. It is not the most hardcore RPG, but not as casual as some of the others we have nowadays. There is a chance that you may or may not like the game. Give it a chance though.  91/100. Stop right there you criminal scum! Buy the game.",

So, this is my favorite Elder Scrolls game. My computer runs too slowly to run Skyrim with good graphics, so my settings make the game look like Oblivion anyway.

Gameplay wise: Fun, certainly feels like an elder scrolls game, with mods can become even more fun though combat does have the damage sponge feeling to it.

In Oblivion you choose a class and you make your play style based around that class or else you will do poorly, wheras skyrim you can be a thief weilding a warhammer and do great and have no trouble making it through the game. The best feature in any elderscrolls game is starting a new game and choosing a different class and seeing how insanely different the game is as that class. For example in arena (the first elder scrolls game) I played as a mage and did good, then I decided to start another playthrough as a warrior and the game felt like a completely different game. As a mage you constantly go to the mages guild to create spells and are constantly selling any non mage armor because you can't wear it, Then as a warrior you are constantly changing armor in the beginning like a hermit crab finding a new shell and trying to find the best weapon rather than save money up for spells.I may have trailed off, but my point still stands that oblivion still holds that feel of an elder scrolls game.",

It's obviously worth every penny, especially consdering the world of content you get for it's now low price. I'll inevitably compare this game with Skyrim, but the two are different enough that I can play both in a row without it feeling that repetitive. Unfortunately, repetition comes around in other ways. Knowing how to mod your game will obviously improve your experience considerably.  Pros: -All non-fetch quests are fun and varied -There is always something to do, mostly in the form of exploring the wilderness or the large cities, but also reading books and interior decorating of a home or making your own spells -Voice acting is well done, but could use more variety -The world is dripping with lore and immersion -The guild quests, especially the Dark Brotherhood, are some the most fun and engaging quest chains -There is almost always a powerful item to find, that can only be found by exploring extensively (eg. Amulet of Axes, Necklace of Swords, Ring of Perfection, etc.) which is lacking in Skyrim -You can literally kill almost anyone or anything you like - just for fun  Cons: -In vanilla, the levelling system is annoying. If you level up incorrectly (By not focusing the proper skills to use) the game gets harder as you level up - and it's difficult to control the skills you use, not to mention unfun. I used the Oblivion XP mod to get around this. -In vanilla, once you get to a certain point your character does not improve very much anymore. Since I only use swords, once I got blade to 100 I quickly felt bored and wanted to finish up the main quest despite the whole Shivering Isles being untouched. Oblivion XP and Uncapper mods fix this. -Combat is rather clunky and boring. There are power attacks, but apart from that and blocking there isn't much else to melee combat. Deadly Reflex mod fixes this. -Late game becomes too easy, even at 100% difficulty - if you know how the game works. The difficulty curve is annoying because I still haven't found a level that remains sufficiently challenging throughout the whole game. -Half the DLC is not worth getting. The only ones I got were Frostcrag Spire and Mehrune's Razor; everything else I simply got rid of. This makes it harder to choose between the two editions available.  Either way, Game of the Year edition is a steal and enough to satisfy any RPG fan. Some people may not like the clunky combat in favour of open world exploration, but since I love exploration, immersion and fantasy, this game remains one of my favourites to this day. ",

            "review_text": "I bought the Game of the Year Digital Deluxe edition, although I previously owned a physical copy of the game (I still have the map on my wall! :D)  The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion was my first introduction to the Elder Scrolls series in 2011, the year that Skyrim first surfaced. My computer wasn't good enough to run Skyrim so I tried to scratch that adventuring itch by picking up its predecessor - and that itch was more than scratched, believe me. In fact, even once I did upgrade my computer to the point that it could play Skyrim, I still found myself playing Oblivion more often.  Although it could be argued that Skyrim is the better game in many cases, Oblivion still has so much charm that any aspiring Elder Scrolls fan cannot afford to give it a miss.  PROS -   - Set in the continent of Cyrodiil, home of the Empire (before they all became ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in Skyrim), your character starts off life as a prisoner who has a fated encounter with the Emperor of Tamriel. That's when things get interesting for your character - when they ascend into the world from the sewers, they have an entire continent - and its attached DLC, should you have picked it up - to explore. The main quest is lengthy and enjoyable with many amazing characters and friends to make along the way, complete with a storyline I think Skyrim struggled to rival. The only problem I had with the main questline was that one quest you got to where you JUST HAD TO destroy like 8 overpowered Oblivion Gates just to get the different cities to join you. But that's only a minor inconvenience.  - The DLC (Especially the Shivering Isles) is creative and fantastic, adding tonnes more hours of gameplay if you take the time to explore everything. Knights of the Nine is also interesting (although perhaps a little short) and offers some sweet new gear, and the Mehrunes' Razor DLC adds the one Daedric Artefact that was not available originally by giving you a giant dungeon to crawl through for it - and guess what, IT ISN'T A TEDIOUS DUNGEON, IT'S ACTUALLY FUN!   - The replayability value is immense - I had about 40 characters for this game at one point, all of which I'd spent a considerable number of days on - in fact I probably spent more time playing this than I have Skyrim - and I know for a fact I've sunk thousands of hours into Skyrim by now. The main questline is only a tiny fraction of what this game has to offer - with in-depth side quests both small and large, all of which are rewarding and enriching in their own ways, add on tonnes of hours after the main questline is done and dusted.  - Character customization is pretty good if you know how to work it properly - changing skin tones on the beast races is a little complicated at first but once you know what you're doing it's pretty easy to get your character into anything you want it to be - the colour palettes aren't limited like they are in vanilla Skyrim. Heck, you can even give your nord blue skin, or your wood elf green skin. Flourescent pink hair is also an option - whatever floats your boat, buddy.  - A plethora of mods allows you to make Oblivion into anything you want - horse mods, custom races, armor and weapon mods, overhaul mods, texture overhauls - whatever you want to do with Oblivion, there's nine times out of ten going to be a mod for it. With the use of mods you can make your game unique from everyone else's, giving you a gaming experience nobody else can copy. Also the Unofficial Oblivion Patch is a good way to fix some aspects of the world that may not work for all players, although I've never needed this myself.  - Beautiful soundtrack that only makes the experience so much more enriching.  - Every dungeon is unique and offers different experiences - and I mean every dungeon.  CONS -   - Bugs and glitches for days, including some that are gamebreaking or can damage saves. I have lost characters because of these bugs, but luckily they are few and far between and I know the Unofficial Oblivion Patch fixes some of them. Usually these should not be an issue and sometimes the issues can be resolved using the Command Console yourself.   - Texturing is slightly poor in some areas (horses and player/npc faces just to name the two biggest eyesores), but there are plenty of mods to rectify this.  - Quests bug out and sometimes cannot be completed without the help of a Command Console (extremely annoying).   - AI is pretty good for its time but definitely has its flaws. Characters sometimes don't follow their schedules or can die beforehand, meaning that they don't turn up for related quests and such. (One example I remember is that I once sent my maid to move from one house to another - she never turned up at the second house and I literally never saw her again)  - Combat is kinda clunky but is easy to get used to, I wouldn't call this a major flaw. It's nothing fancy like Skyrim, incredibly basic, but I can imagine that the simplicity wouldn't be an issue to everyone.   - 'By Azura, by Azura, by Azura, it's the GRAND CHAMPION!!!' Run for your life the moment anybody says this to you.",

I'd say it's a pretty good balance of what Morrowind and Skyrim do well. The Main Quest is also very good, albeit it can be completed rather quickly. You'll also have to deal with a subpar loot system and some of the most hideous characters you've ever seen (lol) but that aside, it's a solid title, and definitely check it out.",

Remember it's not a new title so some modern feature(s) you want wont be there, keep your expectations in the date of its release and if you want anything modern [like] you may want to mod it or such. As lots of Lore and plenty to explore!  As someone with a collection of physical copies of games I would recommend going to a gaming store and looking for the box (in good condition if you like box art). I'm not to sure (other then a DRM) but the physical copy [pc version] required steam for activation but did not download from steam to install and I did recieved a digital copy that is easy to mod. Use steam for it's sales to get it cheap or pay full price. It really doesn't matter other then your budget and what you are comfortable paying for the steam version.",

The story, quest system, combat, and roleplaying capabilities of this game left a powerful impression on how games are created now. Sadly, Bethesda has shyed away from their incredible roleplaying aspect of Oblivion, and focused mainly on a combat system for Skyrim and Fallout 4, leaving them dry and easy to get bored with. Oblivion is still, 10 years later, my absolute favorite game. I wish Skyrims graphics and enhancements to controls and gameplay hadn't ruined me, or I would be constantly still immersed in this game. It, as well as Fallout 3, are the only 2 of Bethesda's games that I have been able to finish their main questlines. It is sad that the others, though newer and more enhanced, could not get more time and dedication from me and Oblivion has. I recommend this game to any and everyone. I think it stands as an important milestone for gaming and everyone should have the honor to play this game. I destroys every other rpg game to date (in my opinion), and still stands as a fun and entertaining game 10 years after it's release. I hope more people play this game before they play skyrim and fallout 4, because this one's story and just overall being, has totally been the absolute best in the franchise.",

First, let me say that Steam is bad at counting- I probably have around 125 to 175 hours in each of these games (Oblivion more on the latter side, and Skyrim closer to the former). I may not be the most qualified to write about this, but I've seen good amounts of these games, and while Skyrim has better graphics, dragons, dual weilding and that sort of thing, Oblivion has the Shivering Isles, a great Dark Brotherhood questline, and probably some other things I'm forgetting now that make it a much more enjoyable game (for me, at least) and easily one of my favorites. The Shivering Isles and Dark Brotherhood sections of Oblivion are just amazing and are worth the lower texture quality and complete lack of dragons that the game, sadly, has.  Just wanted to put my opinion about these games out there. They're both amazing- you should definately buy them both if you enjoy open-world fantasy games- but if you're trying to decide between the two, I say go with Oblivion.",

I owned this game before I bought the GOTY edition on steam and have sunk many hours of my youth/young adult-hood into it and have probably created a collective of over 10 characters all reaching high levels.

First is the RPG system, in all RPG's you pick a class, Mage, Warrior, or rouge, but in oblivion you can make your own class like a sneaky mage, or even a paladin if your really hard into role playing, Secondly, you only level what is useful to your character like if I use a sword to kill something ill get better at killing things with swords and it won't level up my axe skill which is great, in too many RPG's when you level up it also levels you magic and other random stuff you may never even use.  Secondly is the exploration, This map is HUGE and that's just the base game map and not even the Shivering isle DLC map which add another 20 hours of missions and exploration, but the base game map easily has 40 to 50 hours of just finding new places, which makes for an immersvie and life like world, to go and see ancient runis, or a castle with a dungeon in it is always interesting because you don't know what loot is in there or what creature is in there as well.  Next is the enemies, Oblivion has in my opinion the best and most diverse cast of enemies, ranging from rats and goblins to deamons and minatours, and as you level up new enemies appear, so you won't be fighting deadra from the get go but at around level 10 to 20 you will.  Lastly the music, this game is the last elder scrolls game to have ABSOLUTLEY beautiful music, and compaired to skyrim which the only track anyone remebers from that is the theme, oblivion has so many, like the imperail market theme and the opening theme, moreover just the music that plays as you're exploring the wilds of the imperial province is breath taking.  Honestly i've only scratched the serface of what makes this game great and one of the best Elder scrolls games, I whole heartedly recomend this game at it's asking price since it also gives you the DLC added into it and the whole package is about 200 hours to find everything in this game, since it makes you replay it because you can't do everything in one character like you can in skyrim.",

You can buy a house in each city and then buy furniture for the house. After that you can store your awesome weapons and armor in your houses storage. You can enchant items and make your own spells, rob people, become invisible, suck blood as a vampire, fight as a champion in the coliseum, and much much more. What i love about this game as opposed to skyrim is the dungeons respawn. and the world is huge, you can wander for hours picking plants for alchemy. One of the hardest, longest quests in this game entails picking nirnroots all over the world, one of the rarest plants. Sadly, i have never followed through to finish this quest.

With that out of the way, this is still my favourite game of the last generation. At the time it came out the scale and detail just blew away anything else out there. The environments still look fantastic and can be pimped up with mods now if you want more. Many of the questlines have excellent and engrossing stories and like all Bethesda games the lore and 'off the notebook' content is numerous and varied. Soundtrack is out of this world. Huge pile of content to keep you going and insane modding community for all manner of tweaks (as well as multiple high quality total conversions). Can't recommend this game enough.",

Set in fantasy medieval times on a distant, earth-like planet called Nirn, but with a variety of magic spells and creatures, you break out of jail as a tutorial and fend for yourself right outside the sewer exit. An extremely large map surrounds you while you have to scavenge for food, currency, weapons and armor. 250+ quests wait for you. The side-quests are of the plenty and they make your experience unique and amazing. A great level-up system is in place too, as you have to increase your skill levels to increase your overall level. Fantastic voice acting too. The downsides are that this is only a console port, so there are some bugs and a few broken quests in place, that had carried over from the console version as well. Control mapping is completely customizable, and seems well optimized. This game is so large that if I were to tell you everything about it, it could be a pretty thick book, so I'm just going to leave you with the rating and adventure.",

I prefer this game much more over skyrim because of the sheer color palette and musical score.

On my Xbox 360 I have at least 300 hours put into this game. I have made countless characters, each with their own story and each of them doing their own thing. My most recent character (The one I have played since I have gotten Oblivion for my PC) is an Orc named Rune. I have completed the main story, Shivering Isles, Knights of the Nine, Thieves Guild, Fighters Guild, and I am currently working on the Dark Brotherhood and the Mages Guild. I have player 28 hours in the past two weeks and I have lost track of time so many times.  Easily one of my favourite games on the market, and in my opinion, better than Skyrim or Morrowind. The guilds are a lot more in depth, and the story lines just make it feel like I am actually there.  Shivering Isles and Knights of the Nine are two of the best DLCs that I have ever played. Knights of the Nine gave me a refreshing view of the entire religion lore in the Elder Scrolls universe. Whereas with Shivering Isles, It gave me a breath of fresh air while looking at Daedric Princes and their realms. Easily 10/10 Overall the game does have some bugs, what game doesn't? But I believe that the Pros of this game definitely outweigh the Cons. The storyline for every guild and DLC makes for a refreshing entry into the Elder Scrolls saga. The AI and voices might not be the best, considering only like 8 voice actors were used, but if you can see past that you will see an amazing game that has been pushed aside by the more casual gamer in favour of a newer game with a dumbed down storyline and better graphics.   I would recommend this game to anyone who asked for a great game. I rate this game 10/10 for creativity and great stories, and countless hours of running away in fear from Headless Zombies and Skeleton Heros.

The main quest for me was hard to put down once I began to pursue that plot. It smacked of high fantasy. I will admit I got into the Knights of the Nine DLC and was disappointed that it was as easy to complete as I found it. However the Shivering Isles DLC definately made up for that lack of difficulty.  My only real complaint, and it has always been there with Bethesda's games, there is never a way to complete the story by acting as a Truly Virtuous person. (a paladin character in other fantasy settings) It would be interesting to be able to complete one of these epics by never actually killing or by inaction allowing to be killed, any NPC. That is just my little peeve, but it does not detract from this game's story, or environment, or size.",

I'm going to start this review by saying that Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion might be my favorite game of all time. I got it for Christmas when I got my Xbox 360, and I still play it to this day. I'm aware there are fundamental problems with some aspects of the game, such as about seven voice actors in the entire game, not counting the Big Names they pulled, (Patrick Stewart, Sean Bean, Terrence Stamp). As well as some bugs in general, including this bug that keeps calling itself the 'Horse Armor DLC' that just won't go away.  Out of all the Elder Scrolls games that I've played, I have to say that this one has the best story, in my opinion. And by all of the ones I've played, I mean this, Skyrim, and Online. It has enough twists and turns, as well as good pacing, to get you immersed in the story, and the characters that are written into it such as Martin and Mankar Camoran are fantastic.  The factions and guilds are done much better in this than in Skyrim, in my opinion. You feel like an actual member of the guild who works their way up to the top through blood, sweat, and tears, rather than the Messiah that was delivered unto the people of whatever guild you're in to deliver them from the horrors of their own ineptitude. Also, the Thieves' Guild has an AMAZING storyline that kicks in all the way from the very beginning, with every action you take and every quest you complete working towards the end goal of the Guild's enigmatic leader, the Gray Fox.
