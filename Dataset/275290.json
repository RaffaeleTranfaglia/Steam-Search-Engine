            "review_text": "This is one of those games that confuse the hell out of you at first. First time I installed it, I hated it and regreted my decision of buying GTOS. Later on I cooled down and have read some of the other reviews and gave this babe another chance to prove itself. I spent couple more evenings trying to figure out what the hell is going on on my screen, studied a few tutorials and manuals online and then one moment it struck me. Damn! This game is absolute blast. I've played 90% percent of the WW2 games out there, no exagerrating, if you know some obscure WW2 FPS/RTS/Tactics, chances are I've played that. I'm wargames nut, I've played old and new games, I've played good and bad games. I've tried almost every popular and obscure WW2 games, it'd be pointless to list them all. But this one, believe me, will deliver you insane amount of fun if you will spend a bit more time learning how the stuff works here. Give gem a little care, treat it woth patience and it will treat you in return. It's new, it's fresh, it's a gorgeous game, beautiful and stunning outside and very deep and complicated inside.  It will suit all your WW2 nut needs. Amazing, breath-taking, painfully realistic, grim, brutal tank and infantry battles (with some close air support &amp; artillery options). I've never seen a combat in a WW2 game portrayed so gritty. Yet I've played Close Combat, Combat Mission, Men of War, Theatre of War (all of which I love and play till this day) but none of them could reach this level of aestethics. Men will scream, bleed to death, sand will fly in the air, shells will strike the ground and leave you deaf. It also has such important aspects as realistic radio &amp; wire lines system, something very similar to Combat Mission if you've played that. Chain of command is obviously present in the game too.  And the best thing? You can set everything and anything in this game, extensive number of options lets you edit the game experience to you liking, making it either a true, die-hard, hardcore war sim or arcade RTS, or even a mix of both. If you don't like micro-managing stuff too much it's okay, little men on the battlefield are smart enough to act on their own.  Few words regarding the setting, atmosphere and premise of this game. It's set in Ukraine/Russia circa 1941 to 1943. (Two of the DLCs are set in some-what moden time). One thing I'm going to say that is, Graviteam developers have hit the nail here. The land, terrain, nature, forests, atmosphere, sky.. Oh my god, it looks stunning. It absolutely perfectly depicts and resembles real places and lands. I myself was born in Russia and as a little kid, I used to walk around a lot, exploring all those forests and big, endless lands of my country and let me tell you a thing, if you're a foreigner, who wants to see true russian nature and not stereotypic stuff, play this game. It's art, pure art.  Do you like war movies? Hell, you can just start a battle, grab a glass of whatever favorite drink you prefer and watch the hell let and break loose.  One of the best games I've got from steam and absolutely deserved money that I paid in the past year. If you feel like it's too much for you, try waiting for a bit, they do have discounts sometime but nobody can predict when those happen.  No doubt, reccomended. Buy and see it for yourself, don't listen to anybody complaining about interface or other stuff, you WILL get used to it and it's going to be comfortable using it. Also keep in mind, this is not just an RTS, it's tactic, so all these buttons matter.  Last thing about DLCs. Yes, yes, yes, get all of them. (except hi-res textures, game looks fine as it is.) I oppose the idea of DLCs in general, but these are good, believe me, they are worth the price.  P.S. If you get in this game, after playing few battles you might want to get 'Aunthetic Battle Sound mod' and the 'Uniforms mod'. These two are mandatory for even better experience and are available on the internet. Do a little googling.  Feel free to ask me questions if you have any. Have a nice day.",

            "review_text": "Graviteam Tactics: Operation Star is not for you if you are simply a gamer. This is a game for tacticians; The armchair generals who have the patience to get past the immense learning curve. Do not expect to just jump right in and take command.   Your troops won't always just go and do what you tell them. If they are being torn apart, they may run away terrified on their own. Your soldiers may take the initiative and, with a lack of orders, charge headlong towards the enemy to destroy his positions. If your unit commander dies, multiple assets and communication break down. If your communications aren't effective, your units can't recieve orders.   The interface, though at first confusing, begins to make sense after paying attention during tutorials. If the player is willing to accept some devestating losses in the first few attempts, it isn't so bad. The layout is effective enough to apply all the necessary options for troop formations, movement and types of fire. It just takes some orientation to understand how to apply these options.   I am somewhat well versed in combined arms tactics and skills covered in Marine Corps warfighting doctrine (MCPD-1) and easily understand how and why this title is actually utilized in European militaries to train infantry officers and platoon leaders. The enemy UI is challenging and responds realistically and effectively to offense, but tends to do poorly when advancing or attacking. He tends to stop dead in his tracks during attacks when fired upon and consistently maintains a defensive posture. Hopefully in the future this can be tweaked a bit to give the UI a more impactful attack pattern.   You will find that application of standard military tactics per doctrine is played out extremely effectively. I.e. Deploying maching guns with long and unobstructive lines of sight, overlapping with infantry and armour. Or, combined arms suppressive fire.   Graphics are of the era this game was originally produced. Don't expect a melt-your-face mindblowing world here. But the graphics are good enough to get the job done and can still really impress at night. Smoke, tracers and explosion lighting give the game a real atmosphere. Speaking of atmosphere however; the ambient audio makes me want to throw my speakers across the room. Noises like a rooster ♥♥♥♥-a-doodle-doo'ing every 10 seconds become like nails on a chalkboard.   Fans of the Close Combat series, Combat Mission series, and even the Total War series will likely appreciate this game. Be warned however, the learning curve is several hours. Highly reccommended with enthusiasm.",

I have even won some battles ( Playing as Germans on the easy settings ).   The best bit of advice I found was to view the game as a 'Total War' type game. Turn based until the battle faze, a map area in which you move your forces, a deployment faze, a initial orders faze, then a battle faze and then the outcomes from the battle.  I am 53 and if like me you grew up throwing a dice and push little plastic soldiers and tanks around a sheet of wood.......You will love this game.",

        {
            "review_text": "I grew up playing games like Close Combat and Combat Mission, but I always felt like those two games could be improved upon. Close Combat, particularly the 2nd and 3rd games in the series, were a great mix of highly tactical combat with campaign systems that allowed your units to fight battles which affected future battles and operations. While the later games went on to have bigger battles and maps, they lost a bit of the magic of the early games where the battles felt much more like struggles and where your past mistakes could lead you to be stuck in situations in Arnhem, or wherever, where you had 4 squads and needed to hold on for a half hour to get a decent cease fire. On the other hand, the Combat Mission series took the war to 3D but kept the extremely complex morale system and tank combat. Yet I never found the series quite as engaging due to a lack of any meaningful campaign system and clunky, abstracted interface and graphics. What I always wanted more was a strategic system like that of the later Close Combat series mixed with 3D graphics, and I think I've found that in the Graviteam Tactics series.  I've now played a handful of different operations on some of the expansions as well as the original map and I've enjoyed it immensely. There was much talk about the terrible interface and whatnot in the reviews, but I think if you've played Close Combat or CM the controls are more or less normal, especially when using the right click interface to use the most common movement commands. That being said, the learning curve here will still be large for anyone new to the series and you probably won't do well your first battle. Incredibly, the game starts you out with a night mission where you will probably wonder at first if the game is even working. Once the first firefights kick off and you see tracers flying you'll probably be entertained enough just watching, but most people will probably be baffled as to how to do anything. The graphics and sounds as a whole do a great job of making you feel like you're really in a frozen battlefield, though the sounds aren't the highest quality.  I somehow won my first operation, despite having no idea how it really worked. I still don't really understand resupply or what half the indicators mean, even after reading the manual. But it's still a ton of fun and gives some really unique gameplay. The strategic layer adds a ton to the game, leaving you to make the decision to press for an attack with weakened troops or hold back and regroup. Sometimes you'll find yourself forced to defend for the 6th battle in a row with a couple of platoons reduced to a few squads with no ammo in a town reduced to rubble. When it comes to the battles themselves, they're an hour or less in length and vary wildly in how they go. At times you'll have battles where you and the enemy immediately cease fire because you're so weak. Other times you'll have a 45 minute long running gun battle with tanks exploding left and right and hundreds of casualties.  Generally your men do what you tell them to do, though you don't need to micromanage too much in this game. Even just using the right click command modes, there's a great variety of commands to give you flexibility. Morale and command are modeled well and I haven't seen many times where my men reacted in unexpected ways. Most battles I have played I enjoy, even when getting destroyed by the enemy, which happens more in this game than I'm used to from other games! Enemy AI tends to be smart and will maneuver around you if they find a way. Cover is well utilized in the game, with buildings, forests, hedgerows, etc giving your men cover in what feels like a realistic way. Using certain commands you can tell your men to find cover when they get to a place which is a great feature.   That all being said, this game isn't perfect. Tank pathfinding can be terrible and inexplicably dumb. Tanks will sometimes crash into a tree and not realize that they can back up and go around it. Sometimes things happen when it comes to the results of a battle which make no sense, and there's no real explanation of why you just knocked out 10 tanks and lost none but got a total defeat. Sometimes your men decide to lay in a field rather than the fence with bushes 5 feet away from them. But my biggest complaint thus far is with the friendly AI units.   In operations where you have allied units they will be AI controlled on the strategic map as well as in any battles where you have your own troops involved. I have found that on the strategic level they're worse than useless, with Tiger tank units moving to a far off, peaceful corner to defend nothing while Russian tanks destroy my lines just to the side of them, or my lone KV units deciding they just don't feel like fighting battles and moving behind my lines to hang out. If by some unfortunate event end up in a battle where you have all infantry and the AI controls your tanks or AT guns, forget it and just run away. The tanks will probably go get stuck in a ditch (or in one case, my AI tank decided to crash into a destroyed tank hull and get stuck there) or drive off away from your defenses. The AT guns will probably be in the middle of a forest and will ignore that road 20 feet away where the enemy tanks have to drive. Luckily, I've read that you can turn the AI control off and use the units as your own, with some penalties, which is still much better than letting the AI ruin your game.   Overall, however, the pros far outweigh the cons. This is a highly realistic, beautiful wargame which is a great successor to the Close Combat series. If you always wanted a 3D version of that and found other games lacking, this game is worth checking out. The AI isn't perfect, but the enemy AI at least is generally good and can beat me much of the time. The DLC that I have played are all very cool and well worth picking up, especially during a sale when it's 2 or 3 bucks for an operation which should give you 10-20 hours of new gameplay. I plan on buying the next game in the series once I've finished this one and all the DLC I bought, and I expect it to be great as well!",

It is extremely complex, and you'll lose more often than not.

Technically, what killed it for me was that if I changed literally any options it would crash and not make a difference the next time I launched the game, and since it was lagging with the settings it was on I was frustrated enough to eventually just get a refund. This frustration stems from speaking with either just one of the moderators or admins of the game or one of the developers about it, which sadly didn't do much despite a really great try from this guy!  Anyways, onto what I did play of it with my ♥♥♥♥♥ FPS.   Like I said, the game has a steep learning curve. Other than that it seems that shrubbery dotted around the landscape stops your line of sight really fast (I don't remember if it was just a couple 100 meters with a Halftrack. I imagine that it simulates the field of view from mister machine gunner on top of it, but like I wrote, couple 100 meters of line of sight. Other than that I drove a convoy of tanks and halftracks into a russian ambush where suddenly a tank was on my left flank, and then a bunch more came, along with infantry from all over the place except for behind me, 70 meters from me. This is an overreaction about the amount of units they had, I just got rekt really hard. The part about them being 70 meters from me is right though. This is all like 40 minutes of gameplay out of the about 8 Steam said I had.  I wrote this review at first with a dislike in mind but now I actually miss the game. Weird, right? I get the feeling that I missed out on a lot of the game by getting a refund... But it didn't work. It still gets a recommendation for what it is when it works, as I do like it in practice but there were technical problems.",
