            "review_text": "I'm having a ball with Shadow Complex Remastered. It's my opinion that they just don't make games like this very often anymore, and this has been a refreshing gaming experience for me. I love RPGs, ARPGs, Metroidvanias, and Platformers. This game as elements of all of these genres.   As a casual gamer, I do my best to avoid permadeath games and those that are unrealistically difficult just for the sake of being difficult. This game caters to both casual and hardcore gamers, because there are mechanisms for turning off the 'blue line' showing the route to your next objective and Master Challenges for those looking for a greater degree of difficulty. The blue guide line can be turned off and on at anytime, so if you get stuck or can't figure out where to go, this guide is there for you. Gamers are rewarded for exploration off the beaten path with upgrades and items, but if you stray too far, it's easy to find your way back to where you were.  Another plus for me is full controller support, and this game has very responsive controls. Jumping, shooting, takedowns, it all works just as it should. The graphics are really good, and while it's technically a side-scroller, there's an open world feel to it, because the character can go in any direction, even under water. New areas open up as new weapon upgrades are discovered, and gamers will find value in revisiting new areas to obtain hidden items they couldn't access before.  I can't say enough about this game. I paid full price for my copy, and it's been worth every penny.",

            "review_text": "Oh were to start, This is possibly one of the best 2D style Metroid/Castlevania games I have played in a long time. The premise is simble, America in the future, has a home grown group of terrorists trying to force a civil war, Jason Flemming (the main character you play as) Meets a girl at a bar and decide to go exploring a cave as a date. The cave turns out to hold the main base of the terrorists and she gets captured and you have to save the girl and save the day. There is some fun dialogue and the writing is entertaining but not memorable. What is memorable is the gameplay. If you ever liked the Metroid series or Castlevania series, you know exactly how this game works. Find a interesting bit of gear, this gear lets you explore the area until you either fight a boss or find new gear. Once you get the new gear, you can carry on forward or go back to get to areas you could not get to before and find more goodies hidden around the map that way. Repeat. The combat is fun and entertaining with ever improving quality of guns (5 total) and uprades for your character, Either Missles, grenades, Foam gun, Hook shot device, or even double and triple jumping and hyperspeed running where you can even go zipping by enemies while on the roof! The only real negative I have for this game is I originally bought and played this on my Xbox360 and it played completely fine, smooth frame rates and seemless transitions between sections of the map. Here on PC, I can get frozen screens, stuttering and for some reason the game likes to default to the lowest quality graphics settings whenever I exit and log back into the game, forcing me to change them back whenever I start playing again. All in all, the stuttering and temporary freezes happen enough to be noticed but not enough to really interfere negatively with the game experience itself. I Do have to wonder if the devs ported this without being fully optimized properly. I have other games with much higher system demands than this that I can run without these problems, and other games using the same engine as this don't have these problems either.  To sum up, If you have missed the old school Metroid style of exploring for fun and profit, You will most likely love this game and is well worth the price.",

            "review_text": "Even though game felt bit clunky, I kept on playing and the game was more fun as I progressed. Game map is done greatly, even tough I got stuck few times. Figgured that out by turning on objectives on the map and using flashlight. Yes, when you turn on flashlight you can see what is desctructible with what equipment. In addition to that game is filled with small and cool details. I like the fact that I can kick mine robots, run at hyperspeed on the ceiling, hookshot everywhere I want and thrust on ladders. Story is so bad, I didn't even care, when I got spoilers from trading cards. World feels bit generic. And some of the 'Boss fights' are just spam attack mess. But who cares as long as you have that nice and sexy suit. To sum it up Shadow Complex is one of the best metroidvania games on Steam you should get on sales.",

If you play on the lower difficulties, the same combat problem persists, but since you take much less damage you can simply 'tank' most areas and just exchange hits with the enemies. Very bland. :(   PROS: -Excellent level design -Variety of hidden items -The 2.5D combat was awesome. (Hint: when you hold hte 'aim mode' button, you put the cursor on enemies in the background and it will shoot them. If you let go of that button, your shots remain in your 'flat' 2D left/right path) -Good metroidvania style progression   CONS: -Boring combat (no real mechanics). 90% of combat with generic enemies consists of just trading blows with them. Since there isn't much you can do to avoid taking combat in many situations, it simply becomes a matter of 'do I have enough life to get to the next save room'? Not fun.",

            "review_text": "Had high hopes for this game based on the claim of 'metroidvania' and the great reviews over the years. Was excited that this game finally came out on PC as I thought it would never come. However, after playing this game I was throughly let down. This game is nowhere near the caliber of and is actually vastly inferior to games made 30 years ago such as: Metroid (NES), Super Metroid, Super Mario Bros., Contra (NES), Castlevania:SotN. Control mechanics are atrocious: very floaty, imprecise, and clunky. The game isn't necessarily difficult to play because of it, but just isn't honed enough to make this a fun fine-tuned run 'n gun platformer in the style of the games mentioned above. You can tell right away when you start walking and jumping around - just absolute slop.   The game is also billed as a platformer. Platformers require tight, responsive, and precise controls; this game just doesn't have it.   Games of this type which I actually recommend: Oniken, Odallus, Bionic Commando:Rearmed, Exile's End (cheap budget but way better than this junk), Axiom Verge, Super Cyborg (Contra-like), Strider, Vulgar the Viking, maybe Shovel Knight etc.  Game is also bloated with crappy cut-scene story... yes, you CAN skip them, but why should I even have to bother with getting my game interrupted?  I would maybe buy this game for $2.50, but $15 is exceedingly too much. I am in the process of requesting a refund.",

I'm about 2 hours in, and I already get the sense that there's more to go. I really can't wait to get a new piece of equipment or a gaget that help me get to even more secretive places! 4.5/5 stars y'all!",

            "review_text": "This game has been around for a while, and whilst i've been aware of it, I been too busy playing all the prettier AAA games to get round to this.  First off, I see a lot negative reviews relate to the graphics running slowly. I too had some slowdown issues at certain points, but adjusting the Direct X choice from within the game menus sorted it out completely.   Onto the game.  Pros This is a great 2D sidescoller. If this was a simple run and gun then it wouldn't have held my interest. However, the map holds many secrets and routes that change as your abilities increase throughout the game. The combat is reasonably basic, but fun nonetheless. You feel overpowered for most of the game, which for me made it more enjoyable. It didn't at any time feel like a slog. The game also provides an excellent map system, plus clear instructions on exactly where you need to go and what your objectives are at all times. Without this, I certainly would have got lost on the sprawling map.  Shadow Complex draws inspiration from many games. This is no bad thing, since many of them are some of my favourites.  If you are old enough to remember Sabatuer 2 on the Spectrum then this will seem familiar to you, however the most obvious comparison is with Metroid (not a bad thing!)  Cons Nolan North's voice acting is as good as you would expect, but the dialogue and plot are not the most interesting. however, this did not detract from the game at all for me. A sign of a good game for me is one that I can't stop playing until i complete it. This was one of those. It took me aroun 10 hours and I enjoyed all of it.   So in conclusion, if your not expecting an intricate plot and especially if you enjoyed Metroid, I highly recommend Shadow Complex.",

            "review_text": "Metroidvania style sidescroller set in an underground base riddled with rooms you don't have access to yet. Standard fare really, but quite well exectued.  The twist in this game is that it's fully 3D, so there can be enemies in the background shooting at you from a remote location, which you can not access since you can only move on a 2D plain. Sometimes you get into a turret section and the perspective shifts to a first person one. To me that was more of a gimmick since I don't really enjoy turret sections, thankfully there's only a couple of such instances.  I really enjoyed traversing across the map, it is very well laid out and sort of makes sense as an overall location. I played with mouse and keyboard and I disabled all auto aim options that I could. Some amount of auto aim remains, you have to actually mouse over the character in order to hit them, if they're positioned more into the background, the auto aim determines whether or not you managed that and you either shoot straight ahead or into the background. For the most part it is OK, only sometimes it just gets stuck on some terrain that you didn't think it really should have. Can't comment though what is the experience with a gamepad, since it was originally a console game it's probably much smoother.  I didn't really pay attention to the setting or the plot, since there's barely any story exposition in the game. It just serves to give you the next objective to perform, which was good enough for me for one playthrough.  To me what makes this game enjoyable is moving through the map, gaining new upgrades and consequently possibilities of how to move through the map.Much shorter than I expected though, and would have really benefitted from some real boss fights. The ones that it has aren't really that impressive, or hard. I like this style of game, just wish it had more substance.  6 / 10",
