As you probably would've guessed you play a cockroach in a nuclear wasteland in which you're suppose to shoot all the other bugs flying around.   The greatest thing about this game is probably the art, which is absolutely beautiful, too bad the gameplay is pretty straightforward (litterally). It's a shame the developers didn't create a different kind of game with the same graphics and creativity.  I'd recommend this game only to the hardcore horizontal shoot 'em up fans.  ",

            "review_text": "It seems keys are given away pretty often for this game, and you don't have to play long to understand why.  Let's start with the difficulty options: Hard, Hard, and Hard. There are three buttons, but they do nothing. Oh look, it's an attempt to be clever, or troll the player, or whatever the purpose was. Okay, I get it: No choice, expect rage-quit difficulty.  Except I wouldn't call the game hard. At least the core of it. And I don't normally play these kinds of games. Hell, I beat the first 3 stages just by idling in the same spot on the screen, holding LMB to fire, and occasionally using the special laser attack (RMB), which mows down enemies for a good 5 seconds or so. You can activate a shield with Space, but it doesn't make a difference. If you get hit you lose a life (3 per level) whether you're shielded or not, so I don't see why it was even included. (Maybe another 'hah, we're making this difficult' jab?) Both 'abilities' are only usable once per level. They reset when you die.  You're constantly moving forward (WASD adjusts your relative position), shooting stuff that comes flying at you and dodging repetitive obstacles like bugs carrying shields, wrecked bicycle wheels, ground canons, etc. It felt like a cartoony version of those old 'fixed shooter' arcade games. Or maybe a weak 'runner' game, just in the air and with a couple of weapons at your disposal.   The obstacles are the same in every stage, and in the same locations. Their patterns can be memorized via trial and error. The different swarms of insects are more annoying than difficult. Just stay to the left and keep firing constantly to clear the way, saving your laser attack for the more unpredictable types. The most difficult aspect is probably figuring out the hitbox of each enemy/obstacle/projectile, so you know just how far to nudge to avoid getting hit.   Each level adds a new obstacle/enemy or two, but the overall object is the same: shoot swarms and avoid predictable hazards till you reach the 'end' of a level. It gets boring quickly, because all you're really doing is correcting your errors until the whole level is burned into your brain. It's like the video game equivalent of memorizing a really long and pointless string of numbers. You repeat it over and over and over and over, and eventually you get 'good' at it by pure rote. But getting to that point is anything but fun, and there's nothing rewarding about it other than bragging to your friends, who are just gonna roll their eyes at you for attempting it in the first place.  Overall, I'm glad I didn't waste money on this. If you score a free key by all means try it out for yourself (or for the cards), but otherwise there's no point. There are no achievements, the 'plot' and minimal dialogue are hollow and uninteresting, and there's really no incentive to beat the game whatsoever. Save your money.",

Well... it most certainly hurt.  So what's wrong with it? Well... the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t 'one hit kill' obstacles? Endless array of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tty roaches flying in your face to the point where you cannot aim or dodge them consistently? Gun wielding roaches? Terrible level design? Not enough health? The skybox is a gradient? This list goes on.  I cannot begin to fathom how much I hate this game. I literally felt sick and gagged twice because this is so ♥♥♥♥ing annoying. It gave me the worst headache and cramp in my finger from having to constantly mash WASD with no braincells to back them up, because no person's brain can process the amount of cluster♥♥♥♥ that hits your screen. Leading on from that, the back of my eye essentially melted. It felt like the game placed a Bunsen burner on the back of my retina for two hours in the name of 'science'.  So why'd you play it if annoyed you so?   Trading Cards   Nononono!! That was the  original  reason but I felt a determination within me. The more I played the game, the more I felt sorry for our little protagonist. I didn't feel sorry for the fact it was being attacked by terrible antagonists and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t enemies. No... I felt sorry for it because this insect was the only one willing to stand up against the diabolical developers. Each time I'd hear his little 'Zooooooo' upon death, it ripped my heart in half. This poor little thing, did not deserve such an existence. It was brought into the world to suffer. Nothing more, nothing less.  Why? Why would you make such a game? The only concept is to endlessly torture a little lonely insect whom is controlled by someone raging and crying over the fact that they 'JUST HIT THE ♥♥♥♥ING BICYCLE WHEEL, EVEN THOUGH IT WAS BLOODY DODGED, WITH A SHIELD TOO!' The fact is... no one can defend this poor little creature. No one can defend against amazingly overpowered gun wielding purple cockroaches, whilst having spikes on the map that when touched with an iota amount... kills you.  To rap up this 'review': I GOT IT FOR FREE AND STILL THINK IT'S OVERPRICED, DO NOT-- I REPEAT, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. DO NOT ACCEPT THIS GAME AS GIFT! DO NOT EVEN LOOK AT THE GAME'S STEAM PAGE AGAIN!  'But wait, I already have it in my inventory, how do I remove it?'  Delete your Steam account.   'Hang on, what am I supposed to take from this review?'   'This game is the work of Satan.'   Thank you and goodbye    my little insect protagonist friend, hopefully someone will conquer this game and give you justice you truly deserve  .",

            "review_text": "No mouse control. Why am I not surprised?  Let's see how the controller... the hell? You move with the d-pad? Yeah, brilliant: make a game that requires precise movement and then give it a control scheme that doesn't allow for that.  Let's try it anyway. Music's pretty good, even though it doesn't loop properly.  Opens with a cutscene and, oh, wow, these animations! Everything's animated like the game's lagging, and yet objects are moving smoothly. It's perfectly playable, it just looks kinda crappy. Too bad; these character designs are quite nice and deserve better animation.  Hitboxes for enemies and objects seem a bit off. Not exactly ideal when movement consists of lurching in a direction and then skidding a bit further. Will I touch these spikes or just graze them? All up to fate, it would seem.  This combination of clumsy controls and shady hitboxes seems to be the main source of difficulty here. I'm getting annoyed. How much longer is this? Three more chapters? I'm about halfway done. No, scratch that. I'm fully and completely done. Got all the cards? Good. Exit game.  A good hard game makes me wonder, 'How do I do this?'  RADical ROACH  made me wonder, 'Why am I still doing this?' Maybe I should just stop playing shoot-em-ups. Maybe  Ballpoint Universe  and  Sine Mora  have set my expectations unreasonably high.  Sounds like a plan. Next time a bundle includes a shmup: Is it a bullet hell game with mouse control? No? Idle for cards and forget it was ever in my library. Awesome :)",

            "review_text": "'A game where you play a cockroach in a post nuclear apocalypse setting? Sign me up!' Unfortunately as cool as the premise of this game is, the execution is horribly lacking. You fly around as a silent roach spitting bubbles at various insects who hate you because ... you don't speak. It's a scrolling shoot 'em up (SHMUP) and a difficult one, but unlike other difficult SHMUPs like Ikaruga, Gradius or eXceed which test your skill, RADical ROACH tests your patience. Armed with only your bubbles, the game throws long, monotonous stages at you with only a single shield and super weapon to even the odds. You can take three hits before you die, but are given no period of invulnerability when you take a hit. This coupled with your large collision detection hitbox will often cause you to get hit many times in succession and die quickly. This is not delicious difficulty. This is punishing difficulty. I really love the premise, the art style, and the setting, but these cannot save a game that is completely broken. Don't get this game.",

You cannot collect power ups in the game, which is a let down since these type of games are known for fun power ups.  Audio is alright, nothing really stands out as being really good or making you getting excited to keep you playing the game.   Controls are alright, which makes the game somewhat tolerable.

A nuclear war has wiped out most life, except for some of the bugs, including our hero the roach with a red scarf, Radical Roach I presume. When the bugs rise up to conquer the remains of the world by force, the roach refuses, and becomes targeted, causing the bug to fight the other insects in the sky.   Basically, it's a simple space shooter, nothing too complex. I won't say it is easy, although at the moment I have only played a small portion of the game. I found it somewhat frustrating but far from impossible. I would say the difficult is around classic NES games.  Looks to be a fun time waster, but not one I would spend most of my time on.",
