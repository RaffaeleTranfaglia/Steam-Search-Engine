    "description": "Carmageddon is the original freeform driving sensation, where pedestrians (and cows!) equal points, and your opponents are a bunch of crazies in a twisted mix of automotive killing machines. The game features anarchic drive-wherever-you-like gameplay and over-the-top surreal comedy violence. It’s the racing game where racing is for wimps.",

            "review_text": "This game I got as a gift from a friend and holy...♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ it takes me back some 15+ years back into my mid-teens....I missed this game so much!!  For the ones that dont know, this game was based on the 1970's film Death Race 2000. This game become an instant cult hit back then when games were going through the hard time of being too violent ect. It stood out because, yes it was graphic and violent, but also it was a different sort of racing game. In such you can win a race by doing all the checkpoints in order and doing laps like a regular race, wrecking your opponents cars ( my tactic of choice ) or killing every single pedestrian on the map.  Along with these unique races come proper zany as hell power ups. Like my faves Solid Granite Car and Pedestrian Electro-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Ray...yes thats a thing...and many more, even combining into some outstanding effects.  The AI racers also have some good AI as well. They are set in their ways and go about racing their own way. Some wanna race, some wanna run over peds and some just wanna turn around and ram you all shapes to Sunday.  Yes the game looks dated, so what!? its a great game to begin with and has a sweet soundtrack, with 3 tracks supplied by Fear Factory from their album Demanufacture.  Nice and simple upgrade system, no fussing around or logic needed, just choose either upping your Offense, Armour or Speed.   All in all I am personally pleased this game has made it to Steam and give a new generation a chance at what was once one of the worlds more controversial games.",

            "review_text": "Carmageddon is a vehicular combat 'racing' game by UK developer Stainless Software released in 1997 to much acclaim for its advanced car damage model and sandbox style freedom and plenty of controversy for its depictions of gory carnage against defenseless pedestrians. This lead to an initially censored release for the UK version with zombies that bled green, the only way it was allowed to be sold until a patch was released later on to restore the original palette. The German version didn't fare much better however and was given robots instead that bled oil. Carmageddon's main inspiration comes from the 1975 film Death Race 2000 and was originally going to be a tie-in game but licensing fell through on more than one occasion, to the point Stainless said stuff it let's just get it out.  Carmageddon's a free-for-all race where you're encouraged to do whatever you want whenever you like and there is no restrictions on where you can go or what is considered fair or cheating. Your opponents will often be boring enough to race around the circuit and collect their weak paychecks from the checkpoints scattered about. Your opponents can't actually win anything however and there is no position of your standing in the race on your HUD. That's because you don't have one, and it doesn't matter anyway. What does matter is causing as much chaos as possible by either running down pedestrians, and in creative and gorier ways to net additional credits, and ramming the other cars. Wasting an opponent will give you a lot of credits, and more time than any other activity.  There's a timer that counts down at the beginning of each event and all manner of shenanigans will give you extra to allow you to explore the environment at your heart's content. For all manner of juicy bonuses and hidden bonus dosh/time and various PUPs (power-ups in Carma slang) litter the circuit and the outskirts of the race. These can be pretty gosh darned handy, for example complete invulnerability, acme damage magnifier for really putting a dent in your opponents, or pedestrian electro ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ray for 30 seconds. The wacky power-downs however come in a sizable variety and are usually harmless enough, but make your vehicle harder to drive for a short period of time. Pinball mode though is a worthy mention as its especially nasty and you'll want to recover ASAP if you're flung into orbit to prevent reparing serious damage.  You cannot actually be wasted yourself (at least in this first installment) but credits earned during the race are often used to repair your car, and repairing and recovering when you're on your roof or side will be happening a lot. So it's crucial to scouring and looting the race as much as possible to get more money to have enough left over at the end of a race. If you lose more than you make during a race and you didn't have much left over to begin with when you began the race your bank will go into a screaming fit and pull the plug, and this constitutes as 'game over' here. Failing a race by running out of time isn't penalizing though and you can simply jump back in and try again. You use credits earned between races to upgrade your car's abilities via APO (armor, power, offensive), which are bare-bones as upgrades come and simply make you more resistant to impacts, more horsepower, and dish out extra abuse when colliding into your opponents.  All races are won in three Carma fashions: Kill all pedestrians, waste all opponents, or complete all laps. The latter is reserved for ponces however and won't really give you a whole lot of credits but it's there to sate your particular needs, you weirdo. Murdering every ped is no easy feat however, but most levels usually have a Pedestrian Respawn or two (or three) somewhere and memorizing the locations of these after you wipe out a quarter or two of the population and going back for it can give you an extra edge. Participating in races is also done by a ranking system (which was brought back in Reincarnation/Max Damage) and you start at a lowly 99 with three races to choose from and the penultimate goal is to be number one, along the way will be more challenging environments with more unhinged opponents (and cops in APCs who just refuse to get out of the way). Getting hundreds of thousands of credits an event will move the rank much more (up to 5 increases max or none whatsoever if you're absolute tripe).  The player can choose between two drivers at the start and a difficulty determining starting time in a race, credits and bonus time earned from activities and how aggressive your opponents are. It's best to start on 'normal' and see how you fare, and if you're the kind of person who hides under the table during thunderstorms then easy mode should be right up your alley. Max Damage and Die Anna are the main 'heroes' of the Death Race and drive a similar model of car. Max's all-round great Eagle is better suited to rammin' and slammin' however whereas Anna's Hawk is a faster but less strong car. Nevertheless Carmageddon is an early supporter of equality, and all manner of men and women are subjected to the same treatment. Be it behind the wheel or roadkill in the street. Sometimes when you waste a specific opponent you have a chance of stealing and adding it to your collection. Some of these can be very powerful, others not so much. Beating the game will unlock every single one, including those labeled as 'cheat', your reward for being the baddest dude.  Visually the game is competent, with adequate detail for the environments, early 3D models for vehicles and props that are well designed and pedestrians are rendered as 2D sprites via digitized actors. Their deaths are often extremely gruesome, easily making this the goriest entry of the series even with later installments featuring 3D peds that can lose their limbs. Sound design is loud and crunchy, and impacts with the environment and opponents feel very raw, and the peds incredibly nasty and satisfying. The soundtrack also features four tracks from Fear Factory's 1995 album Demanufacture in instrumental only form, most fitting choice given the game's militant gameplay in a pseudo-apocalyptic near future world.  I have very few complaints with the way this game plays, maybe that it goes on for far too long (36 races) especially if you're trying to do the best you can on each race which can run anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour on average. Late game opponents become real damage sponges if you don't nick a better set of wheels (the Eagle/Hawk just won't cut it even at max stats) and cops are extremely difficult to waste and become very common near the end but if you manage to steal an especially hard to acquire ride in the event 'Blood on the Rooftops' you will know sweet, sweet revenge for all the trouble they were giving you early on and finish the last handful of events with pure bloody malice.  Carmageddon is decidedly British in its portrayal of humor, with plenty of tongue-in-cheek jokes, British slang, and raunchiness suited for a mature audience. Which only makes sense given the dev is UK based. There's plenty of pop culture references from the era, akin to games like Duke Nukem 3D (even has a reference to OJ Simpson here too!). This should've been more than enough proof that Carmageddon's intentions were never meant to be mean-spirited or shock jockery (a suggestion to add pregnant women peds was flat out no'd), just the kind of things that make the devs ♥♥♥♥ themselves laughing. And you can tell they had a great time putting this game together, a real labor of love. Carmageddon also has an equally humorous and interesting development history if you look into it more. If you think most racing games are too dull and traditional and you want to insert more mayhem in to your driving experience than this game comes as highly recommended! And if you still can't get enough the Splat Pack expansion has even more content to offer. The antidote to all racers.  4.0/5",
