The game give you the option to create your own hero ( male or female ) and then start your quest . In each area there are many different kind of monsters to kill and gain points to upgrade your fighting moves and make yourself stronger.  I hope in the future , they added the option to make the game into full screen and to adjust the music vol",

            "review_text": "This is another clicker time-waster. It's a parody of Dragonball Z where you are the main hero instead. You basically choose the enemy you wish to attack and the program automatically deals damage to it. After some time, the creature dies and you repeat the cycle for the next one. The game gets stale like any other clicker game after the first 5 minutes.  There's nothing to look forward to in this game. Don't try it.  PROS 1. Free After no one wanted to buy Dragon Souls (I think it was the cash currency), it probably flopped and went free for all to try.  2. Not Much Need to Click Just choose your enemy and attack.  3. Alt Tab Works You can do other things while letting the program run.  CONS 1. Slow Really slow. They expect you to take 3 days playing this game.  2. Boring after the 1st 5 minutes Same cycle, same boring things. Pick enemy, smack 10 times, rinse and repeat.  3. Dragon Ball Z Parody It really is pretty lame copying Dragon Ball Z. Krallen instead of Krillin? Really? ",

            "review_text": "Why is a game that doesn't work on Steam, and why is it being advertised by Steam? This platform has gone down so very much in the recent years. This may work for you, or more likely; it won't even care to show its face as it will supposedly be running whilst in actuality be completely invisible. No window, nothing.  I wonder if this game has been tested, and it makes me wonder if Steam does any quality control whatsoever.  Or do they just look at the pictures provided by the developer and deem it 'fine'.  That surely has to be the case if games like 'Shonen Idle Z' get to have its place on their platform.  The premise of this 'game' seemed appealing, a cutesy idle game to waste of a couple of minutes on in transit. Or at least that's how I treat games like these, but alas even that was beyond the capabilities of this 'game' as it never worked in the first place. I tested the game on a Windows 10, a Windows 8, and a Windows 7. I refuse to try it on my El Capitan Macbook. Free or not this is unacceptable. An apology and a fix should come out as soon as humanly possible.",
