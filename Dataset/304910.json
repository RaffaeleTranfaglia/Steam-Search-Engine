            "review_text": "I was on here the other day looking for a Flight Simulator and i just so happened to come across Sky Gamblers. I've playerd the IOS Version of the game and really like it, so i had to check it out. When i watched the trailer i was in shock with how much better the Graphics were compared to the IOS Version. I bought the game thinking that it would have better detail, new planes, and more missions espicially with the price tag of $9.99. I was wrong, when i played it for the first time i noticed that everything was exactly the same in comparison to the IOS Version. I was deeply disappointed knowing that i wasted $9.99 for a game that i already had for $0.99. Im not saying that Sky Gamblers is a bad game but i dont recommend the PC version when you can get the game for $0.99 on IOS.",

            "review_text": "This game is not a flight simulator pure and so who is looking for this will be disappointed, as they will find an arcade game. There are models of complex flight and there are not all the planes of WWII. In particular, he feels the lack of heavy bombers like the B-24 or B-17 Flying Fortress. But it's a really fun game with beautiful graphics and good campaigns. The dogfights are fun and then there is a chance for everyone to shoot down enemy planes, even in multiplayer. Hopefully the boys' Atypical Games add other planes and scenarios to play. From buy. Great price.",

            "review_text": "To start with this is an arcade game and not a simulator, it was ported from phone to pc I think and they did quite a good job of it. I personally play it with a joystick and I have to say for a phone port this game has better joystick response than War Thunder when last i played that game. I had no trouble mapping buttons or with responsiveness in Storm Raiders compared to the buggy and mouse bias War Thunder which is a flight simulation game. That aside I really have been enjoying this game.  Pros: -Very easy to fly, it's just throttle up and you're off, this is an arcade game after all. -3 Difficulty settings. -Simple 3 modes wingman support: Attack / Defend / Formation -Multiple control types supported, works great with a flight stick. (I use the Logitech Extreme 3D Pro) -Good graphics, effects, &amp; atmosphere music with the exception of one of the campaign missions. -Larger scale air battles with large maps, you'll get into some decent furballs here. -Three short campaigns filled with fun as well as several solo game modes that mimic the multiplayer games.  -Active multiplayer online matches. (Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, &amp; Destroy the Base.) -Unlimited bullets with a heat mechanic, recharged rockets/bombs/torpedos mechanic. (Also a con for those who want realism.) -Toggle Aim Assist, personally I found it easier with this disabled as I could kill enemies from outside the lead que range. -New aircraft are earned by completing the campaigns and leveling up, you don't have to purchase them like the phone version.  Cons: -There's only one internal cockpit model used in every plane, very sad. :( -The campaigns are pretty short, about 5-6 missions long each it wont take long to finish them. (Also a pro for casuals.) -For those that like realism, there's unlimited ammo &amp; a radar system. (Again, it's an arcade game.) -The physics are not the greatest but only really is bothersome when landing, if you cut your engine by boosting too much, or running out of fuel via campaign event. (There is no actual fuel consumption.) My first landing in this game dropped me dead from 2 meters up for a successful three point landing vtol style. If you want a more realistic landing don't try to coast, go in low at 50% and grind the ground, wheels deploy automatically and then drop the throttle back. When you run out of fuel or kill your engine (temp only) you quite literally will start to drop straight down shortly after, there is no gliding in this game.  Really there isn't a whole lot about this game that bothers me, I really like flight games like the Ace Combat series up to game 5. (Assault Horizon was just a disappointment.) While this game isn't an Ace Combat with an amazing story I found the gameplay engaging and fun. At $9.99 I feel the game is well worth it.",

            "review_text": "Sky Gamblers: Storm Raiders is the third game in the Sky Gambler series, previously released as mobile games. As a result, this is turn-and-burn only, but for a WW2 turn and turn, it's surprisingly fun and decently balanced with some interesting complexities should you wish to delve into such.   For a mobile port, this game is actually quite good. Terrain and flying area is nice and big, objects are not oddly scaled (things are tiny in a distance). Details are not PC standard, but quite workable. Enemy planes break apart when you kill them, with a wing falling off, then the whole things spins and twists like a falling leaf. And so on. Ground targets can hide among trees but that's why you have rockets and bombs. Or for naval targets, you have torpedoes and bombs.   The engine can be 'boosted' for a short period of high speed, but engine will overheat after X seconds, and may shut down altogether (but it will restart once you cooled off). Guns will also overheat and prone to jamming should you held down the trigger for too long. The temp gauge on either weren't too obvious though.   There's quite a bit of decent single player content (2-3 campaigns, plus survival mode and dogfight mode) as well as full set of mulitplayer games including Capture the Flag, Free for All, and so on. There's also three difficulty levels so rookies can feel free to dive right in.   Don't expect too much realism, as you have P-40 Warhawks fighting the Luftwaffe, or Hurricane carrying torpedoes, and so on. A fighter here do often carry bombs. And many of the scenarios have you attempting to race to the airfield before your fuel runs out on a timer, not on actual fuel consumption. On the other hand, they can be quite exciting, and these missions do have checkpoints so if you fail, you aren't forced to start from the beginning.   Controls are easy enough, though the gamepad support should be better, as there needs to be some custom mapping. For games that supports such, I do 'RC controls' (i.e. stick one controls elevator and roll, while stick two controls throttle and rudder) and this game was able to do such, but it wasn't the default.   On some game types you can customize your plane, both paint job and the primary/secondary weapons, and choices are plenty, some are good for ground work, some are good for air attacks.   With four classes of planes (fighter, bomber, jet, and legend), there are plenty of choices and lots of customization options. Legend class contains very iconic fighters as well as some prototypes that never made it into service but were very good planes.   The interface is a little weird as often you have to rely on dragging to show more panels as there are no obvious signs there are more choices below; legacy of coming from a touch interface.   All in all, SGSR is a pretty good game, for the turn-and-burn crowd. Don't expect 'realism', flight model, and so on.",

            "review_text": "View my first playthrough   Here    This Arcade-style dogfighting game is a nice change from the horde of twitch-shooters currently on the market. It's one of those easy-to-learn-hard-to-master games that seems simple at first, but over time you'll learn there is depth to the combat. With close to 30 planes, all with varying stats and play-styles, you'll find something you like. The single player places you in one of three theatres of war across the globe during WWII. The difficulty ranges from â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥-easy to OMFG-EJECT EJEC-(explosion). You'll fly sorties for the British and the Americans fighting against Germany and Japan, all while utilizing various frames: fighter, bomber, and special role planes. Each with there own unique weapons. Frames are unlocked by perfoming campaing missions or playing multiplayer. The weapon and plane specifications could use an EXPLINATION, however. I'm not sure what some of these symbols mean, but I'm sure there is a wiki on it somewhere. Multi-player is fun and has several modes: capture the flag, defend the base, deathmatch, team deathmatch, last-man-standing, survival (horde, you and team versus NPCs) and even a free-flight mode for the achievment horses to mingle! In a market thourghly saturated with hyper-violent, grim and sexual content, this game is a breathe of fresh air. I would feel comfortable letting my kids play this game.   Final verdict: this game is good, not great, but with patching it has the potential for excellence. View my livestream at twitch for my first sortie with this game",

The game is compatible with a joystick which adds a whole new insite to the game. The keyboard controls (in my opinion) are a lot easier to control than tilting your phone everywhere. It can be played on bigger screens with better fps.",
