            "review_text": "This game has a framework with so much potential I was really excited the first few rounds.   Unfortunately, before long it starts to feel like playing rock-paper-scissors with, well, a computer. Random play is equally effective as well-thought strategy and winning or losing feels like a flip of the coin. However if you lose a round the computer will replay the round virtually identically so it becomes trivial to win next time.  There's a really good game waiting to be made here, but this isn't it.     ",

            "review_text": "I tried really hard to like this game. I beat the main campaign and then did the NG+. I lost countless times on the second map, which is part of the NG tutorial. You have a set deck of cards, and it was still almost impossible to beat and required amazing luck.  And that's what makes this game so bad. This game lacks strategy. There is a little bit in deck building, but even if you have the best deck for a mission, there's a big chance you'll lose because of the luck of the draw. The last two boss fights had me cursing at the screen because the game puts all odds against you.  Losing isn't fun, and this game does its best to make sure that you're going to lose. This game isn't worth it for free because it will just stress you out trying to enjoy it.",

            "review_text": "The alluring depth of a deck-building card game. The rapid-fire fun of turn-based tactical combat on a short timer. These two things synergize beautifully in this unique title from Zachtronics Industries, whom you might know from other games such as Spacechem and Infiniminer.  Based on your love (or lack thereof) for card-games and/or tactics games, you should know right off the bat if Ironclad Tactics is for you. What you might not suspect, however, is just how beautifully polished this game is, offering singleplayer as well as both co-op and competitive multiplayer in a neatly-presented package.  With artwork, sound, and interface design, Zachtronics has clearly lavished their game with a great deal of time and attention. When starting a new single player campaign, players will be introduced to the world through a series of stunning comic book-style panels. The artwork is colorful and the characters charming, with a breadth of facial expression rivaling that of some of the better webcomics out there. A similar level of care has been given to the in-battle presentation, with each unit and weapon having its own distinctive feel through a combination of looks, good sound effects, and interesting mechanics. Menus too are slick, with even more beautiful art and smooth animations. The whole experience is then tied-together with great music that had me feeling nostalgic for classic turn-based games like Final Fantasy Tactics.  If any of this sounds appealing to you then there's no reason to delay - check out the trailer and then have some fun with Ironclad Tactics!",

            "review_text": "I got this game in a bundle and I was so happy that I decided to give it a try - I would easily purchase it individually.  If you enjoy deck-building card game, laning-style gameplay, and the steampunk theme, then you will love this game.  The aesthetics are great - the detail put into the cartoon-style graphics are very nice. The cutscenes are delivered in a comic-book style format, and the art is well done. The music is sounds are also good and add to the atmosphere of the industrial-age setting.   I found the story to be decent, nothing too spectacular, but still very good. The expansions are also a lot of fun.  The controls are very simple since you are primarily clicking on your cards to use, however, the learning curve can range from moderate to difficult. You will be at a good advantage if you are already knowledgeable in deck-building/pre-deck trading card games. Understanding the mechanic of 'synergy,' or making sure that every single card in your deck has a purpose will ensure that you do well. If you are a newcomer, the tutorial is very helpful in giving you a firm grasp on the gameplay, and the extra challenges for each mission (which yield more cards) will also help you better understand how to make effective decks.  You play the game by using decks of exactly 30 cards, with no more than 4 of each card. During gameplay, you randomly draw any card from your deck and it is put on a conveyor-style menu at the bottom of the screen. You also get 1 action point per turn, and these are used to purchase (and immediately use) your available cards. If your card pool is full, then the last card on the right will be discarded. There is an option to spend 1 AP in order to move the last card to the front of the lineup. There appears to be no draw limit, as you will cycle through your cards repeatedly (don't think you can run out of cards).  Cards consist of units (infantry or 'ironclads,' which are basically steampunk, industrial-era mechs), parts for your ironclads, and tactics. After completing missions, you are rewarded with more cards. There are also different challenges you can complete for each stage to unlock even more cards. New game+ is available, however, it is very challenging if you are not using a solid deck. There are multiple 'factions,' (ex: army, experimental, etc) and your deck may be composed of a maximum of 2. The variety of cards leads to interesting strategies and surprises. Some cards have the potential for 'upgrades,' where you can unlock a better version of the card if you complete something (ex: 'deploy this ironclad x times,' 'this ironclad dies 5 times,' 'deal 30 damage with this infantry unit (cumulative.').  During play, you can summon units to move across the map (1 space forward per round, assuming default speed (=1)). You can click your units to have them hold position, and this is useful for camping your infantry on a mortar spot, which will generate 1 victory point for you each turn as long as it is occupied. Ironclads can trample most infantry units, resulting in instant kills. Getting an ironclad to the enemies side of the screen will yield you victory points (minimum 1). If you get the required number of victory points before your opponent, you win!   Since ironclads enter the battle unarmed, you can attach different parts (a head piece and an arm piece) onto them - you are able to exchange parts so long as you have the cards and the AP. Example pieces include a shotgun, which shoots units in a radius in front of the unit; and a cat pilot that increases movement speed (3 spaces forward every round).   Tactics cards include: giving an extra attack to your infantry/ironclad (separate cards), allowing your unit to move either one space up or down (lane changing), and bombarding an entire row for 2 damage each.  The feedback is very useful and informative - you can hover over units at any time to see their attack range, damage, and stats.   If you enjoy laning and/or card-building games, then give this gem a try, you may spend a lot of time playing this one.  Highly recommend!",

I raged to the point to where I didn't know whether I was the Confederacy or the North but the Final Boss (who shall not be named due to spoilers) had me raging. I loved the game, card system, matches and the little Ironclads were pimping. Credits and musical score at the end were rocking. Rock on little robot dudes",

            "review_text": "I like this game, and I can't quite put a finger on why. It's unique in the sense that there is no other strategy game which quite has the same mechanics, but it also lacks a compelling hook to grab the player. It's fast paced, frantic, and in many ways based on luck (What cards you pull from your pre built deck), but akin to magic the gathering deck construction / field choices usually win out. I'm going to go against the grain on this one and give it a recommendation not because the game is inherently incredible, but instead because it's faultastically innovative. It's shortcoming is also it's greatest strength. If you like card games and RTS, you'll probably have a bit of fun with this one.   7.5/10",

            "review_text": "Quite possibly the best dual player gaming epxerience of 2013.   When I first discovered Ironclad Tactics I immediately rushed to inform my gaming partner that there was a '2 player, co-op, real-time, tactical, card based, RPG on steam...that also runs on Mac'. He said 'oh you and your crazy lies. Let me guess, it's probably about steam powered battle robots in, oh, i dunno, the american civil war'. I said 'Yeah! And there's a cat with a monacle!'.  I haven't been this satisfied with a game in a long while. It's fast, it's fun, it's challenging, it's rewarding and best of all it's cooperative. I cannot stress enough how much more satisfying it is to overcome obstacles and challanges with a partner than by yourself and the co-op system in this game is absolutely masterful. My partner and I would frequently take the opportunity to build complimentary decks, taking turns filling specific roles and amplifying each other strengths, or, compensating for each others weaknesses.   The game features a beautifully executed diffiulty curve, with challenges that constantly demand new decks and new strategies and always feels just slightly harder than you're capable of. So, when you manage to beat that level and all of its challenges, that accomplishment actually means something. Not a lot of games deliver that kind of satisfaction.  The only real criticism I can give to Ironclad Tactics is that it's short and the multiplayer doesnt hold a lot of interest for me due to its limited versatility. In a 1-on-1 match, there are only so many viable card combinations and with no new cards coming out the game has serious mortality issues. But all good things must come to an end, right?  Great game, awesome multiplayer, it was well worth the cost.",

Later you can build your own card decks or beat missions with infinite card dropping. Tip: Use pause button on your Ironclads to stand them. Tip2: You can repair your Ironclads.",

It's not really my sort of game, but it is decent enough so I can't just give this a no and walk away. Hopefully other people can have fun with it. :3",
