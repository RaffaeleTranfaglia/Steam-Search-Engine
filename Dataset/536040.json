            "review_text": "  My girlfriend purchased this game for me, knowing well that I'm a big dork for anything Lovecraftian.  I gotta say, the trailer makes this game look odd. But, the game itself is actually pretty addictive and really fun! The artstyle is really metal, but for some reason the playable character looks a lot more anime-ish if you ask me.  The game is pretty simple, and easy to understand. You pick a card to add to your deck whenever you move forward, and use them wisely against your foes. If you die, you start over from scratch.  ( The rogue-like nature is perfect the way it is, as you shouldn't feel empowered in a Lovecraftian game. )  Pretty small game, but really fun to go through. Hopefully, more is added to the game later on. As it's a hella fun to play.",
