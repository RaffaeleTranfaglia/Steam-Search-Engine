            "review_text": "Full disclosure: I backed this game on Kickstarter. That being said, I have had plenty of regretful games come my way through Kickstarter, as well as many great ones, and more than enough that fall into the line of being simply mediocre. Also, my play clock is based on the Steam release. As a backer, I've had the DRM free version of this game for several months. Since no other reviews are on Steam for this game, I felt despite the potential of looking biased, I should say something about this game.  First off, I should say that if you haven't played Data Hacker: Initiation, you might want to check that out first as this game is a sequel, including allowing you to import your save file from Initiation.  Data Hacker: Corruption (DHC) is a turn based RPG made in RPG Maker. Normally that can be an instant turn off even for turn based RPG fans since many RPG Maker games that end up on Steam (or elsewhere) are sloppy affairs that try to tell a typical story using many of the core RPG Maker assets and not much else.  New Reality goes full in in all possible areas. The first thing you will notice when you start the game is that the sprites, tilesets, and background artwork has been masterfully made for this game. There is very little of the original RPG Maker left in this beyond the engine itself. Unlike most RPG Maker titles, you have several resolution options. Unfortunately, once you begin the game, you cannot change your resolution. Still, having this option shows the attention to detail that went into the game.  The audio is most an amazing experience. The music that has been scored for DHC is beautiful and manages to both evoke the SNES era that RPG Maker represent, while also sounding a fair bit more in tune with modern abilities to make an electronic sounding sountrack. There is also a fair amount of voice acting, which can be a mixed bag. Some voices are great, and are acted with proper emotional cues. There are, unfortunately, a couple (Jay, the main character, being one) voices that just seem to grate on my nerves. This is not a deal breaker, but it makes me wish for a voices option just because I don't want to mute the wonderful background music. Also, for the spoken lines, they do not stop if you advance the typed dialogue before the line has been said to completion. If you're a quick reader of dialogue, you can expect to hear multiple lines of dialogue being said on top of each other.  As for the game play, it is very much in line with RPG Maker games at its core. You have turn based combat. You see enemies on the field (no random encounters). You start combat by queuing up the commands for each party member and then watch as your party and the enemies act according to their speed in battle. In DHC you do not regain HP, MP, or come back to life (if a party member dies) when combat ends. You also have the TP system used by many RPG Maker games in which you gain TP which can fuel special physical abilities. The method to gain these can be adjusted in the skills menu so that you can get TP when you do nothing, cause damamge, when your party members are injured, or several other ways.  To add some variety versus the RPG Maker basics, there are both the hacking abilities and a bonus card game called Trioarch, which is quite similar to the card games found in Final Fantasy 8 and 9. I honestly can't say much for the Trioarch game, since I've never been a fan of added card games in RPGs. As for the hacking, this allows you to alter the world in some fun ways. Some NPCs can be eliminated if you feel so inclined, you can end battles through successful hacking to get rare special items that are not readily available by just damaging your foe until they perish, and due to hacking the game leaves your main character open to taking on whatever job/role you want. No forced class on the protagonist.  I think the most important piece that DHC brings to the table would be the story. When you start the game, you are asked a couple questions, and these will determine the path you take in the game. Essentially, there are two games in one, which adds a nice bit of replay value. When you are looking at a $5 game, getting a second adventure out of a ~20-30 hour game is great.  You play as Jay, who is a hacker in a dystopian future. The game takes place in Online World, which is an escape from realy MMORPG. A war starts to unfold between two major factions. One side is fighting for the virtual world, and the other for real people. The plot contains a lot of twists and takes a subject that has been done so poorly by games like .Hack and makes it fun and intriguing.  The only major downsides to DHC come from the RPG Maker backbone. First off, the menues are clunky. If you want to change equipment on several party members, you have to back out from one equipment menu then select to go into the next characters equipment screen. There is no way to quickly move from one character to another. When you have so many different types of stats based on equipment that is being shared among a party, this makes menu navigation a little bit like a chore. You also have what I think of as the backwards control layout of RPG Maker. When a XBox 360 controller, X is the action button, which always feels wrong.  I don't think I can recommend this game to everyone, but for fans of SNES era turn based RPGs, this game is worth checking out. I'd suggest playing Data Hacker: Initiation first, since the plot will be confusing at first otherwise. I'd also say if you are someone who just cannot get past the RPG Maker engine, no matter how much work goes into giving the game life on its own, then this is not for you. If you can deal with RPG Maker, love a great story, and enjoy turn based RPGs, then you could do far worse for $5. When you consider the second possible quest/storyline, $5 is a bargain for a great experience.",
