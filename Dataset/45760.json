In reality this is psychological fighter IV, and if you like deep games, you can forget about any of the other ones out there.   USF4 takes the cake.",

I recommend it to pretty much anyone. If you're new to the fighting game genre, don't be afraid. AE is probably the best modern fighter to start with if you want to learn how to fighting. AE is not terribly complex, and there are plenty of resources out there to help you learn how to play. Buy this game when it's cheap so that you can get ready for USFIV.  Or you could just wait for USFIV. It's probably cheaper if you buy this discounted and buy the USFIV upgrade though.",

The controls are 'responsive'. Too responsive. Unless you hit that punch button the exact moment you make that quarter circle, you won't get the Hadouken. Once your opponent traps you in their combo, there's no escape. The block will work, miraculously only.   If you want to play for fun, this game is not for you. You'll just get mad when your moves won't execute which will be a big buzz kill. Trust me. I tested this by playing with someone in my house. We both got frustrated in the 5th round. If you're into a rough community and games that require a week to perfect your skills, go ahead. Get this amazing jewel. If you want to have fun, I can recommend Super Smash Brothers. In Super Smash Brothers, you'll have bigger windows of opportunity to escape from combos or make comebacks.  The music is great. The main menu music is AWESOME!!! YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW, MAN. I MASTURBATE AND ♥♥♥♥ DIAMONDS TO THAT MAIN MENU MUSIC. It's my waifu.  The art in the menus are quite awesome too. When you start up the game you get a cool opening scene of all the characters fighting. It's not an in-game battle. It's an animated battle. THAT'S RIGHT, you'll see the characters pull off a bunch of crazy ♥♥♥♥ against each other.  Would rage quit again, 10/10.  Edit: Actually... The game's multiplayer is GENUNELY ♥♥♥♥. People will spam combos. There won't be any escape once you're trapped in a combo. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME if you want to play a game that's balanced. In my opinion, this game is ♥♥♥♥ unless you play Character X VS Character X. Same Char VS Same Char. In fact, don't buy it. It doesn't deserve it. Just buy the soundtrack. Get a better fighting game where you actually have a chance to block anything but require skill.",

I am not good-at-all at it but Ultra Street Fighter IV (USFIV) is clearly the only fighting game that make me want to be better at it. This game is awesome. Really, it is. It's also a great game if you're really strong at fighting games of course don't worry.  Let's make a list.  Pros ; + Controls ; You have a couple of choice, arcade controller (the best), the XBOX or basic controller (the good) and the keyboard (the not-so-good). I am playing on keyboard and Capcom show us that it's possible to play with a keyboard at Street Fighter.  + Ambiance ; One of the most intense and greatest ambiance I ever saw in a videogame.  + Sound ; With quality voice acting and sounds, it won't hurt your ears and it keep the great ambiance. + Music ; I am not into Techno music but this game have clearly great musics that fit every situations. + Graphism ; Colorful and awesome. The characters animations were really polished and all the extra effects look perfect. + Storyline ; Yes, there is a storyline for EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER in the Arcade mode. Every character have their own theme, rivals, boss and cutscene (let's not forget about the animation that starts at the begining of a fight too.) + Character choice ; There is a lot of playable characters which made the Street Fighter Universe so great. Make your choice. Play only with your special someone or try'em all. + Character customization ; You can change the color of your character clothes and even changing them if you have the correct DLC of course. + Difficulty ; There not only Easy Medium and Hard there is like 10 differents difficulties. You just need to pick-up the one that fits you which make this game perfect for Not-good players or Super strong players. + 2 Players party ; Of course, why in the world would you not being able to play with your (real-life) friend at a Street Fighter game? + Training and Challenge Mode ; Those are great and can really help you to figure out some new tricks for your favorite character.  Cons ; - Online ; No much people and most of them are smurfs and people that is playing fighting games from the time they're 5. No actual rookie, initiated, causual or even intermediate players. Only brainless phycos that absolutely need to play with a stick.  - Online lag ; Like the online matchmaking isn't already that hard. There is a serious problem about the lags in this game. - Team Match ; It looks interesting, but I was never able to find a single server. - DLCs ; It bring great customization possibilities but it's expensive. Like 5€ for 4~5 outfits. - Difficulty at the end of the Arcade Mode ; When you're going for the boss it will be really, really, really harder that the other folks you just met ealier. It can be really frustrating sometimes. - Achievements difficulty ; Why Capcom, why ? These achivements are super hard, really.  TL;DR Overall, this is great. Really. But don't bet on the Online mode, it's not nice. However the Arcade and Versus Mode are awesome. You will really have fun by playing this game. It worth the price, definitly  → 89/100",

That said this I got this with most of its DLC on sale and can't complain since I do not own any version of Street Fighter IV on Steam besides this. This game right to exist is ♥♥♥♥. The game itself however is not bad. Personally I like Super Turbo/X, V, and especially 3rd Strike more. However this is a good fighting game overall. If you have not played any version of Street Fighter IV yet I will say this is a must play. The netcode is a bit better considering most non-GGPO Capcom netcodes are terrible, there might be way too much DLC but all the characters are here and the game is overall bursting with content without the DLC.  It is not the best Street Fighter and not the best Capcom fighting game, but its a good and solid game and its on Steam in its finest form.",

Everybody thought under XBOX Live playing Online Matches is awful but now we know better. Playing Online with Steam is even worst. The thing is, many PC Gamers hoped to get away from XBOX LIVE becaus it had some issues and the joy was great after the decision from Capcom to run USF4 only on STEAM and get away from XBOX LIVE and nobody could imagine this would work out so bad. I love this Game more than any other and I love the Street Fighter brand and all of its Versions but this is crap and this Game really doesn´t deserves this crap. I hope Capcom or Steam or whoever else can solve this Problem, but now in this moment where I´am writing this review I just can say DON´T BUY ULTRA STREET FIGHTER 4. DON´T BUY USF4. the Arcade Mode against the is nice but it can´t hold you to long. This game lives from the Fight against other Players and in a Time where Online Gaming is more than possible this is simply poor. How nobody in the Programming Process couldn´t recognize this bad Lagging. It´s simply unbelievable. I´m very Sorry but this is the truth, I hope Capcom or Steam can solve this Problem and this as quick as possible becaus I really think many Gamers out there are waiting to get their Gameplay to the next level and having some challenging and heated matches against each other.

If you're an experienced fighting game player you probably already know why you love or hate this game!***  This is the gold standard for fighting games. No fighter out there is more balanced, rewards fundamentals and guesses/reads more intelligently, or has the staying power of USF4.  The balance is so impressive. So often, fighting games eventually mature to the point where people have found the 2-3 most powerful characters and the rest of the cast is ignored. In USF4 there are definitely characters considered better than others, but the 'top tier' consists of almost a dozen characters, and every single character of the 40+ in the game, even the 'low tier' is extremely viable.  This game will force you to play more solidly than a lot of other fighters. Button mashers beware - you may take a few rounds now and then but this game is designed to punish you HARD. In fact, if you're new at this, THIS GAME AND EVERYONE WHO PLAYS IT WILL KICK YOUR ♥♥♥. It will stay that way for probably at least 100 hours in. And even then, the skill ceiling is practically infinite. When I bought Street Fighter 4: AE I knew nothing about fighting games. 1400 hours later I'm finally at a level where I'd consder myself 'decent'. On the way, I've discovered everything about what makes fighters an intelligent, deep, addicting, and all around amazing genre, way beyond what I had ever imagined. It's a genre that can make you feel the raw sting of defeat (where unlike in MOBAs, you only have yourself to blame) and the consequent high of a hard-won victory.   There is a definite lack of in-game resources for learning, so you'll start off stuck in a trench of sorts. You'll have to spend a long time reading up online and practicing to get acclamated to the game systems, which to some may seem archaic at times (1 frame links are a common source of frustration). But if you can fight through this and make it out of this phase you'll be on a journey to discover what makes fighting games truly amazing.",

Why is the execution in here so tedious to learn! Eventually, she started using easier characters like Ken, Ryu, Cody, and Cammy just to name a few. Ibuki quickly learned about tier lists, frame data, and what the heck 4F means! After spending enough hours in training mode, Ibuki was now ready to go online with all the work she did on practicing the many set-ups and match-ups each character had. Unfortunately, Ibuki's first ranked match was against a 7000BP Dudley as Rose no less and he wrecked the floor with Ibuki. Ibuki was letdown as it felt her whole time was waste, however she rewatched the match and noticed that she was too rushdown heavy with a non rushdown character. The rest is repeated but Ibuki can now fully understand how fighting games work after this experience.

Today I learned that the SNES controller is much better at Street Fighter games than my Logitech 310. I crouch hitting my left trigger just to watch my fighter looking at the other fighter without doing a sweep or anything. The control on USF4 is horrible (compared to SSF2T on SNES). I play sports games like FIFA and NBA 2k without any trouble but this game seems to not work unless you button smash. v,&gt;,punch does two moves and never the actual v,&gt;,punch move when you need it. The game also seems to not realize that you missed a flying kick or punch you cant go striaght into a move while still in the air after a miss but I guess logic has no place in this game.  Went to my friends house to pick up his arcade control and this game is amazing. You need the arcade style control to play it which is sad because as a young child I use to play with a gamepad and that's the only reason why I got this game. For Street Fighter fans I would say get it on sale. For someone just getting into Street Fighter I would totally tell you to get this game. I will try to get another gamepad to see if it makes the game better but I doubt it.  tl;dr game sucks with a gamepad but is awesome with arcade control 8/10",

It's a solid game offline (haven't played online) and the combo timing is more forgiving than other titles I've played in the genre. I'd say its major downside is that it feels old, because like most games that come from Capcom, this one doesn't rock the boat much.

Some characters are very simple for beginners and get gradually more complicated as you rise in skill level. That being said there are very few to no characters that i would say are 'op' or 'cheap' and none of which are unbeatable given your own skill level when facing them. The networking isn't the best as we all know, but I can't say that it's been horrid for me when playing with people in my area or others that share the same connection.

Lots of people complain about lag, but that's less true than it was a few months ago.   This is slow paced, and if you're like me, used to games like BlazBlu, Guilty Gear, etc, you're going to be thrown by the weird-♥♥♥ pacing, as the matches look less ilke dances far more like mind games. THat's not so much a knock on it, as it is a taste thing. As much fun as I have with this, it isn't my taste. But it would be unfair of me to say no to it purely on the grounds it's not my preferred type, that'd be like giving a Chinese restaurant a bad review for not serving pizzas.   What I can hold against it is its aesthetic. This game is ugly as a Brock Lesnar suplex. Some visual options make some slight increase in aesthetic, but not too much. I don't know what they were going for, but they missed. Bad.  As far as Street Fighter's go, it's, well, clearly a late game in the series. If you aren't a Street Fighter (or other fighting game fan) go back and futz around in the earlier games a while. It'll do you some good. Hell, if you are another game fan, at least give it a shot. That's the basis that later gaems like this are based off.   This game has a lot of systems to remember. I might actually say too many. Street FIghter's greatest advantage is its simplicity, and this feels more like something someone else should be making at times.   For all those criticisms, it's still good. It's a well-made fighting game. The iconic cast is present, and brings in some new friends as well. It could afford to be simpler, and prettier, but for what it is, you're getting your money's worth.

There are a huge number of characters to choose from each providing new and different styles for fighting. The original characters such as Ken and Ryu are as formidable as ever while newer characters such as C.Viper and Juri really put a spin on the fighting stlyes familiar to SF4.  If you find yourself being KO'ed too often then you can dial down the difficulty in arcade and versus mode when playing against the computer but against other players, I'm afraid only god can save you then. This goes to say that online mode especially now that the game has been out for some time is filled with experienced players so you'll need to put some hours in the training room.  All in all this is a great fighting game for beginners and experienced fighting nuts, with this game being continually updated with more characters especially with Ultra street fighter 4 already being released on console and coming soon on PC, you can be sure to find a great balanced fighting game if you buy this and future editions.

Game features the inclusion of 'focus attacks', a universal move that grants a character one hit of armour and the potential to crumple the opponent; the nature of focus attacks allow characters to aggressive advance through attacks without infringing upon the effectiveness of projectile characters.   Pros: - 39 characters, an additional 5 in Ultra Street Fighter 4. - The majority of match-ups are balanced (future update to provide further balance).  - Decent netcode if neither player has much traffic. - Large established player base online and offline. - Great for players trying to get into fighting games. Will teach fundamentals through play and the abundant tutorials on the internet.  Cons: - Single-player modes are lacking; arcade mode has terrible A.I. and the challenges aren't fun. - The game itself does not provide instruction to newer players. - No theatre mode for the animated clips from Arcade Mode.  Neutral Points: - There will be a learning curve; it is a fighting game afterall. If you are a new player then you will be terrible for a while. - Input leniency allows newer players to perform special moves more easily but can become an annoyance at higher level play. - There is a comeback factor for newer players (Ultra) which becomes a tool at higher level play. - The plot is barebones, but hey, that's a norm for fighting games.",

Capcom needs to put some titles on sale more often and for lower prices-I waited FOREVER for this version to hit a price point that I knew I would be comfortable buying it for, which adds to the mediocre attitude towards it. Any excitement or hype had been exhausted way before I bought this.  StreetFighter V will be released on PC in the new few months.  I've been playing this series since the original was introduced in 1987,(back when this title was about Skill) they lost me as a player after the addition of the super combos in versions after Street Fighter II′: Champion Edition,   this is an example of more not always being better,the button sequences to do super combos break the fluidity in gameplay.  I've talked to other players about this series lately and one of them said:' I hate that game because I never know if it's going to come out a single, double, triple fireball or blow up the whole F#ck!ng screen and waste the whole guage.'   I personally just don't like the graphics style,   This version is super slow as well compared to Hyper and Turbo which I feel were two of the best from the whole series.   I think Capcom should take this series back to it's roots, introduce a hyper  Remove the supercombos Super and EX guages and leave only the health bar.  I'd be back with a vengence. Until then,since I have played the whole series, I'm not that impressed with this title.  I highly suggest for younger players to get and at least try Streetfighter II turbo or Street Fighter II′: Champion Edition they were both more balanced and had better flow, if you play them you'll see what I mean.   So far early reports on Street fighter V show the same graphic style as IV with three new types of super combo.  Capcom isn't taking this series the direction I would like to see or play.  Just like with this version, I'll wait until it's on sale and buy it for lack of a better option in the Series and genre.",

            "review_text": "After the months and months of waiting for a PC version of Ultra Street Fighter 4 it is finally in my grubby hands. Was the wait worth it? That’s what I intend to reveal in this review.  PLATFORMS: Arcade, PC, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 PUBLISHER(S): Capcom DEVELOPER(S): Capcom GENRE(S): Fighter RELEASE DATE: June 3rd/4th (PSN / XBL), August 4th (retail) August 8th (Steam) PRICE: $14.99 (Upgrade) / $29.99 (Steam)  This is Street Fighter at it’s finest  This is the tried and true Street Fighter experience, which is a fantastic thing. If you’re a Street Fighter veteran, or if you’re new to the game or even the series, you’ll find it pretty easy to jump in and get a few rounds under your belt. And now that this version is on Steam, and not the ill-fated Microsoft Games for Windows Live, it’s a breeze to invite all your friends on Steam to a session or a lobby. Just send the invite to their steam avatar, and away you go.  On top of that, USF4 introduces several changes to the game; Red Focus / EX Red Focus (Useful for absorbing hits at the cost of meter), Ultra Combo Double which lets you use both of your ultra moves at the cost of them doing less damage, and Delay Standing, which lets you lay on the ground longer after knockdown attacks, as well as a huge slew of character changes in an attempt to make the roster balanced. Trust me folks, learn how to use Delay Standing as it will save your asses.  There’s also the ability to use more over powered characters like vanilla-Street Fighter IV Sagat, by turning back the clock and selecting their previous incarnations using the Edition Select Mode. This mode basically lets you choose specific versions of characters from previous iterations of Street Fighter IV (Street Fighter 4, Super Street Fighter 4, Super Street Fighter 4: Arcade Edition, Super Street Fighter 4: Arcade Edition 2012 or Ultra Street Fighter 4). Keep in mind however, that this feature is reserved for local game-play only. With the release of a new version, also comes new characters; and this time around we’re treated to 5 new faces to the Street Fighter IV series: Decapre, Hugo, Rolento, Poison, and Elena. The only truly “New” character being Decapre as she looks very similar to Cammy, but plays quite differently.  Another feature that Capcom added to Ultra Street Fighter 4, was the ability to upload matches to Youtube directly, however on the consoles it was limited to 480p (yuck). But thankfully this time around the PC version has an option for both 480p (Low) and 720p (high). Keep in mind that recording does introduce lag, as reported by members on the USF4 Steam forums. I’m not sure how many people would actually use this as there are better alternatives out there such as Nvidia’s Shadowplayfollow, OBS followor AMD’s Gaming Evolvedfollow. I’d also say FRAPs but that application while once a fan favorite simply adds way to much overhead during gameplay, and you simply wouldn’t want that in a fighting game.  So, one could say Ultra Street Fighter 4 is perhaps the ultimate fighting game for the PC – however, the game has it’s share of problems. Sadly, there is a current issue with the netcode that affects the quality of online game play. Typically you would expect players with good bandwidth connections to have smooth lag-free matches, recently however, that has proven incorrect. In fact, the last few matches I played had issues with the latency; definitely not something I’d expect from a decent connection. Going further I’ve also encountered a few dropped games in both random match-making, or when in a lobby with a few friends. While it’s a pain, it’s far from game-breaking, and thankfully Capcom is aware of the issues so we’ll hopefully see a patch for the issue sooner than later.   This is definitely the best looking version Ultra Street Fighter 4, hands down and thankfully this wasn’t just a straight port. I’m actually pretty impressed, as I was half expecting the game to be a port but instead we ended up getting the options PC gamers expect in a PC game. It’s all there, from V-SYNC, to setting a fixed or variable (Smooth) frame rate, Anti-alisasing (up to C16xQ), shadow adjustments, particle effects, and it all maxes out to the native resolution of you monitor.  Everything is very fluid, and the game runs like a champ on my PC and laptop (which is a far cry from a gaming laptop with it’s Intel HD 4400 integrated GPU ran the game decently). From what I can tell, this isn’t a resource hog, and scales very well – which is a huge plus.  And with typical Capcom flair, with a new version of Street Fighter comes new costumes and boy are they are something. Between the Summer Vacation, Alternate, and pre-order bonus costume sets, there are plenty of styles to choose from. And, if you upgraded from Super Street Fighter 4:AE to Ultra; any costumes you had will transfer over as well.  Though truth be told, some of those costumes are pretty wacky while others are damned cool.  Like I said I’m very impressed.  The background music for each stage has a catchy theme that gets you into the action, well other than the training stage room (I hate that stage). The soundtrack in USF4 is perhaps one of the best soundtracks that can be found in a fighting game today. Way before I had access to the game I was bumping the soundtrack, it’s that good. In fact, there’s just one other fighting game that I say rivals this game but I won’t mention it……. nah, I’ll say it; Killer Instinct 2013. Thankfully I didn’t hear that awful “Indestructible” tune anywhere, so hopefully Capcom wised up and removed it.  Summary Ultra Street Fighter 4 is the hands down best version of the entry to date and the best fighter currently available for the PC. This is the pinnacle of fighting games and Street Fighter 4 has been refined to the point where I highly doubt Capcom can outdue themselves again. PC gamers, this is the game to get if you like fighting games, doesn't matter if you're a casual or you complete in fighting game tournaments.  You would be doing a huge disservice yourself if you didn't pick up this game. And while you're picking up the game, make sure you pick up a decent gamepad or fightstick. The Xbox 360 or Dual Shock 4 controller just doesn't cut it.  Honestly in my opinion if other than the netcode issues this game is a perfect fighter on the PC. Capcom fix the damned netcode, this game is pure gold otherwise!  Pros:  + Huge roster with 44 characters to choose from; 5 of them being new to the game (Decapre, Hugo, Rolento, Poison and Elena. + Additional game play functions such as Red Focus and Ultra Combo Double help spice up the game. + Thanks to the character balancing the tiers aren't as high as they were in SF4 or Super SF4. + Tons of replay-ability. + Edition Select Mode gives gamers a reason to bring their friends over to settle the score on who was the most overpowered character. + Ability to upload game-play footage directly to Youtube in 720p + 28 stages  Cons: - That damned netcode - Youtube upload quality is restricted to 720p",

I would suggest you find some training parters who are experience if you are new to 2D fighters or fighters in general. If you don't, like me, you will get bodied so hard. The community is alright, people get really mad when they lose sometimes and might send you rage requests (an angry friend request). You need to learn so much if you want to find this game enjoyable online, everyone who seems to play now are either really good to the point where they spam shorykens and you can do nothing about it, really good because they abuse the lag, or really bad and cannot hadouken. Lag is pretty bad too, it cant mess up your combos or set ups. Story mode is nice.  TL;DR HARD BUT FUN, PLAY UNLESS YOU HAVE TIME",

It's still a decent game, and they have some characters from final fight in there which is great if you can remember that far back.  Also, other than the cinematics, it's still a 2d fighter, they should either add side stepping or just go back to 2D.  If you want a 3D fighter try DOA, if you like the 2D, try Skullgirls.",

            "review_text": "When they first announced there was going to be a Street Fighter 4, lo those many years ago, I was ecstatic. I'd given up on there ever being another after 3rd Strike, which was my all time facvorite fighting game at the time (and really, it still is). My excitement lasted until the exact moment I saw the first screenshot for SF4. 3-D graphics. I knew right then the game was in trouble, and sadly I was right. Every version of SF4, compared to 3rd Strike or any of the Alpha/Zero series, feels sluggish and slow. Achingly so. Characters move as if they're underwater. Animations are fluid, but take too long. This is part of the problem of moving from sprites to 3-D models, is that the 3-D models try to mimic the movement of the sprites from the older games, but they can't. They move oddly, and nothing feels right. Then the art style of the game assaults the eyes with puffy, bloated faces for everyone, and they all seem to have some sort of horrifying type of psoriasis.  And then the gameplay. Ugh. The Ultra Combo system is fundamentally broken on multiple levels, not the least of which that it's basically a reward for playing the game poorly. Doing bad, getting your ♥♥♥ handed to you? Have a free super move! The only way to build the Ultra meter should be via blocking attacks with Focus or doing damage like the normal super meter.  Throws are done with both light buttons rather than both fierce buttons, which is wonky and odd. No sir, I don't like it. Also, there's no post-KO inputs allowed, meaning you can't do any neat post-KO hits and earn extra points.  I can't speak for the online play because I never cared enough about this game to bother playing it online. Audio-wise the game is adequate. The punches and kicks are okay sounding. The music...exists, eliciting neither positive nor negative emotional responses. It simply is there. The announcer is ALMOST as annoying as SFZ 3's, but at least that one had the bonus of being in a much, much better game than this. The character voices, once you put them in their proper language (Ryu and Ken speaking Japanese, Dudly speaking English, etc.) are serviceable, though Makoto's voice in 3rd Strike was vastly superior. As was Dudnley's. Basically everything about 3rd Strike is superior to this game, except maybe the roster (though I have to deduct stupid amounts of points from the rostor for characters like Rufus or that red oil covered...thing. Seriously Capcom, WTF?). Honestly, I've tried several times over the years to play SF4, in most of it's revisions, hoping to see the game that other people talk about when they sing it's praises. However, I cannot. It's terrible failure-rewarding game mechanics, sluggish controls, forgettable music and weird oddities (Saving icon popping up in the center of the screen after every match, needing to hit alt+Enter to fullscreen the game since it's not in the option menu, etc.) all combine to form a game that seems tailor made to make me not enjoy playing it. 3rd Strike is faster, more technical, more skill-rewarding, and has more life and fluidity in it's 16 year old sprites than this game's clunky 3-D models. I'll go back to playing that, instead. Final score: 3/10",

There's little meat on the bones of this game and if you want anything else out of it, aside from multiplayer, you're going to find better options elsewhere.  The main problem with fighting games, nowadays, is that the developers focus everything into balancing the characters and designing the game around its multiplayer component. I understand that these games have a huge draw from competitive gamers but there is a lot lost in appealing to this demographic.  I'm not recommending a purchase for this game because it just isn't that much fun as a casual gamer. Especially when you compare it to superior titles like Killer Instinct on the Xbox One, Soul Calibur 3 and Mortal Kombat 9. With Killer Instinct the characters are far more interesting, and there is a lot more to do aside from competitive play (and with the new ShadowLords mode you can play for a LONG time without ever going into multiplayer). Soul Calibur 3 also has loads of content outside competitive play as does Mortal Kombat 9.  My point is, there are better options out there. This would be something worth getting only if it is on sale for really cheap, or if you're a diehard fan of competitie fighters. If you casually enjoy fighting games look elsewhere. There are better options.",

That said, I'd always try to give a non-biased and fair review, even if I dislike the game, however! Due to my impulse-stupidity, I neglected to check out the forum to see if this required GFWL, not expecting it to.   And, it does.   Games for windows live is, in my opinion, a ******* pile of ****. A scam even. It always was **** even when they thought it would be a good idea, but I do have to give MS credit for the fact that they actually managed to make it even *******! THAT my friends, is an impressive feat, as one would have thought it would be impossible.   GFWL, I could spend all day explaining the flaws, with things such as not being able to log into my account where it claims the password is incorrect, yet the website says it is correct, I could go into vast detail how the support is non-existent and when you finally do speak to someone, their rude as ****, I could go into great detail how no matter how many times you clear your cache, uninstall the program, reinstall it and everything else, it STILL won't work and I could give you many many examples of thousands of people with similar issues, all being ignored from MS. Their facebook filled with utter hate and they've stuck their heads in the sand, their twitter the same, their official forums filled with thread after thread begging for help, all ignored. I could tell you how this affects most of their games, with only a few being removed from GFWL and the others having no sign to it, or how, issues like mine are apparently because your HOTMAIL has two step verification on, yet this isn't fixed, explained by MS or anything, leaving one to find this out searching for hours on the internet...  I could spend all day explaining this to you and still never getting around to the actual gameplay of the game, because for many, it's impossible to actually even play the ♥♥♥♥ing thing.   So, in short?  It's a mother ******* scam.",

There isn't much for me to say since I just started taking Fighting games seriously about a week ago and this is pretty much the best way to start a fighting game.  Even though they need to improve the tutorials (Good = GGXrd/Skullgirls) and explain Fighting terminology and how to act on specific attacks. There is also issues with Arcade mode being bare miminum and pathetic in comparison to the singleplayer/couch coop stuff that MK9/X have.   Also if I dare say it. This game needs an Ultra Street Fighter IV Turbo edition. Some matches drag when it comes to zoning out and endless mindgame shenanigans. Doesn't need to be as fast as MvC3 or something like that. About the speed of an KoF/GG game, but a tad slower.  Everything else about the game is great. The balancing is better then most fighting games too. And the roster is large and lively in comparison to ♥♥♥♥ing Skullgirls where there are literally none...",

As more of a Blazblue fighting game player myself, I used this game to get my timings right and my inputs clean, seeing as how this game relies on timing quite a lot. The inputs are much more strict than those in games like Blazblue, so that might need some getting used to, but overall this game is amazing if you want to either add a new fighting game to your collection or get into fighting games.  About the online I have to say, there are a LOT of high skilled players on the Steam version, at least more than I encountered on the console versions, so that is a thing you should keep in mind. Also, the netcode is not all that great. When I play with friends that live in the same city as I do there is no lag, but if when I try to play with people from neighbouring countries (about 150km away) there already is a lot of lag.

This game allows you do that as the others even on the easiest settings can be so frustrating when you want to beat the last boss.

The new Characters in SSF4 AE are a let down, cause most of them a just another Ryu clone.  All in all I'm happy with this purchase and I really hope that Beat em Up games find their place on PC.   You definately need a decent controller to play this game! I would recommend any Logitech gamepad. Pro's swear on real fighting sticks. But the good ones cost much more than 100 € ;(",

That doesn’t mean that I don’t enjoy this one… I REALLY enjoy it, more when I win! :P And no matter what people say about the game being the same ♥♥♥♥ in every version… You don’t pay full price, and DLC’s are even better!!!  Complain about Call of Duty, 60 bucks for the game + 50 season pass… same game every year, sometimes even worst!!! And people pay for that ♥♥♥♥!!!! HELP CAPCOM!!! BUY IT!!!!

            "review_text": "Street Fighter 4 (Vanilla) -PC-  Street Fighter 4 brings the franchise back to its glory days of 2D fighting action. It has brought me more joy than Virtua Fighter, Tekken, SoulCalibur all combined. Street Fighter 4 is just head a shoulder above any other fighting game on the market. The game is simple enough for anyone who played Street Fighter 2 back in the day, but with all new combos, moves, and a gauge super move system, Street Fighter 4 is easily the best fighting since in years,  To be fair, I've always been a Street Fighter enthusiast. In my youth I was so captivated with all the memorable fighters like Ken, Ryu, Blanka, and Chun-Li and have always stuck with me. I loved the simple back stories and how they all came from different parts of the world and how it affected their very different fighting styles. Throughout each one of these fighters lives, they were directly affected negatively by the villain Major Bison. They make M. Bison out to be such a powerful merciless tyrant.  In Street Fighter 4, All of the original fighters reprise their roles. Some time has passed, but M. Bison is still up to no good. There is also a new cast of characters, 23 playable characters in all. This includes all the original 8, the 4 original bosses, 3 from Super Street fighter 2, and bunch of new ones I’d never heard of. Needless to say, there are plenty of characters at your disposal.  Street Fighter 4’s play style feels very natural for a seasoned veteran and newcomers alike. Pulling off special moves and short combos can be learned in a just a couple of minutes. Then learning in which situation exactly to use these combos can take much much longer. For more advanced players, there are some really crazy combos you can pull off. The game features a training mode where it will show you all the different combos, starting with easy ones and moving on to the more complex. The training mode it pretty huge and there’s one for every character.  And as fighters should, your characters are thick and have a sense of weight to them. The artistic style is a mix of cell-shaded cartoons and brilliant realism. It blends nicely to bring the game to life and to strike a chord with the nostalgia of past Street Fighter iterations.  In battle, there are 2 gauges present: the first gauge fills up as you take damage, the second fills up at you cause damage to your opponent. The “take damage” gauge can be released to perform a super attacks. This attack is a once a battle attack that can really sway the favor of the battle. This attack can be blocked or dodged if you sense it coming, but each characters attack is different and will come at you from a different direction or timing. The second “do damage” gauge can be used several times during a fight. When used, it will enhance your current special attacks to make them stronger. I found the whole gauge system very fun and it brought some spice to the action.  To unlock all of the characters you’ll need to beat the game with almost every fighter. I found myself spending hour after hour battling the computer for this means. Its very rewarding to unlock new fighters, but I do with there was an easier way to get them all.  The online mode is where the game really shines. Playing against the computer is one thing, but going up against a real person in another story. After spending some time against real opponents, you’ll soon realize that your small set of moves and predictable jumps will easily be countered, resulting in defeat after defeat. How I learned to survive is to play a ton of games and try out some of your own stuff. But just don’t get angry, keep playing and learn what works, and observe what the other players are doing right.  What i love about Street Fighter, is that I can always get better and keep learning. There are always competitors out there inventing new combos and devising way to win. The competition is always there. If you invest a significant amount of time in Street Fighter 4, you won’t feel short changed. I played the PC version and the Xbox 360 version, both versions looked great but the PC version probably looked better cause I have a good PC. I’m sure the PS3 version is just as good.  Street Fighter 4 just makes me so happy. It brings back everything I liked about the franchise and simply makes it better. I love the direction That developer Capcom has gone with this game and I’m planning to pick up Super Street Fighter 4 on the PS3. Street Fighter 4!

Therefore, the players playing this online are in general very, very good, relative to a new player. If you're new, expect to lose, and lose badly, for a long while until you can compete.",

If you want to get good at the game you must have lots of dedication and time and patience to finally start winning. performing combos can be complex as well as defensive strategies. Every character (almost) is completely different and choose the one that most suits your playstyle and just head to training mode to learn him/her. Aside from gameplay the character roster is extremely large for a fighting game with this much depth. Lots of old favorites return as well as some newer characters introduced in this game. The music in the game is also pretty good. They have remixed versions of the character themes which sound pretty nice, Especially Adon's theme and Akuma's/Gouki's theme. As for the graphics, they are pretty unique with the less catoony but non realistic paint brush styled characters with fairly decent and non muddy textures. The online runs pretty well since my review of the game and does not hiccup very often for me. Did I mention you can even download mods? Every match is always different and you will continue to learn things about how characters work, game mechanics, and how some people's playstyles work. You will constantly improve even if you lose, and don't get down if you lose because EVERYONE loses. All in all, it's a very good game for 30$ and I highly recommend it.",

When Ultra came out, it introduced many new mechanics that were not present in previous iterations of IV, like Red Focus, Delayed Wake-up, and Ultra Double. Having Capcom recreate SFxT characters Rolento, Poison, Elena, and Hugo into SF4 characters was not easy. Although Decapre is a Cammy clone, her combos and moveset are far different from Cammy (she's a charge character). If you are not familiar with Decapre's combos, check out some of Infiltration and NuckleDu's matches.  The new look of the menu gives the game a new coat. What I love about USF4 is the amount of technicality needed to master the game. The SFxT stages becoming SF4 stages were also not an easy task as they had to be altered as well as having every Tekken reference removed.  All though USF4's life cycle is near it's end, I would like to say my words and tell everyone that this is a beautiful game with outstanding visuals. The only thing we don't want to see in SF5 is a broken Elena.  USF4 is an important part of my life as it made me learn about characters like Abel, Decapre, Poison, and Juri. It also introduced me to some internet memes such as 'Profound Sadness/Munning', 'Mah Fight Money', and 'Keep It Classy'. When SF5 comes out, I am going to grind the game so hard, that I will be Abel to get Mah Fight Money.",
